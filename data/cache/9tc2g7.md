## Optimizing Batman

### Post:

So Batman in the 2017 Justice League movie is pretty useless. Cyborg is a way better hacker and pilot (*somehow* he is able to increase the speed of Batman's plane just by sticking his hand in the console), Aquaman and Wonder Woman are vastly superior brawlers, the Flash is basically unhittable when he's running at speed, and Super man is utterly overpowered and single-handedly wins the fight against Steppenwolf at the end. 

So my question to you all is this: How do you optimize Batman so he at least feels like he deserves to be on the team, rather than looking utterly out classed?

I've been thinking about this for the past few days, and have some ideas. First let's delve a bit deeper into why Batman is quite so useless in this movie and then I'll describe my proposed solutions:



The minimum amount of people a real life commissioned officer typically commands is a platoon (15-45 men). When it's just 6 guys you don't really need a person whose entire job is coordination, tactics, logistics, etc., - it's probably better to just have another rifleman. But once the numbers increase that job becomes utterly essential. Wars have been won or lost due to the effectiveness/ineffectiveness of a given army's officer corps. Yet the Justice League is just six guys (well 4 guys, a dead guy, and a girl), and so someone like Batman - whose greatest strength is an extremely sharp tactical mind - is kind of overkill and fairly redundant. 

This is compounded by the fact that the five non-Batman members of the Justice League mostly just charge and punch, charge and punch in an insane chaotic free for all. A real life soldier needs to know when to suppress the enemy, when to take aimed shots, when to fall back, when to advance, when to flank, know when *he* is getting flanked, know if he's being targeted, know how long he can stay in the fight before he needs to retreat or get resupplied, know were his allies are - in short, his job is way, way more complicated. And so it makes sense that a real life soldier benefits from having someone standing around who he can offload some of that mental burden onto who has a higher level view of the battlefield. In an ideal world, the officers are so effective the enlisted men think the logistics fairy just flies around the battlefield and sprinkles bullets onto all the good little boys and girls whenever they're running low. 

So how do you address both of these issues? Simple: Bruce Wayne hires an army. Batman's the peak of human physical perfection, but he's just a mortal man at the end of the day and we can't really get around that limitation short of implausible SUPER TECH like Tony Stark's power armor. But imagine an army of former special forces soldiers trained by Batman, dozens and dozens of them, all being fed constant tactical information during combat? Now we're actually taking full advantage of Batman's genius level brain. Against Steppenwolf maybe these guys get knocked around, but the primary thing the Justice League fights in the film are the winged humanoid bug-people things. And against those, a few dozen Navy SEALs would work wonders - they could clear the skies and keep the bug-troops suppressed while the Justice League's members who are good in a super human fist fight all gang up on Steppenwolf.

The next issue is Batman's insistence on trying to punch things. Batman is not a demigod, his skin is not bullet proof, his bones are not made of unobtanium, he doesn't have superhuman healing powers. When Superman knocks him into a police car, his whole back is one big bruise and it hurts him to move around for the rest of the day. So when he tries to go into hand to hand combat against foes that the superhuman members of the justice league are struggling with - it's just asking to get flattened. In fact the movie is probably a bit too kind to Batman, realistically if these creatures can punch Wonder woman so hard it hurts her they'd kill a mortal man. 

The solution? Stop trying to punch out grizzly bears, you lunatic! Normal people lose, badly, if they try to fight a grizzly bear in melee. So we don't, and instead carry high powered rifles or shotguns loaded with slugs. And this not only prevents us getting our faces eaten, it *completely* turns the tables. Humans exist at the tip top of the food chain thanks to our projectile weapons. So if Batman  knows he's going to be facing super strong super tough monsters that will rip a human being in half in close quarters, he needs to stop trying to pretend he's something he's not and use standard human response to such a situation. That is to say, bring a gun. During the final fight scene we do actually see Batman steal one of the bug-creature's laser guns and starts using it himself,  so clearly he's alright with killing these things. And he also frequently pilots a tank equipped with rockets and miniguns so he isn't opposed to the idea of bringing in heavy firepower to a fight. All he needs to do to equip himself with projectile weapons from the very start of the battle, and operate a bit more like Hawkeye as a sort of sniper who picks off the bug people at range. Except way, way more effective because high explosive 20mm anti tank rifle >> bow and arrow. This also rewards Batman's clever mind, as now the question becomes: What kind of gun does he bring? What kind of ammo is in it? What attachments does he include? It adds a whole other dimension of planning. For example when he revives Superman and isn't sure if Supes will come back evil, his backup plan could be a dozen drones armed with guns full of kryptonite. Superman may destroy most of them with his super human reflexes, but just *one* of the swarm needs to get a chance to fire. 

More-over, bullet proof skin doesn't mean guns stop working. A 50 BMG round packs about 40 times the kinetic energy of Mike Tyson's punches in his prime, and that energy isn't going to just disappear because "Well bullet proof I guess". Even if you're wearing a bullet proof vest that stops the penetration of the round, the sheer force of the collision would still probably shatter your sternum and kill you through blunt trauma (or perhaps the sharp energy transfer is mostly responsible, /u/zergling_lester disagrees with me on the exact cause :D). Far from guns being ineffective against super powered foes, they should be the only way a normal person can even stand a chance of hurting them. Batman with a M82A1 is hitting Steppenwolf probably at the level of a Superman punch,  while Batman with his fists is not even an annoyance to Steppenwoflie. 

Finally, although this isn't a solution to a specific problem, Batman should make more use of vehicles. In older iterations of the character, self-driving or remote-piloted cars were non-existent or very unreliable (e.g. autopilot on a plane) so it made sense Batman only ever deployed precisely one cool vehicle at a time. Yet in this film we constantly see Alfred take remote control over the batplane, batcar, bat....tick tank?, which implies there is no reason Batman can't have dozens of these things on station. Instead of rolling into Fictionstan to stop Steppenwolf with one plane and one armored car, imagine instead if he filled the sky with a dozen Bat Attack Helicopters loaded with 30mm chain guns and hellfire rockets. Sorry, 30mm Bat guns and HellBat Rockets. Or even just a few hundred DJI phantoms rigged with C4. Batman really needs to take more advantage of the fact that 1) He is insanely rich and 2) Semi-autonomous vehicles are a thing now. 

Anyway, that's my potential solutions to the Bat-optimization problem. What does this fine community think?

  I think that everything you said, mostly, makes sense, but the problem itself needs to kinda be re-defined before we can do anything.

  Honestly, the best thing anyone in the DC universe could do is explain to the Flash that he can win every single battle by himself and fix the entire world, if he felt like it.

  The amount of speed he gets up to, no one else would be moving, like, at all. The guy is recorded going faster than light, so it would literally be impossible to see him. In the face of that, well, batman would be infinitely more effective if he just made the Flash happy with food or something.

  But that's the thing about all of this. You are taking a very reasonable approach with some good thinking and applying it to a world/universe where absolutely nothing makes sense. 

  Steppenwolf, if he did actually punch batman, probably should have blown through his torso, if he can at all trade blows with Superman. Like, the main problem is nothing in the DC universe really makes sense, if you take it at face value, so unfortunately, while I agree with most of what you said, the first question should probably be:
  "How do we make the DC universe make any kind of sense, and then, once that is established, what could Batman do in that universe to be most effective?"

  Anyway, just my 2 cents, and hopefully my frustration with superhero comics hasn't overwhelmed my response, although I think it has definitely bled through.

    Make Batman the rational protagonist: the only character who thinks these things through in a world of well meaning super-powered idiots.

    For extra credit, reveal that there's something about the nature of super powers that makes people who have them worse at lateral thinking, and unable to imagine solutions outside of using their powers in a direct "comic booky" sorry of way.

    Bruce Wayne has figured this out, and knows that simply pointing out the obvious to super beings doesn't work. He created the Batman persona as a way of getting close enough to the Justice League to study the details of this phenomenon, and slowly guide them towards rationality.

    Maybe Steppenwolf's punch is so much weaker against Batman because Steppenwolf *expects* a superhero to be able to take his punch.
    ```

    - u/ianstlawrence:
      ```
      I agree with this, but the bigger problem isn't having a character that is rational, and then trying to figure out the other characters, its how you rationalize the powersets everyone has: here is a excerpt from a comic that has the Flash outrun death and time and some other concepts - https://imgur.com/a/pdgj1

      So, like, I get what you are saying, but what world are you creating with what physics that also has this iteration of the flash? And if you dont have this iteration of the flash which one? Can he still outrun light? Time? Where are the lines, and if he can ONLY run to near lightspeed, well, how does anyone ever stop that? If you literally do anything to endanger anything in the world he could speed up so much that he is unlimited possibilities.

      I don't know, I always find this stuff frustrating because trying to think through any of it feels impossible in a rational way. And the Flash is just one example, right? There are people like Dr Fate where, like, what's the rational version of that? How does Fate work? Or Constantine, and the fact that there is literally the One Above All, who is God, like God in the sense of unlimited and total power - http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/One-Above-All_(Multiverse)

      However, if you all want to just have fun and talk about Batman and stuff, sorry to be a wet blanket.

        The DCAU is pretty good for this. The heroes are nerfed big time relative to their ridiculous comic book feats, while still remaining true to the spirit of the characters and their powers. For example, [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a0pwb9NvFE) is the fastest the Flash ever goes in _JLU_; it takes him 10 seconds to run around the earth, putting his top speed at 4,000 km/s. Which is fast, but way below light speed (300,000 km/s). And that was a one-time thing.

        I'm suggesting that all superpowers in the DC universe share a common origin, and that that origin creates a blind spot in the user's reasoning *specifically around their powers*. Now that I think about it, this could also help explain the secret identity phenomenon; superpeople tend to cope with the subtle cognitive dissonance by creating two separate identities, one powered and one not.

        One way this could go would be like the Inderdict of Merlin from HPMOR: The Being that created superpowers set them up this way to prevent creative rationalists from accidentally destroying the universe by unlocking their full potential.

    Doesn't have to be Flash even. Superman can do everything Flash can and more. Flash is just a subset of Superman, to be rude.

    But yea. Batty should use his superpower, money. He should make sure superheroes get funded.

    He should bribe supervillains who otherwise rob people to join his ranks. 

    He should hire everyone whose superpower is building crazy shit like mister freeze to build things for his hired heroes.

    He should have a robotic army too.

    - u/ianstlawrence:
      ```
      I mean, it really depends on what comic you are talking about: https://imgur.com/gallery/dQk55qv

      But, let's be clear, if any superhero or villain's goal was money; they could easily make it hand over foot. Pretty much every villain in existence has a power that would allow them to vastly improve either the US military, which has a spending budget of trillions, or some corporation looking to sell their device/power/etc (e.g. Mr Freeze could possibly make cold fusion or cryogenics work).

      It isn't so much that I am disagreeing with you (except maybe the Flash thing) but that there is an innate problem to solve first. Cause, like, lots of villains have money or superheroes (they built the watch tower in space), and we've seen plenty of robot armies get destroyed, simply because robots aren't interesting, so of course they lose to the lone hero.

        Oh it's been fairly established that Barry is faster than Clark, but the real question is: Is Barry so much faster that Clark couldn't pull off all or nearly all of the same feats in a given situation? 

        Think of it this way. You have to choose one of your friends to help you move. Brandon benches 250 lbs, but isn't good for much other than lifting. Tommy caps out at about 200 but has a pickup truck and gets the employee discount at the local storage unit. Who do you pick?

  You are trying to put a rational character in not-rational-at-all universe. Don't forget, the inner laws of DC universe are the laws of drama, not the laws of physics. For example, no amount of faceless, nameless goons can defeat a main character in battle. Actually, if you think about it, a rational strategist in such a universe would notice that and would consciously only recruit people with interesting personalities and backstory for his army.

  ```
  The Bat-Army plan has been tried in various forms, though never quite to the degree you imply. First-off, the various Robins and other 'Bat-Family' characters essentially function as a well-trained army, of a sort. Second, the *Batman Incorporated* story-arc, where Bruce recruits various other Bat-types, including a number of foreign knockoffs, to help deal with international threats and that sort of thing. Finally, in a relatively recent story-arc, a villainous vaguely-government-affilliated group called the Colony tries to extend that concept out to an entire group, with surprisingly competent results, a large group fo them managing to swarm and incapacitate Batman, though predictably they get turned into low-level mooks who crumple after a single punch once there's no need to make them seem intimidating. 

  I know these are comic examples and you're talking movies, where Batman is shown as explicitly okay with shooting and killing people, but the 'just give Batman a gun' solution still irks me somewhat. I think it would add an interesting challenge to the proposed problem to not be able to use guns or kill people. Bat-bombing people with his bat-drones isn't really Bruce's *style,* y'know?

  If you do this, you are killing Batman and replacing him with yourself in a batsuit.

  The whole point of Batman as a character is that he is nuts, but manages to channel it in a more acceptable way than his villains.
  Going out and punching people isn't the most efficient way to stop crime, but Batman does it anyway. Unless there's a supervillain involved, beating up and arresting a single criminal is maybe one of the worst ways to stop crime!

  Batman comics/movies have dealt with this before; it's one of the most defining aspects of his character. A Batman that doesn't get personally involved is a Batman that dealt with orphanhood/trauma much better, and if that's the case what you probably get is Bruce Wayne, billionaire philanthropist, instead of a billionaire playboy with a secret life.

    Fair point, but I was trying to optimize Batman to be a valuable member of the justice league. And generally the league only gets together for supervillain-type crimes. Where it's less "Socio-economic problems lead to a sparsity of legitimate career options for young males, causing a spike in muggings, robberies, gang activity, and murder" and more "Dr.Nefarious has constructed a giant moon cannon, and unless we can defeat his army of gorilla-soldiers soon all of America will be reduced to yellow ash!".

  Do *not* try to optimize Batman, the entire premise of this particular superhero is unfixable.

  Why? Because he does not have personal, unshareable superpowers. He has training and a high-tech costume. In a universe where quality wins over quantity, a much better course of action for him would be spending time in the lab making custom costumes for other heroes, who do have a superpoower, cooperate with police, and maybe maintain a couple of Robins for emergencies. There shouldn't be a Batman.

  Problems with Joker? *Call Flash*.

  Than there is an angle that maybe Gotham could be fixed if Bruce starts paying decent wages to his low-rank employees instead of spending money on expensive toys.

  Bruce Wayne is a foremost industry captain with command of a significant portion of the production structure of the world. He should be correcting wrongs and bringing justice at the global systemic level, using such huge influence of his on creating or divesting jobs and regional development as fit to to corral around lawmakers, making and unmaking political leaders almost at will, into opposing corruption and enforcing human rights everywhere. He should be "Good Lex Luthor", in short.

  As a superhero character Batman makes no sense at all (and was never meant to make sense anyway). To begin with, the fact that his combat suit is not remote-controlled, especially considering that we're frequently shown that all his vehicles are, is utterly ridiculous. His personal income compares favorably with small nations' GDP, FFS, but he can't recruit and form even an elite combat squad of his own, and has to do everything himself ? I know, I know, demigod mythology tropes etc.

  That's just not how you use the superpower of megawealth. But then if the writers knew anything about making vast amounts of money, growing huge businesses, and using it all for for good, they wouldn't be writing comics I guess.

  The thing is, Superman and the Flash and others are really really good at hitting villains. Really *really* good. But they're not nearly as good at *locating* villains.

(It probably won't work forever, but it might extend their head start into a full day or more).

  I mean, the fundamental problem is that if you try to make a billionaire ninja who goes around in costume fighting criminals realistic, you stop having a billionaire ninja who goes around in costume fighting criminals. Superheroes aren't very realistic already, pretty much anyone outside of someone with Superman-level powers just wouldn't be that much of a force on their own. If they're vulnerable to bullets all their superpowers count for shit, they'll get killed. So we need to at least assume some kind of suspension of disbelief to make the concept of superheroes even remotely viable. 

  Otherwise, a truly "realistic" superhero story IMHO would need to make them work in cooperation with the police, and mostly exist as heroes for a PR boost (flashy, recognisable guys in costumes with superpowers would do wonders to both enhance the good guys' morale and scare the shit out of their enemies). My Hero Academia is probably on the right track there, though it still is very unrealistic with how the battles actually pan out (since most of its heroes have only *one* power, often not even a defensive one, but somehow manage to withstand stuff that'd kill a normal human multiple times over).

  batman solves problems by thinking. not by fighting, the fighting is just him helping when and where he can. his psychology skills help keep the team together and working for a common goal. 

  if you have a problem with how a specific version of batman isnt good enough, then your problem is with the writing, not with batman. lets look at the movie: he assembled the team, he helped motivate flash with 'save one person', and he had the plan to get superman back. without batman there is no team, just a random assortment of superheroes with no plan.

  IMO, the ideal ratfic version of Batman isn't a protagonist - he's an *insane but extremely intelligent villain*, like Metropolitan Man Lex Luthor but with even less common sense.  Don't think "how do I optimize this character" - treat him like Quirrelmort instead.  Batman and the Joker are strikingly similar concepts; the difference is just that one of them *mistakenly believes* that they're acting for Lawful Good while the other one *correctly believes* that they're acting for Chaotic Evil.
