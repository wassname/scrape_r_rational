  [Travels through Azeroth and Outland](http://destron.blogspot.com/2007/10/introduction.html) is excellent completed Warcraft fanfic exploring historical and cultural aspects of the world. Main character is undead wizard that is motivated by curiosity. He travels through world making research and interviewing people.

    Is there an epub or mobi file I can get?

      There is now: [MOBI](http://www.mediafire.com/file/8ccrywvoawzz93r/Travels_through_Azeroth_and_Outland.mobi) [EPUB](http://www.mediafire.com/file/vfzbw2e8s85rdyo/Travels_through_Azeroth_and_Outland%282%29.epub)

    Is it unreadable for those with no background knowledge?

    EDIT: for that matter, do you recommend WoW?
    ```

    - u/Wiron:
      ```
      It's shoudn't be a problem, it gives every needed information. Author had in mind that WoW lore is vast and disjoined, and most players don't read quests.
      ```

    - u/Bowbreaker:
      ```
      Not unreadable but maybe slightly less appealing since a lot of it is slice of life and exploring places and if you don't know anything about WoW it's just some fantasy world while if you're a fan it really deepens your immersion and understanding.
      ```

  I've recommended [Tenkyou no Alderamin](https://myanimelist.net/anime/31764/Nejimaki_Seirei_Senki__Tenkyou_no_Alderamin) before, but now that the series ended I think I can give a more wholesome recommendation.

  I'll try to keep it short

  Pros:

   * MC which is preaching for "science"/rationality
   * Show, don't tell
   * Interesting twists/solutions
   * Interesting characters, that also get development
   * Nice art
   * Good animation in the beginning, and smart use of animation at the end where the budget/time was obviously reduced
   * Interesting world

  Cons:

   * Elements of "Look at how awesome the MC is!!"
   * Less serious attitude in the beginning
   * There are some convenient Bad Guys^TM, though they don't have too central of a role
   * The animation does deteriorate somewhat in the later parts of the series

      Yup, I figure they needed something that sounded impressive.
      But was still bothering me as well...

  The theme for my recs this month are Death Game Portal Fantasy Deconstructions. 

  Let's start off with a video. It's something I've recommended before, [Kaizo Trap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIES3ii-IOg). Kaizo Trap is a youtube music video / game. It is based on platformers in general and Kaizo Mario World in particular. A very good watch, make sure you have nice headphones or a good subwoofer! I watched it a lot.

  Interested in something more text-based? I recommend the classic [NES Godzilla CreepyPasta](http://creepypasta.wikia.com/wiki/NES_Godzilla_Creepypasta/Chapter_1:_Earth_%26_Mars). This is a less literal in terms of Portal Fantasy, but you'll find as you read that it definitely fits the genre. A story to inspire horror, fear, hope, determination. Read it alone at night in a dark room!

  Now, no Death Game Portal Fantasy Deconstructions list is complete without of course, [Pony Island](http://store.steampowered.com/app/405640/). Pony Island is literally a death game portal fantasy game. It has mostly puzzles, problem-solving, and platforming. Just a couple hours of playtime, this game is meant to be played in one playthrough, start to finish. The game has you. Want to leave? You'll have to fight your way to freedom.

  I highly recommand all three.

  Undertale recommendations (all of these have extreme spoilers, be warned):

  [The Golden Quiche](http://archiveofourown.org/works/5296460), by /u/Sophiera . Excellent worldbuilding, interesting magic system, great characterization even for the OCs. She also authors a book on Amazon which I, annoyingly, still haven't gotten around to reading yet, so I would not feel it appropriate to recommend it.

  [Strange Places](http://archiveofourown.org/works/5170448), by AyuOhseki. Interesting variations of the original undertale story, includes the existence of the misanthropic "Player" without getting too meta for my tastes, at least. 

  [One by One](http://archiveofourown.org/works/4942816/chapters/11345293), by CourierNew. Haven't read this recently enough to give a synopsis, but it is an exceptionally good one from what I remember, and many people consider it a headcanon ending to the story.


  [Flowey is Not a Good Life Coach](http://archiveofourown.org/works/5056333), by unrestedjade. Goes in a very different direction from the rest, and frankly, I haven't and don't plan to finish it, but that's not because of it's quality. It's just too dark and psychologically-shaking of a story for me, though some of you may enjoy it.

  [The Thought](https://tratserenoyreve.tumblr.com/post/135227136600/i-had-a-thought-the-thought-continues-here), by tratserenoyreve. An impressive comic looking at what might happen if a certain nihilistic character took a more immediate interest in what's going on.

  edit:

  There is also [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/UndertaleAUs/comments/4ax1d4/heyo_want_some_fan_fiction_well_i_got_some_for_ya/) massive, curated list of fanfiction by /u/Cyrus67.
  ```

  - u/adad64:
    ```
    Oooh. I just finished Strange Places, and I'm filled with warm fuzzies and determination! I've been looking for a good Undertale fic where all three of the main characters were actually explored and forgave each other.
    ```

- u/Empiricist_or_not:
  ```
  Anne Lekie's [Ancillary Justice](https://www.amazon.com/Ancillary-Justice-Imperial-Radch-Leckie/dp/031624662X0)

  The story is ~~very~~ *YMMV* Rational with reasonably irrational actors.  It is centered around a breakdown of a biological based Imperial singleton/copyclan/multiple-clone-network that has problems  due to it's latency.  It's told by the surviving element of a servitor warship AI where the warships uses captured civilians as bio-based drones.  LOts of good identity discussion and implications extrapolated from some very bad substrate choices and some anachronistic elements.  

  (Edit: downgrading after some the good thread linked below)

    [We had a thread about Ancillary Justice some time ago, but it didn't generate much discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2ha5ro/th_ann_leckies_ancillary_justice/). I haven't gotten around to Leckie's sequel yet.

      I'm halfway through the second book.  The thread, and the my own problems with some of the straw-manning of colonialists in the second book triggered my edit walking back the very rational claim.  That said I'll probably finish the trilogy by Monday and render judgment then.  I am delighted, despite it's lack of physics porn, which is usually a requirement for me, I think the best endorsement I can give is the second book reminds me of a Science Fiction version of The Traitor Baru Cormorant with a more experience and capable protagonist.

      Edit: Typo: originally called it rational not rationalist.
      ```

      - u/Anderkent:
        ```
        Yep, also got Baru Cormorant'ish vibes, and enjoyed all Leckie's books, especially second and third.

        >There was a duck who was God,  
        who said "It's exceedingly odd,

        and I swim like a fish,

    If the Culture ever learned of Anaander Mianaai, they'd pretty much have to start an Idiran War-level conflict with her.

    She's an HS.
    ```

    - u/PeridexisErrant:
      ```
      > Total casualties [of the Idiran War] amounted to 851.4 ± 2.55 billion sentient creatures, [and] the destruction of 91,215,660 (±200) starships above interplanetary, 14,334 orbitals, 53 planets and major moons, 1 ring and 3 spheres, as well as the significant mass-loss or sequence-position alteration of 6 stars.

      I seriously doubt the elimination of Anaander Mianaai would be anywhere near as challenging; the tech mismatch is simply massive and the numbers are no better.
      ```

      - u/buckykat:
        ```
        Okay, so maybe they'd displace all of her into suns. But I meant philosophically. The Radch function as a sort of dark Culture, with all the interventionalism but spreading hegemony and taboos instead of freedom and interesting fun.
        ```

  - u/GlueBoy:
    ```
    I like the books and I like the message they tried to pass on about gender/sex, it's an interesting perspective on it and that's what I look for in my SF. 

    However, the author seemed to ignore or gloss over that humans are in fact a sexually dimorphic species. It's simple to guess an individual's sex with a very high degree of accuracy just by looking at height, for instance. If you add in fat distribution, body/limb size, muscle mass and so on, then it really breaks immersion that the AI is unable to use the correct pronouns when she has to. It becomes kind of condescending, actually. 

    Regardless, I second the rec just because it's a fresh approach to an old subject, and the plot is pretty interesting.

    I'm going to jump in here and recommend against this. I was intrigued by your post, and by /u/ToaKraka's summary, so I decided to start reading it. I got up through Chapter 74 before I gave up.

    It's got a really interesting premise, and I love the degree of detail that went into the plotting, character backgrounds, and seemingly throwaway details that emerge later on.

    The problem is the *writing*. The author has the issue where they over-rely on a few good tricks.

    For example, stylistically, the author does this a *lot*:

    >He went upstairs with heavy, tight-lidded eyes and laid down on Hajime's bed, on his back. He spread his arms and his legs wide over the mattress.

    >Trying to process.

    >Everything.

    >His mind had the pieces of a puzzle and he was determined to solve.

    >As much as he could, anyways.

    There were chapters where none of the lines wrapped on my screen, because every single paragraph.

    Was just.

    A single sentence, or a fragment.

    This is a technique that has its place, but oh god it is overused. It honestly kind of reminded me of reading a Wildbow story: I only got a little way into Worm, but I read all of Pact, and good lord does Wildbow just put his foot on the "this is a moment of crisis" pedal and not let up, where every single scene in the last half of the story is wrought with incredible tension. In The Blood does that, except with every scene wrought with pathos, angst, and shock. It's true in physics and it's true in writing, it's the *differential* that makes interesting things possible.

    Similarly, the writer has one character arc that they way, way overuse: it's "I am a deeply compassionate and sensitive boy whose gifts lie in areas other than combat, but am being forced into The Path of Badassery by Sasuke." There are a few variations on this -- one of these characters is a girl, one of these characters is actually really gifted at combat but just psychologically unsuited for it due to the aforementioned compassion and sensitivity, one of these characters is being forced into their path by someone who isn't Sasuke -- but it's just *not interesting* to get the same arc four times. There's all these other characters that show up in the first dozen-odd chapters that then get shunted to the side in favor of Sasuke Continues To Be Wrong About Everything, Forever. I was really disappointed, because I liked how it started and really dug the level of detail. But I don't think this story is actually very good.

    (But then, I also couldn't get through Time Braid, so what the fuck do I know about Naruto fanfic)
    ```

  - u/ToaKraka:
    ```
    A more-detailed summary:

    > 1. Sasuke has married Ino and had five children with her. However, the family relationship is extremely strained: Sasuke is very authoritarian, and borderline abusive, in his efforts to restore the glory of the Uchiha. He likes only one of his children, while constantly expressing disdain for the others, and hating one of them so much that he never even speaks to her. (The reason for this is eventually explained.) How will this situation turn out?

    > 2. While on a mission with his genin team in the Land of Rice (formerly the Land of Sound), Sasuke is astonished to see a boy who seems to be a clone of Itachi. Soon, other clones start turning up as well. Who is behind this? Has Orochimaru somehow returned?

    > Note also that the story actually is only 600,000 words--the last 200,000 consist of several epilogues and exhaustive author's notes.

    It's my second-favorite *Naruto* story (after *[Time Braid](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644)*).

  Mr Robot season 2 finished last month. The world does have some holes, it's not completely rational or rationalist, but it's the best representation of hacking I've ever seen in fiction. And the world is generally great, violence is swift and brutal, characters are motivated and have extreme flaws. You'll only need the first episode to know if you'll like it or not.

  I have been waiting for this thread ever since I watched [Zetsuen no Tempest](https://myanimelist.net/anime/14075/Zetsuen_no_Tempest). It's a magical murder mystery drawing some inspiration from Shakespeare's 'The Tempest'. While this might be an unorthodox recommendation I honestly believe it is the best anime example of rational fiction characteristics I have seen. I wouldn't disagree with saying it temporarily approaches rationalist even. At one point it has four main actors with different beliefs and conflicting values who are literally talking things out while updating beliefs based on new information. That part is in my humble opinion interesting even just for its novel use of predominantly literary dialogue in a naturally more action oriented medium.  

  Having said that, I am essentially recommending the show based on *that part* alone. It does also contain typical magical action elements and after episode 12 the show rapidly becomes noticeably worse in every way. It then takes waiting until episode 20 for more plot answers to appear.

  I understand that might sound negative but I really believe even the first half on its own is strong enough to consider. It's in a weird position where it's both great and bad at the same time resulting in its actual quality being very subjective. While certainly not for everyone, optimistically this is a good and rational anime that just happens to end semi conclusively mid season; With an epilogue you can skip to. If the linked additional plot information seems interesting please give it a chance.

  I'm gonna have to recommend Renaerys [Triumvirate] (https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11266745/1/Triumvirate) and its sequel [Clash of crowns] (https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11785261/1/Clash-of-Crowns), while I recommend you read both, Triumvirate is the more fictional an character based while Clash of Crowns is more political and ideological based!

- u/TennisMaster2:
  ```
  [Seed](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/seed-a-worm-au.340626/), a Worm fanfic that's terribly written with tense issues and stilted dialogue throughout, but very well crafted (so far) in plot and world building.  Its main conceit is Taylor gets Blasto's shard and uses science to become super powerful in order to make Brockton Bay safe.  Again, so far.

  If you can't mentally correct every word of almost every sentence for grammar and style as you read then it'll be hard to enjoy this.
