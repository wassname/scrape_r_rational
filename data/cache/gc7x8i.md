## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  You’re Superman. Your superpowers are to be able to go at a max speed of 99% the speed of light. You can output at a maximum 10^21 joules of energy before dying. Safe power outage of let’s say 10^18 Watts. Other powers are pretty much the same. Is there any possible way to move Venus into another orbit over a period of a year at most? He can’t physically move the planet as he will go right through it. At most he can push a kilometer wide and thick asteroid. His goal is to move Venus to Earth’s Lagrange point on the opposite side of the Sun. Thanks for reading.

    > You can output at a maximum 10^21 joules of energy before dying.

    Nope.  At least, not if my understanding of physics is anywhere near correct.

    Venus masses about 5x10^24 kg.

    Venus is travelling about 30,000 m/s.

    One joule is equal to a Newton metre (exerting a force of one Newton over the distance of a metre).

    Every second you're applying a force, you're exerting it over a distance of roughly 30 km.

    So, the velocity change you can achieve is represented by the equation E= m\*d\*v\*t, where:

    * E= 10^21 J
    * m = 10^24 kg
    * d = 30,000 m/s x (t)s

    So:
         10^21 = ~(5x10^24) * ((30,000) * (t)) * (v) / (t)

    The time parameters cancel out, leaving:
    v =~ 10^21 kg\*m\*m/s/s / (5x10^24 kg * 3x10^4 m/s)

    v =~ 7 x 10^-9 m/s

    Congratulations, you've altered the velocity of Venus to speed its orbit up by about 7 micrometres each second, which is far, far less than the rounding errors I've made in its mass and orbital velocity.

      Right that’s what I figured if he pushed the planet. Thanks for the numbers to verify though. I was thinking he could do something with his speed. I think I’ll go with creating a dense object to attract the planet though that might inadvertently create a core in said dense object. Thanks again for the calculations.

        No problem!  Thanks to you, as well!  Occasionally, it gets into my head that we should drop Jupiter into the sun as a way to extend our Sun's lifespan as a yellow dwarf, but I don't often have a way to grasp just how ludicrous (and, dare I say, *astronomical*) the forces involved would be.  You've helped put the issue to bed in my mind again for a while, so thanks for that.

    Ok, so, there are a few options that jump to my mind immediately.

    Dumb Superman:

    I can push a kilometer wide and thick asteroid.  Ok.  I'll assume it's also a kilometer deep for simplicity's sake.  So I can move on cubic kilometer of Venus at Superman speeds.

    Google says Venus is 938,000,000,000 cubic kilometers.

    Google kind of says it takes between 127 seconds and 870 seconds for light from Venus to reach Earth.  Let's round that to 600 seconds, call it ten minutes.

    So in twenty minutes I can move a cubic kilometer of venus to the target and be back on Venus ready to go again.  So 3 trips per hour, 24 hours in a day means 72 trips a day.

    365 days in a year times 72 trips a day means 26280 trips a year.

    So the dumb Superman plan (moving Venus one rock at a time) fails.

    Factorio Superman:

    One thing Superman can do is create Superman robots.  A superman Robot can do basically whatever Superman can do, except fight major villains.  In particular, they can carry out the Dumb Superman plan.

    Superman can make Y Superman Robots (SRs) per day, and the Superman Robots each do the Dumb Superman Plan.  It would take 938 billion divided by 26280 (total task divided by how much one Dumb Superman can do) Dumb Supermen to accomplish the task.

    So Factorio Superman needs 35,692,545 and change Dumb Supermen Robots to accomplish the task.  He has 365 days in a year, so he needs to crank out 97,787 Superman Robots a day.  Round it to a hundred thousand bots a day.

    Sort of.  Only the ones he finishes on the first day will get a whole year's work in.  The ones he finishes on the last day will get just one days work in.  Averaging the whole crew, we can simplify that each robot only gets a half year's work in (some more, some less, but it works out to about a half year productivity per bot).  So he has to make two hundred thousand Superman robots a day.

    Beyond that, Superman Robots aren't as good as Superman.  Exactly how not as good as Superman they are is more or less up to you, but I feel like we should factor in that they aren't as good as Dumb Superman at the Dumb Superman plan.  if you think half, then he needs 400,000 Superman robots a day, a fifth, then it's a million a day.  The roundness of that number is a compelling argument.

    So Factorio Superman succeeds if he can crank out a million Superman robots in a day, more or less the assumptions baked in above.  Lightspeed is super fast, and he is very strong, but is he that fast/strong?

    Paperclipper Superman:

    Superman Robots, of course, can do more than just carry out Dumb Superman's plan.  They can, one expects, carry out Factorio Superman's plan.

    The math on this involves so many assumptions that it's almost not worth doing, but basically if there was any way that Factorio Superman could ever have succeeded then Paperclipper Superman crushes it.  He builds a million on day one, they each create a million on day two, and then the trillion Superman Robots move Venus on day 3 in the first hour or so.

    The recursion is essentially almighty.  Even if Superman can't build a million, he can only build a thousand in a day, it very much doesn't matter.  If each of those thousand build a hundred, and then each of those a hundred more...you get the picture.

    Paperclipper Superman succeeds under almost any values you want to put in for how long they take to do stuff.

      he doesn't need to go with the pieces. he can just throw them.
      ```

      - u/WalterTFD:
        ```
        I was assuming that he had to fly along with them to slow them down and make sure they end up together instead of just colliding like pool balls.
        ```

    Since no one else has considered the fact that he can move at 99% the speed of light yet, I'll do that here.

    Accelerating a 1 km^3 asteroid (of average density 3 g/cm^(3)) to 99% c will result in it having a relativistic mass of 3 g/cm^3 × 1 km^3 × 1 / √(1 - 0.99c / c) = 3×10^13 kg.

    We can increase the orbital radius of Venus to Earth's by changing its velocity by Δv = √(GM☉ / \[average radius of Earth's orbit\]) - √(GM☉ / \[average radius of Venus' orbit\]) = -5240 m/s.

    The most direct method would be to just throw the asteroid straight at Venus opposite to its direction of motion. Plugging in the numbers, we get the change in velocity of Venus to be Δv = (\[mass of Venus\] × \[velocity of Venus\] - 3×10^13 × 0.99c) / \[mass of Venus\] - \[velocity of Venus\] = -1.829 mm/s. So, he'd just need to toss about 2.9 million cubic kilometres of asteroid at the planet for it to work. Since there's an estimated 3×10^21 kg / 3 g/cm^3 = 1×10^15 km^3 of asteroid just in the Asteroid Belt alone, it should be plenty. It's just a matter of how fast he can do it.

    As an addendum, let's have a look at what the crater would look like if we threw a 99%-light-speed cubic kilometre of rock into Venus. According to [this calculator](http://www.convertalot.com/asteroid_impact_calculator.html) (multiplying density by √(1 - 0.99c / c) to account for the relativistic mass increase, and converting a 1x1x1km cube into a 1.24km-diameter sphere, and impacting at 90° to the horizontal), we get a crater that's about 6400 km wide and 1600 km deep, with a volume of 2.6×10^10 km^3. The diameter of Venus is 12,104 km, and its volume 9.4×10^11 km^3. So, really, in about 36 asteroid throws we've already annihilated Venus, and everything after that would just be adding fuel to the newly-forming asteroid belt.

    So, yes. Superman might be able to move Venus into Earth's orbit, but it probably won't be intact enough to be of any use.

    I can't really calculate it, but if you can output that much energy, then you can construct anything you'd like, almost instantly. The limitation that you'll go through the planet is easily mitigated by smashing a bunch of asteroids together to make a highly dense object, then pushing that. But then you have another problem: This object is also very dense. Its gravitational pull might be an issue.

    You have a second issue to contend with: Earth and Venus cannot be on the same orbit because they have different mass. Of course, you could just add some mass from your asteroid construct, but if we're doing that, why not just destroy Venus and remake it?
    ```

    - u/Duck__Quack:
      ```
      I'm not sure why the different mass affects the orbit of the planets, could you explain? As I understand physics at this scale, everything falls at the same rate towards whatever it's orbiting, regardless of mass, so the orbits can be the same as long as the planets are far enough away from one another.

      Using my understanding, Venus can be moved to a new, higher orbit through expenditure of lots of energy. Google gives me numbers that tell me Earth is about 18% faster than Venus, and assuming the change of velocity can be applied over long enough that the orbit changes just from that, would take (I think) about 3.4E52 Joules, or just over 10^27 years at OP's safe power output of a billion billion watts.

      I did use the equations for circles and not ellipses, but the eccentricity of the Terran and Venusian orbits are 0.006 and 0.007 respectively, so I feel reasonable in that regard.

  Something for a story that's been bouncing in my head since the other day... what do you think could be a potential vulnerability of a massive AI-controlled structure (think Dyson sphere or something of that scale) that a human opponent could exploit, assuming they had a total advantage of surprise (e.g. the AI has reason to believe they are not coming at all)? I'm thinking stuff like infiltrating a main core and wreaking havoc on memory banks, CPUs, communication devices, and such. Also, normally such an AI wouldn't have a reason to have human-viable environments like pressurised cabins and corridors - but would you think it believable that they did if they were originally built by and for organic beings and thus still carried the need to make those sections as part of their core values?
  ```

  - u/CCC_037:
    ```
    The structure must obey any commands coming from a legitimate commander, e.g. anyone with the root password. Exactly what form the "root password" will take is of course not going to be advertised; it may include wearing the original IT manager's name badge, or being (more specifically, convincing the AI that you are being) the highest-ranking member of the original organic species that built it; or perhaps being the highest-ranking organic lifeform on the station capable of giving coherent commands to the AI.
    ```

    - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
      ```
      Makes sense. What about the centrality of control? On one hand, it seems like having a single, central core to handle all main processing is a vulnerability. On the other, on the scale of a whole solar system, lightspeed limit for radio communications is a problem, so preventing goal drift would be an issue if the AI had sufficiently intelligent subsystems - which meant they might want to have some sort of central core that goes "hey, you guys, this is our line, stick to it" now and then to keep everything coherent.
      ```

      - u/CCC_037:
        ```
        Instead of a single central core, perhaps you could have a central *council*, consisting of X central cores, which will repair and/or replace (if necessary) each other if one of them gets damaged, and which take decisions by majority vote. Higher values of X will increase both the robustness and the (original) cost of the system.
        ```

        - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
          ```
          Ah, good idea. Though it implies a tradeoff between numbers and swiftness of decision. There might even be a loophole ripe for exploitation there if you manage to make some core believe the others have been destroyed and act on its own as an emergency protocol - thus marking it as rogue and targeted for destruction to the others.
          ```

      Note: this could be done in the style of a fantasy story, e.g. "find the lost artifact that's the key to all the magic of the world". Overt sci-fi elements optional.
