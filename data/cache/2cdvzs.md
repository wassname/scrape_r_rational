  I liked the contingent plans on Milo's part. Makes sense for a guy of his Int score!

  Glad to see Hannah may be taking a larger role in Save or Die.

  Also, Milo's [ ] (#s "munchkinry bragging rights competition against his former player's new avatar") was great fun to read.

    I was a bit confused when Milo blamed her for choosing charisma over constitution, but it makes sense [given that](#s "he was kind of talking to his player/creator").

  Milo as adventure bait. This is brilliant. Not to mention existential-fu.

  That munchkin-off was beautiful.
