  They've finally done it!

  ```
  Really well done by the kids. I'm impressed.

  ... That's pretty cool. Honestly, I feel like the story could totally end here. Add a few pages, or a short epilogue that says "Now everyone is safe", and it would be basically okay.

    Kids were left behind. There's multiple houses. Not everyone is safe.
    ```

- u/CeruleanTresses:
  ```
  Thank god for the unspoken plan guarantee.

  Why do these kids have coat hangers strong enough to zipline off?
  ```

  - u/JulianWyvern:
    ```
    Presumably, they're made of actual wood instead of the plastic ones we see around.

      I have wooden coat hangers. I would certainly not trust my life to one.

        Would you trust a light 7-year old's or so?
        ```

          I was going to say *no*, given several of these things have broken at fairly low stresses, but I have a few spare so I thought I might as well test the theory. It held my weight for probably 10-20 seconds before breaking, with mild wriggling (I estimate in the range of 1.2-1.5g). So probably yes, actually.
