  I've read chapter one and part of two, and I'm not getting much of a rational vibe to it, let alone anything to do with Effective Altruism. The protagonist is a superhero who fights bad guys, and the story thus far consists of one really, really long fight scene.

  I sampled 1st chapter and part of the second.

  There are hints of effective altruism, but not much.

  Also, this Taylor is stupidly straightforward. One would think that utmost priority for a parahuman whose power stops working when she is seen would be *ways to prevent being seen*. The obvious idea is making a lot of smoke bombs, making suit out of them, igniting them all. If someone sees you, you turn into smoke-spewing teenager. As soon as smoke obscures you, you gain your powers back. Once smoke dissipates, you turn into smoke machine again. That's the idea I got by thinking about cheats for a minute. Taylor who lives this, whose life and death depends on it, would think of a hundred more cheats. She did not. I am disappointed.


  Also, I feel compelled to ask the questions:[Spoilers about ending of Worm](#s "Can Taylor win? If yes: Why did Simurgh choose this timeline? Why didn't Contessa involve Taylor in her Path To Victory right away?")

    To be fair, this Taylor probably doesn't have the budget for smoke bombs or flashbangs. Though the fact that she hasn't even been shown to have thought of them yet would put an upper limit on her rationality and/or out of the  box thinking.
