    Aren't the bonus chapters usually put out with the first release of the month?
    ```

      ```

  Oh. Black is going to go back. The betrayal happened, and Malicia is at ease. Black is going to kill her. Probably ~~after~~ before saying the words "I do not kneel."

  Edit: This is an incredibly stupid move on Malicia's part, but it also fits in perfectly with her blind spots. It's hard to say whether or not she'll expect it, but it seems that Black believes she won't.

      ```
      Yeah, the whole fathering thing has grown on him.
      ```

    - u/Morghus:
      ```
      Cat keeps getting pushed into further positions of power, that's for sure, but a Dread Empress is the last thing she wants. I suspect the thought, like before when she first heard the 'girl who climbed the tower' felt aversion. Or so it seemed

      I could be wrong, of course
      ```

  I bet scribe is a wreck.
