  Hey everyone! I'm super excited to be sharing this with you. Welcome to the beginning of an ongoing serial fic I've been cooking up for a while! I'll be putting out new chapters every Tuesday & Thursday. I've got plenty of backlog to run through and 2 chapters per week seems to be a pretty sustainable pace, so don't worry about running dry any time soon- we're going to be *going* some places, you and I.

  Have fun and thank you so much for reading!

  This is really cute, so far I'm reminded of Unsong for some reason. I'm looking forward to seeing where this goes.

  Munchkinry idea: track down somebody at Paizo (this will be the hard part, going by what's happening) and persuade them to publish a tiny sourcebook consisting entirely of overpowered feats and spells that are exclusive to Gold Dragons, in the hopes that they will then become available.

    Paizo?  Please.

    Pathfinder was originally written to be reverse-compatible with the D20 3rd Edition.  Try penciling in one of **those** Feats or skills and see if it gives you a result.  There's so much broken stuff there, especially in the Forgotten Realms books, that you hardly need to invent your own stuff.  Or, if you want Dragon stuff, the *Draconomicon* and *Races of the Dragon* already have quite a few interesting things in there.

    I recommend dropping a single point into *Autohypnosis* (From the Psionics Handbook) just to test it.  Losing 1 of 72 skill points isn't so bad, and if it gives you the ability to memorize things with perfect clarity and recall, it will be more than useful if it works.  Maybe later they can try third-party stuff too...

    Ha! Don't worry, the existing Paizo material is OP enough as it is. The *real* challenge is trying not to base the entire story around it, we already have Two Year Emperor which I love.

  Pretty interested to see where this goes.

  It's cute that we've got a married couple as our protags. Something different than a lot of ratfic.

  Gotta be honest here, I was expecting a totally different kind of story with that title, and then got totally human characters. Next thing I thought was these were gonna be metaphorical monsters. Hooo boy did you subvert my expectations, and also somehow confirm them? I don't even know what's going on and I love it. Can't wait for thursday!

    Funny story my original title was going to be even lower-status, I really wanted 'Dragon Wife' but it turns out there's a literal actual harlequin romance novel with that name. Whoops.

  Echoing some others, I for sure thought from the intro blurb & first few paragraphs that Haley was an angel in human guise. It's nice to be surprised by a new story! I'm in, looking forward to more :)

  I definitely want a whole lot more of this.

    On the way!

  > She had long black hair, and a full length black skirt to match, with a white jacket thrown over her shoulders to keep off the unseasonable chill.

  Based on the above quote her entire torso is uncovered as well?

  Now time to start the binge read. Love the 30 pounds of the ass end of a cat descriptor. That was the line that sold me on the fiction having a je ne sais quoi. You are having fun. It makes for an enjoyable read.
