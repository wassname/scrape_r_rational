  In this week's episode: minecraft in space

  I quite enjoyed the chapter, as usual

  ```
  I feel like Regan's plotline (thru chap 13 at least) seems completely disjointed from the alien encounter type events, can someone explain to me what's going on / the relevance?

    ```
    I don't think you're alone in feeling that way. I like the Regan story line because it's been a nice slice of "real life" that contrasts well with the main story lines. I feel confident that the plot lines will join up eventually. I'll be disappointed if they don't.
