  Very dark, takes a few episodes to reach it's stride, probably not the most rational tale in the world as I'm sure an A.I. with SAYERs capabilities would be much better at escaping the confines of it's utility function, but I very much enjoy it. 

  There is a bit of a dark bit in the middle after episode 12 for about ten or so episodes where it doesn't seem like any of the episodes have any cohesion, but the current plot arc is sooooo good it makes me recommend powering through it. I can give a list of the offending episodes as well if asked.

    Well I enjoy Cthulhu and friends, so it's probably worth listing till 12.

    - u/GrecklePrime:
      ```
      I don't know a thing about Cthulhu and Friends.  What's it about?
      ```

- u/Transfuturist:
  ```
  NOT THE BEES
  ```

  - u/GrecklePrime:
    ```
    What are you talking about,  there are no bees on Typhon.
    ```

    - u/Transfuturist:
      ```
      Remain calm, and do not break any glass marked "Break glass in case of emergency." That glass is remarkably expensive to have shipped in.

      I like it.
