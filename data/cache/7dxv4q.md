## I am... Not a fan of Worm and A Practical Guide to Evil, I'd appreciate feedback as to why.

### Post:

Both of these receive a fairly large amount of praise from people who love the same fics I do, and I just don't find them rational, nor compelling.  Has anyone else read the first 40 or so updates of either of these and been left with a bitter taste? Why?

Alternately, what do you like about them? They're better than a lot of books in the shop, but to me don't seem to compare to the truly exceptional fics out there.

EDIT: I created this mainly in the hope that I'd encounter some analyses that would change my mind, not because I want to dislike these, or have great faith in my sometimes poorly worded objections. If I could dig these that would be a ton of writing to enjoy.

  Worm isn't really intended to be rational. The characters/protagonist are smart about some things, like power use and immediate problem solving, but not about other things like morality or introspection. Taylor is a very flawed person, and that's very much intended. I don't think anyone on this sub looks at her ruminations on the morality of what she's doing and goes "Yes, that's smart, that's the type of thinking everyone should have". It's a popular book on this sub because the world has fairly consistent rules, because it deconstructs or examines aspects of superhero fiction in a way that little else does, and because people win by thinking through things instead of via Deus ex Machina or because their powers are naturally stronger than others'.

  Characters applying values differently to other people than to themselves is a recurring theme, and it's pretty realistic in that way. From a rationalist perspective, it's more of an examination of the biases people have and why they have them than how people can reject and overcome those biases.

    Worm's definitely in the category of novels that become a vastly more enjoyable once you realize the author is in on it.

    A lot of Taylor's scenes take on deeper nuance and meaning once you realize that she is not always right or even rational, and that this is a deliberate choice made by the author.

    I don't particularly think it matters whether Worm is "rational fiction" or not, because it is amazing and thematically rich fiction that explores humanity in ways that a lot of my favorite rational authors would not be able to.

    Edit: /u/slinkinator if you're still having trouble, consider the [We've Got Worm](https://www.reddit.com/r/Parahumans/comments/5yfs9d/weve_got_worm_podcast_episode_1_arc_1_gestation/?st=ja74s1v5&sh=73ec3102) podcast, it does a *great* job of recontextualizing a lot of interactions in the story and explaining in a really direct what this says about the characters, themes, etc of the work. Worm is an incredibly rich narrative work that goes out of its way to not present itself as such, and I think reading it only on the surface level is missing out.

    There is a difference between rational fiction and rationalist fiction. Worm is, I think, considered to be something like the former, but nothing like the latter.

    Specifically, Worm is very satisfying to people who like their stories to be... "closed-world automatons"? It's the quality that Tragedies have, and good Mysteries have: that the characters and the setting are *consistent* in ways that let you predict a lot of what is going to happen. The characters might be irrational, but they're irrational in precise, predictable ways that let you ask yourself "what conclusion would a perfectly rational agent—but for [this known set of flaws]—draw in this situation" and end up coming up with the right answer as to what's going to happen.

      THANK you.  Worm is almost certainly considered rational fiction, and almost certainly not considered rationalist fiction.

  I don't like A Practical Guide to Evil.

  I like Worm's emphasis on... I'm not sure how to put it. Logistics? Mechanics? Worm talks about heroism in a practical way. A lot of thought goes into equipment, power utilization, power function, etc. It's not a how-to book, but it's closer to a how-to book than the average novel about people with powers. People use powers for mundane utility, or in conjunction with ordinary tools, or for creative applications, in a way that feels very real.

  There's also a feeling of empowerment with reading Worm, because of this mechanical focus. Almost every problem can be solved, with enough advance preparation and cleverness and willingness to run away, and when problems are solved it does not feel artificial because the details are done so well. Threats escalate over time to force character growth in capabilities, but the difficulty of pulling off solutions always increases relative to the level of escalation.
  ```

  - u/Geminii27:
    ```
    Yup. Worm feels less like standard superhero fiction and more like Reality Ensues - people who practise things get better at them, hard work pays off, sometimes luck goes the wrong way, and there's less of a mindset - at least with Taylor - that powers are something which must only be used when in costume, or that fights must adhere to Queensbury Rules, or that people are either super-boy-scout Heroes or cackling mustache-twiddling Villains, and never the twain shall meet. It feels a bit more like the Whateley Academy universe, where smart minor supervillains work under the radar, there *are* supers who have been both villain and hero at times, and one of the central original story concepts is that heroes can and do often have deep secrets.

    Worm's capes are flawed. They're *people* - they have their own individual mindsets and ways of going about things, and sometimes those blur or straddle the lines between Hero and Villain. Particularly when there are Endbringer fights, which force everyone with powers to work (and often die) together. That tends to break down the artificial "us vs them" barriers, and introduce more of a "human vs Unknowable God-Thing" distinction which is always lurking the background, corroding the standard tropes.
    ```

    - u/chthonicSceptre:
      ```
      Unfortunately, Worm didn't have this feel for me. Just for instance, there is actually a huge emphasis on the Queensbury rules: after being told that capes never use guns because of potential escalation, there are literally only two instances in the story where capes use guns in a plot-relevant manner. I think there's a supervillain who uses a sniper rifle who has one appearance. While the characters who are powerful enough that guns are pointless get a pass (as does Miss Militia) I can't see any reason the main characters never get them. Not after their city is turned into a flooded war zone, not after they're invaded by marauding serial killers, etc.

      Even non capes do dumb things, somehow. When the Undersides rob a bank, why don't the police have snipers on every roof around the bank... like at all? I'm pretty sure the robbery was long enough for that to go down. Stuff like that. And any explanation that has the words "Contessa" or "Shard" in it misses the point, because a) those are the idiot ball personified and it's unsatisfying because it's a cop out, and b) we don't know about those until the end, so the reader is left scratching their head for a million plus words.
      ```

      - u/Mowtom_:
        ```
        It's the Endbringers.  If heroes do things like set sniper rifles on villains who aren't killing people a la the Slaughterhouse Nine, the villains stop being willing to show up at the Endbringer fights.  If you look at how Endbringers get defeated, sometimes it is just Eidolon stalls until Scion shows up, but other times you have people like Lung who carry the day, and they wouldn't do that if not for the "unwritten rules" that you don't sniper rifle the average villain.
        ```

    I guess my big issue with work is the inter character interaction then.  I don't remember the challenges and solutions building very well, but I'm down to accept that I might just not appreciate it.  What really gets me down is the idiotic and not particularly consistent social strength of the characters.  They seem to hold certain values close to heart, but only until they talk to someone else, or in the case of the main character until she's has a few minutes to think, where on she decides that she should roll back any character development that would lead her to being a badass.

    I guess my issue with aPGtE is a little bit of both. Weakly represented intercharacter relations, in addition to weak problems and weak problem solving, with a extra large dose of Deus ex machina.

  Never read worm but practical guide is a fun deconstruction of the Lord of the Rings fantasy genre mixed with strong characters and a sense of scale of abilities that isn't often done well.  

  Catherine looks and acts like someone who was pushed well beyond what she could bare and kept herself together by convincing herself it was for the greater good.  Problem is, she actually **is** willing to do what that entails, and as time goes on her solutions are more and more pragmatic in the HPMOR!Dark Side version of pragmatism IE "I don't have time to redeem every motherfucker I come across, they either die or fall in line because I don't can't spare them any more thought."

  This leads to her to becoming very good at her chosen field IE murdering those who disagree and getting the survivors to fall in line, hell, just look the Gallowborne.  Unfortunately for her (and some of her agency) she has put no points into diplomacy, she honestly has neither the time nor the inclination.  This leads to her getting screwed over by Heiress or Malicia or the First Prince or whoever in the long run because she just ignored politics as a thing-I-don't-have-time-for.  This can leave a bad taste in your mouth, especially as the amazingness of Malicia and Cordelia Hasenbach becomes evident.

  In the end though, I find the whole thing rather satisfying, especially the outside-view chapters where everyone is all "how the fuck did she do all this and how the fuck is she still alive?  WHAT DO YOU FUCKING MEAN SHE MUGGED A FUCKING ANGEL?" etc etc.

  Of course, I like deconstruction in general and the characters were just what put it above the rest for me.

    So, I appreciate a lot of what you're saying, but it was really her POV mugging an angel that killed it for me. The author seemed to take too much joy in it, the scene was pretty bloated, and I couldn't reconcile all the previous descriptions of insanely powerful angels with her interaction with it.  It seemed a little bit too lucky to me, and because every character is a Hero or a Villain with tons of potential and an empathetic backstory, it's harder to accept that the protagonist wins just because.

      This was kind of set up a lot along the way.  She has admitted a lot of times that she is not a good person, and is okay with that.  She is willing to become a monster for the sake of the people of Callow.  She didn't quite *get* that until she was faced with the screaming voices of the heavens inside her **demanding** she regret what she did.  Then she finds that she really doesn't, even if she should.  She is a monster, heart and soul, and has done everything for a greater purpose which she does not regret.  Angels are bound by stories, they are not..... creative.  They do a thing and that's it.  Contrition finds your sins and makes you contrite with them, but they can't really change you if they're not actually sins (at least to you), which is, admittedly, rather unique so far.  Evil acknowledges they commit sins, that they are, in fact, Evil.  Catherine proclaims herself a monster for a greater purpose, and that her sins and all the blood she has shed is worth it for the greater *good*.

      The problem that's going to bite her now is the fact that, okay, she's a monster and she's been doing what's pragmatic not what's ethical for a while now.  Has she accomplished anything?  Has it been worth it?  Saying it's for a greater cause is a great thing to say, but does it actually end up being for a greater cause?  She now faces the Choir of Judgement, and is going to be faced with the fact that she hasn't really improved the quality of life of the people of Callow.  She's going to face judgement incarnate with the blood of thousands on her hand and they're going to ask her "Was it worth it?"

      Dude, it was a joyous scene.  It was a plan coming together.  It was pulling one over on the Lawful Good mind-rapers.   I'm not really surprised that you wouldn't have enjoyed it, if you didn't enjoy what came up to it.  Why would you expect to enjoy the celebration if you didn't like what was being celebrated?

      They were forced to interact with her in the manner they did because she managed to set herself up as the narrative protagonist for that short period of time.  She won because she was able to use a narrative structure to make herself 'the protagonist who gets resurrected'.  Her later ploy with the Winter Court makes this entire concept much more explicit, but this isn't a thing you can just do with a whim and a prayer.  You've got to play the part, fit the role.

      Fundamentally, in PGTE, the more primeval a character is (barring demons), the more they must bend to narrative causality.  There is nothing at all suspect about angels (second only to gods in narrative causal binding) being forced to act in certain ways in keeping with a narrative for no other reason than the narrative the character asserts demands it.

      If that doesn't seem appealing to you, then yeah, I don't know what would make you enjoy the series.

  With the Practical guide to evil, I'm starting to sour on it. 

  Mainly because I found the Calamities compelling in the way that they hacked the story conventions and worked around them.  

  With them,  it always seemed very careful and discussed and tactical.  They seemed like focused adults who very well knew that they were pushing against the forces of all creation.   

  As the story has gone on...  Cat has become more powerful, but also much more cavalier.   The Calamities had to overcome other people's plot armor which they did through careful study and planning..  In book 3, Cat seems to have her own plot armor.  

  I remember in one of the recent ones,  Cat purposefully surprised Masego during the middle of a supposedly critical combat.  That took me totally out of the story as she wasn't treating it as "we are one mistake away from total catastrophe." instead it seemed like "I trust my plot armor to protect me from pulling stupid stuff in a critical battle."

  It took me out of it a lot.

    I'm not souring on PGtE yet, but yeah, this bugged the heck out of me too. That, and when Masego and Cat had the option to catch Archer as she was falling in a recent battle. Masego's ready to do so and Cat's like "Nah, let her break her fall on that house, it'll be funny."

    Archer's one of the strongest forces in Cat's army - why in the world would she risk letting her get seriously injured!? It was a terrible tactical decision that was seemingly done just for humorous byplay - not at all how a commander would handle a valuable asset, or a leader should support a teammate.

        That's exactly what was worrying me about it! Recently she's been relying on story tropes to play the system - which works OK in Arcadia, where all the fae are literally bound by tropes - but not so much in Creation, where the tropes always end with the villains losing. Granted she's fighting fae now, and another villain later... but if she keeps relying on narrative to see her through, she's screwed when she goes up against heroes again.

        Hoping that as of today's chapter, Winter's influence on her will be significantly lessened or ended, and she'll stop making these kinds of choices in future conflicts.

      Named are notoriously hard to kill, and Archer is pretty darn skilled.  I don't think there was any real danger in her being seriously wounded, and Masego is pretty good at healing, even if so.

  I have... mixed feelings on Worm and Practical Guide. You know what? Practical Guide review time!

  ---

  I think *A Practical Guide to Evil* is a mix of three genres: young adult anti-hero epic, political intrigue, and meta-story telling. I tolerate the first, love the second and hate the third.

  Catherine is basically the archetypal female young adult character. She's grown up in a difficult environment, seen suffering and misery, learned to fend for herself, she's the Chosen One but she's building her own destiny. She's baaaasically Katniss Everdeen with more agency, and a rationalist spin ("most heroes try to do X, X doesn't work, I'm going to try Y instead"). So if you don't find this type of character compelling... yeah, ain't gonna work out.

  Personally, I love the worldbuilding and the political elements. Stuff like the idea that Amadeus made the Imperial Legion more popular by having it patrol areas controlled by corrupt nobles and corrupt police forces, or the idea that Callow and Praes are doomed to fight because Praes has a constant overpopulation problem and needs to invade Callow to either cull its population or import food (which was also a theme in OotS).

  On the other hand, if you forget the big picture plan of "unifying Callow and Praes through common enemies" for a moment, the day to day reality is pretty grim. Catherine is working for an Empire that has consistently been an oppressive Tyranny for centuries, and just happens to currently be getting more progressive. Her plan to unify the region entails a lot dying, suffering, and civil-war-ing. The story doesn't pull punches on the fact that every battle has casualties, and every manoeuver requires sending soldiers to their deaths. Maybe you don't like the frequent reminders that a lot of people are dying in the depicted conflicts.

  The meta story-telling is when a character goes "I'm a villain and he's a hero, that means he's going to win because stories!". I don't have much to say on that except I don't like it. It's another thing that drawn from *Order of the Stick* (Black is basically a cross between OotS' Tarquin and Darth Vader), and... I dunno, it's not very interesting to me. I'm not really a fan of 4th-wall breaking, unless it's used sparingly in comedies, so the whole idea of "We know we're in a story, so let's use strategies that will work because we're in a story" doesn't really appeal to me. I prefer the parts about logistics and politics.

  Also, I know that "Evil" is in the title, but I don't really like the parts where they start to discuss Good and Evil. Despite what Star Wars would like you to believe, there's no ideology of Evil. There are weird Satanist cults, and philosophies of rationalizing why it's okay to be selfish, and you can always use some variation of individualism and "The only virtue is being strong because Darwin / because good and bad are subjective / whatever", but essentially, everyone either believe themselves to be "Good", feel like they're not "Good" but would like to be, or don't care and think the idea of "Good" is pointless.

  So while I understand that the setting has a whole divine eternal war between order and individualism and how they basically map to Good and Evil in human societies, I still find it weird when the protagonist goes "We are the villains!" even though she has a pretty strong sense of ethics. Same thing for Worm, I have trouble taking someone seriously when he's saying "This person is a villain!" Who does that? If you want to use labels, use "criminal" or "murderer" or "scumbag", but having cops talk about "villains" is just silly.

  ---

  So that's my take. If you maybe have more specific feedback on Practical Guide and Worm, maybe we could help you figure out what you like better?

    This isn't fourth-wall breaking. From the perspective of the characters in the story, the fact that the universe partly runs on tropes is as much a law of reality as physics. It's the author's perogative to set up the rules of the universe however they want, so long as they are consistent.

    Like Philip K. Dick said, "reality is that which, when you stop believing in it, doesn't go away." It doesn't matter how bullshit the rules may seem to the reader, they're the reality the characters have to deal with. If the characters said "that's really stupid" and tried to ignore the tropes, their actions would likely be highly sub-optimal. Remember, rationality is systemized winning.

    In some ways these sorts of situations where the rules are unclear (and bullshit) can be more interesting than those where the rules can be systematically pinned down through rigorous experimentation and used to formulate complex solutions to problems. Making decisions from very limited information is a *really* hard problem. As an analogy, contrast a hard science (e.g physics) with a soft science (e.g economics). Physicists may look down on economists, but in many ways the economists have the harder problem: there aren't any nice, neat mathematical models that almost perfectly descibe everything down to a ridiculous degree of precision. The best economists may be able to produce is a bunch of ad-hoc models that rely on dubious assumptions and frequently fail catastrophically, but that doesn't make their work any less valid or important.

    My point is that being able to draw useful conclusions from limited information when the rules are messy and complex is an important skill, and more challenging to the characters than a world with "sensible" rules. Characters may not be able to come up with as complex or intelligent-looking solutions, but the solutions they manage to produce are that much harder earned. This can be less satisfying for readers, though (i.e. Sanderson's First Rule of Magic), and can enable the author to "cheat" by arbitrarily introducing solutions or challenges in a manner utterly opaque to the reader.

    I agree with pretty much every point you made. The meta story elements are probably the weakest bit of the story because they don't feel predictable (like the conclusion of book 2). Maybe if the rules of manipulating the meta-fiction setting were explained in more depth it would help it feel more like sufficiently understood magic. But as is, only really the rule of threes seems to be fully outlined and even that feels arbitrary concerning what is considered a win, loss, or draw.

    I still like the story despite this, but that's probably my biggest complaint with it.

    Also, I don't think it's fair to compare Worm using the term "villain" to Practical Guide having people call themselves Evil. In Worm it's explained that the system of Heroes and Villains isn't something that exactly sprung up naturally, but is rather a calculated thing to control public perception. And a lot of the Villains wouldn't actually call themselves villains either, like Kaiser and other people who are pushing an ideology.
    ```

    - u/CeruleanTresses:
      ```
      I don't know, I feel like the meta-fiction rules (and ways of exploiting them) have been fairly consistent, especially since the fae showed up. I can think of three times off the top of my head that someone has used an archetypal story to their advantage (spoilers follow for anyone who isn't caught up): [](#s "Catherine using the "mysterious child with a claim to a noble title" story to bullshit her way into a fae title; Thief using the "theft of fire from the gods" story to get away with stealing the sun; the Bard painstakingly setting up a "hero vs monster" conflict to guarantee Sabah's defeat against a less experienced foe.")

      My interpretation: Following an archetypal story is a path of least resistance. If you set up the right conditions for a story, the universe will facilitate that story playing out in a predictable manner. Therefore, it's useful to arrange a story whose archetypal outcome benefits you.

          Short version: there's a lot of debates and frustration online about some aspects of Worm's worldbuilding that explain why capes work the way they do. Stuff like "The shards make the capes more likely to conflict", or "capes who just use their power for money are rare because the system is set up to create Heroes and Villains", or "Tony Stark isn't curing cancer because when he tries SIMURGH IN YOUR FACE", etc.

          Without getting too much into details, it can be seen as clever worldbuilding justifying superhero tropes, or as annoying rules depriving characters of their agency.

  Do you have any clear thoughts as to what you find objectionable, unenjoyable, or irrational about them?  Far easier to begin a conversation based on that than to list all the varying things that cause others to enjoy them. 

  If not, may I suggest you put thought towards clarifying it for yourself?  I realize that this may be part of the reason you posted, but it’s difficult for others to predict all the nuances that combine to make up your thoughts. We could then provide input and opinions regarding those thoughts. 

  Mostly I think we would discuss the parts you find to be irrational. I can definitely understand if the style of these fics is not to your tastes. 

  EDIT: didn’t read the other posts before responding to this comment thread. Productive conversation has ensued, OP’s point has been clarified. I consider my question answered, and point I made herein no longer relevant.

    This sounds as though you are asking for points you can rebut. I find it often leads to an argument of the form "No, that aspect actually *is* enjoyable, for the following reasons..." or "That's part of the appeal." Neither of these sorts of arguments does anything to help me enjoy a work. I find it hard to imagine you aren't winding up the OP just to be condescending when he finally does reply.

      *Not relevant to larger thread discussion*

      I had a response here that I deleted after I read all the other responses. 

      With regards to your point - I can see how it could seem like I was trying to set up a straw man for me to knock down. Totally get it. Not what I was aiming for, though.  I was trying to clarify what areas were those he found unenjoyable, so I could talk about the reasons I either did or did not enjoy those specific points, instead of writing all my thoughts on the works in general. 

      Given that others in this thread managed to clarify that point through discussion of what they thought, I concede that my question was not the best way to go about answering OP’s question. 
      Especially since, upon reflection and reading of other comments, OP didn’t seem sure of his own reasons and was looking for us to help clarify his own thoughts.

      I think maybe you might not be a fan of constant escalation. You're probably more interested in the munchkining and exploration of systems than you are the drama of overcoming ever-increasing obstacles with the odds stacked against you.

      All the stories you listed seem to be more about about smart characters exploring their worlds and trying to find optimal ways to deal with their problems. Whereas Worm and APGTE are more heavily drama/action focused with worldbuilding/optimizing as a means to drive the drama instead of as the main focus.

      So that would be my guess as to why you don't find them appealing.

        Worm was bad in that regard, but there were enough down times that I made it through. Pact (also by Wildbow's) was much worse in that regard, and it got to the point where I stopped and couldn't continue. Reading it was just too stressful!

        I've stopped (maybe permanently, not sure) with PGtE for the same reason.
        ```

- u/pizzahotdoglover:

  Brave of you to post that here!


  While I wouldn't say that either story you mentioned is strictly rational fiction, what I personally like about them, Worm especially, is their high level of realism within the established boundaries of the story. For the most part, the characters behave like real people would if they got powers, and to the extent that they don't, there is a satisfying in-universe explanation as to why. This is in contrast to most other super hero and fantasy stories (super hero stories especially) where characters often do things that make little sense from their perspective, just because it's necessary to move the plot along. 

  I would even suggest that the prevalence of this issue in these genres is the source of much of the enthusiasm for the stories you mentioned. People who love these genres but are still bothered by that they often suffer from this issue, are understandably very excited when they discover great stories like Worm or PGtE that avoid this problem.

  I've been feeling this a lot lately, especially in regards to PGtE. I just... don't like it very much. It had promise in the beginning, but now the whole thing just feels like multi-chapter battle after multi-chapter battle, with superficial casualty numbers that become more and more stupidly unrealistic every time. I didn't care about the demon arc and I care even less about the fae arc, so... been a while since I actually gave a shit about anything that was happening in the main story. The snark is more grating and silly than endearing to me, "the woe" is a stupid name, Cat's victories don't seem particularly earned, the overarching plot is very much Worm with a fresh coat of paint, and the aspect system...

  Well, that's gonna require a whole separate paragraph because I hate, hate, HATE the aspect system. What could have been a cool, interesting way for villains with the same name to distinguish and differentiate themselves is... super lame. They've become superattacks *activated by saying the name of the aspect ffs* and that's never something I wanted from the aspect system. When they were first introduced, I thought they'd fit into this whole theme of getting powerful by following the story vs. gaining advantage by subverting it but that's a theme that has been largely wasted.

  (Also I think I was doomed to dislike the story regardless because I've never been a fan of elaborate settings with pages of exposition on each minor principality. But that at least I can see being a strength for others).

  Worm, on the other hand... I liked it. Up until the S9 redux arc. If one of the S9 clones had been a shark-man and Taylor had jumped over it, it would have been strangely fitting. The story got better again once that was finished, but the damage was done. Also, admittedly, my eyes kind of glazed past most of the action scenes past the halfway point. There were too many of them and not enough were plot-important enough to justify their existence. 

  Still, I really did like Worm, for many reasons already articulated in this thread! If I had to pick between reading PGtE for the first time or Worm for a second, I'd go with Worm.

    Haha, I'm a fan of elaborate settings with pages of detailed exposition, yet I also have grown to dislike PGtE!

    It's interesting, because the story overflows with hyper-focused details on how the empire is run, the structures of principalities, etc...yet the whole 4th-wall, genre-following/bending/breaking system upon which the world is built, is *extremely* ill-defined, and so much of the power interaction/development feels pulled from thin air and then rationalized after the fact.

    The author gives us an overflow of information for one major part of the story, but very little for another major part, and I think it ends up pushing out both categories of fans.

  Crapsack worlds generally don't appeal to me. The logistics of throwing thousands of people into the meat grinder while having whole societies somehow continue to function is a bit difficult to swallow. We see the people getting wiped out by immense powers but we don't always see the babies being born and grown to sustain the destruction. The glass is often too empty to seem rational.

  However I enjoyed Worm and PGTE. Worm manages the post-endbringer struggle of Brockton Bay with some semblance of balance up to a point. PGTE's good versus evil motif seems less developed what with the artificial famines and mass ritual massacres on the evil side and the good suffering from near constant depredations. 

  I suppose I like these stories because it helps that the protagonists are more ably depicted as damaged (yet functioning) products of their respective worlds. They become what they oppose. That's not conducive to forming an emotional attachment with the reader though. Bad things are expected to happen to the protagonists and I often concede they were deserved or shrug it off cuz shit happens in a crapsack world. I don't always empathize or make myself feel shock for their circumstances.
  ```

- u/Slinkinator:
  ```
  I have lots of thoughts on why, but I felt like if I put them out here initially it might stymy any feedback.  People talk about Worm's emphasis on practical heroism, practical application of powers, stuff like that.

  But I don't see it. What I see is extended middle school interactions between highly similar characters with cosmetic differences in place of real divergence.  Repeatedly the Undersider members express or come to a resolution to do what needs to be done, but insist on either inefficient or erratic behaviour, justified by the moral compunctions they just foreswore, or by the adolescent and basically uninteresting extended arguments they get into.

  A practical guide to evil seems to suffer from the same thing shadows of the limelight does, recursive narrative dependent worlds that lose sight of character development (here I am referring to both of them running into the same issue, creating world's where power is dependent on being genre savvy, and then having your characters do stuff like debate what will be genre savvy before they act).  Sometimes it introduces new characters that are superficially distinct from the people we've seen so far (I'm thinking of the Tyrant), but it seems like every auxiliary character checks their actions and decptions against what the protagonist can deal with.  Also there's really no evil to speak of, just modes of management with varying levels of effectiveness.

  It's been a month or so since I read either of them, and my once cogent criticisms may have withered, but this is the gist of my issue with these guys.

    I had somewhat the opposite reaction to Worm. Notwithstanding the high school bullying scenes, which really dragged, the beginning was my favorite part, and I had more complaints as the story progressed. I still liked it, overall, but don't plan to read it again until it's edited, and I'm really hoping that the things I most disliked get edited away (and Wildbow has already said as much when discussing the edits).

  I finally gave up shortly after the Leviathan fight. Now that I have enjoyed a lot of worm fanfiction I might try again. I’ve been on the fence pretty much from the first chapter on, though, and I think many of my complaints are still valid, even after reading spoilers that might explain them in-universe.

  Please note that the following is based on recollections from years ago. It summarizes my impression, nothing more.

  ---
  Every single fight I can remember felt incredibly narratively convenient to me, to the point of being unbelievable. It started with Lung. Taylor managed to narrowly avoid an experienced superhuman melee-fighter a few too many times for me to really be invested in the fight. Even after he grew too much for the pepper spray and bug-bites to really affect him, he just stumbled around. This started my belief that Taylor has plot-armor, which solidified throughout the next few arcs. In turn, this lowered my emotional investment significantly. I semi-fondly recall playing the yackety sax theme in my head while Bakuda and her goons chase the Undersiders with machine-guns and grenade launchers. Not really what imagine wildbow was going for.

  Barely succeeding against impossible odds once is exciting. Doing it routinely is boring.

  ---

  At the same time, Taylors life was designed to be as soul-crushing as possible. So many things happened *just so* in order for her life to suck, that I didn’t even care anymore. After having read some spoilers, I’m convinced Taylor’s life has been a Simurgh plot to get her in the right mindset for killing Scion by thinking depressing thoughts at him. (That’s roughly what happened, right?)

  ---
  The setting was vaguely unbelievable. This is later revealed to have been engineered by Cauldron, but Contessa inducing world-wide learned helplessness in regards to snipers vs. parahumans  does not make a compelling setting. This is mostly a number of miniscule subjective things that vaguely irritated me in the background. The one thing that bothered my had been that mundane humans were completely side-lined when parahumans were involved.

  ---

  For me to enjoy grimdark settings I have to either take the seriously, or laugh at it. I could do neither fully here.

  ---

  Tl;dr: Worm felt like each action had two possible outcomes: 1) Failing as inconveniently as possible; 2) Barely succeeding against all odds.

  I could only read Worm once, because the main appeal of the story is seeing how powers interact. If you’re not into that, the story isn’t actually that special.

  I’m also frosty on a Practical Guide to Evil. This is more because the update time is so long, but more than that the main characters are simply too cavalier for me. It never feels like bad shit will ever stick, which drains tension from it like a *motherfucker*.

  If you’re looking for something else, the Legacy series of FanFiction for Worm is much more character driven, in many ways surpassing the source material. Or you could read The Metropolitan Man for the fifth time.

  I can't speak for A Practical Guide to Evil, but a big part of Worm is that the protagonist is biased and is not socially healthy. It's considered rational because the world-building is a more realistic look at superhero tropes and how they might come about, things don't happen for no reason, and the characters all make sense as people and do their best to solve problems like an intelligent person. But if you compare it to explicitly rational fiction, there's a big lack of scientific methodology and it doesn't do a good job of teaching rationalism, not to mention how the main character is clearly biased against authority. So you can definitely make a case for it not being rational; something being compelling is more a personal thing, and without knowing more about your tastes we can't really guess why. It also might help to know where you stopped reading, because there *is* a quality drop later that a lot of people stopped at.



  TLDR: Don't look at Worm as a rational fic, I would say that it isn't. It's a constant roller-coaster with no brakes, some people just don't like that.

  I read a good chunk of Worm, probably over half. It wasn't *bad*, it explored a superhero world with some depth to it. But it didn't wow me, and eventually the grimdark level exceeded my tolerances (specifically, [when](#s " Bonesaw redecorated a room with Brian")).

  It has explorations of interesting concepts. But I don't see what I can learn for my own life [from](#s " puppeting someone's body as a torture method, or getting a child addicted to hard drugs so you have control of her powers, or assaulting a city to blackmail its inhabitants into handing someone over for the mother of all hazing rituals") except "don't do that."

  As a "world of superheroes" story, I prefer Doc Future. It really tries to tackle the question of "Why wouldn't this person use X power to do Y?" and IMO it does a good job.

  Speaking as someone who's a fan of Worm but ranges from to okay with to actively annoyed by Practical Guide I feel that both these stories have a common surface throughline but are highly divergent on a deeper level.

  Both of them work very well as power fantasies. You have moderately clever young protagonists with a ruthless streak getting into fights with people who generally represent some ideology the reader is led to find either ineffectual and distateful and coming out on top because they're harder and smarter. Fights are constructed to feel like they have a layer of mechanics to them that the characters can exploit so they seem smarter and more calculating than they are. These are stories that are very good at getting an audience of disaffected and often geeky young people to root for the protagonist.

  But on the deeper level things diverge. Worm is at it's core a character journey from the perspective of someone who is highly intelligent but weighed down by trauma and a biased perspective. She sees problems as simpler as they really are, and favours simple, violent solutions, but the world fails to bend to her expectations. Things are not that simple, the people she fights are people, and her violence and lone wolf attitude hurt herself as much as her enemies and don't do much good in the end. At the end of the day Worm is self aware of the fact that it's a power fantasy and delivers a story in which acting on the power fantasy only makes thing worse.

  Practical Guide, by contrast, is much simpler and shallower. The authoritarian power fantasy is accepted as a truly effective way of dealing with the world. Catherine is on surface level has just as much depth as Taylor but her conception of the world as a place where might makes right solutions and hard man decisions can fix the world is validated. She solves all her problems with over the top violence and domination and things just kinda... work out for her and she doesn't have to deal with the negative consequences for those decisions. 

  Conflicts are far less ambiguous as well. Catherine always has a clear idea of who her friends and enemies are, people within her monkeysphere are deliberately written to be more likeable and three dimensional than those who are not, her adversaries are often either much worse or much less likeable and unlike Taylor for whom the less savoury aspects of her friends is a source of internal conflict Catherine just accepts them for the most part unless it directly affects her. 

  It also hides it's lack of moral introspection by clothing itself in deconstruction of stock fantasy, which seems impressive to people who see fantasy in terms of tropes and cliches and have more limited reference pools, but falls flat to people who have a deeper, more varied, and more literary understanding of the genre.

  The messy part of it is that on a writing level Practical Guide is the more tightly written and effective story compared to Worm which is very uneven in it's pacing and storytelling. To sum up, I think that Worm is a story that's compelling because it indulges in the power fantasies people crave while at the same time examining them, whereas Practical guide is enjoyable to people because it distills the elements that make Worm appealing and gets rid of the parts that make Worm less comforting to the reader.
