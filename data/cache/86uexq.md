  Well that's not ominous at all.

      Yeah, and especially salty at the gods for abandoning them.  They'd never make a deal with the dragon, in that case

  Two things struck me while thinking about this post:

  * I've previously been under the impression the natives of Altazia were like the equivalents of native tribes in the Americas who'd been conquered by European settlers. But while some aspects of the two seems similar (e.g. the indication of a tribal social structures), the mentioning of priesthood (and remembering that there are Altazian (surface) natives besides the shifters, the Khusky) seems to indicate that Altazian and Ikosion societies weren't that different aside from the race of the constituent people, and probably the exact gods they chiefly worshipped.
  * And that in turn made me realize that I kept thinking the BC ("Before Cataclysm") era of MoL universe is equivalent to earth's Before Christ era. Instead, the impression I'm getting here of the way priests are portrayed is that they're more similar to the Catholic church of the Middle Ages (specifically, universal access to divine healing and being the local power) than what I know of the polytheistic worship of Greek/Roman religions (where anyone can commune with a god anywhere and where, in stories, supernatural power just means it's a gift/curse of one god or another).

  Just goes to show me for making assumptions, I guess. Pretty enlightening.

  *(...) allowing them to observe the process by which souls are created in developing children.*

  This does seem like the base for creating the mysterious power source, that we heard about repeatedly? The one that powers the orb, and Silverlake's heavy wards ...
