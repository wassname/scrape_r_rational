## Mother of Learning Finale Party

### Post:

It's a lot harder to create discussions around a story after it finishes so I think this is the best time to gather around and reminisce. And after 5 years of following this story on a monthly basis, I think the MoL deserves a celebratory mega discussion, about the ending, our favorite scenes, characters, expectations, theories, comments, etc.

To me, this ending fits very well with the theme of the story. >!I thought Zorian would die and turn into a lich, especially since all his power and knowledge would make him into a very worthy undead immortal.!<

>!I only wished to see more of the classmates and teachers in action during this battle, so we can get some of that delicious reaction. Alongside that, the author could have included a segment with Taramatula estate battle with the Ikosian forces. !<

Overall, it's a great story. I'll miss waiting for future chaps after the epilogue. What do you guys think?

  I kind of want to see government reactions to Zorian. While he never has really had political aspirations, he's the best human mind mage who can bypass Mind Blank, connections to the psychic spiders living under Cyoria, the fancy teleportation grid thing, and the ability to do all of this and be at multiple places at the same time. People trying to fit him into their political calculus are going to be having a nightmare.

        One bit that really stuck with me was how Goblins saw her. After picking up their body language and basically way of being by spending just so much time with 'em, she just hissed through her teeth (which doesn't really work with human cowteeth) and one of her Gob legionnaires just stares dumbfounded at her like they're seeing a purple dog, or a Human Matriarch

    I think the epilogue will focus a portion on this issue. The Eldemarian government had a major city destroyed, and a few of their Eagle Riders maimed by super powered beings out of nowhere. It's a pr disaster.

    I always looked down on the Eagle Riders, and didn't realize they were strong enough to fight against Oganj for a few minutes. The last time they were in the story, they got their asses kicked easily when QI and Z&Z were fighting in that field.

      It was by the Exiles, though, who are sort of a wild card when it comes to politics, and they can presumably get some great PR back by smashing the exiles, and helping The Isle would be bad optics for any of the other Splinters.

        Yeah, but Princess wasn't in it, she was finishing off one of Oganj's apprentices in the forest around the mansion before it was teleported. Zorian bound her to himself so she should still be loyal to him.
        ```

        - u/Nimelennar:
          ```
          Did Zorian bind her to himself, or is she bound to the divine dagger they found inside the Orb?

          - u/ICantGiveLessOfAFuck:
            ```
            I don't know if that would cause her to revert back to being uncontrolled, but I'm going to guess that she's still loyal to Zorian, if only for the hilarity factor and zoning issues of housing a massive, multi headed, murderous monstrosity.
            ```

  - u/PhilanthropAtheist:

    I would like to add that we still don't know what's contained in the sealed document Zorian gave Haslush. Hopefully it will be like how Rorschach from watch men wrote a diary of his findings.

        They have to be able. Otherwise Zach can't get out of the loop without dying, as Zorian clearly knows. But we know RR felt the deal just disappear without a fanfare.

  I kinda liked the Zach (I Win) chapter. He did kinda broke down after feeling such remorse in losing Zorian. I know Zorian can be a jerk but it was the only way for Zach to be saved. You can kinda see how Zorian was trying to lighten Zach's mood by the end when there was someone who asked Zach if he was okay at the hill and showing some fireworks for celebration.

      Vampire girl was an underling of Quatach Ichl early in the story (Ch 26). She was the scion of some noble vamp clan on Ulquaan Ibasa. Author has stated elsewhere that she was supposed to be a lead in for Zorian to explore Ulquaan Ibasa during the second arc, but the thread got dropped because of time/pacing.

  >I only wished to see more of the classmates and teachers in action during this battle, so we can get some of that delicious reaction. Alongside that, the author could have included a segment with Taramatula estate battle with the Ikosian forces.

  While I'm not disappointed in what we got, I definitely agree that the different parts of the battle could easily have been dragged out into 3 more chapters following many more of the many characters and factions introduced throughout the book. I wonder if we'll get a lot of that in the epilogue. Ultimately though the story is about Zorian, so his bits were the parts I wanted, and we got that.
  ```

  - u/PhilanthropAtheist:
    ```
    Nobody103 hasn't really been big on writing perspectives outside Zorian's. If you've noticed, even Zach and Red Robe's perspective had been under the influence of Zorian's mind magic. So I dont think we'll find out much about the others.

    I myself am disappointed on not knowing how Zach got the crown the first time.
    ```

    - u/domoincarn8:
      ```
      Red Robe begged QI for it.
      ```

      - u/RuggedTracker:
        ```
        Red Robe wouldn't be part of the time loop at that point. How would he convince QI to give it?
        ```

        - u/domoincarn8:
          ```
          He was aware of the time loop because Zach was careless and was telling everyone that he was a time traveller. Plus Zach by that point had worked with him over multiple restarts to get his legal documents done and that had tipped off Jornak that he was actually a time traveller because those documents were not easy to find.

          Plus Zach didn't take precautions like Zorian did with Alanic.

          Plus QI didn't need to give it, just have a spell performed while in his presence.
          ```

  I love that grey hunter so much
  ```

- u/cysghost:

  It’s finished? I’ll start it now. Been waiting on it to be completed before I started. I’ll avoid the rest of the discussion for fear of spoilers though.

- u/1000dollarsamonth:

  I just always thought that Red Robe was Fortov and the author even teased before the big battle that he never saw Red Robe's face so there was a chance it was not Jornak. Did Zorian even sent his simulcarum to keep Fortov safe? Probably not.
  ```

  - u/UnsuspiciousGuy:
    ```
    Fortov didn't even get a cameo in the latest chaps, he's been forgotten. Since they didn't interact as much even in the loop, I think Zorian would prefer not to interact with his brother anyway.
    ```

- u/Kehwar:
  ```
  Was the Imperial Orb used in some specific way? (beside being a convenient storage item)

  Since he mentioned to Daimen he needed it, I assumed it tied to some part of their plans
  ```

  - u/theRandomTiger:
    ```
    It was probably used as transport. I do think he pulled the Grey Hunter “pokeball” out of it, and probably carried his golems and Princess in it. I don’t think the Imperial Orb can do anything else outside the time loop
    ```

- u/UnsuspiciousGuy:
  ```
  One idea I've wonder why it wasn't implemented was: Why didn't the simulacrums wear the golems like ironman armor? Now you've got a sentiment machine with mind control powers. That really was a missed opportunity.
  ```

  - u/steelong:
    ```
    Didn't he mention giving having his simulacra basically possess golem bodies?  That seems much more efficient than making a hollow golem controlled from the inside by a normal golem.

    I had just assumed that any time Zorian mentioned his simulacra in the final chapters, they were his golem-simulacra hybrids.
    ```

    - u/JiggyRobot:
      ```
      Didnt the simulacrum still look human on the outside though? I assumed it was a terminator type thing, so that externally they looked human but were more solid inside. That way there is still a layer of squishiness.

      Presumably if that was the case, it's going to limit their capabilities a lot. Battle golem wise
      ```

  - u/Nimelennar:
    ```
    The simulacra *are* golems.  He stopped making them out of ectoplasm a really long time ago.

    I agree Zorian probably could have enhanced them further than what he did, but there's no reason why he'd make them wear Iron Man armour when he could just as easily make them into, basically, Ultron bodies, and discard all of the squishy, vulnerable bits.
    ```

  - u/Luck732:
    ```
    Nobody103 has talked about this.  Basically, putting a soft fleshy body inside of a golem just removes some of the best parts of golems, namely that they can survive pieces of their bodies being blown out.

    As far as the simulacra go, they are actually built around golem bodies, its what make them more efficient and durable.  Nothing as crazy as Mrva, but Mrva has a different precious cargo to hold on to.
    ```

  - u/VorpalAuroch:
    ```
    I got the impression that the core of a golem needed to hold the insanely complicated spell core that 'programmed' it, and therefore couldn't fit a person inside without significant loss of capability.
    ```

    - u/UnsuspiciousGuy:
      ```
      I was thinking the Simulacrum plasma body could morph into a liquid/gaseous state since he deformed his body when he was talking to the detective in the tavern. 

      Creating the core would be a lot tougher, but he could do something similiar like the Iasku Mansion soul. The necromancer dude used his wife's soul as the controller for the mansion, which Zorian could do something similar like that.
      ```

      - u/VorpalAuroch:
        ```
        I think it would be pretty awkward and not actually that big of a benefit.
        ```
