  I'm not familiar with the abbreviation - what does "SI" stand for?

  EDIT: Oh. I knew the term, but not the abbreviation for it. All that was coming to mind was "Singularity Intelligence", "Systeme International", and "self-injury", none of which seemed to fit. Thanks!

    Self-insert. As far as I'm aware, it's gone from meaning a *literal* self-insert into a fictional setting, though it certainly can be, to imply something more like portal fantasy that happens to be fanfiction.

      >it's gone from meaning a literal self-insert into a fictional setting,

      Usually I see "SI" to mean a traditional self insert, with "SI OC" meaning a non-author (but otherwise "regular") person inserted into a story.
      ```

        Not quite. The OC part of SI OC does stand for original character, but generally it just means that the author has inserted themselves into a character that wasn't originally in the setting.
        ```

      I personally would prefer for SI to mean both, does this work?

      SI=author as character is in the fiction

    "Self Insert"

  I'm not really into comics, but I read this anyway for some reason and it was pretty good.  Thanks for sharing.

  Fun start, but the in-progress mark comes before anything really interesting has happened. Better to leave it alone and come back if / when it's a decent length.
  ```
