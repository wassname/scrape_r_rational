  Despite what appears to be a majority opinion that chapters like this make the story too slow, these world building chapters are inevitably my favorite. This is in large part because they are always carefully constructed to support jokes and clever connections in addition to interesting worldbuilding. Today's installment was no exception. I hope to see many more in the future.

    Scott referred to this as a dull expository chapter, but I have no idea how.  This is one of the tensest and most stunning chapters of the story so far.

      This wasn't the chapter I was originally planning to post today, but since I was in California and seeing a lot of Unsong readers I figured I should give them something interesting so we could have something to talk about.

      You'll get your regular dose of dull exposition back next week.

      This is an expository chapter but it's in the upper percentage of interesting expository chapters, IMO.

    Yeah, this is probably my favourite chapter so far. Unsong's world is so utterly, wonderfully original.

    I agree, but only with the caveat that the main plot ends up having enough content once it really gets going. It'd be a shame to build this huge world and then have Aaron and Ana's adventure in it only be the length of a novella.
    ```

    - u/over_who:

      Honestly, while I enjoy the main plot, if the entire story was witty vignettes similar to this chapter, with only minor plot continuity and fun character development, I don't know how much I'd mind.

    I definitely haven't seen any indication on this subreddit that that's the majority opinion. I remember one discussion on the comment threads regarding people's preference for advancing the plot versus the sidestory-esque chapters but there was no clear majority.

  And now *that* is the real reason why the theonomic corporations don't sell the Fertile Name to Ethiopia in order to cure hunger. The Ethiopians don't have souls, so they can't use Names!
  ```

  - u/___ratanon___:
    ```
    They could write the Name on a piece of paper, which Ethiopians would then tear up. [That should work.](/r/unsong/comments/4h7hcp/names/d2q5hnj)
    ```

    - u/electrace:
      ```
      Unless tearing it up only works if you have a soul.

      Plus, there's no reason to give them the name in the first place; they aren't actually experiencing any suffering due to the lack of souls in this story, so there's no moral imperative to make sure that they don't starve.

        If it's easy to do, though, it would still be good for public opinion.

  He Uriel, just wanted to let you know that apart from the tragedy that followed your joke was hilarious.

    What's a couple of million lives for a good joke

    - u/SvalbardCaretaker:
      ```
      At least 20 or so of them didnt have souls, so its fine.
      ```

    Best knock knock joke ever

  From what Uriel says, it's basically impossible (for normal humans) to distinguish a person from a p-zombie. Other than, maybe, if they use a Name and it doesn't work. And according to Uriel, such a p-zombie would emphatically insist on having a soul and even exhibit existential dread at finding out otherwise, but not actually be conscious.

  *shudder*

  Should p-zombies have human rights? Assuming that you can experimentally verify somebody not having a soul, and you have an archangel's word for them not having conscious experience but being complex automatons, should you value them the same as a human with a soul? How would this affect the Trolley Problem?

  *more shudder*
  ```

  - u/appropriate-username:
    ```
    Even within the context and world of that story, I don't see what the point is of placing such a huge value on a soul that it would distinguish those who have rights from those that don't while having almost completely no influence on the human.

        (Good) moral philosophy is an attempt to describe the internal preference function and does not respond to external evidence. Either souls are necessary in order to morally matter, or souls aren't necessarily in order to matter. Whether or not souls exist is irrelevant to moral philosophy -  if they don't exist and you believe they are necessary than you have to admit you live in an empty world. If they do exist and you believe they aren't necessarily before, learning of their existence doesn't change anything.
        ```

    - u/Darth_Hobbes:
      ```
      In the context of the story, it's clear that Uriel operates on a level that is actualy beyond human comprehension. He's essentially the only person on the planet qualified to speak on the matter, so his word can be taken as the next best thing to the word of god. So if Uriel says that consciousness is non-material and certain people aren't actually conscious and have no moral value, that deserves some serious consideration whether it fits with our understanding of neuroscience or not.

      Or perhaps more credibly, if Thamiel lacks any desire to torture p-zombies then that's some damn good evidence p-zombies don't have any genuince capacity for suffering. Of course, that's if Thamiel isn't just acting that way to inflame racism.
      ```

      - u/creatureofthewood:

        I think a more sensible interpretation is that the angelic utility function treats souls differently from the human one, at least that is how angels think before angels acquire whatever cynical knowledge causes them to become fallen angels (which, note, Uriel is not as yet). 

        Thamiel's utility function is inverse of the angelic ones, so his not caring about souls means either he really doesn't care about the soulless just as angels don't, or he too doesn't realize the philosophical issue. 

        The human response to this would be to remove their souls so Thamiel doesn't take them (although it then turns into Thamiel's interest to take them regardless for game theory reasons)
        ```

      - u/Bowbreaker:
        ```
        Wasn't every human essentially soulless up till the crystal sphere got cracked? Or did I misunderstand that?
        ```

        - u/bassicallyboss:
          ```
          As I understand it, humans had souls, but the divine light entering the world was blocked off.  So humans pre-crack had some of the current benefits of having a soul (e.g., conscious experience, afterlife) but not anything that required divine light to work properly (e.g., the use of Names).
          ```

  - u/CreationBlues:
    ```
    Actually, I think this whole p-zombie thing is entirely missing the point. in my opinion, souls and consciousness are orthogonal qualities: someone can have a soul and not be conscious, and someone can have no soul and be conscious. This is based on the fact that a soul is completely optional, and whether you have one can change over your lifetime, apparently with no observable side effects.

    I think that having a soul is sort of like having the right to vote. You still exist independent of your rights, but when you have them the world tends to work differently for you. In this case, having a soul lets you use names, let's you move on to heaven or hell, and plugs you in to the api holy beings like angels and Uriel have access to, which tracks suffering, happyness, sin, etc.

    It has to be emphasized that you exist independently of this system. Even if it does noticeably change your behavior, it would just be added to a massive list of environmental variables that control you, including things like sun exposure, air quality, exposure to nature in your enviroment, trace minerals such as lithium or lead in your enviroment, smog, pollution, food quality, etc etc etc etc.

  Given the realities of the afterlife in Unsong, not having a soul might be a good thing.

    Optimal? If nothing else he could surely have done so in a way that improved his PR, whereas this will hurt it.
    ```

- u/scruiser:
  ```
  So how much was Uriel just reacting emotionally, and how much of that was a calculated attempt to stop Thamiel from achieving his goals in a brute force fashion/prevent knowledge that North Africa doesn't have souls from spreading?
  ```

- u/Kawoomba:
  ```
  Interestingly, while this chapter seems to be amongst the more controversial to date, it's also been my favorite.

  You managed to make me laugh at the instant death of a whole city, this is why I continue loving this story
