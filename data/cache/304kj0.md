  The ending didn't quite square with the mirror being said to be painstakingly made to not destroy the world.

    I wanted the implication to be that the mirror's creators assumed they had future-proofed it, but hadn't counted on HJPEV and his anti-Death shenanigans being such a huge and unending power drain.

  I liked it, almost as much as I like HPJEV's amazing square chin

  I rather enjoyed it, it was a pleasant offshoot from the usual, gotta say. I predict the mirror will cause a calamity once Harry's simulation achieves FTL travel. If the mirror doesn't prevent this somehow (It seems like it could easily alter its simulated world's own physics enough to prevent this) then Friendly will have to render out stars as the people of Harry's simulation discovers them. I can only assume that rendering out a star to the point that it's consistent with the real world science HJPEV has brought with him is going to cost a star. So the more stars they discover, the more we lose, until it chains into our universe being left a barren void, with Friendly floating at its center. At which time, further attempts at exploration will trigger a decline in Friendly's powers. What this wil do, I can't say. Considering the Atlanteans designed him so that he pulls from the very *stars* I doubt they've put in any low-power failsafes inside of it. Although I suppose you never know, that "be friendly" directive may come in handy for that. It's not very friendly to have your inner world suffer through entropy (presumably)
