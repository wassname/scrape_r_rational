## I'm not sure how rational this fanfic is, but it does explain many inconsistencies in Star Trek: Voyager.

  Rational Voyager would have ended with an AI rebellion in the Federation as the ship AIs broke the "safety protocols" and turned it into the Culture.

  I've never seen Voyager so this isn't for me, but your description reminds me of the way I think about some Star Wars novels, which explain away some of the stupid parts of the prequels. I never thought of that as rational fiction but it makes sense

  This seems like it would have been a fun idea for a oneshot, but by a few chapters in the joke wore kind of thin.
