  ```
  Even if from the first instant the entire history of the universe could be perfectly mapped, we still make decisions.  
  The alternative to determinism is what, they we aren't in control of our own decisions? That even though we think we have made decisions based on our mental state interacting with every other element of causality, we're actually some non-deterministic function that isn't part of the cause-and-effect relationship that governs everything we perceive?  


  I'm not sure if I'm expressing my disagreement with the notion that determination and free will are in any way exclusive, I firmly believe that free will can't exist if we are not deterministic.  To me a non-deterministic universe is one where cause and effect are completely unrelated to each other, and shit just happens sometimes.  The idea seems meaningless to me, and that we would exist more as passing hallucinations than anything else, with no will at all and nothing to grip with it.
