## [D] Friday Open Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could (possibly) be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.

  So, mostly trolling, but despite the whole thing being mindless happy fluff and nearly all the side characters holding giant idiot balls nearly all the time... I hereby declare this season's "Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle" anime is, in fact, rational fiction. 

  Hear me out:

  * MC makes full use of her (initially few) abilities and inherent properties of the world, up to and including death not being permanent, to experiment with and learn about her environment and expand her options

  * Although MC is not very knowledgeable, and some "facts" others have taught her are blatantly incorrect, she tests her knowledge and learns from her tests

  * MC has goals which, although not aligned with commonly accepted human morality, are consistent and well defined

  * MC directly, ruthlessly, relentlessly exploits all objects and sentients in her environment and properties of it to achieve her goals

  I'm taking a leave of absence from school until classes are in-person again. I spent the 7 years before law school working remotely, and a big part of the reason that I went back to school was for the human interaction. Zoom classes are both significantly lower quality and completely fail to satisfy the human interaction component that I desired.

  There are plenty of logical reasons to take a leave of absence, and I'll be working on a really interesting startup during my leave -- but it still feels a bit like I'm wimping out/giving up. This pandemic sucks.

    I'm about to start grad school in January and wish I could defer for another semester, but I have $3,000 in non-refundable tuition deposits and $60k in grants saying no. I'm hoping to milk every last util out of online classes in the spring, and that vaccines will roll out fast enough that I can be on campus with some semblance of normalcy in fall '21. 

    Glad you figured out an alternative, and I hope you get back to school sooner than later.

    This pandemic does suck. I'm now recognizing that I was way too emotionally biased against the idea of taking a gap year between high school and college. If I could do this year over again, I'd defer enrollment.

There’s something there. Maybe I’m just an ugly and broken enough world, what with dinosaur digestive issues and all, that I deserve K-T extinction events.

  I [graduated last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/jycuyj/received_these_emails_backtoback_this_week_no/) and will be starting my first "almost-real big-boy" job next Tuesday! Have a good few projects to choose from, none of which I'm really familiar with, so lots of learning & exciting times ahead. Does anyone here have any hot beginner tips & tricks for new postdocs? Also, if anyone here's a programmer or data scientist -- those are my main fallbacks in case academia doesn't work out -- so I'd be keen to hear how best to make myself more attractive to those industries these next 1-3y (anthropology grad... [more details here](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/k08ei9/recent_anthropology_grad_w_little_formal/)).

  Otherwise, today is Black Friday, which despite its US origins has become something of an international holiday. Are you buying anything? I made a list of things I'd like to get in case there are any good sales:

  * a lightweight, portable laptop, ideally <14" w/ non-soldered storage and memory, with 8c/16t, able to dual boot into windows / linux (i.e. good driver support), or maybe a macbook pro

  * a graphics card capable of gaming at 4K/60Hz on "high" settings in recent titles, with freesync support, and also decent at graphical computing in a pinch -- maybe a used Turing or an in-stock Big Navi / Ampere

  * a tablet to read articles / books on, maybe the 4th gen 13" iPad Pro, or one of the 13" e-ink screens 

  * a telephoto zoom lens for my camera -- the Sigma 100-400mm E-mount being my top desire atm

  * a decent road bike, to upgrade my 7 year old $150 hybrid for commuting

  * moar weights (both DBs and Plates) and an incline bench, for lifting purposes with gyms closed in the indefinite near-term

  Probably not gonna get all of those this year even, but keeping my eye out for deals (mostly through the weekend -- going hiking in a low-service area today) and trying not to get too much random shit (which I've already failed, having bought a bunch of whey and a Kindle Oasis, the latter of which will mostly get used for reading stuff off here). Anyone here looking for anything in particular?

    Unless you're apathetic towards cost, I would avoid the Macbook Pro. You should be able to save at least a thousand dollars getting a comparable or near-comparable Windows/Linux laptop.
