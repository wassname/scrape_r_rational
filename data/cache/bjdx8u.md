## Is there anything remotely close to what the Atlantis Story Arc would have looked like from a rational standpoint which was never completed in HpMor?

### Post:

I'm looking for a ratfic based on Atlantis. It could have aimed to complete HpMor's Atlantis Arc, or have a completely different standalone storyline.

I have this mild OCD that makes my brain itch thinking about incomplete structures. So, I guess I'm kind of trying to placate that.

All recommendations are welcome. Thanks.

:D

  I think the talk of Atlanta in hpmor is inspired by (or even a reference to) another fanfic. I think "Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time". I had read it a little before I read hpmor because it's in Yudkowskys favorites list. I don't thinking that fic is especially rational, though. And I think it's not finished.

    >Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time

    It's complete actually. It's been complete since 2010. You might be thinking of Harry Potter and the Heartlands of Time which is the sequel and was completed just last year (it took 8 years to be finished).

      There's two?! The more, the merrier.

      Thanks a lot, my kind sire.

      I wonder if this bot works in this sub?

    It's not rational, but it does have the satisfying catchphrase "Because I'm Harry *fucking* Potter", by a genuinely dangerous incarnation of the character.  After the waffley disarm-spamming of canon, it was a pleasant change.

      What's a waffley disarm-spamming?
      ```

      - u/Iconochasm:
        ```
        "Hi, I'm Harry Potter.  At this moment, I'm being chased by genocidal terrorists who are actively trying to kill me and all my friends.  I know!  I'll use a spell that temporarily disarms them, assuming no one has a backup wand, or could ever recover their own!  Brilliant tactics!"

        Like, I get he's the good guy, and a kid, but *damn*, break a couple fingers or *something*.

  Sam Hughes' [ra](https://qntm.org/ra) could scratch a similar itch. It's not HP, and the magic system is pretty different, but >!the logic and origin of the magic system are explored and explained!<.

  Not an exact match but if you are looking for a continuation there is Following the Phoenix which is a continuation of hpmor from chapter 81. It doesnâ€™t feature Atlantis itself but closes off part of the story arc in a way.

  There is also significant digits which is another continuation of hpmor.

    I've read Significant Digits and Orders of Magnitude.

    I'll catch up on the Following the Phoenix too.

    Thanks a lot for the suggestion, mate.

    :D
