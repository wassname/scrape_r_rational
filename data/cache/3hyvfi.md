  Would you mind giving a quick summary of why you liked this, and what about it you think makes it appeal to /r/rational readers?

      Thanks for the summary. That sounds interesting, I might check it out.

      What do you mean by attaching a description? This is a link submission, so you can't add text to it beyond the title. The general convention seems to be to add any extra information in a top level comment after posting. Possibly you wrote a description in the text tab of the submissions page?

        Looking at other posts, I think you're right. My mistake.
