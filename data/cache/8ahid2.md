### Post:

I read a story Ã  couple months ago about two heroes summoned into a universe with a coherent magic system. One of the summoned goes about deconstructing magic and using the scientific method to reinvent plumbing, power transmission, mining, and other such fun things.

Can anyone remind me the name?
