## Reporting a line that I liked (and seemed relevant) in Meiyaku no Leviathan:

### Post:

"Have you resolved yourself to coexist with the dragonslaying bow, to advance along the Road to Kingship?" 

"No, I've simply resolved myself to feign participation in that ridiculous game with the ostentatious name, meanwhile devoting myself to researching secret techniques and clever ways to exploit loopholes in the system."

(Meiyaku of the Covenant is a light novel series by the same author as the light novel series 'Campione!'; when I read it I get severe 'Campione!' déjà vu, but I'm still reading it in case the protagonist does something mentally impressive/interesting.)
