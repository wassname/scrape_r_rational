  A necromancer who works to end death? A noble goal and despicable, though rational, methods? A dozen knife's edge escapes requiring very careful and specific actions? Yes, please!

  Hard high fantasy in a Lovecraftian homage, set in the My Little Pony Friendship is Magic universe. As a fan of MLPFiM, I thoroughly enjoyed this epic adventure. As a potential fan of HP Lovecraft, this made me want to read the original works. As a fan of HPMOR, I found the dark lord's plotting and goals eerily reminiscent. Everything about this story, from the outside, says it shouldn't work, yet it works far better than I expected.

  The author's other MLP fanwork, *Mendacity*, is also an epic and fascinating read, meant more for fans of Celtic mythology and fantastic races.

  I don't see what is rational about this story. In fact, most love craft stories seem decidedly irrational. I'm 10 chapters in and the main focus has been not learning too much and forgetting g things when necessary, which seems like the opposite of what a rational protagonist would do.

    That's because the Mule is the audience viewpoint character, and Sassaflash isn't telling her side of things yet. It gets rational when they find the tomb. It gets downright sciency about magic after that, because she knows she needs help and allows the Mule to aid her beyond "move this" and "carry that". (She also gets smarter when she is forced to stop doping herself to dull the pain.)

    The forgetting is necessary to prevent apocalypse, as she makes perfectly clear. True, the Lovecraftian things are vast powers unbound by logic from outside spacetime materiality.  But in a world overshadowed by such hideous things, she's trying to save her race of sapient beings from their eventual extinction, and all its individuals from death, using the full breadth of her mind and all possible tools at her disposal, disregarding social mores and appropriateness. Totally a /r/Rational character.

  It's excellently written, with many twists and turns and some great yet believable characters. Highly recommended to cosmic horror fans, and to anyone who likes it when the protagonist is a villain plotting to take over the world. Knowledge of My Little Pony and the Cthulhu Mythos is not required, though each will add some context to the story if you do happen to know it.

  The story has some nice rational influences. The Dark Lord Sassaflash's plots make her almost a pony version of General Chaos, particularly when she overestimates herself. The MLP influence shines through, and in the end it's more optimistic than most stories you'll find on here. With a constant undercurrent of horror and tragedy that comes from the Lovecraft parts.
