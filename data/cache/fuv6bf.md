## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  There’s a new government that is responding to a supervillain that is able to magically, remotely monitor people’s emotional states and create terrorist disasters based on people experiencing strong negative emotions, by setting up a surveillance state of its own and criminalizing the kinds of emotions that can be weaponized. (Think if Japan charged everyone the Dark Kingdom used to fight Sailor Moon with terrorism after the fact). Everyone seems on board with their new surveillance state, which they see as their only protection from the supervillain.

  You’re an eighteen year old rationalist, who was secretly the hero in canon, but you currently have no superpowers or fame. You don’t trust the surveillance state, but you must not attract the attention of the supervillain, who you also want to defeat. How do you win the hearts and minds of the people (or at least make sure both of your enemies lose them)?

    > but you currently have no superpowers or fame.

    So... you are a completely normal person with no leverage whatsoever?

    Uh, stay in school, work hard, network, gain professional experience, get into politics in twenty years? Or whatever superior alternative the local version of [80k hours](https://80000hours.org/) suggests.

    I'm confused. If the supervillain's power is turning strong negative emotions into disasters, why doesn't the government just force feed everyone antidepressants and other drugs? That would be far more effective than surveillance, since plenty of people have strong negative emotions so they would need to deal with tons and tons of people, somehow. Anyone with depression, anyone who has had bad things happen to them recently, anyone who is unhappy with the government oppression, etc. 

    Even worse is how the government could deal with these people, because throwing them all in a prison is just asking for the supervillain to use the prisoner's combined negativity to make disasters. Is the government just killing them? Does the public have access to the surveillance system or any evidence that the killed people truly had strong negative emotions, or does the government just have a free pass to kill anyone they want without evidence?

    Also, how does anyone even know that the supervillain exists? His power is magical and remotely activated, so he never has to show his face or be anywhere near the attacked sites or hire any minions. It's like having a death note, almost total anonymity unless they goof up or do something stupid like publicly announcing their existence.

      Unless they have fictional mood-altering drugs that work much better than ones in reality (for example, soma in *Brave New World*), force-feeding them to people is unlikely to work. It's hard enough to get the right medication and dosage with a trained psychiatrist and a cooperative patient who *wants* the meds to work. And drug addiction tends to create, not prevent, strong negative emotions. Maybe force-fed drugs could stabilize someone's mood in an emergency, but doing that long-term will make things worse, not better.
      ```

    Is this for a grimdark Miraculous Ladybug fanfiction?

    Presumably since you have no superpowers your only option is to leverage your knowledge of the supervillain, which is that he can create terrorist disasters from negative emotions.

    So if you want to fight the government, you'd find a way to subvert their monitoring and then cause people near the government in key positions to have strong negative emotions and be turned into disasters by the villain.  Eg, do terrible things to the less protected loved ones of government officials.  

    It might put you on the supervillain's radar, but honestly as a normal person with no powers you don't have much to work with.

  Your body requires no food, drink, or sleep. Your body stays clean without needing to shower/bathe. You can slow down/stop hair growth in any part of your body. These powers can be selectively turned on and off at will.

  Obviously this gives you a lot more free time to exercise/study/work/fulfill your utility function, but are there any non-obvious ways to munchkin it?
  ```

  - u/Norseman2:
    ```
    This is an extreme option, but if you don't need food or water, then almost your entire digestive tract can be removed and the space can be made into storage for smuggling. You'd still need to retain enough of your GI tract to manage saliva, pancreatic enzymes, and bile, but that would still mean you could get rid of most of your large and small intestines, and the entirety of your stomach.

    If the 'clean' power can continuously clean off microbial growths, then you can just stick things directly into the cavity. If that doesn't work, then the alternative would be to get properly closed up after surgery but keep large skin flaps on either side of your abdomen. Then, you could place the objects for transport under your ribcage, and put a plastic/foam form guide in place to give your abdomen an approximately normal appearance and feel after you wrap the flaps over it. You could then glue the flaps down the middle and make it look like an old surgical scar.

    This could be used to conceal lockpicks, bump keys, digital media storage devices, a handgun, a diamond-tipped hand drill, etc., which could be exploited in a wide variety of ways. This method of concealment would defeat a strip search and a millimeter wave scanner, but not necessarily a metal detector. Obviously most typically smuggled goods wouldn't show up on a metal detector anyway, and for many of the items I listed, it is possible to buy or make ceramic/plastic/composite variants which also would not set off a metal detector. An X-ray would still detect all of this, but that's obviously much less common as a security screening measure, so this approach would allow for smuggling a surprisingly wide range of items through a large majority of security checkpoints.

    What happens if I lose blood? Do I need to eat to restore the lost blood? If not, I am now generating blood from nothing. Same applies to hair.

    What does "clean" mean? Am I now the ultimate non-stick surface? What happens when I dive into mud? (presumably naked, since my clothing is probably not immune?)

    AFAIK, part of the normal healthy functioning of human skin involves the constant shedding of the dead outer layer of skin. How does that interact with either of the mentioned points?

      Your blood/hair regenerates at a level consistent with the average person's food intake, regardless of your actual food intake. Is there a way to leverage this into something useful that can't be done by a regular person?

      Any substance on your skin/hair that you would consider to be "unclean" is slowly converted to a gaseous form over the span of several hours
      ```

      - u/AlmostNeither:
        ```
        Converted to a gaseous form?  That sounds prettily useful if you can catalyze reactions that are normally difficult to accomplish.  Just find an appropriate material and mix it into yucky goop for careful synthesis of various things?
        ```

      - u/General__Obvious:
        ```
        You now have a mechanism by which entropy may be reversed - your hair and blood are regenerating *ex nihilo.*
        ```

        - u/TempAccountIgnorePls:
          ```
          I mean, sure, but it's in very small quantities with no way to ramp up production and will stop when you die. Not very useful
          ```

            ```
            Yeah, not enough for "become rich by putting a pipe in your aorta and selling mass quantities of blood and plasma", but even a little bit of matter ex nihilo is something.

            The obvious thing to do, at least to me, is to take this shocking new phenomenon to some physicists (and/or become one yourself), figure out where it comes from, and work your way up out of the simulation or whatever is going on.

            The only way I can really see a small amount of matter being particularly useful is on a spacecraft. If you can develop an energy source that feeds on those complex organics as fuel (lots of hydrogen in there, could plot-insert a fusion reactor) and ejects them really fast away from you, you could become the fastest thing in the galaxy. Everything else has to carry it's fuel along with it, and thus has a top speed.

              Haha but you're the person with the power, why would you go down the path that leads to China's Space Program turning your body into a matter factory?

        This sounds like it could kill you. All the dirt on your body turns into gas that you breathe in.

        What are the mind games you can play as the result of being visibly dirty somehow and then being clean without having any kind of cleansing activity? Can you destroy crime scene evidence? Can you mess with somebody about it?
        ```

      - u/IICVX:
        ```
        If you could convince your power that "your blood" has to contain something rare or valuable, maybe. 

        I mean it's gotta be able to account for the change in the the composition of your blood over time somehow (kid blood is not adult blood is not athlete blood), so by slowly and consistently introducing something into your bloodstream you might be able to have the power start creating it ex nihilo. Idk what it would be though. Nanomachines? Monopoles?
        ```

      - u/etiepe:
        ```
        What are the properties of that gas?
        ```

  - u/NestorDempster:

    You could call yourself "The Cavalry" and pretend that your power requires a heavy price to be paid, so they only get you out in case someone is trying to take over the world.

    As part of your backstory, you enter meditative stasis in the public yet nonetheless somewhat, but not extremely, well defended ~~Justice League~~ Altruistic Alliance headquarters, so people can observe that you're actually in stasis. Add twists as necessary to confuse higher level adversaries

    * Make it so that people can observe you at all times with a video feed.
    * The last time Bigba Adie and Baba Yaga were defeated, you played a crucial but undisclosed role in the defeat.
    * Maybe make your backstory nonobvious, or put it under one bit of obvious misdirection, and two other bits of slightly more sneaky misdirection.

    Thus, if someone is trying to take over the world, then the first thing they will do is to try to do is kill you. You thus act as a canary for the Masculine Mongoose to know when someone is trying to take over the world. You will lead a very boring life followed by a very interesting death.

    \[Feel free to use this idea for whatever.\]

    You could use it to power interstellar travel. Those long-haul flights would usually work via using a very small amount of fuel to very slowly accelerate the ship to near the speed of light. So, your production of saliva/blood/hair/whatever out of nothing could be used as the fuel for this, maybe.
    ```

  - u/EdenicFaithful:
    ```
    I'm not sure if you count these as obvious ways, but honestly the applications are probably too numerous.

    These powers make you into a super-soldier or -hunter, a near perfect explorer including over sea or desert, a great colonizer, and an ideal agitator against the state through lack of rootedness, what with the mobility and resilience involved. You're the perfect stowaway, infiltrator, you can starve enemies out, you can command without losing mental sharpness from a lack of food or rest that the enemy shares, etc.

    If hair can grow past normal limits, it might increase general adaptability. Defense against cold. Can you swim better based on length and pattern of body hair?
