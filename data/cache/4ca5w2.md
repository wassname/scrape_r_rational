  Are you only targeting existing readers with these announcements? 'ATSRTW'  does not at all provoke curiosity (this is a generic problem that all acronym-only titles have IMO).

  I'd suggest 'ATSRTWhirlwind', 'Reap the Whirlwind', or even just 'Whirlwind' as more interesting ways of writing the title.
