## [D] Request: Important Laws of Physics and What Happens When You Break Them

### Post:

I don't know physics as well as a lot of the other people here so I don't fully understand the consequences of changing the rules. Anything nonobvious is appreciated but I'm particularly interested in unexpected consequences of the following rules often broken by fiction:

1\. Conservation of Mass / Conservation of Energy

2\. Conservation of Momentum

3\. Privileged Reference Frames

4\. Locality

5\. The existence of differential equations describing the laws of physics

6\. High Kolmogorov Complexity Laws of Physics

7\. Infinite Speed of Light

8\. Discrete vs Continuous Matter / Time / Space

Links to pre-existing explanations already available elsewhere are sufficient.

      Very basically, conservation laws happen because of symmetries.

      Conservation of momentum is due to the fact that the physical laws of a system are independent of location for example. So if youre in a system without conservation of momentum this necessarily means that the physical laws vary with respect to space. So it might be easier to accelerate in certain places or directions for example, depending on how exactly momentum is not conserved.

      [EDIT] I should also mention that no privelidged reference frames is strongly related to these symmetries. A reference frame is simply the coordinates that our laws are written in, and the symmetries specify limits on the types of reference frames that are equivalent to each other. I.e. in special relativity, only non-accelerating (relative to each other) frames are OK. In general rel, accelerating frames *are* OK. Breaking symmetry limits the types of reference frames which are OK, if you break rotational symmetry, all frames must align with the great celestial pole or something like that.

  7 Infinite speed of light.
  This means that light cannot be a wave or a particle, it is a mathematical ray. So, none of electromagnetic theory works - no radio, relativity, QM, etc. Chemistry and electromagnetics may work, but they'd only be superficially similar, the equations would be different. Electrostatics and simple models of magnetism work without any changes.

  Infinite speed of light also means a privileged times reference. I.e. everyone anywhere moving at any speed can agree on whether two events happen at the same time or not (in theory). So Newtonian mechanics works, relativity doesn't.

  Basically, take the scientific discoveries up to Lord Kelvin-ish era and they might be explainable in a universe with a limitless speed of light. When you join electrics and magnetics with Maxwell's equations the speed of light pops out (because light is an electromagnetic wave). So anything built on this (and most physics since then is) cannot hold true.

  Honestly, breaking any of them makes your universe not make sense. Unless you do it absurdly well, and I mean on the level of rewriting the laws of physics from the ground up and not caring whether the final result looks like, you will have to handwave something that is a consequence of the thing you changed.  The laws of the physical world are so intertwined that changing anything would result in massive differences from our real world.  

  Lets take gravity as an example,  as it seems to be the least entangled physical constant that we have. If you change it even the slightest bit, you have no guarantee that planets form, or stars, or that stars still go supernova in the same way, or even that elements heavier than lithium can even form. Maybe if you changed it slightly enough not much would change, but then your story world probably wont be much different from the real world, and massive changes happen for even small bits that you change.

  If you want to do anything less trivial than changing gravity, then you most likely alter something deeply fundamental to how our world works. I have no idea how a privileged reference frame would even work in any sense, unless the fabric of the universe was a physical thing, which barely even makes sense. Changing anything about electromagnetism will kill everyone, although it might take a little while for it to happen. Adding a fourth dimension of space probably lets atoms have orbitals in that dimension as well, meaning everything instantly violently reacts with everything, destroying every planet that isnt a gas giant. infinite speed of light at the very least means light can no longer carry information, as c=hv and one of those terms would be an infinity. The constant c is used in so many different formulas that you would probably just stop having a functional universe right there.

  I could go on, but I think ive conveyed the point that at some level, you *have* to hand wave it and say that the world works even with your inclusion, as you wont have a world to write a story in in the first place.

    Can you explain this? I'm trying, but I can't make the conclusion arise from the premise in my mind.

      Atoms bond the way they do because of how many dimensions we have. A sigma bond is essentially linear, even if the electron probability distribution is not. Then the first pi bond extends in one dimension of space, effectively making a 2d plane of electron cloud. Then the second pi bond extends into the third dimension in the same way as the first pi bond did. And it stops there, because we now lack any more dimensions for a bond to form without astronomical angle strain.  If you have 4 dimensions that an electron cloud can occupy, then suddenly every atom above helium becomes a free radical, forming new bonds with anything near it, releasing astronomical amounts of energy.  

      I mean, is suppose if you made some theory of chemistry in 4 dimensions that happens to be exactly like our 3 dimensional chemistry and use that from the start, I guess that works, but if you want a structure to exist in 4 dimensions, then you need new chemistry, and 3 dimensional chemistry if complex enough already

  Ooh, ooh, I have something slightly tangentially helpful to add!

  1: Conservation of mass and conservation of energy are already a little broken by E=mc^(2), which says mass can be destroyed and energy can be created (or vice versa). There's a solid conversion ratio between the two. But all-in-all, the amount of … stuff in the universe does stay the same, yes, once you look at energy and matter as two states of the same stuff.

  Why does this happen? Because of 2. E=mc^2 is a softcore version of Einstein's more applicable spacetime momentum equation, which basically says that mass, energy, and 3d momentum are all shadows of one 4d vector. And since momentum – yes, even 4d spacetime momentum – is conserved through symmetry (as /u/duffmancd [explained](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2l13p1/d_request_important_laws_of_physics_and_what/clqq5y5)) energy and mass appear to be conserved, also.

  So yeah, a violation of 1 is really also a violation of 2, which is highly related to 3.

  The short version: the simplest way of defining single-timeline time travel mechanics leads to the universe conspiring to prevent any nontrivial time travel events.

  It's common for people to postulate breaking conservation of momentum to allow for reactionless drives. This results in breaking conservation of energy. Power = Energy / Time = Force * Distance / Time = Force * Velocity. If you could, for example, produce one newton of thrust with one watt of power, you don't create energy, so long as you're moving below one meter per second. If you move, say, two meters per second, then your kinetic energy is increasing at a rate of two watts, and you're only spending one. If you use a conventional generator to turn this energy back into power, you have a perpetual motion machine. The only way to make it work is to make it take about 300 megawatts per newton, which means you'd have to go faster than light to create energy. But you can get a drive that efficient just by using a flashlight and relying on the momentum from the light leaving, so it's completely pointless. And you've still destroyed energy.

  If it's too easy to violate conservation of energy, or worse, mass, you have to explain why no life has evolved to just do that instead of absorbing energy the way life does in real life.

  Discrete time and space means that the laws of physics won't be invariant under rotation. In extreme versions, you might not be able to make anything rotate. Try to make something spin in Minecraft and you'll see what I mean.

  Continuous matter could cause problems with immeasurable sets. For example, it's theoretically possible to cut one solid ball into five pieces and rearrange them into two solid balls the same size as the original. But if you don't start with them and your physics don't involve the axiom of choice they can't form later on, so it's not a huge issue.

  You didn't ask about it, and you might already know, but for the benefit of anyone who does not, having faster than light travel (not to be confused with infinite speed light) and no privileged reference frame allows for time travel. My favorite example of why is this: http://www.thebestforumever.com/community/threads/tachyon-pistol-duel-thought-experiment.47326/

  >High Kolmogorov Complexity Laws of Physics

  I am struggling to imagine this.

  Math was built by humans to describe order and structure. We are able to conceptualize math because our brains evolved to identify order and structure and patterns, and draw conclusions from these identifications. The math we use, with our axioms etc, is an abstraction of this process.

  It's important to note here that the whole "unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences" is absolute hooey. [There are lots of good arguments against the idea](http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Derek_Abbott/publication/256838918_The_Reasonable_Ineffectiveness_of_Mathematics/links/00b7d523d5bd289428000000), basically hinging on the above-alluded fact that math didn't evolve independently of the universe, and other universes – or even other evolutionary paths within our same universe – would lead to totally different mathematical axioms.

  If we were to try to use our mathematics, which we developed in this universe, to model the laws of another universe with alien laws of physics, then yeah, our models would probably have quite high Kolmogorov complexity. But if there were lifeforms that evolved in that other universe, with their own alien brains and models and mathematical axioms, then if they were to model the laws of their universe with their mathematics, they would certainly get formulas and equations with low Kolmogorov complexity (whether they define it the same way or not).

  **TLDR**: I think Kolmogorov complexity (and all other Occam's razor esque formalizations) the map, not the territory. There is no universe with high Kolmogorov complexity laws of physics.

  Someone tell me if I'm fundamentally misunderstanding something, but otherwise I can't imagine a violation of type 6.
