  I agree with the remarks about blow-by-blow narration being a poor choice for prose fiction.  Well-choreographed fighting doesn't work well on paper the same way it does on screen.  However, it's still important to provide concrete detail.  In particular, blocking (as in [theater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blocking_(stage\))) is really important to things like fight scenes.  When a fight breaks out, I don't need to see every punch, but I do want to have a reasonable understanding of everyone's positions relative to each other, as well as the locations of any entrances/exits, and any significant structures in the room (like tables/barriers or other things that could dictate the flow of action).  This tends to work best if the characters are emotionally reacting to their surroundings, so that the "blocking" doesn't come across as just prattling off a list of facts that you would give to a film director.  Instead of stating "the exit door was on the south side of the room, and Protag was standing at the north side of the room," you can tell me about how Protag backed up until he felt the wall against his back, and then felt a sinking feeling in the pit of his stomach as he realized that the room's only exit was on the other side of five angry men, each brandishing a sharp-looking knife, and several of them already within striking distance.

  Also, if there are any props in the room that are going to be relevant to the action, I want to have an idea of where those props are, ideally in advance of them being part of the action.  Obviously, we all know about the importance of putting Chekhov's gun on the mantelpiece, but sometimes the important prop isn't a gun, but an improvised weapon like a stool, a frying pan, or a beer bottle, and these should be foreshadowed in the same way a loaded gun would be.  (The nice thing about improvised weapons is that you can signpost them early without drawing attention to them in the same way a gun or knife would immediately draw attention to itself.  It's easier to distract the audience from the figurative "loaded gun" when you disguise it as something more innocuous like a golf club or a pair of scissors.)

  A common mistake I see some novice writers make when writing larger action sequences (e.g. a battlefield, or a large brawl with 5+ participants) is that the description is either hyper-focused (giving us no perspective for the broader scope of what is happening around the viewpoint character), or too broad (either giving us a sense of the atmosphere by describing the scene as "chaotic" and "turbulent" without providing concrete details about what is going on, or providing entirely too much detail about parts of the fight that the viewpoint character probably wouldn't be able to pay attention to).  In my experience, a good compromise is to have the viewpoint character mostly focused on their part of their action, but have periodic "status updates" on the things that are happening around them (this could be triggered when they have a brief lull and have the chance to glance around, or when they hear something like a loud gunshot).  Then, after we've gotten our brief status update on the broader battlefield perspective, we go back to focusing on their part of the fight.

  Hey everyone, this week we discuss action scenes and how to ensure they're engaging and meaningful. Hope you enjoy it!

  May 10th is when our [Scrivener](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php) promotion ends, so if you've been trying it out and want to buy it, be sure to use the code RATIONALLY at checkout for 20% off before then!

  The book recommendation this week by /u/alexanderwales is [Altered Carbon](http://amzn.to/2p6orhC) by Richard K. Morgan. It's a hardboiled detective story set hundreds of years in the future, when human minds can be digitally stored and put into empty 'sleeves' at will. A wealthy man, Lauren Bancroft, hires the ex-military detective Takeshi Kovacs to get to the bottom of a supposed suicide; the suicide was Bancroft's, who was restored from backup and has no knowledge of what might have made him take his own life. The novel has all the staples of hardboiled detective fiction, filtered through a transhumanist lens where bodies are disposable, torture takes place in virtual reality, and the femme fatales have been genetically engineered for beauty. The action in particular is a highlight, which is a good thing because there's plenty of violence along the way.
