  I think the reason it gets less is because Erratic doesn't do the read one chapter early if you become a patron thing. I think a lot of people would cave in to read that next chapter just a bit sooner.

  In general, I think early patreon chapters while profitable are awkward because they split up the community of readers from patrons and non-patrons. That said I totally understand why authors do it, and I'm never gonna begrudge an author for trying to make a reasonable amount of money from their work.

  Varies from author to author. TGaB is earning even less. When you say 8k per month I assume you're talking about the Wandering Inn, which I think is exceptional and not to be considered the norm. Wildblow gets 5k a month and for a few years he was pretty much the only person earning enough to be a web novelist full time. I can only speculate, I haven't closely been following any web fiction for a while, but possible reasons are: 

  Different types of stories attract whales, two stories can each have 10k readers, but if one only has $1 donations but the others has 95% $1 donations and 5% $100 donations, that's a massive difference. 

  Maybe PGTE gets more money from other donation sources, e.g lots of one-time pay pal payments.

  Maybe PGTE has poor marketing/incentives to donations.
