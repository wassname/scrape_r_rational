## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

    [Double Agent Vader](https://archiveofourown.org/series/286908) doesn't have a droid rebellion as such, but there is an underground railroad, and the story is rather well-written in general.

  After having dissed it here, I feel obliged to mention that, after three remarkably miserable episodes, episode 4 of season 2 of *The Dragon Prince* is really good for no discernible reason, and episode 5 is pretty alright as well. If it's able to keep up the quality of episode 4 for the rest of its run, then it'll be a really good show, though not quite measuring up to *Avatar*, which is a damn high bar.

  Can anyone please recommend me a rational isekai series? I'm slowly getting into this genre, but I also hate the awful characters and zero-to-hero developments.

  I want to read an isekai story with a clear plot, a rational protagonist who's not a jerk, not clueless, nor absolute good. No harem, please.

  Edit: Fixed. Thank you [/u/Robert\_Barlow](https://www.reddit.com/user/Robert_Barlow) :)
  ```

  - u/Robert_Barlow:
    ```
    Not a jerk, clueless, *and* absolutely good? Or, not a jerk, not clueless, *nor* absolutely good?

    *Worth the Candle* is the only one that really plays with those tropes on a rational level, and it violates a lot of your principles. You could argue (poorly) that his party is a harem, or that he's a jerk, or that he's progressed from nothing to something really quickly.

    (Actually, what's wrong with the zero-to-hero developments? It's not that I find that type of plot super convincing, most of the time, but if you're reading isekai that's basically the *point*. If you go to a fantasy world only to go native, all you've done is make a normal fantasy story with a protagonist that is entirely unrelated to the world-building.)

    Non-rational honorable mentions: in *Konosuba* everyone is a loser but it's a comedy so that doesn't matter. *Re: Zero* doesn't have contempt for its own fantasy world-building, even if the plot punishes its protagonist a lot. (I dislike it when a protagonist is isekai'd into a fantasy world that the author has clearly created as some kind of bizarre revenge fantasy)
    ```

    - u/Jeiseun:
      ```
      I haven't read Worth the Candle before; I'll bookmark it for later. Also, sorry I've worded it wrong - English is not my first language. Thank you for correcting me though.

      Also, I don't hate zero-to-hero as a plot device, but the way it's developed in most Japanese novels. A lot doesn't fulfil their objectives or just pure power fantasy. There's no zero; there's only a hero after a few chapters. Also, the authors spent so much time in midpoint - dungeon delving, food tour, and harem collecting - that I completely forgot the goal of the story.

      Maybe the ones I've read are just bad.

      I don't mind Konosuba as well. I like Grimgar too.
      ```

      - u/Robert_Barlow:
        ```
        >zero-to-hero

        Ah, like how you can tell the author didn't even bother with the slow grind of powering up. I feel like this is a problem that rational fiction solves. In normal isekai the author is throwing someone who has probably read lots of fantasy stories into a fantasy world; this world meets their expectations, thus the character isn't challenged. But the whole point of isekai is the fish-out-of-water scenario, so a rational story would have some kind of element that subverts expectations. (Probably by making the rest of the characters as knowledgeable about the fantasy world as the protagonist - or more! Imagine trying to tell someone from the 1700's how your career works. That is the kind of culture-shock the average salaryman should feel at being dropped into a fantasy world.)

        Unfortunately I don't know many stories like that.

  ```

    ```
    >Any recs for fic that's the opposite of grim dark?

    If the trope, [Crapsack World](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld), is grimdark, then the trope, [Rousseau Was Right](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RousseauWasRight), must be its opposite aka [noblebright](https://1d4chan.org/wiki/Noblebright). The trope basically assumes that everyone must be fundamentally good when they were born and are only misunderstood. Hence every villain can be redeemed or is an example of Good vs Good.

    The rest of this comment is me meandering into the differences between grimdark and noblebright.

    Just to clarify the difference between grimdark and noblebright, grimdark is about a world/setting which is horrible and miserable and the main characters can't or aren't doing anything to change things aka WH40K. While noblebright is about worlds/settings of wonder and amazement where the main characters are actually accomplishing things of importance aka Star Trek.

    Someone might ask about nobledark where we have terrible worlds with characters achieving good things or grimbright where there are amazing worlds with no one able to do anything, but these sort of stories are rare. One example for nobledark is Bezerk the manga, since while things can get better, it demands everything the main characters can possibly give. The other example for grimbright is Sandman by Neil Gaiman where the world is amazing and incredible, but not even the main character who is basically a god to other gods can change anything worthwhile.
    ```

  - u/AurelianoTampa:
    ```
    I think of Worm as being the go-to example of grimdark rational fiction. While only rational-adjacent, The Gods Are Bastards is my go-to polar opposite. Hardly anyone dies, the characters grow and develop over time into better people, and the world building is great. It's long and not everyone's cup of tea, but 15 books in I still check for weekly updates.

    https://tiraas.net/about/
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      I dislike calling Worm grimdark. One of the main points of the original Grimdark world, Warhammer 40k, is that there are no good guys. The Humans are literal fascists, the Orks are savages, the Tau are communist fascists...

      Worm is different. Most people there *are* actually trying to be good, or trying to be *better*. Taylor had an extremely jaded view of authority, and it's influenced a lot of readers, but if you look at how interlude characters describe the world, or what Victoria from Ward says about Earth Bet, its people and its institutions were largely *good*.

      That said, The Gods Are Bastards is a really nice counterweight to Wildbow's works, and I recommend it as well.

  Does anyone knows any LitRPG that explores how a ruleset would incentivize difference from classical fantasy? As much as I love WtC, the setting is intentionally disjointed from the level system.

  Examples of things it could include:

  1. I want a group of people who gather information about classes which the MC asks about classes before selecting their class.
  2. A toddler being allowed to get the last hit on a bound monster, being told to invest in intelligence, and now having adult-like intelligence. 
  3. Psychotic serial killers being very high level and guards finding solutions to handle such high level individuals without relying on adventurers, either with ethical or less ethical means. Possibly guards being rewarded with the honor of killing a caught criminal for the XP.
  4. Ways of getting XP being sold on the market.

    This is one of the things that I've been working on in my spare time for quite a while, though I don't think that I would go so far as you seem to want (which, from what I'm getting, is a wildly alien society). Mostly, it would be a method for making all of the mechanics of a traditional MMO into diegetic elements of the world, and without the actual "online" stuff in it. I've got a worldbuilding doc going for it, but probably won't write it anytime soon, and I need to find the plot.

    Edit: Sorry this isn't a recommendation, I forgot which thread I was in.
    ```

    - u/Sonderjye:
      ```
      I mean I'm really interested in this too. 

      It doesn't have to be a wildly alien world. I'm totally down for a society who were just recently transformed into a litrpg and are now changing.

      What are some of the mechanics you have been struggling with implementing?
      ```

      - u/alexanderwales:
        ```
        1) Classic RPG health is basically inconsequential until you've lost your last hitpoint. The reasons for this are pretty readily apparent, because otherwise it's a negative feedback loop, and those aren't fun (e.g. you get hit, you break or injure your leg, that makes you easier to hit, injuring you worse, making you easier to injure, etc.). But in terms of how it would work in an actual world, it's totally wonky; everyone is apparently in perfect health until they're unconscious/dead. You get all kinds of knock-on effects from it, most of which are just silly, not actually compelling on a society scale. (And there are a bunch of ways to modify it, some of which are used by actual games, but then you're running away from the premise a little bit. My preferred method is a division between HP/WP, with HP being something like a slowly regenerating shield, and WP being your physical health, but that's enough of a variant that it feels like a cheat.)

        2) XP for kills leads to a bunch of "cheating" that most games will do their best to sand away, because a lvl 60 character killing things for a party of lvl 1 characters isn't usually that fun for anyone involved, it's just people following incentives in unfun ways that proper game design attempts to avoid. It's difficult for games to approximate "XP for challenges" or "XP for accomplishments" or "XP for fun", but that's what they strive for in various ways. There are, again, a lot of ways to tweak this, but you get further away from the premise of following MMORPG rules. You *could* set up a broken world where everyone hits MAX lvl within a few days, but if you're going to do that, it's nearly equal to just removing the leveling system entirely, except as an exercise in worldbuilding wankery.

        3) Discrete attributes *mostly* work, or are at least sensible most of the time, even if they're in defiance of how humans actually work and the nature of physics, but the degenerate case is that the rich get richer, which seems like from a narrative standpoint lends itself to a story about oligarchies, which ... okay, sure, that would be fine, but doesn't actually interest me that much.

        I don't know, it would be easy to just take things to their degenerate conclusion, but the risk is that I end up with a world that I don't particularly feel like writing about, or one that isn't actually that interesting, or which isn't actually saying anything about anything, and instead is just an exercise in running simulations in my head.
        ```

        - u/Sonderjye:
          ```
          1. What are you seeing as being consequences of everyone being at perfect health until they hit 0? It doesn't unintuitively strike me as having severe consequences even if it does seem wonky.
          2. After more thinking I think that exploiting a world in which xp is given for kills probably is strawmanning the litrpg genre. I feel that the problem of xp in most litrpg is that xp is given out in a way that implies that there's a sentient intelligence that watches everyone all the time to prevent abuse.   
          If XP were given out by 'challenges'  or 'accomplishment', then you would get worse XP the better equiptment you had, and you would expect people to deliberately not use their powerful equiptment in some cases to get more XP.   
          If equiptment didn't count in that equation though I could see a coloseum style XP grind in which people paid to borrow silly strong equiptment for the match, baring high requirements of said equiptment.   
          I wonder. Can you think of any coherent 'usual' XP system for litrpg in which you wouldn't see  the following XP for gold trade: the buyer  being granted (temporary) ownership of a deadly trap to then use food to bait farm-monsters from a steel cage into the trap?

          You mentioned degenerate a few times in this and the other post. What would you predict to be the degenerate conclusion?
          ```

  - u/theibbster:
    ```
    It's not completely widespread in the story but I can think of a couple of examples in The Wandering Inn. For example the army of Liscor officially includes every single civilian. This means all the soldiers can have classes like captain or commander which have a limited number based on how many people there are in the army.
    ```

  - u/IICVX:
    ```
    Andrew Sieple's Generica novels do this a bit - the Threadbare series is kind of an intro to the world and the system from the perspective of a toy golem, while the (still being written) Small Medium series is more of an examination of the cultures that spring up as a result of the system. 

    For example: halvens, the local halfling knockoff, eat a lot. Because halflings eat a lot, right? 

    No, it's actually because one of the only ways to gain Endurance is by levelling up your racial class. Endurance is the stat that controls stamina regeneration. And the "halven" racial class grants zero endurance per level. So to regain stamina at a reasonable rate, they need to eat a lot of food - because food provides a stamina regeneration buff.
    ```

    - u/Flashbunny:
      ```
      I think that's sort of backwards though - they haven't taken a mechanic and followed to its conclusion, they've justified their conclusion with a mechanic. It's cool, but not what I think is being looked for.

    Copy Pasta of a rec I gave a while ago.

    **[Wearing Robert's Crown](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11861559/1/Wearing-Robert-s-Crown)** - ASOIAF SI, who SI's into Robert Baratheon's brain at some point during his rebellion, with a mixture of memories and personality. Truly unique thing of this one is that the PoV never enters Robert's head, it is always from the people around him, so if it wasn't for the reader recognizing the clear evidence of both Earth knowledge and foreknowledge of canon, you'd never know this was a SI. It's honestly a great approach, Robert is genuinely clever in how he maneuvers. He has funded tech development into directions he knows are important, introduced various improvements anonymously through a third party so only the reader can recognize that he was responsible for it, takes several large actions to prepare Westeros for the Long Night, it's fantastic stuff. One of the better implementations of uplift.

      Thanks for this rec - I found the central conceit of a SI through others' eyes super interesting!

    I am not sure if it is exactly rational but it is fairly reasonable. The Way of Choices/Ze Tian Ji has characters with actual motivations for what they do. There are alliances, different factions with political maneuvering, and it has amazing world building. There are reasons for character successes and failures. 

    Power scaling is actually really well done imo. The overpowered people with top tier strength are established right away and always exist within the world so you always have them as a frame of reference. People of different power levels exist in the story at all times. It's not like once the main character reaches level 5, everyone is level 4-6. Then when the main character is level 7, everyone is level 6-10 like it is in most wuxia/xianxia.

    Characters have histories from before the story started, there are established rivalries and alliances, but each individual has their own goals and dreams as well. It gives characters a lot of depth that 99.9% of wuxia/xianxia don't. It's a slow read at first as it sets up the world and gives the main character time to establish himself from a no name instead of just handing him OP powers from the get go. However, I highly recommend it.

  I'm getting through the "Drifters" manga and would reccomend it. (So far; I'm 33 chapters in.) If I told you it was a mass isekai into a generic fantasy world I would be technically correct, except the people getting isekai'd are historical personalities like Scipio Africana, Oda Nobunaga, Hitler, and [](#s "Jesus"). Even better, the conflict is between the isekai'd people, with them serving as ethically grey antagonists and protagonists. (I'd say "heroes" and "villains", but that would technically make Hitler a hero, so those descriptions don't map onto the story well.)
