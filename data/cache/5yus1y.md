  I tried reading this a while back, got confused right away. Can someone explain to me what's going on in the prologue and first chapter or two?

    It's a prequel to a sequel to a fanfic (a shadow of a shadow of a shadow distilled down through *four* authors now).  I think if it can't stand on its own two legs, you can just move on.

      I think that's a fair critique: it's  very reliant on the reader's familiarity with the extended HPMOR-verse. (Even though it's explicitly a SIgnificant Digits prequel, it references some of the other major HPMOR-sequels)
      ```

  - u/NanashiSaito:
    ```
    The prologue is basically the setup for a giant causal loop that was responsible for the Atlantis disaster. 

    The fake-prologue is an exploration of what might have happened in an alternate universe if Voldemort had won.

    Chapter 1 and 2 explore the Atlantis disaster and those who survived it.
    ```
