## February Genre Fiction Challenge

### Post:

Oooh la la! Itâ€™s February once again, with its holiday dedicated to love, hearts, and cute, fluffy things. Thatâ€™s rightâ€¦itâ€™s Groundhog day!

To celebrate this special time of year, what better way than to write some genre fiction?

For the month of February, your challenge is to write a ROMANCE.

A short description of the genre:

*The romance genre places its primary focus on the relationship and romantic love between two people, and usually has an â€˜emotionally satisfying and optimistic ending,' aka the main characters get a 'happily ever after.' The plot of most romances can be summed up as: â€˜people who have a hole in their hearts find that missing piece in each other.â€™ (And yes, that line is actually from a book I read about writing romance. It fits surprisingly well.)*

Other than that, the genre is pretty broad. Though there are PLENTY of tropes to choose from, you can read about a few of them here: [https://blog.reedsy.com/romance-tropes/](https://blog.reedsy.com/romance-tropes/)

Guidelines:

â€¢	There is no set word limit. Write and post as many words as you like! (technically there's a 500 word minimum, but I'm not counting)

â€¢	Youâ€™re encouraged to include rational elements in the fiction, but the main challenge is to write an enjoyable genre fiction. Everything else is gravy.

â€¢	Post your work as a comment to this thread, which can include a link or the entire story (if it is flash fiction). PM me if you want me to post your work anonymously.

â€¢	Last day to post is February 28th!

Optional prompts: (prompt 11 has me cackling)

(Bonus points if your story includes groundhogs, the real MVP of February.)

I'm also thinking that if this contest runs all year, I'll create an archive of all our 2021 genre fiction stories. It would be sort of like a rational fiction anthology. :)

That's all guys! Start writing!

  *Flower Wreath Day, Five-hand Year after Big Winter*

  Grug feel stupid. This no contest for Grug. Flower Wreath Day stupid day. Good for swift hunter like Werg, good for smart hunter like Hyrt. Grug not swift not smart, Grug only big and strong. And ugly.

  Many hunter run to forest, find many flower make pretty wreath for favourite young woman. Come back fast. Grug feel lost. What flower pretty? How make wreath? Grug try weave many dandelion, but dandelion fall apart. Big ugly mess, like Grug face.

  Many hunter success, make pretty wreath for young woman. Wise Old Woman approve, give blessing. Grug grubby thick fingers fail make wreath again! Almost no young woman left, and Grug still no make gift.

  Grug sit and think. Not easy for Grug, thinking. Hyrt always say "Hyrt think, then Grug do, that better". But Hyrt nowhere now, no help!

  Grug angry throw stick at tree. Stick lock in branches. Grug feel Think form in head!

  In North Cave Fara say: "Wise Woman, Grug cut bad. Many blood go. Fara afraid Grug spirit go! Wise Woman help Grug fast! Fara do anything help!"

  Old Wise Woman ask: "Fara do anything help? Anything? This omen word. Fara make sacrifice to Bear Sprit, make Grug heal? "

  Fara say "Yes!"

  Old Wise Woman ask : "Fara sacrifice one eye to Bear Spirit? No eye left?"

  Fara shudder, hesitate. Fara speak: "...yes, Wise Woman. Fara sacrifce eye for Grug"

  Old Wise Woman say: Fara prepare sacrifice. Fara make Spirit Chant. Wise Woman stitch wound. Make Grug wake up.

  Grug half-sleep half-not sleep. No blood make weak. Hear Fara speak. Grug think in head: "Fara no lose eye! Grug better die. Grug stupid no use to Fara, no use to tribe."

  Fara sing Spirit Chant. Fara cry, Spirit Chant not very good. Fara afraid lose eye. No eye left. Fara fear Grug die more.

  Old Wise Woman ask: "Fara ready? Make sacrifice? Fara give Grug Waking Herb. Fara give Grug kiss. Then Fara pluck Fara eye, make sacrifice. Understand?"

  Fara ask: "Many Tribe hate Grug hate Fara for attack Werg. Not share meat. How Fara feed Grug?"

  Old Wise Woman say: "Stupid ask Fara. Grug make Fara big pretty fish trap for Flower Wreath Day. Fara go, catch big pretty fish!"

  Grug listen. Head dizzy. See Old Wise Woman go. See Fara stay in cave with Grug. Fara smile. Fara cry. Grug grin. Grug feel happy. Maybe Grug feel Waking Herb in head? No. Grug think Grug feel heartbeat for Fara.

  What are you doing!? My 100k WiP urban fantasy story I mentioned last month is actually an urban fantasy *romance*. 

  I'm going to finish the dang story I was working on last month (I was sick for 9 days which threw a wrench in my writing plans) but look at me shaking my fist at you for this!

    Interesting idea! My only critique is the android's verbosity was kind of tiring to read. I found myself skipping some parts of the dialogue.

    I did read to the end though, and I liked the ending. :) Nice work!

    Great work! I really liked this.

    There are a couple of his lines that stay in her font. I think it should be easy to notice because the paragraphs usually alternate, and these were three in a row of her font.
