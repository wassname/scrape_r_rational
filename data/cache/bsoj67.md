## [RT] [WIP]I Am Going To Die (In This Game-Like Dimension) Chapters 1-43

### Post:



When mysterious portals start opening up around the world at large events, swallowing everybody, you’d think that would warrant some kind of danger pay when you have to sell hotdogs at a Comic Con, right? ‘No, of course not; what are the odds of that happening here, out of all the big events in the world?’

Well, Emma was always pretty good at beating the odds when it came to shitty luck.

Now she’s stuck in a strange dimension, where the normal rules don’t seem to apply, together with a costumed crowd who seem strangely happy about this whole thing.

At least, until the first people start dying.

  Can you explain why this story would be interesting to the /r/rational audience specifically please? What elements make it rational or rational adjacent?
  ```

  I like this story a lot, but it's not rational. A major part of the main character's character is that she constantly takes huge unessacary risks and thus far it always pays off.

    ```
    That's really funny given that the description says that she has bad luck.
    ```

      Her bad luck is being sucked into the dimension. Apart from that she seems to have pretty normal luck. 

      I will say this, she doesn't survive her risk taking by luck. But by a combination of skill and willpower. Though you could say the fact she hasn't bitten off more than she can chew to be improbable good luck in of itself.

  This story is not rational, and in terms of the problems that the main character must overcome, badly written too, however entertaining.

  The main character is dumped into another universe without any knowledge of where they are or why they were transferred, along with others. By pure chance, she and a small percentage of others who arrived with her have bodies that can adapt to the different climate this world has. And though she doesn't have any knowledge about where she is, fortunately she is paired with a mentor-like entity that can teach her about the world, to a degree. The mentor is limited by what they can say however, as are the mentors of other transportees. This leads to many of the transportees dying as time goes on.

  Luckily, our protagonist has a mentor that can and does give out information that they're not supposed to give when they judge it necessary, which always fortunately let's the main character know what needs to be done when the time is right.

  Some things are easier said than done however. It just so happens that said mentor has the ability to control the protagonist and pull off feats that the main character isn't capable of doing, to solve things that should be impossible for her. This is, of course, not normally allowed so it was just done that one time.

  Our main character also coincidentally has the perfect backstory to most of the problems that show up in front of her - she has experience as a gymnast, and all of the difficult tests that have appeared so far have been parkour-esque tests!

  Oh no. Our main character just got into a problem - one of their five party members got kidnapped, and they're too weak to rescue them! How fortunate that they received four powerful items literally a paragraph before this sudden problem popped up: it's even exactly enough for each member of the remaining party to have one! What a crazy coincidence.

  ----------

  Basically each time things grow tense they're literally saved by the powers of a) powerful mentor doing something that was earlier stated they can't do, sometimes only paragraphs prior, or b) luck.

  The author has stated that The Tutorial Is Too Hard is an inspiration for this, which is what drew me to this series, but frankly, they're nothing alike.

    > Luckily, our protagonist has a mentor that can and does give out information that they're not supposed to give when they judge it necessary, which always fortunately let's the main character know what needs to be done when the time is right.

    The mentor has exactly one ability to directly intervene, which is to put the protagonist into a meditative trance. She doesn't do it just once, but whenever it's useful. And the mentor sticks to the rules about what advice she can and can't give; on occasion she does ask the higher ups for a judgement call but accepts their rulings. 

    > Our main character also coincidentally has the perfect backstory to most of the problems that show up in front of her - she has experience as a gymnast

    True. But being a gymnast is hardly a huge stretch. 

    > Oh no. Our main character just got into a problem - one of their five party members got kidnapped, and they're too weak to rescue them! How fortunate that they received four powerful items literally a paragraph before this sudden problem popped up: it's even exactly enough for each member of the remaining party to have one! What a crazy coincidence.

    That wasn't a coincidence. She was specifically looking for those exact items, she knew everyone in her party would need one which influenced how many she picked up. And her friend was kidnapped because it was publicly known that she had a high chance of finding those items and the kidnappers wanted to blackmail her for them.

    I agree with this assessment.  My dislike of the story is that it feels too "rat in the maze".  Which is literally true.  Our protagonist doesn't really do any long or short term planning, or get past obstacles on her own merits.  Moreover, the general flaw with this kind of story is that "played straight", where the protagonist is playing the game by the rules and has not found any significant cheats or exploits, it makes for a story on rails.  It makes for a story where the protagonist has no agency and thus while the story might be "rational" it's not good to read.  Like reading about the fate of a chicken in a slaughterhouse that evades each near certain death by sheer luck because the chicken lacks the intelligence to really plan anything,

  Not sure if this has been here before, but thought it deserved some more attention. 

  Also, sorry if I broke some posting rule. Never posted here before.

  I've had this on my 'to read' list for a bit. Looks like there's enough written now to sink my teeth into.

  Having read it now, I think it's pretty good. I think there's enough features in it that would appeal to the people here even if it's not completely rational. The main character definitely takes unnecessary risks / thrill seeking but you could argue that's a character flaw and not anti-rational. The same character also thinks about how to maximize their use of time (...sometimes).

  All-in-all I'll be continuing to read it.

    To me the anti-rational part is not her risk taking personality - she even makes good arguments for why taking risks is necessary. 

    The anti-rational part is that she takes lots of risks that pretty much always pay off in her favour, usually immediately. One (ironically the most sensible, least risky one) caused serious short term problems but resulted in pure benefits long term.
