## [META] One post for multiple chapters of a story?

### Post:

It came up in the recent Worth the Candle thread that someone had only yet read the first of the three chapters of the update. Unfortunately that means a lot of the content in the thread were spoilers for them. Common practice around here is to not post spoilers from the "future" in old threads, but there's no such safety mechanism for one thread covering multiple chapters.

Would there be any community support for trying to establish a norm of one post per chapter, rather than one post per possibly-many-chapters update?

I notice that Practical Guide To Evil gets one post per chapter even when two or more chapters are released at the same time (often an interlude and a main chapter).

  If it's stated in the title that multiple chapters have been released, they really only have themselves to blame for coming back early? It would be like someone following a link to a single-chapter release, coming back after having read half of the chapter and getting "spoiled" for the second half.

    This indeed. Completely their own fault if they don't even read the link they click. Be glad it was actually the fic and not something malicious. :D

  I'm against that. The recent WTC update was 6 chapters long, so what, 6 posts? We'll have to open each one of them to read all the discussion, that's just not user friendly. If the author sees fit to release multiple chapters at once, so be it.

  Reddit media discussion threads are in general spoilery. Once you get burned the first (second third ...) time, its really your own fault.

  I just hold off reading discussions if I have yet to finish reading a thing unless it's those serials on blogs with per-chapter comments, otherwise I just avoid reddit/discord

  I spoiled myself this way once with WtC, and was frustrated, but it was really just my own fault.

  At most it takes 15-20 extra minutes to read the other chapters, and all separating chapters out would do is make everyone discuss things in the latest released chapter thread, and clutter up the subreddit.

  Maybe there would be a couple people posting in earlier chapters about what they think will happen in the next ones, but I don't feel like it would be a meaningful discussion.

  If it *did* manage to get people to discuss things in multiple threads, then what it would really do is fragment the discussion, and likely reduced the overall quality. People would have to read through 5 or so different threads, and a lot of it would be the same content.

  More time would be lost dealing with a thread for each chapter than  you'd save by being able to comment after each one. And if you don't have time to finish reading all the chapters, do you really have time to discuss them?

  I'd be strongly against this. I think most people will read all chapters and discuss them, it would majorly fragment discussion to have separate posts and I think this cost would outweigh the benefit to the small minority who read them one at a time and then want to discuss

  Personally I think that we already have too many posts about some of the more fast-updating stories. Right now there are four threads about A Practical Guide to Evil on the front page, which are 8, 6, 3 and 1 days old.  It's a good story, and I love reading it, but having four threads about it at once feels cluttered and a bit redundant.

  I do accept that I am rather alone in this opinion, which is fine. But I would like to express my opposition to any proposal that further aggravates this situation.

    I definitely agree with that, and I think that it's one of the benefits of doing batch releases of chapters (in addition to the fact that more material means that more substantial conversation can take place, and it's easier to fit a full arc or half-arc into a batch).

    I don't think there's much to be done about it, not from a mod standpoint anyway. *Ideally* conversation would move to /r/PracticalGuideToEvil/, where dedicated discussion makes sense (similar to how many people here read Wildbow's works, but discussion is almost entirely on /r/parahumans), but that's a somewhat tall ask, especially since sister communities are not the same as this one, value different things, etc.

  I wouldn't say that it should be a *general* norm in the sense that we should frown on it if the author opts for multi chapter posts. The release timings and posting style are the author's choice (or the poster, if the author is not posting for themselves). But if someone wants to discuss something without being fully caught up i certainly don't see the harm in whoever wants to have the discussion just posting that chapter and discussing it. Or if a specific person or an author wishes to use the one at a time format that should be fine.

  WtC often releases multiple chapters at once. A new topic per chapter means that, when I see the new topics, I then need to double-check how many there are and which is the earliest chapter I have not read, as opposed to just following the link and neatly ending up at the start of the newly-released section.
  ```

- u/MilesSand:
  ```
  So what you're saying is that people should be reporting apgte for breaking rule 3? I think he gets around it by having a reader post it rather than posting his own story.

  The rule is there because the chapters bury the discussion otherwise and bad (etc) daily stories bury good (etc) monthly stories just by posting over and over.
