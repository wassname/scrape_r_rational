## Should a work of rational fiction try to answer every question it might ask?

### Post:

*Alternate title: What constitutes a "loose end?"*

For starters, there's absolutely a place for leaving certain things unexplained in fiction, rational or otherwise. A work could have an unreliable narrator, or it could end on a cliffhanger that's meant to convey some specific emotion, or it could just be an entire series of "Wtf?" moments where the journey is the destination (looking at you, Twin Peaks). Those are all viable tools as a means to storytelling that's exciting and engaging. They don't guarantee a good story, obviously - nothing does - but the fact that these are accepted storytelling techniques goes to show that you can successfully integrate unanswered questions into your fiction.

There are ways of doing it wrong, of course. When Lost ended in 2010, it left a lot of fans really upset because they felt like their questions hadn't been adequately answered. Lost may be a bit of an outlier - that show was *built* around asking questions, creating tantalizing mysteries that led the viewer to the next episode - but it's not unique in leaving fans feeling burned. Most works of fiction are pretty much expected to tie up loose ends, and failure to do so is usually seen as a bad thing.

So the question becomes, what constitutes a loose end? I want to talk about this in the context of rational fiction specifically, because I think a little more tends to be expected of rational fiction. Worlds are more developed, superpowers aren't as handwavy, systems are pretty much set in stone and made obvious to the reader. If a character randomly mutates a new power in a non-rational story, the reader (or watcher or whatever) may be expected to just accept it at face value. ("Whoa! His foe was so strong, he just *had* to attain that next power level! Works for me!") In a rational story, there's probably going to be some expectation of "Where did this come from? How did this happen?" And it'll be treated as a mystery to be solved, a loose end to be tied up.

Thoughts? Would you agree that the standards are different for rational writing? What in your opinion *would* be acceptable to leave hanging?

  I write a web serial, so I've done some thinking about this stuff.  (The Fifth Defiance, if I'm doing blatant self promoting!  Like comment subscribe pledge my patr...)

  I do think that rat works tend to have less tolerance for Deus Ex Machina, yeah?  Like, if light speed ramming works then your space combat should have looked very dif from the start.

  But at the same time I don't think that means you need to be constantly justifying your twists against a reader in your mind who is confused.  It's more like...write in such a way that you don't confuse that imaginary reader?  Like, hrrm, rather than confusing them and then clarifying I think the rat author tries to set the rules down from the start in such a way that the readers don't get confused.

  To be sure, if you do need a twist out of left field, then it is probably a good idea to have someone explain what is going on.  The readers won't stay invested in a story if the rules are Calvinball (or, I guess, some of them won't.), but if you can tell that you are gonna need some exposition on a beat you can usually slot in some prep work a chapter or two ahead.

  So yeah, long story short, tie up your loose ends if they are big enough to bother your model of your readers, but better than that is not creating loose ends if you can avoid it.

  P P S, obviously the iron rule of internet fiction, "you probably aren't getting paid, so write what you want" overrides this.

  Okay, replied earlier but Reddit ate it.  Trying again: Also a serial writer.  My experience is that I can't always predict what questions my readers will ask, or how they will infer rules from context.  There's a certain amount of Shakespeare-in-the-bush going on, which I enjoy.  Pyrebound is plainly dependent on the rules being slowly unfolded, so there's an appetite there for things not being all set out at the start; you just can't contradict established rules, or obviously tease a question and never answer it.

  I don't think I could ever answer *every* question readers have, especially not the ones that are secondary to the storyline.  Part of building a good world is leaving a lot of stuff peripheral, with little hints of more to discover around the corner.  As someone once put it to me, a good author leaves blank space on the map for readers to fill in with their imagination.  There's a terrible and tedious finality about having everything nailed down.

  (How many different fan theories are there about the powers of "The Sleeper" from Worm?)  
  (yes I know Worm isn't really ratfic)

    I actually saw your other reply before it got eaten - I'm glad you retyped it so that I have a chance to respond. :)

    I think that this is a really good thing to consider. This line especially stuck out to me:

    >There's a terrible and tedious finality about having everything nailed down.

    It reminds me of when Star Wars explained how The Force works. That's a situation that would have benefitted from having *less* explanation, and it wasn't even a matter of leaving a question unanswered - it was just fine the way it was before, as a not-even-question.

    Good thoughts!

      Thanks!  Straying a bit farther afield, even as a teenager it struck me that Tolkien was wise to never describe Sauron.  He showed his eye, he had Pippin react to the sight of him, but Sauron has no clear form in the books.  I always thought that, even if he'd come up with something utterly ghastly, it would still be less impressive than whatever terror we imagined.  The giant form in the Peter Jackson movies isn't nearly so ominous to me.
      ```

      - u/Ibbot:
        ```
        I have the opposite reaction, just based off of my own (admittedly unusual) experience.  I’m aphantastic (sp?), so that unclear form is staying that way.  That ghastly terror who isn’t even described might as well be the same as mook #4 whose description is merely unmemorable.

        Edit: substituted "experience" for "opinion"
        ```

      - u/TrajectoryAgreement:
        ```
        Technically Sauron is described in the Silmarillon, but yeah I agree with your point.
        ```

    - u/MilesSand:
      ```
      What star wars did was they established an expectation of what level of explanation is available, and then went against it by explaining things with a  conspiracy theory level of plausibility. They botched things so badly that they shouldn't get to be an example. 

      Then again "the Kessel run is actually timed in distance" is a more popular explanation than "the scam artist was lying but the guy on the run was too desperate to call him on it" so maybe that's just how the fans like to roll.
      ```

- u/EliezerYudkowsky:
  ```
  You should answer every question of plot about what actually happened inside the story, and every mystery the reader was invited to solve; anything else is optional; this is a universal rule and not just a ratfic one.

  Be warier than I was about what the reader may think they were invited to solve.  HJPEV's brief thoughts about a Source of Magic paying attention to a genetic marker were intended to illustrate why that theory was implausible, and designate the whole problem as hard enough not to have a promised solution; instead many readers thought it was setting up a Why Magic? plotline.
  ```

  - u/Sophronius:
    ```
    I'm not sure that was really because of that one scene. I think it was mostly that the central concept of the story was "Harry is raised by scientists and applies his knowledge to the wizarding world". It makes sense for the reader to assume that the plot would then be driven by that central concept. Plot resolutions like Dumbledore's hall of prophesy, or Voldemort's bias towards death which caused him to essentially defeat himself, or Harry leaving Azkaban to Hermione then feel less satisfactory.

    If there was one line that was to blame though, I'd say it was this one:

    >HARRY JAMES POTTER-EVANS-VERRES grew up in a house filled to the brim  with books. He once bit a math teacher who didn't know what a logarithm  was. He's read Godel, Escher, Bach and Judgment Under Uncertainty:  Heuristics and Biases and volume one of The Feynman Lectures on Physics.  And despite what everyone who's met him seems to fear, he doesn't want  to become the next Dark Lord. He was raised better than that. **He wants to discover the laws of magic and become a god.**

    Like I said in another post, that's the equivalent line of Naruto going "I am going to become the Hokage!" The moment a main character makes a pronouncement like that, readers treat it as a promise by the author. If you're not going to go that route, it needs to be then undercut by the character having an epiphany later on and deciding to change their goals. But Harry in HPMOR never changes his goal from "discover the laws of magic and fix everything", which makes it feel like the ending did not deliver on the story's original promise.

    (The rest of what you said was 100% right, btw)
    ```

    - u/fassina2:
      ```
      He solved death, starvation and pretty much every world problem. i.e fix everything. 

      &#x200B;

      For him to discover the laws of magic it'd be X extra effort and story length just to hit 1 checklist that we can be sure he'll do anyway without us needing to watch it happen.. It'd probably just be equations and mathematical formulas anyway like physics, watching the mc do imaginary physics like equations with a team of scientist may be fun, but it would also have detracted from the story being told and message being conveyed.

      From the ending you can assume he did do it in some way or another, imho in this case we don't need to be shown it explicitly to be satisfied.
      ```

      - u/Sophronius:
        ```
        It is a fact that it was not satisfactory to some readers - whether or not you think everyone \*should\* be satisfied doesn't really matter. A resolution can be 100% sensible and logical and rational and still not work on an emotional level. In this sense and in this sense only, the reader is always right.

        Or as Neil Gaiman put it:

        >“Remember: when people tell you something’s wrong or doesn’t work for them, they are almost always right. When they tell you exactly what they think is wrong and how to fix it, they are almost always wrong.”
        ```

- u/None:
  ```
  This might not be what /r/rational wants to hear, but I'd only get annoyed by an unsolved mystery when the characters consider it important to solve, and the story specifically called attention to the mystery beforehand.
  ```

  - u/Sophronius:
    ```
    This is not just a valid answer, but the only correct answer. The term I would use to describe this is “the promise the author made to the reader”. E.g when Naruto shouts “I’m gonna be the greatest ninja ever and prove myself to everyone!” he’s not just saying that as a character - that’s the author telling the reader what kind of story they can expect. If the rest of the story is then about flower arranging, the reader will feel betrayed.

    It’s the exact same thing with rational fiction. The author has to communicate which mysteries are in scope, and which are out of scope, and then deliver on that promise. Metropolitan man never promised a scientific justification for superman’s abilities, and we never got one, but it did promise a rational confrontation between the characters, and it did that very well.

    HPMOR violated this rule somewhat by introducing concepts and encouraging the reader to speculate on them, like the mirror of Erised, and then just dropping them. That’s the kind of thing that can leave the audience feeling unsatisfied.
    ```

    - u/Quibbloboy:
      ```
      I agree with both of you: calling attention to a question and making it a big deal draws in the reader, and then it's kind of a dick move to just *not* pay off that setup. I think I alluded to this a little bit in the OP post, when I mentioned how Lost made itself about the mysteries but then didn't follow through on all of them.

      You're right about HPMOR. There were more of these, weren't there? I seem to recall the Atlantis plot line being abandoned, and Harry's motivation to determine the "root" of magic (maybe this is kinda the same plot line) also dropped off as he got distracted by other things.

      There was also most definitely a scene where Professor Quirrell pledged to teach students how to cast the Killing Curse, and that never happened.
      ```

      - u/Sophronius:
        ```
        Yup. It's especially dickish when you essentially hold the viewer hostage through sunk cost, constantly telling them "you can't stop now when you're so close!" and then just extending the story season after season without resolution. In fact, I remember the writers of Lost explicitly promising that "the ending is not X", and then of course the ending was X anyway.

        You're right that there are better examples from HPMOR, but I'm not sure I would count Atlantis as one of them. That's just something Harry mentioned offhand - it was never really a promise. Quirrel not teaching the Killing Curse was also a pretty minor thing. But it's true that Harry never really tried to figure out the nature of magic, never really formed a Bayesian conspiracy, never had a true rationalist duel with Voldemort, never did anything to bring back Hermione, and generally didn't display the kind of agency that was promised.

        Instead, the ending was more like a regular Harry Potter novel: It was very well written in terms of building up tension, and it had stuff like the mirror that gave off a true sense of wonder and magic, but none of it really led anywhere and ultimately the villain mostly defeated himself. And of course there was Dumbledore's hall of prophesy which also had very little to do with the mysteries that had been set up beforehand.

        It's realistic, of course, that sometimes problems and solutions come out of nowhere in a way that feels unsatisfactory, but in terms of writing it definitely violates some important rules.
        ```

        - u/sparrafluffs:
          ```
          I think that the drawback of Harry Potter in a rational world is that the Hogwarts of jkrs book one is so hugely unexplored that it takes books and books to uncover and understand it all.

          That Big Yud was able to cover decently the mirror of erised and the final dungeon of the sorcerers stone is a great win for him.

          Taken as a complete work, i think it did everything it promised: quirrell had a plan, and carried it out. A boyish rat 11year old was able to pull a rabbit out of a hat as the prophecy foretold.

          The other unanswered questions weren't promised by the characters who drove the story. It was essentially the masterwork of quirrell narrated by Harry.

          Tl;dr the story was focussed on harry being manipulated, and other plot elements outside of that weren't necessarily promised to the reader.
          ```

  - u/RuggedTracker:
    ```
    I agree, the world feels terribly "themepark-y" when everything is introduced just to be solved and / or justify something. You might have a world prop full of fun and fascinating things, but ultimately it doesn't feel realistic because everything somehow relates to a single character (or group of characters).
    ```

  What bothers *me* in a story is when the plot or rules aren't explained well enough for someone to write a fanfic about it. Mainly this is because I like inserting my own (halfway competent) characters into stories along with empowering the bad guys, then shaking the whole thing to see what comes out. Now, that's purely a matter of personal preference, but I think it makes a decent rule of thumb. *Write in such a way that someone else could pick up where you left off*. Not all mysteries need to be solved; some can be gracefully avoided or simply left as part of the background; they exist as a sign that real life isn't always neat and tidy and some things just stay uncertain.

  Okay in ratfic:

  * A character develops a new power based on foundations laid earlier in the story; (Worm second triggers, training montages, "leveling up", artifact acquisition)
  * Superpowers or magic exist; this is taken for granted; their *rules* are explained but their *origin* is not; (Shadows of the Limelight; Mistborn)
  * Superpowers or magic exist; their rules are not fully explained, but it is clear that *rules exist* and *no established rules are violated without explanation*; (Lord of the Rings and Star Wars actually do this decently well)
  * A villain saves or spares the hero in a way consistent with that villain's character as previously established;
  * A noun (name, place, nation, culture, species, artifact, etc.) or a fact tangential to the plot is mentioned in passing, but never elaborated upon. (Worldbuilding! Yay!)

  Not Okay in ratfic:

  * A character gains a new power in a manner convenient to the plot, but its source is poorly explained;
  * Superpowers or magic exist, and are given an explanation which sounds science-y but is actually bogus; (beware of over-explaining)
  * Superpowers or magic exist, but their rules are vague or fail to be internally consistent;
  * A villain saves or spares the hero in a way inconsistent with that villain's character, motivations, goals, and/or intelligence;
  * A noun *whose existence is central to the plot,* or a fact which sounds like it could massively change things, is introduced but never developed.

  Another good rule of thumb, and possibly a more universal one, is: *Being genre-savvy should not allow me to predict your plot*. If I can predict how a conflict will resolve based on the tropes that led up to it, or if I can predict outcomes based on *what would be the most dramatic*, then your story has irrational gaps.

  I want to hold up Ra as an example of a ratfic that does a good job of explaining its magic without running into "this is obviously fake science." But I had serious problems parsing how the heck it justified nonsense like Tanako's World, so that kind of falls flat. But that's a rant for another day.

    >  A noun whose existence is central to the plot, or a fact which sounds like it could massively change things, is introduced but never developed.

    This is overbroad. Rational fiction does not forbid MacGuffins, and this rule does.
    ```

    - u/LordSwedish:
      ```
      I feel like the only MacGuffins this comes into conflict with are the kinds that are just a valuable thing people want. It's not important to the story what the briefcase in Pulp Fiction is because it's just a valuable thing. Any other MacGuffin I can think of is either developed somewhat or is such a lazy contrivance that it's incompatible with ratfics. 

      A ratfic needs to be about people pursuing their goals, it the plot is just about stopping random hellmouths or something like that, it's going to be really hard to make it a ratfic. The Motherboxes from the Justice League movie come to mind. They are completely unexplained and undeveloped and are the perfect example of a MacGuffin not following the stated rule. They are also widely criticised for being incredibly lazy and I would be shocked to find them in a supposed ratfic.

  Lost is a good example because it was 100% loose end, by design. JJ Abrams calls this a [Mystery Box](https://qntm.org/mystery) and QNTM has a rant about how it is terrible. (Ironically, he then proceeded to make Ra conclude with a Mystery Box.)

  In 1954, JRR Tolkien wrote “As a story, I think it is good that there should be a lot of things unexplained (especially if an explanation actually exists); and I have perhaps from this point of view erred in trying to explain too much, and give too much past history... And even in a mythical Age there must be some enigmas, as there always are.”

  Heh, that was hilarious to me. I just knew there were nerds out there trying to piece everything together as though it were some kind of brilliant puzzle, while it was apparent they were just making stuff up all along. Not even a scrap of a plan or an outline was put into those scripts - it was all about expensive razzle dazzle padded out with cheap low cost off-island sequences.

  I had a hearty guffaw when the last episode dropped and it was like "it was Jesus all along".

  There's a talk on youtube where Abrams talks about his "mystery box" trick that he uses way too much. It was a perfect metaphor for the entire affair - a man standing on a stage behind an empty box with nothing inside of it.

  It's exploitative of human psychology, a bit like how gacha games prey on addiction. Because literally anything could be in the box since it's completely arbitrary, it's very much like a slot machine to the viewer.

  Prison Break, where the protagonist was always five seconds away from obliteration every single commercial break, is a slightly different sort of cheap repetitive trick to keep the viewer's attention. I don't honestly think enrapturing these base urges of our lizard brains with these kinds of techniques is in-line with rational fiction.

- u/Geminii27:
  ```
  I'd feel that minor questions would be OK to leave hanging in the interests of keeping the story moving and on-track. As long as the author's thought about them and could answer the inevitable questions later (ratfic fans absolutely loving to question every corner of a universe), and the answers wouldn't blow a hole in the plot or the story's society or character backstories.
  ```

- u/Pacific_Rimming:
  ```
  It's one thing to ask "Is it possible to answer every question?" and "Should we try to answer every question?"

  For the first one it's impossible. It's like with a child asking "Why?" over and over to every explanation. "Why is the sky green in Algalax?" Because of the different gasous contents of the athmosphere." "Why?" "Partly pollution, partly because the planet is made from different major elements compared to Earth." 

  Already we have to diverge the questioning and talk about the industry of Algalax and it's geology. The writer can only repeat this why game so far, so I propose that you just accept that you're human and write what you like.

  If you wrote a book to talk about alien biology and want to handwave how the FTL travel works, feel free! Thousands of other writers have already answered that question, I don't need to read the same rehashed shit for ten pages. (If you have a unique take on FTL though, you do you.)

  Regarding "Should we try to answer every question?" I have some personal advice: When you're conflicted between choosing 2 different explanations for a thing, that are both equally valid and interesting - just leave it open-ended!

  Remember to leave sufficient clues for the reader though. Trust me, sometimes the reader is smarter than you and you can create some interesting debates this way, if you give both sides sufficient ammunition. You can even show these debates in-universe.

  "Algalax has always had a green sky." "Nonsense, we need to make our industry more environmental friendly." Wow, now you have literal green house politics as background worldbuilding AND you can throw some political satire in there.
  ```

- u/myriadamant:
  ```
  Late to the discussion but hope this adds something worthwhile. As a reader, I can only take your story seriously if I think it takes itself seriously. Now, not every story has to be taken seriously (e.g. HPMOR seems more interested in having the ideas taken seriously) but I suspect most ratfic authors want their readers to be immersed in their worlds and invested in the fates of their characters. As such, I want to know that you're not just making stuff up as you go along willy-nilly, that you're taking your stuff seriously. To have an answer for all the questions big and small gives me the impression that you have at least considered these questions. Whether those answers are good ones... well that is always subjective.
