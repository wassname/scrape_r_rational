  I also loved this book. There's just so many interesting *things* on every freaking *page*. But more than sheer idea-richness, this book has believable characters, although it isn't bent on presenting the whole story as a puzzle that can be solved. It's dark hard sci fi done very well.

  I love this book, but not in a rationalist fiction way. However, this is a very good Sci-Fi and my favorite existential horror to date. 

  Also, — I suspect many of us will find this amusing — this book is an apt example of a story which could not be reduced to [savanna poetry](http://lesswrong.com/lw/oq/savanna_poets/) without it losing all of it's impact.
