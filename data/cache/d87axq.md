  Say, it is worth reading now? I've read first book and was impressed by the first half and very dissatisfied with the second. Too much badly explained plots from too many people with the unclear motivation. Also characterisation at the start of the second book was just abhorrent, it's like no one lived through events of the first book. Did it get any better?

    I opened up the comments to make this specific question. Thanks for beating me to it.
