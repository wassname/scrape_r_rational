  Mirror Knight is the Armsmaster content I've been missing.

  hey, I just started your story (currently starting book 2) ans I have to say, I'm loving it so far. Very good world, interesting characters (especially Catherine), and interesting good/evil rules with characters being more greys.

  I'm genuinely scared for the secondary characters during the big fights, hope the pixie won't eat the dust

    Glad to see you've joined in on reading. I quite honestly think this is the best web serial being written right now among a field of extremely strong contenders.

      What else is good? Looking for recommendations. I've been reading a bunch but right now feeling kinda drained. Unlike real books most web serials tend to just drone on with nothing really happening. They don't have a planned arc with an end.

        If you go back to recent stuff, Worm is the gold standard for many and recently finished its sequel Ward. Mother of Learning also recently came to a fantastic conclusion.

        For ongoing works, I'm a *huge* fan of The Wandering Inn, but it definitely has no ending in sight. It does have pretty clear arcs though I feel.

        Vacant Throne is a lesser known one, I think, and definitely feels like it's wrapping towards a conclusion. Excellent piece, I really like the author's other works too.

        I recently read Homicidal Aliens are Invading and All I Got is This Stat Menu, which I thought was fairly well written and has just one book fully written; the author dropped it shortly into book 2, so you can stop at the epilogue for a satisfying conclusion.

        Metaworld Chronicles is a long one with fairly decent narrative separation. I had a lot of problems in the beginning with it feeling like pure male fantasy, but the editing has helped that a lot and the worldbuilding is quite excellent. Still has a bit of a Mary Sue feel.

        Super Minion hasn't gotten far enough that it feels it's dragging and the author's stated he has a clear ending planned. I adore this story.

        Worth the Candle is acclaimed and has a lot of work and attention to detail in it. I took a break when I caught up to it at chapter 100 and haven't started back up (it's at 200-something now). The depth of mechanics involved gets hard to keep up with at times, imo.

        Everybody Loves Large Chests is a bit of a guilty pleasure of mine as it's unashamed in its power fantasy and sexual content but very neat in terms of worldbuilding. And recently finished, come to think of it.

        The Daily Grind is also quite a decent story if you like a more modern aesthetic as a change from all the typical fantasy pieces.

        And that's all I've got off the top of my head and my royalroad follow list. Hopefully some good stuff in there.

          I've actually read almost all of those. I gave up on the wandering inn at some point because I realized that it was never going to end and I didn't particularly care about the current arc (something about a crazy clown?). 

          Everybody loves large chests had too much of a sexual nature for my tastes, I don't want to read about the female demon disgorging a cock from somewhere and aggressively fucking the other female demon.

          Homicidal aliens was good when I last read it but there wasn't much of it and super minion is great. 

          I've never heard of vacant throne and I've heard some good things about the daily grind. Thanks!

            I think the crazy clown arc was two updates and has not had a chapter since.  I think it was more for the purpose of introducing rhir and the earthers there then anything else.  The story is making forward progress, even if the majority of the charters dont know the end goal. >! spoilers: I think its pretty obvious the end goal is the sleeping god !<

              I stopped at the second one. My disinterest had been building for a while and it was exam season. I just never picked it back up, maybe it's time to again.
              ```

      - u/CouteauBleu:
        ```
        *Animorphs The Reckoning* is fifty-fifty on planning (like, it clearly has a planned ending, but it takes some *wild* tangents to get there), but it's pretty great in terms of "things really happening"; the status quo changes *fast*, and it always feels like the protagonists are working towards a new pressing goal.
        ```

      - u/PastafarianGames:
        ```
        Ward just ended! So if you've already read Worm, that's always a solid option. As are Wildbow's other works, Pact and Twig.

        Mother of Learning ended recently, so that one's done and wrapped up.

        Oh, and if you're a Tamora Pierce fan, go read Lady Knight Volant.

          I read worm and it was great! Started ward and haven't gotten far yet. I saw a giant flogging of it that makes me feel misgivings about getting too invested in it.
          ```

          - u/PastafarianGames:
            ```
            I probably know the giant flogging of it that you speak of and personally think it can fuck right off. If you're enjoying it, read it. If you stop enjoying it, well, probably stop reading it.
            ```

              ```
              I get what your saying, but some stories you have to slog a bit before it gets good, or they have slow parts.
              ```

              - u/PastafarianGames:
                ```
                Ward is a character drama about trauma and healing. If by the time you're a couple arcs in you don't care about the characters, I'd recommend bailing.
                ```

                - u/ironistkraken:
                  ```
                  I was thinking of other stories.  For me I really had to purposefully read parts of mother of learning.
                  ```
