  ```
  The comments below the story are clearly written by the author. They all have the same diction and are all generically positive.

  ```
  This isn't particularly rational fiction, primarily because nobody in the story is solving a problemâ€”the only real agent is the shouting lady, whose only real action is to get randomly angry.
