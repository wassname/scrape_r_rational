    Reformulating the question for /r/rational:

    You are the first sentient in your light cone to gain access to a working time machine.  What actions do you take to optimize the percentage of realizable futures in which you and/or your Ascended Self are omnipotent?

      Does a light cone still make sense after time travel is introduced?

        I'm assuming that the optimizing actions include maintaining exclusive access to time travel technology.  So light cone restrictions still apply to potential competitors.

        The sort of time machine that we aren't entirely sure is prevented by physical law can only allow you to go back in time to the moment it was created and hence has a light cone it's limited to.  Which then, of course, becomes *your* light cone.

    Well, the challenge as I understand it includes not taking any other present technology "you must obtain world domination through killing only, not by bringing an iPhone back to the Middle Ages or wowing them with your time machine."

    Of course, you can take KNOWLEDGE, which is certainly more valuable than 8 damned bullets.

      Assuming the time machine goes to the past (which is impossible, according to current knowledge) there's revolvers there as well. Taking one with me may be slightly more convenient, but then the task could also say "you get a time machine and some shoes".

      You can also just take whatever weapons or tools you want from anywhere/anywhen. Time machine your ass back before they built that armory, then hurry up and wait, then hurry up and wait backwards, then go on your way with your new armaments.

          Given that we're talking time machines, travel back to the mid-19th century and threaten a barely-tolerated domestic servant of a large household with introducing the concept to a local manufacturer, thus setting off a chain of events resulting in making the other servants able to clean faster and the threatenee redundant.

            Feather dusters have been around a lot longer than that, and you could threaten servants from before that far more effectively with practically anything else.

                Huh. I thought they had to be older than that.

                Anyway, the idea that mass production of feather dusters would result in mass layoffs of servants doesn't seem too coherent anyway, and the real way to threaten those people is with the mass production of automated kitchen implements and vaccum cleaners coupled with a change in culture which made doing chores fashionable for the well-to-do again.

  Seems almost too easy. Rule lawyering answer would be to teleport past the heat death of the universe, at which point you win by default. Other fun strategies include duplicating yourself, though this depends on the specific implementation of time travel, and automating your time travel device to go back in time by ɛ seconds every ɛ seconds, such that time is effectively frozen for everyone else, though again this depends on the limitations of the tool.

  Assuming this isn't parallel-worlds time travel where you venture to alternate timelines, and assuming that the machine isn't magically unique: *You are not the only person with a time machine*.

  As soon as a time machine exists in a single-timeline universe then there is *already* a secret society of time travelers with rules and traditions that have somehow sustained the history we know and love and protected it from looking any different than it does the moment you gain access to the theoretical opportunity to change it. Even if you've only just invented it.

  Everybody who comes after you can still act before you... and have. You are already in opposition to them, and working against their entire society and millions of years of experience.

  Being the theoretical first to come into possession only matters for relatively petty historical reasons. Otherwise it's an enormous disadvantage.

    > Assuming this isn't parallel-worlds time travel where you venture to alternate timelines, and assuming that the machine isn't magically unique: _You are not the only person with a time machine._

    If you're not the only person with a time machine, and it's possible to change the past, then the time machine will never be invented... because para-eventually someone will undo the invention of the time machine every time it's invented. This applies to any organization dedicated to maintaining the course of history, no matter how good they are.

    Basically, only a timeline in which the time machine is never invented is a steady state condition. The timeline will keep changing until such a state is reached, and then stop changing. From the point of view of people anchored in the timeline, that's how it always was.

    So this question kind of implies either that you're the only person with a time machine, or the time machine can't go back before its own creation.
    ```

    - u/Sparkwitch:
      ```
      The other end of that is that if you've invented a time machine, then you'll have always invented a time machine. The organization doesn't have to be good, they need only aspire to: They've got all of eternity to make things work right... and they have unimpeachable evidence that, in the end, they succeeded.

      If an apparent change ever gets corrected, it's not actually a change. It's just the way things always were. The timeline never changes at all.

      To steal from [Heinlein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_You_Zombies):

      *A Paradox May be Paradoctored.*

      *Never Do Yesterday What Should Be Done Tomorrow.*

      *If at Last You Do Succeed, Never Try Again.*

        >  other end of that is that if you've invented a time machine, then you'll have always invented a time machine.

        That's not a stable state. The butterfly effect means that it is literally mathematically impossible, even with infinite time, to create a stable timeline that contains any loops. All You Zombies is great science fiction but it's not actually science.

        You need something like [Leiber's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Time) law of conservation of history to damp out the entropy in the loops.

      This needs justifying. It seems to me that there could be stable states with time travel. Chaos theory / "for want of a nail" means it's ludicrously difficult to change the past without changing the circumstances that led to you changing the past, but not literally impossible. (Or things might infinitely converge towards a stable state, which amounts to the same thing.)

        The timeline is incredibly fragile once you insert actual physics into the analysis. If you make any change in the past significantly before your birth, down to even scaring an animal near you when you appear, you will pretty much guarantee you're never going to be born.

        The reason is hydrodynamics of seminal fluid.

        This is a massive amplifier of change. You scare an animal, it behaves slightly differently, a few animals nearby change THEIR behaviour very slightly as a result, and the next time one of them mates that happens slightly differently, even if it's just a fraction of a second later, and completely different sperm reach the egg.

        SO in that area, a different set of animals is born in the next generation. Over their lives they behave differently, and the changes grow.

        If this is before humanity evolved, if that even happens it'll happen completely differently. The new history will be completely different from the get go. If it's only a few centuries ago, maybe it'll take twenty or thirty years before a hunter catches or doesn't catch an animal, and ends up making out with her husband a fraction of a second later the next night, and now all their children are different.

        And humans are an amplifier of entropy. Within a generation the very slight changes have spread all over the planet, completely different people are born, and the timeline is completely different. All from a snap of a twig as your time machine touched down.

        MAYBE if it was before Lief Erikson, the new world gets a few generations repreive, but even then... migrating animals and fish also spread changes across the globe.

        The idea of going back and making a deliberate, limited change is nonsense. It can't be done.

        Converging on a stable state, sure, but the most likely stable state to converge on is one in which the time machine is never invented. There's no *mechanism* directing the creation of almost closed loops that converge over multiple iterations. It would have to happen all at once, by sheer chance, and there still would have to be no time travel ever outside that one unlikely loop. SO even if there's a loop, it's one in which the time machine gets used once and prevents itself from ever being used again... and that is just so much less likely than it simply undoing itself I can't believe in any other result.

    This is one of my favorite aspects of Haddix as an author (author of the *Shadow Children* series). Even if she's not rational at all, or even particularly historically accurate, the protagonists in her time-travel series aren't the only time-travelers. In fact, there exist two competing factions of time travelers, that only recently diverged (but have, in effect, been competing throughout the whole of history).

    I especially like the way it goes about paradoxes - the natural form of the universe *without* time travel is predestined, and any changes from the norm will generally revert, unless they are too large. It's really weird and not too consistent, but it was a nice brain-bender for me as a young adult.
