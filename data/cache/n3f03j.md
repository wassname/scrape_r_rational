  It's very interesting how Joon has begun referring to Arthur as Uther even in internal narration; the DM corrected him to "Arthur" in Hellfall, and here he thinks to himself "Somewhere in there, Uther lay ahead of us.".

  Speaking of Arthur, he's spent something like 500 years inside Long Stairs. That's a lot of time to spend reflecting on American jingoism in the middle east, and I eagerly await his conclusions.
  ```

  - u/CreationBlues:
    ```
    To be fair, Arthur and Uther are very different people. Arthur is his teenage friend, Uther is his teenage friend +20-30 years and far more world weary. Keeping the two separate is probably wise, even if the DM has a personal perspective.

    You die a second time when your name is forgotten, and putting everything into a vorpal sword _really_ kills. I think that's the implication from the text, at least.
    ```

    - u/wren42:
      ```
      I felt that the memetics effect of mome rath was involved as well. I liked the hack, layering powerful effects with onion's sword mimicking vorpal enhanced with bethel plus mome rath bone. I think all layers were necessary to get the job done.
      ```

      - u/absolute-black:
        ```
        AW said on discord that Mome Rath's effect wasn't intended to be part of it, but it doesn't contradict the text so it's a valid theory/interpretation anyway.
        ```

  - u/ketura:
    ```
    I took it as "overdamage". Which is to say, that normally the most you could possibly drain yourself for the Vorpal Blade was 100%, but the sheer weight of the Mome Rath bones let him pour 10,000% of his strength in instead (and crucially, not all of it sourced from him himself).

    So if 10% of Joon's own formidable life force was enough to smear an avatar of Fel Seed, and (say) 1000% of himself was enough to actually kill Fel Seed the person, then 10,000% of himself was so much overkill it spilled over into erasing the very idea of Fel Seed.

    Either that or something something mixing in the antimemetic effects of the Mome Rath life force into the Vorpal Blade altered its effects. Perhaps burning Unicorn bones while killing a lesser being would retroactively remove it from history.
    ```

    AW actually commented about it on the discord:  
     `Partly in response to earlier discussion, it's foreshadowed twice in the chapter "The Fel Seed Incident", 228:` 

    >`“If you remember when you set out to get the sword,” I said, knowing that they had probably forgotten, “You were told that it was the sword that brought low creatures and men of myth.

Supposedly it killed King Hal in a duel the very moment it touched him — not even breaking skin, just grazing the layer of wax that his armor was polished with. And of the Rilchiam, the less said, the better.”  “Dead though, right?” asked Tom.  “There are fates worse than death,” I replied. “And deaths so final they’re hard to speak of.”`

    I feel like the narrative answer is "DM Fiat to metaphorically excise what Fel Seed represented from Joon's psyche". It's telling that he specifically couldn't avoid the vorpal strike; I'm not sure if it's the only thing that could ever have worked on him, but it feels like ending the fight with it was what "needed to happen"

    As for the in-story explanation, it honestly might be all three. The idea of Fel Seed being unbeatable might need to be slain in order to beat him, and the vorpal blade might allow the Mome Rath antimemetic properties to propagate into where they needed to be in order to handle that.

    ...come to think of it, burning the Mome Rath bone should have given Joon himself antimemtic properties, right? That seems...curiously absent from the whole affair.

      Not necessarily, if Joon doesn't actively want it to. You can drain specific stats out of bones. Draining abilities is an extra feature.
      ```

      - u/ThatEeveeGuy:
        ```
        Ah, fair enough.

        Although this does raise the question of whether antimemetics would even WORK on Fel Seed.
        ```

    - u/eltegid:
      ```
      Mome Rath's antimemetic power only worked at a distance, didn't it?
      ```

      - u/CouteauBleu:
        ```
        The Mome Minions living in its ecosystem had short-range antimemetic effects, though, so whatever criteria decides the properties that can be extracted from Mome Rath bones might count those as well.
        ```

    - u/Tarhish:
      ```
      Yeah, they noted that FS returned even after all life was gone from the zone, and they just sort of accepted that it was bullshit. But, it's possible FS is capable of regrowth from *memes*.  Mome Rath is the anti-memelord, and FS is the memelord.
      ```

  - u/GlimmervoidG:
    ```
    I don't think he's a meme exactly. 

    As I speculated below, I don't think he is the biomanipulation exclusion. Rather, his exclusion is about fear and drawing power from people's fear - all your inner dark shit. Body horror was just how he did that.

    Joon created Fel Seed in the real world to deal with his grief. Fel Seed was a manifestation of that grief. 

    This Fel Seed is the same. As long as people remember him he can regenerate form the fear and despair and depression he germinates in their hearts. 

    Someone, likely Amaryllis, realised this and set up the antimeme. Defeat Fel Seed and then wipe away all knowledge of him and he can't come back.

    The line between this and being a meme is narrow but I think the difference is there is/was a real Fel Seed and the magic was about drawing power from people's fear rather than being it.
    ```

    - u/DaystarEld:
      ```
      I like this one; he's like an IT creature, a cultural narrative bogeyman, and thus the only way to permanently kill him is to erase him from everyone's memory.
      ```

  - u/CouteauBleu:
    ```
    My first assumption was Mome Rath, followed by the Vorpal Blade. I don't think the third is likely.
    ```

  - u/ludichrisness:
    ```
    >So what caused the antimemetic effect on FS?

    My head canon is that Mome Rath and this antimemetic effect of the Vorpal Sword are part of the same magical phenomenon which is related to the briefly mentioned magic of Carrollism. Carrollism is one of the possible magics that Juniper thinks of when trapped in the illusion exclusion at Speculation and Scrutiny, and antimemetic magic could certainly cause some of the same effects. Mome Rath and the vorpal sword are obviously connected to the Jabberwocky poem, as is Fel Seed (A Manxome Foe). I think it's also tied in to Juniper's comments during the Mome Rath chapter about finding an idea that unified and tied together the idea of the vorpal sword in his Jabberwocky Cinematic Universe - he said that the idea of "cutting off the head" is scarier than it seems, and this kind of fate where all memory of you is destroyed, seems thematically appropriate.
    ```

  - u/archpawn:
    ```
    I think it's a combination of the Mome Rath's bone and the fact that he was trying to thoroughly cut through even the very concept of FS.
    ```

  - u/Executioner404:
    ```
    I actually thought it was 2 at first, but your idea for 3 makes a surprising amount of sense!     
    Fel Seed as a meme for "The Ultimate Evil" - unbeatable, immortal, unfathomably cruel, nigh omnipotent yet sealed in a box.

    Honestly, for such a comparatively 'simple' victory (just cut him with the sword ezpz) - there's a surprising number of variables for what actually caused this time to work, beyond DM fiat.
    ```

  - u/chris-goodwin:
    ```
    > Was Fel Seed a meme, (hence allowing to return in the Library timelines and this one just like Figaro Finch, and also giving a bridge between Joon's creation of Fel Seed on earth and Fel Seed's origins on Aerb), and thus any true destruction of Fel Seed would necessarily occur at the memetic level?

    This was my theory.  We saw Figaro Finch return from death, and to me it seemed that this was suspiciously similar to how Fel Seed was described as returning from death.  IMO the reason why Joon was able to kill him was because of drawing from Mome Rath (who?) bones, with their antimemetic effect.

    Love that.

    I'll raise it even higher: Fel Seed never actually cheated, he just *also* had an enormous cache of synergistic and abusable entads, all touching a small fragment of his body in a hidden vault impervious to all known forms of destruction...

    But anti-matter wasn't known.

    Or maybe that'll just be the DMs excuse for the nerf. "It's not like i wanted you to win or anything!"
    ```

    - u/ActualSpamBot:
      ```
      He's probably keeping the various bound-entad bearers "alive" deep underground to prevent entad divestiturance.  That, plus incorporating enough of their bodies into himself that the entads consider him a valid user.
      ```

    - u/GET_A_LAWYER:
      ```
      Fel Seed killed thousands well equipped combatants in the attacks against him, he has to have access to thousands of entads by now.
      ```

    - u/CouteauBleu:
      ```
      Yeah, that was a thought I had as well.

      Joon assumes that he's cheating, but early on he has a glimpse at Fel Seed's true nature, as a Death-Star-like giant organic factory and weapons platform.

      Given that fact, and the huge number of entads Fel Seed would have at its disposal, *and* the fact they're explicitly never harming it as much as blowing up the puppets it sends at them while hoping it humors them for long enough...

      Saying that it cheats might be a bad assessment. Rather, it's like a larger-scale version of Bethel, where it has so many tools and super-powerful techniques accumulated over the centuries (maybe even something like in the DFEZ, where it breeds generation of mages of various categories to unlock new powers) that anybody taking its superficial form at face value would interpret what it's *actually* able to do as diabolus ex machina bullshit.

      (eg we see in an alternate timeline that the Fifth Empire tried to raze the zone to the bedrock, and nuke Thousand Brides... but it's possible FS just had backup "facilities" under the bedrock, or in other dimensions, etc)
      ```

    Fel Seed could only ever be defeated by the most wholeome thing Joon created in his time DMing. And in Ropey's absence, using his wife would have to be reasonable enough.

  - u/archpawn:

    I don't think there is one solution. Originally, any weakness you try to exploit would be retconned away. Once the DM stops stepping in, anything that hasn't been retconned away still works.
    ```

- u/foveros:
  ```
  So kids, have you ever been stabbed so hard you turned into an antimeme?

  Toad son is precious and his smile must be protected at all costs.

  Agree with Amaryllis, fel seed is literally impossible to kill unless they lose to him first. Anything they tried in the first run wouldn't work, anything they tried in this that would seem like a smart enough idea, would. And did.

  New posting schedule really helps with discussion. A compromise, since you seem to prefer writing large batches, would be to write a batch and release it one or two chapters at a time like this over the course of a week.

  > I counted us lucky, very lucky that Amaryllis hadn’t lost all her inherited entads when she’d died, since there was no known precedent for what happened when you brought someone back from the dead.

  It's not valid precedent as it doesn't involve the Hells at all, but I wonder how entad inheritance works for renacim. Do they inherit permissions from their bioparents? Do they keep permissions from their previous incarnations? Do they lose them, but regain them when they age into the age-band they had the permission in?

      Depends whether you consider the Climax to be part of the Endgame. We're in the Denouement now, would be more precise.

        Exactly, hence the total time being 3 years and 3 days. I'm sure that's intentionally symbolic.

  So... Is Fel Seed actually dead then? If so, that felt really wrong. I like how they won, it meshes, but it felt so much less dangerous than before. In the last fight it felt like every second spent fighting was a second spent in imminent death; he was one shotting invincible wards faster than people could perceive. He was killing people during the loops constantly but this time, he slashes at Raven and she survives? I mean he punches Pallida in the head, and she lives. This is the same guy who squeezed real hard and started breaking something inviolable. Iunno, it was almost like the GM turned down the difficulty.

      ```
      FS also attributed his relatively lacking victory last time to the locus, which was not present this go around, so he may have been taking it easy on them / overconfident / savoring the moment / curious about them potentially opening the door.

      I'd note that FS only punches Pallida *after* she finishes her work on the door.

      The fact that the door opened at all was definitely DM fiat, but FS probably didn't understand that and expected to take control of the door after the party opened it.
      ```

- u/CronoDAS:
  ```
  I had a horrible idea.

  What if the reason that Juniper lost his game interface is that *he's still in the hells* and the device that lets someone "escape" just turns an Aerb soul into a copy of someone who died?
  ```

  - u/archpawn:
    ```
    I've seen someone predicted that in an earlier thread. Does it really matter. It's just one more soul in the hells.

    I feel like they'd have noticed when the first person tried to use the device. Though I guess it might be like a Star Trek transporter, where it tears you apart to scan you and send out the copy, and because of how the Omega Hell works they just reform somewhere else.
    ```

    - u/Flammkuchenmann:
      ```
      I highly doubt thats how it would work. There would be too much potential for munchkinry.
      Imagine Joon's (or any other party members) "stay back in hell" copy going to the portal again and again...
      Multiple copies of Amy (without powers) are already world changing, multiple powered party members would just be too much.

        Quote for convenience, from Chapter 26, when Juniper and Fenn return to Barren Jewel after the Caer Laga excursion and entad mechanics come up:

        > Heirloom entads were inextricably tied to the people who had inherited them, and they couldn't be divested of them by anything short of death. This had all the obvious knock-on effects you would expect, like incentive to kill someone with a lot of heirlooms if you were the next in line, and a concentration of power in the hands of the few, and all kinds of other things like that. Worse, there was a grace period between when entads were created and when they became bound to a person or a line, which meant that entads concentrated in the hands of people with power and money, helping to create solid dynasties like the one that Amaryllis was a part of. In his lifetime, Uther Penndraig had amassed a huge quantity of them, one which the Lost King's Court had been the beneficiaries of. **Strangely, and as one of the grand and impossible things that Uther had made his stock and trade, he had untethered himself from his stockpile before his long trip, leaving everyone ever after wondering whether he had ever truly died, or whether he would return to Anglecynn in its time of need.**

    You're assuming that the DM is special in some way that the Layman isn't. My assumption is that the guy in the sweatshirt is just another convenient way to interface with the system but doesn't accurately reflect any sort of secret truth about the universe any more than the game layer throwing up error messages indicates that the universe actually runs the risk of a null pointer exception. They're all part of the same creation that includes Earth and Bumblefuck, Kansas.

      I am, yeah; the whole thing makes the most sense to me that way, in the sense that there's SOME animating intelligence behind the whole thing (even if it is just Joon's subconscious and/or typical thought processes being extrapolated and put to purpose by...something) and if we're going to refer to that as something it may as well be the something with a face that we're familiar with. He seems to be nominally "in charge" of the whole process.

      That said, thinking of the whole shebang as essentially a convenient display device for something much more abstract is honestly something I hadn't considered before now and makes a lot of sense. I suppose in that case even the "other entities" might not really be a thing so much as representations that will pop in and out when a specific manner of interface is required.

      The only quibble I have is the DM at one point stating that he leaves some things to the Architect; this does imply a certain level of mental coherence/separation on their part, although if we consider the extrapolation thing above to have formed "a mind" that is managing Aerb, the DM could just be (or represent) the conscious, directing part of it.

  Honestly, I'm kind of dissappointed with how they killed Fel Seed. I don't know what I was expecting the solution to be, but "hitting him even harder" feels like a letdown. Yes, I know the DM wasn't letting him cheat this time, and yes, I know the vorpal sword is a special weapon that kills things really hard, but still. There was all that build up, we had the first attempt to demonstrate the futility of the direct approach, we had the DM outright saying that Fel Seed's weakness was the existence of the DM, and what does it all amount to? The same thing that got them killed the first time, except now it works.

  I'm still enjoying the story and I'm eager to see where things go with the Long Stairs, but I'm not a big fan of this chapter. It's just unsatisfying.

    FS was always going to be a weird fight because he has the power to cheat any cute solution you painstakingly come up with.

    ```

  - u/Flammkuchenmann:
    ```
    My theory is as following:
    FS was unbeatable during Joons real life campaign, because he as a DM could just make up any power he wanted to, to counter the players actions.

    FS in Aerb operated the same way. The DM could just retroactively give FS abilitys and preparations to beat anything they would bring against him.

    When Joon died, the DM left the game. so FS would get no new abilities when needed  and there was no more DM cheating than previously established. That way, they could beat FS by using a new approach.
    I'm quite sure the "clone Vorpal Blade" strategy wouldn't have worked on their first try.

    "The same thing that got them killed the first time, except now it works" is literally Fel Seed's one weakness (that there is an entity above him). Joon successfully appealed to the DM to modify the game mechanics so that this would be the case.

      I get that, but that still means the answer was just finding a way to hit him very hard. It still makes Fel Seed feel like just another boss monster, where up to this point he'd been presented as both a statement on the nature of the "game" and an indictment of Juniper's character.

      Regardless of what explanations you can give for why things worked out this time, however much the in-universe mechanics of it all might make sense, on an out-of-universe level this chapter completely ignored what made Fel Seed interesting. This fight wasn't meaningfully different from the fight with Mome Rath or Onion when I feel like it really should have been. I get it if I'm in the minority on this, I just needed to get it out there.
      ```

      - u/CrystalShadow:

        That’s fair enough, and I think even in text it’s been clear that it is narratively tricky to write out of the hole of an invincible monster. I wouldn’t say that it’s “just” copying the sword, but that the answer would never show up unless the proper character development occurred.

        I’m as satisfied as I think I could be, which is considerably less than I was for the DFEZ, but I can’t think of a better solution for this one than we got, with the current setup.

            ```
            I think the problem is that it feels unconnected. Yes they earned it by literally coming back from hell to make it for a round 2, but the party barely changed up their approach to Fel Seed. It feels like they didn't learn from their last fight and just completely relied on the DM nerfing Fel Seed to guarantee a win. Even though it worked out, it still feels slightly unsatisfying.

            It probably would have been better if Juniper and co had learned or found something in the hells to directly use in the fight to make the hell-diving an integral component to the solution instead of relying purely on narrative to secure the win.
            ```

            - u/gramineous:
              ```
              I agree with you about the scene feeling unconnected, but I think the events themselves have been getting less and less important in WtC than the narrative has. I mean, Fel Seed is here literally not as the big bad, despite how much he was built up over the series, but as a stepping stone because that's not the level that Joon and co are operating at any more. So from a "reader looking at the narrative" rather than the events perspective, to mirror the shift in focus the characters have had, Joon getting rid of the person he once was and being better than he used to be (as was bought up in the chat with Fenn just last chapter), signified by wiping away the incarnation of his worst moment that he was frequently reminded of and constantly regretted throughout his time on Aerb, this scene works at that level.

              I think the sidequest montage from earlier reinforces this too, as the lack of focus on having scenes that flowed together like earlier parts of the series is because the story as an adventure has taken a backseat to the story as focused on characters, drawn more from their overarching motivations than from their individual actions moment to moment. After like 1.5 million words, we've reached the point of getting an understanding of the characters, as readers, that skipping over the finer details for a larger scale perspective is doable, and fits with the plans of the characters themselves being concerned with the larger scale of their world/s too.

              > I think the problem is that it feels unconnected

              Huh, that makes a lot of sense. I think it also would've been more satisfying if we'd been told about the Onion sword and the Mome bones a chapter earlier, and had time to try figuring it out ourselves. The way it's currently written, it was like they were pulling out parts of the solution during the fight itself. It seems less clever and planned, and more like the DM is just allowing whatever they've got. (Maybe that's the intention? I But it would've been more satisfying if the characters, and the readers, had a chance to mull it over and solve the puzzle.
              ```

      - u/InfernoVulpix:
        ```
        I think the fact that it wasn't so special this time around is the 'fair second chance' they were banking on.  For similar reasons, I think that a Bethel-copied Vorpal Sword would not have worked last time, for one of a variety of reasons.

        The narrative kept mentioning the hope of a fair fight or no cheating the second time around, and that's what this was.  What made Fel Seed special was the unstoppable 'you lose' built into his definition, and once the DM stripped that away he was reduced to 'merely' an overwhelming puzzle boss.

        The disappointment you feel is sorta intentional.  The emotional set-up for a transcendental victory over Fel Seed could only happen if they won according to the original rules, but instead they were handed a different, nerfed, Fel Seed, and even if AW tried for a transcendental emotional victory it would have rang hollow, so he just didn't.

        the first time through WAS different, because he was an invincible narrative monster.  then the GM cut the strings that let him cheat, and a practical rules-hack to gain godlike power worked.

Joon didn't even do anything interesting or clever to convince the DM to change his mind. I kept expecting a clever solution to defeating an invincible monster, but it doesn't seem like they've had a lot of agency in the whole entire thing.

  This means that as long as people remember and fear him, as long as he can exist in peoples mind as an aspect of fear and desperation and grief, he can keep coming back. Per the Infinite Library even from a god confirmed total exclusion wipe.

  So what's the achievement we didn't see here? Gotta imagine the DM had something good. Here's my best attempts: 

  **Achievement Unlocked: Felled**

  **Achievement Unlocked: Seed to gone**

    How convenient that defeating the threat no one remembers lacks an achievement.  


    Maybe the achievement would be *about* that. "Erased from Existence"

      “Unpersoned Exclusion” would’ve been nice

    ```
    **Achievement Unlocked: Redacted!**

    You managed to slay the final boss so hard that the world forgot about it! Too bad that now you'll never know about █████ ███ ███████.

      There is another <REDACTED> exclusion zone, which we never saw. So it would have been a duplicate.

      EDIT: Or now that I think about it, it may have happened behind the scenes and everyone's memory is just <REDACTED>. It doesn't seem fitting to the style of the work, though.

  Fantastic chapter; my satisfaction at seeing various plot points wrapped up and my sadness that it's going to end soon have been at odds all week.

  It seems like the full-power vorpal blade destroys, not just the physical target, but the very *concept* of the target. Seems like that would be an essential part of the "kill everything" sword in a world with memetics. I wonder what the implications of that are in the broader "Juniper's therapy session" metanarrative. 

  I'm curious in upcoming chapters to see how far-reaching the "antimemetic" effect is- will Joon remember the *original* Fell Seed Incident?

    Based on this one-off line:

    > I could remember the session, too, just not the details.

    I'm guessing he remembers all the important bits of the original incident (i.e. how it affected the players and what his role in that was), just not the specific in-campaign events around Fel Seed

  Forced by what? The exclusion? His own nature?
  ```

  - u/Krossfireo:
    ```
    Well, Fel Seed enjoys extracting the maximum pain and fear from his victims. In order to do that, he can't kill them, he's forced instead to bring them to the mere brink of death
    ```

  - u/RidesThe7:
    ```
    I took that to mean that he can't actually kill anyone and bring them back---the best he can do if he wants to keep playing with his food is bring them to the brink of death.
    ```

- u/archpawn:
  ```
  I don't get the idea of trying to use the Vorpal blade against Fel Seed. It's pretty much the most clearly established thing to not work. He shouldn't have been worried about using a copy. That's important. The Vorpal blade might be capable of harming Fel Seed, but it's not willing. An inferior copy is less likely capable of harming him, but it at least might be willing to.
  ```

  - u/GET_A_LAWYER:
    ```
    The true Vorpal Blade won't harm Fel Seed because Fel Seed is the Vorpal Blade's master. (Edit: Maybe wrong.) Joon was using another sword, bound to him, that copied the powers of the Vorpal Sword.

    Fel Seed didn't have immunity to the Vorpal power, he had the loyalty of the (a, now) Vorpal Sword, which is different.
    ```

    - u/archpawn:
      ```
      That's what ended up happening, but it sounded like that was Plan B. And that he was less confident he could kill Fel Seed with a duplicate.
      ```

      - u/GET_A_LAWYER:
        ```
        True. Technically we don't know if attacking Fel Seed with the original Vorpal Sword would work. It didn't work last time, but maybe that's just because Joon didn't sacrifice enough life force.
        ```

        - u/archpawn:
          ```
          In the original tabletop game, the character sacrificed all but one hitpoint and it didn't help. It's unlikely that it's different for Fel Seed. Though I supposed the fact that it did something suggests it's different than in the original game.
          ```
