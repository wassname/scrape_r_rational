  Maybe The Count of Monte Cristo. I especially like when he is in prison and is gleaning as much information as possible from the old man to eventually exact his revenge. When the opportunity arises to escape he has a good plan on how to fool the guards.

      I've seen the movie and read the book. The movie has a "good" ending where he gets back with Mercedes and loves happily ever after. I definitely prefer the book not only because of that but because it's able to give you more details and his thoughts rather than just his actions.

  Primer

  Circle (not The Circle) - not the movie itself, but the victor is a brilliant rationalist both in arguments and actions

  10 Cloverfield Lane - MEW is the smartest horror-movie protag I've ever witnessed, and John Goodman is actually extremely well set-up for the apocalypse
  ```

    I'll second Circle. It's a good example of a bunch of people in a room talking to each other and trying to do some game theory and philosophical arguments. (I give it some leeway for not really answering the bigger question, since it worked for me as a character drama.)
    ```

    - u/LazarusRises:

      I've watched it three or four times now. Amazing how it makes 90 minutes of talking heads so interesting. And following the victor's logical path gets more satisfying on every rewatch.

    I think one of the great points about Primer is how, despite the protagonists acting rationally, they are wrong. 

    Primer seems convoluted if you assume the time travel works the way the protagonists think it does. However, in reality they got it wrong. 

    I feel like shit because I can't find the article, but I read a really good breakdown of how there are some rules of the time travel that the protagonists don't understand. I think it's a great film where the idea is having a rationalist piece of fiction where the characters are still in the dark.

    Also checkout [The Vault](https://www.youtube.com/user/VaultShow), a web series by the same creators of Circle.

    Will second 10 Cloverfield Lane. I immediately thought of this community while watching some of her scenes figuring out how to win in her situation.

  The protagonist in [Twisted, by Team Starkid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-77cUxba-aA), is a rationalist. Check it out.
  ```

    I'm about 15 minutes into it, it's very funny. 

    Edit: I finished watching it and I revise my opinion from very funny to really very funny, I am usually not one for musicals but Starkid stuff is really good.

      I found out about them because somebody else posted about it in a similar thread here a year ago.

    ```
    This was super entertaining and made the better part of a long dull drive pretty enjoyable. Any similar recommendations?

      Same group recently released [Firebringer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmVuNlu0LCk&). It takes place in the stone age and is about the discovery of fire. The protagonist is something of an inventor. When I backed it on Kickstarter I thought it wouldn't be very interesting, but I did it anyway because I like the group. The result was amazing.

      A very potter musical is also good but I don't know if there are any good recordings.

        They all are in youtube! Or were when I watched them.

          I am trying to find one that's not divided into individual five minute videos.

          Edit: found [it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdNKa0W6CK0)!

  ```
  Die Hard, the first one. The bad guy had a well thought-out plan that included the police response, all the things John finds are used and don't feel contrived, and each character can listen in to each other on the radio so communications have to be careful.
  ```

- u/Calsem:
  ```
  [12 angry men](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050083/).  It's a classic.

  Is Primer rational?

  I ask this not to cast doubt on your opinion, but because I watched that movie like five times and I still don't feel like I understand it enough to judge.

      I don't think the story should count as internally consistent if it's too confusing and poorly made to figure out what's going on and the fans end up making graphs to explain the story only for there to still be plot holes left over like what happened with the guy from the future that led to them using the fail-safe machine. 

      I also didn't buy the characters' motivations as logical when I finally figured out what they were and I don't recall them actually utilizing creative problem solving. I don't get why people praise this movie so much since I think it makes no sense and ultimately accomplishes nothing with its story.
      ```

    - u/SkeevePlowse:
      ```
      Fair enough.  I fully admit that I don't understand what was going on with Granger to be able to decide if it just happened because the plot required it, but I'll certainly defer the point.
      ```

        Re-watch it with this fan commentary (by the author of Ra). It's very well done.  https://qntm.org/commentary

  - u/mcgruntman:
    ```
    It is, in my opinion. Re-watch it with this fan commentary (by the author of Ra). It's very well done.  https://qntm.org/commentary

    ```
    Oh jeez, frigging *Primer.* I'm practically addicted to weird time shit, and even still I couldn't make heads nor tails of that thing without a guide. @_@
    ```

    - u/SkeevePlowse:
      ```
      Oh yeah.  It was definitely an enjoyable thriller, and I think that it being confusing helped with the atmosphere, but it was one hell of a tangle.
      ```

- u/zejaws:
  ```
  "No Country For Old Men" goes out of it's way to try and be pretty rationally consistent and explain itself. Plus it's a great movie.
  ```

- u/traverseda:
  ```
  The expanse, although not a movie, probably counts.
  ```

- u/michaelkeenan:
  ```
  [Europa Report](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/europa_report/) is a good sci-fi movie, and fits the rational criteria. There are plot points where other scriptwriters would have had the characters do stupid things for drama, but Europa Report doesn't go that direction. When characters conflict, they have good reasons, driven by their beliefs and values, and they approach the disagreements pretty reasonably.
  ```

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    It definitely struck me as "hard" sci-fi - especially after seeing Interstellar shortly beforehand!
    ```

- u/t3tsubo:
  ```
  "Arrival" is rational of you accept the premise that there is no free will and the universe is deterministic
  ```

- u/Schuano:
  ```
  I would argue for the Prestige.  

  Yes, there is one bit of "real magic" in the movie, but everything else is explained and the motives of the characters are rational with the exception of the initial revenge plot, which both pursue in rational ways.  

  Also, it's emphasis on how everything can be explained in a magician's tricks is very, very rationalist.
  ```

  - u/zarraha:
    ```
    The motives of the characters are not even slightly rational.  They are entirely insane and ruin their own lives over magic tricks.

    You get the power to duplicate things and creatures and humans and instead of using it for massive profit and create an economic revolution you use it to commit serial suicide?

    The other guy is slightly less insane but still ruins his own life for one single magic trick.

    Maybe it could be considered rational if we assume they are magic-trick-paperclippers, who only value magic tricks and everything else in the world exists only to serve that purpose.  This is consistent with their behavior, but I hesitate to use the term rational to describe such an inhuman psychology.
    ```

- u/arenavanera:
  ```
  I think it's unusually hard for movies to be rational.  They're under very tight time constraints, which often forces them to skim over obvious plot holes or move the story along by giving someone the idiot ball.  Hollywood movies also have to appeal to an absurdly broad audience if they want to be profitable, which pushes them toward the median taste in plots and hurts their ability to experiment.
  ```

- u/traverseda:
  ```
  "Spectral" on netflix tries.
  ```

- u/Pattern_Is_Movement:
  ```
  I feel like almost any great movie is rational, having trouble thinking of any exceptions. Anything from 2001: Space Odyssey to a film like 'Wild Strawberries' by Bergman.
  ```

      ```
      I personally define great movies by how entertaining they are and my willingness to watch them multiple times.

      Entertainment and rationality definitely aren't mutually exclusive, but   the presence of one doesn't guarantee the presence of the other.
      ```
