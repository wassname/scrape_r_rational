  Uncivil wars seem to be starting. Nastiness ahead!

    ```
    Yes. Extreme nastiness.
    ```

- u/MoralRelativity:
  ```
  So, I'm thinking, now that Akua is about to butcher a bunch of Summer nobles, that the Summer Court *might* be willing to do a deal (with Cat) to get rid of Akua.

    ```
    A duchess of Winter? That would take a lot.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      True death might be enough though.
      ```

- u/JdubCT:
  ```
  That was not quite the chapter I was hoping for. On the plus side two updates a week starting Monday!
  ```

- u/None:
  ```
  I wonder if these news wards Heiresses Dad has developed will work on Cat herself now that she's at least part Fae.
  ```

  - u/MoralRelativity:
    ```
    I think they might.
    ```

    - u/melmonella:
      ```
      Only partially, I imagine.
      ```
