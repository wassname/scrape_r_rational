Pyrebound is a high fantasy serial set in a unique(ly horrible) world.  It updates every Sunday and some people here like it.  A lengthier summary is [here](https://pyrebound.wordpress.com/) and you can start the first installment [here](https://pyrebound.wordpress.com/2019/01/17/one-a-child-of-the-hearth/).

EDIT: for some reason, Reddit is treating this post as invisible for everyone but me.  Editing to try and shake it out of it.

  This is the first time I've seen this post.  I have nothing but praise for your prose, sir.

    Thank you!  We worked it out, there's some sort of goofy glitch and I think I know how to avoid it in the future.
