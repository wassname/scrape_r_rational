  Another great chapter!
  I don't know how you do it but you manage to make reading about anything interesting whether it's looking for forage, setting up a camp or the small social interactions.
  Thanks for writing this!

  Have you thought of creating a glossary page to explain the definitions of all the new words you are introducing? It would help to be able to look up on your site what jake, adze, tannin, and elefant mean. The words that you either modified or words so rarely used that most people don't know them are slightly confusing when I read them for the first time and I keep stopping to Google what they mean.

    That's not a bad idea.  I could also use the same space for a cast of characters.
