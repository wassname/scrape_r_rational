  I'd like to offer this fic up. It's not a pure rationalist fic, but it fits IMO because of how the fic fills the time between the end of the TV series. It takes the dark world that PMMM built, and through pure human ingenuity and organizational work, mainly through the work of [chapter 1 spoiler](#s "the church of Madoka"), results in a world much better off for girls than the series shows, beginning or end. Without removing the costs of power, it almost transforms the world to be unrecognisable, and then throws in an alien antagonist from left field.

  My only complaint is that after the first chapter, the next 8 or so chapters are nearly all catchup, but besides the issue of worldbuilding pacing, it's a wonderful read of tactics set in a brilliantly original setting.

  It's also awesome in how it uses the headcanon that [chapter 3 spoiler](#s "Madoka won't let Homura die"), but doesn't make the consequences story-breaking.

    Wasn't it the MSY that was responsible for most of the changes? The church was only established after the battle of New Athens.

      Good point, I was mixing the two together mentally.

      The MSY restructured the tribalistic behavior of the magical girls into a cohesive whole, while the church spread the story of Homura, giving them a goddess and prophet of sorts.

  I read this recently, very realistic world building.
