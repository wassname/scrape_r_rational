  Pretty good fight against the alien, in showing that fighting an actual, thinking being is going to be a lot more difficult than fighting against mobs.

  I don't know what it is that makes this ratfic thickle me in just the right way. I'm excited every time a new chapter comes out and I find myself thinking about it at weird times.

  Nothing has tickled me just right like this since UNSONG

    I like the author's way of ratcheting up the tension, and also making it clear that Team Human can lose, and that those losses get felt.

    Most of my fun comes from reverse-engineering the game and Tygerion's intentions. There's a lot of implied stuff hidden in plain sight.

    I had actually given up on it a few chapters ago (the fight) because of how often the idiot ball got tossed around. The authors note on the changes they'd made to it brought me back; they clearly care about improving that facet of their writing, and the little goblin in the back of my head wanted the numbers back.

  I wouldn't be shocked at all if the frogs have a caste system in their culture that is clashing with the game's egalitarian handing out of NPs.  Maybe some dissension between rogue frogs and tank frogs.

  Alternately, in the other direction, they may have better social tech than our side is working with, maybe even such advanced concepts as 'a freaking leader'.  We'd be in trouble then.

  Chapter 21 is up. This ratfic by /u/Gilgilad7 is about the struggle for survival in a huge alien arena where humanity's finest fight against monstrous beings.
  ```

- u/Brell4Evar:
  ```
  In chapter 20, frogmen killed Alexander during the ambush. Now, we know the encounter's reward:

  * 5 NP award for first encounter (notably not requiring violence).

  * 9-12 NP award for each kill. The message says defeat, but a route  isn't a defeat for the purpose of awarding NPs (much like a rock isn't a weapon).

  Nathan, Lilly, and Iliya all made out like bandits for NPs, but any of them would agree that it was not worth Alexander's life.

  That said, two of the frogmen were actively camouflaged outside of the encounter period, and were patrolling close to the human starting area. The camouflage worked on their weapons and dropped as soon as they attacked. I'm calling this out as an elemental skill right now - one that can be unlocked.

  The NP rewards were odd: 9, 13, 12, 11, 11. Nathan has earned a total of around 125 NPs in the Arena, and Tygerion is a modern human who uses our system for math. It looks like these rewards are 10% of the NPs collected for each player. If this is the case, though, why do the rewards vary so much? The answer is that these players have already killed lone humans and scored NP rewards. The frogmen were hunting for more when ambushed.

  Hunting frogmen for NPs is a loss. Killing them in proactive self defense is easier to justify. Nathan may not have started out to do this, but that's the road they're on now.
  ```

  - u/LazarusRises:
    ```
    Why do you say that hunting them is a loss? It appears to be by far the most lucrative method of NP farming (and will become more so as time goes on). They're very dangerous, but if you can get an ambush off that's a lot of points.
    ```

    - u/Brell4Evar:
      ```
      Nathan, Lilly, and Iliya scored a total of 21.5 NPs, not counting the 5 NP bonus for first-time encounter of Species C. That's 64.5 total NPs, which does look quite lucrative. The problem here is that the ambush *was* successful, and they still lost Alexander, along with his 90 or so NPs.

      Alexander was a capable combatant, easy to get along with, and contributed as much as most other players toward the survival of his peers. His loss is a huge net detriment to his side, even aside from the net 30 or so NP loss.

      The only way PvP is viable in the Arena is to eliminate hostiles who would otherwise be hunting and killing your species. If they are - and the numbers and location of the encounter suggest this - then attacking becomes a horrifically risky necessity.
      ```
