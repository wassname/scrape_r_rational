## [D][BST] National Novel Writing Month

### Post:

November is [National Novel Writing Month](http://nanowrimo.org/). Does anyone have any plans to do it this year? October has always been my "National Novel *Planning* Month" so that I'm ready to go for when November rolls around.

Here's my advice for anyone in the planning stages:

* Figure out your characters. If you're having trouble with this, just steal from somewhere and strip off the serial numbers. No one is ever going to call you on your main character acting just like Monica from *Friends* so long as you fudge the life details.
* Figuring out characters means asking questions. You don't actually know a character until you know what motivations them, what they fear, etc. For all your principle characters, imagine them in either some stressful situation or faced with a difficult choice, then imagine the resolution.
* Figure out your plot. Dan Harmon's [story circle method](http://channel101.wikia.com/wiki/Story_Structure_101:_Super_Basic_Shit) is a more basic, more prescriptivist version of [Campbell's monomyth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monomyth). It's very easy to structure plots around it.
* Figuring out your plot means trying your best to link the story beats with "therefore" or "but", not "and". Events which are disconnected from each other are *realistic* but don't tend to make for great writing (this bit of advice is one commonly given by [Matt Stone and Trey Parker](http://www.mtvu.com/video/?vid=689002)).
* Write a single sentence description of each chapter. Then write a single sentence description of each scene within the chapter. It's easier to write a novel (and write a novel *fast*) if you're spending less time stuck looking at the page wondering what happens next (though some of that is unavoidable).

As for making all this *rational*, that's just a matter of what direction you take the story and how hard you can hammer on your worldbuilding and plot, looking for ways that you're failing, then trying to shore them up. A good way to do that is talking to other people to get a different perspective. (Making it *rationalist* is an extra level of difficulty that I wouldn't attempt if I wanted to hit 50,000 words in a month.)

**tl:dr;** So is anyone doing NaNo this year? Any plans you need help with or plots that need a second set of eyes? Any questions of rationality that need to be addressed? (I will offer my standard caution that it's better to talk about the things that you're puzzling out than the things you're really excited about, since "urge to write" and "urge to talk about the thing you're going to write" draw from the same well of enthusiasm.)

  What do people think of having a sticky thread for NaNoWriMo on every Saturday of November? That way we can get a weekly update on the progress each person is making without having every writer clutter up the subreddit for every chapter they write.

  Or is anyone pessimistic enough to think that's not something we need to worry about?

    It depends on how many people are doing it; if we only have two or three, there's not much of a point. I would be fine with using one of our two sticky slots for it though.

    I don't think "every writer cluttering up the subreddit" is a bad thing. And last time we did RaNoWriMo threads, the activity sputtered out quick. I don't think it's really worth it.

    I think that more people posting chapters is a good thing and not "clutter".  Links to rational fiction are pretty much the point of this sub.

  Personally, I'm writing the second half of *The Dark Wizard of Donkerk*, which was fully plotted out last year and just needs an additional 50K words in order to be near completion (though 50K only got me a quarter of the way through my outline, so maybe this is just going to be an epic that will take me four NaNos to complete). I've been rereading what was there before, making some small changes as I go and marking down what I see as the promises that the story is making, along with the seeds that need to sprout in later chapters. When I get some free time for it (when I finish the final chapter and appendices of *Shadows of the Limelight*) I'll go back and revise the original 40 chapter outline, which is now woefully out of date.

  I'm writing some Scooby-Doo fanfiction inspired by /u/TimeLoopedPowerGamer's [idea](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/39986f/q_can_a_dumb_protagonist_exist_in_a_rational_work/cs1m9c3).

  I also had a brief but very thought-provoking brain-storming thread [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3n8fep/d_friday_offtopic_thread/cvlu6fy).

  The story will be just making good use of Fred, Velma, Shaggy, and Scooby-Doo with Daphne as the main character and rationalist (hopefully). I don't plan on using anything other than the characters and maybe a few Scooby-Doo cliches and catch-phrases (Jinkies!). I plan on focusing on solving one mystery which is about a crime which was committed by a normal person, but the setting has a strong supernatural background (maybe something like Supernatural's weekly monsters but better working relationships between the monster species and no direct interference by Heaven or Hell) which the gang has good knowledge about. It's to show how one can still solve a regular mystery with magic as a viable alternate explanation. I would love if anyone can give examples of other stories that do the same thing.

  I plan on portraying the monsters as sociopathic towards humans (not necessarily sadistic). This means they only care about what the humans can do for them and they don't really care if the humans live or die. However they do understand that humans can be dangerous in their own way. No 'All humans are killing the Earth!' or 'All humans are weaklings!' here. So the monsters are intended to be rational actors as well.

  So far I have a good amount of world building done. I'm working on thinking about how the personalities of everyone should act like as well as whether or not any psychological disorders should be demonstrated (the gang has gone up against some terrifying creatures, yo!). I'm also planning some flashback chapters on how the gang originally first met up over an actual supernatural mystery. The only thing left I really need to decide on is just what to do for the actual mystery itself.
  ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    Are you going to be posting as you go, or keeping it private until it's done and edited? I'm interested to see where you go with the premise and what you do with the characters.
    ```

    - u/xamueljones:
      ```
      I'm not promising anything yet, but I think I'll be posting as I go, because part of the appeal of NaNoWriMo is sharing what you've written with others and the mild 'fear' of disappointing the people on this subreddit with nothing written will motivate me more.

      I plan on just posting everything to a Google Docs with a separate one for spoilers and planning out future chapters/plot points. However, I'll only post to this subreddit as I reach the milestones of 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 thousand. If I'm lucky enough to write anything after that, I'll only post it again once the story is completed.

      I really hope I can get a full 50,000 words this year.

  I'm probably not writing anything for NaNoWriMo specifically, but I might try to use the month to encourage myself to write a little bit more regularly than usual. Typically, I only find the time to write about one day a week (due to having a day job), but I'd like to try to write more often if I can find a good method of doing so.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    My plan as well. :D

    My goal is to write a rational-ish story about a time traveler's academy set inside the ten days skipped in Catholic Europe's switch from the Julian to Gregorian calendars (loosely inspired by Faction Paradox's 11-Day Empire). It's a logistical nightmare because the schooling lasts six months but they only have 8 days to work in, so there are about 24 copies of every one person inside the school at a single time. Because loose-restrictions time travel, yo.

    Anyway, it'll be about how the universe is surprisingly resilient to containing paradoxes but the administrators are trying to cover that up, and there'll be hints of a giant catastrophic War happening at some point on the metatime horizon ... no idea where to go from there, really, but I'm sure I'll think of something interesting.

    Either that, or I'll be working in my 17th-century AI-vs-Illuminati Lovecraftian thriller. I suppose I have a while to decide ...
    ```

    - u/Salaris:
      ```
      That time traveler's academy sounds like tons of fun. I hope you enjoy writing it if you decide to pick that one!
      ```

    - u/eaglejarl:
      ```
      I really hope you do the time-traveler academy one, it sound really cool.  Either way, please post as you do, since I would enjoy reading either of those.
      ```

  I tried two years ago and flunked out a few days in, but I decided yesterday that I'll try again this year. I'm trying the [snowflake](http://www.advancedfictionwriting.com/articles/snowflake-method/) method for outlining this time - last time I went in with nothing but a vague idea, and gave up when I noticed that I had no middle for my story, and no idea for one.

  If anyone wants to add me on the NaNoWriMo website, I'm [here](http://nanowrimo.org/participants/tayacan).
  ```

  - u/xamueljones:
    ```
    Wow, thanks for the snowflake method! A lot of it sounds like what I'm already doing, but it really develops the idea of doing the high-level planning of the novel first.

  I should probably try that.
  ```

- u/eaglejarl:
  ```
  I'm in.

  It will be an erom novel because they sell and they're easy to write.  I've already [entered it](http://nanowrimo.org/participants/dstorrs/novels/autumn-s-acceptance) on NaNoWriMo.org, although there's nothing there yet except the working title.

  My plan is:

  1. Finish writing the first draft of *Induction* by 9am PST November 1. 
  1. Spend November writing *Autumn's Acceptance* while editing Induction.
  1. Publish *Induction* no later than 9am PST December 1.
  1. Publish *Autumn's Acceptance* no later than 9am PST January 1.

  So, basically, two NaNoWriMos in a row.  This is a test -- I think this is doable, albeit challenging.  If I'm right then I intend to keep doing it, publishing a novel every month until I become either self-sufficient or broke, whichever comes first.  If I'm wrong then I'll keep publishing but will just have to give myself longer runways.
