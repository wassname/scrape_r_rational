  I'm enjoying this. The peril feels real, and I like that Red learned something from his first idiocy to at least work out his escape route

  Really good chapter! It was a blast to read. I can absolutely sympathize with Red's blunders in this chapter, the combination of overconfidence and boredom is devastating. I can relate to that! The final scene in the cave was ominous, really enjoyed it as well. 
  So, does the cave actually host a dead Marowak as well as a dead Kanghaskhan? Can't wait to read on!

    This is based on an old "urban legend of zelda" to list the trope.  Cubone/Marowak share a lot of similarities to Kangaskhan, so the idea was that Cubone is what happened to kangaskhan's Joey if the mother died, and it would have a divergent evolution.  This rumor was started back in gen1 before you could breed Marowak, but since the dex entry says it wears the skull of its mother, the original rumor makes more sense than the game mechanic.

  Dang, Red sucks at walking. How much is his pack supposed to weigh? I guess if he's using blankets and lanterns and bedrolls and isn't using pokeballs to store things, his lack of physical fitness would make sense given a sheltered upbringing in Pallet town. Though I'd expect both more athleticism and prudence to have been drilled into him by Oak (and through rivalry with Blue). I think I'd like Red's general incompetence more were it not for this, personally. 

  Overall though I'm enjoying this story. Maybe not quite as much as *The Game of Champions* (I do like me some competence porn), but more than I did *The Sun Soul*, which IIRC were the two other semi-realistic Pokemon fanfics that managed to hold my attention. I like the seamless inclusion of the old Cubone-Marowak-Kangaskhan fan theory -- it helps add depth to the world IMO. Here are some [more popular ones](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/top/?sort=top&t=all) if ever you hanker for ideas, or maybe look [at](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/NightmareFuel/Pokedex) other [resources](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Headscratchers/Pokemon) like [those](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fridge/Pokemon) on [TvTropes](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/ThePokedexExtendedFanonEdition). I take it that Cubone will play a larger role in this story given that it's the main image being used (or does that change regularly? I've only ever read this on mobile where no image shows up, so seeing this thread is my first time encountering it). Also, did you get the "Red finds abandoned Cubone early in journey" idea from anywhere? I swear I've seen it before. 

  I think I saw Chpt. 1 of this last year and didn't make it through. Maybe skimming it quickly I missed the transition from joke->not and found it confusing or something. It seemed a little crack-y to me, and the tone has certainly shifted in the chapters since. I'm also sympathetic to a lot of SJW-y causes and so the "I sexually identify as a Nidoran." He nodded sagely, ticking the 'M' Box" lines fell a bit flat and put me off slightly. Anyway, I'm glad I tried it again. The writing is pretty solid too!

  Also, how far plotted is this story so far? It's moving kinda slowly you're what, like, 1/50th of the way through the game/manga at 6 chapters? I like world-building/slice-of-life-y stuff, but maintaining this pace through the rest of Kanto seems untenable. You do mention that this is the penultimate chapter of this arc, so would that suggest a timeskip? 

  Are you from NZ? The predicted update times mention it. I stayed there a while back in '11 and while there went on a hiking trip on South Island (I'd explored North Island earlier). My choice of words to [announce it to FB seems relevant](https://i.imgur.com/ROEqqKQ.jpg) ;]

    That's not a joke on people identifying as something outside the gender binary. It's joke about Professor Oak not knowing what gender you are at the start of a game of pokemon.

  I loved the worldbuilding in the last chapter an this one was even better, right now this story is right up there with the origin of species for me, which is very high up.
  Can't wait to read more

  Nice! I started this story several months ago and pretty much forgot about it. Hopefully you are back for good. I can't wait to see what you have for us in the future. :)

  I'm repeating my usual early chapter mantra of "it's good that the protagonist has flaws: means there is space for character growth". At the same time, it's really starting to annoy me how stupid Red is. Reading about idiots surviving by sheer dumb luck isn't fun.
  ```

  - u/InfernoVulpix:
    ```
    He's making idiotic mistakes, but they're realistic idiotic mistakes, in line with his normal state of relatively intelligent but arising from a lack of mental discipline and perspective.  The way he makes idiotic mistakes when he's emotional (whether that's indignant anger at Giovanni's secretary or the overwhelming desire for stimulation in the Forest) makes him more human and relatable, not less.

    He's got all the groundwork, really, he just needs a few experiences like these, where things *obviously* went wrong specifically because he wasn't thinking clearly, and he'll be better prepared to restrain himself and make the choices he knows are smart, even when emotional.
    ```

  - u/Gaboncio:
    ```
    That's fair, but Red is no idiot. We've seen him learn from his mistakes, and the decision to go into the forest is obviously (to everyone but him at that moment) dumb. One important thing is to have him be dumb here when the stakes are significantly lower than when he's exploring less aggressively Reclaimed areas.
