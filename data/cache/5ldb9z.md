## How would a society deal with an easily teachable, powerful telekinesis ability?

### Post:

I recently watched an anime called Shinsekai Yori, which is about how society has adapted to deal with people having telekinetic powers that are only really useful for offense and not defense. It however has a variety of other things thrown into the mix, and its solution is unsatisfying in that it presupposes a lot of stuff that isn't intrinsic to the telekinesis itself or which is implausible, so I wonder, how would you think a society would deal with this setup:

* The ability to use telekinesis starts off being known to only one person, but is something that is easily taught and learnable by everybody.
* Telekinesis includes movement (including self levitation), molecular tearing and melding (so can raise stone walls etc), and heating/combustion on any matter (solid, liquid and gas) including directly on people.
* Telekinesis can be worked without ingredients, implements, gestures, incantations, etc, without giving any outward indication. 
* Telekinesis is worked by focused will alone. Poor concentration / surprise can result in 'rogue' telekinesis.
* Telekinesis requires you knowing your target and what you want to do, but isn't line-of-sight limited.
* The 'precision' is accurate to what can be discerned by the unaided eye (so no cellular modification etc).
* The 'power' (in terms of mass times acceleration per unit time) is several hundred times human strength.
* The 'energy' (in terms of becoming exhausted) is unlimited.
* The 'range' is unlimited.
* Telekinesis can't be blocked (you can TK past any 'force barrier' and tear a person apart, and there's no way to use TK to keep oneself from being shredded apart)
* There is no way to prevent a person from using their power (no hypnosis, no anti-magic wards, no 'death feedback' like in the anime). Also no genetic modification tech is available (unlike in the anime).

The solution of course would need to be one that allows a society to out-compete societies that adopt any other strategy. Ie. the anime has the TK users giving themselves death feedback, however the rules of evolution would have wiped them out since any TK-using society that doesn't do so (even one that decimated itself until only one member was left) can completely annihilate/enslave any group that did so.

    Agreed.  I've spend a few cycles thinking about telekinesis for world-building / story purposes:

    When you allow unlimited range and no size limits, even without all the phase changes/etc (so basically just kinematics), you are now a literal existential threat--literal planet-wrecking capabilities are at your finger tips (ram Moon into the Earth, ram Earth into Sun, etc.)

    Letting yourself be used as a battery to generate (pretty much) free energy is probably one of the more altruistic things you could do.

    t3tsubo's idea of becoming a cult leader is probably the most plausible path to victory, if you don't have ethical qualms with messing with beliefs.

    Oh wow that's a nice comic!

    Of course the first person would be circumspect with sharing its knowledge. He could take over the world with that kind of power. But eventually he'd get old, he'd want to have an heir. And would he be willing to never tell his wife and children the secret? So long as he doesn't die with the secret (and for this challenge I'm assuming the secret doesn't die), it will get out one day.

        I feel like you're just avoiding the question. I'm looking for a solution, how would society deal with /adapt to this knowledge being available.

            This is *blatantly* false. I must say.

          You phrased your prompt poorly then, just state that the knowledge of tk is widely disseminated to start instead of having only 1 person know it.

  To quote Larry Niven's ["Theory and Practice of Teleportation"](http://www.e-reading.club/chapter.php/75689/7/Niven_-_All_The_Myriad_Ways.html) with regard to an unrestricted teleportation machine: _"you don't really get a society. You get a short war."_

  So

  > Telekinesis can be worked without ingredients, implements, gestures, incantations, etc, without giving any outward indication.

  there's no way to detect who does it (making punishment very difficult)

  >There is no way to prevent a person from using their power

  and no way to prevent it?

  Don't get on anyone's bad side.

    Well I'm kind of looking for a societal solution.

      A strong tradition of total anonymity? Everyone wears burqa and uses voice changers all the time?

      If everyone in a society has a perfect weapon that cannot be blocked or traced and works over any distance, everyone in the society has veto power over everyone else's life. If these powers were given to everyone in the US right now, bare minimum all celebrities and politicians would be dead in five minutes. Most likely everyone in the world would be dead very shortly, but the people who are in the news are definitely the first to go.

  So, as a starting point, this is a super-duper-Death Note. Hell, you don't need the name *or* face of your victims as long as you can identify them. You still can't kill L, but L can't find you either.

  Like /u/KorinTower said, you *really* don't want the skill spread around.

  Can telekinesis be directly applied to a living human?
  ```

- u/t3tsubo:
  ```
  It depends on the values and how rational the personperson who figures out how TK works  is. For example, I could see your typical /r/rational min-maxxer try take over the world - probably by starting a cult/religion where s/he alone can perform "miracles". Then they could teach the TK to those who are sufficiently brainwashed into the cult in order to gain even more credibility. 

  At some point the 3 letter organizations would probably have intel/surveillance on the group from all their anti-terror networks, since even if the leader is ultra secretive/vigilant it's unreasonable to expect the entire group to escape attention. Should the CIA/FBI/KGB figure out the TK is legit and not a hack, the originator and/or the small circle of "practitioners" would probably get disappeared. 

  The first few attempts at kidnapping the TK users would probably fail due to the agencies not knowing the extent of the TKs abilities, but eventually someone would probably let their guard down. 

  What i CANT see happening is for TK to spread to the general populace unless the originator is holding the idiot ball. There is literally no incentive to teach anyone if it is as easily learn-able as the prompt says.

    So in this scenario, the original guy teaches it to those who are brainwashed into the cult. After failing a few times trying to capture the guy (since capture doesn't work), the 3-letter organizations manage to kill him. But then the next guy in the cult becomes the new cult leader. Eventually the 3-letter organizations realize that in order to root out the organization entirely they have to send in undercover agents to join the cult, and they in turn learn the secret. Also any one of the cult members or the plants could want to protect their families by teaching it to their family members (since it does offer a leg up on everyone who can't use TK, which would be just about everybody). Eventually some idiot teenager is going to post it online...
