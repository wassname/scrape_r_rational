## [RT][HSF][WIP]Set In Stone: Follower editing continues

### Post:

[A lot has changed](https://betareadersite.wordpress.com/2015/10/17/chapter-1/) - AGAIN.

I now have 9 chapters edited.  The new chapters are smaller than the old chapters, being split by scenes rather than by writing session.

A lot of fluff has been removed.  There is some additional content that was added because, quite simply, I understand Allen and how he connects to the community better now than I did when I started.

As discussed in a prior thread, the backstory will be replaced with snippets at the beginning of each chapter. (If there's anything specific you want me to touch on, let me know!)

The three flashbacks have been reorganized.  Only one is present in the first nine chapters.  The other two will occur elsewhere in act II.

The second flashback will probably occur soon, while Allen is in town, maybe after he meets Rikard (now Bernard)

The third flashback is actually quite potent as a mirror moment, even though it's a flashback.  I'll probably use it in the middle of Act II somewhere.

### Comments:

- u/imuli:

  Intriguing story! I'll note that milkweed, while not much of a food crop (though pickled milkweed buds are yummy), would likely be harvested for both latex and fluff, and not deemed a weed.

- u/Gofarman:
  ```
  I read this as it first came out, excellent characters and world building. I hope you eventually go further although I totally get your reasoning for writing "book" length stories. (We've been spoiled with fics like worm and hpmor)
  ```
