  It's been done, but it's usually pretty boring. Most SI stories rely on the main character not acting optimally, because if he did, well, things would end pretty quickly. 

  [A Wizard Named Harry](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8902388) does this well:


  >Dumbledore opened his mouth, but I continued rapidly. "Please wait a moment, sir. I've thought long and hard as to how to convince you, and the best I could come up with was eight words."
  >
  >He simply nodded, and I took a deep breath, and blurted "Tom Marvolo Riddle has eight horcruxes."
  >
  >That had to have had an effect, but I'll give the old man this much- he had a poker face that would do any card shark proud.
  >
  >"That was only six words." he pointed out.
  >
  >....
  >
  >I nodded sharply. "Well, first and most important, Voldemort... or some weird ghost-bit of him... is here, stuck to Quirrell's head under that stupid turban. He's here looking for the Sorceror's Stone... er, Philosopher's Stone?.. that you've got hidden in the third-floor hallway behind Fluffy- Hagrid's three-headed dog thing- a logic puzzle with potions, a giant game of wizard chess, and maybe some other crap....
  >
  >....
  >
  >
  >...where, I might add, you are a fictional character, and the boy whose body I've gotten stuffed into is the star of a series of popular childrens' books bearing his name."
  >
  >"And yes, I've read the series." I said, ignoring Dumbledore's look of blank surprise. "That's how I know about Fluffy and all that stuff, and fun little trivia like the fact that you're going to die of... Hell's bells, something or other, to do with the horcruxes I think... in five-ish years, that Snape is your double-agent because he still has it bad for Lily Potter and that he's going to hate Harry Potter... well, me, I guess... because I represent him never getting her, or that the teaching position for Defense Against the Dark Arts actually is cursed because of old Moldy, or... well, let's just say that it's going to be an entertaining ride."
  >
  >Dumbledore continued to stare at me for a while, then wordlessly handed me a quill and a piece of parchment.
  >
  >To this day I don't remember much about that night- just a lot of writing down of absolutely everything I remembered from the series, and then dreamless sleep.

    Harry Potter is perfectly suited for Peggy Sues/SIs because there are only a few balls in the air at any time, so the author can easily keep track of what changes have been made.

    But there's still lots of opportunity for things to go wrong. For example where was the diary kept before CoS? If you raid the Malfoys' and it is hidden elsewhere, Lucius may be sent to Azkaban and then you'll never find it.

  I feel like [With This Ring](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-story-only.272850/) sort-of qualifies. The protagonist uses meta knowledge to win a lot of the time - it rarely feels like things break their way super hard because of luck or whatever. The protagonist Paul is inserted into the Young Justice continuity, as themselves without knowledge of Young Justice continuity but *with* a power ring and very good knowledge of all sorts of associated DC Comics franchises, which knowledge they use to ensure victory an awful lot.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    The problem of With This Ring is the setting. There's waaay too much going on for Paul to be able to fix it all because of all the crossovers, so the plot progresses "episodically" fixing one minor problem at a time. I grew bored of it as it refused to widen its scope. I read about 150k words before giving up.
    ```

    - u/Geminii27:
      ```
      I felt that it went OK through the initial chapters and with Paul getting a lantern, but him staying on with the YJ team, even after taking the oath to obey Wonder Woman and Batman (and using his relations with the team to reduce/channel the sanity-breaking effects of the Ring), seems a little forced.

      It *can* be written off as him wanting to stay in Diana, Alan, and Bruce's good books until the Gaia oath is completed, and also using the opportunity to rapidly build up networks amongst the cape-and-tights set and their allies (the Atlanteans etc) which will be useful when he starts worldbuilding in seriousness. As he notes, generally it's the supervillains who have been associated with attempting rapid leaps forward in commercially-available technology. Having a lot of allies and personal contacts in the Hero biz, plus a bunch of positive PR, could go a long way towards opening doors.

      Even so, for a Rationalist story, it feels like there's too much of Paul getting dragged along in the wake of the existing superheroes - *reacting*, particularly strategically, instead of being proactive. He's got access to billions of dollars - why isn't he funding a new Silicon Valley for magitech, creating pro-magitech media, and lobbying for all he's worth to get it supported and promoted? Or researching what socioeconomic conditions produce highly educated, motivated, and well-adjusted people, and attempting to upgrade as many areas as possible to those conditions? Far too many chapters seem to consist of "Paul personally punches the superpowered enemy of the week in the face."
      ```

        He is creating a magitech revolution, but it is in Atlantis, and he is having them sell teleportation tech to the London transit grid.

        A lot of items get mentioned, put in background, then come back later.

        - u/Geminii27:
          ```
          Yes, but it's perhaps a B- or even C-plot, whereas in most rationalist fic it would be an A-plot. The story feels like it's being held back a bit by the author wanting to take a rambling stroll through the DC dictionary of obscure characters.
          ```

          - u/Frommerman:
            ```
            As someone who was never into comics, I actually quite enjoy that aspect of it. I get to learn who all these bit players are and make references to them now, without slogging through Superman is an idiot shennanigans. Sure, Paul is moving on societal uplift a little slowly, but keep in mind the time scale of this fic. He's been there for what, 8 months total? Even with a power ring, I don't think it's reasonable to assume he should have a dolmen gate space elevator and be mega - Musk already. You need public support and the kinds of resources money *can't* buy for that.

            Remember, this is very much *not* a rational setting. Schizotech gets made on the regular, then thrown aside and forgotten by the general public. Only Lex Luthor really uses this stuff to its potential, and he has the slight disadvantage of being the sworn enemy of the most broken non-lantern hero in the world. Paul can't just tell people he's going to build bleed - fracture reactors everywhere because people would probably tear them down and then forget the technology exists.

  [Dreaming of Sunshine](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7347955/1/Dreaming-of-Sunshine), maybe? Dunno. Not really getting rationalistic vibes from it, but the MC isn't *stupid* and is fairly proactive.

  Some arcs are weaker than others, and definitely has a bit of slice of life vibe (the main antagonists haven't really done much yet), but generally a good read.

  - u/FistOfFacepalm:

    I really like DoS but the author has stated that they prefer thinking/writing about administrative details and character interactions over fight scenes. Also the MC is pretty paranoid about not taking action based on future knowledge without hard evidence to point to. So probably not as much munchkinry as OP wants. 

    Also the author has an impressive dedication to adapting every single filler episode and movie, apparently. Those would be the weaker arcs you're thinking of.

        Actually they're surprisingly well done in Dreaming of Sunshine. It's very good.
        ```

        - u/Transfuturist:
          ```
          I've read Dreaming of Sunshine a bit past Tsunade's intro, and I have to say the chuunin promotions were utter bullshit. Shikako's performance as part of the Chuunin Exam was exemplary (including dealing with Orochimaru and the Sound ninja), and her forfeiture was well-calculated. In addition, in the intervening month she aided the surviving participants with their battle strategy brilliantly. And then on top of that she led most of the rookie genin to take out Gaara and his siblings with excellent tactics and no casualties. Her own performance was nothing to overlook either, certainly better than Shino's and even Shikamaru's.

          Mary Sue or not (and I'm not inclined to say she is, weirdly enough), this was an extraordinary fulfillment of duties, and it was witnessed by Kakashi, the other jonin, and all of the genin who were aided and commanded by her. She was the participant with the highest demonstration of command capability and greatest overall performance, and she wasn't even mentioned! Meanwhile, Shikamaru (who displayed less prowess in the course of the Exam, though he may be smarter), Shino (who displayed significantly less prowess, and is certainly not as command-worthy as Shikako), and *Naruto* (who has not performed significantly higher than canon Naruto, only differing by defeating Neji) are promoted to Chuunin! Naruto's performance against Neji may have been sufficient to rank him Chuunin-level in terms of power, and that may be sufficient to promote him. But when the bar is set as low as Shino's performance and prowess, it is literally impossible for Shikako to be overlooked!

          The only lip service paid to her in the chapter at all is "Sorry you didn't get through, kid. We recommended you be reconsidered ... but the Hokage put her foot down on anything less than complete agreement."

          This is total bullshit. It is utterly unbelievable on the part of a realistic leader. I don't know if this was a decision made to stave off a Mary-Sue-ish feel, but in that regard it is utterly ineffective and unbelievable in the first place. If I was inclined to think of Shikako as a Mary Sue, I would consider the passage written, being unrecognized for your achievements by a higher authority and being recognized by lesser authorities as more deserving, as *more* indicative of a Mary Sue! This is the largest strike against it, even bigger than the obsessive adherence to canon storyline (less Sasuke's defection), even bigger than obsessive adherence to the filler arcs (though I've only gone through one or two so far).

          In a consistent canon, I would consider the Chuunin Exam itself to be completely separate from the actual process of promotion. It is already only loosely tied to promotion, so it is much better to call it a Genin Tournament. Entry into the tournament is, in its official capacity, a mission that genin teams take to represent their strengths to other teams and to the civilian public. I guarantee you that's what the other participating villages regard it as even in canon, and Konoha itself should be no different. During the mission, your performance is evaluated by not only the test proctors, but your peers and confidants. After the tournament (probably periodically, or after each section, actually), each participant provides a full report and debrief of the entire events. These reports are taken into consideration as with other mission reports, and determinations may be made on a group of genin, participating or not, disqualified or not, to be promoted to chuunin, based on their performance and on their ability to fulfill the mission parameters in a manner befitting a chuunin.

          It just doesn't make sense any other way. And I feel Dreaming of Sunshine utterly dropped the ball.

            I suppose it depends on the level of your standards. In most cases I accept that I'm not going to get a rationalist quality world for characters to do their thing in, and that I'll have to make do with stuff that's still enjoyable to read. 

            Sure the ball was dropped, but I can still enjoy the rest.

            And you might like Deja Vu No Jutsu, a completed longfic which has a decent load of Shikako Nara in it.

              Thank you for the recommendation. \^\^

              > Sure the ball was dropped, but I can still enjoy the rest.

              I can get past it, but it was a severe hit to my enjoyment, and I paused my reading there. I suppose I should get through at least the next chapter so it won't be staring me in the face when I start reading again.

              > a rationalist quality world

              I suppose I should have elaborated a little on my problem with it. It is not just a problem of realism, it is a problem of storytelling. Shikako was exemplary, and I want to see her rewarded for her astounding ability. Not being recognized for it is a shot to my emotions, because it is both something she deserved and something she could have used. It is painful. And the character herself doesn't even recognize that her performance was so good!

              I almost wish I thought of her as a Mary Sue, because the level of investment I've given her so far makes my feelings so strong. If the lack of recognition actually made sense in context I would think of this as good writing, but it seems so senseless.
              ```

          - u/Jiro_T:
            ```
            From what I've read of that so far, it seems that the major problem is that Shikako has no lasting effect on anything.  She has managed to change some things in the timeline, but never in such a way that there are any longterm effects.  Haku is saved and Naruto is a chuunin and Sasuke is with Konoha... and those things may as well never have happened, since everyone goes on the same missions, Konoha faces the same threats, etc.
            ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Pretty much what Fist said, it's obsessed with keeping the plot on-rails. It's pretty much the opposite of what I'm asking. The writing was decent character-wise but I gave up when the filler arcs started and the main character started ignoring her knowledge completely.

    It definitely had Mary Sue-ness, at least partially unenjoyably. I don't have an actual definition of what constitutes Mary Sue-ness for me, or what parts of it are good or bad. It was somewhat hard to enjoy when I read it, and it may be harder for me now.
    ```

    - u/scruiser:
      ```
      The Mary Sue-ness was actually at a tolerable level for me... it was the lack of overall direction to the plot that really detractedd the story.  I mean the main character makes all these careful preparations and their is apparently some conspiracy or something manipulating things behind the scenes, but the story goes off in another direction and then it stops just when it looks like it might get back on track.

      Also, it was part of a massive collaboration self-insert project called Chess Game of the Gods  where different SI and OCs are transported into Equestria into different bodies.  Actually, by the standards of the collaboration, the Mary-Sueness of Myou've got to be kidding me wasn't even that bad, compared to some of the other characters: assassin sword smith diamond-wolf that made a sword so sharp it cuts air, a quarter-demigod Griffin that kills dragons with just a sharpened dragon scale... and those aren't even particularly over the top examples.  The collaboration also suffered, I think, from never getting to some of the interesting events the had planned out for the future.
      ```

      - u/Transfuturist:
        ```
        Ugh, yeah. Chess Game of the Gods was intolerable, and it was disappointing that Myou've was a part of that. I believe the continuity was a spin-off of Echo the Diamond Dog, or whatever?

          IIRC, I enjoyed the first CGotG story, and after finding out more stories were being written in that 'verse, almost all of which involved high-powered Mary Sue shenanigans, I felt an urge to come up with a story which followed the 'verse's rules but avoided the protagonist being turned into an UberLeet Monster With Cool Powers.

          I'll admit that things kind of escalated, especially once time travel shenanigans became merged into the CGotG timeline. And that, after a while, my urge to keep writing went away before I came to any resolution. One benefit of the latter, is that once I started writing my next piece of long-form fiction, I've been keeping in mind how I plan on bringing it to a finish - I haven't always kept the same finish in mind, but I've always had /a/ finish in mind, so no matter how low my urge to write becomes, I'll be able to tie up the story, unlike Myou've.

            ```
            I'm glad it was a learning experience for you.  I did definitely enjoy reading it, it was just annoying gradually realizing that it was a deadfic.  On my second read through of it (I liked it enough to read it a second time, I think I did the reread in-between HPMOR updates and before /r/rational had regular updates of new stuff), I noticed how the plot wasn't really reaching a conclusion or wrapping but instead adding new threads and twists.

            Also, by the way did the other CGotG authors reach a plan for a finale arc?  It seems like you and the other authors liked dropping hints and foreshadowing of some epic climatic battle against Tirek or the smooze or some other ultimate evil, but they never actually got that far.  Plus, even if they had, I don't think it would have been really able to hold my attention because some many of their SIs and OCs were so OP even some ultimate evil from the dawn of the universe would have been smacked down without too much drama beyond the usual mid-fight power-ups.

            Oh, did you have a magic system worked out?  It sounded like your OC was going to eventually figure out something besides "Latin words are magic", and it looked like you had an interesting unifying mechanic in mind.  If you aren't saving it for a future story, do you mind sharing?

            >  so no matter how low my urge to write becomes, I'll be able to tie up the story, unlike Myou've.

            Maybe I'll take another look at your post apocalypse/singularity SI fanfic.  I recall reading the first book of it, enjoying it at least moderately, but then realizing you had six books or whatever planned and I decided to hold off reading it after recalling that Myou've never got finished.

              IIRC, plans were made for an event set some years in the future, where all the remaining (surviving and non-forfeited) chess-pieces got together in some scheme by which one of the pieces would finally win the Game, get the wish, have that piece's reasonably mortal-friendly deity win the stakes, and generally bring things to a close.

              > Oh, did you have a magic system worked out? It sounded like your OC was going to eventually figure out something besides "Latin words are magic", and it looked like you had an interesting unifying mechanic in mind. If you aren't saving it for a future story, do you mind sharing?

              At some point in Missy's future, she travels back to Equestria's past, performing various actions that set into motion long-term plots culminating in the present-day of the Chess-Game. One such action was adjusting Equestria's magic field so that it would respond to Latin-style invocations. Or, put another way, the reason spell-style magic works in the CGotG universe at all was... a wizard did it. :)

  [A World Full of Monsters](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11122077/3/A-World-Full-of-Monsters) is a good Naruto SI and probably exactly what you're after, if likely dead.

  [Roger, Roger](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/roger-roger-sw-si-ii-still-not-sithy-enough.311702/) is the tale of a SI being put in to a regular b2 battle droid during the Clone Wars with foreknowledge of the animated series. Mostly focuses on military battles and the deceptions and plans the droid has to make use of to avoid being slagged by his sith masters. Gets a little sueish towards the end. Hasn't updated in a while.

  [Catalyst.exe](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/catalyst-exe.3322/) is the story of a proper AI in mass effect with game foreknowledge. Gets up to many of the ridiculous things you might expect a full power AI to get up to and is a surprisingly faithful rendition of AI in general. However, it also has the problem that the MC is a full power AI. So while that may or may not count as Sue powers as far as you're concerned, she's never going to be weak. 

  [Effloresco Secundus](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8525251/1/Effloresco-Secundus) gets an honourable mention. It's not technically an SI, rather it is Hermione Granger in Sakura's body. I'm reccing it because it has wonderful fight scenes, the main character is decently rational (if not formally rationalist) and the characterisation is extremely well done. If your tastes are anything like mine, you'll love it.

  I could have sworn there were more stories like this out there, but I guess I misremembered. Anyway, enjoy.

    Worth reading IMHO.  The author wakes up from being cryonicly frozen, after a bad singularity and is trying to prevent another one as he explores the world of a broken singularity.  Much hikinks ensue.  There are some Mary Sueish aspects, but they are mitigated by the fact that it is implied seems some super-intelligences are using the main character in their schemes.

    EDIT2: Oh god, the second volume fully embraces genre savvyness. I'd never read anything like this, even though the SI really isn't trying to fix the plot, just fix his own fuck-ups.

  I'm worried I'm gonna get hate for saying this, but what about HPMOR? Or are you referring only to characters that are explicitly self-insert but not ones heavily inspired by the author's traits?

    If HJPEV knew the plot of his first year, sure.

  Well, when I STARTED [OMGMG](http://mspaforums.com/showthread.php?58468) it was a future projected self insert.

  But honestly the character and my self has diverged so much due to things changing about how life went that it's more a loose kind of similar to me kind of character.
