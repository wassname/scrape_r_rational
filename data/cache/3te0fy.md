  Immediate comment: the conventional paragraph formatting for internet writing in general and fanfiction in particular is no indentation and double returns.

  >Twilight Sparkle, lying alongside a slow Canterlot riverbank, staring at the midday sun overhead, following larger, more wandering thoughts, shuts the book.

  *Way* too many parenthetical phrases. You do not want to separate your subject and your predicate so drastically, even as a stylistic choice. It doesn't set a good precedent for your narration in future.

  As first brought up in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3psp59/im_planning_an_rmlp_fic_how_can_i_draw_readers/), this is my stab at a rational(ist) My Little Pony fanfiction. No prior canon knowledge is (intended to be) required.

  The main goals here are to explore an MLP with

  - a more complicated non-"magic" magic system, with rules and consistency
  - characters that don't click together so nicely out of the gate
  - a quite troubled protagonist.

  I would very much value feedback of any sort! I've never written any fiction before. I'm very interested to hear from canon fans and non-fans alike. Another concern of mine is chapter length: Right now, the story is segmented into quite small chapters (1.5-3k words). This fits much more naturally with my schedule than longer, less frequent chapters, but I'm unsure whether the average reader would be okay with reading in chunks of that size. I write pretty slowly, since I'm coming at this with zero experience, and I'd really prefer to get feedback as I go, for the same reason. I do expect the segments to get naturally longer, like it seems most serial fictions do, as the story progresses and I become more purposeful as a writer. It baffles me to this day how Wildbow keeps up such an insane output. But I'm willing to conform to a spikier writing schedule if that would be widely preferred (if there's any audience at all!).

  I realize it's pretty hard to judge a story so small, so I'll probably be pretty generous with the content I have so far. So far, I've written about 15k words, which I'll post staggered for a while while I continue writing. I'll most likely post the second chapter tomorrow, and then every two days after that until I catch up. After that, Celestia only knows. =p

  As your history book mentions Wendigos, it is interesting to point out that where I am, "wendigo" is a local word that translates into Engligh as "paperclip maximizer",  although it's a bit more general as it refers to all dangerous optimizers, not necessarily transistorized or superintelligent. Although is is commonly ussed to describe insane people who act this way, the word also commonly refers to dangerous feedback systems that can occur in human interactions (as an example, Wendigo is one of the trnslations of "corporation", dut to the legal obligation to maximize profit for shareholders), or any other kind of optimizing system that poses a threat to its surrounding life forms, on any scale. This definition could make for some very interesting plot points.
