## [BST][D][Q][MK] What would you do with Intelligent Mites that still live just as long as normal?

### Post:

Hello! I've started exposing some of my world building for a future project and I was curious if anyone had some fun exploits they would apply to an element of it.

[The Mites](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/33vrtx/a_fate_market_entry_the_mites/)

Also word of warning there is also an informational time travel in this setting, that mostly resolves itself but the result of it is a kind of oppressive 'thing' called the fate market which I'll be working through in a different entry.

Right now I'm just interested what you can do with mite sized people who are 'born' with communication capability but no other knowledge and human mind like capabilities (but insufficient time to learn what most humans can).

  Cringe in horror that tens of thousands of sentient lifeforms die at such a rapid rate.

    And that's *per earring*. If a billion people on a planet, that's 10 *trillion* that die at that rapid rate. And I happen to know this setting is galactic scale, there being *lots* of planet like that.

    That is the desired response.  The setting of the fate market is cosmic horror. In the sense that the mechanics are fantastical but the innate horror of the setting is just exaggerations of the universe we actually live in.

  What *I* would do is make them as enriched as possible and then cryopreserve them. i think we can cryo and revive insects, currently, should be easy. But, if you're looking for ways to *exploit* them...

  They might be useful for nano-tech research, and/or to physically implement the things we would ordinarily want nano-tech for.

  Making things *really* clean

  Weaving spider silk

  Micro-surgeons. (If we give them protective suits they could potentially live inside a human body. With the help of tools to augment sensory and motor ability they can potentially do surgery at the level of removing individual cells level.)

  Also, there's really no need for them to be oblivious - it shouldn't be hard to give them sensory input on the macro-sized world. Just hook up a video camera to a very, very small screen (or whatever a good sensory modality is for dust mites). They can help build the tiny parts. The possibilities really open up if they can tell what's going on.
  ```

  - u/Nighzmarquls:
    ```
    Maybe not oblivious but the scope of what the larger things mean is massively outside their realm of experience.

    I suppose though given the sheer numbers they would have their "pioneers" that really appreciate the larger scale of their works while the rest are more comfortable with drudgery.

    The easy cryo is a great point.  And might be the main way to get around the "generations in a year" problem. 

    Micro surgery probably requires pretty close supervision but I can definitely see that. 

    Thanks for the thoughts.

      Oh I was assuming their services being used/rented out by other races.  I can imagine devices that have spaces built for mites into them and have little electrodes or any kind of input/output that would allow for mite-other communication.  

      For example, imagine a glove with a million piezo's woven into it.  When attatched to a decent computer, this glove could individually activate mites at the million sites and those mites could rebuild a surface that glove was touching on a microscopic scale.  Coordinated by the computer this would allow for them to do anything really.  They are just receiving a simple command, "touch the surface in front of you remove/deposit/eat x micrograms of the material" and the computer is controlling what that will be on a macroscopic scale by sending different messages to the different mites on the glove.

        Oooh, interesting!

        I imagine some of them will have to be 'on duty' in shifts of course, need to have lunch breaks and all for morale.
        ```

        - u/Ozimandius:
          ```
          Definitely, you can imagine a whole city built into a nearby article of clothing or simply make a machine.  I was fascinated by a more direct symbiotic relationship because of the play on the traditional parasitic relationship but simply making a machine that housed a huge colony of mites in style could be pretty cool.

  Is it

  or

  >[with communication capability but no other knowledge] and human mind like capabilities (but insufficient time to learn what most humans can).

  ?

  If the former, fish already die in numbers beyond my ability to grok. If it were just a normal fact of the world, I wouldn't behave differently beyond culturally accepted low-cost ways to reduce cruelty to mites. (note: predictive, not prescriptive).

  If the latter, they're an existential risk because there's no reason for their values to be in line with ours. While individuals can't learn much, there are trillions of them, each as intelligent as one of us (and the most intelligent more intelligent than the smartest human who ever lived, by the laws of statistics). 

  If we cooperate by giving them tools which they can use to build a society, like some here suggested, we may be letting the a tiny little unfriendly intelligence out of a tiny little box. And before you know it, they release a bioweapon, kill all humans and take over the world. So we should keep them from developing in an as humane way as possible^1 until we know the future is ours (e.g. after fAI has been built).

  And in the mean time we should also investigate how they manage to cram so much intelligence into such a tiny head with so small power requirements, because that doesn't fit within the known limits of biology.

  [1] I don't know what this would be, though it depends on the mites.

    The answer to your question is they are within human intelligence / mind capabilities.

    However as a species the mites don't have a lot of necessities to demand invention. Their extremely durable,  can live their entire lives in a human eyebrow. There is not a lot for them to do with their intellects and even their geniuses have to contend with having three months of activity to learn anything. 

    Mites don't generally manage to learn to read anything as complex as english. 

    Those that do are pretty incredible And it can still take A week. 


    The mechanics that make the mites possible make much more dangerous and horrific things then the mites. 

    Their on the safer side of things that use the forces involved.

      In the game of evolution, there is no such thing as sufficiency. If there is a world of plenty, the population will blindly grow to its carrying capacity, and then the tautologically unfit will start dying again. If that isn't true in the first thousand generations, it sure is true in the thousand after that. For humans, who wins and who dies is determined by strategy and politics. Forging alliances with different tribes, create ambushes, etc. For mites who have three weeks to learn it would be harder to outweigh strength, but if one in a trillion families can manage to develop meaningful strategy, it will appear and spread in years.

      Mites which manage to pass along more information to their children in those three weeks will last better, so education efficiency will be selected for. Breeding has a chance of being discovered, like humans did, and with channels of passing along knowledge this makes eugenics or perhaps the breeding of other tiny organisms possible. Eugenics with a generational turnover of weeks builds up meaningful results quickly, creating more genetic diversity in a century than humans have since leaving Africa, and there is always pressure to pass along more information more quickly with less loss.

      In my estimation, this sounds ripe for civilisation to flourish, even if individuals die in three weeks.
      ```

      - u/Nighzmarquls:

        Ah okay yes I do see the thing that is going on here, the main piece of information missing is that Genetics are not a factor on why Mites are intelligent.

        Their genes are actually the same as that of their mites.

        Another process is providing the energy and processing power for their brains.

        That said the cultural thing is definitely a good point, mites or those that work with them are going to be very very good at training mites in a short span of time.

        Although I suspect there is an upper limit on how much can be transferred to any one individual given the limit in time frame.

        If humans only lived fifteen years I'm pretty sure we would be a lot more dependent on the exceptional individuals who are able to do something economically useful by age ten.

        If the distance in time and space is too great between those individuals then we would never have them able to directly interact. 

        So in effect the Mites are suffering from a variation of the drake equation.

        Their exceptional individuals have an extremely narrow window that they can overlap with one another to progress their civilization before they have to fall back on whatever their 'average' citizen can support.

          Huh, actually because you can freeze or petrify the mites getting a bunch of geniuses together that way *would* be possible, just collect them for a while then wake them up all at once. And while the intelligence is isolated form it, selection *can* still increase lifespan and tweak hormones (and thus attitude/mood stuff), and maybe sharpen senses, and such.

  Can you use caloric restriction or thermoregulation to make them live longer? With lives that short even another couple of weeks would make a large difference.

  Mh, some other fanfic -2 year empereor by eaglejar-  used magic mites to spy on people. For your mites you need a way to store, retrieve and communicate information.
