## [Challenge Companion] Fables and Legends

### Post:

[Here's the Library of Congress's list of Aesop's Fables](http://www.read.gov/aesop/001.html).

I'm of the narrative-neurology school of thought; if there's something that stories are doing, it's because they're hooking into our brains, exploiting quirks of the human mind in ways that are intuitive and evolved instead of truly calculating.

So that brings up the question of what, specifically, fables tend to be doing. Part of it is probably just people following the patterns of their ancestors, but I think there's likely something deeper underlying it, since it's a pattern that has survived for a such a long time.

Anyway, this is the companion thread for the weekly challenge. Found a story that seems like it fits? Have some insight into the challenge topic? Post it here.
