  In which we learn that group think can stop robo reason, but only for a while and that vague future messages from human actors are subject to human actor weaknesses. 

  I am glad author revised that part in this chapter, though I understand he wasn't aiming for RT story but story with RT elements that for me anyway passes the threshold for RT and RST. Yay author!
