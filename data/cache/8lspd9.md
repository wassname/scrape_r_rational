  Impressive story.  I had thought the idea of cooperating with Voldemort and Voldemort agreeing to cooperate would stretch my suspension of disbelief too much, but you actually sold me on it perfectly, keeping both Tom Riddles in character and building up to their deal well with just minor shifts from the original story.

      Also, I think you should somehow work in the quote from taboo tradeoffs about how utilitarians were allowed to take common sense into account and how real life utilitarians dont actually rob banks to give to the poor. Then say something about how people aren't smarter than their ethics.

      Situations where its best to violate your deontological ethical injunctions in order to accomplish greater good are rare, while also being easy to find and hard to check. The exact opposite of P=nP? problems.

      One should be extremely skeptical and make absolutely sure that there is no other way before violating one's deontological ethical injunctions. And its almost always more likely that you've made a mistake then that it was really the optimal choice to break your ethics. It would have been a bit more believable if Harry hadn't been so easy to convince to do this.

    Coming from Voldemort, sure. But perhaps the real Tom Riddle is completely, utterly, irredeemably evil in an interestingly different fashion from what he was pretending with Voldemort.

      Also, you wrote balefire instead of fyndfire once or twice. Though I'm enough of a WOT fan to kinda prefer this anyway.

      Edit: also, pretty great story. Enjoyed it a lot.

        It is that way in the original. Blame Yudkovsky.

  Are you going to rewrite the end too? Because I just read to them stepping out to set their plans in motion and Im craving more.

- u/WalterTFD:
  ```
  My 'solution' when the original dilemma was posted was in the same direction.  That is, the Unbreakable Vow fixes the trust problem, and should allow Harry's believable surrender to Voldemort.

  I was less hopeful re: their cooperation, I tended to believe that this was a "maybe the horse will learn to sing", where Harry just set himself to service and hoped that Voldemort's reign wouldn't be so bad, or that someone else would do something.
  ```

- u/Ristridin1:
  ```
  I liked it.

  One point that I think should be expanded on is Voldemort accepting the premise that a prophecy has to be fulfilled. He's trying to kill people to stop the prophecy he heard, so at some level, he believes that prophecy can be averted (which is true, as Dumbledore mentions blocking other prophecies of destruction). So why does Voldemort so easily accept that this particular prophecy cannot be stopped? The answer 'it has already been partially fulfilled' seems a bit weak without any evidence that a prophecy has to be completely fulfilled or not at all.
  ```

  - u/melmonella:
    ```
    Yeah, that came up when I was planning the story. Ultimately I decided that it would be best to leave that without justification, for two primary reasons.

    * As far as I could find, there is no solid evidence for *or* against that in the original, other than the way the ending turned out. 
    This means that I'd have to come up with evidence on the spot, which is a pretty bad writing move, and I think would have felt forced. This interpretation wasn't contradicted by anything, so I decided to let it pass.


    * Intuitively, that seems like a more likely consequence of a  mechanism that might be behind the prophecy. 

    Like, say I told you "my world has prophecies" and asked you to come up with a set of models for this world, with their simplicity rated according to Solomonof Induction. The most probable model would probably be "prophecies can't be averted" - you receive a bit string from the future, and then no matter what you do (with the string or otherwise) laws of physics ensure it ends up in the same state as it started when I went back in time. And then whatever mechanism that sends information back in time just sends that string back. This model gets a Bayesian update to pretty much zero probability from Dumbledore saying he averted some prophecies, and from QQ thinking that it's possible to avert prophecies.

    The *second* most probable model, in my opinion, would be "Either the string gets sent back in time, or the negation of the string gets sent back in time" i.e. suppose that in the future the string would be 100110. Now either the past receives 011001(in which case prophecy was averted entirely in this timeline), or 100110 (in which case prophecy was fulfilled in this timeline). This is the second most simple algorithm for prophecies, and the one I went with. It also pretty much means that after you've observed and confirmed the first bit, you know how the other ones will end up.

    Finally, you have even more complicated algorithms for prophecy information, such as "any part of the string can be fulfilled or averted, with some complicated relation between them that ensures prophecy still tells you *something* instead of being effectively white noise". I don't think those are *so* improbable as to not be worth considering, but they are still less probable on priors.


    [Weaker arguments start here]

    * Counterfactually, if it *was* possible to fulfill a prophecy just in part, QQ would have known about it and said as much. Since he didn't say anything, it's clearly not possible.

    * As I've pointed out above, justifications of this would have felt forced and would have simply drawn more attention to this weak point. Since most people didn't seem to notice it, I feel that my sight deception had been successful.

    But yeah, this is probably one of the weakest points of the fic, in my own authorial opinion. Very good catch.

  See now I really want to read a sort of alt-universe version of significant digits based on this rewrite of the story.

  Presumably the Quirrellisation plan will need to be Snapproved as a valid prophecy resolution before they can proceed...

      There seem to be a lot of cases where the grammar resembles Parseltongue even after they're no longer speaking Parseltongue.
