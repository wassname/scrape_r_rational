## [Q] Any books like "The Martian"?

### Post:

I loved "The Martian" by Andy Weir. Are there are any other modern hard SF rationalist books that I might like? I've read all of Greg Egan's stories, and I'm currently burning my way through "The Hard SF Renaissance".

Bonus if the book involves MacGyvering on an epic level like in "The Martian".

Thanks!

I will add to this list as the suggestions roll in.

1. The Mars Trilogy by Kim Stanley Robinson.
2. Tau Zero by Poul Anderson.
3. The Boat of a Million Years by Poul Anderson.
4. Lost Moon by Jim Lovell and Jeffrey Kluger (nonfiction).

7. Anathem by Neal Stephenson.
8. Snow Crash by Neal Stephenson.

  Let me strongly second the recommendations for Peter Watts.

  Both Blindsight (since released as creative commons [here](http://www.rifters.com/real/Blindsight.htm)) and Echopraxia are IMHO up there with the best SciFi books in recent years. Watts does his research thoroughly (after all, he holds a PhD in Marine Biology) and usually his major plot points are firmly rooted in science-fact. He even goes so far as to include detailed bibliographies in the appendices of his books where he also explains his reasoning behind less obvious conjectures. As a writer, he is a rare beast. He does not appear to _want_ to pander to the masses, instead preferring his readers to do their own thinking. 

  Especially Echopraxia left my small mind blown and terrified on a _philosophical_ level. It is cutting edge SciFi, as hard as it gets without shying away from extrapolating beyond the strictly "known" facts about reality. Highly recommended and high up on the "rationalist" shelf IMHO.

    I am a fan of Watts and the Firefall series in particular, so I could second (third?) the recommendation with a caveat that Watts' work is absolutely nothing like The Martian and it's easily possible to like one and hate another. 

    Martian is a quick read, pretty lighthearted with plenty of humor, language is plain, colloquial. Watts' books are gloomy, dense, feature some occasional bleak humor but not much, might require several readings, language is... imagine a university science text book written by Oscar Wilde. Oh, and if you thought GRRM liked killing characters, wait until you read Watts. None of it is necessarily a minus, but worth keeping in mind though.

      > [...] Watts' work is absolutely nothing like The Martian and it's easily possible to like one and hate another.

      Yes sure. I hoped to make this clear already in my post. Watts is way less light-hearted and reading him requires intellectual engagement. This is _not_ a bad thing. But since OP said, he enjoyed Greg Egan, I can at least say that Watts has already been compared to the former on numerous occasions in book reviews.

      EDIT: I just stumbled upon one blurb which puts it pretty succinctly:

      > “[Watts’] famously dismal brilliance … stuns you with its barrage of smart ideas and cutting-edge research, then disarms you with its grim determinism and unsympathetic, semi-posthuman characters, and ends up, pretty much, by just making you want to crawl under a rock. This is not a novel that wants to invite anyone in for tea.”

      That's a fair warning. Normally this would put me off. I tried and failed to read through 1984 by Orwell on multiple occasions. Because I knew how it was going to end. I have re-read Echopraxia once already and the thought of doing it again at some point excites me. FWIW. YMMV.
      ```

  - u/vergere6:

    Yes indeed. Note that I added the Peter Watts books on my own before anyone recommended them. I read them quite a while back, possibly thanks to r/rational. Echopraxia is indeed terrifying. Blindsight almost convinced me that sapience isn't worth the extra energy use.

    I've bought "Being No One" by Metzinger, as Watts recommends. Trying to read it. It's quite dense.

  All right having [said](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/36fjfy/q_any_books_like_the_martian/crdx3ld) what I did about Watts, let's add some more:

  * I enjoyed "Halting State" and "Rule 34" by Charles Stross. Believable near-future SciFi and explicitly exploring social media, augmented reality, 3D printing, distributed consensus algorithms, dark nets and similar concepts in a geopolitically informed way. What I like about Stross is that the near-future world he paints is full of concepts which you never thought of but seem stunningly plausible "in hindsight". Stuff like "you hail a bus by bidding a certain amount of money on your mobile app to get to your destination. How fast you'll get to your destination is then based on how much the other passengers bid and from the route the algorithm derives from that." Tickles my nerd bone to no end. Aside from that, his earlier work "Accelerando", while already slightly dated is still an excellent read. Over a thousand pages, starts in the near-future and moves through the technological singularity and out the other side. Many consider this to be Stross' seminal work.

  * Anathem by Neal Stephenson. One of my favorite SciFi books ever, period. It's not for everyone, it's quite deep on philosophical concepts and it's in the dialogues between the protagonists where most of the "action" happens, at least in the first half of the book. Highly intellectual, salted with some classic coming-of-age concepts and set in a world where the scientific method and rules for rational thought have had centuries to mature. Science is practiced mostly in secluded "monasteries " by people living in ascetic monk/nun-like lifestyles, segregated from a cyberpunk-esque outside world. Speaking of cyberpunk, if you haven't read "Snow Crash" by Stephenson yet, do so _now_. It is a really short book and absolutely essential literature background as any self-respecting nerd. The plot is insane, amazing action scenes interspersed with some really interesting intellectual concepts, plot twists and totally crazy yet somehow plausible world building. Oh and the book singlehandedly inspired the later creators of "Google Earth" and those of "Second Life" and it anticipated both those things back in 1992 where most other SciFi authors hadn't even heard of the Internet yet or thought it just a fad.
  * [After Life](http://sifter.org/~simon/AfterLife/) by "Simon Funk" (an alias). Highly intelligent, self-published (but freely available online) writing by an A.I. researcher. Starts with mind-uploading and moves from there. Got a lot of praise in a lot of futurist blogs when it first made the rounds a few years back. I actually bought a hard-copy somewhere and I am glad I did. 
  * You might _really_ enjoy [The Finale of the Ultimate Mega Meta Crossover](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5389450/1/The-Finale-of-the-Ultimate-Meta-Mega-Crossover) by Eliezer Yudkowsky. I quote from the link: "This work contains humongous spoilers for *A Fire Upon The Deep* by Vernor Vinge and *Permutation City* by Greg Egan. If you're ever planning to read those books, then you should stop *now* and read them *first*. Especially *Permutation City.*[...] **MEMETIC HAZARD WARNINGS**: Concepts contained in this story may cause SAN Checking in any mind not inherently stable at the third level of stress. Story may cause extreme existential confusion. Story is insane. The author recommends that anyone reading this story sign up with Alcor or the Cryonics Institute to have their brain preserved after death for later revival under controlled conditions. Readers not already familiar with this author should be warned that he is not bluffing." Classic Eliezer. If you haven't read Vernor Vinge yet, I second the notion that you should read the following first:
  * "A fire upon the deep" and "A deepness in the sky" by Vernor Vinge. Insane world-building, especially where Exobiology (and by extension Alien life forms) are concerned. Mostly concerned with big sociopolitical topics and less with technical shenanigans. Still very much worth a read.

    Snow Crash is *amazing* - I'm reading and loving it right now - but I really wouldn't call it similar to The Martian (which I also loved). I'd describe it as "Neuromancer, but way, way more entertaining."
    ```

  I really hope you get an answer on this. 

  Hm. Actually...who would be willing to pay to read another Weir book like "The Martian"? If I reached out to Andy and said "you should run a Kickstarter to fund another book, and I've already got $1,000 lined up" the chances of us getting another one are pretty good. 

  I'd throw $50 at it. Anyone else?
  ```

  - u/vergere6:
    ```
    I would throw $50 at it as well. I'd want some space or exoplanet SF, personally. The same Mars story wouldn't have been captivating in quite the same way (to me) if it was set in the Atacama Desert or something.
    ```

- u/boomfarmer:
  ```
  There's the Mars Trilogy by Kim Stanley Robinson (*Red, Green,* and *Blue Mars*), the appendix anthology of short stories *The Martians*, and the not-sequel-but-set-in-a-similar-universe-and-much-later *2312*.

  You may also be interested in *Tau Zero* and *The Boat of a Million Years* by Poul Anderson, but those are hardly modern.
  ```

  - u/vergere6:
    ```
    I've read the Poul Anderson ones, and the Mars Trilogy has been on my to-read list for quite a while. I can't remember if I read them when I was younger or not.

    Thanks for your suggestions!

    Good one! This probably comes closest to OP's desire to get some insane hackery, along with his other work:

    * [Demon](http://www.shigabooks.com/index.php?page=001) arguably isn't fully _hard_ SciFi but all the important MacGuyvering is. Without spoilering: There is a single "magical" thing going on and the protagonist then finds ways to deal with that in a rational (heck, at times even _rationalistic_) manner. Highly recommended.

    (Eneasz, I also really enjoyed your very own *Red Legacy*! Very nice idiological angles and twists. I'd put this one more in the "classic SciFi" camp but it is short and fun, so I'll plug it anyway. (Note for all others: You can listen to the dramatized story in form of two freely downloadable audio episodes [here](http://www.hpmorpodcast.com/?p=1429) and [here](http://www.hpmorpodcast.com/?p=1442).  The raw text isn't available, since it's actually [published](http://www.deathisbadblog.com/i-am-published/) but /u/embrodsky wisely kept the audio rights for his work))
    ```

  ```
  Again, not exactly hard SF, but any Iain Banks is pretty good. And Garth Nix's Abhorsen trilogy is fantasy pure and simple, but the magic follows rules and the rules shape people.

  "Rendezvous with Rama" is about a massive, possibly abandoned alien ship entering the solar system, and the astronauts who explored it. Hard Sci-Fi, bordering on "Very Hard". I didn't actually love it all that much, mostly because it's written in the 1970s and I'm usually a a "90s and up" guy, but it's hard sci-fi in our solar system. The astronauts use the gear they have on hand, but it's not really "MacGyvering".
  ```

  - u/vergere6:
    ```
    The Rama trilogy definitely belongs on this list. Thanks for reminding me. I agree that it's not really MacGyvering, but it's still a great example of the kind of attention to detail (with regards to technology) that I enjoyed in "The Martian".
    ```

    - u/ancientcampus:
      ```
      I had a brief scare that I'd mistyped it as "Rendevous with Ranma". If there isn't already a smut fic named that, then I'm a monkey's uncle.
