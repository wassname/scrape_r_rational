  So each **Wish** has a permanent cost, implied to be years off of his life. That corroborates with Villainous Interlude: Calamity III, where he said: 

  >“Well isn’t this is a mess, if you’ll forgive my language,” the Tyrant grinned. “Your ornery friend with the spells cost me a Wish, but it was worth it to see all this with my own eyes.”

  Huh. In the hands of the Tyrant, who wouldn't balk at throwing away years of time for his schemes, that is almost absurdly powerful. It also kind of explains how he has so many gargoyles. He doesn't care about money, since he'll be dying soon anyways. He might be hard-capped at thirteen, since it was said that he wouldn't reach his thirteenth nameday, even though he's well older than that by now
  ```

    ```
    Don't forget that he's been ruling for six years by now. With three on-screen uses of the Aspect, that's at most four uses remaining.
    ```

    - u/Nic_Cage_DM:
      ```
      Why would he have to use a wish every year? Surely he'd just have to spend one wish on not aging.
      ```

      - u/Zayits:
        ```
        I don't think that's quite how this works. The thing in the tomb said that Kairos would die before his thirteen nameday, and though we don't know the exact wording, I suspect that it could be interpreted as "You'll live for thirteen years under your Name" and he simply didn't catch that because the idea of becoming a Tyrant didn't cross his mind until the confrontation with his father. Skein implied that each Wish cost him one year from a very limited lifespan - one he already had lived six of.

        As for not aging, that's not exactly how this works. Villains don't age by default, but Kairos' death is predestined. I'm not sure a Wish can counter something that didn't happen yet and doesn't have much reason to hapen other than the story that keeps the Aspect going in the first place - and so far there's room for this story to be about a madman who tried to defy fate only to end up fulfilling the same prophecy he's been trying to break.

  You know, for all of the chuckles Tyrant gets out of me, I underestimated how badass he could be

  From the comments:

  >I mean, why would anyone doubt the Tyrant’s eternal friendship? It’s obvious from the very start that Kairos would help the Black Queen forever and ever. Clearly this turn of events is very much predictable and EE should rewrite this chapter.
