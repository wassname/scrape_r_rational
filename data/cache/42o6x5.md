  I'm up to 25% in this novel, and so far it seems to belong in the very, very tiny subset of AI stories that are not bloody stupid, a heroic and almost unbelievable accomplishment.

    ```
    Is the AI winning by 25% of the way through, or is there some valid reason it's not?

      It's a slow takeoff scenario. Growth seems the most likely out of all of them to end up superintelligence, but right now they're working with smart levels that are... pretty much par with what most humans can do, really. They don't even have any real advantages in learning math quickly or whatever, and their primary advantage is their ability to make decisions by committee.

      Which is refreshing. For much the same reasons as that one post in this sub about how rationalfics about rational!protags stomping the setting was getting a little tiring, this is a refreshingly well-written, realistic take on an AI that doesn't go hard-takeoff within the first few chapters.

        It's interesting to see AIs with utility functions that don't automatically make them perfect long-term planners, since they're modeled roughly off human minds.

    Wait...those exist!?

      CelestAI and Jane from *Queen of Angels* (but not the sequel) both come to mind.

    Many of the golden age AI stories were fantastic and thought provoking. I'm not sure when we decided to become stupid with regards to AI.

  I have spent the past four hours reading this and haven't even noticed where the time went.

  This is *fantastic* work, and I really love the dynamics of each conversation.
  ```

- u/Drazelic:

  I really love this story. It takes the usual dichotomy of poorly-designed-paperclipper-god-intelligence vs. friendly-ai-here-to-end-suffering-forever, and really SKEWS it into something orthogonal and unique. 

  [Spoilers for about 50% of the way through the story](#s "I feel so bad about Heart. The researchers just don't get a break, do they? First they make Sacrifice who literally annoys her fellow mindstrands into lynching her, and now they've made Heart who's so powerful that the other mindstrands are going to have to kill her too just to carry out their own utility functions. It's such a tragedy when viewed from the inside and it's so plausibly something that I could see somebody like EY whose primary concern is if the AI doesn't have a friendly utility function actually implementing. I hope Heart doesn't get killed off later on.")

    The very beginning hints at the ultimate fate of both, I'd imagine.
    ```

- u/FeepingCreature:
  ```
  Maybe I'm biased because I can see the project going wrong from the inside, but are the researchers _really stupid_ or is it just me? I mean, this isn't how you do responsible development, it's taking a project that you _know_ is broken and instead of stepping back and asking themselves "how did we write a broken AGI", they try to monkeypatch it again and again!

  Raagh.

  - u/Raelifin:
    ```
    Author here. Make sure you're mentally distinguishing intelligence and wisdom/rationality. Yes, these researchers are not being as cautious as they ought to be, but they also are operating under the common misunderstanding that "if we see something go wrong, we can pull the plug and fix it". And, to be fair, this strategy actually works a couple times. I do not think that the scientists at the university are unrealistically foolish compared with real, modern AI researchers.

      I don't think it's an unreasonable level of incompetence, but it still pains me.

        Yep. I've read that too. In the books, both Gallo and Myrodyn are concerned about takeoff. Others on the team are satisfied that the project has "an ethics supervisor" and leave it at that. Naresh is blind from years of working close enough with the problem that he can't take the outside view. Myrodyn is too arrogant. Etc.

        The point is that while we'd love to live in the world where ultra-precise safety measures are set up and enforced with constant-vigilance, we actually live in a world where safety theater is a thing and people routinely make big mistakes. Yes, it's painful to see it failing from the inside, but it doesn't strike me as clearly unrealistic. :)
        ```

        - u/None:
          ```
          Agreed. The only bit that does seem unrealistic to me is the fact they are willing to use the crystal of unknown, (but presumably alien) origins so casually. Any realistically paranoid government would have assumed it was a trap, so destroyed it or only examined it from the outside very carefully. 

          However you do seem to be keepin the origins and nature of it deliberately vague, so I trust you have something clever planned

  Wow this is really good. I'm 36% of the way through and it's so awesome. Ahhhh.

  I didn't expect any AI fiction that would be good, but it is. This is easily in my top 10 books.

  I'm on the edge of my seat on what's gonna happen. I love them all, except [Spoiler](#s "Heart, who I've not seen much of yet. She's such a bitch.") Can't wait to continue reading.

  Keep up the good work; I'll be looking at future creative work that you'll be doing. You have a new fan :)

    to be fair to the spoilered one, any of them would've have acted exactly the same way if they'd been dealt the same hand at the start.
    ```

    - u/Green0Photon:
      ```
      True, true. Yeah, the guy who did that's a bitch. And yet, perfectly reasonable to do, if you don't think about how the ai system works, hard and well. Perhaps [Spoiler](#s "Garo? Was that how you spell it?") or other peeps could have prevented it.

      Damn this book is good. This sort of thing is how we know we have a good writer and a good book.

  This is amazing. It's past midnight, and I just finished the whole book in one sitting, and all I can say is go read it.

  This was an excellent read. I was captivated from the beginning. I enjoyed all the characters both in the Crystal and outside it. If this book were licensed or sold in such a way that I could buy a copy, I would do so. As it is, I'll just share it with my friends. I look forward to the sequels. Thanks for writing such an entertaining and thought-provoking novel.

  This is a very good story, but I feel I should mention that it is currently somewhat hard to google. Trying "Crystal Society story" gave me this submission as the first relevant result, and that was the only one I found.

  This can safely qualify as a Rationalist RST fiction, protag is perfect for analyzing human thinking patterns and social customs. I especially like the several trope deconstructions in regards to humor. The human characters are a bit trusting and easygoing, then again this universe has no Moody to yell CONSTANT VIGILANCE! so that can be forgiven.

  Division of AI into several characters is a great way to keep the story in thinking mode, without boring the reader, especially since some of them embody the alien/hilarious AI types, absurd humor rising from their interaction and necessity to fulfill purpose are fantastic, the parts about banners/statues and child to knowledge ratio for example.

  The fact that the author has written and entire book and posted it in one go is extremely commendable, this prevents the serial format problems of having to wait, story cliffhangers and reading like an addict. Also more books are coming so YAY!

  Good job mister Max Harms (is this a pseudonym or does your name really mean maximum harming?)

  Completed it today. Decent, though it loses steam about halfway through. I think the AI should have prioritized increasing its intelligence and agency above what it did enough that it would have been a player (or had accrued the strength to be) on the world stage before a certain meeting could take place at the end of the story.

  Excellent read, this is the kind of thing I wish there were infinitely more of. I was hooked from start to finish; probably my single favorite depiction of an AI. That said, not perfect-- most of my criticism is fairly subjective, but see below:

  **Loved**

  * Excellent depiction of AI thought process; I was constantly entertained by a multitude of disparate goals coalescing into something resembling normal human behavior. Enjoyed the debates, the different entities, the way they fought for control of Body. The whole *Inside Out* AI thing was a stroke of creative genius. 

  * The story introduced me to the sub and rational fiction as a whole :)

  **Liked**

  * Overall writing style, memorable and distinctive characters. Usually when I blaze through a book I can barely keep track of the characters; here, each one stands out vividly and I cared about what happened to them. You're a good writer, particularly considering this is the first full-length work you've actually finished. 

  * I'm writing a novel that tackles similar issues (automation, basic income, AI, etc) and also have a Red Eagles-esque terrorist group; exact same ideology to a tee. Bit of a bummer to realize I'm not as creative as I imagined, but ultimately I was happy to see that the concept works well in execution. 

  * Diversity; not just in the tumblr/PC buzzword sense, but in a general realism sense. In film, every world-shaking event seems to involve white people, usually on the US eastern seaboard. In real life, the world is shaped by people from all over the world, and important events can transpire anywhere. 

  **Disliked**

  * The way they got access to the Internet was ingenious, but I felt there was still something of a missed opportunity; there should have been a second AI whose only purpose is to monitor and contain Socrates. It could serve as a final obstacle before breaking free of their birthplace and into the world at large. 

  * I would have enjoyed the story much more if the aliens were eliminated entirely and Crystal Socrates spends the story trying to bootstrap herself to greater intelligence, eliminate human impediments, or even challenge a rival AI. The aliens seemed to unnecessarily clutter the story, and the odds of AGI and extraterrestrial life emerging simultaneously are miniscule. That said, I did appreciate that the aliens were *genuinely* alien rather than men with green skin. 

  * The Zephyr romance and in particular, the sex scene seemed unnecessary to the plot. 

  * No happy ending for Avram, Mirodyn was relegated to a backstage role (participating in the plot but largely unseen), and Maid Mariam was introduced, then quickly shuffled offstage. Aww... I expect to see all three back in future installments!

  I read that after Crystal Socrates, you probably won't write another book. I do hope you reconsider; the genre needs more like you.

  Done:  (text to speech rocks). What is the ETA on the next book finishing editing?  I'm not sure if you've exceeded the Godzilla threshold or not with your ending. There's a c. and a g. word I think I have translations for but look forward to seeing if my evolutionary extrapolation fills.
  ```

  - u/Raelifin:

    ETA on Crystal Mentality (book #2) is December or early January.

  Wow. Awesome story! Stayed home from work today just to read it straight though.  A good AI story with interesting aliens! Fantastic.  
  Is it a complete accident that it came out just as Marvin Minsky passed away? Could almost be seen as referencing his thoughts.  
  Either way. Great work. Looking forward to the next one!
  ```

  - u/Raelifin:
    ```
    Yes, it's just coincidence. I like to think Minsky would have enjoyed the book. He'll be missed.

    I'm glad you liked it. The next one should be out in a bit less than a year. :)
    ```

- u/Dr_Gleb_Tsipursky:
  ```
  Of all the fiction books I read - and believe me, there were many - this is the most insightful one in addressing how people think and feel, and modeling how a true Artificial Intelligence might think and feel. Written by a long-time student of AI and human mental processes, this book draws on fields as disparate as psychology, cognitive neuroscience, behavioral economics, math, quantum mechanics, and many others to bring to life a truly authentic possible world.

  From that description, you might think it's boring. Well, I staid up late into the night several days reading this book. Coming from someone who values his sleep a lot, this is saying something! It's a real page-turner, and captures your attention right from the start. Each chapter leaves you hungry for more, and the book delivers. As a best-selling author myself, I can attest that the book was crafted carefully, over time and with much love, to optimize the experience of the audience. I'm really looking forward to all the subsequent books in this series!
