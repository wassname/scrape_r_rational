  I'll probably drop to posting this in this sub maybe once a month soon, but right now I'm still in the early desperately-fishing-for-feedback phase, so it's probably okay to be a little shameless.

  I'm still finding my feet and not on a proper schedule yet, and looking for ways to maybe tweak the story to improve reader retention. I'm particularly thinking of maybe cutting the first half of the prologue and dispersing the information elsewhere, but I'm not sure it's a good idea or if there are actually even any problems with it. I'm also not sure if the general slow story pace is good for the format, or how I could improve on that if it is. Vagueness vs over-explanation is another thing I've been considering.

  If anyone is following, let me know your thoughts! Writing traditional mystery is tough.

  Plenty to chew on here. I'll hold off on speculation but I think I'm putting a few things together.

  Sidney and Sasha work together pretty well, both in the literal sense and that I enjoy reading about their interaction. 

  Sasha is 2/2 for disappointing food or drink. Get her something tasty, she's working hard!

  For what to cut from the prologue, I don't know if the description of Edward is needed in that much detail right off the bat. It might work better as something we get in-between one of the main arcs. I was interested as I originally read the passage, but I think I would have cared more about it if I'd already spent some time with Sasha. Also, I think the bit at the end of Mimic's Prayer (1) works better if you are wondering why Sasha is feeling that way instead of having a decent idea based on Edward's description.

  Thank you for the Glossary. It's hard to keep track of what I don't know about the setting because they haven't been revealed yet and what I just missed, so the extra context is very helpful.

  Few typos:

  >alongside a statue of a man holding up **a spears**

  >contact with her **my** virtue of my position

  >April 22nd, 873.

  (That's from Mimic's Prayer (1). Glossary says Summer Revolution ended in 878, and Michelle was murdered five years after the armistice. I think that's supposed to be 883).

  And I'm not sure if this last one is a mistake or not but

  >where the young swore the First Oath and became full citizens.

  Are they not swearing the full Five Oaths to become full citizens?
