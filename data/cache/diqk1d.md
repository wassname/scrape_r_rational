## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding and Writing Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*
* Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is *also* the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  I have a story that's mostly written, but when I wrote it, I wanted to accompany it with illustrations. Now I'm at the point where I have maybe one illustration (out of ~50) and would really like to publish the story, but am not sure if the story would hold up without the illustrations. And I know that the illustrations I'd want for the story are beyond my current illustrative skill, whether that be in pencil-on-paper or in The Gimp.

  So I have a bunch of questions:
  - what software do you use for illustration?
  - is it better to do 50 thumbnails, or 1 complete work, when testing whether illustrations are necessary for the story
  - are pixel-perfect mockups necessary for phone UI, or can the interface details be gestured at and readers be reasonably expected to interpret them as necessary?
  - what can be done to make sure a story written for illustration works well without illustration?

    >what software do you use for illustration?

    I use Inkscape for vector art, Gimp for photo manipulation, Gimp for pixel art (though I'd like a better tool there), and Paint Tool Sai for painting. Vector art, photo manipulation, and pixel art can be done with a mouse (hell, I use a trackpad), but I'd never do free hand illustration/painting without a pen. I use a Wacom Intuos 4 for that. If you don't have/want a graphics tablet, another option is pencil and paper and a scanner. The process there is sketch, scan, ink, color, and I can go over some of the details if you like.

    >is it better to do 50 thumbnails, or 1 complete work, when testing whether illustrations are necessary for the story?

    You need at least one complete page. You can fill in with (full-sized) sketches for the rest; sometimes even Placekitten.com is an adequate substitute.

    > are pixel-perfect mockups necessary for phone UI, or can the interface details be gestured at and readers be reasonably expected to interpret them as necessary? 

    Is this part of your story? Is the thing you're illustrating a phone UI? If so you use Inkscape. I doubt being pixel-perfect matters. Being complete would help a lot, but you only need to be complete in the foreground.

  I'm planning on writing a rational JoJo fanfic. I've got more than ~~14~~ 19 pages of ideas I want to explore, but I could always use more.

  What do you want to see in a more rational JoJo?
