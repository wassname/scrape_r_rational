## April Genre Fiction Challenge

### Post:

...Are all the April Fools Day jokes gone?

Great, now we can get down to serious business...the business of seriously profiting off humor, that is! ;)

This month, your task is to write a COMEDY.

Brief description: Make people laugh, don’t make people cry except when it's accompanied by uncontrollable wheezing laughter.

Comedy is highly subjective, but there are several common genres that are popular.

>*Satire — pokes fun at contemporary political, social, or other topical issues.*  
>  
>*Farce — often used in theatre, presents a highly improbable plot that centers around eccentric and exaggerated events.*  
>  
>*Screwball — much like farce, it presents exaggerated situations, but is often used in romantic comedies.*  
>  
>*Parody — imitates the style of other genres to poke fun at them.*  
>  
>*Irony — presents a comedic gap between reality and expectations.*  
>  
>*Dark — pokes fun at a topic that is typically considered taboo.*

(Mostly just examples of comedy and jokes, but there’s a quiz at the end so you can test your comedic knowledge)

Some prompts: [https://blog.reedsy.com/creative-writing-prompts/comedy/](https://blog.reedsy.com/creative-writing-prompts/comedy/)

(There’s 4 pages btw, my favorite is page 2. The prompt about the ‘first snowstorm ever’ made me cackle, since 2014’s snow storm meme is literally my state.)

Guidelines:

• There is no set word limit. Write and post as many words as you like! (technically there's a 500 word minimum, but I'm not counting)

• You’re encouraged to include rational elements in the fiction, but the main challenge is to write an enjoyable genre fiction. Everything else is gravy.

• Post your work as a comment to this thread, which can include a link or the entire story (if it is flash fiction). PM me if you want me to post your work anonymously.

• Last day to post is April 30th!

I'm also thinking that if this contest runs all year, I'll create an archive of all our 2021 genre fiction stories. It would be sort of like a rational fiction anthology. :)

That's all guys! Start writing!

  Today was the last day of Passover, so in lieu of actually doing anything related to the holiday, I wrote a short story about the plagues from the perspective of the then-Pharaoh, showcasing the real reason he kept changing his mind.

    This was great, and the ending was perfect. Well done!

  I sighed. "Alright. Just - just go over it all again, could you?" I ask.

  "Again, sir?" asks James.

  "Yes. Both of you. And help me push that bookcase in front of the door, will you?"

  "...alright, sir. You, um, you know the Defictionaliser?"

  "I've only been in charge of the project for the last five years, James. Yes, I *know* the Defictionaliser. And that's *still* a stupid name."

  Accurate, though. The entire purpose of the Defictionaliser is to turn fictional things real; it uses some horrendously complicated mix of neural networks and hard-light holograms and several other bits which I'd swear not even the scientists working on the project - James and Tom -even remotely understand. Oh, there's a whole host of caveats - it won't work on living people, the Defictionalised items evaporate within about half an hour after being Defictionalised (along with anything that those objects created) and there's some sort of complexity limit which means it can't bring forth any AI more advanced than the ones we're already using - oh, and it takes enough power to supply half the continent for two months every time we turn it on.

  "Well, sir," says James, "it's like this. We thought we'd found a way around the no-living-creatures issue that we'd been having. I mean, just think, if we could bring back famous historical figures for half an hour each! Surely that would -"

  "Fictional *versions* of famous historical figures," I say firmly, "which can't tell us anything about the real person they were based on that we couldn't find out from reading their books."

  "...well, *yes*," admits James. "I realise that *now*."

  "So... what was your incredible way to get living people?" I ask, both knowing and dreading the answer.

  "The Prose Portal!" says James enthusiastically. "From the Thursday Next series. It's a fictional device for visiting fictional worlds, and it *doesn't* have a living-creatures limit!"

  "No," I say, "but it also *uses* living creatures, doesn't it? The bookworms?"

  "Ah. You looked it up already?" he asks.

  "*Months* ago." I shake my head. "So how did you get around *that?*"

  "Oh, that wasn't a problem. I just typed up a copy of the relevant chapters, changed every reference to the bookworms to specify that they were *robotic* worms, and then I used *that* version to Defictionalise from."

  "Uh-huh. And you didn't think to try to make robots of the actual *people* you were after in the first place because...?"

  "That would fall foul of the complexity limit, sir. People are complex enough to be beyond modern AI. But worms, worms are *not*. So it all works, right?"

  James' hopeful smile is kind of spoiled by the sound of a double shotgun blast. Sounds like he's getting closer.

  "Right," I say. "Brilliant. I'll make sure that, when we have to explain why we lost several millions worth of massively expensive equipment, that everyone knows *exactly* who to blame."

  James sags.

  "So. You got your robotic Prose Portal," I continue. "You know that anything you produce with it would fade at the end of the half hour when it did, right?"

  "Right!" agrees James. "So it's not like we could use it to fetch the Queen of England or anything. She'd be devastated that she only had half an hour to go."

  There's some distant yelling. It almost sounds like something about 'born groans'.

  "Of course," I sigh. "You wanted to maintain a decent ethical stance, didn't you?"

  "Yes!" says James. "So we went for someone who explicitly didn't *care* about things like his own long-term survival or whether or not he was a real person; but who was not, at that particular point in his story, in any very immediate danger. Because, um, we'd need to go *into* his book to get him, and -"

  "So you got some angry old man who would smash his way through all our equipment, almost kill us, and ruin the Defictionaliser completely instead?"

  "...um," says James, nervously.

  "Who *did* you pull into reality, anyway?" I ask.

  James takes a deep breath. "His name is Old Man Henderson..."
