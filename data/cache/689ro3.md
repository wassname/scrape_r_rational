## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  You discover that you have Super Strength!  You can lift a car over your head.  

  Having read TV tropes, you realize that lifting the car implies some sorts of secondary powers.

  What experiments do you try?  

  How would you use strength (and possible secondary powers) in a super hero fight?  How can you exploit it outside of combat, if you just wanted money or political power?

    I'd build a really heavy shield and see if it becomes stronger than the material would be alone. Same for a really heavy armor. 

    I'd also test to see if wearing really heavy armor would make me sink through the ground or not. 

    Next I would experiment with mechanical advantage - using leverage and gears to see if I can build something like a hand-cranked railgun or laser. Pull big lever with super-strength, use a mechanism reinforced by secondary power involving leverage and gear ratios to eventually spin a generator at tremendous speeds. Or mechanically launch a projectile somehow. Or spin a big saw blade... projectile. 

    A big enough lever could maybe allow me to hand-press carbon into diamonds.

    For fights I would use heavy armor, shield, some kind of sword and a really big multipurpose gun (laser, railgun, regular guns) that can only be operated with super strength (hand-cranked and intentionally built with weak components that will fail (violently) if fired without secondary power). 

    A hand-cranked generator as per above is connected to electrodes on the outside of the armor, so I can electrocute grappling opponents and still be water safe. 

    My hands can obviously take a lot of abuse when gripping and lifting a car, so I would test if I can (finger) punch through stuff.

    I test my personal toughness.  I know that I can survive pressures of about 20 PSI on my hands that it takes to lift a car without injury.  How do I fare against the 1200 PSI of a boxer's punch?  The ~8000 PSI of a baseball bat?  The even higher pressure of stopping a bullet?  Does it apply to non-kinetic things like heat or chemicals?  

    I test if I have touch-telekinesis.  I slap together an accelerometer out of a rubber band and a small weight, and test what happens when I pick it up (attached to an object or not) and when I quickly move it.  Depending on the results of those tests, I buy a real accelerometer and repeat them.  I also stand on a scale while lifting weights to check that aspect.  If I have a trusted friend, I check if it is manton-limited as well.  If I don't have a trusted friend, I test it on a mouse instead to do the same test, but worse.

    I test my effect on mechanisms.  Buy five 40:1 geared speed-increasers and test feed them into each other to eventually make a 102400000:1 gearbox, stick a flywheel on the end, and slowly crank the handle.  (Test with one, then two, then three then four then five.)  Avoid relativistic edge-velocities on the flywheel for now, but consider going to CERN or something later if the gearbox works.  

    Can I lift myself by the bootstraps and fly?  

    What happens if I oppose my body's strength with another part of my body?  For example, grabbing a finger and then trying to make a fist.

    The superhero and civilian applications really depend on the outcomes of the tests.  The common threads for superhero work are boring and involve punching people, and the common civilian applications are related to space.  I don't see any obvious applications in politics if you aren't going for a coup or using your money to fund yourself.

  You're Percy Jackson Lite, in a world of superheroes.

  You have short range (>50ft) water control, and can comfortably control 2 liters of water.

  It takes roughly five seconds to form a glob of water into a shape, and you can move water around at about human walking speed. 

  As far as other powers (turning water into ice, condensing water from vapor in the air, purifying water) they are possible, but require practice. Any aspect of the power can be improved upon, be it total volume of water controlled, movement speed, range, etc.

  As far as limitations go, you can only control what is thematically water. Ocean water is fine, lake water is fine, but something like orange juice would be impossible. Only if you could look at it and go "yeah, that's water" could you control it.

  How do you grow your power into something that will allow you to survive in a world of super-powered maniacs?

    Since humanity is still around, the general populace has a decent survival rate, so doing nothing is the base point that strategies have to do better than.

    Is there a maximum amount of force I can apply? Try stopping a blob of water that is already moving faster than walking speed, see what happens if you make water in a pot on the ground go downwards at walking speed, and see if drenching yourself, perhaps in more absorptive clothes, lets you fly, or at seem to weigh less.

    How complex are shapes allowed to be? With some colors thrown in, sufficiently fine translation of your thoughts and a camera might allow you to produce an animated motion picture in a few hours.

    Orange juice bending might be unlocked by practicing control on a drop of orange juice diluted in progressively less water.

  * **d)** For one reason or another, moral and ethical issues are not a hindrance in this setting whatsoever — any type of experiment would be seen as acceptable to be designed and launched, in this regard. An outcome of a poorly thought-out dangerous experiment could still cause harm and damage, but there will not be any limitations or risks associated with public outcry, protests, and so on that were caused by the crossing of moral\ethical lines.

  What experiments would your character carry out? In fields of biology, neurology, psychology, sociology, etc. (Inb4: “They would try to find out why are people here so apathetic about morality and ethics by doing X and Y.”)

    Did this humanity start out with that attitude, and has its leader always had this power? A hypothesis that someone might soon come up with is that God made us as a science generator, which is essentially true.

    Annoyingly, the correct path is putting all the research into FAI, followed by the universe getting a surprisingly high science output. But let me steal from [That Alien Message](http://lesswrong.com/lw/qk/that_alien_message/):

    > (Oh, and every time someone in this world tries to build a really powerful AI, the computing hardware spontaneously melts.  This isn't really important to the story, but I need to postulate this in order to have human people sticking around, in the flesh, for seventy years.)

    World-wide coordination should make everything efficient enough to get most of the workforce available for the Science project. Initially, research into reduction of the workforce needed to sustain the rest takes priority - genetic food enhancement, say. Long-term, research into the ability of humans to carry out Science would be important - genetic intelligence enhancement, say. For the endgame, research whatever counts as the most science points, for example generating math theorems. (How is what I do scored?)

      Sorry, my question was likely not formulated in the best way for what I had in mind. Perhaps I should’ve asked this in Monday rationality or Friday off-topic instead. 

      The question of my interest was “what types of scientific research and experimentation do you think would produce high benefit results if ethical and moral restrictions weren’t an issue?” — or something like that. I was trying to surround that with a setting that would allow the “players” to focus on the question.

      Maybe another way of making it more accurate would be to introduce a [ceteris paribus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceteris_paribus) condition. That is, in one AU points "a)", "b)", "c)" hold true, while in another there’s also the "d)" — and the question is how to capitalise on the difference that "d)" introduces when “competing” with universe A.

      ---

      Regarding your solution to *this* question: can you elaborate on what you meant by genetic food (GMOs?) and intelligence enhancements (e.g. embryo gene manipulation, eugenics, etc)?

      And regarding the FAI plan, wouldn’t taking that path from the start be rather dangerous? If it gets out of your control in a manner that you or your scientists can’t comprehend yet, it would pretty much ruin your whole setting in several turns.

  Your whole life is a ["Groundhog Day" Loop](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogDayLoop): When you die, you're "reincarnated" into your own body in the past, and your life restarts from the beginning. Can you use this ability to take over the world?

    As usual with these, the first AGI that appears in the loop captures me and brainwashes me into remaking it after a reset or keeps me alive beyond human scope, depending on its decision theory.

    Do brainscans find a developed brain? Are brain damage, diseases, mental trauma, addictions, motor skills, language skills etc. transmitted?

    What happens to the timeline I left? Is it conceivable that there are other time travellers, or that left-behind timelines may eventually discover a way to follow me?

    Acquire a reliable method of suicide. On the second go-through we could acquire money by knowing where to invest, which is used to excentrically buy information that people claim would have allowed us to convince them of our powers. On the next run use the credibility that gives us to blackmail the world with its deletion, if that's how that works.

    - u/OutOfNiceUsernames:

      > Are brain damage, diseases, mental trauma, addictions, motor skills, language skills etc. transmitted?

      I’d also be interested to check if my brain changes physically after the information transfer. In what manner does it change, to what extent, how is a child’s brain being able to losslessly accept a grown-up person’s consciousness, etc. Another question is how “positive” changes (e.g. the “natural” development of my consciousness through the iterations) are recognised and separated from negative ones (brain tumors, memory loss illness, brain’s deterioration with age, etc), because such differentiation would likely imply the existence of some intelligence or “program” on a higher scale that’s controlling the resets and my ripple effect-proof memory.

      >What happens to the timeline I left? Is it conceivable that there are other time travellers, or that left-behind timelines may eventually discover a way to follow me?

      How would you go on about finding out answers to these questions? One test I can think of is brainwashing a small group of other people in one iteration, and then observing them in the next one. Outside of that — without being able to navigate in the higher dimension (suppose research into sideways or vertical dimension travel each time returns nothing) — I think it would be impossible for any of the theories regarding other iterations you’ve left to get enough supporting proofs.

      >Acquire a reliable method of suicide. 

      Yeah, for some reason almost all stories that deal with [GroundhogPeggySue](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogPeggySue) keep ignoring this important bit.

      Also, what would a reliable suicide switch look like? Dangers to consider: getting drugged by something subtle, getting your body or brain compromised with nano-machines (gradual changes in personality and behaviour that would likely go unnoticed by the trigger), getting compromised in some way that would reveal itself only in long-term, etc.

      Also, what would you do about dangers like depression, apathy, addiction (in case it *is* being transferred), gradual — but eventually radical — change of moral values, principles, worldview, personality, etc?
