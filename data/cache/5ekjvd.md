## Rationality: From AI to Zombies; Part C

### Post:

Alright: discussion post 2.  First post is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5cn7s4/d_rationality_ai_to_zombies_intros_and_parts_a_b/); second verse is substantially same as the first, the only main difference being that it's only one part this time as opposed to two-plus.  Please do revisit the previous thread for comments on anything from the intros thru part b, or to download the book.

Past that: have at!
