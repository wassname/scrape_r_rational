    God damn it, that's probably it.

  Sweet Moses. The worldbuilding and and characters and meta commentary keep evolving. This is a trip and a half.

  I keep saying that I have no idea what is going to happen next, *but I have no idea what is going to happen next*. Every update is something the completely re-contextualizes everything that came before, while at the same time never making any of the twists meaningless.

  The next chapter could have Mahuika ignite her vape pen like a lightsaber and l would nod along. It could be 8000 copies of the letter 'q', with the capitalization encoding the real chapter. It could be Charlie talking directly to the reader, asking to be made real. A time travelling Willy Wonka might show up to reveal how everything was a part of his plan, and give a 100 page lecture on the subtle programming intricacies of GAG.

  I don't have any clue, and I'm loving it.

  As an aside, is the pickle on the street referencing something? I *think* its a Rick and Morty reference, but my reference pool has proven to be far too shallow to keep up with all the details this story keeps slipping in.
  ```

  - u/OnlyEvonix:
    ```
    It could be a Rick and Morty episode beginning with Morty(Charley) escaping and meeting up with Rick(Wonka) and then Rick pulls the plug on the GAG, extinguishing an entire realm of thinking beings for personal convenience, again. Though considering the average cosmos in this story and the show that might usually be the ethical option. After that it's a normal fan made Rick and Morty episode. Next in rapid succession the author posts a literal transcription of seasons two and three. After the last episode there's Morty on a blank stage, screaming invectives against various real and hypothetical powers, gradually homing in on our society, the authors of the show, this author and us the reader and finally the particular reader reading the chapter at that moment, the end of the chapter is open ended and the beginning is ambiguous. This allows it to cleanly loop when the author posts an identical chapter the next week. A bot is set up to post another every week for eternity.

    Street Pickle has to be a pun for something, but hell if I know what.
    ```

    - u/IICVX:
      ```
      u/Cifems above suggested "Roald Dahl -> Road Dill", which is my current favorite.
      ```

    - u/WalterTFD:
      ```
      Well, the Genie chapter had this:

      &#x200B;

      "Fine. Might as well make the most of whatever I have left, then. There were multiple facts that I always wanted to know, and now I guess I can know them, if you don't mind obliging."  "Not at all. Go ahead."  "Is there somebody in charge of everything? I always wondered about that."  Cleo received a vision of a pickle on a dark street.  "Hm. Is it possible for me to make a complaint?"  Cleo did not receive a vision.

      &#x200B;

      So it seems to literally be a pickle on a street.  Doesn't mean it can't be a pun, but it's also probably literal.
      ```

  ```
  I felt like part of this chapter was meta commentary on rationalists  fan fiction abandoning characterization in favor of particular actions.
  ```

  - u/The_Wadapan:
    ```
    this seems like one of the right lenses to view that sequence through, but I think you're looking at it from the wrong direction! The "actions" model roughly maps to *things-happen* storytelling, which was one of the motivating factors for rational fiction as I understand it, which sought to replace that model with one where characters behave "realistically" and their actions are a product of their motivations. From there, you can go even more simulationist and construct the world first, then see what sort of people end up populating that world, before finally seeing what their actions are, and that's what Teavee describes as his ideal
    ```

    - u/tjhance:
      ```
      I think that 'focusing on actions over characters' is a potential failure mode of any genre, rational or not. (By 'failure mode', I just mean that any fic can have this problem if it's written badly, not that it is an inherent problem of the genre.) Just as, uh, 'non-rational' fic can have characters running around with idiot balls for the sake of the plot that the author wants, lots of self-proclaimed 'rational' fic too can have paper-thin robot characters acting optimally all the time without any insight into their values, thinking process, or how their actions affect their psyche.
      ```

      - u/The_Wadapan:
        ```
        for sure? I wasn't saying that "stuff happens" is solely the domain of quote-unquote nonrationalfic, just that one of rational fiction's stated goals is to specifically avoid it (whether or not it generally succeeds is a different matter, you describe a common failure mode), though that's veering a little close to Sidebar Description Discussion. Michael makes the observation about robotic characters too ("machines that caused actions"), and really he's talking about *good stories* in general, it just so happens that he's framing it in a way that it resembles discussions about *rational stories*

        which, come to think of it, is a really common device in Remy's writing: a generalised theme or a point that makes sense in-universe is communicated using terms that really resemble a specific out-of-universe thing, while also plausibly just being what's happening on a story level. So a given beat could simultaneously be in-universe text about what's happening, plus subtext about a general point, plus metatext about the story
        ```

    - u/scruiser:
      ```
      Yeah I think this fits better than my original interpretation.  I guess I am used to Roald Dahl characters explaining how the modern world has screwed things up (kids watching too much TV), that I assumed the rant had to have negative connotations.
      ```

  - u/CouteauBleu:
    ```
    You fool! Subtext analysis makes it more powerful! Stop before you doom us all!

    (also, I think that specific interpretation is a bit of a stretch)
    ```

- u/jordroy:
  ```
  All i can say, really, is... what the fuck? This story is impressively bizarre.
  ```

- u/gryfft:
  ```
  Christ, the depth of the Dahl lore is unceasing. I loved all the titles, but *AN ADVAN* the most.

  Teavee. Of course it's him.

  Also, I'm usually the guy rolling up my sleeves for the "teleportation isn't murder" side of the argument, but knowing Wonkatech... there's probably a good bit of murder.

  I love the metacommentary. I love the simulation theory. All of this is for a GAG. A pickle runs everything. (Wonka didn't turn himself into a pickle.)

  Bucket wants to leave by way of the formula. The god of candy longs only for death?

  Minusland and the Gnoolies are canon from Great Glass Elevator, but I just wanna say I get Evangelion vibes from the idea of descending below Minusland to meet the avatar of the GAG.

  Gazemaize, I just wanna say this whole story has been stylish as fuck. Dark, fresh, and imaginative. I'm on the edge of my seat.
  ```

  - u/CeruleanTresses:
    ```
    Would you mind explaining the AN ADVAN reference? My Dahl game isn't strong enough.
    ```

    - u/gryfft:
      ```
      The other items on the list were more Dahlian. That one is the followup to *A BEGINNERS GUIDE TO TRUNCA*.
      ```

      - u/CeruleanTresses:
        ```
        Ooooh! That's hilarious.
        ```

  - u/OnlyEvonix:
    ```
    I mean in this case it can be measured and found that in that case it's objectively murder.
    ```

    - u/gryfft:
      ```
      Oh, I'm positive it's murder regardless of whether there are forms of teleportation that aren't murder.
      ```

- u/WalterTFD:
  ```
  He sent him a basketball.  Wow.  The sheer, bloody minded pettiness.
  ```

  - u/CouteauBleu:
    ```
    I read this line, thought nothing of it, and then I did a double-take.

    That line is amazing.
    ```

  - u/multi-core:
    ```
    I didn't even realize what that was referencing until I saw your comment.
    ```

  - u/RiD_JuaN:
    ```
    Do you mind explaining it to a flatbrain like me?
    ```

    - u/royishere:
      ```
      Tall people are often told they should play basketball.
      ```

  ```
  >...and a fishbowl with a small green crystal inside of it.  It was glowing.

  I'm 95% sure that this is a reference to the glowing green crystals that kicked off the events of James and the Giant Peach.  That said, I don't have a single clue what it means.  What would Mike want with the crystal?  Why is it sitting in a fishbowl?  Does it have anything to do with the pickle?  So many questions...
  ```

- u/Badewell:
  ```
  ...huh.

  I need to read this again but to save people the google Track 11 on the album Violence from Nothingface is [Everlasting Godstopper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violence_(Nothingface_album\)) which is pretty metal.
  ```

  - u/IICVX:
    ```
    In case you missed it (like I did the first time) that's god as in deity, not gob as in mouth.
    ```

- u/None:
  ```
  i still have trouble believing this exists
  ```

- u/CouteauBleu:
  ```
  Simulation theory gets a *little* too meta for me (it's kind of a get-out-of-worldbuilding-free card), but I still liked this chapter.
  ```

  - u/IICVX:
    ```
    What's kinda mindbending (and the webcomic 1/0 explores this, too) is that, for a character in a story, simulation theory _is_ accurate.
    ```

    - u/CouteauBleu:
      ```
      That's not really mindbending, that's the problem with breaking the 4th wall.

      Like, Deadpool and Rick & Morty get away with doing it because they're supposed to be funny and to break expected genre conventions, but these genre conventions exist for a reason. If you have no fourth wall at all, then the story is less interesting because *of course* the story is fictional and anything in it can happen and there's no stakes and emotional impact and character growth because it's all just words on paper.
      ```

      - u/Flashbunny:
        ```
        There's a difference between a proper simulation that follows internal rules and words on a page - those wacky things can't happen unless someone outside starts screwing with the simulation for some reason. Though I suppose there's an argument that rational fiction also adheres to simulation enough for this purpose?
        ```

- u/xamueljones:
  ```
  I wonder if Charlie Bucket is a character with more or less facts than the children. He at first seemed like a flat character when the children were driving the story in the earlier chapters, but with every death he showed more facets and appeared to be more complex. Almost as if he is a vampire-like character that feeds off the complexity of the other characters.

  A potential clue about the pickle might be found in Roald Dahl's *Revolting Recipes* book and its sequel, *Even More Revolting Recipes*. They are two books with recipes on how to prepare any of the foods found in his books, but I've never read them and have no idea if there's any mention of pickles in them. Anyone own a copy and care to help?
  ```

  - u/IICVX:
    ```
    Bucket is a character with facts from outside the GAG. I wonder how that impacts him.
    ```

- u/aponty:
  ```
  This is precisely why I spend the entire day refreshing the page on r/rational
  ```

- u/SciresM:
  ```
  This story is absurdly better than I had hoped, and I was loving it by the end of bar I.

  Thank you, /u/gazemaize -- this is quickly becoming one of my favorite stories full stop.
  ```

  ```
  Oh, the agony of seeing "SALT, NOT SWEET: WHY I POLITELY TURNED WILLY WONKA DOWN ON HIS OFFER TO INHERIT HIS BILLION DOLLAR COMPANY, EVEN AFTER HE BEGGED ME" and then Marama picking up and reading an unrelated book after it. What the fuck does that mean. An heir that wasn't Charlie? Charlie wrote it but got sucked back in? Mentions salt, the thing that abstracts you closer to the admin level?

  This story is so fucking good.
  ```

  - u/ThePyrokineticGuy:
    ```
    it's likely veruca salt's autobiography making false claims about the events of the factory and the outcome of the contest
    ```

    - u/IICVX:
      ```
      Ya that was explicitly called out in one of the IRC segments - Salt's autobiography is not considered a good source even in-fiction.
      ```

  - u/IICVX:
    ```
    >Mentions salt, the thing that abstracts you closer to the admin level?

    Ugh and therefore by insane moon logic, sweets would make you more concrete and thus further away from God / the GAG.

    So Willy Wonka was leading us all to candy coated hell, I guess.
    ```

- u/Massim0g:
  ```
  That was a great Game by God: Sludge Reformation reference. Really drives home the metacommentary theme.
  ```

- u/royishere:
  ```
  I can't decide whether I'm disappointed or relieved that it's looking like Wonka didn't turn himself into a pickle.
  ```

  - u/fljared:
    ```
    I'm still not convinced this isn't just an elaborate Pickle Rick joke, in some form.
    ```

- u/Scilark:
  ```
  This story is... well... I'm not sure what it is. But I know that I like it!
  ```

- u/Gurkenglas:
  ```
  I don't expect it to be a coincidence that he accidentally swallowed three cups of salt. Who caused it? Perhaps the pickle, to make things interesting?
  ```

- u/OnlyEvonix:
  ```
  I just noticed something, it specifies that he's the result of a teleportation-murder. Which implies that even Wonka was actively malicious rather than knowingly reckless.
  ```
