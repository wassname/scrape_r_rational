  Hi there! Try my new Naruto Fanfic, which is all about history/economy and state building in Narutoverse.

  Reborn in Narutoverse as Kurama, reincarnated scientist wants 2 things - power to keep himself free from enslavement and to built liberal oligarchy, will he get what he wants?)

  Ps:But be aware that I am new to this, so, please, don’t judge me strictly!)

  PsPs: It is supposed to be a short story, so be aware of that too)
