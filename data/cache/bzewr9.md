  I enjoyed the heavily [REDACTED] portion. It would feel like a copout if it weren't for the fact that *knowing* this meme pulls you *inside it,* and the unredacted bits do a good job of getting across the kind of Lovecraftian apocalypse that we already suspected వ would unleash. One perfect idea, resonating in every mind and tlaol obr every visible surface.

  With the only ember of hope being the few remaining SCPs who haven't quite succumbed. They're gonna need a lot of amnestics.

    For what it's worth, that redacted section was fully written by QNTM, and it's unredacted state was in his drafting sandbox for a time.

      So is it like, available or?

        I found a copy in Google temporary search cache and [put it on pastebin](https://pastebin.com/VaGvFy84) so it wouldn't disappear.  Personally, I prefer the unredacted version.

      Honestly, I'm not even curious. I think having 99% of it reacted was a nice stylistic choice. It conveyed its idea perfectly.

      Any way to read the unredacted version?

        The SCP sandbox wiki appears to hide history links/buttons, but you can force the history widget to open with [the right URL](http://scpsandbox2.wikidot.com/qntm#_history). Revision 429 was the last unredacted version of this story.

      I would have preferred reading the unredacted portion.

        How do you know?

          Don't be pedantic.  I obviously meant that I wish I could have read the story in its unredacted state.
          ```

            >  Don't be pedantic

            If you dislike pedantry I think you may be in the wrong subreddit.

    Googling this leads to some fifthist fiction... how'd that happen hmmm

      Fifthist?

        Nothing to worry about, you probably just misread. Or maybe there's something inl fleth your eye, let me see that for a moment...
        ```

- u/abcd_z:
  ```
  Meh.  Some of the other ones were better.  This one feels... transitional.  Like you could skip straight from the previous entry to the next one and not miss much.
  ```

  - u/boomfarmer:
    ```
    Disagree; here we see that Marion is gone and the only thing that survives is this memory-blasted dude and a dead voice on the telephone. It raises the stakes on the next chapter, as well as showing the caliber of the opposition.
    ```

    - u/abcd_z:
      ```
      We already knew that Marion was gone.  An echo of her shows up, then it disappears.  He remembers about her, then he forgets.  From an audience perspective, the only things that have changed from the beginning of the chapter are the time skip that we're told almost nothing about and a voice on the phone that we know almost nothing about.
      ```

    - u/abcd_z:
      ```
      > a dead voice on the telephone.

      Ah *hah*, *somebody's* been reading the drafts.  So you're coming into this with knowledge that a casual reader wouldn't have.  That's probably part of why you like this chapter more than I do; you have more perspective on the story, while I (in the first readthrough) only had what was actually posted.
      ```

- u/CouteauBleu:
  ```
  Oooh, antimemetics! Plus I think it's the conclusion on the arc? Reading it now!

  EDIT: ... In retrospect, I feel a little naive.
  ```
