## Need Help Finding a Short Story

### Post:

A while ago I read a short story about a piece of computronium that fell to the Earth and caused the construction of the tower of babel by whispering architectural instructions to humans holding it. The story also featured a medieval society/monastery constructing an android which exploded due to computing too hard but was seen as being smote by god. I'm not certain if I got some of these details wrong but I really want to find the story. Help?
