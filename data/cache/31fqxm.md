  I wish that all wishes whose fulfilment would go against my values as of (the day before), not counting any retroactive alterations, would not be fulfilled.
  ```

  ```
  I'd probably assume it was a hoax and not wish for anything coherent.
  ```

- u/literal-hitler:
  ```
  I'd wish for omnipotence.
  ```

    ```
    I was actually thinking of wishing for infinite wishes but yeah, Same effect.

    Gotta go for retroactive omnipotence, going back to the beginning of the countdown. Otherwise, if someone wishes for all wishes to be nullified or for you to die, your wish won't actually go through. This way, you can kill or mute anyone wishing for something that you don't desire.
    ```

      ```
      Ah, yes, retroactively punishing all that did not let you achieve your utility func---

      Fuck.

      Forget I said anything.

      - u/None:
        ```
        Heh. Or at least prevent their wishes from coming true (or mitigate their effects to bring about a future that you would approve of). Killing was just the first thing that came to mind - I don't have a mysterious dark side, I swear.
        ```

    - u/Transfuturist:
      ```
      I would wish for omnipotence, travel back in time, and cause the original event. Any wishes for cancellation would silently fail. The wish that is granted them will actually be a ham sandwich that is very slightly drier than would be optimal. I then proceed to preserve Earth from before the event, and make my way to Singularity from there, constantly making backups. Permutation City, baby.
      ```

  - u/Askspencerhill:
    ```
    I also thought of this, and within 10 seconds.

      As a writer, I feel ashamed of my peers' willingness toward classic storytelling over rational thought :(
      ```

- u/None:
  ```
  IwishIexistedatthebeginningoftheuniverseandwasomnipotent. Phew. Hope I got that in before the cancelation wishes.

  Assuming the wish was granted, I would then run a functional simulation of the current universe up until the present, creating backup copies of every sentient being ever in existence. Then start over, rewriting the laws of physics to eliminate the possibility of death and suffering of sentients, and which allowed every sentient limited omnipotence within their own pocket universe. Oh and of course the ability to travel to other's pocket universes at will, given permission to do so by the owner. Then copy everyone over and relinquish my total omnipotence.

  I think that about covers it. I hope everyone would forgive me for denying their wishes!
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Hmm. I forgot to remove the ability for any wish-granting entities to alter the new laws of physics or grant any other entity the ability to do so. Probably a good idea to do that first.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      Though I might use their wish as a starting seed for their pocket universe!

      Hmm...

  I wish for the result of a wish perfectly worded to allow, despite or cancelling out all the other idiotic wishes made, all of us to reach humanity's CEV.
  ```

  - u/callmebrotherg:
    ```
    Mine was somewhat similar, that nobody's wish be granted in such a way as to counteract any other person's CEV.

  Reddit has long been a hot spot for conversation on the internet. About 57 million people visit the site every day to chat about topics as varied as makeup, video games and pointers for power washing driveways.

  In recent years, Reddit’s array of chats also have been a free teaching aid for companies like Google, OpenAI and Microsoft. Those companies are using Reddit’s conversations in the development of giant artificial intelligence systems that many in Silicon Valley think are on their way to becoming the tech industry’s next big thing.

  Now Reddit wants to be paid for it. The company said on Tuesday that it planned to begin charging companies for access to its application programming interface, or A.P.I., the method through which outside entities can download and process the social network’s vast selection of person-to-person conversations.

  “The Reddit corpus of data is really valuable,” Steve Huffman, founder and chief executive of Reddit, said in an interview. “But we don’t need to give all of that value to some of the largest companies in the world for free.”

  The move is one of the first significant examples of a social network’s charging for access to the conversations it hosts for the purpose of developing A.I. systems like ChatGPT, OpenAI’s popular program. Those new A.I. systems could one day lead to big businesses, but they aren’t likely to help companies like Reddit very much. In fact, they could be used to create competitors — automated duplicates to Reddit’s conversations.

  Reddit is also acting as it prepares for a possible initial public offering on Wall Street this year. The company, which was founded in 2005, makes most of its money through advertising and e-commerce transactions on its platform. Reddit said it was still ironing out the details of what it would charge for A.P.I. access and would announce prices in the coming weeks.

  Reddit’s conversation forums have become valuable commodities as large language models, or L.L.M.s, have become an essential part of creating new A.I. technology.

  L.L.M.s are essentially sophisticated algorithms developed by companies like Google and OpenAI, which is a close partner of Microsoft. To the algorithms, the Reddit conversations are data, and they are among the vast pool of material being fed into the L.L.M.s. to develop them.

  "I wish that I, and nobody else, will gain omnipotence" and then just hope there isn't someone named nobody else.
  ```

- u/Nepene:
  ```
  I wish to override any meta wishes in this wish, and any meta meta wishes, and any meta meta meta wishes, and have only my wish come true where I would gain the ability to do new wishes at will with no restrictions and with the wishes coming true perfectly according to my intent and desire.
  ```

- u/Evilness42:
  ```
  I wish to be omnipotent, [completely immortal as defined by Tv Tropes](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompleteImmortality), and completely unaffected by wishes that contradict this wish and the results of wishes that contradict the results of this wish. There. 

  That *should* deal with the wishes for no wishes, and should also deal with other omnipotent entities popping up that may or may not try to kill me. Omnipotence means you can do anything, so that technically means you can destroy other omnipotent entities. But if you do a wish that includes being incapable of dying... But omnipotence means you can do anything and that means that doesn't... You know what, I'm giving myself a headache thinking about this. I'm just not even going to *try* anymore. Ugh.

  **Assuming I think it's a hoax:**

  I probably *do* think it's a hoax, but the magical-seeming light and disembodied voice would at least put me in a mind-state to consider that Everything I Know Is Wrong. What's the worst-case scenario for participating, versus the worst-case scenario for *not* participating? I'd participate, just 'cause the cost isn't too bad even if it's a hoax.

  **Assuming I know everyone in the world is getting this same opportunity**:

  Most of the folks in this thread are wishing for omnipotence in one way or another. What is the result of two omnipotent entities existing? I can think of two models:

  - Omnipotent entities can destroy each other (or at least render each other non-omnipotent), in which case *properly using* omnipotence is sort of a game of winning initiative. 

  - Omnipotent entities are immune to other omnipotent entities. For reasons, this results in a paradox; if this is how omnipotence works then only one omnipotent being may exist in any given reality.

  How does the mystical force deal with contradictions? I don't think it is possible to figure this out in the timeframe alloted, but I can think of several models for this; there may be others:

  - Whoever gets their wish in FIRST gets it, anything that contradicts this is null and void
  - Any contradicting wishes are nullified on both sides
  - The wish-source tries to maximize the number of wishes fulfilled and nullifies the smallest number of wishes that may be nullified in order to achieve this goal
  - The wish-source gets as close as it can to fulfilling every wish, averaging them out in what it somehow considers to be a 'fair' manner (e.g. if 2 people wish to be omnipotent-and-immune-to-other-omnipotents, the result is they are both extremely powerful nigh-omnipotent beings but not quite omnipotent)

  Hm.

  I don't trust the vast vast majority of people to be omnipotent in a safe way. Destruction is much easier than creation, and whatnot. I'm not even sure I trust *myself* with that kind of power, and I trust 99.9999% of the population even less (not 'cause I estimate myself more than all-but-one-in-a-million, but 'cause I, at least, would align things along my own values, whereas with Everybody Else I have to deal with the *combined* factors that their values are different, and also, they may not be smart enough to wish/enact properly)

  There's a lot of information about How This Works that we cannot know. There's a lot of ways this could end in disaster -- way more than actually achieving humanity's CEV, if there is such a thing.

  My personal inclination when this sort of thing comes up -- with such a small timeframe for reflection, anyway -- is to, *as quickly as possible*, **wish for everybody else's wish to be cancelled.** I've worked this out ahead of time because of similar prompts to this, so I think I could get this in *pretty early*. Maybe wouldn't beat the other 7 billion people in the world, but could beat most of them.

  In *some* of the potential scenarios for how this could work, this saves everybody from themselves. If it's "nullify the smallest number of wishes" then I've just nullified myself and we are probably screwed. If it's "average out in the interest of greatest fairness" then I've helped a little bit, but we are still probably screwed. But, I'm not sure what I could do better in such a small time period.

  **Assuming I don't know everyone in the world is getting this same opportunity, and I think it's only myself:**

  - Can I wish for more wishes? 

  Usually not, but we don't have that information. My gut feeling is that using one wish to wish for more than one wish would 'fizzle' somehow, and it would be lost. It would not necessarily work this way, but I would have to work on *some* assumption.

  But I feel like using one wish to wish for one wish -- that might work.

  I wish for another wish to be granted to me after three days. That'll give me more time to think about just how this is gonna work.

  My thirst thought was to wish that no one else's wish would come true, because of the untold havoc everyone would create, and was relatively happy to see that as the main response. However, I was wondering if there was a better wish than this.

  So, let's discuss. Bonus points if you actually give yourself only 10 seconds to think of something.

          Presumably, whoever says it first gets it, and then everything after that depends on them. 

          Really, everything is going to depend on whoever comes up with a significant wish. For example, let's assume the first million people wish for money or the resurrection of a family member, etc. - not really significant wishes in the long run. But if the million-and-first wish is that no wishes come true, the game is over. Or if the million-and-first wish is that they're omnipotent, then no subsequent meta-wishes will most likely affect that new god, but all other wishes do depend on those meta-wishes. It's all pretty random at that point.

          Edit: I wish there was a way this post could time how long it takes for each poster's response. It'd be more interesting to see, sort of a model of how it might happen in real life. For example, /u/literal_hitler wishes for omnipotence at 8.2 seconds. Unfortunately for him, /u/Igigigif wished for arbiter-ship over wishes at 4.4 seconds and rejects this wish... but lets /u/JackStargazer wish to allow us to reach humanity's CEV. Be interesting to see what the final result would be.
