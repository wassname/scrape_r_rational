Marked for Death is an RPG-style story set in a rational reimagining of Naruto, where thread participants vote to control the actions of a single player character - part of a ragtag group of missing-nin, exiles who have come together to help each other survive against everything the world can throw at them.


The first chapter is [here,](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/marked-for-death-a-rational-naruto-quest.24481/) and the story-only thread (if you’d like to get caught up quickly) is [here.](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/posts/4993131/) There’s also a [guide to voting](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/posts/6283682/) put together by Twofold, one of the thread participants. Drop by and join us in a world where death lurks around every corner, and where anything is possible for those with the cunning and determination of a true ninja. 

The story updates every Thursday (u/Velorien of [Lighting Up the Dark](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9311012/1/Lighting-Up-the-Dark)) and Sunday (u/eaglejarl of [Team Anko](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11087425/1/Team-Anko), [2 Year Emperor](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3xe9fn/ffrt_the_two_year_emperor_is_back_and_free/) and [Induction](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3294457/give_aways/Induction/chapter_001.html)).

  >Just out of curiosity, let me try something:

  >Hey, all lurkers: would you please make one post, either here or on the most recent MfD Reddit thread, stating that you read this? I'm curious how many are out there.

  >(If you wanted to add more information, that would be great but definitely isn't required. Good options would be why you prefer not to post (too complicated? too fast-moving? something else?) and how you found us in the first place.)

  I read this! First found it from a post on the subreddit, shortly after it began. (The thing I remember from when I first caught up was Wakahisa's limb-grafting bloodline getting vetoed). I'd enjoyed other works from the quest authors, so I gave it a look, then kept giving it a look every couple days or so.

  As for why I lurk: ~~lupchanzen are responsible~~ I tend to read much more than I post in general, so it's mostly force of habit. If I saw some low-hanging fruit that everyone else was missing, I'd post it, but the thread goers are quite attentive. (I'm definitely willing to interfere if a joke plan ever resurfaces, though).

      Thanks for speaking up. Nice to get some names to attach to the view counts. :>
