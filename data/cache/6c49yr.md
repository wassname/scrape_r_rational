    Correct link is https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/69/Mother-of-Learning - they left the www off.

    Not sure why they posted a link to an old chapter though.

      They left the www off because they delete it from a mobile a evidenced by their removed submission

  This chapter went up over a week ago, and there is already a pretty active [discussion thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/69udy7/rt_mother_of_learning_chapter_69_ruin/?st=j2w1f5j6&sh=5e4cf8f2). Unless I'm missing something, I don't think there's any reason for this post?
