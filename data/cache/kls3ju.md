## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  Thanks to whoever linked that Harry Potter/Lord of the Rings story in this thread last week, I'm really enjoying it. 

  Honestly this is the first year I think I've enjoyed fan fics and stuff on royal road, etc, more than I have published fiction.

  I just finished watching [ANZACS](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088479/), a 1985 mini-series that follows Australian soldiers who served in the [Australia and New Zealand Army Corps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_and_New_Zealand_Army_Corps) (ANZAC) during World War I. It starts right before war breaks out, with the first episode having the main character enlist and go through training before being shipped off to Gallipoli to fight the Turks (not France as they'd expected) as part of the 8th Battalion of the Australian Imperial Force. Following that, we see the major events as the war progresses, such as the battle of the Somme and Ypres, until the war's end in 1918.

  For a series that was made 35 years ago, it holds up surprisingly well. The series deals with WW1 very well, showing the contrast between men on the ground doing the fighting, and those in the rear doing the planning. There are a few major themes that stood out to me: the brotherhood of the soldiers in war, nationalism (Australians view Australia as a nation, the British as an unruly colony), class divides (British officers were mainly old-school nobles, while the foot soldiers were from the lower rungs of society) and Imperialism/jingoism (the main character's pro-British father toasts the war a a "spring breeze to clear the air over Europe"), and the nihilism felt by the troops.

  There only thing I really didn't like was that at some times they would inject comedy in parts I felt should be a bit more serious. I really didn't like the jingle they came up with either. 

  It's mostly historically accurate (as far as I can tell), though there were parts that seemed to take liberties; Haig is portrayed as almost a villain, who sends the Australian men to die in the hopes they'll respect British authority more and is constantly fighting with the PM as much as the Germans (the latter is somewhat true, though the extent of it I'm not sure). I do know that they whitewashed the character of Keith Murdoch, who in real life was lobbied against Major General [John Monash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Monash) taking control of the Australian forces in part because of his Jewish/German heritage, and went as far as spreading lies to the Australian government that senior officers hated Monash, when the opposite was true. 

  It's made in the same vein as *All Quiet on the Western Front* or *Band of Brothers*, though a bit more lighthearted. Definitely a good series for those who like military/history films. 

  As a bonus, it stars some very famous Australians, including Paul Hogan, who would go on to film Crocodile Dundee a year later.

    It's easy to forget but at the start of WWI people went out with swords, cavalry, officers had flashy clothes and many other quirks from pre modern warfare. I was watching a documentary some time ago and before WWI started people were excited about it, they still thought of war as a glorious thing where men fought with honor for their country.

    &#x200B;

    After they started seeing the insane number of casualties, the destruction of artillery and modern weaponry, their opinions and views on war changed..

  Found this a few days ago and enjoyed it. Sapient NPC works around game rules when the player tries to break everything. Some munchkining, interesting cognition from the sapient npcs which are forced into their roles. Pokes fun at common unrealistic elements in RPG’s. Still in progress.

    I'll second that, I read the first 20 chapters the last time it was recced and enjoyed it and now I read the next 20 and it's pretty good.

    I will say that reading it back to back sometimes it can get a bit repetitive, the reminders of previous events, and the circular thinking that doesn't seem to end. I was starting to skim over the internal thought loops that didn't seem to be going anywhere.

    Overall though, great concept, and done pretty well, if you know anything about RPGs you'll get it and can laugh loudly. Curious where it will go.

  A couple questions about whether certain things are still active:

  Is Alicorn's Elcenia setting still being written, or is it dead?

  Is To The Stars (the PMMM fanfic) still being written, or is it dead?

  What about Lighting Up The Dark (the naruto fanfic)?

  Also, is the Wizard's Bane / Wiz Biz series worth reading?
  ```

  - u/chiruochiba:
    ```
    "To the Stars" tends to have long downtimes between chapters. The last chapter upload was just a few months ago, which is not that long relatively speaking, so there's no need to get alarmed or call it dead.

    If you are curious about the update history of the fic, I suggest checking out the related subreddit: r/tothestars

    Elcenia hasn't updated since 2015 and is disclaimed on the author page as "not looking likely to be a priority soon."

    She does have some other fiction out, including [three new stories](http://alicorn.elcenia.com/stories/stories.shtml) of ~50k, ~6k and ~6k respectively all released this year. I personally found Zusan to be kinda adorable.

    Alive and updating slowly, IIRC. I think it had a new chapter in the last month or two, and continues to drop them every few months.

  I took a shot at What's Her Name in Hufflepuff. It turned out to be a much more enjoyable read than I expected. It was pretty much a breath of fresh air in the HP SI fanfics. Are there any HP SI you guys have found to be an enjoyable reads?  

  Azarinth Healer was a decent popcorn read. The plot gets a bit murky after 300 or so chapters and it starts to rinse and repeat in a near xianxia type pattern of unlock location->grind->smack op bosses->return with treasure->repeat.
  ```

  - u/ThePhrastusBombastus:
    ```
    It's not quite an SI, but if you liked Azarinth Healer I could see you liking **[A Wand for Skitter](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-wand-for-skitter.730018/)** too. It's not exactly a masterpiece or anything, but it does feature an out-of-context character mucking about in a moderately-AU version of the Potterverse. I enjoyed it myself, so if you're looking for something to read, feel free to give it a try.
    ```

    - u/Bowbreaker:

  I really want to ask for recommendations, but I can't really choose a specific trope or genre to ask for—there's too much of a variety in fun stuff I have found on this subreddit.

  So instead, here's some works commonly recommended here I liked, found okay, and didn't like. 

  The works I **liked**:

  * HPMoR

  * *Cordyceps*

  * *Mud's Mission*

  * *The Metropolitan Man*

  * Maybe *Octo*, though it's too early to tell

  The works I found **okay**:

  * *The Erogamer* (I prefer it to everything else on this sublist, but not enough to put into the category above)

  * *Mother of Learning* (I enjoyed chapters ~20–~80 a lot but didn't like the rest)

  * *Super Minion*

  * *The World As It Appears To Be*, *Dave Scum*, and other works by Benedict_SC that are not *Cordyceps*

  * The *Antimemetics Division* series on SCP

  * *Chili and the Chocolate Factory: Fudge Revelation*

  The works I **didn't like**:

  * *Time Braid* (I enjoyed it more than everything else on the sublist, but the demon stuff was too much of a turn-off for me)

  * *This Is How You Lose A Time War* (I really wanted to like it but got bored to tears half-way through)

  * *Baru Cormorant*

  * *Never Die Twice*

  * *The Waves Arisen* (probably the only dislike on the list in the category "I regret reading it")

  I couldn't get through the first few chapters of such works as *Purple Days* and *Onwards to Providence* because of the overwhelming number of grammar mistakes in former's case and typos in latter's. 

  I'm looking for something available for free online, but I won't mind published books and such.

  The only restriction is that it should be medium length: not above 150k words but not short enough for its ideas to feel underdeveloped.

  **Edit**: Some elaboration on the list.

  "Liked" are basically the works I tend to randomly get positive thoughts about. They are stories I come back to in my mind, which inspire me and bring enjoyment long after I finished reading them.

  "Okay" are those I enjoyed reading but feel entirely neutral towards after I finished reading them.

  "Didn't like" are the works I didn't enjoy reading, no matter how I feel about them now.

  Some examples of why I liked/okay-ed/disliked something:

  Liked:

  * HPMoR: I loved the characters, especially Harry, Hermione, and Quirrell, but almost all secondary characters as well. I found the plot to be very tight and gripping, and writing to be competent. It's also very funny when it wants to be. I didn't like the ending when it first came out and still stand by this opinion to this day, but I mellowed out and consider it to be merely unsatisfactory now.

  * *Mud's Mission*: I greatly enjoyed how inhuman MC is portrayed and found his antics to be very fun to follow because of that.

  Okay:

  * *The Erogamer*: The meta (both metaphysical and meta-story) shenanigans are incredible, and the character writing is very solid. I found the beginning a tad too slow, and got bored by the end—not sure if the >!rape subplot!< contributed to me dropping the story, but it didn't help. Even though I'm *massively* into that thing in fiction. Make of that what you will.

  * *Chili and the Chocolate Factory: Fudge Revelation*: I feel like the first half is too disconnected from the second half, even though I understand the reason. Overall, it was very competent, but aside from the commentary on this very community, I can't name anything specific that it does exceptionally well.

  Didn't like:

  * *Never Die Twice*: I've made an [extensive explanation](https://reddit.com/r/rational/comments/jig6bi/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/gac2p12/?context=3) on why I don't recommend it.

  * *The Waves Arisen*: Didn't like the concept the story was building up to, didn't like the final confrontation nor the ending, didn't like most of the new character interpretations. Also, at times it felt too dark for the sake of being dark—I understand that it was an attempt to bring plausibility into the world of warring ninjas, but I would've rather redone the world itself than kill off most of the cast. These are the first things that come to mind, but there definitely were more issues.

    If it weren't for length, I'd reccomend Luminosity. It's one of Alicorn's best works and seems to fit in with the ones you liked, but it's 200k words and has another 200k sequel.

    You might like Saga of Soul, but it updates very infrequently.

    You've probably seen branches on the tree of time if you've seen metropolitan man, but in case you haven't its very good too.

    In Memoriam by Shockz hasn't been reccomended here in a while, but it still stands up. I've heard mixed things about how easy it is to get without being familiar with Raildex already, but if you are it's definitely a read and only about 80k.

    Unfortunately, most of the stories I'd reccomend based on what you seem to like are either dead or way more over your cap, so hopefully at least one of these is what you're looking for.
    ```

    - u/NTaya:
      ```
      > Luminosity

      Read it and a half of the sequel. It would be somewhere in the bottom half of the "okay" sublist if I were to put it here. Still, it was very good.

      > Saga of Soul

      If it's not too troubling, can you give me its premise? The webpage didn't tell me much.

      > Branches on the Tree of Time

      I had it on my mental to-read list but not the digital one. Thanks for reminding me, added it to the latter as well.

      > In Memoriam

      I've heard about this one. What makes it good?

      > way more over your cap

      Unfortunately, I'm a bit burned out on large stories for a moment. I  usually look for ones with *more* than 300k words, but a stressful month left me wanting something I can consume in one sitting with a slice of pizza in one hand.

      Thank you very much for your reply!

        Saga of soul is a magical girl story, a type of media that involves young kids, usually girls, with magical powers, a costumed transformation, and fighting villains of some variety or another; there's some overlap with superhero fiction, but they're distinct.  Saga of Soul in specific is a magical girl story with additional emphasis placed on coherent worldbuilding and, if not physical lausibility, at least physical coherence. The core idea is that the MC, Eriko, has a near death experience and returns from her coma with the ability to use magic to create portals, matter, and a few other specifically outlined effects. There's also a strong rational adjacent aesthetic in both the world itself and the main character.


        In Memoriam is a massive AU of the world of A Certain Scientific Index. It has some fantastic worldbuilding and characters, particularly on the magic side, which was (especially early on) a really weak and uninteresting story arc for ToAru, while being obviously recognizable as the same setting with similar rules, albeit with less reliance on bad techno- and magibabble. Characters make creative use of abilities and work intelligently to acheive their goals.

          Thank you for the detailed answer!

          > Saga of soul

          I liked *Puella Magi Madoka Magica*, so this might be interesting. 

          > In Memoriam

          I see. This sounds very interesting! I haven't watched the anime/read the LN, but I know a bit about the setting and characters. A rational rendition is quite welcome.

    Huh. Can you go into more detail on *why* you liked/disliked some of this stuff? I honestly can't really get a good picture of your taste from this. (You like HPMOR, and hate The Waves Arisen? What?)

    With that said, I tentatively recommend [Chili and the Chocolate Factory: Fudge Revelation](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13451176/1/Chili-and-the-Chocolate-Factory-Fudge-Revelation). One of my all-time favorites. Read the Reddit discussion alongside each chapter for the best effect, I think.
    ```

    - u/jozdien:
      ```
      I didn't particularly enjoy The Waves Arisen, and HPMOR is my favourite work of fiction.  It felt like someone read HPMOR and was so infatuated with it they directly copied what they enjoyed into a setting that often doesn't fit at the level they've written it to, and miss out on some of the nuances.  

      Mildly plot-relevant spoiler from toward the end of The Waves Arisen: >!An example of what I mean by the former would be Naruto's summoning animal being a human.  In HPMOR, Harry's patronus being Homo Sapiens both made sense with how Dementors worked (a more sensible interpretation even of just the facts in canon, even), and tied into the larger themes of the story.  In the Naruto world (including that of the fanfic), it feels like a forced stretch.!<

      Very heavy plot spoiler from the end of The Waves Arisen: >!An example of what I mean with the latter is the climax to the final fight when Naruto uses topology to combine chakra in new ways.  In HPMOR, Harry's advantages came from leveraging the power of a scientific civilization centuries ahead of the world of magic.  In The Waves Arisen, he's just an ordinary ninja.  And yet, in the incredibly competitive ninja world where highly trained jonin scramble for any advantage available, none ever related topology to chakra over centuries.  This, along with other similar plot points (like Naruto realizing he'd get the Rinnegan if they opened all their gates) made me give a small measure of credence to the argument against some rational fiction that we change the rules just to buff up our characters.  Stuff like the Eternal Mangekyo's new rules for activating are more sensical interpretations of canon, but stuff like this is changing the world to fit the character buff.!<

      Don't get me wrong, I did like reading it.  There are some very cool moments like >!the entire final fight right up until the end being one of my favourite fights in fiction!< and world-building, like >!the reasoning behind the world map being what it is!<.  But I see people often pointing to Eliezer as the author, and while I can't speak for the level to which he'd obscure his writing to make it not-obvious it's him, I don't think he'd spend his time writing the same very high-level ideas in a different world without changing the low-level details with anywhere near the precision he did in HPMOR.
      ```

      - u/fassina2:
        ```
        Naruto was OP already by that point, more realistically he'd have started the world conquest first, and later been involved with the Rinnegan dude showing up as a response to his actions rather than what happened. 

        &#x200B;

        It'd have been more interesting, seeing the beginning of the conquest, the part with highest chance of encountering problems and difficulty, so that we later could have a final confrontation with a guy nobody knows about that's absurdly powerful, maybe he'd team up with some of the Kages in a coalition against the Naruto Wave.

        &#x200B;

        Much cooler imho. The way the Rinnegan was handled was not perfect though, I agree.
        ```

      - u/Xxzzeerrtt:
        ```
        Iirc the tequnique that Naruto used to open his rinnegan would only work on him and sasuke because of their bloodline, and everyone else used a blood transfusion. It’s been awhile though so correct me if I’m wrong.
        ```

        - u/jozdien:
          ```
          That Naruto would get the Rinnegan isn't something I was in doubt of (Kishimoto actually admitted his mistake in canon with Boruto not awakening one, if I remember correctly).  My peeve was with him having a sudden, unforeseen insight on how to awaken it in the middle of battle by opening all his gates without having to wait decades like Madara did.
          ```

    - u/NTaya:
      ```
      Hm. Give me around an hour, I'll elaborate by then.

      Oh, right, I *have* read *Chili and the Chocolate Factory*. Followed all the updates, even. I would firmly put it into the "okay" category.
      ```

      I updated the comment with some details.

    If you liked Mud's Mission, you might also like [The Crystal Society](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01AYT6A3C) - the first book is definitely good, the second and third books people argue about.
    ```

    - u/NTaya:
      ```
      For some reason, I couldn't get past the very first chapter (after the prologue) on this one for, like, the past year or even longer. There have been five instances where I tried to start reading but couldn't progress. My eyes glazed over the page.

      I really, *really* want to read this one, it's been recommended to me very often, and I love the premise—but I am simply *unable to*.
      ```

      - u/Bowbreaker:
        ```
        The first book of Crystal Society has been made into an audiobook by the same guy (and on the same website) who also did HPMoR. Maybe having it read to you breaks you through that inexplicable block.
        ```

        - u/NTaya:

    If you liked Metropolitan Man you should try Alexander Wales' other works, many of them fit your restriction of "not above 150k words". I'm not sure how short too short is but there are a lot of stories of different lengths you can pick from.

    >I greatly enjoyed how inhuman MC is portrayed

    You might enjoy [Everybody Loves Large Chests](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/8894/everybody-loves-large-chests), [Shade Touched](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/34473/shade-touched), [Artificial Jelly](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/34030/artificial-jelly), and [Threadbare](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/15130/threadbare).

    ELLC and Shade Touched both have some vague rationalist undertones. They both kind of start to drag later on in my opinion, but are still pretty good. Meanwhile, Artificial Jelly and Threadbare aren't really rational at all, and I've not yet finished either, but I find them very enjoyable. 



    >The meta (both metaphysical and meta-story) shenanigans are incredible

    You might get a kick out of the [KUSOMEGA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KojTtZMZm4&ab_channel=Digi) books? Trigger warning for like basically everything, and it's a different brand of meta than Erogamer, but it's pretty well done, and feels a little similar to me at times. Also, if you can't stand the voices used or just don't want to listen to an audiobook, you can also just read the books by opening the google docs linked in the videos descriptions. 


    Oh, and this has nothing to do with anything else, but since I don't see it on your list despite it being a staple of the sub, I guess I'll recommend [Worm](https://parahumans.wordpress.com/2011/06/11/1-1/), though it's of course *way* longer than your 150k limit. I would still recommend it just on the basis that "most people like it" if nothing else, if you happen to find the time.

      > Shade Touched

      When I started reading it a few weeks ago, I thought this is going to be one of my favorite works on RR. For some absolutely inexplicable reason, I dropped it on chapter 37. I absolutely loved reading it, still subscribed, but every time I open the chapter I just can't bring myself to read. Mysterious.

      > Threadbare

      It's on my to-read list, I planned to try it out if I get no replies to this comment.

      > Everybody Loves Large Chests

      Dropped it really early a few months ago for reasons I don't remember.

      > Artificial Jelly

      Will take a look, thanks!

      > KUSOMEGA

      First time hearing about this one. Is it a light novel? I might give it a read right now.

      > Oh, and this has nothing to do with anything else, but since I don't see it on your list despite it being a staple of the sub, I guess I'll recommend Worm

      It's on me for not merging it for the main comment, but I replied to my own post with

      "I'm also aware of many other popular works such as Unsong, Ra, WtC, and Worm but haven't finished them for one reason or the other—even though I plan to. If it's commonly mentioned, I definitely have my eye on it already."

      Thank you a lot for the recommendations! I'll take a look at *Artificial Jelly* and KUSOMEGA.

        Yeah I feel the same about Shade-touched. I guess it might be because of the lack of concrete goal besides "learn more stuff" again and again?

        A Journey of Black and Red is on Royalroad and pretty solid, I'd lump it with Superminion in terms of my enjoyment (which is probs a bit higher than your enjoyment, but eh).

        Humble Life of a Skill Trainer is about a LitRPG teacher (not an isekai tho), Delve is isekai LitRPG with more math than normal, I Don't Want to be the Hive Queen is an "isekai'd into a monster cut off from civilisation" story, Menocht Loop is a "grow magic in time loop" story that skips the first 4 years of groundwork study and gets into the Actual Events. All those stories on Royalroad I would say are worth at least trying.

        There's not much I'd super-recommend right now that isn't already widely known in this subreddit. My strongest recommendation would be for There Is Nothing To Fear, but that's Harry Potter fanfic so your mileage may vary.

          That's what I like, actually! As a person whose goal at life is to "learn more stuff," I liked reading about main character accomplishing that goal effectively. I think, it's the interactions with humans that broke me for some reason.

          > Menocht Loop

          Hated it, sorry. At least in some part because it skipped the groundwork, but also for other reasons.

          > There's Nothing To Fear

          I think I've read everything from the series except *Hermione Granger and the Silent Country*. I don't get what's everyone so crazy about when it comes to this story, but it's quite alright nonetheless. 

          The rest I've heard about, so I might give some of them a try. For now, I'm reading an LN recommended above, but I'll put them on my to-read list, thanks!

            If you're down with LNs of questionable quality, I can add a few more recs.

            Ouroboros Record has been slowly translated for years now. MC gets isekai'd as a noble's kid in a darker than average fantasy world, with his only pick-up from the experience being vague and horrific memories of what his soul felt throughout the process, instead of any "cheat skills." Said experience gives him an incredible phobia of death and the singular ambition of doing research into finding immortality, so as to never experience that process again. It's a good change of pace to have an  single-minded protag, instead of generic isekai harem+demonking-slaying schlock, although the protagonist is decidedly evil, to the point of making inroads into Josef Mengele-esque territory. Also, the first arc is an intro, then there's a very short second arc where the perspective shifts to an pseudo-police investigator looking into the stuff the protag got up to when he went to school by doing a few interviews, and it's a bit of an awkward interlude before everything goes back to normal.

            Translation quality and speed is mediocre. Chapters are decently long, there's about 40 done so far, and there's about another 40 chapters worth of content to go. It got printed from a web novel into 3 light novel volumes that got sold by a small time publisher without making a splash, and then the author vanished into thin air a few years back, so even if the novel does some things that are reasonably interesting, it's not going to be finished. That said, it's still probably sticking on your "to read" list, just at the bottom...

            \-

            Overlord is good, there's a reason it's got several anime seasons, some spin-off content and ended up on lists of best selling Light Novels. That said, the anime gets worse past the first season and you're much better off just reading all the light novels instead. The author is a bit weird, he loves character creation arguably too much, several of the novels have different protagonists instead of the "main character." Out of 14 novels, 4 of them are mostly told by other characters (volumes 4, 7, and 12+13). It's a more unique and novel method than it is particularly good tbh, I mean volume 4 is about a >!lizardman hero uniting a bunch of disconnected lizardman villages to fight against the invasion my the actual main character and his forces, before they get absolutely stomped, !<volume 7 is about >!several teams of adventurers (and one team as the protagonists more or less) sent to check out the main character's base, a tomb that has suddenly appeared in a previously massive and empty plains months earlier, before they all get slaughtered and the main character uses the 'invasion' as a casus belli for his army/country to invade the country that sent the adventurers (after being manipulated to do that in the first place), !<volumes 12 and 13 are better, because Neia is best girl, >!but the story is about the main character having one of his top advisors round up a bunch of monsters to attack another country while disguised, demolish half of it, then for the main character himself to step in, fight off the horde, and save the day. The protagonist, Neia, was a squire to a paladin order who gets handed the role of escort/watcher for the main character because she's the least useful member of the paladins, and she basically starts a religion centred around the main character that becomes a significant power in her home country by the end of the two novels. !<All the characters have their contribution to the world and story, but they generally end up in the background at best once their novel/s are over. Also the fan translations are better than the official ones.

            Dungeon Defense is interesting, it's kinda like a crossover between Code Geass and Overlord. I read the 5 light novels or so ages back, but apparently they took a different direction from the webnovel so there's technically two stories there. It's pretty good, but the author disappeared after it came out a bunch of the speeches from the webnovel (not the light novel though?) were plagiarised from famous speakers, thinkers and philosophers. Whether or not that's a deal breaker is up to you, I'll probably do a light novel reread or webnovel read once I've worked through most of my more pressing reads, because it's still one of the better amateur web/light novels out there, even if the author's pretty much a twat.

              I don't mind such plagiarizing in free web content, but putting it into an LN is a dick move for sure. I might give this one a try anway, the premise sounds mildly intriguing.

  The second story was about this guy in "purgatory" where there's millions/billions of people and every direction of travels are these towers and the whole point of anything/everything was to answers the question if some coffee mug in 1980s/1990s issue of Garfield contained "inappropriate" matter or not.

  The reasons I am recommending it:  It has some really interesting world-building and a look at the world of pokemon that reminds me of pokemon: OOS, but from a more hopeful perspective if that makes sense.  The plot is also interesting and makes sense in the pokemon world.

  Reasons people may not like it:  The MC is not all that rational and the focus is not on gaining power or even being powerful.  The MC is a trans woman and has her problems with the transition, which means the cool world-building is not focused on.  Not a problem for me, but I figure that would frustrate some people.

    [The Last Sovereign](https://the-last-sovereign.blogspot.com/) is this in RPG form. To copy the last time I recommended it here:

    In short it's a smutty rpg about a jaded veteran who gains a sex based power from the same source as the evil overlord who is plaguing his Homeland.

    There's a pretty strong emphasis on sensible decision-making and a use of "soft power" like economics and diplomacy that I've not seen in any rpg, adult or otherwise. The setting is explicitly non rational, but the response to it from the main characters is exactly what anyone from this subreddit might hope for.

    To be honest, I might even go so far as to call it the most rational RPG I can recall playing, even among major franchises, but I'm far from widely played enough to call it the most rational ever.

The story as such isn't great so far, but neither did I think it was bad enough to put down.  I'm probably more influenced by the art, because I'm an artist (very infrequently).  That said, I do see a lot of potential for the magic system, a slight level of in-world munchkinry with it, and none of the characters being particularly stupid, so I think even without the art, I might have read more.

  Ar'kendrithyst ended book 4 last week on patreon, and I thought it was a very good ending. Better than any of the other books so far. We learned about almost all the relevant lore behind magic (and it is interesting) and we really got to see Erick reach his potential as a good person. Probably the first time in the novel where we see his goodness be celebrated instead of mocked/subverted by other people. Erick is also probably the most good protagonist I've ever read about. I'd highly recommend reading it if you were able to get past erick's character at the start.

  - u/SvalbardCaretaker:
    ```
    Erick is the most good progatonist you've read about? What about HPMOR, Worth the Candle, Unsong? Eternal paradise reality restructuring is a pretty common theme in rat!fic and I don't see Erick living up to that standard.
    ```

    - u/CaramilkThief:
      ```
      Most good emotionally I guess. The level of empathy and restraint necessary to do what he did in the end of book 4 is staggering. And besides, the endgame for the series seems to be heading towards something similar to eternal paradise restructuring.

      The world of Ar'Kendrythist is pretty fucked in terms of living conditions and general trend. Not as bad as Worth the Candle's nine thousand hells (don't remember the total number) but pretty close. Erick's one of the few people in power who has the social leverage necessary to *maybe* improve things, and is willing to do it.
      ```

    - u/ivory12:
      ```
      Those characters are paragons of utilitarianism. Erick represents a distinctly different flavour of moral good, one that is refreshing to read about. Especially so in contrast with a lot of the rat!fic standards like you mentioned.

      I'm not OP; I don't think Erick is the most good protagonist ever, but it's nice to read about a character whose principles are principal, if you catch my drift. In fact the worst parts of ArKendrithyst for me have been the segments where every other character piles on Erick for being dumb and naive and so on.

    By that are you looking for a weak monster MC that grows and evolves?

    If so, it’s a pretty sparse genre, and the only two good ones I know of are the Japanese light novel series So I’m a Spider, So What? and the English webnovel Chrysalis. Spider is my personal favorite monster MC novel, but every time I rec it here there are people who seem to dislike it, so there’s that. Of course, don’t expect rationality and character development and writing on par with works like Worm, but I do consider it the best monster MC novel. MC is quite competent and the litrpg elements are pretty good and not as awkward and clunky as Systems usually go. As a light novel series, you’ll also have to buy each volume of course, and they can be a bit pricey if you don’t sail the high seas. 

    Chrysalis has a bit of a strange litrpg system that I’m frankly not a fan of and the MC can be really stupid at times, but it’s still quite decent, especially considering how terrible most of these types of novels tend to go.

    You may also consider Everybody Loves Large Chests. It’s actually quite decent, but the disgusting, violent, and explicit sex and the garbage endings are major negatives.

    There’s a pretty new novel on RoyalRoad about a newborn demon called Salvos, inspired by the other big litrpgs on RR like Wandering Inn and novels like Spider. It’s still really early on but I find it decent, for what it’s worth.

      ```

      - u/Revlar:
        ```
        I usually de-rec it when I see it, because of the weird narrative changes in later volumes (entirely different narration/focus) and the way the novels handle that transition. 

        It also has that "Monster MC isekai'd so far away from people that it's just a record of grinding" thing going on, that it may even have invented but I still think is worth knowing before picking it up.
        ```

        - u/Dragfie:
          ```
          What do you mean weird narrative changes? I read it a while ago but didn't feel weird to me. 

          For the second point, I would actually make sure to mention that that CHANGES later in the story; at the time I hadn't read much so I got through the grind, but that's something that I may have dropped it for now if I hadn't known that it changes later. 

          But also; what Monster MC stories (especially Isekaied monster MC stories with a decent amount of chapters) do you think are *better* than spider?
          ```

          - u/Revlar:
            ```
            I think they're all too similar to spider and most of the ones I've read were unfinished, so I wouldn't be ready to recommend them, since they may go for a similar 'twist'. I didn't mean to imply I know a ton about the genre in general, just that I've seen Spider spawn a lot of these grindy and entirely stream of thought oriented monster litrpgs.

            Spider is a unique case, because the reason I wouldn't recommend it personally is that the grinding is a slog, but when it suddenly abandons the grinding it also loses the appeal that it used to have for people that could enjoy that. It ends with me wondering who the story should really be recommended to, at least in the state it was when I read a translation.

  I saw *Wonder Woman 1984* this weekend, on HBO Max.

  I liked it, although the general response on /r/movies was negative. The opening was cheesy, though in a good way (comparable to the Reeves Superman movies), and the middle had a few bumps (like why (Medium spoiler) >!a plane stored at the Smithsonian would be well-kept enough to have fuel at all, much less enough to cross the Atlantic twice, if such a thing was possible with relevant-era planes!< or (major ending spoiler) >!How everyone on Earth agreed to recant their wishes, unless the Lasso of Truth over super-TV is just that good.!<)

  The villains plan was actually quite clever, and the main reason why I'd suggest it here at all: He uses the >!one-time ironic-wish Dreamstone to ask to become it and gain its powers. He then uses his new-found wish granting powers to give people what they want, then either declaring the consequence in a manner benefiting him, or just tricking them into wishing for what he wants anyways, and countering the ironic twist of him rapidly losing health by taking people's good health in exchange.!< 

  Pedro Pascal steals the show as Max Lord, in a great performance. He really manages to sell his character as both clever and in over his head, as slimy and cool and sympathetic all at once. 
  Chris Pine and Gal Godot's chemistry was good enough to make the relevant romance scenes work. The new fish-out-of-water elements are charming, and the romp about the 1980s never dives too deeply into nostalgia for its own sake.

  Overall, I'd say good, better than its peers in the DCCU, if a slight bit worse than Shazam or Wonder Woman. You'll likely like it if you like the median Marvel movie, or want to a clever Munchkin of a plan.

    I disagree that Max Lord comes across as sympathetic, the character is >!unapologetically, cartoonishly evil. The only person Max Lord has empathy for is his son. When the rival oil baron wishes for an ethnostate and Lord takes his security in exchange, Lord is enthused to have gotten one over him. No thought is given to the consequences of what he has enabled, no attempt to cause another wish to undo the damage. He happily causes untold suffering, seemingly perfectly fine with destroying the world as long as he is on top. The only thing that causes him to stop is that his son is in danger, and one can assume he will start the whole cycle over after ensuring his son's safety. I was sorry Wonder Woman didn't execute him.!<

      I agree that the villain was a bit clever and very evil, willing to destroy the world for a bit of power. Seems about right for a DC villain.

      I don’t really understand the ending or the moral (truth conquers all? Don’t follow the dreams and acknowledge the truth that you’re a loser? Nuclear weapons are bad and giant walls tend to cause issues? Be careful what you wish for?).

      Also, they completely glossed over the immorality of having your boyfriend randomly possessing some dude and taking his stuff.

        ```

    - u/fljared:
      ```
      I'd argue against "Cartoonishly Evil", in that he mirrors real-world figures like >!Bernie Madoff and John Rockefeller!<

      As for Sympathetic, I agree he's evil and that that overrides what mellowing parts he has, but I refer more to >!the way he looks when he realizes he's about to become a huge public failure, and his backstory later showing he was a poor immigrant kid who really did start off with a small business and a dream.!<.
      His sympathetic parts are closer to, e.g., >!Vulture from Spiderman Homecoming. He has a sympathetic motive (if less so than "The Big man screwed me over", but you understand he's still an unrepentant murder.!<

      Perhaps it's a difference of usage here. I don't mean, for instance, that a character is one I approve of, or want to succeed, or need to think of as at least having their heart in the right place, just one with sympathetic parts.
      An unsympathetic villain, at least how I use the term, is closer to Beria from *The Death of Stalin*, who is an unrepentant rapist and murderer without even the lip service to the "Good of the Soviet State" that the other characters have.
      ```

      - u/Oerint:
        ```
        About the "Cartoonishly Evil" bit, I would consider those two and modern day equivalents to fit the description. As in, the actions of massive corporations / the ultra rich are something you would see on a Saturday morning cartoon, evil with no possible justification. Things like funding research to discredit climate change or raising the price of essential medicines to absurd levels. 

        I agree that Max Lord has moments that seem sympathetic in the film, but these seem intentionally undermined: >!He is shown starting a business, classic American dream, but his business is an oil drilling company - pretty much *the* symbol of greed and environmental destruction.!<
