  I noticed there are seven people at the Comet King's [seder table](http://unsongbook.com/chapter-17-that-the-children-of-jerusalem-may-be-saved-from-slavery/), and seven sails on *All Your Heart*.

  * red: normal wind, Uncle Vihann
  * orange: placebomancy, ??
  * yellow: Names, Sohu
  * green: singing, ??
  * blue: priest, Father Ellis
  * violet: angel, ??
  * black: ??, Comet King

  The other three people seem to be the Comet King's children, one of whom is Nathanda. TCK could have sent two of them to learn about placebomancy and singing, like he sent Sohu to learn kabbalah from Uriel. This doesn't explain where he gets an angel.

  Remember that woman being tortured mysteriously in the Hell chapter? Isn't torturing TCK's mother for following the wrong god or something *exactly* what Thamiel would do?

    You mean the Blue Lady? Scott's "hell consultant" actually posted what he had in mind when he added her, so I don't think she's a specific individual Scott wanted shown.

  Why is this story always posted without the title? How hard is it to put "Unsong" in front of "chapter"?

    It's bloody annoying because if you search on Reddit for unsong only half the posts come up.

    Seriously, it's not hard to be consistent.

    Look how inconsistent it is!

    Probably because it has a distinctive icon.

      Yeah, but that's not enough. Not everyone knows it's Unsong.

        The URL to the side indicates it's name.

        Although yes, that would be less useful for someone who wasn't aware of it.

  Okay, so The Comet King is Indian. Captain Nemo in 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea is Indian. This is not a coincidence because nothing is ever a coincidence.

  Typo thread:

  >He sounded totally humiliated, which under the circumstances Father Ellis supposed was reasonable.”

  extra quote at end.

  So, did Jala take on the mantle of the second Comet King? Or is being the Comet (Comet West) and being the Comet King (Jala West) entirely separate?
  Also, presumable this is the same Jala from the Leonard Cohen song on the first cover and the one whose mother was the maiden on the hill.

    First Comet King. If he wasn't the first, people wouldn't have been surprised at someone calling themself the Comet King.

    Also, him being a successor would not be compatible with a) he shocked Father Ellis by speaking a Name of God and having it do something and b) the Comet King is known to use Names frequently. Also: timeline.
