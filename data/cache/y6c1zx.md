## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  [Only Villains Do That](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/40182/only-villains-do-that) just keeps getting better. I disliked some flaws of the main character at first but at least some are there for character development and not just because the author likes being edgy. 
  It is an isekai novel with a little bit of parody of isekai. It isn’t particularly rational but is a fun read.

    >I disliked some flaws of the main character at first but at least some are there for character development and not just because the author likes being edgy.

    I'm optimistic that *all* of his flaws are there for character development. So far he's grown out of every major flaw that irked me. He's even growing out of his terrible people skills and misanthropic worldview, and he's on the road to adopting a more viable sociopolitical plan for his growing faction.

    It's my favorite ongoing story on RR and one of the favorite stories of all time. If you like or at least can bear the glacial pace (which it uses to develop its dozens of characters and create unique worldbuilding), it's a must read.

      I read The Gods are Bastards recently after discovering OVDT. This writer definitely shines when it comes to character development. He's able to maintain a rather large cast of character with realistic flaws without making them static. They all grow and react very believably to the story. Really a great read too if you like OVDT and haven't read it yet.

  I was reading the recently revived [Ship Core](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/41463/shipcore) and it reminded me of how fun those Factorio-esqu fics where the MC just builds a bunch of stuff for survival using their automated industrial capacity. The other stories that immediately came to mind were _Post Human_, _Factory Isolation_, and bits and pieces of lots of other stories (like the Bobiverse novels). Anyone have any other recommendations along those lines?

    [The Last Angel](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-last-angel.244209/#post-9354450) is the only vaguely related work that I can think of right now. A sentient warship strikes back at the oppressive galactic empire that nearly exterminates humanity.

    It is mostly a revenge story, but there's a lot of discussion of creating an industrial base.  Not at the level of detail that *Post Human* gets into though.

  Now that it's complete, I'm going to plug my My Hero Academia fanfic [The Meta Liberation Army Makes some Good Points](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-meta-liberation-army-makes-some-good-points-my-hero-academia-si-oc.932949/).

  If you'd prefer to get the delayed-release serial experience, I'm going chapter-by-chapter for a final round of edits and crossposting it on [AO3](https://archiveofourown.org/works/42295167). (I'm targeting a roughly 2xweekly release cadence, since I no longer have to *write* anything.)

  Fair warning, the ending is (intentionally) controversial. I might re-write the epilogue again for the AO3 version to A/B test, but the final chapter's events are set in stone.
  ```

  - u/meterion:
    ```
    Definitely feel like i'm just gonna be an echo of the feedback you've already succeeded, but everything about this fic was cool save the epilogue lol. It feels like a contrived sequel hook of a surprise "Gotcha! This story was a >!jumpchain!< all along!"

    It's just... so far out there, without doing anything to add to the themes or feelings of the rest of the story, it just made me more confused than anything. The "variant" epilogue was better but I can't help but feel that any the unique framing devices you could use to make a "highlights reel" of the future subtract more than they add, compared to a straightforward documentary or plain thirs person omniscient point of view.

    Still, it was a gripping plot and a daring way to conclude, so props!
    ```

  - u/TREB0R:
    ```
    Just read through it. I thought the final chapter was fine, the epilogue, not so much. Epilogue was a sharp departure from the rest of the story and just didn't fit the story.
    ```

  - u/IICVX:
    ```
    I agree with the sibling poster that the epilogue felt out of place, but honestly that was just because of the weird framing story around it. I'd suggest making the whole >!spying on everyone and seeing what happens next!< thing just a natural process, which the POV character has prior experience with.

  Request: Do we have any good, rational-esque historical self-inserts and alternate histories mainly explained through in-universe history sources like history books? 

  So I finished [An Extremely Reluctant Fuhrer](https://www.alternatehistory.com/forum/threads/an-extremely-reluctant-fuhrer-story-only-thread.388640/) (a modern person with foreknowledge replaces Hitler and tries to fix the mess he made after violating the deal at Munich). It was fine but the epilogue - which used only in-universe sources like TV panels and history books - elevated it to a whole new level. 

  Too often these stories feel like written down Paradox games. Watching smart people try to wrestle with the absurd volte face that happens and come up with rational explanations for it really adds a bit of flavor and puts things in context (and is greatly amusing). 

  Has anyone run into other stories like that?

    A Caged Bird in the Land of Eagles (King Zog SI) on [AlternativeHistory.com](https://AlternativeHistory.com), you need a account to read it, switches between a first person perspective and a variety of books and articles focused on him and world war 2 that shows the changes he has made to the timeline. He becomes king of the poorest and weakest country in Europe about a decade before world war 2 breaks out. The books are interesting in that it is obvious the authors have specific agendas. Some are dry history reading, one is a grad student writing a thesis on Albanian history, another really dislikes the SI as a military leader, and it also shows the damage/mistakes he made with his decisions. For example from his perspective he makes a ton of mistakes with his reforms and all but inevitable invasion from Italy showing that he is far from perfect. From the rest of the world's perspective he is this genius mastermind able to make a fortune in the great depression, uplift his country, and be a giant pain in the ass to the Axis.

      Thanks! That fic is usually on the recommendation lists but I've never cared enough about the region to jump in. Will definitely check it out now.

    ```
    I read through AERF, and there is something rather... disquieting about that story. Like, we can take as table stakes the idea that this rando can run a dictatorship without getting bumped off by someone else that knows what they're doing and would like to be Fuhrer themselves. And of course, it being AH, the pointless interjections about the "fixed" specs of specific tanks and battleships are what the audience is there for.

    >!But it's the author's underlying worldview that keeps creeping in that is unsettling. Like, you body-jack Hitler in 1939, so you try to stop the holocaust and WW2, right? But then the SI stops there. Let the jews out of the death camps, but take another 10 years to get around to stopping the propaganda against them because it's bad, sure, but it's just not as important. Offhand mention that they still euthanize "deficient" babies and you haven't gotten around to stopping it. Stop the propaganda about keeping women at home and pregnant... but mostly because it's not efficient for the workforce. There's quite a lot of "doing the morally correct thing without getting overthrown", but somehow it's always framed (both when selling it to the Nazis _and_ in his internal thoughts) as doing it because the consequences of not changing are bad or inefficient, not because it was wrong.!<

    >!And then there's the war with the USSR- which, sure, Stalin bad, they're saber-rattling, whatever. All good there. But the author can't help but poke through that the _real_ reason, for that and for selling arms to China, is to "defeat global communism". Wouldn't have been out of place in a 1980s book. Add in how the SI manages to bootstrap not one but like _eight_ different monarchies, diluted as they are, and you end up with a strange picture of their views of authoritarianism vs collectivism.!<

    >!Take all that, add the gratuitous sex with Eva Braun, and you end up with a story that's less "what would I do if I was dumped into Hitler too late to stop the rise of the Nazis with all the moral and political conflicts therein" and more "how cool would it be if Hitler had been smart instead of insane, you'd end up with a German Empire complete with a king and wealthy, influential Hitler women. And also better tanks." AH's favorite alt-history setup!!<

    I remember one AH fic about Victor Emmanuel III in the years before what would have been WWI written more as viewpoints from characters alive at the time
    that was on Alternate history forum but as far as I can tell it disappeared from the site now. Has anyone else read it who has the link?

    There are several fics there with him as a character, but in this one >! He tries to transition his country to a social democracy, ends up fighting France and trying to subtly grab all the oil producing colonies before other countries realize their value, only for it all to be traded away at the end by his negotiators for the Kongo !<

    There is also  [Make Egypt Great Again](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/make-egypt-great-again-waking-up-as-cleopatra-vii-philopator.394114/) Waking up as Cleopatra VII Philopator which isn’t written as historical articles but has more immersion than a lot of SIs. It involves some scheming to stay in power, light uplift, and lots of angst. It is incomplete but with a good recap of major plot points that would have happened.

  I've been reading To The Far Shore and would highly recommend it. As genre, I would categorize it as post, post, post apocalyptic science fiction-based fantasy. Writing quality is very high, the characters and world-building are both interesting and creative, and the author updates very regularly. 

  It's a fantasy, which doesn't often lend itself as much to pure rationality, but the writing and characters are certainly well-thought  through and consistent. Whether it's rationalist or simply well-written could be up for debate, but I recommend either way. There are some interesting takes on morality and long-term survival ethics in a future where periodic world-ending apocalypses are a historical certainty.

  [Dao of the deal](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/54762/dao-of-the-deal) is interesting take on xianxia genere. MC is thrown into a world where might makes right and is trying to come on top as a businessman. First arc of the story gave me strong Spice and Wolf vibes with him as a travelling merchant and I hoped it would stay that way. For now power system and social structure is somewhat resonable for a xianxia but we haven't seen upper reaches. I would say it is solid 7/10.

  Another story I cought up  with lately is [Hard enough](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/59240/hard-enough). It is  pokemon fanfic with Brock self-insert as a MC. I like that we start late into his life, after he went on his journey, cought his pokemon and become gym leader. But there is still tension left in the story to explore with his job, family life, events from original source etc. It just nice that there is little repeat material of POV of 10 years old child in the forest and instead we can see other facets of the world.

  &#x200B;

  Now I am looking for recommendations for fictions with:

  1) Business building. May be travelling merchant or stationary one or even stock trading. But rather not country/village building - those usually quickly focus on wars or politics. It's ok if it's only part of the story like Brock running pokemon gym. 

  2) Family guy stories like Hard enough or Beware of the chicken. Fluff and coziness, but with some other element to provide tension. 

  3) Other pokemon stories. I am already reading Origin of Species and Borne of Caution. I know there is a lot there, but some complete or expected to be complete stories would be nice. Or classics I am not aware of.

    > 1) Business building. May be travelling merchant or stationary one or even stock trading.

    Hard enough i binged this weekend, but dropped because the MC is too awesome. He's simultaneously one of the best trainers on the planet, physically a demi god, loved by all Pokemon, plays an excellent replacement dad to his nine younger siblings, coaches a little league team, scouted out by secret societies for his sheer talent, doing groundbreaking research into resurrecting ancient Pokemon that flummoxes the likes of oak, every women flirts with him, etc

  Instead of political figures, is there any historical SI into scientist/entrepreneur/artist? Newton, Marie Curie, Bill Gate etc...? What would happened if a modern nuclear physicist got SI into a dude working on the Manhattan Project? Same with the Space Race, Human Genome Project, AI, fusion research. More recent/near current time SI would be great, as well as from an Asian/Oceanic perspective, power of soft science/business practice is kinda neglected. If they would show *how those innovation work and their OTL impact* that would be **GREAT**.

  If y'all got any 'alien conspire to sneakily uplift human for their own gain' like 'A Fire Upon the Deep' hook me up please.

  [The Path of Ascension](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/40920/the-path-of-ascension) was recommended a few weeks ago, and I recently ripped through the entirety of it.  Overall a decent entry in the Cultivation / LitRPG genre with an uncommon SF setting.

  Minor criticisms follow.

  >!The timescales in the story seem rather unrealistic to me, though part of that may be the setting.  Sure, immortality is common enough, though not easy to achieve, so that may affect everyone's perspective.  As of the end of the current book (just a couple weeks ago) the MCs have been in a relationship for the last nearly 20 years.  They started "dating" (even after adventuring together for several years), and their relationship has remained largely static since then.  In their world, and among their peers, sure, 20 years is not a long time. But it is rather jarring for a baseline human in our reality to not think of that as a very long time. And to expect the relationship to evolve over that span of time.!<

  >!The overall sense of urgency is a bit strange, with regard to their training. On the one hand, being on "The Path" means going up in tiers according to schedule that can't be exceeded. But the MCs have been more than capable of ascending faster, and were deliberately paused at several points. It was sort of justified in-story, but that didn't seem quite enough for me. I understand the desire to build up good fundamentals before going to higher tiers, but still. They entered that tier 10 tournament at the beginning of tier 10, but could have tiered up sooner at gone in at mid or peak tier 10 instead.  They had already been handicapping themselves with their false identities (and associated alternate fighting styles that don't completely utilize their strengths).  The only real justification was with Liz and her parents promising not to interfere much before tier 10, but then they turned out to be not *that* overbearing. This is all balanced against the constant pressure on Matt to get to high enough a tier not to be subjected to undue pressure from whatever higher tier that might want to take advantage of him. So it seems like it would be best for him to get to tier 48 (or up to 50) as soon as possible. I don't know. !<

  >!I also found it weird that all the Artificial Intelligence implants are just... completely trusted? You can swear an oath that is AI-backed, and that's basically good enough for everyone, even nominal enemies? Like the AIs can't be spoofed or subverted?!<
  ```

  - u/Nick_named_Nick:
    ```
    >!I think the worldbuilding is pretty weak for this sub, mostly because Matt shouldn’t be on the Path for all of the reasons you’ve listed. The best parts of the story are when he makes rifts, or funds things with his mana. !<


    >!If he made the connection that staying on the path actually offers **more** freedom than being “free” (but under the complete control of tier 48’s+) earlier or at all, I’d be fine with staying on the Path. !<


    >!As it is I dropped the story when they have the mana concentration pow-wow and it basically becomes clear he only wants to stay on for his GF, who wants to prove she isn’t a spoiled mage…. Despite having a mana battery boyfriend and tier 30+ chaperones at all times. It just got to be too much to hand wave away. !<



    >!Aside from riftmaking the one other thing the story does really well is Aster. When he’s called out by that person in the (second…?) fake war they’re in, that he has what is essentially a child who’s only ever fought rifts and other people, and never PLAYED? WITH OTHER KIDS?!? !<

    ```
    I'm subscribed on Patreon so idk how much of this is spoilers and how much is just "it made sense to me", but: >!pretty much everyone expects a major war to break out between the Great Powers in the next millennium or so. The reason why Matt and Liz have essentially been focused on "punching up" is because all out war between the powers still observes some degree of decency, with the high tiers not immediately squishing entire armies of low tiers. So the point of the Path of Ascension isn't to power level people - it's to generate people who are _highly efficient at their level_. That's why Matt and Liz ran the tournament the way they did - to train their efficiency, and get some benefits from it, including that very public mediocre result for their public personas. Luna actually recommended that Matt leave the Path because, basically, him getting power levelled would be ideal for the Empire and for his build. However, Matt wants to remain on the Path because I think he understands that he _needs_ to be highly efficient for his tier in order to survive.!<

      >!I did pick up the political reasons for The Path, and the strategic reason for creating generations of lower tiers for the war-with-rules that is on the horizon. But if Matt power-levels to 48, 49 or 50, then who's going to mess with him? Even the Emperor with broken-as-they-get talent will have a hard time *forcing* Matt to do anything if he reaches that level. Assuming Matt doesn't become the worst tier-50 in history.!<

      >!If they hide Matt away on a high-enough tier planet, and he starts producing tier-50 rifts, the Empire will be able to produce as many high-tier individuals as they want. The other powers can threaten a war-with-rules, but if they only have a handful of tier 48+ people, and the Empire has triple that number or more, the Empire can just say: "If you attack us, we will have a war-without-rules, and *you will lose everything*". Of course, just Matt existing and creating tier-50 rifts, that may be considered an existential threat by the other powers, and they should attack immediately.!<

That's also why he rejected Luna's advice to drop off the Path and eat all the mana concentration potions the Emprah can provide.!<

        Like yes the optimal solution is for Matt to not do anything but charge mana crystals all day, but he absolutely hates that idea. It's about as irrational as Superman not personally providing electricity that's too cheap to measure to the DCU.

Matt can even optimize for ease of clearing the rift for the essence gained, but obviously he should still run all kinds of random rifts to keep his skills up.!<

          >!Matt really just needs to be on a planet with the appropriate tier.  And to be left alone. Though with entering Minkalla at barely level 11, it looks like he'll have all the challenge he needs for the next few years anyway.!<

          >!The mana concentration remains an issue if he wants to stay on The Path.  Though, if he spends a few years with more rift experimentation, he may be able to figure out how to create a rift with the right ingredients for having Liz make all the mana concentration he needs.!<

  [STEM](https://archiveofourown.org/works/38743008/chapters/96870558), a RWBY/Upgrade fic was reached the end of arc 1.
  A RWBY reimagination in a more rational world crossed with what looks like if we only read the Crystal Society from the human's point of view. 
  Highly recommended just from the RWBY part and interest in complex human emotions and responses, I found myself often trying to articulate or explain why would the characters act as they do (in a good way). 

  On the bad side, I find one character in particular a very big stereotype, and it uploads relatively slowly. The first arc could be considered the prologue of the whole book.

  Going to recommend [Bioshifter](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/59450/bioshifter) here. It's by the same author as Vigor Mortis, which has popped up in these recommendation threads from time to time, and [I gave a more detailed summary a month ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/x6gwtb/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/infva81/) in the second half of this comment, back when the public release was right around the corner. Essentially, the protagonist gets isekai'd as a bizarre 4-dimensional hyper-spider-thing on a dying world tree, except then she wakes up again, and now has to juggle two separate lives as both her bodies grow and change towards what seems to be a single common form. It's not exactly rational, in that Hannah is aware of her own flaws, issues, hang-ups, and trauma, but she is really, really terrible at dealing with the obvious issues in front of her. Still has amazing world-building and relatable characters, but maybe not the types of characters people here are looking for. Anyway, a dozen chapters have been posted in less than two weeks, and while the Patreon backlog is up to 30 chapters now, I think I recall the author saying they were going to try and keep the Patreon ~10 chapters ahead of the public releases, so expect the Royalroad version to get to about chapter 20 within the next fortnight.

  Also going to mention [Switchblade](https://archiveofourown.org/works/27750934/chapters/67927960) again, which I did a while back in a dump of My Hero Academia fics ages ago, given that it only has the final epilogue chapter left to be posted. To briefly summarize, right around the start of regular canon Midoriya Izuku turns up to class only to be informed that he went missing a week ago, and no one (including himself) knows what happened during that time. He ends up finding himself in possession of a bunch of new skills and reflexes he didn't have before, more fitting for an experienced ~~hero~~ ~~soldier~~ hero to have than a teenager, as well as a major mystery sitting on his own shoulders.

  While Izuku does manage to leverage the new skills he has to make it into UA, even quirkless, the story quickly departs the rails of canon due to taking several unexplored aspects of canon, or aspects that are just plain missing based on the rest of the setting, and building something new with the space. The second half of the story is particularly different, as the author discards the continual escalating of quirks in canon (which I am going to say is fucking terrible and the canon BNHA manga is a right droprick at this point) instead going for >!Japan descending into a complete civil war between the Paranormal Liberation Front and the rest of the country, with few punches pulled on the severity and scale of the conflict, with multiple important characters dying, several times directly "on screen" in fact.!<

  While the inherent nature of My Hero Academia's setting means it's not particularly inclined to being rational, and this fic isn't exactly what people may be looking for, it still has an unpowered protagonist in a superhero setting relying on his intelligence and skill to survive, has a central mystery as Midoriya tries to unravel what exactly happened during his missing week, and is just about complete at about ~330k words, which are all strong points in its favour.

    I've read all of what's available of Bioshifter too, and like the rest of Thundamoo's works, I really love how the author just embraces the madness and come up with stuff that's just so damn *interesting*. 

    My only complaint would be that, like RavensDagger actually (huh), Thundamoo tends to write young, often naive, female protagonists who end up unwillingly undergoing body transformation to get very magically powerful and invariably end up being "useless lesbians". The fact that I can so specifically pin down this sub-sub-genre is... a bit eh. Props for finding a niche I guess. 

    Like, I get that highschoolers are supposed to be walking bags of hormones, and maybe my personal experience of a rather relaxed high school experience makes it difficult to empathize, but I just wish there were less crushes, pining for others, relationship drama, etc. Reading about how teenagers struggle at dating just isn't interesting to me when there's a literal magic world etc out there

      The gender ratio is grating at my suspension of disbelief in *Vigor Mortis*. At this point, there is like one half-relevant male character left.

      It would have been funny, had Lark turned out to be vrothizo-biologically male. (Why do vrothizo even have (single) sexes? Seems inefficient.)

      *Bioshifter* seems to follow this pattern, except it doubles down and makes everyone a lesbian on top of that.

      *Bioshifter* could have >!Brendan just pretending to be transgender, leveraging the overabundance of lesbians to try to get a girlfriend!<, but I very much doubt that it will go that way. The setup is not quite right, for one thing.

      The other (nitpicky) complaint I have for both works is that they both take place on ridiculously vertical worlds, but the fact that air pressure depends on altitude is seemingly totally ignored. In *Vigor Mortis* in particular, this shouldn't be hard to address - biological engineering, teleportation platforms within pressure chambers, or extra spells to handle pressure differences - it just never is.

      Of course, I still very much recommend both works. They are great fun to read.

      The misleading chapter titles of *Bioshifter* are particularly amusing.

        >!Honestly, this was my first thought too, since the story makes it clear that Brendan has had a *big* crush on the protagonist.  While it's not very smart long term, I could totally see a teen deciding to be trans just so they could be with their crush.!<

        >!That said, I also think it's unlikely, because while the author likes big twists and escalation, a "pretending to be trans" plot element wouldn't fit with their style as I don't think it fits to the story they want to tell and their politics.!<

        >!As the story is going, Brendan will probably be asked to be turned into a monster girl via magic.!<

        On the air pressure point, I have to say that, with a sufficiently out-there fantasy world, a lot of the stuff we take for granted like the dependence of air pressure on altitude wouldn't necessarily exist. For example, with the existence of floating islands, not to mention magic and massive monsters, I'm sure the wind dynamics are very different. Could well be significantly better mixed and vertically more homogeneous, and/or maybe massive flying islands create eddies. Air pressure on vertical worlds could be very different to Earth.

          I mean yes, I am sure you can hand-wave it away with more of "because the Mistwatcher maintains it that way", but it's an extra duty with a seemingly small benefit to it. It can shuffle its farm around more easily that way, but the same could be achieved by just keeping all the floating islands at the same altitude - it has enough space for that.

          Usually *Vigor Mortis* is pretty good at keeping its "real (material) world invaded by an all-consuming lazy magical god" ontology believable. This seems like an unnecessary deviation from it.

          Also, if the air pressure is artificially maintained around the islands, the lack of that in the inter-island air should be an addition hazard to flying between them, yet it is never mentioned. It's just "you get swatted, if the mists are not up".

          But as I said, it's a nitpick.

            Ah, I wasn't saying the Mistwatcher does it, I'm saying it could be the natural flow regime of a sufficiently mixed atmosphere even before we consider magic. I do think the author just ignored it, but in a lot of these stories I'll see people complain that 'thing that happens in real life' isn't present because they've assumed it a fact of life when in fact the conditions of the fantasy world mean it wouldn't actually happen.

              In a fluid, the pressure at a point at depth *d* is simply the integral of the weight of the fluid above that point + pressure waves, i.e. sound.

              You can have a giant standing pressure wave around a planet. But a standing wave moves up and down at non-nodes, so if the amplitude is at all significant, it's not gonna be pretty for whatever lives there.

              Now, you say that the atmosphere could be better mixed, but that's actually the exact opposite of what we want - we want separate air masses of different densities. Assume the Mistwatcher is farting a massive amount of helium at a particular area. The helium will be accelerated by buoyancy upwards until it reaches the stratosphere and spreads there. But now we have a line of helium instead of a line of regular air above *d* and the height of the atmosphere didn't change - so the pressure at that altitude within the helium column will be lower than the pressure outside it.

              For this to work best, the ridiculous column of helium should not have the chance to mix with the surrounding atmosphere before reaching the stratosphere. So the Watcher better fart fucktons of it.

              EDIT: ...probably. Because I am totally ignoring the fact that the column of helium has a velocity and that it's a highly dynamic system.

              So yeah, that sounds even worse than "the Mistwatcher just does it with magic".

              (BTW, I am assuming that the floating islands are just magic or levitating superconductors or whatever - something that does not rely on the atmosphere, because it makes little sense otherwise.)

                That is a very simplified analysis. There are many more ways to effect pressure than just standing waves, especially in mixed/ turbulent system, such as eddy formation or fluid viscosity. My point is that the fluid might be a complex turbulent system where many of these effects could be significant enough that a simplified analysis becomes inaccurate. To be honest I don't know much about meteorology, I'm just coming at this from my understanding of fluid dynamics.

                Also, the helium emissions would more likely form a bubble column rather than a column with laminar flow (actually, what flow regime would form is a whole science unto itself), though actually some sort of miniature helium atmospheric bubble in the middle of a bubble column might be possible assuming a very stagnant atmosphere.

                Point is, physics is complex and the analysis of a fictional world's plausibility is more often built on assumptions that the fictional world is similar to Earth than thorough analysis (which is practically impossible when details aren't specifically addressed by the author). Just consider how many things exist in the real world, that occur naturally or that people have built, that a shallow analysis would deem impossible. Keeping this in mind helps me give many stories the benefit of the doubt, which helps me enjoy them more.

      For both of Thundamoo's previous works I hit a point where it lost me and I stopped keeping track of updates; I didn't immediately drop it at that point, and kept reading what I had downloaded, I just never felt interested enough in the story to check for updates. For HMGGH it was her offering herself up as a slave for killing a creature in self-defense that she later learned was sapient. For VM it was her stopping *in the middle of an enormous battle* to bicker with someone, declaring that her opponent is trans; when they responded with something like "What the fuck, you don't get to decide that?" she just argued with them about how they definitely are trans, and she doesn't care what they think about the fact. It felt like strawman of progressivism conjured by /pol/, some forced transitions nonsense. The fact that she continued bickering until she was literally murdered just intensified my negative impression of the whole scene.

      I think that RavensDagger comparison is interesting, because I've previously found that RavensDagger has written many stories that sound interesting and start interesting, but I always end up bored or frustrated so I drop it. Guess I'll add Thumdamoo to that same list of "competent author, but not for me."

  Recommendations for stories about superpowers, where superpowers are thoughtfully and consistently depicted, and there is some amount of focus on clever, creative use of the superpower?
  I don’t so much care about being try to  the laws of physics as long as they are consistent.

  Major bonus points if people use superpowers for more than committing/stopping crime.

  I’ve read Worm and Metropolitan Man.  Want more.

  Thanks.

      Note for anyone encountering this for the first time: While it has been "revived" after a long hiatus before (briefly), this story is almost certainly abandoned. It's still fantastic, and, in my opinion, worth reading (probably the only abandoned fic I would say that about), but if that's a deal breaker for you, you should be aware.

  Are there any stories with similar feel and similar kind of premise to Subnautica? That is an individual or a small group with access to high technology(or possibly magic) is stranded in a hostile and unfamiliar environment. With focus being on exploration and settling in. Survival concerns exist but are in the background.

    The fanfic [Inspired Voyage](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/inspired-voyage-st-voyager-si.791005/) might fit your request. The basic premise is that a Star Trek fan gets isekaid into a character aboard the USS *Voyager* shortly after it is stranded in a hostile quadrant of the galaxy 70,000 light years from home (the beginning of the *Star Trek: Voyager* TV series). He gets promoted to head of security, i.e. the infamous "red shirts" that typically die in away team missions for increased dramatic tension in the TV show.

    He must plan ahead for numerous issues, including: dwindling onboard resources, plummeting crew morale due to everyone knowing they probably won't live long enough to reach home, lacking intel on nearby alien civilizations, and a peacetime fleet doctrine which runs totally counter to the militaristic developments needed to keep the crew safe in hostile territory.

    Along the way, he has to deal with a captain who is still focused on scientific exploration rather than survival. Thus, the crew ends up exploring many dangerous and exotic places that featured in the original show.

        >the main character has a technology tree from the Mass Effect video games

        To be clear, his technology tree ability isn't from *Mass Effect*. It's an "Inspired Inventor" perk that periodically gives him 'charges' he can spend to gain in-depth knowledge about any technology he chooses - fictional or otherwise. He spends some charges on *Mass Effect* technology, some on Stark Tech (Marvel universe), some on canon Star Trek technology, and some on general concepts like "efficiency". Some knowledge of fictional technology turns out to be useless because it is impossible to reproduce in the Star Trek universe. Knowledge of these fictional universes isn't needed to enjoy the story.

        Throughout most of the story, this (potentially overpowered) ability is balanced by the extreme difficulty of the situations the MC must prepare for. His efforts are complicated by the fact that military tech is extremely frowned upon and restricted by Star Trek's normal, 'peaceful' operating procedures.
