## Looking for books with highly-empathetic characters guided by an inner sense of morality / a conscience or affected by guilt, because I don't have those things

### Post:

(This post is long and in retrospect could've been made a lot shorter.)

The rationale behind this request is kind of weird. I've recently noticed I'm very likely to have undiagnosed antisocial personality disorder. The now-outdated term for it is sociopathy. Or, I'm far along enough on that spectrum that it's a helpful nomological framework for me and the patterns are visible. 

The problem is, I'm a writer. When I go back through old bits of fiction I wrote, especially fanfiction, I notice my characters never have moral dilemmas. I either wrote them explicitly as amoral or tried to have them moral but skipped over their morality like it was an annoying thing getting in the way. Usually they were focused on how to justify their actions to other people, not to themselves. If you'd like to see examples of this, I wrote the HPMOR spinoff [The Universe Is An Optimisation Problem](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12299677/6/The-Universe-Is-An-Optimisation-Problem) and I'm in the middle of a huge conceptual and structural rewrite at the moment since people liked it a lot despite its flaws. The biggest one? Every single character who I wrote in perspective for any substantial amount of time - Harry, Ozland, Evelyn, Hermione, and anyone whose character I thought about in any detail - is a glib, charming, smart but ethically-empty sociopath. 

Ozland is a messianic religious cult-leader who fell into the role and has very little in the way of any goals or interests aside from directionlessly amusing himself and maintaining power. An atheist or an agnostic in private, what he says has absolutely no bearing on his personal convictions, of which he has close to none. His response to being accused of murder wasn't outrage, but to flippantly re-accuse the accuser, making it up as he went along for no reason other than that he thought it would be funny.

> "I know," Ozland smiled thinly, "I'm not that persuasive when you put me on the spot, though. All of those things are things I've had to respond to over the years, so I suppose you could say it's a prepared spiel."

> "Do you believe it?" Penelope questioned.

> "I don't know. It's not really that important."

Evelyn is a religious zealot obsessed with media-management and public perception, who believes in God (or, the Unorthodox Church's god, at least) and responds to her enemies viciously and sadistically.

> The woman sitting to her right, the wife of the Chief Financial Officer of the Mongol Private Defense Corporation, slouched, fanning herself. "How long do these usually take?" she asked Evelyn in a loud drawl.

> "Depends," Evelyn replied, having already decided that she disliked the woman's attitude, which she had evaluated separately from her being a 77-Church-following God-damned heathen whore bitch gold-digger who would inevitably be vaporized by the Celestians when the End Times came.

She later terrifies and manipulates the woman into moving to the back row. When discussing the suicide of a major figure within the cult, her initial thought is to suppress the information and tell the public that he was assassinated by another cult via the ice cream brand of a company that competes with their sponsor - Tip Top. She also implies that they've conducted political assassinations and covered them up just to give non-Tip-Top ice cream brands a bad name.

> "Alright, what are you thinking, Ev?" he said, before realizing he should be more specific.

> "I was thinking 'poisoned with plutonium in his Magnum ice cream by fanatics affiliated with the 77 Church', but that's a little dull."

> "Magnum?" Ozland asked, still distracted.

> "Can't have Tip Top complaining again," Ev said lightly.

> He drummed his fingers on the table. "People call us the ice cream mafia for a reason, Ev – people notice this kind of shit after a while. That's three supposedly Magnum-related deaths in, what, three months? Hasn't Magnum already suffered enough? Why don't we just shell their factories instead of subjecting them to slow, humiliating bad publicity through falsified police reports?"

> "I know," she giggled, "it's so silly how people believe whatever we tell them. Alright, you have a point there. I'll say it was a ThauNestlé cappuccino or something. And then tonight shell their factories just for a change. Anyway, as I was saying – nobody really visits Rushabh except for me, you, Dom, and Kev - we can keep this from the newspapers for a week at the most, so I'll handle the media until we can fudge the records properly."

Hermione starts out as the person we know, but has her friend shot in front of her at the age of eleven and never properly recovers from the trauma. By the time we see her, she's completely empty of anything but desire for revenge, seeing others as patterns and objects to be manipulated. She repeatedly plays games with her psychologist and lies to her parents to throw off attention, while she plans and successfully executes what amounts to a terrorist attack.

> He ignored her and continued. "Your school counsellor is also worried." Usually he would try and empathise with his patients – making light conversation. Unfortunately, Hermione Granger invariably managed to divert the conversation far away from talk of her wellbeing or mental health, until the one-hour session expired and he went home, immensely frustrated. He hadn't even been aware of it the first few times. This time, Doctor Willigan noticed, she had offered him only a half-hearted diversion. There was something she wanted to say, and he'd be damned if he knew what it was.

> "Oh?"

> "She's somewhat disturbed at how well you've been . . . coping. Managing the trauma of losing someone close to you. She says you seem to be barely affected. She thinks you're channeling your . . . anguish into academic performance, however silly that may sound."

Moreover, when we meet her again in what turned out to be the final chapter, we see no traces of guilt or remorse, only a smooth effort to hide her responsibility. 

Harry, you either know, or you don't in which case I'll avoid spoiling it. The most consistent (and flattering) comment I got was "you captured HPMOR!Harry's voice really well, better than any other fanfanfic I've read". Well. Uh, there was probably a reason for that.

I have a few Worm fanfics in the wings, maybe 20-30 abandoned other pieces of fiction, and by any metric, every single character I have ever written is profoundly sociopathic. I'd like to say, y'know, rationality and all. But really? It came before I even discovered the subreddit. I didn't even notice the pattern. I wrote people without conscience, guilt, or empathy, damaged mirrors of myself, because it just didn't occur to me up until around two weeks ago that my habitual thought-patterns might actually be a pathology. To me, there were people who thought clearly and were worth respecting, people who didn't and weren't, and crazy morons who thought clearly but killed twelve people anyway for unguessable reasons. (Yeah, I know, the whole 'inflated ego, belief in superiority over others' is kind of typical for ASPD.) 

My best guess? It was diagnostically "masked" by Asperger's syndrome which has a lot of plausible and excusable overlaps, weirdly credulous parents and teachers, and, well, by itself. The other factors were that I grew up in a nice household with a warm family, I'm female, I'm non-violent, and by default a kind, helpful and polite person (or, that's the role I play? I don't exactly care about those things either way, but that's who I'm being right now), so the stereotypes didn't exactly apply. 

Now? I'm realising I'm missing a pretty vital human experience. I feel like I can't write well until I have a solid grip on what kind of thought processes go through other people's heads. I've been modelling everyone else as "me plus some kind of moral gut-sense getting in the way of them being effective that I need to work around to get them to do what I want", but that's not accurate. From my nearly-exegetical poring-over of HPMOR, that's the error Quirrelmort made - there's no way I'm going to shout at a fictional character for being stupid and then hypocritically refuse to apply that same insight to myself. I kind of want to know what it's actually like living in someone's else's head. And the only way I know how to do that? Getting absorbed in a good book so I can experience it second-hand.

I'd just like to clarify I'm looking for something very specific. I'm not exactly looking for characters with moral codes that they automatically stick to. I understand that, that seems straightforward. Neither am I looking for characters who are conflicted over their actions versus the dominant social/religious code and the likelihood of punishment or isolation. That I understand too. And I'm not looking for characters with prosocial, cooperative and altruistic goals who pursue them ruthlessly. I get that as well. I'm looking for the characters I found incredibly annoying, the ones that usually made me drop a book entirely. The kind of ones who deliberate for several pages on a decision because it rends their being in half. People who viscerally experience the feeling of, well, I'm not sure. Wrongness? In an intuitive way. Or rightness? In a way separate from, or indistinguishable from philosophy or ideological end-outcomes. Squeamishness? Conscience? Pre-guilt? And of course, people who deal with the aftermaths of their decisions and feel guilty about them. I think. 

I really don't know. That's part of the reason why this post is so long. This is an outside context problem for me. I'm at the "specific and minimal code I stick to and review each year, plus prosocial, cooperative and altruistic goals that involve power and status" stage. Right now, the code is "make, record the exact wording of, and keep promises extremely carefully, to a semi-neurotic Kantian level" and goals I found from doing 80,000 Hours' exercises. If I had to apply labels, I think mainly in utilitarian, self-centred, and consequentialist patterns. Or, judging by the number of times I got into trouble as a child and a teenager, whatever seems funniest to me at the time. 

I've read about game theory and philosophy and the sociology of morality, and I understand that we're usually better off if everyone avoids lying, cheating, manipulating, stealing or doing illegal things, but it just doesn't connect at all with my decisions or thoughts beyond justifying them to other people after the fact or covering them up. I defect, everyone else cooperates, I'm left better off. It's not exactly something I choose to do, it's just that "moral goodness" is a formula I have to manually apply at the end after the automatic stuff is over.

And since it's usually useless, I don't have time to interrogate every single thought or do things methodically, and nobody can see my thoughts anyway - only the end result - I forget it or skip it. Unless it's something like "A and B are pretty much exactly the same but B hurts 5 people in the abstract who I don't care about", in which case I go with A. Even when I do apply it, unless the scales are very closely balanced, it doesn't *change* anything for me - it's just information on how other people might perceive it. 

I'm not some kind of utilitarian goal-maximising calculator. I do stupid and impulsive shit all the time. If I had to introspect, it's just that I don't implicitly weight actions, possibilities, strategies, ideas, words, or thoughts by how moral they are? By default truth and fiction, harming or helping, giving or taking, cheating or cooperating, keeping promises or not, obedience or disrespect, fairness or bias, are neutrally calibrated options until I subconsciously or consciously apply various non-moral criteria in layers like "how fun would it be?" (very strong), "would this compromise or reinforce the image of myself I've cultivated in anyone who sees me do it?", "how much does this hurt people I dislike?", "does this advance my status or social standing?", "is a person who I value likely to be affected and if so in what way?". And the possibility-space for "immoral" actions is just ... much larger. 

"Fun" unfortunately for me involves debating for positions I don't believe in, exploiting systems, dominance-games, complex deception, manipulation of people I both like and know; "light" forms of sadism confined to verbal and emotional abuse of people I dislike and don't know. I know, it's ugly. But I don't want to glamorise myself and I figure this isn't really unusual for human beings, I just do it a lot more than the rest of us do. I also spend a lot of time being earnest and honest, teaching, educating, advising, listening to, and generally helping people. But looking back? I usually lose interest if there's no status game involved or if I've reached the top, and exit the game entirely if I'm forced into a subordinate position I don't like. That last part is what differentiates ASPD from psychopathy - sacrificing the long-term for the short-term. 

I fluidly move between both groups of strategies, prosocial or a/anti-social, without really differentiating between the two, because to me? Everything is kind of basically manipulation and deception. Deception, because by default? There's either no strong emotion or belief beneath and I'm operating glibly and automatically, or there's something beneath and there's no reason to broadcast my emotions clearly to you if they're not advantageous to the situation. Manipulation? Because putting a warble in your voice, looking downcast and shakily telling even the truth in a specific way, is manipulation. If you're not doing it, you're voluntarily playing the game with a handicap, just because the alternative makes your brain feel bad.

I guess this is just me explicitly articulating my implicit worldview. Damn, it reads like some insufferably boring mass shooter manifesto. I tried pretty hard to lean away from that writing-style but really? If I went in the light-hearted and humorous direction, I'm pretty sure it would sound even more deranged. Or maybe it struck a chord with you, sounded half-comprehensible. My insincere apologies in any case, either way. I hope this gives you an idea of what ASPD feels like from the inside for me, and I'm hoping you'll have an idea of what might help me understand, because I don't even know what concept I'm looking for. I want to improve my characterisation and writing, and try and do a relatively neurotypical character. Maybe some kind of evopsych textbook, even? A subsecond breakdown of what thoughts flash through your head when doing morally-related stuff? Dunno. Thanks for reading this long-ass, self-absorbed post anyway, I spent like five hours writing and editing it and it spun out of control.

(Side notes. I'm going to be candid: I have a secondary motivation here. I feel a little bit in danger given the number of people I've seen calling for ASPD people to be killed, lobotomised or permanently imprisoned, and how stigmatised it is even within the psychotherapy community. Justifiably? Maybe, not sure. I know some of them are fucking scary and I'm personally going to use my own insider knowledge to steer clear of them as much as possible. There's a strong "aliens living in human skin among us" vibe I still feel even right now, except now it's pointing inwardly. Hollywoo's representation isn't so amazing. But I'm equally as worried about that as damaging my relationships irreparably with my friends and family if I let slip that, oh, psychologically I have a shit-ton in common with Patrick Bateman - but it's okay, I don't want to dismember you, promise! Anything that either helps me understand what it's like being neurotypical well enough to simulate the process in my own head? That both makes me feel safer knowing I could bluff normalcy if my life or freedom were on the line - and means there's a hope I could make it automatic enough for the apparent difference between me and the rest of humanity to stop mattering over time. 

I should note that I have some kind of intuitive empathy, but it's kinda flaky, very emotionally basic, limited, and off by default until I turn it on. I'm kind of suspecting there's something funky with it but I don't know how to tell what it is. If I see someone smiling or crying, I find myself edging towards the same thing automatically. That bit's intact. It's mostly the higher-level stuff, like intuitively valuing other people's happiness instead of brainstorming lists of things I could do when their opinion of me is flagging. There's definitely (sub?)clinical narcissism and histrionic PD in the mix as well, unsurprisingly. This is another reason I was in denial about the rest for so long.

If you're looking for something that helps you understand the other side more, "Confessions of a Sociopath" by M. E. Thomas is apparently good for "empaths", despite the 1-star review-bombing it got on goodreads. It was the thing that catalysed my realisation because I found myself reading it and went "oh, haha I'd get along really well with her, she thinks pretty much just like me ...shit". I'm guessing this subreddit has a disproportionate number of us, so it's worth a read. Or a quick skim of the wikipedia summary of ASPD.)

edit: wow this got a lot of responses. I'm in the middle of getting around to them all

  I'd suggest considering a different take on this. A common Writing Advice you see everywhere is 'write what you know'. you actually got lucky in that regard: while missing out on something most people take for granted, you are experiencing a very rare human condition. 

  Writing about your own experience - all the ways you describe being ASPD in society are fascinating - might actually make for good plots (maybe mostly from that one POV). Your post was a great read. Why not try writing about the experience of being surrounded with cooperators & feeling the defector? Feeling like an Alien in Human Skin, or The One Sane Person? Many rationality fics play on these tropes.

  If you insist on writing neurotypical characters, rather then trying to 'Adopt' their thought process, I'd suggest asking neurotypical Beta readers and friends for their opinion and suggestions in a 'what would you have felt/done if...?' Kind of way. 
  Otherwise, your might just be Mirror Imaging, and still come off as not convincing.

  Ps, You mentioned you write Worm fanfics - did you read Ward?

    Even though I agree with you mostly, I think it's inevitable that a writer needs to portray characters with decisions modeled after conventional social ethics. So even if OP specializes in their particular niche, there is need for research to be able to bring forth a wider cast. 

    That being said, I can suggest to look into the romanticist period, especially the French romanticism deals a lot in honour and morality (Dumas, Balzac, Zévaco, etc).

  This was a very interesting post, and I enjoyed getting a glimpse into the way you view the world and how it's affected you and your writing. It didn't come across as a "mass shooter manifesto", at least not to me. 

  To start with, the first thing I'd recommend is that you talk to a therapist if you haven't already. Not because I think you're dangerous, but because they would be able to confirm your diagnosis, provide a lot of helpful information on how neurotypical people experience empathy, and give you some suggestions if you're worried about being targeted due to your condition. 

  As far as novels that might help you understand how to write empathetic characters, here are a few I was thinking of:

  \- Basically anything by Stephen King.  I personally find his writing to be slow and boring, but he does a very good job at describing a character's inner thoughts and motivations.

  \- The Stormlight Archives by Brandon Sanderson feature a variety of morally "right" characters that experience ethical dilemmas. The caveat for this one is that the series is unfinished and each book is *incredibly* long.

  \- Poison Study by Maria V. Snyder is a YA fantasy novel featuring non-sociopathic characters who nonetheless do a lot of scheming and manipulation. Might be good to check out depending on the target audience for your stories.

  \- Atonement by Ian Mcewan is a historical fiction novel about a character who does something terrible and has to live with the guilt.

  \- The Artemis Fowl novels might be useful because they feature a protagonist who is the villain of the story but is still relatable and 'good' enough to be a sympathetic character. The Dexter novels do the same thing. This might help with getting your audience to connect to your more sociopathic characters.

  \- Joe Abercrombie is a fantasy author who does some really interesting things with his characters. The ones that I tend to like in the beginning of the story become less likeable and more morally 'bad' as the story goes on, and vice versa. I feel like this might be a good example for how to make your audience feel a certain way about your characters, rather than just describing their own inner emotions/moral conflict.

    Second this, everyone should go to therapy anyway, a good therapist can be super helpful.  It can take several tries to find someone you click with that will get you and push you in the right ways though, so don't give up if it's not great on the first try!
    ```

  - u/Bowbreaker:
    ```
    How safe is therapy though? ASPD is pretty stigmatised and therapists are also only human. I know that in the US some like to push the "threat to others" excuse to its limits. And then there's laws like the one where they have to directly report anyone who is suffering from pedophilia. I don't know if other anti-social diagnoses are treated similarly.
    ```

    - u/JQShepard:
      ```
      I sincerely doubt it's the same case for APSD.  Technically speaking, no one should ever be reported simply for having a diagnosis. The reason  that pedophiles get reported (in theory) is because they've actually committed - or have said that their going to commit - child abuse. 

      But what exactly would you report a person with ASPD for?  Being mean? I do think you make a good point that therapists are human, and you shouldn't just settle on the first one that you find, but that doesn't mean that OP shouldn't try.

      (Also, [here's](https://www.vocativ.com/315929/pedophiles-seeking-help-put-therapists-in-ethical-catch-22/index.html) an interesting article I found online where a bunch of therapists complain about having to report their patient's for CP because it hinders their therapy - so I don't think the pedophile-reporting issue is as big a deal as we might assume).

  ```
  Do different forms of disutility really feel that different? I take it it you feel bad about the thought of losing of money or status. The thought of doing evil feels approximately the same, I'd say. It's just another term in the native utility function.

  What may be tricky for you to grok is that it is not a boundary condition, or a constraint. It is genuinely part of the utility function. The character would feel that a world where they haven't lied is better than one where they have, just like you might prefer a world where you have a submarine to one where you don't.

  Makes me wonder about  characters that have terms in their utility functions that no human has. Aliens in fiction at best have a very different weighing of terms, or miss some. Or have different ethics, but that is a conscious level utility function. I suppose a paperclip optimizer counts.
  ```

  - u/mercurytongue:
    ```
    Huh. That's such an interesting way of reframing it. I'll try and rephrase it so I can be sure I understood it - morality as not an external feature of the environment that needs to be factored in, or a step at the end of the decision-making process, but something deeply encoded into the character's preferences about the world? Okay, I'm now thinking writing moral characters isn't such an intractable problem after all. I figure out a strong ethical code for them, but I skip the actual thought-process in text, so it looks like it's implicit in their thoughts and actions. Alien encounter / cultural shock narratives like Three Worlds Collide always appealed to me because the issue was always one side assuming a universal and then omitting mentioning it explicitly, and the confusion resulting from that. The 'losing money or status' thing I'm going to ruminate on. That puts it in a context I understand, I think. Thank you!

  It's not something you can read, but The Good Place (the TV series) has its protagonists learning how to be and think morally. One of the main characters, Chidi, is a moral philosopher whose main issue is his immense squeamishness/conscience/(pre-)guilt, about which he deliberates a lot. Maybe you'd find it interesting to analyze his perspective.

  I have a friend who probably has anti-social who is intelligent and high functioning. I think you're approaching this the right way, which is to use metacognition and to engage your slow brain on these problems in ways that might compensate for your lack of instincts. I think people with personalities similar to yours tend to do well with interpersonal tactics but to lose the war due to failures of strategy. Normies are strong in developing deep relationships and communities over time that sustain them. This comes in the form of practical resources, but also a sense of meaning that improves cognition, energy, and emotional stability. I don't think anti-social or autistic spectrum gives a pass on these basic cognitive needs, which is touch if you're not built for interconnection

  Not an expert, but I feel a useful stand-in for you, and possibly for your fiction, would be to focus on principles and virtues. Principles are abstract, as opposed to ad hoc, ethical standards, such as protect the weak or share knowledge. If you pick one or two to focus on, you can use them as a lens to alter behavior, and you may find you're surprised with results, as I do feel that many, and especially the highest functioning individuals, can sense integrity in the form of a consistent application of principles. Even getting one such person on your side can be life changing. Virtues are individual qualities that can be cultivated, such as forbearance, resolution, tranquility, temperance, industry, frugality, or silence. These can also be conveved of abstractly but can lead to more efficacy and pro-social behavior over time. An interesting hack might be to write characters who each have two virtues, a vice, and a principle...I bet normies won't notice that they're not reading normies when you focus on these helpful abstractions.

  >As a fan The Universe Is An Optimisation Problem, I just wish to say you have nothing to be concerned about.  Your writing style is fresh, different, and most importantly unique.  HPMOR didn't become popular by following the path of every other piece of writing.  It did something different.  And in the process developed people who both loved it and hated it.  That is what you should try to do.  Go after a niche and attack it hard.  Don't write a book for everyone.  Write a book for a few people, and do it well.   So take your world style and thought process and crank it to a 100.  The world doesn't care if you can do a million things okay.  It only cares if you can do a few things really well.  So I would recommend not wasting your time on something that isn't in your skill set.  Don't try to write emotional (insert word here) characters and do a meh job.  Instead write what you know best, and knock it out of the park.  As someone who notices that you've rewritten UIAOP at least 5 times, and it being 2 years since you've updated, I feel as if you need to be told the opposite advice of most.  Don't edit every little thing, don't sweat the details as much.  You already are highly talented.  Most of your readers wouldn't even notice the small things.  Most would prefer you to simply continue updating and writing, then another edit through.  Just by having legible english, you stand head and shoulders above most fanfics.  Don't sweat the small stuff.

    Oh wow, this makes me feel really warm and glowy, thank you. I kind of agree, my future direction for writing is just going to be minimal planning and editing, maximum output. I've more or less come to the same conclusion with the niche/specialisation idea. But the issue with UIAOP is more of a big-picture structural one. Too ambitious, too many moving parts, evolved from something that didn't look anything like it without shedding its vestigial organs. If I wrote a linear continuation, I'd just be constrained by the existing flaws. The reboot (The Universe Could Be More Sensibly Organised) will be pretty different, but it'll be the same two fundamentals concepts (deconstructing and reconstructing HPMOR's setting, and picking up the various plot threads HPMOR didn't explore properly), with the same atmosphere of huge historical differences and looming apocalypse. So I'm fairly confident if you liked UIAOP you won't be too disappointed.

  I have an aspie-friendly framework for understanding empathy, if that's something you'd find interesting.

  Cells enforce cooperation via the use of connexins, as explained in [a recent essay](https://aeon.co/essays/how-to-understand-cells-tissues-and-organisms-as-agents-with-agendas) by Daniel Dennett and Michael Levin:
  > When two cells connect their innards, this ensures that nutrients, information signals, poisons, etc are rapidly and equally shared. Crucially, this merging implements a kind of immediate ‘karma’: whatever happens to one side of the compound agent, good or bad, rapidly affects the other side. Under these conditions, one side can’t fool the other or ignore its messages, and it’s absolutely maladaptive for one side to do anything bad to the other because they now share the slings and fortunes of life. Perfect cooperation is ensured by the impossibility of cheating and erasure of boundaries between the agents. The key here is that cooperation doesn’t require any decrease of selfishness. The agents are just as 100 per cent selfish as before; agents always look out for Number One, but the boundaries of Number One, the self that they defend at all costs, have radically expanded – perhaps to an entire tissue or organ scale.

  Oxytocin seems to "fuse" individuals together in an analogous fashion, like some sort of moral connexin. You can think of it as the same kind of interindividual homeostasis as with cells merged via connexins: you become a part of a greater whole. Which means that alleviating the suffering of others feels just like alleviating your *own* suffering.

  This process builds resilience; by investing effort in meeting the needs of others you are creating a buffer that will protect you in the future. It's simply a robust strategy.

  The emotional aspect of all this is best understood (in my humblest of opinions) via the theoretical construct of [kama muta](https://www.routledge.com/Kama-Muta-Discovering-the-Connecting-Emotion/Fiske/p/book/9780367220945). The kama muta lab[ has defined it thusly](http://kamamutalab.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/kama_muta_in_culture_website.pdf):

  > The thesis of this article is that the sudden intensification of [Communal Sharing Relationships (CSRs)] triggers an adaptive psychological
  > disposition to devote and commit to them. A CSR is one of social equivalence, when people feel in
  > some respect one with others, whether in love, solidarity, fusion, union, patriotism, or identity. People
  > experience this abrupt communal sharing (CS) intensification as an emotion that we call kama muta
  > (Sanskrit, ‘moved by love’). We posit that the psychological disposition to kama muta is responsible for
  > the prevalence, stability, and cultural salience of many culturally evolved practices, institutions, roles,
  > narratives, and artifacts that evoke kama muta.

  They have also published a paper on how the evocation of kama muta seems to be[ one of the key elements of good storytelling](http://kamamutalab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/bestlovedstory.pdf), which you may find interesting.

  [This is an essay rather than a story, but it truly evokes kama muta in me](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/09/14/how-my-mother-and-i-became-chinese-propaganda) (I cried at the end of it). You might benefit from reading it. [The Gift of the Magi](https://americanenglish.state.gov/files/ae/resource_files/1-the_gift_of_the_magi_0.pdf) is also a good example. And if you're looking for a longer, but more enlightening, read, look no further than The Brothers Karamazov. Freud and Einstein both said it was the greatest novel ever written, and I agree. Without spoiling anything, the book explores reason, passion, and love as personified by three brothers. It's well worth the investment of your effort.

  To try and give an explanation for how empathy feels, it's like you're experiencing the pain of someone else, but with a padding of cotton in the middle. Like if you see someone cut their finger, it feels like the memory of a similar pain for you (whether you want it or not), but not like actual, physical pain, and certainly not as localised.

  Emotional empathy is a bit more direct, instead of seeing someone feel an emotion and feeling like a memory of that emotion, it's more like the feeling you get from a memory of something that gave you that emotion. Let me explain it better: You see Bob being sad, you don't feel like you're remembering the sadness of something that made you sad, but like the sadness you feel in remembering that event.

  There's an important caveat that empathy (especially the emotional kind) is directly proportional to how much you like that person.

  Like, if it's someone you really like (say, a spouse that you're still very much in love with (love feels like you might feel for a project that you put years and sweat and blood in, only it can grow to be more important that your own self)), them you might feel an intensity of emotion as high as 95% of theirs, while for a stranger on the street it might be 5 to 25% (depending on how empathetic you are as a baseline).

  Four someone you really hate, empathy might be reversed (antipathy), but there's a strange ratio between dislike and intensity of bad emotion. If a person you just kinda don't like too much is experiencing a low negativity of feeling, you might feel glad (and not admit it to yourself or others, but that's how the monkey-brain is wired), but if they're experiencing a highly negative feeling, you will feel somewhat bad for them. But if it's someone you truly, gutwretchingly hate, the more pain for them the better (up to a certain limit, because sustained hate requires brain chemicals that aren't in endless supply).

  I'm sure I could write it down as an equation, but I don't feel like it right now.

  Anyway, in my view of morality, entities worthy of moral consideration are modelled as having an array of values that correspond to various features of reality that they want to minmax, each with its own weight associated to it. Examples are avoiding pain, increasing pleasure, experiencing stories, leaving a lasting mark in the world, expressing you identity, fairness, discovery, truth, etc. Some are not very important, some are extremely important, some are convergent (useful because they help in increasing all other values, like money, time or intelligence). Also, some entities have just a few of them, like insects, some a lot, like intelligent humans.

  I say this because I think morality is basically the process of decision-making that results in the greatest increase/smallest decrease in the fulfilment of said values for the greatest number of entities. Which means that sometimes, reality being the disappointingly imperfect medium that it is, you'll have to reduce the value for some in order to increase it more for more entities, like we do when we put criminals in jail (and you, filthy scum). Oh, and one of the rules is that you can't deliberately lower the values for someone in order to increase them for someone else, including and particularly yourself, you can only lower someone else's values to avoid them being lowered even more.

  But why am I explaining -what I think to be a good description of- morality to you when you asked about empathy? A couple of reasons.

  One, people will like moral people more, and perceive the it's alright to fuck immoral people over even if they belong to the same team.

  Two, because decreasing someone's values is -what I believe to be- the definition of *harm*. I say this in relation to manipulation, because I think manipulating someone amounts to lowering their value of truth (which is also a convergent value), and it can be moral if in doing so you're increasing some other value for them or achieving a net neutral. Like if you deceive someone on an event that took place but you do so to tell a funny story.

  Regarding ASPD if fiction, I think the best representation of a (criminal) psychopath is Quirrell in HPMoR, and the best (criminal) sociopath is Homelander from The Boys. I fear non-criminal examples are hard to come by, because they're not that useful as characters in stories. EDIT: actually, the best that can easily come to mind are probably from your stories.

  The best neurotypical character that I can suggest is probably Juniper from Worth the Candle, for how he sufferers when he's hurt someone, and for how those feelings are explicitly analysed. Although he's less empathetic than average, the explicit analysis would probably be most helpful to you.

    Ah, gotcha. Nicely illustrated. I love how you went to the effort of building it up from scratch, avoiding assuming any experiential universals (the spouse -> heavily-invested project thing, for instance). Okay, so I think I definitely have this, in the equation you outlined. But from what I understand, it's just usually off or dulled except when I want to feel the same emotion someone else is - so that's one area of divergence. I definitely turn it on when I know I'm going to get a positive hit. 

    Your framework for morality, values, and where manipulation fits in that schema more or less resembles mine. Though, I think there are a lot of strongly culturally-relative aspects to it. If only other people were as consistent as you are with utilitarian value-fulfilment. I guess the difference is, my relationship to morality is more or less the same as my relationship to my model of how the Dewey Decimal system works. I consult it in specific contexts but otherwise it doesn't really intrude too much on my thinking.

    Hmm, I kinda figured there wouldn't be all that many non-criminal psychopathy/borderline sociopaths in media but I'll keep in mind those suggestions in case they reveal any insights. Been meaning to read WtC and watch The Boys for a while now, actually. Guess that'll be my niche. Positive sociopathy representation. Hard enough it might be interesting. Anyway, thank you for this detailed write-up.

      >Though, I think there are a lot of strongly culturally-relative aspects to it.

      It's more than that, I think. Every single person has different values, so in that sense morality is subjective. But in the sense that perfect morality consists in balancing weighted values for different individuals, it can be said to be objective.

      Only, perfect morality is of course practically unachievable, seeing as you can't have a perfect picture of every person's values and weights (and people themselves aren't aware of their own), not to mention that moral decisions are at times time-constrained and you can't be expected to perform the necessary calculation in decision-time.

      But, if you assume that a stranger will tend to have their culture's baseline values and weights, which I think is the most reasonable assumption to make, then that would be the best practical morality that is achievable with available means.

      >If only other people were as consistent as you are with utilitarian value-fulfilment.

      "Never take a compliment from a sociopath," grandma used to say, "that's just *Antisocials 101*". I like to think I have a consistent framework, but who knows.

      >Guess that'll be my niche. Positive sociopathy representation.

      Don't know about sociopathy, but a relevant number of top notch surgeons and lawyers are psychopaths, and not having them shunned from society is a good thing. A whole lot of politicians are too, though, which is unfortunate.

      Anyway, being all pals is nice and good, but you're antisocial, so you work on *quid pro quo*, which means I'd like to trade my (alleged) helpfulness for some understanding.

      It's so hard learning about antisocials, first because they understandably don't tend to advertise their status, if they're even aware of it, and second because when you meed them in person they are trying to filter the information in a way that makes you be more on their side (which I'm hoping will be less of a concern now, as there's a whole internet in between us, and giving a clear picture would probably be the most valuable strategy).

      So, can you tell me what, if anything, makes you sad? And do you enjoy your friends? Meaning, if you pressed the "immanentize my perfect world" button, would they still be interacting with you? Be themselves?

        Sure. 

        > So, can you tell me what, if anything, makes you sad? 

        I'm not affected by sadness as much as most people, I think. I don't grieve or mourn. When bad things happen to me, I deal with them, and when bad things happen to other people, I help them but I don't really share their misfortune on an affective level. It's infrequent, usually very short, and not especially intense. These are the only examples I can think of over the past year:

        1. Finding out it's difficult for people with ASPD to keep to long-term plans, goals, and maintain fulfilling relationships, seeing it in my past. That made me feel sad, empty, and hopeless. That lasted around five to ten minutes. 

        2. Finding out my depression was treatment-resistant. I should note that I've never been suicidal or self-hating, it's mostly the lethargic type of depression and I don't seem to have the usual thought-distortions. The idea that I might be constantly moving from one medication to another, watching them wear off slowly, never being able to live a normal and independent life - made me feel pretty much the same way. Lasted about fifteen to twenty minutes.

        2. I have pretty severe executive dysfunction from ADHD which my psychologist attempted to treat with ritalin and adderall. Both gave me severe panic attacks. The latter I still have a prescription for so I can accumulate a supply in case I need cash. When I don't achieve what I set out to achieve at the end of the day, same as 1 & 2.

        4. I came out as a lesbian to my parents last year. My dad is accepting, my mum not so much. Sometimes when I interact with her, it's a punch to the stomach knowing I'll never have her acceptance. Very intense sadness, mixed with a lot of anger and frustration because every time I think I've made progress with her she seems to backslide. Happened around 4-5 times over the last year, usually lasts 20 minutes or until I try the "articulate how you're feeling, thoughts pass like a train, self-as-context" thing from ACT.

        There were a lot of times where sadness would have been normal, but instead I only felt coldly furious. 

        > And do you enjoy your friends? Meaning, if you pressed the "immanentize my perfect world" button, would they still be interacting with you? Be themselves?

        Definitely. I don't like high-maintenance friendships, though. Constantly texting back and forth throughout the day wears me out. I just prefer to spend an hour, three tops, nothing super deep, just catching up and aimlessly walking and talking, joking around, etc.

        Okay, my turn. I have a few questions about guilt and apologies. Some specific, some vague. 

        * I see in movies there's the cliche of the guilty character avoiding the problem by throwing themselves into work, acting out, behaving erratically - is that true? When I've apparently wronged someone, I just figure out what they want and make it up to them with a gift, wait until they forget, try and reverse the situation by guilt-tripping them, etc. etc. What's the normal thing to do in that situation? Ideally the lowest-cost least-inconvenient thing.

        * Do apologies make you feel subservient in any way?

        How guilty would you feel in these scenarios, and how do you think you would respond both internally on a psychological level and externally on a behavioural level. Sorry if any of these are triggering, you can skip any or all of them if you don't want to do them. 

        0. casually littering

        1. stealing a can of coke from a small business

        2. hitting someone's dog, killing it, with your car and driving away

        3. same as above but with a stranger

        3. stealing enough money from a small business that it causes the owner to go bankrupt

        3. being responsible indirectly for a close friend's suicide

        What you said about empathy and antipathy was interesting. How would your experience of guilt be affected if, say, (1) you were littering on the lawn of a neighbour who repeatedly dumps their trash onto your property, (2) you'd worked at that small business and known the owner to be incredibly abusive and condescending and/or was a neo-Nazi (3) the dog has been keeping you up at night for the last five years and has bitten you (4) you later find out from a police report that the stranger was a serial domestic abuser who left his wife with a permanent debilitating injury and regularly beat his children (5) same as 2 (6) it wasn't a close friend, but instead someone known in the community as a pedophile and an animal-torturer.

        Thanks!

          Not OP but: 

          1) Litter**ing** implies a pattern of behaviour, and I wouldn't feel guilt about a pattern of behaviour I chose to engage in unless I didn't chose it willingly. Assuming you meant "I happened to litter on their property", my answer would be it depends on the intent of the neighbour and what steps I've undertaken myself. If they are being malicious about the trash dumping, then I would not care, except in the sense that I don't really want to stoop to their level and would rather forcibly prevent their dumping then engage in my own. 

          However, if they are dumping out of ignorance or due to some other problem of like dementia or mental illness etc, then I would feel bad. 

          The point of being a higher empathy or more "moral" person sometimes comes down to how reflexively you are able to put yourself in the other person's shoes and thoughts and life experiences that led them to their current point. If you understand or want to understand WHY the neighbor is dumping trash on your yard, then that informs how you react to it. 

          2) A can of coke costs a store $0.25 cents. One can I wouldn't care. I would not make it a continual/pattern thing though.

          3) I'd feel terrible in the moment. The amount of guilt I feel would be moderated mainly by how "at fault" I was in the accident however, if I was speeding or not paying attention then I would feel tremendous guilt after the fact. If the dog ran onto the highway I would not feel any guilt. 

          The barking thing: See #1 about relating to the situation faced by the dog. I'm not the type of person who would passive aggressively endure 5 years of being kept up at night without any confrontation so I can't relate however.

          4) Same as #3. Ending a person's life is much more serious than ending a dog's life however, so scale up guilt appropriately.

          5) The risk reward calculus is rarely worth it for stealing so brazenly as that, unless you somehow legally scammed the owner out of their money. Legal risk/reward calculations aside, assuming it was equivilent to "doing something to put the owner out of business", I would feel less guilty the shittier of a human being the person was

          6) same as 5.

          Alright, lots of stuff there, all very interesting. WARNING: wall of text ahead.

          ANSWERS:

          >I have a few questions about guilt and apologies. Some specific, some vague.

          Ok so as a premise I should probably try to give you some insight into guilt.

          Guilt happens when you did something that hurt someone who you empathise with. This is a completely automatic brain process, so it can sometimes go tits up.

          Example, people may feel guilty for having killed someone who was trying to kill someone else. You'd think the justification of having done what had to be done, and the fact that the dead party was literally a murderer, would assuage any sense of moral responsibility, but the brain doesn't agree. One possible reason for why that is is that the defender has failed in defusing the situation non-mortally, but I personally think it's a matter of evolution not putting enough work into the edge-cases.

          Anyway, guilt *feels* physically like your lungs have gotten heavier and your muscles tense up -hence why shedding guilt is described as "a weight off your shoulders"-, and emotionally like a frequent mental replay of the harm you caused, with the relative empathetic feedback. Obviously, guilt is more intense the more harm you caused.

          People may address guilt by making amends with those they hurt, or by punishing themselves. You may think the second one is madness, and from a certain point of view you'd be right. But keep in mind that guilt is a function of *your* fault, of the self-perceived failure to keep up with your own standards. By self-punishing, people "right the wrong" that they committed. It's basically self-administered justice.

          At the same time, people often tend to rationalise guilt by talking themselves into thinking that their fault was less than it actually was, or that whoever was inconvenienced or harmed somehow deserved it.

          On to your questions.

          >I see in movies there's the cliche of the guilty character avoiding the problem by throwing themselves into work, acting out, behaving erratically - is that true?

          Yes. I doubt sociopaths are immune to procrastination, so I'm assuming you know the feeling. Well, this is a form of procrastination, which is the instinct to avoid the unpleasant feeling associated with a task by doing something else and diverting your attention. Guilt can be a rather strong negative emotion, so is it at all surprising that people would avoid confronting the associated task?

          >try and reverse the situation by guilt-tripping them

          I know that people seldom appreciate unsolicited advice (and please tell me if it annoys you, I'll avoid it), but may I suggest that this is a poor policy? If you do this often, a friend/partner will associate you with the negative feeling, and over time that will anchor the idea of you with discomfort, especially if they perceive, either consciously or subconsciously, that it was unwarranted.

          Seeing as I'm already intruding in your business:

          >I just figure out what they want and make it up to them with a gift

          I'm not exactly surprised this works, but I have my doubts that it works as well as you may want. The optimal thing to do when you wrong someone is to explain that you understand what you did wrong (if you agree that you were wrong from a moral/interpersonal perspective), that you agree not to repeat the mistake in future, and then if you want to go the extra mile you offer a gift as a tangible token of your apology.

          A gift alone may sedate their anger, but also make them feel like you're trying to buy your way out of their distress, which in turn implies that it is an invalid feeling. I don't know if you've ever experienced this other outcome. </advice>

          >Do apologies make you feel subservient in any way?

          Depends. In this context we can say that there are two kinds of apologies, call them sincere and insincere. An insincere apology is when you just say the words and go through the motions to smooth things over, but you feel that your actions and choices were justified. You'll notice people sometimes offer apologies for the way they worded things instead of the content of what they said. An apology like that would not make me feel subservient, and I doubt it does for most people.

          Sincere apologies are when you know that you did something wrong, according to your own parameters (and of course in the context of morality/reciprocity/competent action). When I had to offer this kind of apology in the past, I did feel uncomfortably subservient (obvious, as it basically amounts to admitting you've been inferior to how you yourself recognise you should have been), but it's also kind of unavoidable. You make mistakes -> you lose some status.

          >Sorry if any of these are triggering, you can skip any or all of them if you don't want to do them.

          Far from even making a scratch on my psyche. I was raised by the internet.

          >casually littering

          Internally, I would feel guilty, because I'm contributing to a shared disutility to something which I care about. I would also feel like I'm being lesser than my ideal self. As an external behaviour, I'd ignore it if the trouble to fix it was worse than the guilt I'd get out of it + my own desire to be my best self, and fix it if not, e.g. by recovering my litter or delittering a commensurate amount.

          >stealing a can of coke from a small business

          It's difficult to imagine that I would, but to be honest, not much guilt at all, because the harm to them is fairly minor. Some other people may feel bad for having stolen at all, but I personally don't feel too strongly about petty theft.

          >hitting someone's dog, killing it, with your car and driving away

          I rather doubt that I'd drive away, unless I was under some heavy drugs or the owner came out with a rifle to avenge the dog. In the first case, I would feel *very* guilty, because the connection with a dog is a very intense emotional bond, and also because I like dogs and think the world is better with each pet dog in it, and running over a dog has no upsides to balance that loss. In the second case, I'd feel bad for the decrease in dogginess, but fuck the owner, he's a lunatic and I don't care.

          As for behaviour, I'd offer sincere, deep apologies in the first case, combined with some measure of penance.

          >same as above but with a stranger

          Much more guilty. Dogs are amazing, but a person is a person. I'd feel like I deleted something irreplaceable, not to mention all the suffering it would cause to their relations. Again, I know it must appear crazy to you (and to be honest, to a lot of other people too), but I'd consider going to jail fair and just retribution. Then again, I don't live in the States...

          >stealing enough money from a small business that it causes the owner to go bankrupt

          I had trouble picturing a scenario in which I would do that which didn't involve some dire need. I eventually came to imagine that I stole a lot from someone I thought was super rich, only to find out I had false information, and they actually went bankrupt. But then, I would consider it more an accident than a lapse of my goodness. And yes, I would have caused them harm, but not by falling short of my morals.

          I would feel bad for their misfortune through empathy, and consider myself responsible of their condition and deem a reparation in order, but I wouldn't feel *guilt*. I think. I don't know, I've never been in that kind of situation.

          >being responsible indirectly for a close friend's suicide

          Part 2 (again, sorry)

          >being responsible indirectly for a close friend's suicide

          Pretty fucking terrible. Absolutely awful. I would probably experience depression bordering on suicidal thoughts. I imagine the same goes for most people, it would be a scar on their life which influences their whole outlook from that point onward.

          >How would your experience of guilt be affected if, say, (1) you were littering on the lawn of a neighbour who repeatedly dumps their trash onto your property,

          If it was intentional? Perfectly justified. Zero guilt. Even if I liked the neighbour, in fact (though them dumping their trash in my property would put a serious strain on that). Although I would rather confront them and stop them from dumping refuse on my garden.

          >(2) you'd worked at that small business and known the owner to be incredibly abusive and condescending and/or was a neo-Nazi

          (Incredibly abusive and condescending reads like "murder and jaywalking").

          Zero percent guilty. I'd be a little disappointed in myself for being petty, if the theft was elicited by my dislike, and for being underhanded rather than finding an excuse for punching the bastard in the face.

          I wouldn't steal a drink just because I wanted a drink and didn't like the owner, because it wouldn't help in letting them know they are a bastard (oh yes, that's important, there's always a component of retribution in antipathy, it's not just them not mattering in the moral maths).

          *But*, I can easily picture other people doing it and feeling light as a feather.

          >(3) the dog has been keeping you up at night for the last five years and has bitten you

          Not enough to offset the disutility of the death. I'd feel less guilty, but still guilty. Dogs can't be held responsible like humans, therefore the antipathy doesn't have the same hold. For despising someone you must dislike not *what* they are, but *how* they are. Tell me if this needs further clarification.

          >(4) you later find out from a police report that the stranger was a serial domestic abuser who left his wife with a permanent debilitating injury and regularly beat his children

          Guilt gone. In fact, for me personally (but I suspect not most others) this turn of events would be so convenient that I'd be wary of the bias it gallops on. I'd still feel bad about being the kind of person who runs over a stranger and bolts away, though.

          >(5) same as 2

          This is a bit difficult. I still wouldn't, but it's way easier to imagine stealing from a neo-Nazi, even stealing enough to bankrupt them. if they had no family. I imagine I would feel no guilt. If it sent them under a bridge, then I would, and would try to use the stolen money to at least ensure they lived in reasonable accommodations.

          If the owner was "incredibly \[emotionally?\] abusive"... I would again have trouble imagining stealing so much from them. I have no trouble picturing myself breaking their shop windows every other month, though.

          >(6) it wasn't a close friend, but instead someone known in the community as a pedophile and an animal-torturer.

          I don't think you understand how difficult of a question this is. I will refrain from answering because this comment is already long as it is, but the keyword here is "suicide". If they can commit suicide for the crimes they're guilty of, we're back to the difference between what they are and how they are, and things get complicated.

          The thing worth pointing out is, not liking or even hating a person doesn't just transform them from a moral entity into an instrumental mean. There is utility in bringing comeuppance to hateful people, but they're still taken into account in moral considerations.

          So if instead it's just unwittingly causing an accident that kills them, then somewhat guilty for the animal torturer, maybe even enough to live in emotional distress for weeks, and basically no guilt for the paedophile, particularly if they were recidivist and unrepentant.

          Now, for QUESTIONS:

          * Do you drive like a madwoman?
          * What are your tastes in fiction, art, and music, if you want to share? How are they influenced, it at all, by your ASPD, to the best of your ability yo discern?
          * This is a bit silly, but is there anything at all, like maybe an ideal, for which you would spontaneously decide to give your life in order to protect/uphold?
          * It's interesting to me that you can manage to guilt-trip someone without an explicit understanding of guilt. How does that work from your perspective?
          * Are you trying to correct for your narcissistic tendencies, now that you have a better understanding of what your deal is? Are you trying to develop a more unbiased picture of yourself?

  If you want some more recommendations coming from a different place than the typical "rationalist" demographic (read: young males who like fantasy/scifi), here's a few things I recommend that come from different places:

  - Jane the Virgin (TV show, on netflix) - this is my #1 recommendation. It centers around three generations of Venezuelan-American women living in California, and about family relationships and romance. I consider it "rational" in how it handles interpersonal conflict/etc, and would recommend it to anyone who wants a different point of view.  EDIT: I didn't mention its main selling point: it is an absolutely hilarious comedy in the style of a telenovella. The premise is that a woman who is saving herself for marriage is accidentally artificially inseminated.

  - Tamora Pierce, specifically The Song Of The Lioness, but also The Protector of The Small (each is a series of 4 YA books). This is a sword and sorcery world with lots of sympathetic characters with realistic motivations/etc though the magic is of course Magic. EDIT: main selling point, since this is fantasy: it's written for girls and is about girls

  - Luminosity, a twilight fanfic. It's a bit more Logical than I'd normally recommend, but it's focusing on manipulating people, her own happiness/moral compass, and Doing Good, so it's probably in there

  - For something more philosophical, maybe try reading Peter Singer or other "Effective Altruism"-adjacent philosopher? The Life You Can Save or one of his animal liberation books might give you a good/different perspective. EDIT: these are non-fiction in case that wasn't clear

  - I'm going to do a self-plug here: I'm writing a rational vampire romance novel that I've been posting to the sub on my other "author" username, it's called Vampire Flower Language and it's *all* about this sort of thing. There's also a character who appears towards the end who is effectively a sociopath but with an unusual value function. You might find it interesting.

  I'm guessing it took a lot of courage to come out about this, if I were a psychopath I'd probably be too terrified to talk about it with anyone. I used to be autistic my whole life until very recently, I was the most socially oblivious person I know and now I'm probably the 3rd or 4th most socially sensitive person I know. My whole world's opened up and I'm much happier and more hopeful for the future now. It's been amazing.

  Communities and even civilization itself are made of relationships. Relationships are fluid implicit ecosystems of series of mutual exchanges which depend on trust to be sustainable. Your trust in others can be built by exposing your vulnerabilities or weaknesses to others who then choose not to take advantage of your weakness (taking advantage = using your weakness to hurt you for their own gain).

  When you trust someone else enough, you can delegate to them far more easily, you can rely on them to cover for your weakness with their strength, you can willingly trust them with part of the steering wheel because you know they won't try to hurt you with it. This will save you a LOT of time and effort in your life.

  But they won't want to do that stuff totally for free unless they're your parents. You'll need to prove yourself worthy of other people's trust too. This will make it so you don't need to waste time and effort bullying people into helping you because they'll often *want* to help you of their own free will.

  And other people will always have the right to say no to you, they personally dont have to help you. Which is okay because there are always more people out there you can turn to for help.

  If you get good enough at this (and if the necessary communal infrastructure to incentivize it is readily available) you may eventually get to the point where you can get anything you want or need most of the time without ever needing to hurt anyone, so long as you are patient and willing to give other people what they want or need in return.

  Also, the fundamental type of skill used for empathy and relating to other people is made of imagination and intuition.

  (Psychologists dont understand human nature as well as they think they do.)

  Hope that helps! :)

  P.S. My main altruistic motives for trying to help you with this post (altruistic = what I want to give) is that I see a bit of myself in you and want to help, I like helping people and I feel like it will make the world a safer place, both because people won't need to fear you anymore and also because then you could help others in turn the same way I'm trying to help you. My main non-altruistic motives (what I want to receive in return) are that it makes me feel more useful and valuable to contribute to the lives of others like this, and that the more people who learn to engage in healthy mutually beneficial relationships the easier it will be to sustain the modular social infrastructure I need to survive long-term and safely make it to the stars.

  The values of human beings who aren't antisocial can be kinda meta and fractal like that. Also our values ultimately are made out of processes that are not values in and of themselves.

    Interesting take. I've read over it a couple of times over the last few days and I'm just going to quickly capture some of my responses. I'll update later if I think of anything else.

    * There are a lot of behavioural differences between psychopaths and sociopaths, but it's fuzzy. I still feel warmth towards my friends and family, I have a tendency to lash out vindictively and pettily where a psychopath would calmly accept the situation and take the arena to the longer-term, and there are a few times where I've felt some kind of guilt even if it's a 'once every 4-5 years' thing. So my mind isn't as alien as you might be assuming and I'm going to continue the more-or-less prosocial trajectory I've been going down.

    * I understand what you've written about relationships, community, and mutual trust. The issue is that it's very easy to have a skewed quid pro quo where one side is getting a lot more out than they're putting in. I have a lot of those relationships, and they either don't notice or don't seem to mind all that much. Sometimes it leaves them feeling better off, some people get a kick out of being nice to charity cases or feeling superior/unindebted. Trust is the same. It's very easy to give someone false or minor vulnerabilities and get much more in return. I rarely threaten, bully or intimidate. The role I'm playing is kind, polite, empathetic, and helpful. If you were to examine how I interact with other people, you probably wouldn't find anything more manipulative or objectionable than a political campaign email or a brochure arguing against evolution written by a Creationist. I'm saying that mainly because I'm reading a lot of concern and worry from you and I just want to assure you.

    * Thanks for outlining your motives! I'm not really fazed by malign intentions but it helped me understand where you're coming from and why you wrote the post.

      Are you sure you're accurately assessing the cost/benefit to both parties of keeping up the relationship? What you're writing about trust makes me think your view of relationships has way too much of a short term bias. The value of long-term relationship with deep mutual trust is something it seems like you're missing.

      You're welcome! I'm glad you found it interesting. Now I'm wondering if the difference between psychopaths and sociopaths might have something to do with the fundamental types of motivations. Maybe a sociopath wants to exploit other people, receiving the most benefit for the least effort spent. In other words, *decreasing scope of influence*. And maybe a psychopath wants to control other people, ensuring that they always are in a dominant and therefore safe and well-off position. In other words, *increasing scope of influence*. Meaning that given the choice, a sociopath would be more likely to prefer the path of least resistance while a psychopath would prefer the opposite.

      Not to say that you don't ever do hard work or take on any big responsibilities, but I suspect from what you said that when you do take on such things that it is often for the purpose of making it so you have less hard work or responsibility to deal with later. Does that sound right?

      Also I suspect that you might find the following fanfiction series *very* relatable and funny, it's about a version of Harry Potter who gets sorted into Hufflepuff even though he hates hard work, and he goes out of his way doing hard work in order to save himself a lot more time and effort later: https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6466185/1/Harry-the-Hufflepuff

  I'm loving the 2 section answers today, apparently.  First one is the mental health stuff that I hope is helpful but you might be sick of hearing.  Second is a pointer on how to simulate the emotions your characters might feel.

  ***********

  Have you actually seen a doctor about this?  Self-diagnosis is considered incredibly unreliable by anyone who's studied psychology for any significant amount of time and there are a number of disorders that can lead to a feeling that one lacks a conscience.  Anything that causes dissociative symptoms for example, can lead to a person thinking that about themselves, as can those disorders which interfere with connecting with others such as ASD or heck, even ADHD.  Your conclusions and beliefs about yourself are valid and I dont want to take away from that, but, well, I'd like to point out your interactions with people definitely seem more (asd+social anxiety) or (ocd+social anxiety) than aspd. The first clue is that you seem to consider your behavior as bad behavior, and the second is that you haven't escalated to serious crimes afaict. ^(The clue for social anxiety is that you posted about your concerns online rather than talking to a trusted person face to face.) 🙃

  ***********

  As for giving characters a more nonrobotic feel, maybe try out giving them complex goals or needs and wants, then scale the events they experience based on how those needs and wants are affected, and assign an emotion based on the scale and the character's personality.  For example a big setback for a character who is prone to acting without thinking might lead to anger, while a more introspective character might get sad and self-blame. The level of setback × the level of importance to the character might be a scale for how upset they get.  If this framework seems reasonable to you, give the more "moral" characters more community focused perceived needs and wants, or a larger perceived community, and the more "amoral" characters a more selfish outlook.  And if you get the analysis wrong sometimes, well that's just more realistic.

    First of all, thank you! I'll try and bullet-point my responses to avoid going off-track.

    > Have you actually seen a doctor about this?

    * A lot of this occurred to me too, so it's good to have a second opinion from someone who (I'm guessing) has studied psychology seriously. Yeah, there's a lot of potential symptomatic overlap with ASD in terms of affective and empathetic deficits, ADHD with impulsivity and lack of concern for safety, and obviously BPD too with unstable relationships and dissociation. I've been diagnosed with the first two, BPD doesn't seem to fit.

    * I'm not really sure whether I care much about a formal diagnosis. So far I've found that researching ASPD has clarified some parts of my behaviour I was very confused about before, made a lot about my past snap into focus, and has had a great deal of predictive power in modelling how I'll respond to new situations (where my weaknesses lie, etc.). If there's a symptomatic overlap, it's apparently enough to be a useful label. That's basically it.

    * I have a deep distrust for how I narrate my internal experience and in thinking about ASPD I mainly look towards behaviour not how I subjectively perceive things. I think I have a pretty good insight into my subsecond-level thought processes but again, I don't like to rely on it since it's easy to impose a top-down interpretation. I'm not sure what would count as a serious crime, but I have a very long history of delinquency and conduct disorder going back to around age 6-7. Some examples of that include "hacking" (guessing the password) the head girl's school account to embarrass her on her personal page, publicly vandalising and encouraging other people to vandalise the entire campus, sending in a request to change another student's name to a typo, and breaking into several glass displays to replace school posters with edited versions. There are ten to fifteen other examples that were similarly severe occurring every single year from primary to the end of high school, and sixty to a hundred more instances where I wasn't caught (e.g stealing nearly half the school's calculators, wiping the contents of a teacher's computer, a shit ton of cyberbullying, cheating on tests and exams whenever I could, plagiarising by using non-English sources and google-translating them for most of the essays I wrote, rigging student council votes, regularly stealing cash during business competitions and when I worked the tuck shop register etc.). Plus the usual stuff like wagging class to go play poker or get fish and chips. I'm avoiding mentioning the stuff that I'm guessing would just sound vile and cruel to you. I'm frankly baffled that I managed to avoid being expelled or getting the police involved, and I attribute that to my middle-class parents reaching for ASD as an easy explanation, along with my impeccable politeness, charming over teachers, and superb grades. There's a mismatch. It was enough that even I overlooked it until this year. 

    * When I think outside of school, in clubs, and in my personal life, there's a lot of stuff I should feel bad about but... don't. And apparently, didn't, given that I never attempted to do whatever you're supposed to do when you feel bad about something. The absence of remorse and guilt is kind of the thing I'm the most certain about. When I think back to them, mainly I remember how funny or thrilling they were, or the great reputation it gave me. Or that other people were over-reacting, felt like their status was threatened, etc. If I had a chance to go back, I'd probably do all of them again but maybe more cleverly, managing the aftermath better. ASPD for me kind of clarifies why I repeatedly got into trouble and never seemed to "learn" or really care whether what I was doing was "right". The only thing I ever seem to regret is not manipulating the situation well enough.

    * You're warm with social anxiety. It's now more social avoidance than anxiety in the sense that I try to avoid social situations but feel fine when I'm in the middle of them. I think if someone were to look at me between year 10 (13-14) and now, the thought that I might have social anxiety wouldn't occur to them. I kind of realised there was this persona I could tap into which regularly blew everyone else out of the water in drama, inter-school debates, and speech competitions. I lead several clubs (mostly into ruin). Class clown, I guess. I surrounded myself with friends, although come to think of it, I never allowed myself to be below anyone else and I was mostly surrounded by lackeys who did whatever I convinced them to. I just love the theatre involved in playing out different roles, tricking and messing with people. Now, I mainly keep to five-ish close friends and I have a pretty equal standing with them, I think. I'm not gregarious, but I have zero issue with strangers and I can handle myself well. 

    * The main reason why I'm posting here is because I frankly do not trust anyone not to fuck me over eventually and the cons usually outweigh the pros since mentioning ASPD or sociopathy will tint my relationships with people. There's one friend I'm going to tell, once I've figured out the best strategy and what parts of ASPD I want to present & in what ways. My reading is he can't and won't leverage it against me, I'm not planning to pump money or anything else from him, and it'll be less mentally-taxing to just let down the facade. Here, on the other hand? Very few downsides, 30-40 people just giving me free, useful, non-judgemental advice.

    * Regarding what I've noticed about my thoughts, I think it would be difficult to chalk the conscience aspect to dissociation. If I have a conscience, I don't really notice it. I catch myself thinking of lies when talking to people, the "this is factually untrue" thing only seems to come after the initial idea, and I don't really distinguish between "good" or "bad" actions beyond calculating how it might appear to someone else and how I might spin it. On a conscious level I had this edgy attitude that morality was just kind of stupid and not something I should bother emulating. Dunno. The only objective good or bad is to what extent I benefit. No idea how else I should see it.

    * Some practical reasons why I don't want to get a diagnosis at the moment. (1) ASPD diagnoses have been used as justification to extend prison-terms, as aggravating factors in crimes, and to deny parole/early release. I'm mindful my streak of luck might run out and I'll find myself interacting with the criminal justice system. In that case, it would be a very bad idea since apparently psychologists, counsellors, and psychotherapists are compelled to testify in those scenarios. (2) Costs money. (3) Not sure what value I'd get from it. A 'yes' or a 'no', wouldn't change much.

    Okay, this seems doable. What you mentioned with different emotional responses to setbacks is actually something I never considered before explicitly. I can see that developing a wide range of characters without falling back on my own thought-habits is going to be tricky. I didn't think of the community/self continuum either, seems clear now but I think I'll make this one part of the standard template.

      When you say you "should" feel bad but don't, what led you to believe that you should feel bad? Other people telling you or other people's reactions? 

      You should try understand their perspective of WHY they think you should feel bad or why they feel bad themselves, i.e. what life experiences and thought process led to that conclusion. If you get that, then you can write about it or make characters who think that way to. If you don't, then why don't you just ask them?

      Most people by nature are happy to be helpful to their friends and acquaintances when they are being approach for advice or for their thoughts. If you are having trouble understanding these social things, just phrase the question like "remember when XYZ happened and you were horrified? You know I'm not the most socially intelligent person right, I never actually got why everyone was horrified. Can you explain why you thought that was so bad?".

  What happens when you lean into that sense of intuitive empathy, or try to keep it on all the time?

  Also curious how you feel in relation to familial love, best friendship, and romantic love.  What would you feel in this scenario?

  * Stranded together on a deserted island with your entire family, best friend, and your lover of the past 3+ years who have all suffered from a spontaneous lobotomising disease to which you are immune, over the course of seven days you witness their rapid deterioration into mindless husks despite your best efforts to cure them.  If you spend multiple minutes diving as emotionally deep into this hypothetical as possible -- imagining your futile struggle to cure them, feelings as you watch them slowly lose their sense of self before your eyes, all with the (let's say not totally vain) hope that maybe you can fix this -- what sensations does your body feel, if any?

  There's the theory that ASPD may come from a long lack of practice rather than a complete inability to engage with emotions on a deep level.  It may be worthwhile to try to embrace and sink into whatever emotional senses you have, and observe whether they grow stronger over a consistent yearlong period.  You may also be able to take a few shortcuts, which I won't discuss here.  Feel free to PM me if you're curious.

    Well, I turn it on pretty much only when I'm reading or watching television. Usually when something good is about to happen to one of the characters, or whenever I feel like I need a good emotional kick to loosen up my brain. I'm still new to articulating a lot of this. So for one thing? Not really sure how to do it manually. For another, it just doesn't ever register as off. It's the default, I don't notice it - so it never occurs to me that I should turn it on in the first place. Dunno, kind of like being instructed to wiggle your ears all the time. 

    But I think I'll give it a try the next time I'm talking to someone, that seems like a sensible suggestion.

    Desert island scenario. Oh damn, that would suck. Kinda outside of my reference frame in terms of traumatic experiences. Closest thing I've had was an uncle I don't really know that well dying. The only thing I remember from that was making a resolution to destroy death. Didn't really grieve at all, just thought it was a senseless and stupid way to die. 

    So really? I guess it would be a good opportunity to get to know as much about their lives as possible. I imagine I would throw myself into the task of systematically identifying a cure, not really much point being dragged down with other stuff. It would definitely be super uncomfortable and creepy, and I would be left with a feeling of loss. An unfillable void in the universe, possibilities that never came to fruition. I would feel hopeless throughout the process? I'm not sure. Oh, anxiety. Hot burbling feeling in my tummy/chest. I'm definitely getting that now, that would be stressful as hell. I'm noticing I'm not experiencing as strong of an emotional reaction as I expected. My mind is kind of drifting to where I'd go after that and how to rebuild my support network. I love them and appreciate them, I feel much more empathetic towards them than I do by default, but I'm guessing something is off here. I get the feeling I'm filling in some kind of affectual gap and I don't entirely trust how I map body sensations to emotional labels, especially in this scenario.

    If it's an issue of practice - perfect. Familiar territory. But I'm curious about those shortcuts, too. Anyway, this was a really nice thought-experiment, really clarified a lot of my thoughts. Thank you.

      You're welcome, and I'm glad it helped!  I've set up an e-mail reminder so I'll be notified if you DM me for more practice and shortcuts.

      You did a really good job working your way through the sensations of the thought experiment.  If you can, imagine staying in each stage of sensation you felt ten times longer.  The hopelessness, the hot burbling, the loss and unfillable void.  Some people are capable of feeling all of those at once for days at a time.  This is what informs how others make their decisions at times.

      Love is the most irrational and emotional of human interactions, so I think it's an excellent lens through which to help focus your practice.

  *The Summer Tree* by Guy Gavriel Kay has a rather heartwrenching account of the effects of guilt on one of the characters. I would highly recommend it on its own merits also, a somewhat emotionally intense fantasy novel. The series it is in is called *The Fionavar Tapestry*- I mention this because you might find only the omnibus version in bookstores.

  Otherwise, I guess *Ender's Game* is an account of deep and intrinsic feelings of shame at the necessities Ender is forced/feels he needs to take, though Ender is hardly ordinary.

Effective moral characters who aren't also super OP are rare.) Since you have a competitive advantage there, why bother changing your style?

    Oh, I don't want to change my style. I'm focused on my own growth and development as a writer. Learning that all my characters are just carbon copies of me with the details filed off? Ouch. Morality is apparently a really fundamental and adds a lot of colour and complexity to characterisation. It's kind of like a painter learning she's colour-blind. If I can really get how neurotypicals tick, an experiential spectrum opens up. I care a lot about being faithful to canon. If something is off, that sucks. I get what you mean. It'd be easier to keep writing the way I do now. I just want to do that and more.
