  And Aaron has one of his moments of intelligence again... There may yet be hope for him.

  Now I'm curious at how pissed at him Jane is going to be.
  ```

  - u/thecommexokid:
    ```
    Especially when Aaron now feels compelled to mention that he's had her missing dragon this whole time.
    ```

  ```
  So ... [this](http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/04/21/universal-love-said-the-cactus-person/) is canon? Drug Lord will visit San Francisco confirmed? Where's the green bat?
  ```

  - u/ScottAlexander:
    ```
    I wrote that story and the draft of this chapter at the same time and based on the same theme. The story was about someone asking hallucinogenic entities why they weren't consequentialists. The Drug Lord is what would happen if they *were*.

  Apropos of nothing, I wonder how different the textile industry is in their world given that they're not allowed to mix fabrics.

    But Jane is the one who brought up TOK in the first place, and warned that he'd be looking. That seems like it would be a bad move for the actual Other King...
    ```

    - u/InfernoVulpix:
      ```
      Unless that's exactly what Jane wants Aaron to think, to convince him she's not the Other King.  You can't expect to outmaneuver a smart person by hoping they just won't think of the possibility.
      ```

    - u/DCarrier:
      ```
      If "she" hadn't, he'd leave Trump Tower the moment he wakes. As it is, he might wait for her. And if he doesn't wake, then the warning doesn't really matter.
      ```

- u/Cruithne:
  ```
  Let's talk about the Kabbalah of Trump Tower.

  Trump is connected to the French verb 'tromper'- to fool.

  In the Tarot deck, the Fool is either high or low, like the Ace. The Trump card, if you will. This is not a coincidence etc.

  Aaron acted foolishly, and he is high on peyote, and high at the top of Trump Tower. No points for guessing what value the Fool has in this game.

  The obvious interpretation of Tower is the Tower of Babel. Hell, it was specifically mentioned in this chapter. The story of the Tower is that mankind was punished and divided for building too close to Heaven.

  So would Trump Tower mean 'To overreach in your deception'? A bit like what the Drug Lord did.

    ```
    Bab-El is the Gate of God, though, which suggests the equivalence of placebomancy and kabbalah.

  I won't tell you the Name until you ~~factor the number~~ answer in Aramaic.
  ```

- u/ZeroNihilist:
  ```
  Apparently Jinxiang means "gold hometown". I'm trying to think what that could be referencing. Is there anywhere in the US that's called the "golden city"? There's Golden State I think, and San Francisco has the Golden Gate Bridge, but I don't know enough US geography to come up with better candidates.
  ```

    ```
    alas, the possible meanings are multitude.

    the one you mentioned is 金乡. There is also 尽享 - to enjoy utterly, 金相 - golden face/look or even golden minister
    ```

    - u/ThatDarnSJDoubleW:
      ```
      > to enjoy utterly

      Transcendent joy?
      ```

      - u/usui_no_jikan:
        ```
        It's literally "enjoy to the end", so more like squeezing all the hedonium out of something :(
        ```

    - u/ZeroNihilist:
      ```
      Golden minister is surprisingly plausible in this setting. In UNSONG style, I hope all of them are true.
      ```

- u/STL:
  ```
  Typos for /u/ScottAlexander :

  > “I didn’t **said** you would have to.”

  > I was Quetzalcoatl, the feathered serpent, Tezcatlipoca the smoking mirror, Huitzilopochtli the left-handed hummingbird.

  The first comma is inconsistent.

  > The Drug Lord looked down at me bemusedly, smile still playing on his features.

  Should probably say "a smile".

  > Not to mention that if I told you the Name, the Drug Lord, who’s listening in on us for sure, would **overheard**.

  > what I felt when I said I was coming to rescue me.

  Really confusing, are pronouns swapped here?

  > [I’ll trust you,] I thought [if you can answer me one question]

  Missing punctuation.

  > [..and if I ever make a pun

  Should be three dots for an ellipsis.

  > you should just assume I’m possessed by the Drug Lord again]

  Missing period.
  ```

- u/GrecklePrime:
  ```
  Since nothing is ever a coincidence, why is this labeled as Chapter 37 when it's actually Chapter 38?
  ```

  - u/ScottAlexander:
    ```
    My fault; I originally mislabeled it on the book, then edited it once someone told me.
    ```

    - u/GrecklePrime:
      ```
      Death of Author though, you might think there isn't a reason but your story is literally telling us there is. I will not rest until we have solved this mystery!
      ```

      - u/Frommerman:
        ```
        This chapter is based at least in part on asking DMT entities to factor very large relative primes. 37 is a prime number, and its only factors are itself and one. 38 is a relative prime of 2 and 19. This is not a coincidence because nothing is a coincidence.

        Thus, the only possible chapter number for this chapter is 38, and your memories of it having been 37 must have been falsified. Perhaps by a DMT entity.
        ```

      ```
      Edit: I fixed this, but I might have broken your link.
