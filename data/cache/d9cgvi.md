  I will throw in that a main character who is less knowledgeable or competent than the average reader can heavily turn a reader off, at least from my limited experience, with the frustration of characters repeatedly being utter idiots. One of the appeals of rational fiction is avoiding plot forced stupidity, but replacing that with a character who makes obviously stupid choices because they lack knowledge that the majority of the readers possess can drive people away. I get what youâ€™re saying, but this can end up with characters frustratingly missing things.

      And I agree, but someone bring rational with no information can still be infuriating, and can end up with either being too trusting or paranoid of everything.

  >what if we have a character that independently comes to smart conclusions. To "reinvent the wheel" as I invoke the cliche.

  I think it's all about going back to first principles.  And I think this is often a more interesting way to do things.  This is how you get around, as you say, having a "rational character having survival knowledge because the author googled the answers."  Don't give them the answers; give them the questions, and then let them figure out the answers.  (If they're really smart, they should be capable of going through that thought process!)

  As an example: thanks to the "weapon triangle" in the Fire Emblem video games a lot of people now know that spears are favored against swords.  However, if your knowledge is solely based on having played Fire Emblem, "spears beat swords" is basically axiomatic: "Spears are favored against swords, because when a sword user fights a spear user, the spear user gets a 15% accuracy bonus and the spear user gets a 15% penalty."  Okay, that explains how the interaction is formalized in the game's systems, but that doesn't really explain *why* spears beat swords.  

  The main reason that spears beat swords is because spears have more reach: if you have a spear, you can engage the sword user at a greater distance than the sword user's reach.  And if the sword user manages to close that distance, the spear user can simply "choke up" on their spear (gripping it closer to the tip), to turn their long-range spear into a short-range weapon as the circumstances require.  So really, spears beat swords at range, and spears can have approximate parity with swords in close quarters.  These are all things that a person could derive on their own if they spent enough time sparring with spears and swords, without ever needing an expert to come along and explain to them that spears are advantaged against swords.

  You can also "close the gap" between your characters' understanding and the knowledge they need to have by giving them background knowledge that lets them construct useful analogies that they can use to justify their own reasoning.  For example, suppose you have a character who gets isekai'd from a contemporary setting to a medieval fantasy world, and they figure out through through sparring that swords lose to spears.  "Man," they say to themselves, "swords are for chumps!  Why would anyone ever carry a sword, when a spear is such a better weapon?"  And then, after mulling over it a bit, they might recall that, back on earth, people routinely carry handguns around for defense, even though rifles are capable of firing shots much more quickly and accurately: yes, if you know that you're marching off to battle, you'd rather have an AR-15 than a glock, but when you're going to the laundromat or convenience store, it's easier to carry a glock than an AR-15: its more compact form factor makes it easier to carry, and you can casually walk around carrying one without drawing a large amount of attention to yourself.  One is a weapon for soldiers who are marching off to battle, and one is a weapon for adventurers who might occasionally have to defend themselves from assailants as they run around performing their errands/fetch quests.  They can figure all of this out based on their own background knowledge without needing a wise mentor or genre-savvy companion who gives them a lecture to say, "The reason that adventurers favor swords over spears is..."

  In "rational" fiction, there's a temptation to say, "this person got isekai'd to a medieval world, and they know everything that they have to know because they were a medieval scholar with a Ph.D in European history," but oftentimes, it would be more interesting to have a character who takes the lessons that they learned in a contemporary urban setting and apply them to a medieval setting, because that gives them a learning arc that we're able to follow.  They don't have to start from *zero* knowledge, but having a character who *figures out* what they need to know can be a lot more fun than a character who simply starts with all of the knowledge that they need. Shouldn't "rational" fiction focus on characters who are actually rational, as opposed to being merely knowledgeable about a specific subject?  Smart people are smart because they're good at *finding* answers to tough questions, not being conveniently imbued with all of the answers to every problem they encounter.

  There's also a certain level of plausibility that you gain when you aren't giving your characters rare knowledge.  Having a character who knows all of the streets they need to navigate in a zombie apocalypse because they delivered pizzas or drove for Uber is a lot more plausible than having a character who knows every street and every tunnel in the city because they were an urban planner who worked for the city (and realistically, the delivery driver will probably also have a lot more experience with *navigating* that environment than someone who is used to viewing the city layout through diagrams).  A person who knows how to handle themselves in a rough neighborhood learning about medieval combat feels a lot more plausible than a medieval history expert learning to be an expert fighter because they're really good at applying their book learning in combat.

  You can apply this to social problems as well.  A character who finds themselves whisked off to space and forced to interact with cultures on other planets isn't going to know everything that they need to know about alien cultures.  They aren't going to be able to know just from looking at a different species, "Oh, that guy's a Klingon, which means that he values honor, and detests cowardice."  But they can go back to first principles: our human protagonist knows that everyone responds to incentives, and what incentives they respond to most strongly will be based partly on the value systems that exist within their culture, and so our protagonist can start negotiating with another species by first adopting an inquisitive posture in order to figure out what that alien's value system is.  Some aliens care purely about material profit, while others care about things like "honor."  With certain alien species, it's best to be friendly and magnanimous during negotiation to engender trust, and with others, it's most strategic to be cagey and keep your cards close to their chest.  Our protagonist will do all of these things not because they read a textbook about alien cultures or "learned about Klingons from Startfleet Academy," but because within several minutes of meeting a Klingon (or observing as they negotiate with a third party), you can make a pretty good guess as to what kind of behavior is likely to offend and what kind of behavior is likely to appeal to them.  Occasionally, our human protagonist will make the wrong call and do the wrong thing due to an incorrect reading of the situation, and we'll be okay with that because cultural misunderstandings happen, and when they produce conflict, that makes the narrative more interesting.

    Minor nitpick of your excellent post: if someone gets in close when you're using a spear, you're much better off using it like a quarterstaff than choking up on it. Quarterstaffs are hard as hell to fight against because a moderately skilled user can attack from virtually any direction at once by alternating between the two ends, plus can strike at range with a thrust that will be nearly as effective as a spear. It can also deflect swords if you got them on the flat, and if the staff is solid enough (eg ironwood) you can even block the sword's edge with only minimal damage.

    I should add in with the spear example our protagonist should have a basic grasp of stuff, usually unrelated but useful. Such as "They say the spear is the king of weapons yet swords are so cool, I wonder why." Or the more mundane logic of "I should grab a spear because I'd rather not get people close to me." Basically people can come to conclusions with basic logic without an informed choice or trial and error.

    Or to the insulation example from earlier, MC-kun knows what insulation is and that it is important but has no idea exactly how it's done. They make their best guess of leaves and eventually replace it after they learn something completely different and realise they can apply that.

    And for a third example, explaining something through an entirely different discipline. This is rare and also my favourite trope.  In your group is a pharmacist and a biologist, who is currently performing surgery? A butcher, she might be more familiar with taking animals apart yet in a pinch she knows how to remove that arrow and stitch you up without knicking an artery or tearing muscles. The only problem is your anesthetic and disinfectant are a bottle of vodka because that's the only thing she knows that would work. (She almost used urine cause she wanted a shot as well.)

  From the writers perspective, one good option is to take the excuses away and the temptation with it. To take the protagonist 10000 years in the future, or another planet, or even another plane of existence. Someplace where basic shit like how the fauna behaves, the chemistry of plants, how to make a shelter and things like that can't be explained as previous knowledge. The protagonist will have to learn things the hard way and the audience gets to learn it with him. 

  He may need a reasonable starting safety net, like a brief contact with someone from there, otherwise the amount of luck he will need to survive the first few days are gonna get unrealistic. Employing common sense should be fine, as long as it's doesn't leave the audience scratching their heads. Also, and this is paramount, the protagonist should have at least as many fails as he has successes if not more. Successes make for great "lighting the beacon of hope" epic scenes while fails can ramp up the stakes, creating tension, dread or new challenges. One keeps the reader around, while the other keeps the story fresh.

  As to how not to write shitty characters, that's another very long conversation I'm not going to get into here. Suffice to say, there is plenty of literature on the subject.

  As for examples or recommendations, unfortunately I can't say I have any good ones.

    I have some space australia story I dusted off and changed to something more original. My limitations were everyone is a blue collar worker and their chain of command is gone. Everyone else got routed and the only ship to arrive was labourers. My biggest ass-pull so far was a foreman half remembering that they used to make gunpowder from piss. They know what it's made of but have no idea what the hell potassium nitrate is.

    I'm trying to make a story of people trying to reverse engineer technology when they have no idea how things are made. And then applying their own knowledge and frame of reference to it. (The local craftsmen spent a month trying to make guns and the best they could do is shotguns after one month.) Then I tried to work on things they can accomplish with what they know already. E.g. We got concrete buildings, working plumbing, and aqueducts; but no one has any medical skills beyond treating wounds. At least we have three fully functioning and well stocked bars. We may have no agriculture besides the few guys who had gardens back home, but hey we know how to use steel!

  Something more like "Hatchet"? Reasonably intelligent but not a know it all and makes lots of mistakes.

  An interesting point is The Silent Tower and The Silicon Mage. You can make the research part of the story.

  In the first book, a character from earth ends up in a medieval world and is hopelessly lost. She quickly picks up some skills and is competent, but clearly out of her element and cannot do basic things like start a fire.

  In the second book, she is ready for a return trip. She did read a few books and took a survival class. She also picked up some clothes that fit that other world better, added some necessities, as well as tools, a gun, and some synthetic gems to barter for coin of the realm. She kept it in a bug-out bag in her trunk.

  It worked very well to reverse the damsel in distress believably.

  >The personalities of these characters tend to either be flat or autistic. Sometimes they even are borderline sociopathic... The amount of "love is just a chemical" and "I only see other people as things I can use" types are starting to grate on me."

  We're clearly reading very different rational fiction... which stories contain protagonists who say stuff like this?

  While I do agree with you, it must be said that this is much more difficult to write well and with good pacing than just waving it away. One way to do it is explaining the process afterwards instead of narrating it as it happens, or doing it very very concisely like: tried X + Y didn't work, maybe X + T will work..
