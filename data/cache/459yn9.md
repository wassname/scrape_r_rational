## [Challenge Companion] New Age

### Post:

"New Age" has always been a little bit hard to characterize, because the term embodies so many distinct beliefs. In some ways I see it as a natural progression from the Protestant Reformation. The Protestants believed that spiritual truth came from the Bible, not from the Church, while the New Agers believe that spiritual truth comes from the self, not the Bible. It's a further step away from centralized spiritual authority. Of course, in practice most people aren't trying to develop their own spiritual truth from base principles, just as most Protestants weren't (and aren't) trying to develop their own understanding of God independent of any church. Instead, there's some amount of ad hoc centralization happening, and the New Age movement is filled with people who have made themselves into thinkers and experts (which happens with every group).

I used to work as a janitor at a local food co-op which sold magnetic healing bracelets and homeopathic remedies, and I thought about the pseudoscience aspects of the New Age stuff quite often, mostly because I was surrounded by people who bought into it. To some extent I think the pseudoscience is an outgrowth of the spiritual, since there's not that much of a jump to go from believing in the self as the source of spiritual truth to believing in the self as the source of physical truth. Or it might be that most of the New Age varieties join the spiritual with the physical instead of separating them out into non-overlapping magisteria.

Of course, one of the things that defines New Age as a Western phenomenon is that it tends to borrow from other cultures and remix them in its own way (in some ways the Tex-Mex of spiritualism) and I'm not sure where that fits in either.

For reading, try Chuck Palahniuk's short story "Foot Work" (collected in *Haunted*) features feng shui assassins and reflexology prostitutes and is one of my favorites from that book. Also the comic [What if it was all true](http://english.bouletcorp.com/2015/04/11/what-if-it-was-all-true/) from the Bouletcorp. Or [this Mitchell and Webb sketch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMGIbOGu8q0). I'd also highly suggest reading the (non-fictional) article [The Cowpox of Doubt](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/04/15/the-cowpox-of-doubt/). If you have any more, link them below.

As always, this is the challenge companion, please discuss ideas and related works below. (Also, please try to be charitable.)

  Like popular science fiction, New Age says "yes" where science says "no."

  The scientific method is all about disproving and diminishing, limiting possibility space rather than merely expanding it. Whenever research or theory *does* reveal a new understanding - electricity, magnetism, nutrition - 20th century New Age, like 19th century spiritualism before it, rushes to fill the gap with untested ideas.

  Then, armed only with a misunderstanding of meaning of evidence and the value of a double blind, it provides all the testing most people need.

  Science is a method for asking questions, but what most of us really want is answers. Positive, uplifting answers that tell us anything is possible. Not bummers like special relativity and thermodynamics.

  For some of us that's intragalactic empires, omnipresent nanomachines, and jigsaw box genetic engineering. For others it's crop circles, remote viewing, and life energy.

    There's a philosophical balance here that really throws me off. If we look back at history, we see a strong trend of people gaining capabilities previously thought impossible, through the advance of science. But we're expected to believe that now, the forces that say "arbitrary things we can't figure out how to do are impossible" are science and vice versa?

      Some people believe that witches can simply fly, and vampires, along with nuns and prophets. Science offers a relatively blunt "no" to all of this.

      That those same people can now, in limited situations, with the help of enormously expensive and complex engineering, strap themselves into an upholstered aluminum can and travel from San Francisco to Tokyo in mid-air is a relatively disappointing compromise.

      A modern, technological society can fly. *You* can't.

      Imagination is limitless. Scientific testing carves it away, peeling off smaller and smaller groups of options and leaving fewer and fewer places we can look for answers. When we search in those remaining corners, we sometimes find unexpected epiphanies that do indeed allow what was previously proclaimed impossible. Air pressure, high energy fuels, and global infrastructure make casual human flight possible.

      It's still a "yes, but..." rather than a "yes." Transcendental meditation promises that, with enough concentration, gravity will no longer tie you down. You, personally. No ticket or airport security required. There's just one problem: it's not true. Says who? Science.

        See, given the exponential rise of technology over, say, the twentieth century, I'm not sure why we should model knowledge as a tin that we've mostly already emptied and now we're scraping the bottom.  Instead knowledge seems more like a hyperbolic web, where every answer we find suggests several more answerable questions.  Sometimes we may find a dead end or loop back to someplace we've already explored, but that does not at all suggest that we've hit the final wall.

        "We can [x]" seems a lot easier to prove than "we can't [x]" to me.  "We can't [x] by [y]", sure.  But "we can't [x], period"?  The burden of proof is on a claim that "we can't [x]", too.  Let's say that we're in ancient Greece and you believe that man can't get to the moon.  What experiment do you propose to test that hypothesis?

          Aristarchus of Samos jumps into the air, notes that he returns to earth, and proposes the hypothesis validated. If he's feeling saucy he throws a rock or fires an arrow straight upwards.

          Positive results to negative hypotheses are the worst.  It would be more than a thousand years before Newton figures out that straight up is the single most difficult direction.

          Take today's announcement about gravity waves, or last year's evidence of a possible Higgs boson. Super boring and depressing! The former is another piece of evidence that general relativity is complete, the latter that the Standard Model is. Imagine somebody proves the Riemann hypothesis tomorrow by using conventional mathematics rather than by unraveling some secret pattern in the primes. Sure, she wins the Fields Medal and the Millennium Prize but what a profound disappointment for the rest of us.

          Wouldn't it be more fun if we'd looked in exactly the right place and gravity waves and Higgs bosons weren't there? Better yet, *something* was there that was provably *not* a gravity wave or a Higgs boson. Suddenly imagination can go wild again... within the relatively strict and simple boundaries our current understanding of physics allows.

          Scientific knowledge is *always* a tin that we've mostly emptied. It's just a tin of infinite size.

            And see, your experiment is flawed.  Not because we've gotten to the moon in real life.  The fact that we've gotten to the moon in real life merely *highlights* what's wrong with your experiment, which is that there are other imaginable means for reaching the moon, which are more likely to succeed than jumping, throwing a rock, or firing an arrow.

            In order to truly prove that an ends is impossible *by any means* - quite a different prospect from proving that the ends is impossible by a particular means - you must prove that the ends is in some sense a contradiction of terms.  This is why it is impossible for an omnipotent being to create a rock it cannot lift - because, given the definition of omnipotence, "a rock it cannot lift" cannot *exist*.

            To prove that the moon is not reachable - not the same thing as repeatedly failing to prove that the moon *is* reachable! - you would need to demonstrate that the moon isn't a *thing in the reachable class*.  For example, if approaching the moon caused it to apparently recede, so that the distance between yourself and the moon seems to remain a constant, this would suggest that the moon is not a conventional object at all, and would satisfyingly close the case of "can we reach the moon" for the "can't" side.  This is similar to what general relativity says about the speed of light - though many concepts have been proposed to subvert this limit, generally with some clever bending of space.

            A possibility requires some mechanism, and may be proven.  An impossibility also requires some mechanism, and may also be proven - but only by proving the mechanism, and not merely by repeatedly trying and failing to do the thing claimed to be impossible.

            So my plan to go straight down is feasible, is what you're saying? ;)

      We also see a strong trend of most people getting the future completely wrong. :)

      It's not that what they claim to do is impossible. It's just that they can't do it.

  Sometime next week I'm releasing the first chapter of a fanfic semi-relevant to this contest, though I won't be submitting it to this contest as it's only a beginning and not a complete story.
