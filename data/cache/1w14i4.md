## [BST][Spoilers] Rational!Frozen

### Post:

My gears have been turning ever since I saw the movie, but I haven't written everything down till now. This fic is extremely likely to crossover with Tangled, and IIRC there was a reference to Tangled within Frozen, so those movies fit together perfectly. Commence walls of text.

**WARNING: I AM ASSUMING YOU HAVE SEEN DISNEY'S FROZEN AND WILL SPOIL A GREAT MANY THINGS ABOUT THE MOVIE.**

_________

> *My power flurries through the air into the ground*

> *My soul is spiralling in frozen fractals all around*

> *And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast*

> *I'm never going back, the past is in the past*

**Part One: Power**

So anyway, Frozen gives one of the most exploitable powers ever to Elsa. Not only does the ice possess near-perfect interpretation of intent and incredible precision (from palaces to freaking fabric) but also enables intelligent drones which can be tailored to any purpose.

It is uncertain if the "ice" generated by this power is actually water or some sort of water analogue. It is uncertain if the water is potable, as pure H2O harmful to drink. A great deal of influence on existing water is generated, as when Elsa froze the entire water supply with a handful of footsteps.

The ice is certainly sturdy enough for building construction, and the precision of creating it can create simple mechanical devices, such as hinges.

I'm going to talk about the snowmen for a bit. We have two examples, Olaf, and an unnamed giant I'll call "Guardian."

Olaf gets the most screen time, so lets start with him. His creation is the most interesting aspect, as Elsa formed him off-hand, almost accidentally, and was surprised to discover he was intelligent and animated. Olaf is perfectly sentient, wide a significant range of emotions and installed education. I am uncertain to the degree of his senses, but he can speak, feel, see and hear perfectly well, despite lacking complex structures to do so. He is, aside from melting, functionally immortal, provided his is reassembled afterward. He quickly recovers from partial melting. There is no case of restoring a snowman which has completely melted and refrozen. 

It must also be noted that Olaf interacts with wooden limbs attached to him. ~~These stop animation if they are removed~~ [Disproved], but their shape does not revert.

The Guardian is significantly different. It is much larger, but its construction occurred almost as quickly as Olaf's despite the size difference. It too, is capable of speech, and adapted for combat with articulated fingers and reinforced joints. The Guardian demonstrares an ability to improve itself in battle (development of spikes after being shot by a crossbow, etc.), though it is uncertain if this is an instinctive response to injury or a conscious decision to escalate the conflict. The limits of these evolutions are uncertain. The Guardian's snow-based components were weak, but those problems are solvable.

Both of these creations must have been, considering Elsa's emotional state at the current time, totally unplanned. There is no known limit on the potential number of snowmen, or on their size or characteristics (a Serpent would be super cool, honestly).

Elsa's power is affected by her emotional state. The distinctions are fuzzy, but her control decreases as her ability to focus does, which is compounded by stress.

The last important note is that Elsa got her powers by birth, which means that there could easily be others with similar powers elsewhere in the world.

__________

**Part Two: Emotion**

Now that we've established a decent baseline, I want to bring something up.

What often happens in a Rationalist/Deconstructionist fanfiction of a "fairy tale" story is that things like the magical power of true love get broken down or shown to be false, with some other alternative presented.

Why?

Why can't love have magic powers? Like actual, true power sourced from love. Why can't emotions have tangible physical effects in a world where magic has tangible physical effects?

The problems with those fairy tale is that "True Love" as a narrative device has tended towards unsatisfactory/inconsistent conflict resolution. I propose that this is a failure of the storyteller and not the narrative device itself. I want to see a story where True Love, just like everything else in a Rational story, is taken seriously, with all of the logical implications of a world where such forces exist. To the logical extremes!

Thusly, "Love" is a global magical effect which distributes along relationships between sentient beings. It does not directly cause these relationships to form, but will have certain influences as they do. Variances will occur between two kids who have been in love for an hour and two adults who've been together for fifty years. This will definitely be the trickiest part to design. 

_________

**Part Three: Story**

There are exactly two things I would like to change about Frozen: replace those silly trolls with the original ice gatherers from the prologue, with a single shaman to provide the magical elements (it's actually better that way, giving at least one other case of a human being born with magic) and I would change the ending. Slightly.

Anna succumbs to the ice and freezes. Her forzen hand blocks Han's sword, KOing him and saving Elsa's life. This act of sacrifical love thaws Elsa's heart, disabling her magic and changing her hair color back to the darker color her mother had. This (Elsa's power block) in combination with Anna's own Sacrifice saves Anna's life, returning her to normal. The ice holding up Anna, Elsa and Hans breaks down, but Christoff and Sven save the girls from drowning. Olaf melts as Arrendale normalizes, unfortunately.

This reselling would form the first chapter, leaving the fic as such: 

* Arrendale is in chaos from the catastrophic snowstorms, the summer crop of the entire region has been obliterated and the death counts are just coming in...

* The Duke of ~~Weaseltown~~ Wesselton is readying to manipulate trade systems and relief efforts for the stricken kingdom...

* The Southern Isles are threatening retaliation for political reasons (Han's death is just an excuse for his older brothers to make a power grab)...

* There's probably a rebellion of magic-haters brewing somewhere, possibly with aid from the Duke...

* The Winter has attracted the attention of at least two extremely dangerous magic users from abroad (still deciding what they would be)...

* Anna and Elsa have been reunited after a childhood of seperation and memory abuse, and must now catch up while leading the kingdom through a combination of crises.

> *'Cause for the first time in forever,* 

> *I finally understand*

> *For the first time in forever,*

> *We can fix this hand in hand*

__________

And that's what I have so far. Comment if you have anything to add or if I made a mistake. And now that I think about it, this would probably start to spiral out into deconstructing most of the Disney versions of fairy tales, although I expect that has been tried before. Does anyone know of anything like that?

  Great idea! I have a compulsive desire to rewrite every movie I watch, and *Frozen* is definitely rife with possibilities for rationality.

  Ooh, a deconstructionist fic. I really like your ideas thus far. Are you planning on setting it in the same universe as *Tangled*? Just because that would be kinda cool.

  Anyway, looking forward to reading it. If there are already deconstructionist Disneyfics, then I've not seen them; you'd be the first! Awesome!

  In case you were wondering, btw, the giant guardian snowman is named Snowflake.

    Frozen is a prime candidate for exploring rationality. It has interesting characters, exploitable powers, an implied wider world around it...

    And it's overlap with Tangled is canon. Rapunzel and Eugene were at the coronation.

    > In case you were wondering, btw, the giant guardian snowman is named Snowflake.

    I thought it was Marshmellow. A leaflet in a Kinder Egg told me.

        Rise of the Guardians would be very tricky to fit in, since it shows a modern setting, but *damn* if I wouldn't love to see an AU Jack meet Elsa.

          I've actually been playing around with a rational!Guardians AU where it's set in the late 900s or thereabouts. Just cos. Probably just a one-shot, but I definitely left room to expand ...

    It's not an outright deconstruction, unless taking something seriously is the only requirement to calling something a deconstruction.

      ```
      Taking for-granted story elements to their realistic conclusions, which were ignored in the original fic? Yeah, sounds like a deconstruction.

  This is very interesting and I like the idea of love as an quantifiable effect and further exploration in snow based AI. The main problem I have with the idea is how Elsa's power is disabled. 
  >This act of sacrificial love thaws Elsa's heart, disabling her magic

  It is clearly stated in the movie that it is a gift rather than a curse and that the only reason why the power is a bad thing is that Elsa fears and fights it. I understand if you want to remove the power "at least temporarily" for story purposes but in that case it should be a mental block due to the trauma rather than a "curse lifted" scenario. It also doesn't fit with the fact that Elsa's heart "froze" due to isolation, trauma and stress and it was quite "thawed" when the sisters were children even though she had her magic then.

  Another idea is that the snow golems could have some kind of core made of ice and magic that works as a heart and brain for them. This would also be easy to work in with the power of love as well as give a way for Elsa to still use some of her power. Perhaps Olafs or the guardians core is recovered and because it's fused with some of her power she can use it in some way. 

  Anyway, I hope some of my ideas helped and I look forward to reading the story once you start putting it out there.

  I liked how rationally they treated the Power of Love in the movie, actually. Once they found out that's what Anna needed, it was all like, "Get me to the man with the kissing powers!" as if the Power of Love is just another element in their world like penicillin is in ours. Expanding on that would be really interesting.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Well thank god that's not how they actually did it; that would've been so cheesy and antifeminist I'd've died. The sisterly love thing was much much better.
    ```

- u/None:
  ```
  God dammit, I'm already writing this. I want to change a bunch of things, most notably Hans turning out to be a villain (as much as it makes the "Love is an Open Door" song delightful to relisten to. "We finish all of each other's--" "Sandwiches!" "That's what I was going to say!" No you weren't.), and address the question of just what the hell were Elsa and Anna doing for ~ten years locked up in a castle and not talking to each other. I also want to put in a lot of the missing elements from the original story the movie is every so loosely based off of. Especially the witch and her flowers and the thief girl with the knife.

  Then there's the question of what happens after the movie ending. Elsa's military power is ridiculous, and the other countries would notice. I'd also like for the sisters to learn a Very Important Lesson about why it's a bad idea to cut off trade with another country just because their duke is a jerk.

  And of course there's the question of where Elsa's power comes from, which bothered me the whole movie. If they had just said, "An ice fairy blessed her" one minute in it would have been fine, but they don't explain at all.

  Anyone else think the movie was overrated? It was good but not great. The songs were fun but forgettable. Elsa was the main character and needed more screen time and more focus on her arc. This is not yet the second Disney renaissance that some people are calling it. Also, the faces for their female leads really bother me. The faces are too wide and the noses too small and pushed down. And the clumpy hair makes me feel ill for some reason.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Since you're both coming at this from a completely different direction, I think there's room for more than one rational exploration of Frozen. And I approve of changing Hans to not be a villain. It really bothered me that the most competent person was the bad guy. 

    > Anyone else think the movie was overrated? It was good but not great.

    It was pretty great, actually but just like every other Disney movie, you can't overthink it too much. Otherwise Aladin becomes a bad movie :-) The animation was amazing, the songs were fun (especially "Do You Want to Build a Snowman" and "Let it Go") and the characters were rather fun. And amazingly Olaf wasn't completely annoying. 

    The movie did have flaws, but so has nearly every movie. But during my first time watching it, I was emotionally engaged (even tearing up a little), I laughed, I gasped, I was amazed by the cool ice powers... And the story being about sisterly love is another plus. 

    I guess it depends on how you rate a movie. For me, a movie (or any story, really) is good if I'm emotionally engaged and don't spend too much time questioning it *while* watching it.

  (Slightly off topic) Umm, why do you think pure water is harmful to drink? All I can find on a quick google is that you may need to supplement your mineral supply and that some reverse osmosis units can get (slightly) harmful bacterial growths.

  I can't think of any reasons why pure H2O would be worse than almost pure H2O, apart from the mentioned lack of trace minerals which could be made up by dietary supplements.
  ```

  - u/AmeteurOpinions:
    ```
    Eh, that's what I was talking about. It was more to prevent the point of Elsa making free water for the world forever.
    ```

    - u/Malician:
      ```
      Do you think that whether the water is potable or not makes a significant difference to the effect of the power?
      ```

- u/syberdragon:
  ```
  I recall them stating several times in the film that Elsa was cursed by a witch to have her powers, or something to that affect. I could be wrong or forgetting the context of the statement.
  ```

  - u/AmeteurOpinions:
    ```
    Nope. One of the earliest lines in the film is the chief troll asking just before he cures Anna the first time, "Born or cursed?" to which the father says "Born. And getting stronger." Elsa was certainly born that way.
    ```

- u/Suitov:
  ```
  Would you mind expanding on your rationale for Elsa being refrigeratored? It leaves a sour taste with me, removing her powers (that she was born with) for no reason I can see.

  Please do leave Hans as a gold-digging villain, too, because it contributes to the loveliest deconstruction of the "twoo wuv at first sight" trope I've ever seen on film.
