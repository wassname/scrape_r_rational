  There doesn't appear, to my knowledge, to be a fully solid proof of the problem of induction; that being said, pretty much everyone accepts it as axiomatic at some level (For a detailed proof of this, place your hand on a hot stove. After treating the burns, do it again. There's no *real* reason to think it'll hurt again, right?)

  Once you have a somewhat hacked-together proof of empiricism, causality comes the same way.
