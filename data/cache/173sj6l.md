  Welcome to my fantasy omnibus post, as promised in last week's recommendation thread. Below I recommend fantasy series that I think this sub would be interested in. I won't be recommending the most obvious series (Game of Thrones, Harry Potter, LotR) because you have access to the internet and already know what those are.

  This is a long one, and I only got through half the list I compiled at the beginning. If people get something out of this, I'll make another. There's no particular order here, enjoy the chaos.

  [Dresden Files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dresden_Files) by Jim Butcher

  Urban fantasy done well in a long-running series with a slow start. Harry Dresden is a wizard detective in Chicago, and in each novel has to deal with a magical menace or menaces threatening his city with the help of a large cast of supporting characters. The books are relatively short and tightly-plotted, and are structured more like crime books than fantasy novels. The first two books are famously poor relative to the rest of the series, and the third book is only slightly better. Unfortunately, I think it's best to slog through the poor first books, it's not a series that rewards skipping.

  Setting aside the weakness of the first three books (and perhaps one other much later in the series), the Dresden Files has a lot to recommend. The characters are memorable and change a great deal over time (the series thus far spans significant time in-world). Dresden typically needs to pull together all of his resources to squeak through difficult situations, which can be entertaining, though some find how close his calls are to be contrived. Dresden gets significantly stronger over the course of the series, and it's done in a slow-burn way that's quite satisfying.

  Dresden turns some (many?) off as a character because he is initially chauvinistic in an old-timey "I'm chivalrous" sense. This element gets toned down a lot over the course of the series.

   If you wind up liking, or already like, Dresden Files, I recommend going back and reading the Spenser series by [Robert B. Parker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_B._Parker), which is a crime series that Butcher liberally copied from in tone, plotting, pacing, and characterization.

  [His Dark Materials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/His_Dark_Materials) by Philip Pullman

  A series of three nominally young adult novels set in a world where one's soul is externalized as a daemon, basically an animal familiar. These are excellently written novels that explore in depth a specific set of philosophical ideas. The central question is: what if souls were empirically real and could be manipulated? If I have a gripe with YA novels, it's that characters bumble from one situation to another with little agency. This really isn't the case hereâ€”Lyra, the protagonist, is socially adept and a natural , if somewhat situational, manipulator.

  The really good parts of this series are mostly spoilers, but the world has fascinating metaphysics and opens up as the books go on. If you've seen the movie, forget it, as it will put you off. I think people on this sub would really dig these for the worldbuilding, metaphysics, and writing. 

  [The Prince of Nothing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_of_Nothing) by R. Scott Bakker

  This three-novel series is actually written by a philosophy professor. PoN is challenging on a number of levels. The prose is dense, the backstory and worldbuilding are not spoonfed to you, and the characters are put through a pretty heinous psychological wringer. I actually don't want to understate this, this series is not for the weak of stomach.

  The surface-level question asked here is: what would happen if a supergenious hypermanipulator showed up in the middle of the Crusades? The deeper question asked here is: what would happen if the nature of the afterlife was determined by a consensus of the beliefs of the majority of sapients on the planet?

  You should try this novel for the cool magic, which is based around ancient Greek philosophical ideas. For example, the magical schools are based around gnosis (abstraction), analogy (poetry), and pseuke (emotion). The antagonists are probably the most disturbing /terrifying of any series, and are extraordinarily well thought out. Though the initial protagonist (the superintelligent hypermanipulator) starts to take a backseat as the series goes on, he's an incredible POV, and seeing a science-oriented omegacompetent character hit this fantasy world like a disaster is pretty entertaining.

  Truly excellent books, but not a beach read. Unless it'sa beach run by evil elves working for even more evil intergalactic bioengineers, and the guy getting a tan is the product of 2,500 years of eugenics, and the cabana boy is called the No-God.


  [Chronicles of Amber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chronicles_of_Amber) by Roger Zelazny

  Roger Zelazny has the dubious distinction of being the fantasy author who always comes last on lists of fantasy authors. However, he doesn't come last in terms of quality. See what I did there? *shoots self in head*

  Sorry, I let my little brother write that first paragraph...

  This one totally is a beach read. Chronicles of Amber is a series of short, breezy books set in a cosmos where a single family of siblings wars across endless parallel universes. Reality, apparently, works on a gradient, with some places being more real and some less, and Amber is the city on the more-real side of that gradient. The sibs all want control of this kick-ass city/reality combo.

  I recommend this series for the cool premise and the more-or-less nonstop engaging situations and action. The characters are a little 2D but still oddly memorable. Zelazny, as an author, was a great writer with a big purple streak, but he reined himself in a bit for this one, and you mostly get spare prose here. Personally, I like reading novels from other periods because the past is a foreign land and all that, and I love the weird '70s vibe here. 

  This is a ten-book series, but treat it as a five-book series with a bonus. The first five books are their own series, and then the second set of five books is basically a fanfiction of the first series written by the same author with a Gary Stu protagonist. I also kind of enjoyed those books, but they're objectively much worse than the first five, so just be prepared for that if you're really digging the first five. 

  There's also a weird RPG based on this series that people still go gaga for because it has really different rules from other RPGs, eschewing dice altogether and using a whacky but cool auction system for character creation. If you like reading RPG books I recommend taking a look at [Amber Diceless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amber_Diceless_Roleplaying_Game).

  [The Malazan Book of the Fallen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malazan_Book_of_the_Fallen) by Steven Erikson

  This long-ass series of doorstops was written by an anthropologist. They're a wild kitchen sink of awesome fantasy nonsense and worldbuilding. One of the coolest things about this series is that it spans hundreds of thousands of years. There are lots of pretty out-there fantasy races, and they all have endless backstory. X race are a long-lived group of tusked, medium-sized giants who like to sit in peaceful, solitary contemplation in their own individual towers, except that 1 in 10,000 of them are bloodthursty tyrants who want to take over the world. Y race started an ice age and turned themselves undead to survive it 50,0000 years ago because one of those tyrants was pissing them off. There are buster-sword wielding dusk elves with cool names like Anomander Rake flying around on artificial moons built by mechanically-inclined sword-armed insects who have since died out. The buster sword of that guy, Anomander Rake, has a universe inside it, and when he cuts people, they get pulled by chains into that universe and yoked to a giant cart. That giant cart is perpetually running from a rulling apocalypse, and it's implied that the world Rake is in is sitting on that cart, so he has to keep the sword topped up or the whole cosmogony will collapse. There's a guy who serves as an advisor for one random army in one conflict on one Continent in one world in the series, and that guy is like 75,000 years old and cursed to live forever by the gods that the current gods worshipped as gods back in the day, and they destroyed his continent while they were at it, and that dead continent/world is used as a shortcut by wizards now and just has piles of bone ash lying around. The whole series is recursively bonkers like this. 

  I recommend starting with Deadhouse Gates, the second book in the series. Nothing is ever explicitly explained in this series, you have to figure out the whole history and magic system from context clues (or read the wiki, I guess) and the first book has like .5 crossover characters and is set on a different continent from book 1, so you won't miss anything. Just let things wash over you and you'll put things together as the series goes on, enjoy the craziness.


  I wrote [a post on the magic system](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/84iybe/confusion_on_gardens_of_the_moon/dvq6meq/) and how nothing is much explained in Malazan awhile back.
  ```

    My fantasy omnibus post...*continued*! Who knew that Reddit posts had to be less than 10,000 characters? Everyone? OK, moving on.

    [Earthsea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthsea) by Ursula K. Le Guin

    A series as minimalist as Malazan is maximalist. These books are set on a low fantasy archipelago and follow a wizard named Ged as he deals with problems that don't generally involve destroying the whole cosmos. The prose is spare and beautiful, the books are short, and the atmosphere is memorable. 

    Le Guin returned to this series much later with an explicitly feminist approach, and while those books are still pretty decent, they're not really classics in the same way.

    By the way, if you haven't read [The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas](https://files.libcom.org/files/ursula-k-le-guin-the-ones-who-walk-away-from-omelas.pdf), just stop what you're doing and read it right now. It's a thought exercise written in beautiful proseâ€”"With a clamor of bells that set the swallows soaring, the Festival of Summer came to the city Omelas, bright-towered by the sea"â€”and is required reading for all sapients.

    [Tigana] by Guy Gavriel Kay

    What if a wizard cast a spell that made a country forget it's name? This is classic, well-executed high fantasy with wizards, kings, crafty woodsmen, etc. and is basically just a great yarn. Kay is a great up-and-down fantasy writer. I don't need to write ten paragraphs about everything, just read it.

    [The Magicians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magicians_%28Grossman_novel%29) by Lev Grossman

    This is a criticism of the ennui of modern life taking the form of a fun, well-executed fantasy novel. Quentin is a smart kid who always wanted to live in a fantasy world, but instead lives in the real world where he has no school-life balance and his parents think he's meh. When he gets the chance to go to magic school (off brand Harry Potter but deftly executed and fun to read), he finds that, hey, wherever you go, there you are, and he's still a big ball of modern problems and psychological issues. Then he gets the chance to escape into, you guessed it, an even more escapist fantasy world, and that's when the shit really hits the fan.

    This book is perhaps also not for the faint of heart, it can be hard to read about characters with such a wealth of opportunity but with such deep-seated and, let's be honest, pretty realistic psychological issues. That said, the fantasy here is still a lot of fun, and I do think the book has something to say about modern life, escapism, and relationships. As someone who grew up reading HP and Narnia, it hits pretty close to home for me. It's also well-written in that literary fiction sort of way. There are sequels that are equally good and also devastating in their own fashion, which is somewhat surprising to me.

    [Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Strange_%26_Mr_Norrell) Susanna Clarke

    This truly yonking doorstop took up my entire backpack when I read it in 2004. (Yes, I'm old and have since gone blind, so I can now only use my copy of JS&MN as ballast or to test small-arms penetration on a firing range.) 

    Magic is a thing, but everyone knows there hasn't been magic in Britain for a long time. This changes just as that fellow Bonaparte starts making trouble on the continent. Two (very) British wizards with quite different personalities reintroduce magic to Britannia and get involved with the war effort. Read if you love footnotes that take up entire pages in tiny type in your fantasy novel.

    This book is something of an odd duck, but if you're even somewhat into history or like to go deep, I recommend it. You might want to rent a wheelbarrow to carry it around, though.

    [Kingkiller Chronicles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kingkiller_Chronicle) by whats-his-face-with-the-beard (Patrick Rothfuss)

    On paper, these novels should be bad. First, the protagonist is a Gary Stu and good at everything. Second, the plot never goes anywhere. Third, there's a framing element, so things go back and forth between the story and, like, telling the story in an inn. Fourth, the author has no intention of ever finishing. Fifth, the author spends his time ostentatiously swanning around the internet playing CCGs, not writing, and telling people off for wanting a conclusion to the series. Sixth, the protagonist is a ginger.

    Despite this long set of show-stopping impedimentia, I still recommend reading these. Why? Because the author used some weird beta-testing system to make every scene and paragraph smoothly flow from one to another. This creates a hypnotic effect where the books are bizarrely readable and you don't even notice that the plot never moves, the MC is a PITA, and the author has a stupid beard. Crack this book and be swept along, fully engaged. Only after finishing it will you say, hey, what was the deal with that framing narrative?

    What are these books about? Something something MC is a bard, something something magic school, something something framing narrative, something something sex with queen of the faeries. Fun magic system.

    [The First Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_First_Law) by Joe Abercrombie

    You know whose beard is not stupid? Joe Abercrombie's. This guy is a mensch who pumps out long, but non-doorstopping, low fantasy novels with tight plots, great character arcs, and fun reversals. All his books are set in the same universe, which starts out high fantasy-ish and becomes more low fantasy as the series progresses and, presumably, magic leaks out of the world or whatever.

    Abercrombie has some specialties. He starts out characters a certain way, and by the end they've come so far as to be unrecognizable, but in a sort of incremental way that is organic and natural. Certain characters are, frankly, epic, and the way he will have some really cool character from another novel show up in others, often in unexpected ways, is a lot of fun. He writes amazing fight / action scenes and excels at guiding situations toward complete but lovingly-described bedlam. He may be my favorite extant fantasy novelist.

    While starting with The First Law is the natural entry point, I actually recommend starting with a standalone book, Best Served Cold. It's a multistage revenge heist with an awesome (and scary) female protagonist and a whacky group of supporting assassins. Oh, and one other thing about Abercrombieâ€”he sticks his landings. Good to the last drop.

    * * *

    *Fin*...or is it? I still have a lot of novels in this here markdown file. Let me know if you'd like me to do another of these to clear the rest.

    - u/Escapement:
      ```
      This is a pretty good list. Thanks for doing it! Even though I've read literally everything on this list it's still helpful for newer readers, and my takes on the books you mention are mostly pretty similar, so I'd be happy to see more in this vein.

      ---

      On the topic of Zelazny: Lord of Light is an amazing standalone novel. It's not very long, and also extremely well written - I love the prose in it. It's a harder read than the Amber books, but well worth the effort. I've read everything by Zelazny, and Lord of Light was my favourite. 

      If you really like Zelazny's Amber, also check out Steven Brust's Vlad Taltos / Dragaera books - Brust was very stylistically influenced by Zelazny, and uses that sort of style better than most others. The plot centers around Vladimir Taltos, a human assassin in a largely elf-dominated high fantasy empire with abundant teleportation, resurrection, and the like, who's first adventure is a sort of entertaining reverse detective story - instead of trying to solve a murder, he's trying to work out how to commit one.

      I recommend the order of publication for Taltos books, but the exact order matter less in his works, because they each tend to be a complete story, with a setup, escalation, and conclusion in each novel. They all center around Vlad but are less interdependent than a lot of series. As the series progresses, Brust experiments a fair bit with form, style, themes, and other elements - one book is told with extended flashbacks from a framing narrative in the novel's present day, another is told from a secondary character's viewpoint, and so on.
      ```

      - u/AviusAedifex:
        ```
        > Steven Brust's Vlad Taltos 

        I'd recommend skipping the third book Teckla. It completely killed any interest I had in the series despite really enjoying the first two. Maybe I'll get around to reading the rest of the series, but that book is easily one of the worst things I've ever read, and I've read a lot of garbage. It's even worse because of how good the first two were.
        ```

        - u/Empiricist_or_not:
          ```
          I disagree with you on overall quality but it is a low,but  Tekla was written in the wake of Burst' divorce and the death of a friend by carbomb.  Tekla sets up a lot of the Moral evolution of Vlad and its either here or in Phoenix (where a lot more moral decisions become necessary) that Verra first points towards the reason for the midevil stasis, which IMHO is well developed world building. There's a lot of foreshadowing over the arc of the books that are paid off with organic character development as  you see the power escalation to someone Sethra calls a friend and peer.

            ```
            >!I understand the context, but it changes nothing for me. If I knew the book was him whining about his divorce for 200 pages I would've just skipped the series all together. This is the kind of plotline I wouldn't read if I was paid or my life dependent on it, and the fact that the author included it instead of either venting privately or going to a therapist or whatever has completely killed my interest in his work. I think it's really disrespectful to the reader to include stuff like and then do it so badly. If I wanted to listen to this shit, I'd go talk with my parents. I have a very intense personal dislike of stuff like this, and it's one thing if you do it well and manage to cover it, but this is done incredibly badly. The rest of the plotline with the class struggle is kind of interesting, but ultimately incredibly underwhelming.!<

        I'm more of a *This Immortal* guy (probably my favorite Zelazny novel). I also like *Doorways in the Sand*. Brust was on my extended list, good recommendation, they have a lot of eastern European flavor despite being fantasy novels.

        I'm also in the boat of having (more or less) read all the fantasy novels. I've been working my way through this list, as there are some lesser known but decent books on there. (Some are justifiably forgotten, however.)

        Though I quite liked *Lord of Light*.

        I have read Brustâ€™s *To Reign in Hell*, which made me quite confident that Scott had read it before writing *Unsong*. While I want to read Talros, my trawling of used bookstores has yet to turn up anything before the fourth book or so.

      >The Magicians by Lev Grossman

      While I think this is a pretty solid collection of recommendations, I'm going to strongly anti-recommend this one.

      When I read the first book, I actually liked it. At the time, I was very depressed (I still am, if less so, but I was too!), and the MC, Quentin, resonated with me as a character who felt like they'd been handed everything they ever wanted, only for the pall of their depression to turn it muddy and grey.

      Unfortunately, on a re-read, and then progression to the later books, I found that I could barely stand them.

      The plot doesn't go anywhere, the author seems to think that a good deconstruction of !Narnia involves nothing much ever happening, the main character remaining a mopey shithead who has little to no character development (while I at one point certainly empathized with that, I do my best to tug on my own bootstraps, hoping conservation of momentum took this as it's day off), behaves suboptimally throughout, the side characters aren't particularly more interesting either.

      My memory is hazy, but I came away from the last book with a strong feeling my time had been wasted. I don't recall the prose being more than serviceable either, and the exploration of !Hogwarts but with (more) demons waiting to eat you wasn't particularly interesting either.

      The reader would be better served looking elsewhere, and Quentin with a course of antidepressants, followed by electroconvulsive therapy.

      I would draw a similarity to the worst parts of Evangelion, once again with a depressed protagonist moping around, but extended to multiple novels.

      For a very tangentially related suggestion, perhaps The Laundry Files by Charles Stross:

      It's a setting close to the present, where the Lovecraftian Mythos, while inaccurate, is a better guide to reality than not. Sufficiently complex algorithms, in brains or in-silico, reach out between worlds to draw the attention of things you'd rather never hear of you.

      Mathematicians come down with dementia, because in the process of solving hard topological problems in their head, their neurons end up emulating a *summoning circle* for micro-demons that then happily munch on them.

      Magic is Computational Thaumaturgy, the nerdy protagonist well out of his depth, it's wildly funny, without losing the potential for poignancy where it counts.

      9/10 would rec, 8/10 after newer protagonists take over.
      ```

      - u/Empiricist_or_not:
        ```
        Seconding your laundry files rec because the dark humor of putting a hacker in a bueracracy trying to be a spy and succeding at it as a necromancer does a lot, and the way Stross riffs a notable lierary style each hook makes sure it doesnt get stuck in a rut.  Also author cstross is fairly active on reddit, so you can get questions anwsered, and also the author of a few notable sci-fi titles (accelerando and glasshouse) to name my personal favorites.

        I think you might be a little close to the material, which is understandable. I also found some parts of *The Magicians* to be a difficult read.

        While it's a fantasy novel in a technical sense, it's really more of a literary fiction novel with a fantasy setting. The emphasis on interpersonal dysfunction and relationship issues is more a literary fiction thing, something like *Normal People*.

        I think there are, of course, going to be novels with depressed characters, but sometimes you're not in a good state of mind to read that kind of thing. If all novels had protagonists pulling themselves up by their bootstraps all the time, that would be a bore, even though I probably prefer those novels in general. Personally, I think the writing is really good, that's the only thing I'd firmly disagree with you on.

        I agree that that's a crummy blurb, but "millennial relationship dysfunction and alcoholism at Hogwarts" probably wouldn't sell.

          I would suggest the inverse, that I was close at the start, liking the protagonist in the initial novel, but time and distance made the glaring flaws more obvious. I'd say my opinion is less colored by my own experiences now, and I think I'd have said I disliked it even if I'd read the other two at the time.

          I'm also not really 100% aboard calling it a literary novel, not that we can't civilly disagree, it's hardly a protected characteristic. I don't think the writing was anything to, well, write home about.

          It's entirely possible to make readers care about damaged, self-destructive and casually malevolent characters with no insight into themselves. It just needs a lot of work, which I don't think this novel managed. 

          >I agree that that's a crummy blurb, but "millennial relationship dysfunction and alcoholism at Hogwarts" probably wouldn't sell.

          Probably, and maybe because there's probably no end of fan-fics with a similar premise haha.

          Anyway, I appreciate the recommendations myself!

            I'm not calling it literature, just lit fic. It's a genre that is sometimes not acknowledged as a genre, usually with a focus on relationships and modern situations like divorce, infidelity, etc. Traditionally defined in Opposition to genre fiction but those distinctions are starting to break down. (I'm more or less just saying that I wasn't complimenting the book when I call it literary fiction, just observing that it quacks like that particular duck, and that Quentin would be about median depressing for a literary fiction protagonist.)

            Appreciate it. I was just looking for a distraction yesterday so decided to write all this, I'm going to have my first kid in the coming weeks and my head is all over the place.

      And now I am trying to come up with other good fantasy.. and most of what I can think of is "Science Fiction in drag".

        Yeah, Penric is on the extended list. The other items were Wheel of Time, Black Company, Prince of Thorns, and a couple standalone books. These are somewhat more qualified recommendations, though. Penric is really solid, but it's one of those series I never feel the need to move on to the next book, I just read one every year or so even though they're so short. But I'm usually pretty happy with them.

        There's a lot more good sci-fi than good fantasy out there. I'm reading Glory Road by Heinlein right now, which is sci-fi with some fantasy faffing around.  The Temporal Void series is also sci-fi with some good fantasy nonsense thrown in. (Seems like fantasy + sci-fi = psychics a lot of the time, space marines are always psychic.)

          We're told that Haliax is cursed by his name, that there's an art similar to Naming known as Shaping, that the Chandrian are killing those who tell their true story and having Denna spread stories in which they're the good guys, that people can change the Names that determine who they are somehow, that Kote is a different man than Kvothe, that Bast wants Chronicler to bring Kvothe back by hearing his story, and that people "build themselves out of stories".

          More specifically, there's a tension in the story between all good stories being false and all the truth in the world existing in stories. This mirrors the dual belief required for sympathy to effect change on the world. Interestingly, that kind of dual belief is also how predictive processing folks claim the brain causes the body to move.

      > The Magicians by Lev Grossman

      I don't know anything about the book series. Have you seen the TV series? What did you think of it?

      I've watched season 1 and much of season 2 quite a while ago. While it was somewhat entertaining, I didn't make any effort to see the later seasons.

        The later seasons diverged more and more from the books, but I think they generally took it in a good direction that felt less depressing than the books and better than the first couple of seasons.

        I don't watch a lot of TV, so I don't know how it stacks up. It's a cliche, but generally screen adaptations aren't as good as the source material, with some notable exceptions. I'd give it a whirl if you like at least the premise.

  I would like to once again recommend [An Undertow of Sand](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/an-undertow-of-sand-percy-jackson-and-the-cthulhu-mythos.941042/) by Shujin, which has updated just a few days ago.

  It is a Percy Jackson/Cthulhu Mytho's fusion (with some sprinkles of Bloodborne as well). It is probably my favorite crossover fic, it is extremely well written and Shujin actually make a lot of research into mythology to both make the fusion more consistent and also to smooth out inconsistencies between real -life mythology and PJO canon.

  The basic premisse of the fic is that the Great Old Ones and Outer Gods of the Cthulhu Mythos are one and the same with the protegenoi and primordial gods of real-life mythology, and that the names of these beings in the Cthulhu Mythos are just names that Lovecraft came up with, they are names without any real *power*, but that the same *cannot* be said about the names of historical mythology.

  So, if you were you were to make an offering to "Shub-Niggurath", the Mother of a Thousand Young wouldn't even be close to noticing it, but if you made an offering to Nyx, it *might*. No one would respond for a prayer for *Cthulhu*, but the the slumbering god in the sea might respond to a call to *Pontus*.

  And within this context, we are faced with the prophecy of cannon PJO, and Shujin herself really put it best:

  >"'A half-blood child of the eldest gods, shall reach sixteen against all odds.' Who decided the sons of Kronos met the criteria for eldest gods? There are older gods. Elder Gods. And They have been watching. See with your mind, oh Child of Prophecy. For reality is a lie. Your very existence is a flaw. An anomaly. A bend in Fate. And if Fate can bend, then it can break. Everything is different. Nothing has changed.

   Percy Jackson, son of Sally Jackson and Poseidon, does not exist. Instead, we follow Percy Steele, son of Dorian Steele (a lawyer in New York) and the god the Greeks knew as Ananke, the goddess of compusion, inevitability, necessity, and *fate*. Yet, 'Ananke' is not the only name of this being: The Celtics knew her as The MÃ³rrÃ­gan, the Phanton Queen. The Egyptians knew it by another name still, and came to consider its worship heretical: Horemheb tried to erase historical records of the pharaoh who adopted it; and by the time Ramesses II was in power, the period of this pharaoh's rein was described as "the time of the enemy".

  And a peculiar man from Providence, who wrote wonderous and fantastical tales rooted on the vistas and visions he had in his dreams, described it as an evilly intelligent messenger of hidden and terrible powers.
  ```

  - u/lillarty:
    ```
    I tried reading this when it was recommended a while ago, but couldn't really get into it. I barely know Percy Jackson at all so maybe in-depth knowledge of the series is just needed to appreciate it, or maybe it just gets great later and the beginning doesn't fit, but either way I bounced off it. 

    Your own description hints at one of the reasons I wasn't a fan: the Lovecraftian bits are meaningless. A lot of fans of Lovecraft are less into the specific details and more about the atmosphere he weaves. On a slight tangent, this is why so many game adaptations of his works fail; they adhere to a surface-level details but ruin atmosphere. With this story, up until where I read (\~10% of the story), it has neither the atmosphere nor the specific details. Lovecraftian gods are substituted for historical historical mythology, and Lovecraftian atmosphere is substituted for Percy Jackson atmosphere. At that point it's just... a weird Percy Jackson AU?

  Wildbow just posted the last chapter and a retrospective on [Pale](https://palewebserial.wordpress.com/about/), his latest and largest story. It's Urban Fantasy, set in the same world as Pact, but doesn't require knowledge of that to understand. I'd even argue it's easier to learn about the world through Pale than Pact. 

  As for the plot, three teenagers in a small Canadian town are brought into the knowledge of magic, to investigate a murder of a supernatural being. The story grows a lot from there, but never loses sight of this inciting incident the way other WB stories do. Untypically, it's not told in first person, but switches between the three main characters in 3rd. I'd say it's my favourite story by Wildbow yet, but that might be recency bias talking. I'll have to see how I feel about it in half a year.

  As for future stories, he said he'll take it slow for a while, posting essays on writing and then taking a holiday - the first one he's had since starting Worm in 2011, one might add. Then it's on to a Sci-Fi story that I'm very excited about, and he's teased us with further Otherverse stories. I wish him all the best and recommend his stories to everyone here. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask me.

          So I think the character work is on par with Twig, plot and worldbuilding on worms level or better.   The fights go from decent to excellent.  Pacing is far better than Ward or Pact.  I think the only thing I dislike is that the first 4 arcs feel a little slow and disjointed, itâ€™s hard to tell the three POVs apart right away, and sometimes you have to quickly pick up on something the MCs learned off screen.

          Overall I think it uses what WB does best (highly realized characters, cool worldbuilding, clever conflict resolution) and improved on some of his worse traits (better pacing and lgbt+ rep).

                  Judging by conversations I've seen on /r/parahumans, some people object to LGBTQ people being portrayed as villains regardless of the fact that there are other positive portrayals of LGBTQ people in the story and regardless of the fact that cis-het villains are more common in the story. Some people just want to see only positive portrayals of LGBTQ characters and don't care about how that would flatten the wide variety of LGBTQ experiences and personalities that exist in reality.

                    This is a reaction. For decades on end, the only queer people in media were invariably villains. This makes it really hard to write a queer villain that does not invoke some rather.. unfortunate.. tropes.

                      Right. I see it as  similar to how the portrayal of black people has changed in literature and cinema over time. Back in the bad old days southern propaganda tended to feature extremely negative, racist stereotypes, particularly the [stereotype of black men being sexual predators towards white women](https://jimcrowmuseum.ferris.edu/brute/homepage.htm). That extreme racist portrayal still lingers in people's memories, so these days content creators tend to avoid depicting that scenario in their works.

      Rating things, comparing them against each other, is kinda hard for me. When I make "listings" of things, I often find that even when A > B, and B > C, that doesn't automatically mean A > C.

      Worm was my first Wildbow story that I read, and I loved it a lot. I could binge it, which feels very different from following along live.  
      Pact got better during a second readthrough; on my first, I didn't feel like I understood the world much or at all. On a second read, that feeling went away and I could see how it all fit together.   
      Twig really held my interest captive, Sylvester as a main character was such a fun and new lens to see the world through.  
      When I read Ward, it was the first Wildbow story I could follow along from start to finish. Being immersed in the community probably made me enjoy it more than I would have if I'd read it all at once after it was finished. When it ended, it was my favourite story, but maybe in retrospect I've cooled off on it a bit? I'll probably read it a second time when I get around to it, see how I feel about it then.
      Pale is, at the moment at least, my favourite of Wildbow's stories. 

      So if you really squeezed me for a ranking, I'd say at the moment it's Pale > Twig > Ward > Worm > Pact. But I've enjoyed them all immensely, more than most published books I've read, and more than all but a few of the web fiction I've seen.
      ```

  - u/Revlar:
    ```
    I'm married to Pact. I'm pretty sure this story is another Ward to Pact's Worm, so I don't really feel like reading "How Wildbow decided to erase his previous protagonist in favor of new characters who do everything better and get a happy ending at the end because the world doesn't fight them at every turn". It made me furious when Ward did it to Worm. Pale could be manna from heaven and I'd still have the whole thing spoiled by remembering Blake didn't get to be part of a trio of cute teenage witches who come of age learning to be practitioners for fun and profit.

    I'm glad Twig is free from this weird sequelitis pattern he's holding. The crap ending blows, but I'll take it over a sequel that kicks dirt on the original.

  Hi everyone, regular reader, irregular poster here to make a very rare recommendation I've been enjoying.

  I've been following and am here to recommend [Stars bound in shadows](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/stars-bound-in-shadows.98365/reader/), a fanfiction set in the Star Gate universe, with some minor Star Wars crossover elements where the MC has some out of context force powers. Knowledge of either universe is not required, but SG knowledge will help.

  Recently the author has been on an absolute terror posting multiple chapters per day, and today hit hit 250k words. The plot has arrived at a point where the 1990s world of Star Gate is getting a rather different introduction to goa'uld politics than as is canon in SG which has been a lot more rational than some of the earlier sections.

  The smaller chapters may irritate some readers but I find it fine personally.

    >a fanfiction set in the Star Gate universe, with some minor Star Wars crossover elements where the MC has some out of context force powers.

    Specifically, this fanfic is a crossover in which the author's Sith SI from his [previous Star Wars fanfic](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/rogue-knight-star-wars-si.315323/) is inserted into StarGate.

    You won't be disappointed so long as you go into it understanding that the SI is somewhat of a Gary Stu who roflstomps all of his opposition while almost everyone else stands in awe of him, especially in the more recent chapters.

    >Recently the author has been on an absolute terror posting multiple chapters per day, and today hit 250k words.

    For what it's worth, I enjoyed the first 13 chapters, after which the author went on a year-long hiatus to focus on his other fanfics. He came back to it this autumn, which is when he started up with the extremely fast update schedule and small chapters  (posting several times a day), which in my opinion corresponded to a drop in character depth and increase of Gary Stu qualities of the protagonist.

    Here's the SB version of the fanfic for those who aren't on SV: https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/stars-bound-in-shadows-sw-stargate-crossover.983008/
