    Huh, I guess I assumed that this story had been linked here before. It's certainly good enough to have been.

    Edit: Well, might as well explain it then. The premise it that Shikamaru isn't a lazy ass, and instead turns his sizable intellect towards being a ninja. The writing is proficient and the world seems very consistent. It's solid rational fiction.

  Oh a chiaroscuro update.

  Spoiler:
  The Kabuto death was unexpcted. At  a certain point I thought Kabuto killed and replaced Ibiki.

  Would have loved more stuff about Sand nins, really curios about how they were treated.
