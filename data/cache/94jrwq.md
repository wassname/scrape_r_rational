## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  You know that:

  * in a month from now your world is going to get RPG-ified 
  * people will get transported into a new dimension, without the ability to retain any clothes or items that were in their possession at the moment of transfer (everybody will be given standard equipment sets instead; people with implants will find themselves in more standard baseline human bodies)
   * they will be separated at first, then eventually be able to communicate with a random (growing) set of other people
  * each time someone manages to be the first one to accomplish something significant (kill a monster, kill a boss, clear an area, do something unique, etc), they get a bonus as a reward (a title that gives passive buffs, a skill, an item, experience points, etc)

  What plans do you come up with during this one month to accelerate your power accumulation once the new system kicks in? What calculations do you try to make (e.g to try predicting what approaches will likely be helpful for munchkining this yet-unknown RPG system), what risk factors do you try to keep in mind, etc?

  Your goals is to attain the quickest power accumulation rates among humans.

  Given the sheer number of people involved in this “experiment”, it is very unlikely that you’ll be able to stay on the edge of highest level “players” unless you come up with some really effective and unique strategies.

    I start looking up bug lists for major RPGs, and research how they were found, what caused them, how to trigger them, and how they were patched.

    A month from now, I'm gonna make myself invincible by overflowing my HP integer into the negatives, walk through walls by bugging out the collision detection, and bury the land in a mile-deep layer of cheese wheels through item duplication.

    If people are randomly scattered around this new dimension, I would try to learn Mandarin Chinese and Hindi, because being able to communicate with the people near me would be invaluable in forming alliances, resolving things through diplomacy, and trade. I already know English, which is a pretty good advantage considering how widespread it is, but it's not universal.

    For the actual combat bits, probably study military strategy and wilderness survival. It would be difficult to make any precise plans without more information, but being generally more proficient at strategy and being better able to survive without civilization would be useful.

    The nature of the setup means that you need to snowball in order to be successful. If you're the first to one to do something significant, then you now have a bonus that will help you get more of those first-past-the-posts bonus. That means that at the beginning, you want to be ready to go into immediate action. You have foreknowledge, so you can be mentally ready; most people, transported to a new rpg dimension will panic instead of going monster hunting. If you're immoral, trying to commit the first murder might be avenue to new titles and bonuses, which you can then use to snowball. Otherwise, just being the first monster killer, by sprinting right out of the gates and finding something small to strangle might give you enough of an initial boost to get rolling. 


    Another priority would be to make your skills, titles, and classes thematically unified. It seems like there are more potential unlocks for creating unified sets of skills, so staying on theme should help with that.  One skill that would be important to try to discover/create is something related to learning, in order to try to increase xp gain/skill growth. Meditation and visualizing also seems like a useful route to new unlocks and potentially magic. 


    So, to summarize. Since everybody is getting a standard body and no prior tools, the most important thing to get ready for the beginning is your mindset. If you can move faster than most people in the initial minutes, you can start a snowball. You should try to pick up skills that go well together, like rapier and Dodge, or wind and fire magic. Complementary skills are more likely to have further unlocks, which helps with your snowball. And during the preparation month, you should practice meditating, martial arts, and get comfortable with a weapon. Staffs would be a good choice, due to the ease of making/finding one in a new world. 
    It might not be enough to catch up to somebody already skilled in martial arts, but I think what would matter most is how you behave in the first minutes.

      Prepare and memorise a number of short proofs for basic mathematics (Pythagoras etc.). On arrival in the new world, *instantly* take a stick or something and (try to) be the first in the new world to write several proofs in the sand.

      Hope that this starts a useful snowballing. (Improved mental stats are particularly useful because that allows you to improve your stat-gaining strategy).

    If the skills from your life are transported to this new world then learning swordsmanship, archery or fighting in general is pointless, since there will be thousands of people that have been doing it for years. The skill gap would be too large to become a top player.

    The best bet would be to aim for skills not available in our life. Stuff like magic, healing etc. You could maybe prepare for this by learning some memorization techniques though obviously there's no guarantee this would be useful. 

    I imagine forming a group of like-minded people prior to the transition would be one of the priorities. A month is a long enough time that you could build trust and being with a group is safer plus you can accomplish more.

    This sounds a lot like you want us to kill everyone else in a month. Competing to be the first out of 7 billion is hard. Kill them all before the RPG-ification starts and it will become much easier to get these bonuses.

    Otherwise there's really only mundane strategies that everyone else will also be using. E.g. learning how to use a sword, how to dodge attacks, how to build traps, how to resist pain, etc. They will help you stay alive, but aren't likely to make you the best among humans since everyone else will almost certainly be doing the same, and there's no way in hell you can catch up to Olympic athletes in a month.

    Which kind of RPG? 
    Because the answer differs a lot depending on how seriously one needs to take death. 
    Is it primarily just pain and suffering, and a visit to the spirit healer, or is it permadeath? 

    Because in the latter case, the "First" incentives are a really obvious trap, and the world is going to belong to the people who level really, really cautiously. 

    In the first case - Where death is painful, but not permanent, read up on cognitive behavior theraphy as it relates to ptsd, and still level extremely carefully, because in this case, ultimate power will acrue to whoever manages to stay sane the longest. 

    Other obvious areas of study; Anthropology, and the study of non-human minds. Because diplomacy, if possible, is a path to success too. 

    Animal handling? Very few rpg style worlds do not have at least an option for combat capable pets. 

    The art of snares and traps. 

    General priority is not to go for any achivements, except the "Undying" title. When you are actually present, violence has consequences.

  Similar questions have been asked here before, but those discussions are old and I want to ask it in a slightly different form:

  How much $ would you pay for one, True™ bit? If an omniscient oracular device agreed to give you a completely true answer to any single answerable binary question, what's the highest amount of money you'd be willing to pay it for that answer? You ask the question and then some short (<1s), arbitrary amount of time later it answers. Assume you are completely convinced of its authenticity, but can't transfer that conviction to anybody else except through normal persuasive means. Questions that have no true answer (say, ones involving prediction of the future, and then you do the opposite of what it says, or whose answer otherwise affects the future in a manner that results in the answer being untrue) are instead drawn from a discrete uniform distribution over {0,1}. Ambiguities in question-wording are resolved by mind-reading your intentions and finding the closest well-specified question.

  You can pay money in three alternative manners: via 1) using already liquid funds, or through liquidating existing possessions, 2) using money borrowed through conventional means from a conventional, though unusually trusting loan officer, 3) using money borrowed from a supernatural loan agency that upon agreement teleports you to an extradimensional, extratemporal space, where your current bodily condition is maintained and you perform uninspiring hard labor full time at a rate of $100/day, and cannot otherwise use this opportunity to engage in meaningful work. You retain memory of your time here, but those memories are really boring. Your psychological health remains unchanged throughout your stay, so you are not driven insane by loneliness or other factors.

  How much money would you pay through the above methods for each marginal bit, assuming you can negotiate deal an arbitrary number of times? How many bits would you buy, and at what maximum total cost?

  How would your answer change if you could delay acquisition of bits indefinitely? Say, for a single bit -- you receive a magic coin that can be flipped while focusing on your question, and subtle forces interact to alter its trajectory such that it lands on the predefined "true" side, before becoming a completely mundane coin. The coin is transferable, but again, nobody but you is convinced of its power. The forces applied max-out after a single Joule has been used, so no creating perpetual motion devices that keep the coin forever spinning in an attempt to answer a known question, or whatever.

    If it maintains my psychological and physical state, I would obtain enough cocaine to be high, but safe, and then make the offer for one billion dollars. I'll be working for a long, long time, but I'll also be high, which I'm told is quite pleasant.

    I'd have to think really hard on what I wanted my true bit to be, but I think my method skirts the downsides fairly well.
    ```

  - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
    ```
    Well, the question is, how much $ could you get for one True bit? If you could use true bits to win lotteries, then you would naturally be willing to pay almost as much for the true bits as the lotteries winnings they would give you.

    If there's no limit to how many bits you can buy (other than cost), it's probably best to pool together all of humanity's funds to get the bits for an FAI.
    ```

    - u/phylogenik:

      Yah it depends on how sensitive the results are to your choices after seeing the bit(s). For a single bit you'd ideally find a roulette table-like system whose result has been determined beforehand and hidden, so that your success or failure is purely decided and deterministic -- this prevents your actions upon seeing the bit from affecting the outcome (e.g. if you bet red upon seeing red maybe the spin is affected or scrambled enough to fall on black, and if you bet black it falls on red. If the oracle sees both these occurring it'll just give you a random bit and call it a night). But most roulette systems probably aren't so sensitive, and so that lower bounds you to table maximums ($10k? $500k? the internet doesn't seem to have a firm answer). You might be able to get more value out of playing the stock market, again depending on the size of your investment and how much money you have left over after buying the bit to wager (and if your investment would affect the future trajectory of the stock). I'm not sure what the best opportunities for that sort of thing are; hence my question.

      You can also use it to obtains answers to "big" questions that might otherwise affect how you live your life, e.g. regarding your continuity of experience after death, or something. Or if you fancy yourself capable of doing great things, asking about futures where you didn't see the bit but dedicated yourself wholly to achieving some goal, and the proportion of those futures (e.g. > 0.5?) where your attempts succeeded. 

      In this hypothetical the decision to buy or not is being asked of you now, so pooling humanity's funds would be limited by your ability to convince others quickly, absent any evidence (only you are magically convinced). Still, I think if you're confident an AI likely to satisfy your values can be instantiated with, say, a billion bits, it's interesting to ask how many years of extratemporal labor you would be willing to trade for it (defining a marginal cost curve would be difficult, but seeing your average-maximum-payment-per-bit would be neat, esp. in comparison to how much you'd pay for smaller numbers of individual bits)?
      ```

- u/Clipsterman:
  ```
  Not sure if this is the right place to post it, but I can't think of a better place, so here goes:

  You are for all intents and purposes an AI implanted into the body of a 12 year old girl in the year 2010. Your one and only purpose is to make a 12 year old boy as happy as possible, according to your best estimate of what he thinks happiness is (so keeping him drugged up on heroin for eternity is off the table). You are fairly intelligent, but seeing as it is based on a human brain, you can't easily make yourself more intelligent (no more than you could in real life). It is expected that you will find out about rationalist methods relatively soon. What steps would you take in accomplishing your goal?

  To clarify, the reason I say that you are an AI is because you do not have any other goals. You do not have feelings other than wanting the boy to be happy. It is not love in a traditional sense since you will not become jealous. If the boy finds a girlfriend, and you believe he is happy, then that makes you happy. If you think the boy would be happier with you as his girlfriend (to the best of your ability as a rationalist), and you believe this would outweigh the unhappiness of a breakup, you may attempt to sabotage his relationship. You also have no morals unless you think that this would benefit in furthering the boy's happiness, so the use of murder and financial crimes to further your goals is on the table, assuming you won't get caught.

  Also, there is no preference for the boy's current happiness. You do not prefer an option that makes him happier now at the cost of being much unhappier later.
