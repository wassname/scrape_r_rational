  I get the feeling Kurama is slowly bartering senses off Naruto in exchange for more skills and power. And that he was purposely mucking up the chakra sheathing while Naruto was trying to practice earlier.

  Could he eventually turn Naruto into a puppet, I wonder? Have our blonde-haired hero call on his power and subvert control immediately, leaving the chakra-beast functionally free and in total control of Naruto's body?

  Kurama's malevolence is all but confirmed, thanks to that obvious lie paired with the manipulation.

  I wonder if Orochimaru's goal is to kill Kurama and the other beasts.

    What manipulation might that be?  *innocence*

  Orochimaru's actions make a lot more sense in the context of preparing for an existential threat. (\**cough*\**Akatsuki*\**cough*\*) Even if he's a complete sociopath interested only in the accumulation of knowledge, he'd still wish to prevent it. World-engulfing wars have an annoying tendency to destroy valuable tomes, and fighting for survival and/or experimental freedom is *such* a time sink.

    I'd say rather "biju subverting seals", but whichever works.

  After this we are back to the usual every-two-weeks schedule.

  Honestly this seems too powerful, considering it again. How does that work?

  Please put spaces between the words in CloneNaruto and RealNaruto. Camel case does not flow well in prose.

  Goddamn. Thank you so much for not making Kurama an ally. And Orochimaru is an enigma as ever.

  So good. Oh, that juice. Mmm.

    To add a bit stylistically, Shino did a lot of *glancing* at Naruto (not a crazy amount, but enough that I noticed).

    Also, the "modern usage" of the phrase "begs the question" can raise [plenty](http://begthequestion.info/) of [hackles](https://public.wsu.edu/~brians/errors/begs.html). Which, if Shino's supposed to be all precise and shit, might not be entirely fitting for his character (unless you're trying to use him to poke fun at pseudointellectual "pop-Bayesianism" or something).

      That wasn't careless writing.

      > "begs the question"

      I consider myself pretty well read, and I have only ever heard BTQ used in the sense that I used it.  The traditionalists may rail against its usage changing, but I'm afraid that the makers of Kleenex lost their fight too.  Personally, the one that gets me is that [not using the Oxford comma](http://imgur.com/gallery/fycHx) is often considered acceptable.

      I think traditionalists are better off simply using the phrase "circular reasoning", which is just as well known, shorter, and actually describes what it's referring to.
