  Thanks for sharing the story.

  ~~I like stories from the other side of a summoning grid.~~ Never mind that, it was only used as character introduction and backstory.

  I can't put my finger on what exactly was missing from this story, but in comparison to some other web originals it felt rather bland. I mean, it had its funny or interesting moments, but overall was... lacking, somehow. 

  Out of the outright negative characteristics there were these annoyingly boring romantic anime parts, the weird power dinamics going on between the genders, and the partially repulsive morality systems of the protagonist in particular and the species in general.

  My world faced its end, but I refused to perish with it! So I intercepted a summoning ceremony from another world.

  One moment!? My summoner tried to summon a demon? Fuck it, I think it’s better to break the contract and do my own thing… or not? Why is Mrs. Sacrifice hugging me? And why am I suddenly a child!?




  While not 100% ration all the time I give it >90%.  The characters act smart and rarely hold an idiot ball, the few times they do are character trait driven.  Quite an enjoyable ride.

  You can read this as an ebook/pdf, along with the authors other works (I have not had a chance to read them, so I cant vouch, but Beyound? was quite good) [here](http://armaell-library.net/author/andur)

  Jesus, that entire site is filled with the lowest common denominator of LN equivalents.

  What really gets my goat is that it's always "charachter is reincarnated" or "character is summoned." The *My Little Pony* fandom has more imagination; as at least they use portals that allow mutual travel between worlds.

    Isn't **A Hero's War** basically a generic portal fantasy?

    Come to think it, the other fic recommended from that site reminded me too much of a generic naruto fic SI despite the details being completely different.

      I don't mean to say that portal fantasies (even generic ones) are inherently bad, just that the ones specific to that site are. For example, A Hero's War takes a generic concept and diverges from it (multiple people are summoned, the focus is on *technological* change), while the stories on that site tend to take a generic concept and add even more generic concepts on top of it (monster girls (well, I guess AHW is a little guilty of this)! harem! demon king! wuxia-style magic! you get the point.)

      Note that I haven't actually *read* this, beyond some of the prologue, but so far things aren't looking good.

    I agree there is a lot of crap on royalroadl, but I have found a few good stories among the piles of shit.  I have a couple other suggestion from the site if you want, they are not really for /r/rational, but still good

      I'd like to hear your suggestions. More entertaining stories to read are always good! Other than Savage Divinity and /u/FarmerBob1's [Overseer](http://royalroadl.com/fiction/1353), I haven't come across very many good stories there yet. Although I'm new to the site and haven't been looking for very long.
