  Oh fuck. Akua has a foothold in reality.

  That was such a chaotic fight. Named are made and broken in fights like these, and Catherine, Akua and Masego are all learning new tricks. Skein OP tho.

  I had trouble following this one, but I enjoyed how Cat's change in perspective allows her to make much more versatile use of Winter.

  Dead King: I bet you can't realize the full power of your godhood during a fight with a sixty foot, causality reversing monstrosity.

  Cat: Hold my beer

  No, but seriously, what a great chapter. It's very emblematic of Cat to hammer away at the problem to the point where you lose any sense of self and all that's left is **Fall**.

  Right. I think the site ate my comment so I'll just put it here.

  Dammit. These chapters feel way too short.

  So I assume that whenever the Woe got too close to Malicia or the Skein, the ratling would just Spool and send them back to square one? I wonder what the limitations are. Why couldn't he just Spool them back to the palace when they started fighting? Or is the aspect usable like that only in this particular part of Keter? Regardless, I'm sure you can chalk this all up to 'stupid seer bullshit.'

  The narrative hasn't yet abandoned the Woe (they're far too entertaining), and we see yet another example of the self-balancing scales: the Skein pulls out some nonsense, and Masego produces a brand-spanking-new Aspect out of Namespace to fight back. Nothing so blatant as a perfect counter to Spool, of course, because that fuckery is the provenance of Heroes only, but a weapon nonetheless.

  And, while having Akua as a sort of 'magical collar Adjutant' is nice, I can't help but feel that Catherine is damning herself more and more with every inch of leeway she offers Diabolist - and in this chapter she gave her a goddamned country mile. (Cat deciding to take Akua's hand last chapter - even in spite of the circumstances - was definitely alarming.) She's setting a dangerous prescedent by allowing Akua to draw on Winter like she is in this chapter, and as we all know, Catherine is Winter and Winter is Catherine. Though, I suppose she really should have seen it coming when Cat made the decision to bind instead of destroying her. At the very least, if she was really keen on keeping Akua around, she should have blackboxed her *a la* Voldy in Significant Digits.

  Regardless, when it finally comes time for Cat to kill Akua as per her binding agreement with Viv - signed in spit, which is better than blood or ink - I'd be lying if I didn't say I would feel bad.

    Per Diabolist: "The aspect was bastardized, made contingent to this place.” It seems that Skein can only use Spool within the confines of its creepy bone lair.

      Yeah, I thought as much. That makes sense. I'm not sure where I was getting the time loop/Groundhog Day idea, now that I think of it.

      And it really makes you think: if this is a lesser version of Spool, limited only to one area and presumably neutered to some degree, what was it like when the Skein still lived? What kind of buttfuckery did the Heavens/the Dead King have to pull out to kill a seer on this level?

        I'm imagining that showdown as a fantasy-medieval adaptation of *All You Need Is Kill* (or Edge of Tomorrow, if you prefer Tom Cruise)
        ```

        I expect that paring it down also removed limitations. We've seen a few good heroes with some nasty limits. Though it likely wasn't all that limited in the first place - Names seem to alter a bit with the relative power of whatever bears them. A little. Hell, the Pilgrim has some real bullshit aspects and he's an old man. A Horned Lord Named? Yeech.

        Though capture would probably involve something like the foundling gambit crossed with the DK's way to avoid the bard. Enough ordinance that there are no options but death.

  I have no idea what happened in this chapter.

  ```
  > I glanced to the side, dragging the artefact further over the ledge, and froze when I saw myself standing near the gate, utterly furious. And again, in another shard, getting crushed by the Skein’s clawed hands as he seized the wheels.

  Between the choice of words, Skein's time resets being linked to his room and Aspect's triggering influencing its shape, I suspect Ruin breaks Creation in shards similar to what Masego saw in Arcadia, with Witness giving him the advantage in choosing who's interacting with what part. Whether or not the alternate realities are a consequence of each shard's course of events proceeding independently, Skein's Spool or Masego's covering of real Catherine's trajectory is to be determined.
  ```

- u/swaskowi:
  ```
  Just to clarify, *Ruin*, is Masego's actually factual second aspects, not just a heavier copy of Black's (the first being *Witness*)? Ruin doesn't really seems his style, more like *Extract* or just the namesake *Vivisect*.  If you ruin something its harder to learn from it or understand it.
  ```

  - u/GeeJo:
    ```
    Aspects are often a miniature story in themselves - 'Learn, Perfect, Transcend', 'Take, Break, Fall', 'Lead, Conquer, Destroy', etc.

    So I expect the third of Hierophant's aspects to be something similar to 'Rebuild'. He *sees* a miracle, he *takes it to pieces*, then *refashions* it in his own image.
    ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Part of his transition to Hierophant is his nature as one who takes miracles and makes them mundane. In other words, he ruins them. He looks at the true shape of Creation, sees that it is horrible, and can't wait to share the good news.

    At least, such is my interpretation.
    ```

    - u/Nic_Cage_DM:
      ```
      > He looks at the true shape of Creation, sees that it is horrible, and can't wait to share the good news.

      That's a great way to put it, I love it.
      ```

    - u/Halinn:
      ```
      Good news, everyone
      ```

  - u/OmniscientQ:
    ```
    I dunno. I could see an argument being made for it actually being his style. Even Catherine had to take a mental moment to note that **Ruin** says worrisome things about Masego and where he's headed. He's always stated that he intends to vivisect Creation itself so that he can build a home that can't be taken away from him (or prevent the Gods fron dismissing Creation). I could see him leaving Creation ruined as he squeezes it for every secret he can, and then discard the tattered remains to make room for his own.
    ```

- u/NebulousASK:
  ```
  Didn't really enjoy this one. The power creep has gotten ridiculous enough that I'm having trouble following the fight.

  I wonder if anyone is putting together TLDR summaries of each chapter so I can just skip the combats and enjoy the rest?
  ```

- u/None:
  ```
  So. Between the Skein severing causality, Masego shattering reality into shards and Cat becoming basically a domain with a grudge, we are getting into pretty abstract territory.

  Edit: also Cat using spider legs reminded me of the oil rig fight in Worm.
