  Other King for ancient undead rabbi confirmed?

    I was thinking it lends credence to the "Other King = Comet King" theory.

  Did anyone else think that the fourth rabbi was safe because there were no plants in the "orchard"?
  ```

  - u/awesomeideas:
    ```
    It might be useful to note that the orchard refers to paradise—Eden. Let's get some flaming swords up in here! 

    Also, Elisha's justification for Metatron being another god is that Metatron was sitting even though there is no sitting in heaven. 

    His disenchantment lead him to cease believing in Judaism, but most importantly the afterlife. Perhaps heaven=Eden, which he saw had been razed. I keep getting this vibe that there is no good afterlife in Unsong.

  I've been wondering about that.

    Maybe Uriel fixed some of the systemic issues with this. After all, it used to be that doing this would 'crash the Sephirot of the entire continent.' Now it only fucks a city? Uriel, you're a persistent sysop!

        Uriel is a deist. He believes God never gave any commandment and he is "SORT OF FILLING IN FOR HIM". In part V of [the passover chapter](http://unsongbook.com/chapter-17-that-the-children-of-jerusalem-may-be-saved-from-slavery/) Uriel explains that

        Every rule given to Moses is to save resources, except for 

        >UM. I THINK YOU SHOULD PROBABLY JUST BE NICE TO EACH OTHER. UNLESS BEING NICE TO EACH OTHER WOULD CAUSE SOME SORT OF HORRIBLE PROBLEM I CANNOT ANTICIPATE RIGHT NOW. THEN YOU SHOULD NOT DO THAT.

            I got the sense that Uriel was telling the story as it is traditionally told.
            ```

      - u/Frommerman:
        ```
        As far as we can tell, Uriel only told Moses this because continents tended to crash when it was done.
        ```

        - u/Iconochasm:
          ```
          JUST AVOID THAT ENTIRE CATEGORY OF THING.
          ```

    - u/CCC_037:
      ```
      Maybe the city was the only part Uriel couldn't restore from backup.
      ```

- u/LiteralHeadCannon:
  ```
  So now the big question is "is the Other King Acher, or is the Other King the Comet King?". I find the former more likely, but either is plausible.
  ```

  - u/vakusdrake:
    ```
    Normally it I would say it would be needlessly complicated if the other king was the comet king, and thus staged his own death.   
    However given the story being all about bizarre kabbalistic stuff, the fact it would be a convoluted theory _would actually lend it credence_.
    ```

    - u/Iconochasm:
      ```
      So this is a story where explanations get a complexity *handicap*?  Dear God, Scott, what have you done?
      ```

    - u/Gurkenglas:
      ```
      Convoluted theories need additional evidence because there are exponentially more convoluted theories than simple ones. A mere story theme can't overcome that.
      ```

      - u/scruiser:
        ```
        I think the story theme though means the evidence rate is linear for exponential convolution.
        ```
