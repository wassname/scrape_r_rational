  First of all: *sorry* for delaying a bit more the new Optimised Wish Project chapter! I'm working on it, but now and then I need to do something new to get my inspiration running again. So here's a short Bleach story to compensate. Writing Bleach rational fanfiction is something I've been thinking about for a while - it's temping but also hard, since the story has plot holes large enough to drive a train through. This isn't that, really, but rather a short rationalist parable about the Problem of Induction as applied to the very real issue (for Bleach characters, at least) of fighting an absolutely perfect illusionist. Enjoy!

    Thanks for writing something I thought should have been the original ending of bleach. I always thought the Aizen victory was a total cop out.

      Aizen is a perfect example of what happens when you let yourself get away a bit too much with handing down powers to your characters... though by the end of the Soul Society arc, I think he was still salvageable. My way of writing a 'rational' Aizen that's dangerous but realistically defeatable would have been:

      * not actually very strong physically, though skilled in kidou
      * his Kyouka Suigetsu only projects illusions that *he* pictures in his own mind, therefore can not show anything that he does not know, and require an effort of concentration that's greater when the illusion is more complex. This also puts a limit on how many people he can deceive at the same time
      * never achieved bankai, as suggested by Urahara in this story.

      Within these boundaries, Aizen could be an interesting 'trickster' villain, and Urahara his natural foil. Rational!Bleach would end up looking like a battle of two masterminds in which everyone else is mostly a pawn.

      Another option would be for Ichigo to learn to fight him with his eyes closed. He never saw Kyouka Suigetsu and could keep that up, which would remove Aizen's main advantage over everyone else. In fact I always assumed while reading Bleach that *that* would be the reason why the Gotei 13 would ask Ichigo's help in fighting him. Turns out Kubo didn't think that far at all.

  So there is a way to tell if you are in the illusion then: check whether the world is fair to you.

  Because the real world is fair in its unfairness to everyone. Random accidents happen all the time for no reason other than the butterfly effects of random whims far in the past. Measure the rate of such accidents happening to strangers, then measure the rate of such accidents happening to the people you care about. If there is a statistically significant difference between the two, you're in an illusion that is catered to you.

    I see a few problems with that. First, they don't know that for sure - Aizen states he's willing to give them "better" worlds but that's far from obvious. A more sadistic enemy could give them worse ones on purpose; others could simply try to go for realism. So you still have a layer of uncertainty - maybe you're just a lucky person? They surely do exist, not everyone happens to have a perfectly average amount of positive and negative outcomes. And on a human level, you're basically saying that you should prompt yourself to automatically detach yourself from the world if it's making you happy. People do that plenty IRL ("I don't deserve this", "it's too good for me", etc.), and usually it's not healthy.

    Second, what if the world is simply produced by *their own* expectations, and thus mirrors exactly their expectation of unfairness too? I think that makes more sense in this model because it lightens Aizen's otherwise rather excessive load by having everyone imagine their own world. But in that model, *by definition*, you can't ever notice anything off - because if you think it would be off, it won't happen in the first place.

      >  A more sadistic enemy could give them worse ones on purpose 

      That would also result in a statistically significant difference, letting you know that the world is an illusion catered to (hurting) you.

      > others could simply try to go for realism 

      The problem then is: how? People are inherently terrible at being realistic. We consistently expect things of the world that end up being absurdly optimistic compared to reality, even when we're trying to be realistic. A demon like Descartes imagines could be intelligent enough to do that, but Aizen is still only human. 

      >  So you still have a layer of uncertainty - maybe you're just a lucky person?  

      Which is why you have to apply statistics rather than just compare the difference. Sure among 7 billion humans there are going to be lucky ones, and then among those lucky ones there's going to be even luckier ones, and so on, but that hits a limit pretty quickly. If the difference in the two rates is small and your sample size is small, then sure, you could be just lucky. But if it is huge or stays statistically significant no matter how many samples you gather, that's a pretty big clue that either you're the most lucky person out of all 7 billion people on earth (which is incredibly unlikely), or you are in an illusion.

But in that model, *by definition*, you can't ever notice anything off - because if you think it would be off, it won't happen in the first place. 

      That would be even easier to determine is an illusion. After all, like you said: by definition, you can't ever notice anything off. In reality, people rarely notice things are off, but it *does* happen from time to time. So the longer you never notice anything off (other than the fact that you still haven't noticed anything off), the more likely it is that you are in an illusion created by your expectations.

      I'm not saying that. This is just a tool for figuring out whether you are in an illusion. Whether you should detach yourself from an illusory world is your own choice. Personally, I don't see the point in detaching since you are still stuck in the illusion anyway. A better method would be trying things to overload the illusion: like creating countless cameras, placing them everywhere, and having them all feed visual data to you all the time, forcing the illusion to constantly compute the data of every location you are filming. That way, if the illusion is being maintained by either you or the illusioner, it could break down from the fact that neither of you humans is capable of computing that much data at once. It's not guaranteed to work, but it's a start. 

      After that you could try even more desperate things like launching some of those cameras off into space to force the illusion to have to compute a larger fraction of the universe, or abusing special relativity by accelerating yourself to near light speeds, and so slow down your own time such that 1 second to you is X years for the rest of the world: X years that have to be computed by your illusion in the 1 second you experience.

        The question is, what really *creates* the illusion? Aizen, Kyouka Suigetsu itself (following more or less liberally its owner's instructions, like some sort of super artificial intelligence), or the victim? As I said above, if I wanted to write a *balanced* Bleach, I would make it Aizen, and then all the vulnerabilities you bring up and more would indeed exist. However Kyouka Suigetsu *could* be able to work out all the details, which would make this much harder. In canon, no such vulnerabilities are suggested, so I'm more inclined to go the "it's just magic, it always works" road (which is what I went with in this story).

        > Which is why you have to apply statistics rather than just compare the difference.

        But it comes at no expense for the system to just raise the general rate of luck. If you're not supposed to die of cancer, the illusion could just say "invented cure for cancer!". Boom, no cancer for anyone any more. Now the thing is, of course, a *pool* of people with reliable information and no bias on average could still find a crack in this facade. But a *single* person, with limited knowledge, specific biases, some of which they'll be unaware of, and no reliable pre-illusion knowledge (it's all just in their memory), *plus* no certain knowledge of when the illusion even began? There's far too much uncertainty to draw any conclusions. I could easily rationalise the idea that *my* world right now is an illusion, but most likely that would just me being psychotic.

        > So the longer you never notice anything off (other than the fact that you still haven't noticed anything off), the more likely it is that you are in an illusion created by your expectations.

        What if your expectations include sometimes noticing weird shit? I think you can go more and more meta in this reasoning and never reach the bottom.

        > I'm not saying that. This is just a tool for figuring out whether you are in an illusion. Whether you should detach yourself from an illusory world is your own choice.

        Well, in Ichigo's case, he'd get paranoid about having been trapped and defeated by a dangerous enemy. So that would inevitably translate into basically sapping the joy out of the rest of his life. It's hard to detach the two things. If you worry about being in an illusion, it means you consider reality intrinsically superior (like Gin does). If you don't, you may be actually willing to step into one by yourself (like Tousen) and then wouldn't worry about it as long as you're satisfied.

        > like creating countless cameras, placing them everywhere, and having them all feed visual data to you all the time, forcing the illusion to constantly compute the data of every location you are filming.

It's not guaranteed to work, but it's a start.

        I think the weak point in that is that ultimately all comes down to a bottleneck: you. Suppose I studied particle physics and sat down at the LHC, reading its outputs. The LHC produces several TB of data per second, much of which is automatically pruned out by algorithms, the rest is copied and stored in multiple servers. Now, when a scientist looks at this data, they *still* can only take in as much as their senses can work with. So no illusion would need to *actually* process all the quantum weirdness stuff and then produce TB of data and then refine that into the plots that he looks at on screen. It would just need to produce the plots. And by definition, those plots would fit the knowledge of the subject, so they would be good enough to fool them. 

        Sure, you could photograph or save them, and then go study nuclear physics *better*, and see if they still match your expectations. But you'd be looking at illusions, again. Why should the copies stay the same? And in this scenario, Infinite Mirror can even manipulate your memory. So your own memory of them would be unreliable. Any attempts to uncover the illusion will only lead to further, subtler manipulations.
