  I am continuing a Pratchett marathon, and am currently in The Last Continent. From that novel:

  *'I told you about time and space here being mixed up,' said the kangaroo.*

  *'I've already saved the country, have I?'* 

  *'Yep.'*


  *'Oh, good. Well, that wasn't so difficult. I don't want much – a medal, perhaps, the grateful thanks of the population, maybe a small pension and a ticket home . . .' He looked up. 'I'm not going to get any of that, though, am I?'* 

  *'No, because—'*

  *'—I haven't already done it yet?'* 

  *'Exactly! You're getting the hang of it! You have to go and do what we know you're going to do because you've already done it. In fact, if you hadn't done it already I wouldn't be here to make sure it gets done. So you'd better do it.'*
  ```

    Time paradoxes make a lot more sense when you start thinking in terms of personal timelines instead of overall Time. I always thought it was silly but that whole "wibbly wobbly" thing the Doctor Who fans have going is pretty accurate if you have time travel, looking more like a tangled ball of string than a river of one-way-flowing time.

    And if any of that made no sense to you, it's OK. It mostly doesn't to me either.
