  Stuff that players really need to try:

  * Dam up part of the creek and try swimming (attempt to unlock a *Swim I* skill). Players may not know how to swim; swimming may be required for other parts of the arena. *Language I* skill implies that the nanites are willing to grant basic skills to allow for shortcomings due to origin or culture. Also, complete immersion in water may unlock a Water Prime skill.

  * Climb a tree. As with swimming, above, this is something many players may simply not know how to do very well, and may open options in the Arena. It's also a convenient escape if confronted with a monster too dangerous to defeat.

  * Always treat injuries through mundane means if possible. Get everyone *First Aid I* skill ASAP. Can also earn NPs this way.

  * Draw a map of the lands near the encampment. *Maps I* skill might be unlocked this way.

  * Attempt to channel or transfer both EPs and NPs from player to player, following the Generation cycle (i.e. Nathan to Asahi; Asahi to Lilly; Lilly to Ilya; Ilya to Emma; Emma to Nathan).

  * Plant a nut. See if Wood allows food to be grown by using EPs.

  * Despite how grotesque as it is, cleave a dead Horned Beaver under the effect of *Harvest Monster I* into several smaller pieces, then separate them. See what vanishes and what remains.

  * *Edit: Adjust nicknames to see if they can be used for long range communication! If non-leaders can see their nicknames at ranges greater than 100 feet, this can permit one-way messages to be sent across the arena.*

  * *Edit: Attempt to Fuse Lilly's headdress with her wristband to give her a Heads-Up Display.*

  I like the rewritten chapter 18 better; while I didn't have any problems with how Maya and Ilya talked to Nathan previously, him snapping and hitting Harrison out of nowhere seemed rather out of character.

    I thought it was an improvement as well. The one thing I'd walk back a bit is the explanation of Nathan's actions. What he did was sensible, but the justification should have been kept to the dialogue with Maya - not given alongside those actions.

      Thanks for the feedback.  I do have a tendency to over explain things.

      Getting words on paper has never been an issue for me as I crank out these 9k word chapters every week.  My first drafts are usually 11k words or longer so editing mostly consists of figuring out how much of my musings and analysis to delete to make it readable.  Then I end up adding a bunch more analysis in its place which I then subsequently go back and chop through again.

      If I hire a professional editor at some point to go over my whole story, I imagine pointing out the fluff that still needs to be cut will be the major focus of their efforts.

      Ironically, I even probably over explained in this comment.  :P

        I respect the hell out of your attitude toward criticism, /u/Gilgilad7. This is going to be a great story by the time you wrap it up.

  Damn, I missed this story on its week off. It isn't written the best, and the prose is a bit boring, but the implications are great and the world is unfolding at a believable pace. I'm starting to actually care about the players too, which is interesting.

  A couple chapters ago, I requested the author add character sheets for important players to be updated at the end of chapters so we can keep track of their progress. I don't think it's necessary anymore.

  *Leadership I* skill is attention-grabbing. I'm guessing that the status effects show as a Buff, but last as long as the player is grouped.

  *[Choose one of the following group leader status effects to set as active.  The choice may only be changed once every full day and night cycle:]*

  * *[8% boost to speed and acceleration.]*

  * *[10% boost to reflexes.]*

  * *[10% boost to physical defense.]*

  * *[5% boost to all five elemental resistances.]*

  * *[20% boost to debuff resistance.]*

  * *[1.5x boost to natural recovery effects.]*

  * *[8% boost to EP regeneration.]*

  * *[15% boost to all NP gains.]*

  The EP regeneration in particular looks very tempting, but the NP boost is still the clear winner. Note that while these effects can only be changed once per day, group membership looks far more dynamic. You could have leaders specialized by situation. For example, Maya could opt to take the 8% boost to EP recovery and swap players into her group to allow them to recharge more quickly.

  This skill's interaction when two or more leaders are grouped together could also be interesting. Maybe only one leader is allowed, but it's also possible - and somewhat in the nature of the game - that everyone brings something to the table. A group could have six of the eight effects listed running simultaneously.

  It'd also be interesting to see how this interacts with skills such as *Improved Heart I*. Maya could get her EP recovery up to 140.4% (130% x 108%).
  ```

    ```
    There are some other optimizations you could pursue with Leadership. While I think it would be overly optimistic that players could join multiple groups at the same time, so only one active effect per person, You could get some extra benefit by having multiple leaders running different effects at once. So between battles, everyone groups up to the EP boost leader, then right before combat switches to the NP boost. Or, depending on how quickly everyone can switch between leaders what with the bracelet touching and menu fiddling, have a third leader with some combat boost, then switch to NP before killing the last enemy.

    In other news, Nathan is probably going to feel obligated to grind his Analyze Enemy skill since it provides a boost to crafting. He would do well to test if it can be activated remotely via rock-throwing like his other skills. What they really need to do is figure out some kind of rope or vine setup, use the skill on a rock tied to the end, then swing it around until it hits something. No unlucky misses that way.

      > In other news, Nathan is probably going to feel obligated to grind his Analyze Enemy skill since it provides a boost to crafting.

      This skill is starting to look very critical. Nathan has the affinity, but needs NPs and a couple more Mental to upgrade it. He'll have to obtain or upgrade a Mental skill to get there. (*Language II* would do this at the cost of an additional 40 NPs - ouch.)

      Knocking the EP cost down from 8 to 6 or so would be great. It isn't clear if the upgrade would get him more info or simplify skill use. Maybe both?
