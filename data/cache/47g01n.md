## [Q] What canonical Harry Potter spells, potions or enchanted items could be munchkin.

### Post:

I am looking for those items that a person of average intelligence without any special education would think of. Furthermore, I want effects that either result in the effective nullification of a canonical magical law or in a society that appears much different than the one found in the books.

These items must be the sort that could be obtained by an average magical person. So NO time turners.

  Aguamente is the most overpowered thing ever. From ending the tyranny of the rocket equation of reversing entropy.

    Magic already breaks the first law of thermodynamics. I don't really see how this gains you a special advantage with wizards (although it certainly does against muggles).
    ```

      Threaten your enemies with orbital kinetic bombardment. The thermodynamic part comes in on a really long timescale, but infinite rocket fuel is game breaking anytime.

  There aren't many magical laws in canon. Of those there are:

  * Cannot create food from nothing - ok, just *engorgio* a dust-speck and transfigure that into food. Or a thousand other ways.
  * Can't raise the dead - I know you said no time-turners, but canonically, they're a more stable (read: can travel back further) container for the Hour-Reversal Charm, which can be learned.
  * OK, OK, going back and replacing your friend with a convincing fake isn't *technically* raising the dead. Neither is creating a portrait and teaching it to convincingly mimic you. Horcruxes aren't exactly commonplace ... consciousness in Harry Potter does exist in the brain, since transfiguring someone into an animal gives them the animal's brain; and spell research is possible; so I'd suggest this as a possible avenue to Transfigured clones. (Or if you just need a quick conversation, it's worth noting that Avada Kedavera stores a semi-tangible "echo" of the target in the caster's wand forever.)
  * Incidentally, Horcruxes are created by the evil-ness of killing someone, and un-created by remorse; so you've just got to drive someone to murder in a convincing simulation, make a Horcrux, and then tell them it was fake so they don't feel bad about it. May or may not have harmful side-effects.
  * In terms of social collapse: mind-modification is easy, so getting away with crimes is also pretty easy. Also, it's not that hard to control someone and put them in power. Both of these happened in canon, though.
  * Since magical labour is basically the only scarce good in the wizarding world, and they have mind control, anyone who enslaves people is going to have an insurmountable economic advantage. I'm pretty sure Rowling didn't think of this.

    Magical slavery is a good example. We know that Fred and George tried to trick Ron into an unbreakable vow (and got in trouble), so it can't be that hard to do. I can't see any realistic way to prevent this. Since it was used canonically, the problem is why it did not happen a lot more often.

  Harry Potter magic is full of exploitable loopholes that could basically make you an overpowered munchkin.

  Transfiguration is probably one of the most powerful disciplines that we see in canon yet the main cast barely uses it to its full potential.

  HP magic is incredibly versatile (especially since it appears to be conceptaul instead of anything reductionist) so if you have some skill and can think creatively you will go far.

  For example think about the Confundus charm which basically makes the target believe almost anything temporarily.  Not only is this a great mind control spell it could also be used in other novel ways.  What if you perform a Confundus charm on a computer to trick it into giving you administrative privileges, you could basically hack into computers whenever you want.

  And that's just off the top of my head, there are lots of possible uses for even the simplest of charms.
  ```

  - u/KZLightning:
    ```
    Good point on the transfiguration. I expect that powerful fighters always use transfiguration because of its AOE qualities. If I transfigure the floor to lava, then you will burn. Perhaps I could transfigure the air around you into nerve gas.

  What is food?

  At what point can you be far enough outside of the range of the exceptions to Gamp's Law to be able to create food? Can proteins and vitamins be created if, for example, they were created as parts of rocks?

  Also Liquid Luck.

  edit: Can you transfigure things into potions?

  A potion of basilisk blood + gemino, toss into Gringotts -> all of Gringotts vault melts under a flood of basilisk blood
  ```

  - u/PlaneOfInfiniteCats:
    ```
    I applaud you.
    You just single-handedly combined two canon concepts to get Grey Goo.
    Because I suspect that after Basilisk blood melts Gringotts, it will then proceed to melt **everything else**.

      Well according to the wiki the spell can be cancelled by the caster.

  Basically anything for any reason. HP is broken as shit. Print out some binary and use Alohomora to break encryption keys, for example.

  A more difficult challenge would be coming up with an ultimately reductionist system that both includes harry potter magic as part of it, and explains why the wizards haven't muchkined it to hell and back.

      That is rather creative. The idea that the fidelius charm could hide personal knowledge actually makes a degree of sense. That charm is definitely exploitable.
      ```

  - u/KZLightning:
    ```
    This assumes that the open spell could be applied to cryptography. That is extremely unlikely.
    ```

    - u/GaBeRockKing:
      ```
      The writer ultimately decides exactly how spells work anyways, if they're not spelled out in canon. If something is muchkinable, that's because you let it be.

    > Print out some binary and use Alohomora to break encryption keys, for example.

    This seems less like munchkinry and more like a no-limits fallacy so vast as to imply that a spell which can open some - not even all! - locks would be able to unlock *abstract mathematical concepts, what the hell.*
    ```

    - u/GaBeRockKing:
      ```
      Back in high school, my math teatchers always liked to tell the "white elephant" joke. How do you kill a blue elephant? With a blue elephant gun. How do you kill a white elephant? Choke it until it turns blue, then hit it with your white elephant gun.

      There's bound to be *some* way of encoding information as physical locks, which alohamora can demonstratively open.
      ```

      - u/eaglejarl:
        ```
        Sure. The tumblers in a lock are effectively binary -- they're on the shear line of they aren't.

        More importantly, Alohomora "unlocks doors". It doesn't specify that it has to be a tumbler lock. Presumably Al will also open deadbolt-locked rooms, so it should likewise unlock electronic keypad locks. Once you can do that, you're golden.
        ```

        - u/frozenLake123:
          ```
          And then it just tells the electronic keypad to unlock the door, regardless of the number entered, as that would take less effort on the spells part to make it jump to an instruction than to actually crack the code.
          ```

  I don't know all the myriad technicalities of the Potterverse, but two points of attack I'd consider are whether muggles can use/wield/cast any kind of magical device/effect/spell whatsoever (even one which is completely useless), or what canonically separates a wizard from a muggle - something in the DNA, as per HPMOR? Are there wizards with brain damage who can still cast or use artifacts? Ones who are effectively brain-dead but still register as 'wizard' to some kind of detector?
  ```

  - u/KZLightning:
    ```
    What would you do with a wizard that was brain dead? If muggles could use some magical artifacts, what then? They still cannot make them.
    ```

    - u/Geminii27:
      ```
      Just curious about what constitutes the bare minimum of a functioning wizard brain by magical standards - and therefore how much of a live wizard isn't technically required to be present, either physically or psychologically.

      Endless rows of lobotomized brains in jars churning out spells or simply gathering/channeling magic power, anyone?

      As for muggles, it depends on what they can and cannot use. If you can create a spell (or spell framework) which artificially churns out artifacts that muggles can use, there are an *awful lot* of muggles compared to wizards. 100,000 artificial stunner spells could do a lot in a wizard/muggle battle.
      ```
