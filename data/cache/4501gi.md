## [Q][D] Rational Pixels, yes the Adam Sandler film

### Post:

I watched it a bit ago just for fun and I started really thinking hard about the tech the aliens have. It seems to be extremely advanced micro to nanomachine type stuff, as not everything made from the pixels is, well, pixelated. Hell, the pixels form a fully-functional (organs and everything) sentient human being *easily*. One of the main characters even has pixel-based children with this thing. The creator of Pac-Man even gets his arm re-made with said pixels, and its fully functional right from the get-go.

I feel like there's a lot of room for exploitation here. The pixels seem to be able to mold into anything on command and even convert other objects into more pixels.

Can Pac-Man's creator now initiate his own grey goo type scenario? Converting the world into more of him with his arm? Can he convert a bunch of random dirt into a functioning AI and then link it with several others? Since the aliens are capable of casual interstellar travel can the pixels be used for FTL technology?

  I think the greatest challenge is that the possible story space is both too large and too narrow. 

  I say that because the "hyper-advanced nanomachine aliens" bit is all that you can really work with- as you've observed, the pixel part was mostly just to try to adapt to what they thought was local imagery. Once you move past it, you just have standard suffeciently-advanced-aliens, which much of fiction (especially rational fiction) has thoroughly explored.  So past that, the only part of substance one can gain is having more rational versions of established characters explore this new space- and since the setting is otherwise boring and the characters uninteresting, you don't have much there. 

  Not trying to shoot down creativity- if you want to try to make something interesting out of it, PLEASE DO! I'm just giving honest feedback.
