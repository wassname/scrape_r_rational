## Physics help with magic

### Post:

My knowledge is sub-layman, and I have a question for a quick story I have to do. The arena:

Generic pop magic. A substance called mana is its vehicle. Spirits are mana-based organisms. Among them are souls, symbiotes who use carbon lifeforms as shells (some older creatures, elementals, use nonliving stuff). Employment of magic by life starts as tiny-scale delegation of work and complexifies as increasingly complex organisms are able to create increasingly complex commands, then sentients with culture develop it at a much faster rate than biological selection.

Which leaves the question I need help with. How could fluctuations in this substance called mana, whose nature pends on an answer, rearrange energy? What would be the mechanism? Steps like mana nanobots are obvious, but what I'm wondering is how, granting fictional but consistent physics, these subatomic changes could actually be produced.

All that I'd like to be true is that these spells resemble harry potter/d&d/world of warcraft ones. If they can employ recognizable spellcasty stuff like vocal commands, gestures, implements, that would be a bonus.

Knowledge? Ideas?

  Alright, well my (unsolicited) storytelling advice is just to not worry about it. Unless your story is going to exploit some aspect of the magic system, you don't need to explain why saying *Kelenta* produces a fireball, it's enough to know that it does. And you don't need to explain to the readers how saying *Kelenta* produces a fireball, they only need to know that this is possible. Telling them how it works is probably to the detriment of the story if it's unimportant, due to the Law of Conservation of Detail.

  I can't actually help you with making a counterfactual system of physics whose result is classical D&D physics. I *highly* doubt that there's anyone who can do that, given the gaps in our knowledge about actual physics. And even if you did get there, you'd probably have to posit counterfactual biology to make people able to use it, which means counterfactual evolutionary history. And all of that to arrive at the same old system of magic.

  The story I've seen that comes closest to having a particle system of magic is *Ra* by Sam Hughes (/u/sam512). You can read about [what magic is here](http://qntm.org/what), which shouldn't have any spoilers, but it doesn't actually go into the "physics" of the system, which I assume weren't mapped out even though Sam *does* have a working knowledge of particle physics, mostly because there's (again) not much of a point to it.

  My (unsolicited) advice is to think of all the "rules" that your system has, whether any of them are actually false in some clever way that people haven't figured out, and what the answers are to all of the experiments that you can immediately think of.

  If you're looking for general inspiration...

  I wrtoe [this](https://traverseda.wordpress.com/2014/04/06/computable-magic/) a while back, which was an attempt to approximate vancian magic using something at least sort of reductionist.

  [Days of Wasp and Spider](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/6515/days-of-wasp-and-spider) had a similar mechanism.

  This was kind of a dumbly wide net.

  A proximate thought I had was, and I don't know how plausible: magic as a kind of dispersed nanofiber made by older entities, which has become overgrown with emergent life that's (increasingly less) blindly rediscovering its command language. Some kind of field of...vibrations?...that can rearrange matter and receive commands. Over long periods, certain unbiological motions would have in rare cases approximated these commands and given rise to the perturbation in the manafield that made it fertile for emergent life.

  It's just, the less William Paley it is the better. The more natural, if unlikely, the nature of mana is, the better.

  Verbal commands and accoutrements could be linked to human devices for controlling mana more adeptly, rather than the magic itself.

  I have like 20 of these, of varying quality, 'cause making attempts at this very things is one of my favorite things to do when my eyes and hands are occupied but my brain isn't, but sadly have never manged to *write them up*. Maybe if you can be more specific and/or contact me over PM and then Skype (don't want to put my skype here publicly) we could work one out together?

  Orion's arm has matter made of magnetic monopoles which they discuss here: http://www.orionsarm.com/eg-article/48630634d2591 (see the section Interactions Between Magmatter and Normal Matter). It can normally phase through matter, but if "magnets" are made with it, they'll interact with normal matter. Granted, it's also extremely strong, absurdly dense, and it has a tendency to cause proton decay making it more dangerous than antimatter, but that's just due to the specifics of Orion's arm. Just make it of comparable mass with conventional matter and don't cause proton decay.

  For extra fun, add in a fifth force, and include stuff that conventional matter doesn't interact with at all. Perhaps magical flight is just swimming in a dark matter sea that nobody else notices.

  As for the actual mechanics of spells, perhaps you could make it so trained spirits are used, and the spells are just commands.
