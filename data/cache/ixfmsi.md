  There was another post for this chapter, but I think it got deleted? I'm just gonna copy-paste the comment I made on that earlier post here:

  I don't like following up a cliffhanger with a flashback that doesn't resolve it, but this was nonetheless an interesting chapter.

  I really like the juxtaposition of presenting and vindicating Commonplace's arguments while also showing just how monstrous they're willing to be in pursuit of their goals. The fact that Commonplace was willing to murder an innocent girl and then *replace her* is horrifying, but she wouldn't have died if Isaac Brin didn't come in with overwhelmingly and unnecessarily lethal force and then deny everyone but "Matilda" medical care. Commonplace's scheme wouldn't have worked if Paragon gave shit about Humdrums (I mean, they probably had contingency plans in place, but you get what I'm saying). It shows you why Commonplace exists and that there is a genuine need for what they're fighting for while also making you want them to fail, in this moment if not in the big picture.

  It really underlines a feeling I've had for... basically the whole book. I want Commonplace to win while also wanting Commonplace to lose. I want to see the world Commonplace is striving for come to be, but I don't want Commonplace to be a part of it. I want our protagonists to join Commonplace's *cause* without aiding its *means*.

  I really like that the story evokes this feeling, that the rebels and revolutionaries are dangerous and extremist in their methods rather than just being a plucky band of freedom fighters. It makes it feel more authentic and... relevant, I guess? Real revolutions are bloody, messy, violent affairs, often seeing atrocities committed on both sides, and I'm glad the story isn't shying away from that.

    That's some really good analysis. Following up on it, I think that Commonplace isn't going to be able to meet their goals, at least by their hands. They're an organization meant to promote the rights of humdrums and get rid of the oppressive power structure, but they're full of projectors and the elite. This could be excused somewhat by the fact that you need high level projectors and resources to run a revolution; however, the fact that they're puppetting the humdrum side of the organization means that the humdrums don't have any legitimacy. If they want the humdrums to come out with actual power, the shady projector side of it is going to eventually have to sabotage itself and take itself out.

  I haven't seen it pointed out, but Matilla is the student that Brin told Ana about, the one who was beaten up by a baseball bat after waving around her silver letter, talked about in chapter 1-E. Later she takes Kaplen's place on his team.

  I really like how characters who are mentioned in passing end up having their own part to play later on. It feels like every detail matters. I'm enjoying this story.

  I was thinking "who's this matilda chick" And then got hit by the plot out of left field. Good stuff.

- u/alphanumericsprawl:
  ```
  I think there's a general underlying rule in Pith where characters are mortal directly proportional to how much they're suffering.

  Matilla was having way too much of a good time getting accepted to Paragon- she practically put a target on her back. Even Kaplen was way too cheery when he was cheery. 

  This is why the main cast survives. Ana is literally invincible by now, Wes isn't far off it. I can use this to predict that Lorne is going to die when Commonplace execute their attack on Paragon. He's an enormous prick but also rich and happy. That can't last.
  ```

  - u/AcceptableBook:
    ```
    A possible counter-example to your theory is Isaac Brin. He suffers almost as much as Ana and Wes do, especially given that he lost really hard against Commonplace and is paralyzed permanently. However, he's not a main character, so it's possible he will die when the time comes

      not dead tho, the suffering inflicted upon him has only made him stronger.

  ```
  Man, the last few chapters were basically "Paragon really is terrible, maybe Commonplace is (with exception to the bombings) are the good guys."

  Then you get hit with this chapter and now there's no one to root for.
  ```

  - u/CouteauBleu:
    ```
    I mean, they sponsored a serial killer who routinely abducted,  mind-raped and discarded innocent people. They were never the good guys.
    ```

    ```
    This is the only chapter of the story I've read, but it really made me hate Commonplace.

      Why would you start at the end and not the beginning?

      In any case, it's like /u/Don_Alverzo said, there are not really any good guys here, just bad guys fighting for a good cause.

      Commonplace is the bad guy here, in almost every other chapter it's Paragon.

        > Why would you start at the end and not the beginning?

        Speaking for myself, sometimes I start stories with the most recent chapter to get an idea how good the story is once it hits its stride. The first chapters are often bogged down by exposition, stations of canon, and meandering writing, especially if it's the author's first major story.

        The downside is you get some spoilers, but if the story is long enough then you won't understand them enough to remember them by the time they're relevant (eg someone starting Pith with 9-E would only be spoiled about the Maxine Clive reveal, and it's quick enough they might not even remember it by the time that name's relevance becomes clear).

        ```
        I didn't understanding the coding for the chapter number and the title read like a standalone. The chapter also did a fine job of being a standalone.
