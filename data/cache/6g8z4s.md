## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  My apologies in advance for having two different topics I'm willing to discuss, none of which have any relation to each other. If you want to respond to both, do so in separate comments.

  Recently at work I was partnered with a socially conservative man for a day who was completely civil to me and votes democrat, but explained that he didn't think gay people had a right to get married specifically because the Bible says it's a sin. He explained that he doesn't take all of the Bible literally (even if he didn't explain how he concluded his interpretation was correct), though he sternly stated that he sees the Bible as factual and rejects alternative interpretations. He made it clear he wants the law to discourage people from thinking sinful behavior is morally permissible, so he doesn't want gay people to adopt children or hold pride parades.

  I told this man I was pansexual and tried my best to deconstruct his arguments when I had time to speak to him, but I failed. I thanked him for being more polite than most homophobes, but I still feel disappointed in myself. Not just for failing to persuade him, I feel conflicted over allowing myself to empathize with him at all. When I see Facebook posts celebrating LGBT pride I impulsively feel some disgust because I allowed myself to consider that perspective, which makes me feel guilty for thinking that way and thinking it was in any way okay for him to continue thinking that way. I wonder if I should've been more aggressive in my rejection of his ideals.

  I don't think aggression would've been more likely to persuade him, I'm just uncertain whether I should be the kind of person who adamantly sticks to my morals. I have allowed myself to consider alternative perspectives that I know are false and reprehensible, and that feels like a betrayal to people I do care about and should care more about. The fact that I didn't implicitly hate such casual homophobia using distorted religious doctrine as justification, when I am a religious liberal myself, makes me question just how morally upstanding I am. Shouldn't I hate him or at least what he believes more strongly? Can I just...decide to feel differently?

  While watching the show Gargoyles I found myself wondering what the basic emotional appeal of the gargoyle as a mythological creature is. Vampires, werewolves, ghosts, mages, and The Fair Folk all reflect obvious wonders and fears in human cultures, but the origin of the gargoyle appears to be as stylized gutters in gothic architecture that somehow because associated with protective spirits. It's harder to rationalize a fantasy creature when there isn't a clear narrative purpose for them.

  Then it occurred to me that Gargoyles may not be an urban fantasy since it doesn't have that same appeal. It's more like a gritty reimagining of the Ninja Turtles. Most of the time the heroes fight adversaries born of science and industry rather than magic. Even when magic does show up, the way they deal with it tends to be more about exploiting logical rules than narrative weaknesses like in many fantasy stories. I think I may have stumbled upon a under-explored genre, urban sci-fi.

  The purpose of urban fantasy is to bring fantasy worlds into our own, often at a local/personal level. It's a similar kind of escapism as fantasy, but is designed to relate to the reader's life more directly by drawing direct parallels between the fantasy world and real world. Few stories seem to have tried the same with sci-fi and I think more should. It may help breathe new life into a tired formula, while having just as much potential for interesting adventures.

  It's easy enough to make sci-fi analogs to, say, The Dresden Files. Wizards are savant geniuses, human-like creatures are mutants, inhuman creatures are robots, The Fair Folk are aliens, and minor gods are AIs. The dreaded Masquerade is completely optional since even if people keep weird stuff a secret they'd still be willing and able use it for something eventually. The whole point of sci-fi is to challenge the status quo, so there's no need to protect it from unearthly influence.

  It might be difficult to rationalize evil use of science. It's easy enough for dark wizards to inflict mayhem and horrors upon the world, but how do scientists and engineers do it? For that matter, how could an evil corporation do it? The real R&D field is pretty heavily regulated and there's so much money to be made legally that no one wants to commit crimes or let projects get out of control. I don't think we should just wave our hands like we do with gadgeteer heroes and mad scientists.

    I don't think you should feel guilty for empathising with someone whose conclusions you strongly dislike. You said that "The fact that I didn't implicitly hate such casual homophobia using distorted religious doctrine as justification, when I am a religious liberal myself, makes me question just how morally upstanding I am."

    Does your system of morality really require you to hate people with substantially different beliefs to you? Does it even require you to hate their beliefs? Why is it a betrayal not to get angry at his viewpoints, and instead to empathise with them without accepting them? What are the principles that you're upholding by hating this man or being angry at what he believes?

    Personally, I consider the ability to empathise with opposing viewpoints to be a moral good, not bad. The sad truth of the world is, most people believe they're in the right. Pro-life people believe they're advocating against the murder of unborn children, while pro-choice people believe they're advocating for women's autonomy. And they're both right.

    Both sides consider the other monstrous because they lack this empathy you're displaying. If you're pro-life, pro-choice people want to murder babies because it's convenient. If you're pro-choice, pro-life people hate women and want to remove their choices. The counter to such skewed viewpoints is the ability to empathise with the other side - even if their argument is wrong.

      Does he deserve empathy, though? He explicitly said that he wants to impose his arbitrary rules upon myself and used illogical arguments to back up his point (he believes America was founded on "Christian principles"). I countered his casual insistence that I deserve to be discriminated against not by pointing out why his actions were reprehensible, but by attempting to uncover inconsistencies in his beliefs that he refused to acknowledge. 

      I couldn't even reason with him the way I'm supposed to because I was too stupid to think of better arguments in the moment. His rebuttals were contradictory, but I didn't point that out because I thought he wouldn't listen to such statements and he ended up ignoring my logic anyway. I didn't even try to convince him that sexuality wasn't a choice or remind him to "love thy neighbor", I just kept giving ground to him hoping that I'd find an exploitable opening but he was too good at mental gymnastics.

      I put on a shameful performance for a morality debate because I was afraid of alienating him by explicitly contradicting his beliefs, when the mere fact that I wasn't a conservative Christian was probably enough for him to not bother listening. I completely failed to assess the situation and now he will continue to commit injustices believing them to be virtuous, while days later I see pictures of same-sex couple and think the disgust bigots would feel instead of feeling happiness of seeing symbols of acceptance.

      I failed at arguing about morals, my dwelling on that failure is interfering with my moral instincts, and I shouldn't even care because choosing to discriminate against LGBT people is a repulsive choice. The fact that I don't feel disgust towards this person's beliefs, and the fact that I was concerned about alienating him when he probably wouldn't care anyway, makes me question how much conviction I have. I was tolerant of someone who is intolerant of me when I should've been righteously indignant at a violation of the social contract.

        Are you very libertarian?  If not, you probably commit a similar sin somewhere in your own political/philosophical beliefs.  Should people who strongly disagree then hate you for it?  If not, then you certainly don't need to hate yourself here.

        > couldn't even reason with him the way I'm supposed to because I was too stupid to think of better arguments in the moment.

        I feel for you here.  I am *terrible* at in-person arguments like this, so I generally just avoid the topic as much as possible (much harder this past election cycle!), smile, make a generic, noncommittal response, then go argue about it online later.

        The problem with your strategy is that it's too much playing the long game.  It would probably be a good tact to take if you two were locked in a room and had months to argue it out.  In the heat of a relatively fleeting encounter, you'd be better served seeking a line that would short-circuit his train of thought.  "Why would a god who loves me make me this way just to suffer?  And besides, the Covenant of Christ supersedes the Covenant of Moses, so all that anti-gay stuff is just for historical reasons, it's no part of Christ's teachings."

        >while days later I see pictures of same-sex couple and think the disgust bigots would feel instead of feeling happiness of seeing symbols of acceptance.

        Umm, please take this in the charitable desire to be helpful it's intended, but are you perhaps just incredibly impressionable?  Taking on someone's implicit beliefs after a mere day of association, and having it last multiple days is very unusual.

          I was dwelling on that mindset because I hadn't found closure for my mistake. I've always been very good at putting myself in someone else's headspace, I was just lingering in that one when I didn't want to because my feelings on the matter were unresolved. Now that I've talked it out here, my intuitive reactions are back to normal.
          ```

      - u/Salivanth:
        ```
        I don't think you made a poor argument because you empathised with his position. It seems you made a poor argument because:

        - You didn't want to explicitly contradict him, out of politeness. This hamstrung your ability to argue with him.

        - In-person arguments are really hard.

        The ability to empathise is a crucial tool for changing people's minds. To go back to the pro-life vs. pro-choice example, both sides are generally TERRIBLE at convincing the other side.

        Pro-life: "Abortion is murder, you're murdering a baby just because you don't want to carry it to term, and that's a horrible thing to do." 

        Pro-choice: "If you don't want an abortion, don't have one. You have the right to your choice, and I have the right to mine."

        Except those arguments are terrible, because they don't address what the other side *actually believes*. "Don't murder babies" is not a good argument for the pro-life side, because their opponents don't believe it's murder. They'd be better off convincing the pro-choice side that life does, in fact, begin at conception. If they could do that, the pro-choice advocate would agree with almost all their other points immediately.

        Similarly, the pro-choice argument of "If you don't want an abortion, don't have one" is terrible, because pro-life advocates believe abortion is murder. "If you don't want babies murdered, don't murder them" is hardly a good argument, but that's what it sounds like to the pro-life side. The pro-choice side would be better off trying to convince the pro-life side that life doesn't begin at conception after all.

        Similarly, it seems your homophobe has a different prior to you, which is causing him to behave logically from his perspective. "Homosexuality is both a sin and a choice" is his prior. It's wrong, but it's what he believes. Given that viewpoint, a lot of his actions make perfect sense.

        This means that homosexuals are going to hell...so you would naturally try to convince them they should stop. You would probably be civil to them (as he was to you) and wouldn't go around calling them faggots or beating the shit out of them. But you probably wouldn't be a fan of gay marriage or gay pride parades - that's legitimising a lifestyle that causes people to be eternally damned. 

        If you want to argue effectively against a position, you do have to empathise with it to some degree - at least enough to treat your opponents as human, rather than The Other who believes horrific things for no reason, like that we should murder babies if we're too lazy to carry them any more, or that we should subjugate women's rights because we're cartoon-supervillain level misogynists.

        Aren't all sentients do? Would you sympathize with a tortured inhuman alien? With an AGI? With a paperclipper? If so, not sympathizing with unpleasant humans, and *only* with unpleasant humans, seems oddly specific and inconsistent.

        Personally, however arrogant that is, I can't help but think of such people as children who can't really be responsible for their actions and beliefs. They deserve to be either pitied or not taken serioulsy, but actually *hating* them seems silly to me: they just don't know any better. They could learn, they could be *taught*, but wasting time trying to do that to every grown child you encounter while they try to deny you with all they have is an exercise in futility.

        I know that it's an extremely dubious standpoint bordering on dehumanization (ironically), so feel free to discard it.

          Well, I would sympathize with them if an injustice was perpetrated against them. I've never wished violence on a person no matter how reprehensible. I don't even like revenge stories, I find The Punisher unbearably boring as anything other than a antagonist.

          I agree with you intellectually, though I'm uncertain from an emotional perspective. The thing about children, though, is that while they must be disciplined when they refuse to listen. When I cannot discipline someone for refusing to learn, I feel frustrated and it makes me doubt what I'm doing.
          ```

          - u/Noumero:
            ```
            Humanity has too many children and too few people who could be at least *considered* adult. As such, the more rational people can't be disciplining everyone all the time, or they simply won't have time for *anything* else, so most of the "children" are running around unattended. I can absolutely understand being frustrated at it, though since I myself have long lost that feeling, I can't offer any advice. Try to limit engaging with them unless you think you have a good chance of changing their mind or it's a *really* crucial issue?

    "Love good, hate evil" is a religious doctrine.  Does it do more good to hate someone for views you find wrong, but within the scope of empathy?  Or is that just virtue-signaling to yourself?  Where's the virtue in hating someone for getting the facts wrong?

    >The real R&D field is pretty heavily regulated and there's so much money to be made legally that no one wants to commit crimes or let projects get out of control.

    There's a whole lot of money made in committing certain kinds of crimes.  Hacking, war crimes, surveillance, counter-surveillance, anti-surveillance, bank robbery (*Ocean's 11*, for instance).  Lots of stuff you can come up with.

      The problem isn't so much finding reasons for individuals to commit crimes, but to create a trend of it. I'm trying to avoid Cut Lex Luthor a Check, why would so many people (usually educated scientists and engineers) specifically choose to use their creations to commit crimes when they could just make a ton of money legitimately? It's not like no one would pay them.

      I like heists as much as the next guy, but explicit theft is uncommon among well-off people. Espionage is more plausible, but would require the story to be a conspiracy thriller. I'd prefer to leave it open for a Monster/Case of the Week formula, which means criminals have access to gadgets, experiments are escaping, and projects are being stolen.

      It's not that White Collar crime isn't interesting, I actually think it's so interesting that there's no point in exploring it in a sci-fi adventure. There has to be an economic reason why people in the R&D sector aren't doing legitimate work in the public eye...I've got it, aliens cause a economic crisis!

      I already figured aliens would be in this setting, so if they had access to technology beyond anything humans have and countries considered trading with them, that would throw whole industries into disarray. Investors pull out so the people get laid off and have to take their work home or on the street.

      The people still working for a company would become desperate enough to seize any advantage they could. Risky projects are approved with cuts to the budget and staff, competitors are sabotaged at any cost, and illegal conspiracies would be supported to influence or delay trade treaties.

      The antagonists are trying to maintain what relevance and financial security they can while they still have a chance. I could even explain the prior buildup of weird science as a military-industrial complex fighting unruly aliens, but now their more civilized opponents have shown up and are out-bidding the human lobbyists.

    You're morally fine.

    Imagine I'm talking to an Anti-Vaxxer.  I'd vehemently disagree with their policy suggestions.  I think they doom children to horrible pointless deaths. 

    But I don't hate them.  I don't even disagree with their moral position.

    Instead, my logic is:

    1.  We ought do what's good for children.
    2.  Vaccines are net-good.
    3.  So we ought vaccinate children.

    Their logic is:

    1.  We ought do what's good for children.
    2.  Vaccines are net-bad.
    3.  So we ought not vaccinate children.

    Our morality is entirely contained in the first statement.  And we fundamentally agree on that.  Our conflict emerges from our beliefs about facts.

    The anti-vaxxer is mistaken.  Tragically so.  With terrible consequences.  But wrong isn't the same as evil.

    You're in a similar spot. Both you and your opponent want to do things that promote human flourishing.  And you both care enough about others that you'll put effort into advocacy.  That's the core moral question.

    Your coworker is wrong about what creates a healthy society.  His mistake is tragic.  And it could lead him to advocate things with terrible consequences.  But you sensed that he's doing harm with good intentions.  So he's mistaken, not evil.

    On a tangent:

    I smile when people talk about "taking the bible literally."  It makes me want to meet the Literalist Christians.

    I don't mean Christians who take Genesis seriously, or think that Jesus wanted them to give their possessions to the poor.  No, I want to meet the person who reads Song of Solomon 1:15:

    > Behold, you are beautiful, my love; behold, you are beautiful; your eyes are doves.

    And recoils in confused horror.  

    Or understands Song of Solomon 2:9:

    > You have captivated my heart, my sister, my bride; you have captivated my heart with one glance of your eyes, with one jewel of your necklace.

    To be a dire warning against getting into an incestuous relationship with a sorceress.  How did that poor guy retrieve his heart from her gemstones!

    Literalism would make many of Jesus's teachings all that much more complicated.  "Jesus," the disciples might ask, "why are you always telling that story about the time that woman lost a coin?  Should we sabotage coin purses, so angels can rejoice more often as people find their money?"

    ---

    I do a similar thing when people talk about "9/11 conspiracy theorists."

    I hold the standard conspiracy-theorist view.  I think a dozen-or-so people met in secret, planned a criminal act, and then took steps towards committing that act.  Conspiracy.

    I've met people who advocated a less-plausible theory where government officials met in secret, planned a criminal act, and then took steps to commit it.  Odd.  But also a conspiracy.

    But i really want to meet the guy who's ruled out any kind of secret, unlawful coordination between individuals.

    So! Gargoyles.

    Funny you should mention them. I have one as a minor character in the novella I just recently co-wrote and am now editing (anyone want to be a beta reader? /u/callmebrotherg , were you still interested in giving it a look or do you not have time to give feedback for 50,000 words of content on a volunteer basis?). 

    I've never actually seen the eponymous TV series, and since my vampires are different, my gargoyle is naturally different too. We went with a gargoyle because we wanted a "statue/human" duality type thing - he's a statue sometimes, human other times. His job is to protect his "master" and he has blue and orange morality due to that, but he also has a family, a son, etc. 

    I'm not sure why the concept of gargoyles isn't more explored. I think the stone being trope is cool, but golems aren't explored either.

    - u/trekie140:
      ```
      I recommend the show if you like action adventure cartoons, kind of like TMNT, but the plot and characters are generally more intelligent than most cartoons from the time. In the show, gargoyles turn to stone breakable by a sledgehammer during the day (even if they're underground), have the strength to bend steel and leap 10 ft into the air, claws that cut through stone, tails prehensile enough to trip people, and wings that let them glide on air currents. However, they aren't much more durable than regular humans.

      The show focused more on the way they interact with humans who fear or want to exploit them, but it is stated that gargoyles have a strong instinct to protect the land they call home. It's a bit vague just how strong that instinct is since it's really used to justify why they don't tend to run away from danger and most of them seem to like fighting crime, though those could be due to standard character traits or cultural norms.

    I'm super late to this discussion but I just wanna say that i definitely empathize with *you*, /u/trekie140. I recently had an argument in a related vein with my religious mother about America, more specifically Donald Trump. She tried to give me the whole "America was founded on Christian values; look how great it is" to justify why Trump, despite all of the blatantly *idiotic* shit he's done, is doing a decent job so far. Apparently (I haven't researched this, so I took her at her word), he's made some decisions that conservative Christians really approve of recently, as far as certain laws go. 

    I continue to be in jaw dropping awe of how my mother can support this guy. I went on to expound on how, just because America has "In God We Trust" on its money and God is mentioned in the Constitution doesn't mean its entire success is predicated on its "Christian" values. She would refuse my logic and ask me questions like "So how is a country being founded on such values bad?" and when I give several examples about how theocracies have *sucked*, she ignores my points or moves onto another point. It felt like I was landing free throws, only for my opponent to ignore the scoreboard and stubbornly claim they're winning. 

    Anyway. Sorry for the rant about me, me, me. But I get you; it's frustrating to argue with someone that you know (and by know I mean, you can pretty much empirically prove) is wrong. Some people refuse to be swayed by logic and I find that religious people are very much this way. It takes a certain amount of stubbornness to be religious in modern society and this shows in arguments with them. I have no trouble with people being religious; believe what you want, do what you want with yourself and your choices and pray to whatever deity(ies) you believe in. But when those beliefs start spilling over into areas that affect others and infringe on others' rights to not be **fucking sheep**, I have an issue. 

    At the end of the day, OP, you're a good person for empathizing. There can't be any understanding without some amount of empathy. You can't come to any sort of agreement with a non like minded individual if you're not willing to emotionally invest to some degree. Otherwise we'd all just be caught in never ending cycles of violence and anger and nothing would get accomplished. Empathizing with someone is the emotional equivalent to sitting a child down and asking them "Why do you think it was ok to push Suzy down" as opposed to simply striking them and telling them not to do it again. While you *may* get the child to stop pushing Suzy down with the latter option, you haven't helped that child in the long run. That child isn't a more understanding and mature person that slowly learns to care about not harming others. He's simply afraid of you and will restrain himself in your presence. This isn't about my being for or against physical punishment of children; I'm more so saying any sort of punitive action should have a component of empathy and respect. Otherwise the person in question won't grow and change for the better. It takes a big man (or woman) to do that with someone who's so fundamentally different from a moral standpoint. In my own little internet, reddit, r/rational community member way, I'm proud of you. 

    **TL;DR: My mom supports Trump, wtf. Arguing with religious people about topics related to their religion can be infuriatingly cyclical and pointless. They should keep their theological beliefs out of anything that affects other people, such as state wide legislation. Your empathy is a strength and something to be proud of, not ashamed of. It's the most important step towards mutual understanding.**

    I don't think that's a problem. You looked at the point of view of a person whose point of view was opposed to yours. You engaged him in debate, listening and *genuinely considering* the benefits of his viewpoint. After doing so, you looked at the situation and decided to stick with your original viewpoint. And not for irrational, tribalistic my-tribe-is-always-right rules (at least, I assume not) but because you really thought, after considering the opposite viewpoint, that your original viewpoint was *right*.

    That all seems well and good to me. I don't think it would have been any better to have rejected him out-of-hand.

    Consider it the other way around; when debating with this colleague, would you have preferred him to argue as you did - considering your viewpoint, thinking about it, and so on - or would you have preferred him to reject you out-of-hand?

  **[WARNING: EXISTENTIAL CRISIS]**

  ___

  People here were debating politics recently, talked about how recent developments have them truly *hating* their political opposition, as much as they hated themselves for hating.

  Well, I'm pretty apathetic towards politics. Perhaps *fatalistic*, even, as much as that concept disgusts me.

  I don't believe humanity is going to survive this century, or *humanity as we know it* at the very least. Most likely, a global nuclear war will ensue, and humanity will be returned to the Stone Age. Perhaps our next civilization, built from the ashes of this one, will fare better. Probably not, though: we will be repeatedly driving themselves to near-extinction, destroying the civilzation over and over, until we finally succeed and kill ourselves.

  The alternatives seem worse.

  Artifical intelligences become more and more sophisticated. Unless *one* competent and benevolent group of researches gets far ahead of the others, there will be a race to finish and activate our first and last AGI. Some, or should I say *most*, of the participants of this race would be either insufficiently competent (if there even *is* such a thing as "sufficiently competent" in these matters), or evil/misaligned. Military AGIs, ideological AGIs, terrorist AGIs, whatever. The odds of a FAI group winning are low, the odds of it *succeeding* in these conditions (as opposed to rushing and making a mistake in the code) are lower. As such, if humanity activates an AGI, it will most likely erase us all, or create hell on Earth if the winner is a would-be-FAI with a subtle mistake in utility function. MIRI tries to avert it, but would it really be able to influence government research and such firmly enough, when the time comes?

  Of course, AGI creation may be impossible in the near future. If it's neither AGI nor mere nukes... 

  Humans are barely capable of handling what technology we already developed: pollution, global warming left unchecked, the ever-present nuclear threat. When we'll get to nanomachines, advanced bioengineering, cyborgization, human uploading? Most likely, we'll cause an omnicide, possibly taking all of Earth or all of the Solar System with us. If we're not so lucky, it's either a dystopia with absolute and unopposable surveillance the cyberpunk warned us about, or a complete victory of [Moloch](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/), with everything we value being sacrificed to be more productive and earn the right to exist.

  Interstellar travel and colonization of other planets would merely make it worse. The concept of an actual star war with billions or trillions dying is probably worse than almost anything else, so it's pretty good we're probably not going to get that far.

  Recent political developments aren't particularly reassuring. If neither of these things happens, global situation will merely continue to deteriorate. Global-scale economic collapse, new Dark Ages? A non-nuclear World War Three? Even so, we won't be stagnant forever. Would the post-new-Dark-Ages humanity be better at preventing existential threats as described above? Doubt it.

  In short, entropy wins here, as it does: the list of Bad Ends is much longer than the list of Happy Ends, so a Bad End is much more likely.

  Being outraged at Trump or whoever seems so pointless and petty, in the face of that.

  I don't even think it could be *fixed*, I'm just, as someone in the abovementioned thread had said, "ranting about gravity". Yes, there's such things as CFAR that try to make humans more reasonable on average, and some influential people are concerned about humanity's future as well, but I fear it may be far too little far too late.

  (Brief digression: the most funny thing is, even *if* we succeed in AGI or somehow prosper without it, older aliens or older uFAIs they set loose would most likely do us in *anyway*. Not to mention the Heat Death...)

  And if we're not going to last, what was the point? To enjoy what happiness we've had? Nonsense. Our history wasn't exactly a happy one, not even a *net positive*, far from a net positive. If only we've succeed in creating eternal utopia, it would've all been worth it, but... If humanity isn't going to last, if everything we value, everything we've accomplished and everyone we know are going to be simply erased, there was no fucking point at all. Will humanity have lived in pain for millenia, only to have a moment's respite right before death? If so, it would've been better off never existing.

  Am I wrong anywhere? I very much hope so.

  ___

  Before you ask: no, I'm pretty sure I am not depressed. I'm usually pretty happy with my life, I just honestly don't see us lasting, logically, and don't see what the point is then, global-scale. I'm proud of what humanity has managed to accomplish, and I loathe the universe for setting us up to fall.

    >what was the point

    ---

    *Disclaimer one: these are just my current opinions on this.*

    *Disclaimer two: this isn’t intended as a complete answer, more like a continuation \ contribution to the discussion.*

    ---

    TL;DR: The world doesn’t care about creating meaning that humans would judge and find satisfactory — humans assign meanings for themselves.

    If you tie your (life’s, worldview’s) meaning to things like reaching a utopia or ending *all* suffering in the world, it will not survive due to the systematic problems you’ve mentioned (akin to trying to maintain faith in an omnibenevolent and omnipotent being, etc). Choosing a more modest meaning — for example, “making my here-and-now enjoyable and preventing the gradual degradation of my here-and-now into an existence of suffering” — at least won’t leave you with unfixable logical contradictions. You can play with various definitions to find the most complicated and ambitious one that both suits you and doesn’t fall apart under the laws of our universe. 

    Also, some un-ordered bullet-points that either support my previous two paragraphs or are just somehow relevant to something else from your comment:

    * all-encompassing surveillance isn’t by itself a bad thing, since it can serve as one of very few possible tools for averting many of the Bed Ends. The real problem is how to build a political system that won’t be abusing such surveillance capabilities and won’t turn into draconian totalitarian regime that cares about itself and its elite more than the general happiness of its population.
    * our current morality and views on what is normal and what is dystopian are subjective to our civilization, they will likely die with us and get replaced with a new frame of standards if our civilization fails to survive.
    * similarly, seeing suffering as something bad is subjective to humanity — other animals mostly don’t care about inflicting suffering (e.g. eating prey alive), and the universe in general doesn’t care about allowing systems that generate suffering.
     * that being said, the only way I see [the propagation of human suffering through space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen_of_the_Galaxy) possibly curtailed is through a new world order ([cue conspirologists)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW7Op86ox9g) with total surveillance and some current human rights rescinded.
    * the world doesn’t revolve around humanity — maybe we’ll become obsolete, maybe we’ll change into something else, maybe we’ll just destroy ourselves; and the universe will keep going, with likely some other alien species spawning up somewhere else and having to deal with the same set of rules derived from laws of the universe, entropy, the principles of evolution, etc
    * most of the problems you mention are not unsolvable *in principle*. That is, they are not reliant directly on the laws of nature but rather on the laws of human psychology. I have no idea what can be done to change the psychology of 7+ billion people though. 
     * as an example, Gorkavyi [in his books (RU)](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3494893) solved that partially through an almost-omnipresent benevolent AI and partially through a deus ex machina of making his protagonists into billionaires. Maybe IRL something like that could work as a group effort spearheaded by several very influential people, if the friendly AI attempt lands on a natural 20.  
    * I recommend you reading [*the Doc Future trilogy.*](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Sandbox/DocFuture) It doesn’t give any answers to the problem of multitude of likely Bad Ends (not ones that would work in real world anyway), but the problem itself still plays a major part in the storyline and narrative, and so you may find the story interesting.

    - u/Noumero:

      Yes, there's no objective meaning to existence — not even a meaning that could be shared by all humans — so that part is indeed subjective to me. But I think there could be a human-universal *utility* of life/[CEV](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Coherent_Extrapolated_Volition); we can agree that bringing children into the world only to torture them for fifty years is morally abhorrent, and we can multiply. We could in theory calculate the total net utility of humanity's existence throughout all of history, and what I claim is that it's going to be *negative* if we all die/be enslaved within this century. Hence the "no point"/"better off never existing", since the value of not-existing is zero. I don't see how impermanence and not-universality of our values help, here.

    > I just honestly don't see us lasting, logically, and don't see what the point is then, global-scale.

    But more seriously... I'm not sure this is the right view to take?  That is, if every time T is justified by the things that come causally downstream of it, doesn't this sort of turn into an inductive (or open-ball) proof with no base-case (no point around which to form the ball)?  Should the Big Bang require moral justification by the heat-death of the universe?

    From my point of view, you could tell me that ten years from now, the world would completely change, and everything would be perfect.  I'd still tell you that my life right now kinda sucks, for all kinds of mixed-up personal reasons.  It's nice to think that the integral of our entire causal trajectory adds up to something positive, but the individual points still have their own individual values.

    >I loathe the universe for setting us up to fall.

    The universe didn't set us up for anything.  It set us up to be the exactly the creatures we are, which means that to wish the universe had been otherwise is to wish *you* had been otherwise.  Sure, you can wish that, but how do you suppose nature is supposed to cough you up precisely in some better way?

    As to much of the rest, I have to reboot my computer and go see a friend for the evening.  I'll write more later.  Unfortunately, your prognosis is at least mostly accurate, but that doesn't really change the set of actions available to us.  We still have to do what we can do to ensure that the world *isn't* totally destroyed, by boring or interesting means.

    I disagree.

    Just because there's more bad than good doesn't extinguish the good. The fact that it even exists at all is miraculous. I really don't get that line of thought, that because we're so small or that because we've gone through so much that whatever good there has ever been wasn't worth it. Sure, 

    Listen, I mainly lurk this sub to find good stories. I don't really get involved with political debates or talks about where we will go as a species. I'll admit, I get lost whenever I see stuff like that. But there's always something that bothers me whenever I see pretty much any discussion about very big things like politics.

    Noone really acknowledges how little they actually know about the situation.

    I've seen people act like they know exactly where the world is going to go, they create there own little model of the world. But that model is undeniably biased by their own experiences. If someone has only seen the horrors of war, they're probably going to have a much more violent notion of where we'll all end up. If someone's in power they'll see how they effected the world and only focus on things they had a hand in. And this perspective has helped them succeed in life, so how could it possibly be wrong?

    Envisioning the future is a lot harder than people like to think it is. The fact that we've gone so far in the last few centuries is insane. Would someone 300 years ago predicted that we'd end up here? Talking to each other from across the world near instantaneously? No, because they have no notion that something like this can exist. Their life experiences say this is impossible, and they succeeded in life so how could it be wrong?

    I just think anyone that thinks they know where we're going as a species is probably wrong. Who knows, maybe in a few thousand years we'll find out something about the universe that completely changes the game?

    I'm not going to lie and say I'm someone who has the answers because I don't. I'm just another person in a sea of people who've probably articulated what I wanted to get across much better. I'm just someone who's looking at the world through a perspective shaped by it. And that perspective has led me to believe that, in nearly every case, I'm probably wrong. I might just be projecting honestly, I don't know.

    Everyone has their own perspective, and most of the time they have it because it works. Because it hasn't let them down yet. And people with fluid perspectives are just the same too, they can accept other viewpoints of the world because they've found that that way of looking at things works.

    Also speculation regarding thermonuclear war, I doubt it will actually happen. Many people forget this but the people in power aren't fucking stupid. At least the ones with the most power anyway. Also they're human. They aren't some faceless enemy that needs to be overcome, they're just humans with more money and/or connections. Noone actually wants the world to be destroyed, so even if they inadvertently set something off that could kill us all,  someone's gonna catch on. I don't know if they'll succeed or not but damned if they don't try. In terms of AGI, do you really think people are going to let that happen? Literally everyone is going to have protections against both the ones they create and other countries. Actual crazy people aren't gonna create the first AGI. And by the time they can, there's going to be protection against that. This is wiled speculation that's probably wrong, but its the best I can come up with. I'm aware of the hypocrisy of predicting the future after what I said yes. I'm just offering my personal perspective and I would not at all be surprised if I was completely off mark. If you you think I'm deflecting criticism by saying whatever I want than adding "but I'm probably wrong" like some sort of safety blanket... I don't know what to say. Maybe I am. I don't know.

      >Just because there's more bad than good doesn't extinguish the good. 

      It doesn't, but does *any* amount of good justifies *any* amount of bad? Someone was tortured for fifty years, then was shown an entertaining 5-minute video before being killed. Was it worth it? Are you sure humanity is not in such situation?

      >I've seen people act like they know exactly where the world is going to go, they create there own little model of the world. But that model is undeniably biased by their own experiences

      Well, yes, of course. I'm just speculating based on my best understanding of the situation, as well. I can't predict unexpected breakthroughs or discoveries, but some general trends, such as technological progress or political changes, seem apparent, so I assume they would stay unchanged and try to imagine broadly what happens. I could be wrong; I *hope* I'm wrong, I even said as much.

      But so what? *Not* think about the future at all? That's exactly how many of these existential threats wipe us out, *if* they ever become actual. Better prepare and then be proven wrong than not prepare.

      >Many people forget this but the people in power aren't fucking stupid. At least the ones with the most power anyway. Also they're human

      Exactly. They're human, prone to making mistakes and being impulsive, some more than others. Some could think it's better to die than let the Enemy win, some are bad at understanding long-term consequences, some may misjudge their weapons' or defenses' capabilities, etc. Not very likely to happen, but likely *enough*.

      >In terms of AGI, do you really think people are going to let that happen? Literally everyone is going to have protections against both the ones they create and other countries

      The protections may turn out to not be advanced enough.

      > If you you think I'm deflecting criticism by saying whatever I want than adding "but I'm probably wrong" like some sort of safety blanket... 

      Nah. I don't see what's wrong with safety blankets.

    For me it's a matter of perspective. 


    As you put it, we may well be living in the most pivotal time in human existence, with myriad bad ends available to us. Personally, I find this inspiring. We aren't just witnesses to the future coming into being, we can also influence​ how it plays out. I'm filled with purpose by the thought of being able to nudge humanity a little closer to a better future, and I intend to live my life with that goal in mind. 


    (Potential extinction or worse is also all the more reason to make the most of the superstimuli this century has to offer)


    I'm in agreement on pettiness and outrage, I find it quite liberating to be able to dismiss the latest insignificant controversies and not bother having any strong feelings about them. 


    As for ranting about gravity, it's important to be able to recognise that there is an issue to be overcome. That's one step on the way to space travel :P


    Humanity probably does have a long series of existential hurdles ahead. All we can do is to leap over ours, and trust in our successors to handle the next one. We haven't failed so far!


    We can't change history and avert all the suffering that has already occurred, but we can mitigate the pains of the present and the future. I think that's a worthy aim, regardless of whether we'll be going extinct in a hundred years or a billion. Besides, unless you think suffering is infinitely worse than happiness is good, we wouldn't need an eternal utopia. I'm sure a million years would be more than enough to pay off our utilon debt to the past :P

    Every so often, I see a story with the message that death gives life meaning, that the limits on our time here and the fact that we can't do everything is what makes what we do meaningful and beautiful.

    I heartily disagree.  Life is beautiful, inherently.  I will resist my own death as much as I am able, and my accomplishments are no less meaningful because I seek immortality.  If I saw anything beneficial in death, I would be planning to take my own life as soon as the benefits outweighed the downside of being dead.

    I see a similar perspective from you, that death strips life of meaning, that life is not beautiful unless it is immortal.  It's the polar opposite of the perspective above, but shares common facets.  For instance, if I held this perspective and believed I would not be immortal, then my life has no meaning and everything I do is meaningless and there's no reason to *not* kill myself and just cut out the middleman.

    I heartily disagree with this too.  Life is beautiful, period.  I want life to last as long as possible, and when someone dies it's a horrible tragedy that we as a society have been forced to accept for the sake of our sanity, but while they lived their life and love and joy made the world brighter.  Even the saddest example of a human being who knows neither love or joy makes the world a little brighter, in my eyes.

    If there is a part of this that you will disagree with, I expect it would be this, because I say these things out of a fundamental conviction, which isn't something that can one can just convince someone else of.  But it stands that I see life, in general and in specific, as net-positive, that even if the world and everything on it is obliterated today it was still worth it, that there is no suffering worse than death and everyone who has ever lived has brought a little bit of light to the world, even if some are net-dim by ending other lights.

    As for our future, I choose not to be fatalist because being fatalist is not useful in any way.  If AI is destined to consume the world and delete human life, if we use all our nukes and all human progress evaporates, even if Moloch gets the last laugh and there is little *human* about Earth anymore, we accomplish nothing by deciding this is inevitable.  It may seem a little anti-truth, that I would not consider a fatalistic viewpoint even if there were no other reasonable conclusion, but when you weigh the outcomes, me and others like me being non-fatalistic has a slight chance of preventing the bad end where being fatalistic accomplishes nothing.

    I can be convinced that the world *might* be doomed, that Moloch has opened its ugly jaws and wishes to swallow us whole or that the first AI is most likely going to be unfriendly, but knowing that is useful, since I can dedicate my efforts towards helping the human cause.

      The belief that life is meaningless unless it is immortal is an extreme example of my beliefs, and [it appears to not be consistent](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6g8z4s/d_friday_offtopic_thread/diponag/), in the light of some statements here.

      I still think that non-eternal existence and death, even by the Heat Death, would make humanity frustratingly insignificant in the grand scheme of things, but not exactly *meaningless*.

      I disagree that life is beautiful by definition, I would prefer omnicide to Moloch's victory, but it indeed seems to be a fundamental disagreement.

    Humanity - *life*, in fact, life as a whole - lives, and has always lived, in a delicate balance along the edge of disaster. At any point, over millions of years, people have had the ability to stand up, look proudly over the horizon, and say "What's that thing in the sky and why is it getting bigger?"

    Volcanos, earthquakes, tsunamis would not kill of humanity as a *whole* - but they would certainly kill off a village, a city, even at times an entire civilisation. And rocks from the sky - those could kill of an entire *ecology*. (And have. Look at what happened to the dinosaurs). Life is a delicate balance on the edge of utter disaster - in the face of the laws of thermodynamics, life only *exists* because it's near to a massive great big energy source that's radiating out like anything.

    And sometimes, the danger really *is* planet-destroying. Consider the Cold War. An entire generation more or less grew up under the everpresent threat of a war of mutual nuclear annihilation.

    You're right that the list of Bad Ends is much, much longer than the list of Happy Ends. But, I put it to you, this is nothing *new*. This has already been the case for multiple millenia - for the entirety of not only mere *human* history, but for the entire span of the history of *life on Earth* as a whole. What's changed, since early bacteria managed to avoid death in a burst of volcanic fury?

    Three things, I think, have changed. The first is that some of these dangers have been mitigated. Reduced. It's now a lot harder for us to be hit by a meteor and wiped out that way - meteors can be seen, predicted, and, in extreme situations, *deflected*.

    The second is that other forms of annihilation have become more likely. Ending the world in a nuclear winter is more likely now than it was ten million years ago. These two changes, to some degree, cancel each other out.

    The third difference is that you (and other people, too) are now more *aware* of these dangers. Your great-great-great-great grandfather might not have known what an AGI was, but you do. You can *see* the danger coming; this makes it more likely that you, and others, can take steps to make it less likely. (But never impossible, no. Never, ever, ever impossible. Even as it is now, a piece of unexpected rock travelling as a sufficient fraction of the speed of light won't even be seen before it punches a hole right through the planet and out the other side.) It's not the sudden influx of danger that makes things look worse now than they used to look. No, it's the sudden influx of *awareness*.

    And... then you ask what the point of humanity is. I have my theories, but that's all they are - guesses, ideas. I don't know with complete certainty.

    But I do think it will be interesting to find out.

  Recently got my copy of the boardgame High frontier third edition. Its a spaceflight simulation /near future space colonisation game.

  Infamous for being ridiculously complex, you have to track mass,fuel,DeltaV and orbits time while flying on [this solar system map](http://i.imgur.com/Oj5XfO5.jpg).  New recruits first fly base game, then you can start to add two different equally hard modules -  and if that doesnt satisfy your spaceflight thirst you can end a game with all modules by changing to an interstellar map and trying your hand at colonizing other planets with your ingame built starship. 

  Really something for space nerds, and unfortunaltely *already* sold out again, only  a couple weeks after the kickstarter. But comes highly recommended from this space nerd. 

  Can be played online with the boardgame engine VASSAL, altough it takes away much of the experience.

    Bonus random fanboy/girl features from the game, for example far future features that the second half of the modules gives access to: 

    - Using vatican transhuman eugenic pilgrims to destroy the heretics on earth via asteroid, ending the game

    - crashing an asteroid into venus, terraforming it

    - creating AI, with the risk of immediately killing all humans

    - emancipating the robots 

    - building space elevators on pluto and its moon charon 

    - building a colony ship out of the gas giants via fusion candle 

    - first expansion module allows flying around with legendary Orion nuclear explosion engine https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Orion_(nuclear_propulsion)

    - The game cards consist of lovely blueprints of actual existing patents/studies, like [so](https://sites.google.com/site/calvinuslab/_/rsrc/1342086994710/high-frontier/high-frontier-play-by-email-game-two/HF-Game-2Bas-1-Markets.jpg?width=100%25). Game rules are 46 pages long; there are an additional 45(!) pages with technical background, design notes, and references to all the studies/patents.
