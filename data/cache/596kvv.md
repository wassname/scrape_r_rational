  This manga is super intense for me.

  [I bet that it will turn out that ](#s "Ray decided to pretend to be a spy to feed the adults fake information, but didn't tell Emma and Norman to ensure they didn't accidentally give away information.")

    I agree. [I called it weeks ago.](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/52gmxb/rt_the_promised_neverland_006/d7lfor3/?context=3) It's a such a typical shounen move. I'm dissapointed, to be honest.

  If they were paranoid enough they would have checked if Ray was an spy a long time ago, especially because he believed them too easily .I don't think he is the spy , although they have reasons to suspect him, he has shown that he is  capable of at least try to abandon  the other kids and probably the trap   was also for Ray, maybe Norman told him something different from what he told the other two  so the trap was also for him ( or he didn't do that but is going to bluff and try to get a reaction from Ray .Probably Norman is suspicious of Ray because he thinks Ray is  capable of betraying them if he sees their chances Of surviving very low  .
