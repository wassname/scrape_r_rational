## Looking For Story

### Post:

Itâ€™s about a man in a black hood who tests people who come across to him. There are like pink hoods and yellow hoods. At one point a guy accuses him of the test being a trick and the man in black gives him a blue hood or something. The final guy joins the black hood dude.

    (I was a little disconcerted that the group of super-engineers are described as though having the worst living arrangements.)
