## Writing Prompt: the Postcard from the 2020 Future

### Post:

(Content warning/Themes: regret, warning/danger, isolation, reconnection, hardship)

What an effing year 2020 has been. Your head throbs and your thoughts spin about all of the events that have happened. Your heart is full of tangled emotions. You settle down to browse Reddit to unwind when your consciousness spins in an unsettling fashion. Your vision blurs as your eyes and nose water. Your sense of smell vanishes. Is this COVID?, you wonder for but a brief moment.

...

It is 12/10/2019. Or at least that’s what your phone and computer claim when your regain consciousness wearing new clothes on a new day and feeling very disoriented.

...

You find yourself at your writing desk sitting in front of a postcard that you were intending to write to a family or friend, but almost didn’t send out in time. You feel a sense of desperate urgency and nausea, with the memory equivalent of needing to use the bathroom but finding nowhere to go in time. And that’s when you realize it.


You are a time traveler. You don’t know how you did it, but you recall seeing a brief description of an RPG somewhere — #WaitforMe — where the premise was that you traveled randomly on your own timeline for mere seconds — and the only thing you could do was write a short message and then you returned.


So, with that in mind, you commit. You pick up the pen, with a shaky hand and write on the back of that postcard and write that message. 


You have 5 minutes.

You have a postcard.

Go.


(Optional)


... will it ever get sent in time? Will it make a difference? Who do you choose to write to? If you warn them about anything, are you convincing?

  Dear self,

  Check the news in Wuhan in January. Cybywy; you have time to do this right. Get the inlaws to get fiber, and when February comes, go out East with the baby and our wife, or you're not gonna have a minute of babysitting time for nine months.

  Think about it: buy into Zoom, short the cruise lines, and remember that the market is pathologically insane so it's going to come right back after the crash.

  Nothing you're currently planning to do to help any movement or organization worked out. Find other things to try.

  We kept the exercise routine and diet up all year. I know you can do it, cause I already did.

  Love,
  self.

  Obviously I chose to write to myself with the best advice I could ever have gotten. Would it have worked? Yes. In February, I was looking at the oncoming COVID crisis and almost took it appropriately seriously, but didn't because I didn't want to believe how bad it was going to be. (My estimation was still short of what actually happened but not by much. I didn't have any actual reason not to expect it to happen. I just... couldn't believe it would happen.) If I'd had a note from the future? That'd tip me over.

  All of the following will be written in the code I use for quick & private me-to-me communication, for verification purposes.

  Hello past me! It is present me. From the future! 

  The earlier, rocky, Beatles songs are actually much better than their later, more psychodelic ones. Listen to them, you'll see. 

  There will be a pandemic beginning in Wuhan China sometime January. Invest in Zoom, and Amazon. Encourage your parents & family to sell most other stocks, and do the fancy thing where you sell stocks now & buy them later (when the market is down) even though you don't own any stocks. idk, talk to the family broker. Stocks will only be down, like, for a very short while in February & March, then they'll shoot right back up again. Also suggested you start telling everyone you can about pandemics & how likely they are. This will surely increase your credibility among family and friends. 

  The pandemic will last about a year and 2-6 months. idk, it's still going on (knowledge from 12/12/2020). The vaccine is *just* coming out (also may want to talk about how terribly slow the FDA is while discussing possible pandemics, made by Phizer, moderna, and AstroZeneca---so want to invest in them too if possible).

  Also, stop being such a wimp. [name] *obviously* likes you. Take her out to ice skating or whatever, since by the time things actually started moving there, the virus hit. 

  You place too much value on school, and not enough value on doing your own thing. Do your own thing more, and give homework the finger (or get a goddamn job and pay others to do it for you. This isn't rocket science). Textbooks are your friend. 

  The Bayesian Conspiracy is a fun podcast, and their Discord is super cool too.

  Become a vegetarian. Animals have much more moral weight than you currently think.

  Oh, and the other thing: by writing this, I am likely killing myself for you. Don't let me die in vain :). See you in a year! Byyyyyyeeeeee

  Future you.

  edit: took longer than 5 min to write this, [but whatever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ppaiQ6mhbE).
