## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding and Writing Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*
* Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is *also* the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  I'm working on a superhero story where the main plotline revolves around the two main characters, a novice hero and a novice villain, stumbling onto a government conspiracy that is making villains disappear and stealing their powers to give to people who want to be heroes.

  No one suspects anything up until the story proper, but for some reason I'm having a hard time figuring out a pair of inciting incidents to get these characters suspicious of what is going on. I suppose it could be one incident that catches both of their attentions, but I still can't figure out what it would be.

  The conspiracy has to kill these villains to harvest their powers, but they have been able to either make the trail go cold or provide answers that stop investigations (i.e. fake bodies). Furthermore, they do need to employ scientists to make the process work. I have a feeling that them making a mistake would work, but I can't think something that doesn't make the answer super obvious.

    You could have the level of effort put into this be variable, which would provide a fingerhold for the characters. *Some* villains you need to provide answers for, but others, low-level powers who live quietly unimportant criminal lives, those might be disappeared by the powers that be without the same level of care and attention. The inciting incident could be from one of those lower level targets, part of an expanded program after the success of the first wave -- and the protagonists are the only ones who actually care about the person in question, for their own reasons. (As ideas, novice villain was a friend or contact, novice hero used the victim as an informant, victim leaves a suicide note, but no body is found, and it's not immediately apparent that this is connected to other deaths and disappearances.)

    The villain could have some additional part of their power they never use in public. If they had some kind of noncombat teleportation power, they could escape from holding before getting harvested, then go to a minor hero anonymously, deepthroat-style, to get the ball rolling on investigation.

    As to what kind of power could let them teleport, let's say they have the ability to see their surroundings from all angles at all times. You can't sneak up on them, and they're really good in a melee, much like Skitter. However, they're careful to never let slip that the less they move, the wider and sharper their vision is, and if they stop moving entirely for about 5 seconds they can teleport to anywhere in about 100 meters, then do it again as teleportation doesn't count as moving to their power.

  I've been drafting the story that [I was planning in last week's thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/f6bw9n/d_wednesday_worldbuilding_and_writing_thread/fi3rlwq/). I wouldn't recommend following it live, since I've already done heavy revisions of a published chapter, and intend to do more, but it's there if you want. Feedback is appreciated, and you can't rate it lower than Allister did, so give me your worst!
