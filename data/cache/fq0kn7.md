  Why did our resident Good Boy not eat the Snakebear?

  Seems odd that the dog was hungry, they killed a monster as big as he was, and then he wandered off still hungry rather than at least trying a bite.

  The creature didn't disappear.  The NPC's didn't mention that it was poisonous or shoo Athos away or anything.  Seems like a waste of monster meat.

    Right, I forgot to pay that one out. It was the thing he'd smelled before, and stank so much he couldn't *bear* it. ( :> )

  Didn't end up making it to Hellsport, but hopefully this will suffice for enjoyment.
