  I'm tentatively hopeful that Kurama actually is as beneficent as he seems. It would be nice if everything he said was sincere and truthful, but I rather doubt it at this point. He is a demon, after all.

      Or he doesn't remember being hypnotised by Tobi, perhaps? He also mentioned Kushina sealed him off from her senses, rather than the whole 'impale me in a giant wheel with really big spikes' thing that canon did.

        This one I'll give you as a freebie:  Tobi never hypnotized him.  The idea that a human could forcibly control the mind of a primordial demon is utter bullshit.  Lay a genjutsu on his human host which deceives the bijuu because he is limited to Naruto's senses as interpreted by his brain?  Absolutely.  Put it directly on an ancient being made of pure chakra who only has physical form when it remembers to and has senses aside from the human?  Hell no.  You can't create an illusion of something you can't sense yourself -- see Sachi's issues with chakra systems.  (Well, technically it IS possible, but it requires some work to set up.)

  Similar question as earfluff; is Kurama as benevolent as he seems? Normally, I have no problem with a benevolent Kurama. But yours seems a little too eager to please. And even disregarding that, since this is a Rationalist story, and the Kyuubi is an ancient entity, I'd assume he'd be much more....superior, I suppose, from a mental standpoint.

  So is this guy an honest good guy or a manipulator? Or should I just wait and keep reading to find out? :P

    Reddit has long been a hot spot for conversation on the internet. About 57 million people visit the site every day to chat about topics as varied as makeup, video games and pointers for power washing driveways.

    In recent years, Reddit’s array of chats also have been a free teaching aid for companies like Google, OpenAI and Microsoft. Those companies are using Reddit’s conversations in the development of giant artificial intelligence systems that many in Silicon Valley think are on their way to becoming the tech industry’s next big thing.

    Now Reddit wants to be paid for it. The company said on Tuesday that it planned to begin charging companies for access to its application programming interface, or A.P.I., the method through which outside entities can download and process the social network’s vast selection of person-to-person conversations.

    “The Reddit corpus of data is really valuable,” Steve Huffman, founder and chief executive of Reddit, said in an interview. “But we don’t need to give all of that value to some of the largest companies in the world for free.”

    The move is one of the first significant examples of a social network’s charging for access to the conversations it hosts for the purpose of developing A.I. systems like ChatGPT, OpenAI’s popular program. Those new A.I. systems could one day lead to big businesses, but they aren’t likely to help companies like Reddit very much. In fact, they could be used to create competitors — automated duplicates to Reddit’s conversations.

    Reddit is also acting as it prepares for a possible initial public offering on Wall Street this year. The company, which was founded in 2005, makes most of its money through advertising and e-commerce transactions on its platform. Reddit said it was still ironing out the details of what it would charge for A.P.I. access and would announce prices in the coming weeks.

    Reddit’s conversation forums have become valuable commodities as large language models, or L.L.M.s, have become an essential part of creating new A.I. technology.

    L.L.M.s are essentially sophisticated algorithms developed by companies like Google and OpenAI, which is a close partner of Microsoft. To the algorithms, the Reddit conversations are data, and they are among the vast pool of material being fed into the L.L.M.s. to develop them.

      > he sounds in this story like the jinchuuriki thing has been going on for a long, long time.

      Yes.  In canon the conversation went something like this:

      Ten-Tails:  Grr!  I rampage!

      Sage:  You mustn't!

      Ten-Tail:  But I will!

      Sage:  I split you into nine parts!  And then I walk away!

      Tailed beast 1-9:  ...?  Really?  Uh...okay, thanks!  Grrr, we rampage!

      I figure it makes hella more sense if he split them up and then sealed them away.  In Team Anko-verse they've been passed down for a thousand years from one jinchuriki to the next; sometimes they get out for one reason or another and do their rampage-y thing, but mostly they stay sealed. 

      (In retrospect, I really should have been spelling it 'jinchuuriki', since I've been using 'uu' to represent 'u with macron'. It was an early-on mistake and I'm not going back through 14 chapters and then re-uploading all of them through FFN's irritating interface just to fix that little not-terribly-important bug.)

  Ordinarily I wouldn't be posting until next week, but the Muse was gracious so here you go.  Also, [chapter 1](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11087425/1/Team-Anko) was updated with a glossary and some statements about how canon changed.
