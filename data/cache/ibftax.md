## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  [Pith](https://pithserial.com/) is fucking awesome and you should read it.

  If you want something that feels like a spiritual successor to Worm, (instead of being a meandering actual sequel to Worm, say) this is it.

  Ten years ago the ~~muggles~~ humdrums learned the truth - the world had been secretly ruled by an international conspiracy of ~~wizards~~ projectors for centuries. Now, the people of the early 20th century ~~Britain~~ Principality can publicly apply to the premier magical academy in the world! But the number of positions is woefully limited and the chaff, more often than not, falls to the gangs of ~~London~~ Elmidde.

  Ana is a girl with no legally applicable job skills in a decaying black market body. If she is to survive the year she will need to find a new one.

  Luckily, Principality black ops is always hiring. Unluckily, the new Principality government does not believe that it needs - or has - a black ops division.

  On a shoestring budget, this ragtag bunch of half-educated projectors tries to defend the nation against the mob, populists and foreign agents.

  And all the while, what little still remains of the world is being slowly but surely devoured by the ocean.

    Wildbow's latest work, [Pale](https://palewebserial.wordpress.com/about/), has much more of these moments than what Wildbow usually writes.

    Part of it is probably that they're the first actual *child* protagonists he ever wrote, with the exception of Twig, where the "children" were >!an Academy-created experiment used as state-sponsored terrorists rooting out dissenters and rogue scientists!<. They have actual social and home lives, and their friendship and how it develops is a big focus.

    I'm gonna recommend some stories which have a lot of slice of life and the *small interactions,* but aren't exactly about magic schools.

    Ar'Kendrythist is half slice of life and half action drama. If you can get past the main character's wishy-washy personality for the first few chapters (it takes a while for him to realize the seriousness of his station and act on it), it gets much better. Later on, a lot of the chapters focus on Erick's relationship with the characters around him, which I really liked. It does feature a middle aged man as the main character though, so most of the social interaction happens with people around his age. So not *that*  much magic school drama.


    Magic Smithing features an isekai'd character who grows up in a loving household and an overall nice village. There hasn't been much driving plot yet, but the protagonist has been improving her blacksmithing skills. Very slice of life, and for the most part enjoyable.

    Savage Divinity also ha a lot of slice of life, sometimes to the detriment of its plot. If you can bear the protagonist's bouts of depression and the harem (which isn't badly done, but might not be for some people), there are many good chapters. It starts off as a wuxia, but changes genres after chapter 500 something, and imo it's better now. It's something long to tide you over. 

    If you're really really into the small interactions, you can't really go wrong with Jacqueline Carey or Robin Hobb. Be prepared for a lot of tears though.
    ```

    - u/GlueBoy:
      ```
      I'm going to counter rec Savage Divinity, **with prejudice**. It was once decent and promising and I was pretty invested in it, but its quality dropped and dropped until I came to actively hate it. Even then I kept reading for another hundred chapters, thinking that it was on the verge of picking up again. But no, it never did, it became clear the author had abandoned any pretense of advancement of plot or characterization and just decided to drag it out indefinitely. Just thinking back to the the TENS OF THOUSANDS OF WORDS I read on how cute a critter is or their adorable little antics or the POV character cuddling them makes me what want to track down the author and **~~commit murder suicide~~** check for signs of a lobotomy. 

      I don't normally go this hard, but this story is so bad that the best that can be said about anyone still reading this piece of shit is that they're simultaneously suffering from Stockholm Syndrome and the Sunk Cost Fallacy, as I once was. For someone to actively recommend it... well, I'll leave it unsaid how badly I think that reflects on you.
      ```

      - u/TacticalTable:
        ```
        I'm very deep in the sunk cost fallacy and I absolutely agree with you on every critique. I skim most of the chapters at this point, but it does seem like the plot is finally moving again.  Still the occasional 8k word chapter that's entirely boring pointless battle scene, animal hugging, or 'being amazed at how cool the MC is', but I think the author is improving again.

        Absolutely still wouldn't recommend it, but it's at least paying off a bit now.
        ```

        - u/CaramilkThief:
          ```
          Lol I agree with both you guys as well. I definitely had a phase where I actively hated the story and the author for making Rain commit the same mistake over and over again and expect change. Now I've come to accept it, and read the chapters monthly or bi-monthly. The story is a lot better than some egregious shit that I've read, and I still enjoy Rain's pov chapters. His whole thought process and behavior still feels genuine, if a bit annoying. Except for some, most of the side character chapters *are* pretty inconsequential, and I skim those. 

          The issues in the story are many, but there are many good things about it as well. I've decided that I can overlook the issues and still enjoy the story for what it is (much like how so many people can enjoy cookie cutter xianxia and litrpgs I guess?).
          ```

      - u/ricree:
        ```
        Sadly, I'll have to second your anti-rec, even though I'm pretty sure I've given an actual rec for it in the past.

        The story had promise and a strong start, but just allowed itself to become bogged down in the worst, most inane ways. I still read it every now and again out of habit and misplaced hope, but cannot even remotely suggest that anyone else start.
        ```

    - u/ricree:
      ```
      > Savage Divinity also ha a lot of slice of life, sometimes to the detriment of its plot

      Massively to its detriment.

      That said, even if we take it at the author's word, it still isn't a good slice of life.

      Slice of life doesn't just mean "mope at home and pet your kitties". Rather, it tends to suggest conflicts that are of a personal, social, or everyday sort. By and large, this isn't really true of Rain or his struggles. His important relationships are, by and large, established, friendly, and fixed. What social struggles he has tend to be either ignored as inconsequential or brushed aside trivially.

      What conflicts he does engage with, however, tend to be the sort of high stakes world changing issues that are vastly beyond the scope of any reasonable "slice of life", it's just that they happen very slowly and interspersed by chapter after chapter of largely pointless fluff and reaction.


      If someone does want a slice of life Xianxia, however, I'd give a pretty strong recommendation to [Forge of Destiny](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21188/forge-of-destiny). It's a magic school xianxia about a street urchin attending a cultivation academy after it is discovered that she has a strong talent for it. There's not really any overarching plot or issue at hand, just the day to day issues of someone thrown out of their depth trying to figure out how to make the best of an unfamiliar situation that offers much greater opportunities than she'd ever imagined, but only if she is resourceful and strong enough to claim them.

      The story is pretty neutral on the rational-irrational spectrum. Characters mostly behave in reasonableish ways based on their circumstances and characterization, but it doesn't go out of its way to be especially rational either. The story isn't perfect, but it's pretty solid and a decent recommendation for anyone who finds either xianxia or magic schools interesting as a genre.
      ```

    - u/Turniper:
      ```
      Many serials are a bit of a pain to read week to week as they update (I'm looking at you Heart of Cultivation) but great to binge. Savage Divinity is the opposite, the heavy slice of life can make binging it pretty 
      bothersome (Well, for the slow sections), but it's great reading as it updates.

    ```
    I think you may enjoy Sufficiently Advanced Magic by Andrew Rowe. Besides that the Cradle series by Will Wight also fits.
    ```

    - u/Archbldr:
      ```
      I'm holding off on Sufficiently Advanced Magic until the series is complete as I don't like to leave stories unfinished unless that doesn't matter I'm this case. I remember trying Cradle out a while ago and stopped for some reason I'll give it another go though :)
      ```

      - u/Nnaelo:
        ```
        Cradle really pick up around book 4 or 5. Also, you might want to wait  for book 8 to come out so you can read book 7 together with it otherwise you're going to be hanging on a cliff with the rest of us.
        ```

      - u/Autonous:
        ```
        Be warned that the Cradle series is also far from finished. In fact I think the author hinted at some point it's only like halfway or so.

        You may also enjoy the Vorkosigan Saga, this one is actually done. It's sci-fi but it reads a lot like fantasy, no magic though. The Warrior's Apprentice by Lois McMaster Bujold is a good starting point for the saga.
        ```

        - u/Archbldr:
          ```
          (I think you might have just found why I dropped Cradle for the time being) The Vorkosigan Saga sounds cool I'll definitely check that out.

She sets off to find her mom and normally would've been killed in two minutes by many wasteland horrors if not for a protective suit, and more importantly, if not for being made out of very toxic pink gas.

    Story with a cute (but *very* young and naïve) protagonist with a hefty dose of body horror, especially in later chapters.

  I'd like to recommend [*The Outer Wilds*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/753640/Outer_Wilds/) (not to be confused with *The Outer Worlds.*)

  I was blown away by this game and believe it is best played completely blind, as it focuses entirely on your personal exploration and discoveries. You, as part of a low-tech space program, navigate your miniature solar system and explore each of the planets not to destroy baddies or collect mcguffins, but to understand the world your species lives in. 

  Honestly, this is the one game in a thousand that has captured an actual sense of wonder in its mechanics and game-play loop, and if you have any interest in the space exploration genre you owe it to yourself to pick this up and play it as blind as possible.

    [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZ5KzvW4Bys) is very good though, he interviews the devs and has some really fun and interesting comments on the 'texture of space' and how the game makes you intuitively understand relativity and gravity.
    ```

    - u/Dufaer:
      ```
      There's no relativity in the game. Everything's classical, likely Newtonian or not even that (the gravity of the planets as mentioned in the video).

      This means that the orbital mechanics are no more complex than those of [Kerbal Space Program](https://store.steampowered.com/app/220200/Kerbal_Space_Program/) or [Children of a Dead Earth](https://store.steampowered.com/app/476530/Children_of_a_Dead_Earth/).

      The only "relative" thing mentioned in the video is that the game handles the interactions between two objects in motion (in respect to the game-engine-global coordinates) very well.
      ```

      - u/zorianteron:
        ```
        It's likely that one of the devs mentioned 'relativity' as in 'galilean relativity', and the videomaker, as well as any popular science science writer would have, latched on to the buzzword 'relativity'.

        The eternal torment of Gell-Mann.
        ```

      - u/fassina2:
        ```
        Oh I thought there was a mechanic like that, I'm misremembering it, the teleporting stations flavor text just implies that you arrive before you leave the point of origin and for a brief amount of time matter gets created from nothing. 

        &#x200B;

        The things that makes it specially blatant as opposed to kerbal is the scale, things in this game are very close to each other, in one minute you can switch between being mostly influenced by the gravity star to a planet then to a moon. You're constantly reorienting the direction of your thrust to compensate for it.
        ```

        - u/Dufaer:
          ```
          Interesting.

          Well, you can very well arrive before you leave, but you obviously will never be able to see your future self (i.e. avatar) or the consequences of your future self's actions before you teleport (because the game cannot know those).

          I was just saying that you cannot "intuitively understand relativity" through the game, because the game engine does not use anything from any theory of relativity. Unlike [this thing](http://gamelab.mit.edu/research/openrelativity/), for example.

          You can understand orbital mechanics, of course.

  ```
  I've mentioned it before, but I feel like [Heart of Cultivation](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/32502/heart-of-cultivation) deserves its own thread more than a lot of works that get posted to this sub.  It has a competent, but still believable main character, secondary characters that feel unique, and things overall feel like real thought has been put into them.

  But what really makes it a match here is how often the main character solves problems using wits in believable and satisfying ways.

  This is the only Xianxia story I didn't give up on.  Like most in the genre, it takes a while to build up, but I figure that's a bonus for a lot of people here.

  The author mentioned that early bad reviews really hurt its popularity on Royal Road, so I'm hoping you guys enjoy it enough to leave your own.  I really don't want this author to get discouraged enough to drop the story.

  Edit: I should also mention that the early bad reviews weren't because the story starts out badly.  I feel like it has a relatively strong beginning.  The author just used some common Xianxia tropes that other people thought were plagiarized from other specific stories, even though this one is very different despite superficial similarities.
  ```

  - u/lmbfan:
    ```
    Seconded.  Quality writing and doesn't assume the reader is familiar with xanxia/wuxia or however they're spelt.  A little light on character development but it's early days yet.  Plot moves along quickly compared to many serial fics.
    ```

  - u/WarZealot92:
    ```
    The problem with Xianxia is that typically there is no plot in the first 200k words. In the best case they serve to establish the MC's personality and abilities. Exceptions exist, but are extremely rare.

    Is Heart of Cultivation such an exception? The story hasn't even reached 100k words yet - does it already have a plot worth mentioning?
    ```

    - u/sibswagl:
      ```
      If you want a more spoiler-y summary than the above, which sounds a little generic:

      >!The main character’s cultivation stalled due to a problem with his heart. He devised a plan to replace his heart with an artificial one, but never went through with it because he felt the risk wasn’t worth it. Now that the plot has kicked off and he needs to get stronger, he’s actively working on replacing his heart.!<
      ```

    - u/zorianteron:
      ```
      Haven't read much xianxia, so I don't know what to compare to, but I'd say so.  Plot summary:  MC has rich parents, but has a disabled soul that can't cultivate; he has to figure out a way around this and get out of an arranged marriage to a girl whose family is now of a status above his own (the marriage was arranged back when he seemed to be a prodigy) without losing his family, or himself, too much face in the process.
      ```

    - u/steelong:
      ```
      You've already got two good answers, but I'll add to them.  The plot they describe kicks off within the first 10 chapters, and from there the protagonist has so far taken several important steps towards solving his current main problem.
      ```

  - u/ricree:
    ```
    I liked it so far, though I do wonder where the story will go once the initial heart issue is resolved. There's a big risk that it either drags the initial issue out too long or else winds up merging into a more traditional cultivation story.

    I can see places it might go (transhumanist themes, perhaps), but we won't know until it gets there.

  I'm having trouble finding a fic I used to read every day but lost the bookmark to when I got a new phone. It's a particularly good SI into the world of ASOIF.

He does a generally decent job of trying to uplift his world and create a sea-focused dominance of the realm to help bolster his father's vasseldom. Can't quite remember the name of it.

  Any other ASOIF fics are welcome as well. Although I am currently reading Purple Days so no need to recommend that.

      I need to counterrec this one, it starts off extremely entertaining but it lost me with the OC war of the stepstones or whatever. Like three hundred OCs that weren't developed or interesting to read became frequent viewpoints, as the main character became more and more generic.

          I can understand that it has to have a lot of OC characters, but GRRM made sure to develop his own characters before they got in a dragged out war, so you could care about them. This isn't the case in the fic.

          Also, "so far"? Is it still going? I dropped it quite a while ago.

    I've been loving these two crossover fics on SpaceBattles:

    **[The King is Dead](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-king-is-dead-arthas-menethil-warcraft-in-asoiaf.840089/)**

    (World of Warcraft/ASoIaF)

    Starting premise:

    Arthas Menethil from World of Warcraft is reborn as Joffrey's twin.

    Blurb:
    >*The people called him the Pious Prince. His friends claimed he was a Baratheon, and his enemies called him a Lannister. They were all wrong for before any of those things, he was Arthas Menethil, the Damned Prince of Lordaeron, the Betrayer, kinslayer and kingslayer. His sins were legion. Mother have mercy on his soul.*

    The author does a great job of delving into the mindset of each character, showing how their actions are shaped by different motivations, stratagems, and moral struggles, etc. Arthas, in particular, is very well written, and the story explores how his desire to atone for his past life inevitably conflicts with the cynical scheming of feudal nobility in Westeros.

    Events quickly diverge from ASoIaF canon, with snowball effects building momentum into a fast-paced, gripping plot.

    ---

    **[Gospel of the Lost Gods](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/gospel-of-the-lost-gods-asoiaf-worm.760033/)**

    (Worm/ASoIaF)

    Starting premise/blurb:

    >*Taylor and the Chicago Wards are thrown into Westeros while on a mission. Now they must survive.*

    The story starts out looking like an an isekai uplift plot, but in my opinion it really starts to shine when the Wards inevitably come into conflict with local governance and must learn to play the game of feudal politics in order to survive. Shard shenanigans serve to disrupt the best laid plots of Lords and Ladies across Westeros.

    Along the way, the story examines how modern concepts of 'good' and 'heroism' don't really translate in a feudal system where 'good' meant unwavering fealty to a liege, no matter how cruel and selfish his commands might be.
    ```

    - u/SkyTroupe:
      ```
      Will I need and WoW knowledge to enjoy The King is Dead? I have never played WoW and only know very little through cultural osmosis. I do enjoy the idea of a Joffery twin though.

      &#x200B;

      Who are the Chicago wards again? I think Theo was one right? Having his power would be very interesting in ASOIF due to the ability to easily manipulate materials for building.

      &#x200B;

      Thank you for the recommendations!

        The important parts of Arthas' backstory are covered during the course of the fic, and in my opinion the author introduces his PoV so well that you don't need prior familiarity. At most, I'd recommend skimming a few wiki articles to get the basic gist of what the Lich King and Death Knights were in WoW. 

        In a nutshell:

        >!Arthas was the Prince of the human kingdom of Lordaeron. He trained to be a Paladin of the 'Light' (basically, a generic 'good' deity). His kingdom was attacked by a necromancer who infected the populace with a plague of undeath. Arthas made some choices based on harsh moral calculus in the struggle to save his people, which eventually led him down the slippery slope of morality. He lost his sanity to a cursed blade which had given him the power to defeat the necromancer. In the end, he became that which he fought against: the Lich King - a necromancer of unfathomable power who commanded legions of undead to overrun the living kingdoms.!<

        ---

        The Chicago Wards were the team that >!Skitter joined soon after she started her hero career as 'Weaver'.!< [The wiki](https://worm.fandom.com/wiki/Chicago#The_Wards) has a good list if you'd like to refresh your memory on their powerset. Theo and the rest of the team do have some interesting synergies (as well as foibles) when stuck in a medieval society.

        I hope you enjoy the fics!

    You've already read the Vorkosigan Saga, so I can't recommend that.

    Timothy Zahn's Thrawn trilogy (heir to the empire, Dark force rising, the last command) is a great read. It was written really early in the EU, so there's some stuff that doesn't align perfectly with later canon, but it's still really excellent. The Hand of Thrawn Duology is also good but not as strong as the first three.

    Likewise, the Star Wars Rogue Suadron and Wraith Squadron series were both well done, albeit not as much so.

    A Fire Upon the Deep has the premise that the Galaxy is divided into different "zones" by the density of mass, with available technology scaling inversely with the gravity. An Archaelogical expedition accidentally unleashes a UAI from one such extremely advanced civilization.

    I'm not 100% sure that https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7406866/1/To-the-Stars (PMMM Scifi Fanfic) is 100% what you're looking for,  but it's really good scifi anyway, plus Magical Girls in Space is 100% aesthetic.

    https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21216/grand-design was pretty good as well, albeit more HFY than I usually go for.

      Thanks for your recommendations. I'll check them out.

      I've heard of To the Stars before, but was immediately put off by the magical girls thing. What does it actually entail? It seems to me that space opera and magical girls anime are about the two least likely things to be combined.
      ```

      - u/tobias3:
        ```
        The problem with hard SF with AI, post-scarcity, trans-humanity etc. is that you basically can't have a typical adventure/war/hero story anymore where a human's actions actually affect the outcome. The AI's are obviously better at e.g. warfare, why not let them do everything? You can write books about philosophical questions, e.g. if you should interfere with more primitive species, etc. (look at "The Culture" novels for that).If you add a "magic" system that only humans can access you have an immediate fix for this problem. So To the Stars has a realistic post-scarcity hard SF setting while still having protagonists with agency that one can relate to. The magical girl setting To the Stars uses is relatively hard as well, so it all fits together well, too.

        It's a Madoka fanfic, which means that magic is actual physics breaking magic that runs on emotions, but made usable by  >!clarktech from a kardeshev 2+ species known as the incubators in order to stave off the heat death of the universe!<. Madoka was already a fairly rational story and one of the most Sci-Fi magical girl shows around, but to the stars takes it a step further. In TTS, the conceit is that the events of canon Madoka took place a couple centuries ago, and in the meantime, humanity has climbed it's way to the stars. They have friendly AI, post scarcity economy, FTL, interstellar colonies, etc. However, they're also at war with an alien species with more advanced technolgy; their equalizer is Magical Girls, who the aliens have no known equivalent to.

    I'm not sure how rational they are, as it's been a while since I've read them and I hadn't discovered Rational Fiction back then, but I'm a big fan of Peter F. Hamilton's [Commonwealth Saga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Saga).

    Starting with [Pandora's Star](https://www.amazon.com/Pandoras-Star-Commonwealth-Peter-Hamilton/dp/0345479211) the series is about a far-future multi-planet-civilization humanity where an astronomer discovers a star he's been watching suddenly turns off.  Not going nova, or dying in some other way, just on one second and off the next.  Eventually an expedition is sent to investigate and something goes horribly wrong, kicking off a great adventure with plenty of interesting characters and a good mix of intrigue and action.

      The Commonwealth saga is great, that was my first exposure to life extension stuff. His latest series, the Salvation Sequence is great too, the final book will release in a few months.

    [Grand Design](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21216/grand-design) is a completed webserial, and one of the few works on RR that don't seem to be litRPG power fantasies. Hundreds of years after Humanity's cataclysmic disappearance, several alien species have founded a civilization in the ruins of Humanity's space stations. Two women who might be the last remnants of the human Navy search for clues about what - or who - wiped them out. Starts out a bit too *Humanity Fuck Yea* for my tastes, but it does become a great story about themes like transhumanism and cultural uplifts.

  It doesn't scratch any specific plot itches that are common in the rationalist community (like uplift, magitech, nation optimizing, plotting and counterplotting or what have you), but the world building is superb, I haven't seen any plot holes, and the main character is a quest main character, meaning she doesn't hold obvious idiot balls. On the other hand despite it being a quest the author still manages to have great characterization, themes and just generally enjoyable writing. And most things are decided by dice rolls, meaning that upsets and failures do happen, though we have been quite lucky overall.

  What are some fanfictions you guys have enjoyed a lot, preferably over 300k words. Doesn't have to be rationalist, just rational enough to be enjoyable. Also preferably not the ones that are well known in this community (HPMOR, Luminosity, some of the well known MLP stuff). Here's a few I've really enjoyed:

  * [Brockton's Celestial Forge](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/brocktons-celestial-forge-worm-jumpchain.70036/) is a worm fanfic with a tinker OC. The power is basically Inspired Inventor lite. Surprisingly, the author has made the protagonist not overpowered within 5 chapters. There's also an SI component, with the protagonist's shard being the SI, but it's pretty well done imo. What I liked was the tech building, pretty good character exploration (of both the protagonist and some other characters), and the building tension as the protagonist gets into deeper shit.

  * [Going Native](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/going-native-dbz-dc-comics.789109/) is a DC/DBZ crossover with the Frieza Force being in the DC galaxy. It's a self insert into Tarble, who gets taught the hard way how Saiyan life works. The story is about how, slowly, the SI's character gets broken down into the ideal Saiyan, who's ready to genocide whole planets and not blink. There is really good exploration of saiyan life, and how the Frieza Force could work in the DC universe. Some nice galactic politics and powerups too.

  * [Love in the Dark](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13354836/1/Love-in-the-Dark) is an Edelgard/Byleth romance from Fire Emblem: Three Houses. It's cute and a nice comfort read. 

  * [RE: We Defeated the Devil King, But Now Our Daily Life is Compromised](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12593394/1/RE-We-Defeated-the-Devil-King-But-Now-Our-Daily-Life-is-Compromised) is a Konosuba fanfic with the premise that Kazuma and co. accidentally defeat the demon king, and now have to live with it. Of course, being their team, they get into more shenanigans. The humor is genuinely good at times, although the character voices can feel a bit samey at times. Also a comfort read.

    https://archiveofourown.org/works/3591783/chapters/7921653 (700k): Embers is an AtlA AU fanfic of epic scale, centered largely around Zuko. The worldbuilding is great, Zuku and Iroh are great, the writing quality itself is really solid. It began life as a PoD fic and changed over to an alternate backstory as well when they decided where they were going with it, though, so there's some installment weirdness.

    https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8679666/1/Fairy-Dance-of-Death (700k) Fairy Dance of Death is fucking incredible, despite how poor of a source it draws from. The core idea is "what if (good) Alfheim took the place of Aincrad." Completely hard magic with complete and explicit rules on what it can and cannot do, and thanks to its setting, is able to make it completely believable that these rules aren't completely well known. The writing itself is excellent as well, and the character feel like fundamentally the same people even as the new circumstances and writing makes the more interesting. Seriously AU, obviously.

    https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12870721/1/Kallen-Stadtfeld-Countess-of-Britannia (323k). Kallen Stadtfeldt is an AU Code Geass fic, with the point of divergence being that Kallen elects to go with her father to Britannia rather than stay with her mother in japan. Good politics, good protagonists, none of the really stupid asspulls like with canon Euphemia.

    https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20 (314k) Harry Potter / DnD. Milo, a low level DnD wizard, finds himself suddenly in the middle of a death eater gathering just a little before the start of the Hogwarts year in book 1. Milo is a delightful protagonist and a great influence on the story. He's just differently Genre Savvy enough to make for a very interesting relationship with the canon plot and world; forex, he's able to easily identify Harry Potter as a protagonist (well, PC) because that's just a thing where he's from, but assumes Fudge must be some powerful magical figure because he's the ruler of an entire nation of wizards. You've probably already seen this reccomended on R/R but it's great and if you haven't that would be a shame.

    https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/dragon-ball-after-the-end.30940/ (390k). Dragon Ball fic set well after canon. Normally I avoid these kind of fics like the plague, but PoptartProdigy is an excellent writer and Kakara has rapidly become one of my favorite fictional characters. Essentially, after Goku and Vegeta pass from old age, a new threat destroys earth, and our protagonist is a descendant of a group of their descendants that managed to escape earth on one of Bulma's spaceships and have been in hiding since.

    https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/dungeon-keeper-ami-sailor-moon-dungeon-keeper-story-only-thread.30066/ (880k) Dungeon Keeper Ami is a crossover between Sailor Moon and the Dungeon Keeper games. Sailor Mercury (the titular dungeon keeper Ami) finds herself in another world after a mishap with a Dark Kingdom plan, and finds herself forced by circumstance to become a keeper - one of said series' chief forces of darkness - to avoid suffocating from oxygen deprivation. It's a really well written fic with a believably smart protagonist. Lots of clever magic and physics, and some great worldbuilding. It doesn't require you to be super familiar with Sailor Moon, but my rereads definitely benefitted from me having watched it after getting interested by this fic.

    https://archiveofourown.org/works/4193346/chapters/9471504 (477k). A Familiar of Zero / Overlord (the game) crossover. The premise is that rather than summon bland McProtagonist, Louise instead fails to summon anything, and runs off to try become a hero to stop bringing shame to her family, with less than success. Much like dungeon keeper ami, this is a story about a good person in a situation where they take on the aesthetics and role of evil to accomplish something they couldn't otherwise. It looks at first glance like one of those descent into villainy fics, but it has a very interesting twist on it, namely that >!she's not on slippery slope. She's been stuck mainlining more evil magic than just about anyone else for as long as she's been alive, it's already done most of the damage it possibly can to get her to this point!<. More of the jokes will land if you're familiar with ZnT, but as someone with no exposure to it prior to this fic I can say it doesn't require more than cursory knowledge.

    Pretty much everything else I'd reccomend from your examples is under 300k but if you've already read most of these I have more in the 100-300k range.

      Would you mind clarifying which of these are completed/regularly updating/on hiatus/abandoned? 

      I ask because some of them that I am familiar with are either on hiatus (like HP and the D20...I almost want to call this abandoned since I'm skeptical that it will ever be finished even if the author does eventually drop a new chapter) or update VERY rarely (like DB after the end, the most recent april update came nearly 6 months after the previous update, and there is a gap of nearly 2 years from 2017 to 2019 where no updates were made)

      I don't mind reading things that are still being regularly updated (even if regular does not mean frequent), but I try to avoid things that update both sporadically AND infrequently or borderline abandoned.

        Embers is complete.

        Fairy Dance of Death hasn't updated in months, but there is currently work in beta; it tends to release in fairly large chunks. I know it is still in progress, as I saw several thousand words of WIP chapter posted last week on the spacebattles thread.

        Kallen Stadtfeld of Britannia hasn't updated in a couple of months, but the author is still active in other works and has expressed that they intend to continue the work.

        Natural 20 is probably dead.

        The author of Dragon Ball: After the end works in the health industry, so updates are currently rather delayed for obvious reasons. However, I'm not sure what you're talking about with a 2 year gap; there were regular updates all throughout 2017 and 2018.

        Dungeon Keeper Ami has weekly status updates; they don't write fast, but they do write, and have been regularly putting out updates to the story since 2009.

        Overlady is on Hiatus while Earthscorpion works on a different fic by the name of impurity. They say they intend to get back to it, and they've done so in the past for other stories, but once you finish the current content it's going to be a while for any future ones.

            You might have seen this already, but I'd give a strong recommendation to [SAO Abridged](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6kJKxvbgZ0&list=PLuAOJfsMefuej06Q3n4QrSSC7qYjQ-FlU). It's not a perfect series, but I've found that it puts a lot more thought into character and worldbuilding than the original ever did. Especially when it comes to Kirito's character arc. Not to mention it actually provides a vaguely plausible reason (if in a fitting darkly comedic way) why everyone got locked into the game in the first place.

          - u/None:
            ```
            Yeah, I wanted to like SAO itself but the series kept putting me off; I think the only set I'd recommend fully is GGO, and even then I've seen better.

            Progressive has it's own flaws, but is immensely better written than the original go-through of Aincrad and has a lot more space to do it.

            https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/fate-revelation-online.32628/ Fate/Revelation Online is a great fic if you're willing to read a nasuverse cross; the writing style is unique, but it's not bad and once you get used to it the story is worth it.

            https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8903072/1/Halkegenia-Online Halkegenia Online is an enormous Familiar of Zero / Sword Art Online crossover. It's set during the Alfheim Arc of SAO and the start of FoZ. Benefits from but does not require knowledge of Familiar of Zero, as the characters of SAO also lack such knowledge. Book three is currently on hiatus but there's over a million words before you get there.

            https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10212229/1/SAO-The-Century-Voyage The Century Voyage is passable. I think it's a serious step down from the other works listed here but it was a fine way to pass the time on a trip; I don't regret reading it, so if you're still looking for more SAO style content or just don't want a crossover it's here.

    > Brockton's Celestial Forge

    I liked the concept and characters, but found the power scaling somewhat annoying. It felt like he kept getting handed more and more broken abilities on a constant stream, so quickly that he never really got a chance to explore or play with and of the ones he's already had.
    ```

      My pet peeve with all of these 'MC is an SI OP tinker' is that they never prioritize anti-thinker for avoiding getting the attention of a S class threat.

        ```
        That seems to explicitly not be the case for Celestial Forge.

        OP is holding out for a technological solution, but from chapter 1 leverages his power using his actions to spoof thinker powers using a clever trick. >!Trigger Events can't be planned against by thinker powers and he continually gets mini-trigger events because of the celestial forge.  By tying his upgrades to new power unlocks specifically, thinker's can't predict him because to them it looks like he's going to be waiting forever for a trigger event that never comes.  On the downside it means he can't plan in advance and build up for certain things (eg build up a bunch of stuff to beat coil on a certain date)!<

      That is essentially how Great Powers were feeling about new weapons in WW2.

      New advanced tanks which could barely move (lauded T-34 had abysmal reliability at the start  of it's career) torpedoes which didn't explode, dive bombers with controls too complex for pilots to actually dive, rocket artillery which was less cost-effective then old artillery and much, much more.

    A Song for Two Voices
     https://archiveofourown.org/series/936480

    It's an explicitly rational fanfic of Mercedes Lackey's Valdemar series. Does not require knowledge of the original series (I've never read Valdemar but I have read other Lackey books). Plot takes a few books to get to the rational content. Well written. Tackles moral quandaries head on.

    Trigger warnings: lots of emotional trauma including self harm/suicide, depression, anxiety, it's set in a middle-ages/renaissance era so there's some implied/off screen underage sex (the one occasion of actual power imbalance that comes to mind is handled well IMO).

    Cons: seems like the MC is constantly in a sick bed/under recovery. OTOH it's actually more realistic than the "I suffered multiple life threatening injuries, but I'm both physically and mentally fine in a couple of hours" type stories. But it can get annoying.

    ETA not complete, looks to be finished in another couple of books

      I'll second this rec. I enjoy the world building quite a bit, as far as I can tell all the characters have their own agency and agendas, it shows a realistic progression of how conflicting desires can lead to conflict in a friend group, there are reasonable explanations for some of the horrible things magic can do and shows a very dark side of vows and rituals which explains why more people don't do them. It's not very rational, as some of the plans are very convoluted but reactions to events are realistic and characters have depth beyond reacting what is occurring to them at the moment.

      &#x200B;

      Multiple characters make decisions they're not happy about to ensure long term success of their goals and it's one of the few Harry Potter fics I've read with truly gray morality and hard decisions made about characters and events.

      &#x200B;

      The first chapter is probably going to be retconned and should be ignored because it starts at the end of fourth year and I think spoils some important plot points. It has you constantly thinking about how the story will get to that point rather than wondering where the story will go next.

      &#x200B;

      The author has a sketchy update schedule as a new chapter comes out about once a month (plus or minus a few days, tending towards plus), as he also is writing his own published book series and that tends to take priority over the fic.

      - u/sibswagl:

        Yeah, I'll fourth this recc, with the addendum that you should honestly just skip the prologue. My understanding is that the author was trying to set up a cliche "Wrong Boy Who Lived" prologue and then subvert the cliches in the story itself, but IMO it's not worth it. Trying to think how the story might reach the events of the prologue isn't as interesting.

      The litrpg system in the world is such that you level up and gain a class when you do something accordingly. There are a lot of utility classes that don't rely on combat. There is also no exp or stats whatsoever, just levels and skills awarded with level ups. I believe this mechanic allows the non combat classes like innkeeper (literally swept the floor in an abandoned inn, something an innkeeper would do), farmer, blacksmith, manager, diplomat, secretary, singer, dancer, etc to shine. Everyone can gain them and level up in them, it's just about action and will.

      Coincidentally, the leveling is related to pushing yourself. This result with most combat class users having lower levels than other classes because most don't push themselves so dangerously against monsters since you literally have a chance to die; they mostly play it safe and level slowly. The other classes can just dedicate or push themselves harder to craft, learn their trade to level up much safer, which means non combat classes mostly level easier.

  Does anyone have a completed LitRPG that they'd be willing to recommend? Everything I've seen has been pretty WiP.
  ```

  - u/DRMacIver:
    ```
    I think WiP might be something of a core feature of most LitRPG - the fact that it's an endless upward grind is in some way part of its charm. It's a format that lends itself well to being never ending.

    The only completed LitRPG I can think of offhand that I'd actively recommend is the New Game Minus series by Sarah Lin. It's pretty good, though if you've not read much LitRPG it might be a bit too deconstruction.

    "The Laboratory" series by Skyler Grant is Dungeon Core rather than LitRPG, but the two genres are pretty similar, and is very enjoyable and also completed.

    "The System Apocalypse" by Tao Wong isn't finished, but it's nine books along and feels like it's wrapping up in the next few books. It's pretty good.

    if you're into litrpg, have you tried asian webnovels? Not rationalist fiction by any means, but.. sovereign of judgement for example is a solid revenge-driven story set in a world that got subsumed by a system of sorts.

    There shorter ones like emperor of solo play, seoul's station necromancer which are pretty decent

    trashier ones like rebirth of the theif who ruled the world (complete) legendary moonlight sculptor, and overgeared which are literally set in videogames, super long, and meh quality but scratch an itch.

    But do check out sovereign of judgement it's pretty good and not excessively long imo..

    [World of Prime series](https://www.goodreads.com/series/129874-world-of-prime) is the only one that I like without reservations. Not your typical litrpg as it's based on 1.5e DnD rules rather than computer games. 

    [Threadbare trilogy](https://www.goodreads.com/series/233241-threadbare) is good, but it loses a bit of its charm in the second and third book. Still pretty good. 

    [Life Reset series](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40774974-life-reset) has a stupid premise and a weird ending but it's decent enough, particularly in pacing and climax(most litrpg writers are trash at this).
