## An Empirical Test for Rational Fiction

### Post:

There are a number of ways to think of *The Waves Arisen.* It’s a fun romp through the major events of *Naruto* while being hacked at every turn with shadow clones. It’s a depiction of what it feels like to FOOM from the inside. It’s an allegory for the dangers of teaching math to children.

Another view of *The Waves Arisen* is that it’s an experiment in what happens if you base an entire story purely around the notion of [Level 3 intelligence](https://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/level3intelligent).

A level 3 intelligent character is quite simply one who does the real work of rationality in the process of reaching conclusions. This work is done **on the page** and **in full view of the reader.**

> The readers who intensely loved the intelligence of the characters in HPMOR weren’t being impressed by the rocket-broomstick or other feats of Level 2 Intelligence. They were impressed by the detail on how Harry thinks through to the solutions he uses, the heuristics that Harry used to come up with his answer, the alternatives he considered and discarded. 

Outside the blessed halls o’ fanfiction, the highest proportion of level 3 intelligent characters is found in *cooking shows*, where the chef actually walks you through why the dish is the way it is and how to prepare it. As a direct consequence, **you can learn how to cook from watching cooking shows.** 

You can’t learn *everything* about cooking from cooking shows. You can learn cutting techniques, for example, but you will actually have to practice cutting to get good at it. But you can learn a lot.

> They felt themselves learning how to think better by watching Harry think, and from watching Harry himself learn to think better. 

The difference between being a really good detective and being Sherlock Holmes is that the former is hard work. A level 3 intelligent character does actual cognitive work on the page, just like how a chef on a cooking show actually cooks food right there in front of the camera. This cognitive work then exists as an *example* of cognitive work, and so can be consumed to *acquire* examples of cognitive work, which can be digested to *improve* cognitive performance.

In chapter 3 of *The Waves Arisen*, Naruto tries to come up with reasons why Sasuke and Hinata should doubt Kakashi’s claim about the weighted die. 

> “It’s not mine!” Naruto repeated. “Look, it’s not covered in my chakra yet, right Hinata? So it couldn’t have been copied when I had to get away from the fireball that almost killed us. And besides, how did he even know which pocket I had it in, if he didn’t put it there? Or how would he have known that it wasn’t just a normal dice? Maybe he carries it because he likes to cheat at dice games—or it might not even be a trick dice!”

Then Naruto does something quite unusual:

> Naruto started rolling the dice on the grass, trying to figure out if it really was weighted unfairly.

From a story perspective, this line doesn’t need to happen. Aside from a joke at the end where Naruto throws the die at Kakashi’s head, we get no resolution to the question of where the die comes from or whether it’s weighted, just Naruto’s opinion. As with so many things in *The Waves Arisen*, we’re never *explicitly told* what actually happened: who killed the Hokage and why, who killed Kakashi and why, what was Sai up to, what was Kabuto up to, etc. [We’re given enough clues to form conclusions, but never told.](https://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/solvable-mysteries) (Incidentally, this is a story about ninjas.)

This line is in the story just because Naruto *actually wants to know if the die is weighted* and *this is how you do it.*

> Naruto had enough evidence now to be convinced.

> *“This dice isn’t even rigged!”* he shouted, pelting it at the back of Kakashi’s head.

We see Naruto *want to know something* and *identify and execute the strategy to know something* and he does it *right there on the page.*

if YOU think you might have a weighted die you can test this RIGHT NOW USING NARUTO’S EXACT METHOD

YOU TOO CAN BE SMARTY NINJA BOY

**********

*The Waves Arisen* devotes enormous chunks to showing us exactly what Naruto does to become strong and why. He employs quite a simple method of performing tests, writing down observations, and using those observations as a springboard for devising new tests. Simple math lets him take general ideas and turn them into specific hypotheses fit for implementation in areas where small differences in outcomes really matter, such as life-or-death battle. Literally the only thing you can’t replicate yourself is the specific mechanics of ninja magic. 

E.g., from chapters 2, 3 and 4:

> Now he would be made a member of a proper genin team. He would have to determine later how the shadow clones actually worked, once he had some time to experiment, but the scroll had mentioned something vague about their accumulated injuries being split between the clones, which seemed like a good reason to be careful. He could easily imagine developing an unwarranted sense of security after seeing so many barely-injured clones harmlessly bursting, and if he ever chose to dispel a few extra bodies by leaping off a cliff he might find himself crippled with 75% of a broken neck—or whatever that would even mean.

> But despite his better judgment, he hadn’t been able to resist getting started on a little preliminary experimentation with his new shadow clone technique, before bed. The scroll had said something about his chakra dividing evenly between the clones, so in order to begin determining his total “clone capacity”, in an approximate sense, he first summoned a single clone, which he presumed should have half of his total chakra, and then had that clone summon another itself, which he could guess should either contain one quarter or one third of his total chakra—depending on whether it divided up its chakra with its summoner, or with his entire pool across all three bodies.

> He continued summoning, copies branching off himself one by one in a chain, until the seventh clone said that he was unable to summon an eighth. Since Naruto knew he could supply a lot more than eight clones in a single instance, and he’d had most of a day to recover from the exhaustion, this observation seemed to confirm that his entire chakra pool probably wasn’t just rebalancing itself with every cast, and therefore that the sequence in which he summoned his clones might actually be relevant, if he didn’t want to waste chakra where it wasn’t necessary, or find half his clones had run out of energy in the middle of a fight.

> He dispelled the last three clones by having them bite down moderately-hard on their own tongues, which seemed like the fastest safe way to reliably inflict enough damage to dispel one. Then, he had the fourth copy of himself attempt to use all of his chakra summoning out as many clones as he could, all at once, just like he’d done last night. He assumed that if the seventh couldn’t afford to make even one, then with the pool size effectively halved at each step, the fourth body should have had enough chakra for eight more bodies, at most.

> From this mistake Naruto learned the importance of proper experimental protocol. Dozens of densely packed copies burst into existence in the cramped quarters of his tiny apartment, crammed in on top of each other, limbs splayed. His desk collapsed under their weight, shattering every glass and plate he’d left out, the sharp edges of which combined with the crumpling of the pack to do enough damage in the ensuing chaos that he couldn’t even make out a rough headcount. That was most of his savings, gone.

> Those that were left tried to clean up some of the mess, but within less than a minute they had almost all vanished again, either accidentally cutting themselves or running out of energy, like from the chakra exhaustion he’d experienced last night, only this time there were still three healthy bodies still standing at the end of it—the first three versions of him, still unaffected by all the exertions of their brothers.

> The third was even successfully able to resummon a fourth, who summoned a fifth, who summoned a sixth. The sixth was unable to create a seventh, this time.

> The six of him looked around the wreckage of their room, uncertain what to make of all this, but diligently recording it all for the sake of later analysis. One idea was that there might be some large “fixed cost” associated with casting the technique in the first place, and then only a small extra price for each additional clone, which would explain why he’d been unable to cast it at all with a clone who should have had something like one sixty-fourth of his total chakra (minus whatever costs had been incurred along the way).

> He figured that the scroll probably would have warned him if the technique cost a minimum of half your total chakra every time you used it, and if the chakra was splitting up, he suspected that what was unspent might be returned along with the new memories that came when a clone burst, which also seemed to imply that it might spread out evenly, as the memories seemed to, rather than all going back to the direct summoner of that particular body. A quick test by dispelling the sixth and then finding himself unable to resummon it from the fifth body seemed to suggest the same, and was consistent with newly made clones having only the memories of their summoner.

> So, when created, a clone seemed to duplicate the mind and split the chakra with the single direct ancestor who created it, but on death its chakra and memories rejoined evenly with all the rest of his active bodies. Simple enough.

> It would take a lot of meticulous testing before he could be very sure of anything, but he decided that for the rest of the night he would leave the present five active as long as possible, to see how long it took for them to run out of chakra and die. He knew from experience now that there was a cost associated with maintaining the extra bodies, and between these five clones he could have a range of chakra pool sizes spanning a factor of ten or more, which he could gather data from even as he slept. There probably wasn’t any risk of total chakra exhaustion—his “oldest” body should still retain roughly half of his total chakra intact, which the Hokage had implied would be more than enough for anyone.

> But to his surprise, only one of the clones had disappeared by morning. He had intended to dispel any that were left, but his curiosity wouldn’t allow him to start getting ready for the day without at least a quick investigation. The fourth clone, last-summoned and thus most-nearly-exhausted, had no trouble paying the price in chakra to summon another duplicate.

> He couldn’t tell yet from his messy notes whether that was because the fifth had fallen asleep with so much less chakra left than the fourth, or whether his natural chakra regeneration was also being carved in half at each step down the line, but if it was the latter… then that could potentially be very interesting. If even a tiny fraction of his regeneration could fully counteract a whole night’s worth of steady burn, well then just how many shadow clones might he be able sustain if he made them all from his first body? The scroll hadn’t said anything about using the technique for extended periods, but if unusual regeneration came alongside his unusually-large chakra pool, well, that might open up all sorts of strange avenues. He might even be strong enough to survive to jounin rank, if he could figure all it out fast enough.

> Over the next few days Naruto continued his eager explorations of the shadow clone technique’s rules, painstakingly filling page after page with measurements of his chakra capacity, and of his clones’ capacity under various different conditions, and of his rate of apparent chakra regeneration, and of his clones regeneration, and how fast his chakra depleted with various numbers of clones active…

> Most ninja probably wouldn’t have been able to figure out as much as he could from such observations, but Naruto had long since mastered the elite jounin-level art known as Algebra—one of the few useful ancient skills still surviving. It made him feel strangely proud every time he used it—like he was wielding some tiny fraction of true power.

> Lacking any common currency with which to compare the quantities of chakra in his notes, Naruto decided that in the absence of any better system, he was allowed to invent his own. Thus, he declared that henceforth for all time one millichakra would be defined as the amount that a normal ninja regenerated naturally during one second, since he’d read in a guidebook for medic-nin that all ninja were known to regenerate chakra at the same rate, although it might take anywhere between one and four days to fully recover due to innate differences in total chakra capacity. Their observations apparently hadn’t included any jinchuuriki, like him, but the rest seemed mostly accurate.

> From his observations, it seemed that a single shadow clone cost about two millichakra every second to maintain, but really the minimum was more like four millichakra, in practice, since summoning a single clone necessarily seemed to mean maintaining the clone-effect over both bodies.

> His unnaturally quick recovery and overlarge chakra pool translated numerically to about 2,000,000 millichakra, in total, with 50 millichakra regenerating per second, between all his active clones. That was indeed significantly higher than the norm—as near as he could tell, regular ninja ranged roughly between one and three hundred thousand millichakra, meaning that he had about ten times the usual capacity, but as the Hokage had said: endurance battles were uncommon in the modern age. It was his regeneration rate which seemed most intriguing—even from complete exhaustion he could still recover within half a day.

> The up-front casting price of the shadow clone technique had also become clear: 20,000 millichakra, which he shortened in his notes to 20,000 mc, plus 1000 mc extra for each desired clone, suggesting that to exhaust himself within a minute or so of beginning his fight with Mizuki he would have had to summon nearly two thousand clones simultaneously—almost completely draining his reserves in an instant.

> It was convenient too that he could regenerate fast enough that his earliest observations weren’t even inconsistent with the newer data, despite having been made on the same day he recovered from chakra exhaustion.

> So, whereas a normal ninja might expect to maintain a single shadow clone for a little less than one day, at most (-2 mc/sec multiplied by two bodies, +1 mc/sec regeneration = roughly 180,000 mc burned over 17 hours, plus the 22,000 mc casting price), Naruto could theoretically summon himself a shadow clone and then just walk around in two bodies at once, forever, recovering chakra faster than he spent it. In fact, he could have up to twenty-five such parallel lives, simultaneously.

There’s more describing what Naruto starts to do with his 25 parallel lives, in which Naruto doesn’t rest easy with his game-breaking powers, he actually starts to break the game **as fast as possible**, which is a damn good thing because the ninja world is DANGEROUS and in fact later in the story Naruto regrets being *too slow* in setting up his chakra factories, when Kisame attacks and they have to take the fight to Pein sooner than intended.

No one *warns* Naruto he needs to speed up…he just thinks it’s a good idea because the world is dangerous…Kisame doesn’t *send him a warning*, and neither will asteroids, or AGI, or plagues, or new social media platforms.

(Incidentally, this is an advantage of serial web fiction versus physical books. Naruto-in-a-book's final battle can't come until close to the end, and since the reader knows there's no reason for Naruto to hurry if he's in the middle chapters, it won't seem wrong for Naruto to take his time. But in a serial web novel, you have no idea how close you are to the end; story-ending threats can come out of nowhere.)

Literally the **only reason** you can’t do **exactly what Naruto did** is the *ninja magic* part.

I haven’t read all the books in the world, but I’m just going to go ahead and declare this to be the best depiction of the scientific method in all of literature. Post counterexamples in the comments. I fucking dare you. If you give me better books to read I’ll become TOO POWERFUL 

**********

I’m fucking lazy and don’t like to write stuff down.

Genuinely, whenever I find myself thinking, *I should do some simple tests and record some results, the tests are cheap and some quick numbers will be such a big help in focusing my inquiries*, it is often a memory of *The Waves Arisen* that takes this vague feeling and impels me to take action. 

After all, I wouldn’t want Naruto to think I’m *stupid*—

> This level of character intelligence cannot be faked at all, by any literary artifice.

> You cannot do it by namedropping cog-sci terminology, trying to signal that you are part of the rationalist ingroup, because reading those phrases will not teach anyone how to think. Even if they look up the phrase ‘planning fallacy’ online, you haven’t taught them to think from within your own writing, you have not shown-not-told intelligence and thereby sneezed it onto them.

> You cannot create recognizable, learnable intelligence by declaring that your characters use a technique and therefore win. Level 3 intelligence exists on the level of paragraphs, not whole plots. It is in how your character arrives at the next thought shown one paragraph later.

So there’s a very simple test for whether something is rational fiction:

> So if you’re not becoming more intelligent from reading a character’s viewpoint, not even a little, then the author must not be showing real intelligence.

Reading *The Waves Arisen* has legitimately made me less of a lazy dumbass.

Good job, Naruto.

  >So if you’re not becoming more intelligent from reading a character’s viewpoint, not even a little, then the author must not be showing real intelligence.

  There are... several flaws with that metric.

  Let's start by clarifying your definition of "becoming more intelligent."  Intelligence, as a concept, is difficult to nail down.  Here, you seem to be referring to "intelligence" as a collection of skills, rather than something inherent, which is an unusual definition (but one I largely agree with).

  So, "rational fiction is fiction that makes you more intelligent" becomes "rational fiction is fiction that teaches you a skill."  Here's where things become problematic, because what someone learns from a work is very subjective.

  Someone might already know the skill being taught: does that make the work less rational, because the reader already knows?  Someone might be reading the work for a second time; is it less rational because they have already absorbed most of the lessons from it?

  Someone who reads it might not appreciate the skill being taught, or finds that bit of prose boring and skips over it.  Is the work any less rational because the person reading it does not absorb the skill being conveyed?

  Finally, to go the other way, stories are very good at conveying experience.  A person can be completely wrong about everything, and still convey an idea of why they believe such a thing; does a work become more rational because the person has learned something about the writer's worldview, even if the writer is not thinking particularly rationally?

  It's true that *any* test for rational fiction is going to be subjective, but this test in particular seems to take that a lot farther than is useful.  A good test for rationality in fiction should not depend on what the reader already knows, nor their interest in learning a particular skill, both of which tests the question "Did this work teach me anything?" fails.
  ```

    What is your better metric?
    ```

    - u/Nimelennar:
      ```
      First, I'll distinguish "rational" from "rational**ist**," the latter category (in my opinion) better fitting the attempted "test" above.

      A *rational* story is one where the people and their motivations are realistic, their actions are plausible responses to the situations that they are placed in, given their motivations and intelligence, and the consequences of their actions are foreseeable given enough consideration (unless some twist is withheld, in which case, they still make sense in hindsight).

      As for a *rationalist* story, I would say that it is a story where the characters are shown to solve problems using rationalist skills, and the use of those skills is displayed in enough detail that someone who is unfamiliar with a particular skill could pick up the basics of that skill without reference to outside works, given the motivation to do so.

      The difference between this and the definition/test in the OP is that my definition describes *the text* (the characters, their actions, and how those actions are described to the reader) and the OP describes the *reader's reaction* to the text.  As people react differently when they read the same text (and even the same person can react differently to a text upon a second reading), using *reaction* seems like a less-than-useful way of categorizing a work.
      ```

        I like this definition of rational fiction, thanks for sharing it. It sounds quite a bit like what I would call good character development. :)

        I've noticed the current trend in rational fiction seems to be promoting stories with high IQ characters as the MC (the techy, sciency sort of smart). Strictly speaking, though, that's not required to tell a rational story. It would be fun to read fics with more diverse main characters, I suspect it would lead to some interesting plot ideas.
        ```

- u/CouteauBleu:
  ```
  To me, rational fic was always less about "learning" how to have these thought process and more about "representation"; I like rational fiction because it often has characters tackle problems the same way I do; so I empathize with the character more, which makes me like the story.

  By these criteria, Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure counts as rational fiction. [I'll let qntm explain](https://qntm.org/excellent):

  > And just look how well the whole concept is explained. By virtue of being dunces - and not just one dunce, two dunces who are able to talk to one another - the characters are able to communicate fairly complex concepts in relatively simple language, while simultaneously communicating the same to the viewers. At one end of this spectrum is a film like Primer where the characters are superintelligent and never slow down for anybody's benefit, the viewer's or each other's. Meanwhile at the other end, Bill and Ted lay it out in simple terms which anybody can understand. It's masterful. What's happening here is education.

  > You're locked in a cell. You decide to summon the door key into existence, through deliberate focus. You devote some energy to cause the key-shaped loop to form ahead of you in time, where you can reach out and take it. This far more satisfying than dumb luck. It means you, Bill and Ted, have agency, and are using your resources and recently acquired knowledge to your advantage. It demonstrates that you are learning.

  > Admittedly, in this first example, the idea of key theft does seem to loop on itself, inspiring Bill with his idea. Similar objections can be levelled at the tape recording stunt and the fax machine trick - the ideas to make the tape recording and send the fax obviously come from hearing the tape recording and receiving the fax respectively. But by the time Ted is closing his eyes and saying to himself, "Trash can, remember a trash can!" the process is complete and the characters are clearly able to pull causal loops out of the air at will. They've acquired a kind of superpower. They've transcended time travel.

  My goal for any rational fiction I may ever write will be to have at least one moment at least this clever yet simple.

  > This line is in the story just because Naruto actually wants to know if the die is weighted and this is how you do it.

  You need to roll a weighted die at least a few hundred times to even begin to see a reliable trend and it still can just be coincidence. It's very much not 'how you do it', especially in a time crunch. [Here's how you actually test a die for balance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HhFz7fsFKk).
  ```

  - u/timecubefanfiction:
    ```
    I thought about this as well, even if Naruto is rolling the die really fast it doesn't seem like he has time to get more than 20-30 rolls in before he pelts it at Kakashi. This isn't actually too far from how many rolls he needs but he doesn't know enough math to know that.

    It might have been interesting if Naruto had noticed he doesn't have enough rolls, or if he had some idea that he *might* have enough rolls *if he knew what to do with the data*. There's one or two scenes later in the story, including a die-rolling one, where he does think something like "I bet there's a way to solve this but I don't know the math and can't figure it out right now." Then he could have thought, "Okay, the rolling isn't working, is there some way I can test the weight of the die by testing its *weight*?" Then he could have tried balancing it on his knife or something.

    On the other hand, I also like the idea that even if you don't know much math and even when you can't think of an elegant test, you can still just pick the dumbest, most obvious route and start plugging away at running trials and gathering data. There's a lesson there: *aim for the data and do the work*. And don't feel too bad when someone comes along later and shows you how much easier it would have been if you'd taken statistics in school instead of knife-throwing.
    ```

  Disclaimer: I didn't really like The Waves Arisen and didn't find it a rational story. Perhaps something about the writing turned me off, in any case I accept I'm biased.

  This is arguing more for rationalist fiction than rational, I guess - you're talking about how the main character is displaying virtues of rationality, rather than the setting / story making sense.

  >He employs quite a simple method of performing tests, writing down observations, and using those observations as a springboard for devising new tests. Simple math lets him take general ideas and turn them into specific hypotheses fit for implementation in areas where small differences in outcomes really matter, such as life-or-death battle

  This is in fact the part of the story that bothers me. It's a pure nerd wish fulfillment power fantasy, dressed with meaningless numbers. We're shown some very stretched reasoning, which is then taken for granted, and proves to somehow preemptively solve any problems Naruto might have. It's all a bit too much.
