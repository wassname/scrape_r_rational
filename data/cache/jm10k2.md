  The gym battles in this story are so goddamn entertaining. Every single one I'm on the edge of my seat, because I know you aren't afraid to have Blue lose, or have a Stormbringer attack the city mid-battle. I really thought for a second that it was going to be a draw, but that last scene was so...epic, for lack of a better word! 

  Also, I had a sneaking suspicion Erika was in on the Renegade thing. The way she was acting with Looker really gave off the idea that she wants to brush this whole thing under the rug as soon as possible. Also, looks like she might be onto Red about the whole uh, murder thing. 

  ...God I cannot wait for the next Red-centric chapter.

    I am curious how many other Leaders are in on it. Blaine and possibly Surge would be my guesses.
    ```

    - u/hbthebattle:
      ```
      Surge's mentality is almost like he expects an attack from Giovanni's faction, rather than being in on the conspiracy himself.
      ```

      - u/Radix2309:
        ```
        It is why I think only possible. Surge likes to be prepared, but he also seems to favor the legitimate chain of command which Giovanni is subverting.
        ```

        - u/hbthebattle:
          ```
          Surge likes to be prepared, but he also is far too involved in his city to risk it by allowing Renegades in the basement. Plus, when Blue brought up the idea of a Renegade attack, his reaction was [genuine confusion](http://daystareld.com/pokemon-73/)

          >!Plus, I suspect the only Gym Leaders in on it are the cities where the games have a significant or implied significant Rocket presence: Viridian, Saffron, Celadon, and Cinnabar (and Lavender but there's no gym there). That would make the Gym Leaders have an even 4/4 split on being in on the conspiracy.!<

              True, but they don't have a base in Cerulean, and only one was in the actual city, per se. I think it's more likely that the staging area of TR there was instead Mt. Moon.

    It really *should* be legal to temporarily become a renegade to kill another renegade to directly protect someone's life...
    ```

    - u/Trips-Over-Tail:
      ```
      I'm pretty sure it is, except that you don't become renegade when you do. The whole point of being made an outlaw is that the law no longer protects you. So while you can certainly be killed, legally you can't be murdered.

      Of course if you are in legitimate custody there are other rules, which would make breaking into a cell to kill a detained renegade definitely illegal, just not quite on grounds as straightforward as murder.

      Red's problem is more that if such a use of *sakki* should get out it would jeopardise Leaf's work and potentially empower renegades everywhere, not to mention annihilate any deniability Red might have about anything unpleasant that goes on around him, justifiably or not. Also, he likely does not want to be known as a killer, nor does he want Blue's friends to know that he psychically transformed their beloved Pokémon into lethal weapons.
      ```

      - u/AKAAkira:
        ```
        I think it's only MG whose vulpix he subverted for the killing - Lizzy's story that the pokemon the renegede sent after her turned on its own trainer doesn't have any elements contradicting it, yet.

        That said, I hope Red's able to find *some* way of appeasing MG's anxiety. Erika mentions this chapter that MG was visibly trembling as she accepted the medals for herself and Glen, and I suspect that's a good part caused by fear of someone finding out her vulpix killed a man (and possibly even wondering where she went wrong in training it) as it is caused by stage fright and imposter syndrome.
        ```

    - u/MilesSand:
      ```
      Renegades are people who train their pokemon to kill people.  It's not the murder, by itself, it's the fact that they trained a pokemon to be a murderer.  That's not something you can just switch on and off.
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        I know, I meant it should be legal to use a pokemon to kill a renegade to directly protect someone (which I thought would itself constitute being a renegade), but Trips-Over-Tail makes a good case that it's probably legal and Red is actually worried about something else.
        ```

- u/Memes_Of_Production:
  ```
  Since I didn't see any other comments on this, I will just note how great the literary trick was to set up Blue to reject a victory on chance midway through the fight, in a way that made him just a bit bitter but knew was the right call - then reverse course at the end & openly stake everything on luck, but in a way that was much more "him" (belief in his Pokémon over pure chance).  Its one of those quasi-subtle set-ups leading to payoff that is the hallmark of good structure, and I appreciate how often individual chapters have those kind of structural components over just being  a literal sequence-of-events.

  Erika's perspective was interesting. That beginning bit from when she was a child struck a chord with me. Something tells me she never changed her mind about time spent with Grandma. I hate the tendency people have to treat the feelings of children as invalid or irrelevant. The argument of "when you're older" especially annoys me.

  I think it is a shame she is working with Giovanni. Even if she's not inducted into his deep secrets like Sabrina, it is still a black mark against her. To make matters worse she is allowing him to continue to operate despite what happened and can't even claim any sort of ignorance anymore.

  Good to see Blue get back into things, even if Erika really didn't want him to win. She abused her position in that match in my opinion. 

  Anyway she is a deeply flawed person, but I enjoyed her perspective. I do look forward to getting back to Red and seeing how he's coping though.
  ```

  - u/Radix2309:
    ```
    Yes. She is clearly corrupt. Not in money; but power and favors. Manipulating status for her own ends.

  - u/ManyCookies:
    ```
    To me Erika comes across as... not exactly selfish or prideful, she clearly cares about others and is willing to take backseat on e.g the #WhatComesNext thing, but perhaps more *self-centered* than a gym leader should be.
    ```

    - u/PDNeznor:
      ```
      She's striking me with heavy Taravangian vibes, where she is all for the protection of those under her power, but is willing to bend moral boundaries and straight up sacrifice others for the benefit of her people.

  - u/Gummysaur:
    ```
    Yeah, I agree. Erika was really pushing every advantage she had in that match, with the coin flip thing (is that even allowed???) and trying to call a draw at the end. I like her character though, she’s pretty cunning for a character who’s always been portrayed as peaceful and chill in other media (I think. Never read the manga).
    ```

    - u/Leemorry:
      ```
      The coin flip thing was unconventional but allowed and justified.  
      And there was a draw at the end, she didn’t “try” to call it. When Blue’s arcanine got up, it was a gamble on his part, she did not know it would happen: they both thought it was a draw.

    Meh.... what's wrong with working with Giovanni from her perspective?\[who was instrumental in her becoming leader in the first place, as we learnt this chapter\]

    Yes, allowing renegades in the basement is illegal, but since there's some kind of corporate shadow-war behind the scenes, it's not unreasonable.Kanto has rule of law of sorts, but leaders, champions, elites and mega-corporations and other high-status people all sorta run around and do their own thing..... for what we've seen so far, good reasons.Are the more civilian, less warlord-equivalent elected mayors any better? Maybe, but Leaf suspects that a conspiracy of mayors might have been behind the Mt. Moon catastrophe.

    Bill openly admitted he sabotaged other AI research. Which might mean anything between hacking and deleting/falsifying data, doxxing, blackmail to straight-up murder.Or whatever a super-rich person could pull off to make you stop doing things. Maybe he just gave all promising AI researchers a lucrative scholarships in unrelated fields.

    \[we also have no good read on what Silph is up to, besides union-busting\]

    Kanto is kind of a morally grey place, unlike in the games.Giovanni is not a mobster. The Silph Co president is not a hapless victim.

    The whole region is a conspiracy theorist's paradise, because there's so many absurdly competent players, that actually pull of conspiracies.

    \---

    But yeah, that battle vs Blue was some unfair shenanigans.
    ```

    - u/Radix2309:
      ```
      Leaf thinks that, but she is out of the loop on a lot. Given the present info I would wager a guess that it is more likely the work of Giovanni's organization. 

      What is wrong is that one of the core Leader duties is passing judgement on Renegades. Very few others can do it. And in exchange for sparing some, they are reaping the rewards of them as labour for illegal activities. Well-meaning, maybe. But it is still flagrant corruption and incredibly anti-democratic.
      ```

      - u/DavidGretzschel:
        ```
        re: Mt MoonYeah, I'm pretty sure I have figured out, who killed Yuuta and who Palmer's source was. But I have no good idea, who ordered/commissioned the Mt. Moon robbery, in the first place. Maybe I'm missing some context from other games (maybe the Unova ones). But I don't think it was Giovanni himself. What would he get out of it? I have a possible motive, but it's a bit far-fetched.

        \---re: Erika being corrupt and anti-democratic

        Kanto isn't exactly a democratic society, though.

        It's more like a confederation of free city states, that are locally democratic.I think that the mayors might be elected, but the closest to a federal government would be the Indigo League and CorrNet.Corrnet is like.... a volunteer-run FEMA with local chapter everywhere. Or maybe a large-scale volunteer firefighter organization.And the Indigo league is half corporate wrestling franchise, half semi-professional militia except almost never directed against human threats.... actually, I struggle to find a good real world equivalent for the Indigo league.Their local chapters, the gyms, are more or less in harmony (and often in tension) with the local democratic/civilian elements.

        Together this all forms something like the Hanseatic league.And the democracy element is implied to be somewhat recent as pokeball tech used to not exist in living memory, meaning it was probably more warlord- and or psychic-dominated even back then.

        So what Erika has been doing is not anti-democratic. She's not acting against democracy/the civvies, she just considered the shady Giovanni/Silph-war to be none of their concern and hides it from them.

        I wouldn't call it corrupt or ethically misguided.\[maybe it is, but since I have no idea how good the civic/democratic institutions actually are I'm not assuming it\]
        ```

        - u/Radix2309:
          ```
          She is covering up illegal activity from the lawful authorities, she is corrupt. She even compared it to warlords.

          And regardless of how good the democratic institutions are, her behavior runs directly contrary to them, and to the principles of democracy in general. She is acting in a way that concentrates power in the hands of the few who defend their influence with force of arms.
          ```

          - u/DavidGretzschel:
            ```
            Power is always in the hands of the few and it is always defended. Sometimes with force of arms, sure. Mostly challenges to it don't require that, though.  
            I would judge any leader's moral worth not by from how their power is derived (or what the popular narrative is, how it's supposedly derived), but by how it is used.

            Giovanni and his cabal is doing admirably well, I think.
            ```

            - u/Radix2309:
              ```
              They are using that power to cover up illegal activity. Including murders. Not to mention the littany of other crimes Giovanni has committed up to imprisoning a new life form.

              Erika doesnt involve herself in the police, but in exchange she gets information. Presumably she is using this information in order to aid Giovanni in keeping the Rocket Renegades ahead of the authorities.
              ```

              - u/DavidGretzschel:
                ```
                Yes. That all falls under heroic responsibility ;)

                In the real world, we almost never see bad things done on a massive scale for good reasons.  
                And certainly we never see conspiracies of that scale work at all.

                But in-universe it makes perfect sense.  
                And yeah, if Giovanni's plan is so sensible and the world is more rationalist and more hardcore survivalist in general, the secrecy/murder stuff doesn't quite fit in, but this fiction has to work under the constraints of Giovanni being an elegantly dressed mobster wearing an expensive Italian suit..... so I dunno, I just have no trouble rolling with it.

                Samuel Oak alludes to Giovanni being extremely driven, but ultimately getting in the way of his own noble goals, because he just can't help being a cold fucking sociopath with trust issues. \[or something along those lines, don't quite remember\]  
                I hope that will be explored more, at some point.  
                Fits neatly into Blue's arc about wanting to become "the right Champion". He's probably going to be a little bit disillusioned with Erika, after the stunts she pulled.

        Ahh.... now I'm thinking of a spin-off with a "heroic irresponsibility"-theme. 

        Mewto turns against Giovanni and Sabrina and goes on a rampage. 

        Aeosis evolves into a Steelix and he loses control of it.  
        Bill unleashes Stuxnet to hinder Rocket-Casino AI research and creates Porygon, which starts a war against humanity and destroying the internet and box system.

        Groudon and Kyogre kill each other, but Wallace didn't notice this in time (the sky pillar is far away, after all) and he unleashes the titans for nothing. Surge's preparation for war succeeds too well, and Kanto starts preemptive strikes against Unova using hundreds of Abras (thanks Red!).  
        Aiko survives, accidentally reveals Sakki to Rei and she leads the surviving gym members to form a psychic clan and conquer Saffron and from there Lavender town.  


        And Erika.... accidentally gets herself and all her people addicted to her Bayleaf's tea. (turns out it was too good!)

  I initially thought that this will be a Red focused chapter as it has been 8 chapters since the last one. I was very surprised at seeing another interlude, but it blew my expectations away and I found myself really enjoying the chapter. I especially loved the small teases to the actions of Red and Leaf as it shows that they both have something to hide since the incident in Hoenn. Looking forward to the next chapter and hopefully it is a Red focused chapter as I want to see how the tulpa has grown and Red's POV of the casino incident.

  Here's something I've been thinking about, and I think I'm seeing a theme here: in the Erika vs Blue match, Erika gets stymied by Blue's use of poison/toxic status moves.

  > It’s happening again, she realizes, noticing the way ludiculo is slowing. The houndoom’s poison has been doing its work, slowly but surely

   A *status* move. Erika is all about status, and in the start of the chapter we see her unhappy with Looker, Lance and Giovanni because her position is being undermined...or perhaps poisoned.

  Okay, what does Erika think about Koga then?


  EDIT: Btw the ff.net link is still bork
  ```

  - u/writersfuelcantmelt:
    ```
    Come to think of it, she didn't use many status type attacks at all... Maybe she's off her game. I mean, spikes I'd include, but no poison of her own (considered but never executed); no sleep, paralysis, or confusion. Odd!
    ```

      ```
      Erika's team was status light to begin with (only the vileplume was a big statuser, the rest basically just have leech seed and TM'd toxic), and Blue did a good job of being mobile at close range and not giving her a chance.
      ```

    - u/MilesSand:
      ```
      She decides the tactic won't be effective because pidgeot's whirlwind-back attack clears them out of the field.  Not sure if that was in there originally or edited in to clarify, but that seems to be her reasoning.  Once pidgeot is out she starts using status moves again but by that point the fight is nearly over.

  There's something about Erika that I have like a guttural kind of unease about. Like that somehow she's wrong and I'm not sure why like she's totally got this set up for ease of communications beyond current societal norms, she's working kinda around the system rather than arguably the intended way, but I think the thing that I have the most issue with is that she's not really a gym leader for the sake of being a gym leader. 

  Like it's a position that you're supposed to hold in order to protect the people of your city and region and like Erika kinda just didn't and like for petty personal power reasons which I find less forgivable than the more megalomaniac tendencies of Giovanni who is almost certainly an antagonist if not an outright villain. But Erika kinda just puts people in danger by being the leader both by not striving to be the strongest in a time where personal strength can and does save lives, but is also not enough in comparison to the known and feared threats that are expected. Like i dunno i wouldn't have a problem with her "leading" an apartment somewhere doing mostly the same things, but like there are expectations on her that she's not even trying to live up to.

  Also that like if her Third is the battling part of her leadership qualifications of Gym Leadership what happens if/when she dies, which we've seen happen to you know full Gym Leaders in the face of crisis(s?) or like if Erika dies and her little you know rationalist coven isn't seen as something the next Gym Leader wants? 

  More pedantically the Ferrothorn being returned out of ingrain is wierd. Also i'm not sure that the dramatic finish holds up when Golbat absent any conscious pokemon threatening his(her?) master is just able to wake up given time which considering all of the opposing pokemon are knocked but they are just asleep well... I mean sure in like anime sometimes was considered a knock out in the Indigo League but like that part feels kind of questionable like the enemy was defeated all he has to do wait and his golbat should just wake up.

  - u/daydev:
    ```
    Yeah, there's something eerie about her. There's several lines where it seems clear she does care about the people, but also there's this undercurrent like she cares about them like one may care about NPC companions in a video game, or pets. And what she really cares about is the status games, maybe with a side of selfish hedonism.

  Well damn, if Erika brought a team of five fully evolved pokemon, all dual-typed for a fourth-badge challenger, what the hell would she use against an eighth-badge challenger?

  Got the same feeling with Amy's challenge against Misty. I don't quite understand how the scaling works, considering there are no levels.

  Though given that there are no levels, it also means, that a fully evolved pokemon doesn't necessarily get much stronger than another one of its species....
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    Yeah levels are hard to translate to a world like this. None of the pokemon she uses need a high level to evolve except Cradily and Ferrothorn at 40, which feels justified to have as her strongest pokemon given how important they are to her team. In the games, when she's your 4th gym battle her pokemon are usually in the mid-30s.
    ```

    - u/ManyCookies:
      ```
      It does seem pretty difficult to construct a “fair” team without explicit levels, especially since leaders clearly don’t just have a set “2nd badge team” and adjust to the opponent. What happens if a leader accidentally overshoots the challenger?
      ```

      - u/DaystarEld:
        ```
        They do have a collection of pokemon that they pick from to form their teams based on badge number, but yeah the exact composition changes and picking that at the right level is part of what a skilled Leader should be able to do.
        ```

        - u/Radix2309:
          ```
          And even if they go a but over, they can hold back a bit to compensate.

          But most trainers would have to go through parts of the gym and the 2nd or 3rd, so they would be able to be observed and assessed before the match.
          ```

        - u/None:
          ```
          I kind of imagined that Leaders pick their teams for lower badge challengers on the fly. That wouldn't fit with how you portrayed it in the story, but would give them absolute control over who wins and loses.

          Afterall, if a challenger shows impressive skills but the Leader has "misjudged" a good counter team to them, the challenger gets punished for nothing. 

          Of course that only makes sense for lower badges like first and maybe second.
          ```

          - u/DaystarEld:
            ```
            I see it as like "There's ~10 pokemon I can pick from for Badge 1, ~20 for Badge 2, ~20 for Badge 3, ~30 for Badge 4," etc.

    In fact, I think [speculation that I give decent odds of being right but might be a spoiler if so](#s "since beldum were explicitly told to have been created wholesale out of an elementary school's stock of computers, Groudon and Kyogre may well have been pokemon-ified forms of the land and the sea.

          That's less wholesome than what I had in my head, but the fact that you're being open about that so the potential partner knows is nice. 

          You've done a bang-up job with presenting each gym as having it's own culture; this kind of worldbuilding informs a lot about the gym leader involved in each   
          "Arc" and the world feels that much more lived in.  

          Also, as a former competitive battler, I adore the way you manage to make every fully-evolved Pokémon a serious threat in battle. Ludicolo has never looked so threatening in a single battle.

            Glad you're enjoying the battles! It's a shame how few pokemon are actually "competitive" in the games, and it helps that I can play with "levels" and abilities a bit more to keep some semblance of relative power while still making certain pokemon a threat.

        Well, considering a large bird is creating enough wind to blow away an entire field's worth of metal caltrops, i think its safe to assume there's some wind magic shenanigans going on.

It could go either way.

      Sorry about that ;) It just seemed like a weird limitation... sure it would stop a pokemon from being blown away by Whirlwind or running away from Roar, but why would it stop a pokeball from working? The roots are still part of them, if being underground stops them from being withdrawn then a diglett wouldn't be able to be withdrawn unless its whole body was above ground.
      ```

      - u/anenymouse:
        ```
        I think that's a reasonable interpretation of game mechanics into a narrative that tries to be as reasonable as possible. But what is the deal with sleep being equivalent to a knock out? Like that seems exploitable to the point that it in a reasonable world someone would have well exploited it.
        ```

        - u/DaystarEld:
          ```
          It's a knock-out in the sense that it needs trainer intervention for them to wake up, and trainers aren't allowed to intervene in League matches. This rule I basically made up because otherwise people would just be spamming potions on their pokemon, because why not? So it's just one of the ways that trainer battles are less realistic than wild battles, but everyone accepts this for the sake of having a reasonable competitive framework.
          ```

          - u/anenymouse:
            ```
            Even then wasn't the challenge to beat her five which happened regardless of whether or not Blue's Arcanine was able to stand? I guess you could make the argument that it's not enough to be able to be the only living thing conscious regardless and it's admittedly a very well petty thing to be confused about, but like it feels within the constraints of the challenge he had won even before his Arcanine was proven still able to battle.

            But also if sleep is generally considered a knock out aren't you at least a little incentivized to teach your pokemon to use like Sleep talk? Or like winning your mastery challenge by putting all of your opponent's to sleep seems well possible and within the rules as written which seems like something someone intelligent could exploit.
            ```

            - u/DaystarEld:
              ```
              Blue points out that technically he did defeat all her pokemon, but the generally accepted winner has to still have a pokemon left capable of fighting at the end.

              I don't think Sleep Talk is a legal move in my world, even if it exists as a TM that pokemon can learn there's still no way for a sleeping pokemon to discriminate who it's attacking even if it could be given orders like "use body slam directly in front of you." And yes putting opponents to sleep is a common tactic, it's just high-risk-high-reward. The only one that's not legal in League matches are indiscriminate sleep attacks like Sing.
              ```

              - u/anenymouse:
                ```
                I'm just not convinced that sleep is high risk is the thing and that in comparison to most if not all other moves in a the League Matches as you said it only needs to land once and that pokemon is knocked out regardless if the opposing pokemon can like even damage them any further if given the chance which is weird. Also that it makes like the move Rest not a thing and while you have shown the like real world consequences of people being drowned in puddles previously like i'm not sure that the overall threat of said pokemon is portrayed accurately if that's the interpretation that you're going to consistently use.
                ```

                  Sorry, having trouble following the comment. Are you saying you're not sure that being put to sleep with a single inhale of powder is sufficiently dangerous, or something? When I said high risk I mean high risk to the person doing it, since if it misses it's a wasted "turn" and it's much easier to evade in a real setting than in the game.

  ...."If over three weeks of interrogation have not yielded any new information, what purpose is there to the continued delay?"

  \---

  I bet it has yielded loads of information, but Erika isn't being briefed, because of information security :)

    Anonymous fund for the families of those lost? Wouldn't be too weird to have one specifically for those that died in the Casino, given how unusual it was.

    Basically anyone who was downstairs might have seen something they shouldn't have.

      Yeah, but from Rakim's perspective we know that there was a kill-order for sub basement 3. Anyone above those levels would simply be turned around and thrown out. Lizzy didn't see anything apart from generators, which weren't a secret (as far as we know). Rakim was in sub basement 3 and could not reach anybody for guidance on that and decided to apply that rule, thinking that Archer could still be able to hide or spin the existence of the lower levels, if there are no witnesses left alive to contradict that his account.  Rakim that got knocked out by Joy was also in sub basement 3 (I think?). So he either reasoned in the same way or he and Roark coordinated at some point.

      The generators are in sub basement 1 (that was my conclusion, last I read this, anyway). No kill order there. So the third renegade Maddie would have to have been extremely ruthless and very cool-headed, thinking that she can't allow the girl asking where the generators are, to fix them.Quite the psycho, considering that this would help in digging out her own colleagues and friends (and their Fantasy Indigo League!).

      More likely that she got the order from Archer (or maybe even Giovanni), who presumably survived and left Celadon. \[or has already been captured by Looker\]

      \---re: weregildYeah, I suppose. It's a risk, I think. Something that Looker might end up looking into :)

  Completely unrelated question to this chapter; in Chapter 59, there's a renegade programmer Giovanni interviews that his personal psychic finds untrustworthy: 

  >*Sincere*, he sends, the wait already having gone on for a few seconds longer than customary. *But there’s something about him that seems inherently hard to pin down. I would not trust him.* 

  Did you have a specific mental disorder in mind when you wrote that renegade? Or just a vague antisocial/emotional detachment mix?
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    I basically modelled him as a narcissist, someone who would seem fine as long as he was flattered and his skill acknowledged, but who held himself as inherently superior to everyone else and would not work well with others or take criticism/restriction.

  Great chapter, though I'm not a fan of what Erika suggested to simulate the chance of Blue escaping with his Breloom. Guessing fingers is something too easy for her to fake and decide how the challenge ends. If the intended implication is that she's that blatantly abusive of her status, then it works and I like it, but if it was meant as a genuine attempt to give him a coin flip there are definitely better ways imo.

  Off the top of my head, she could grab a spare pokeball from nearby and have Blue guess whether it contains one of two species.

  That last bit with Soul roaring was great though, super awesome!

  Quite late, but just started reading this chapter today. Thanks Daystar!

  > Before. That the word has gained such weight in everyone’s collective thoughts and dialogue speaks volumes in itself of the times they’re living through. Within a day of the weather gods’ abrupt arrival and departure, it became clear to Erika that any major plans she had for the next few months would have to be delayed or reconsidered. By the next week she realized that her plans for the whole year might not survive the changes taking place around the island, and it only got worse from there as the changes, both ecological and social, continued to make themselves known around the world.

  > Now, nearly a month later, Erika has begun to realize that rather than expecting things to go back to “normal,” she would have to make her plans around a new concept of what normal is.

  This was wow. I got frisson. Reminds me of COVID. Have a hug.

  > She doesn’t understand why handshakes are even still a thing; unhygienic, inconvenient if your hands are full, no set protocol for grip length or strength, and downright unpleasant if either person is sweating. All the potential downsides of a hug with none of the benefits.

  Made me laugh. Also COVID.

  Anyway... as someone who doesn't pay much attention to the world, I'm wondering, why do gym leaders ever lose? Shouldn't they easily defeat any kid? Is it because they have pokemon of one type? (Really realistic story, by the way, enjoying Red and Mewtwo, I hope Giovanni is stored in a pokeball at some point...)

    There's three levels of challenge: Mastery, Membership, and Leadership. Mastery and Membership challenges are meant to test the challenger rather than being the Leader going all-out.

  Is it just me or does this battle have more technical mechanics from the game than a lot of the others? I think someone been playing in Showdown recently :)
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    Nah, I haven't played Pokemon in quite a while. If anything I feel like this battle plays the most loose with pokemon mechanics, like Whirlwind removing spikes, or being able to withdraw a pokemon with Ingrain (which always seemed like an arbitrary limit, to me).
    ```

    - u/GreenSatyr:
      ```
      All true, but I'm impressed just by the fact that you know about Ferrothorn, the fact that its ability is iron barbs, and leading with Spikes, the fact that some breloom don't get poisoned, etc. That's a fair bit of trivia to know for someone who doesn't play, and I think the ferrothorn bit is even relevant in the current meta.

      (Though, I'm always amused when powerful people keep using Water Gun in this story! Pretty sure it is strictly overshadowed by hydro pump, surf, and scald / my impression was that some moves like water gun and ember are more for the sake of move progression in game in the low levels)
      ```

      - u/DaystarEld:
        ```
        Yeah that's actually intended! There are a ton of moves that trainers don't use in battles with each other because they would otherwise be too deadly to the opposing pokemon :)
        ```

        - u/Trips-Over-Tail:
          ```
          Is that why Elite Four and Champion battles are deadly? They're going full-out?
          ```

          - u/DaystarEld:
            ```
            Yep.
            ```

            - u/Trips-Over-Tail:
              ```
              I assume Leadership battles are similar? Are there other battle types that are expected to carry the same risk?
              ```

              - u/DaystarEld:
                ```
                Just those two, since they're the ones where trainers are defending their positions. Pokemon might die in other matches, like Elite battles, but it's not because nearly anything is allowed.
                ```

              - u/HeroOfOldIron:
                ```
                Yep, I forget exactly what chapter it was but during the fight with the renegade at Mt. Moon, his pokemon used Slash, an explicitly deadlier version of Cut.
                ```

                - u/Trips-Over-Tail:
                  ```
                  Yes... but full contact skirmishes with renegades targeting opposing trainers is not quite the League-sanctioned battle format I was inquiring after.
                  ```

        - u/GreenSatyr:
          ```
          :o thats a great reason!
          ```

    - u/Trips-Over-Tail:
      ```
      Using Whirlwind to remove spikes was basically just the Flying-type status move Defog, which is likely performed in much the same way anyway. Since you don't seem to be imposing a strict move limit I'd say it's fine, though it seems odd that Erika would consider it a use of Whirlwind unless Blue has actually just invented Defog.
      ```

      - u/DaystarEld:
        ```
        Yeah the decision to give some flying pokemon Gust/Whirlwind but not Defog always struck me as weird, but I figured that Blue teaching his pokemon how to effectively mimic it with a similar move would be interesting. Instead I might just say fuck it and declare that "Defog" is the name of the same sort of attack that's directed at objects instead of other pokemon.
        ```

        - u/Trips-Over-Tail:
          ```
          It's weird that there isn't a Psychic version of that move, especially considering how many versions of Protect there are. Of course, in your version a skilled enough Pokémon might well be trained to use Psychic to lift all the field traps and bombard their opponent with them.
          ```
