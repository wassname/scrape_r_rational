## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  I've been reading [Doors to the Unknown \(Worm/D&D, Fusion/Crossover\)](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/doors-to-the-unknown-worm-d-d-fusion-crossover.1001110/page-15?post=83949900#post-83949900). It's a incredibly well written fusion between the two settings. It explores how the two settings bleed into each other, explaining worm's ~~superhero~~ >!cosmic horror!< setting in terms of DnD metaphysics.

  The characters are fantastic, there are two main POV's Taylor and Valigan. Taylor is not the usual memetic "escalation" Taylor
  most worm fanfics write her as and Valigan is a charming and experienced academic with his own issues and strengths, not an OP outside context problem author insert.

        And D&D genre savvy, which sometimes works quite well in the Potterverse -- he successfully identified characters who would turn out to be plot relevant by asking himself, "How many adjectives would I use to describe this person?" He almost kicked himself for not noticing earlier that Quirrell was a major character; obviously someone with a stutter, a turban, *and* an odor of garlic was destined to play some crucial role.

  [Dungeon Meshi](https://mangadex.org/title/d90ea6cb-7bc3-4d80-8af0-28557e6c4e17/dungeon-meshi) is phenomenal and you all should read it.

  On its surface, it's a story about a hapless adventuring party that needs to quickly rescue the corpse of one of their members from a dragon's stomach before it becomes so degraded they can no longer resurrect her. However, they're broke and unable to buy supplies, so they join forces with an eccentric dwarf who's lived in a dungeon for years and become an expert at monster cuisine. The characters are eccentric and lovable, the art is gorgeous, the worldbuilding is incredibly in-depth, and of course it's very funny.

  And then it just gets so, so much deeper, literally and figuratively. Every little throwaway line about character backgrounds is eventually satisfyingly incorporated into the story and tidbits of random worldbuilding end up being critical an arc later.

  In some ways, it reminds me a little bit of "Made in Abyss" in that it's a deceptively lighthearted tale about a descent into an unknown darkness, though Dungeon Meshi has a more clasically heroic spin to it.

  I have a few requests:

  Firstly, some good long/completed isekai. Doesn't have to be rational per say but just not a ego-centric power trip protagonist. It can have an OP protagonist if they're not waxing soliloquies about changing the world and are just enjoying themselves like Kamitachi ni Hirowareta Otoko.

  Second, any good audiobooks or podcasts. I'm a little burnt out on the ones I have on my to-read list. Preferably I'd like something light hearted like How To Defeat A Demon King by Andrew Rowe. 

  Third, more litrpg stories. Just like isekai I can't seem to get enough of them.

  Fourth, I'd like to recommend Threadbare. It was recommended to me on a previous Monday thread and I love it. Not the most rational characters themselves but they're all believable humans (and non-humans). It's cute, it's funny, it has the right amount of levity for the serious moments. 10/10.
  ```

    ```
    Link for the lazy: [Threadbare](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/15130/threadbare). By the way, shouldn't it be "Threadbear"? Seems amusing, I may give it a try.
    ```

    - u/Master_Gazelle_6068:
      ```
      Sorry. Running on 0 hours of sleep. Thanks for posting the link.

      The story does get pretty punny with the name but it's called Threadbare because that's the name of the MC.

    Second post for a second recommendation I remembered, but[ Only Villains Do That](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/40182/only-villains-do-that) might be worth looking into. It's getting on to book 3 right now, so decently long too. Basically it's a deconstruction/reconstruction of shlocky paint-by-numbers Japanese Isekai stories that get rolled out by the hundreds, by taking the most common tropes from all that and slotting them into a world that is consistent with their appearance (tropes like harems, casual slavery, bandits everywhere as mooks, "chosen one" setups, explicity deities intervening in the world, protagonist gets isekai as the "Dark Lord" instead of hero and has to fight an uphill battle to not be dismissed out of hand, etc.). In other words, large swathes of the world is a hateful shithole filled with discrimination and abuse, chacterised by a dramatic class divide ruthlessly enforced, while both the upper echelons of political power and the twin "good/evil" Goddesses above them play with people like pawns for their own entertainment.

    It's pretty well done overall. The "chosen one" magic boon the protagonist gets access to is basically being able to mash existing spells together into new combinations, which opens the door to the type of results that would appear to browsers of this subreddit. They also stumble across (read: Goddess bullshit setup) a top-tier healing spell right from the start, which is used as arguably the basis of all their power, which instanteous line-of-sight or personal full recovery would obviously be used for whenever someone with half a brain had access to it. This also leads into the combination of a small fire spell for starting fires and the healing spell into a new way to commit warcrimes by making a spell that ignites and heals someone simultaneously, torturing them horrifically until they splutter out, which is probably the second most used spell by the protagonist, with fully felt repercussions and trauma for everyone involved.

    I'm pretty sleep deprived right now and haven't given this the summary it deserves, but it's popped up in previous recommendation threads, so maybe do a quick search through those if you want to know more.
    ```

    - u/Master_Gazelle_6068:
      ```
      Just curious. In the second chapter there is:

      “Imagine it, if you can! Absolute power, the ability to do anything you can think of… But only on one world. You can’t leave, can’t explore the cosmos, can’t even die. How long do you think it would take to run out of every possible thing there is to do?”

      How does this explain them altering space-time in Japan and plucking people out of it? Is that an exception? If they can do that why can't they leave or explore the cosmos?
      ```

      - u/gramineous:
        ```
        If someone claims absolute power, then immediately says some things are impossible for them, that's not absolute power, they're lying. 

        There's stuff revealed later in the book of people who have got one over on the goddesses before in major ways (that then get the wider knowledge of this declared taboo to nix spread of it), but really, when someone tries to torture and threaten the main character into obedience, then claims absolute power and that resistance is futile, they don't look that trustworthy to me.
        ```

        - u/Master_Gazelle_6068:
          ```
          A fair point. I was just wondering if it was inconsistency on the part of the author or explained further down the road. I wouldn't trust either of the goddesses
          ```

          - u/chiruochiba:
            ```
            Thus far the author has been very good at not writing inconsistencies. If you notice a character say something false/iffy (prime example: most of the protagonist's misanthropic monologues) then later on the story will prove the depths of their folly. In fact, exploring and learning from false assumptions is a major theme throughout the story.
            ```

    - u/Master_Gazelle_6068:
      ```
      I'm definitely hooked off of how you described it so don't worry. I'm off to read about war crimes now.
      ```

      - u/gramineous:
        ```
        I mean if that's what interests you, [Ouroboros Record](https://www.yamitranslations.com/p/ouroboros-record-circus-of-oubeniel_62.html?m=1) would be up your alley. Protagonist dies and is reincarnated in your standard brutal medieval fantasy world, except he remembers the process of reincarnation and is thoroughly traumatised by the experience, and commits himself to finding immortality. At any cost.

        The translation is only mediocre in quality, but given the protagonist is completely amoral, and commits acts at home alongside Unit 731's atrocities in his dedication to research, the translation quality makes it readable without visceral disgust.

        It's not the best written story, but I've kept an eye on it for years out of a morbid curiosity in how far the story will go, and what new horror will happen next, and because it all happens with a rather detached protagonist rather than the typical villainous protagonist of someone motivated by revenge or absurdly justifying their own actions. Someone that doesn't consider the morality of their actions worth any consideration is a far cry from normal stories.
        ```

    - u/NTaya:
      ```
      Seconding this really hard, it's my favorite ongoing story on the RoyalRoad right now.

      With that said, it's an *incredibly* slow burn and is, like, midway into its second arc at 500k words. I love stories like this which take time to flesh out every character and direct the reader to very minor worldbuilding details, as well as having *many* overarching plots. But I understand that it's not to everyone's taste, and I know that some people on this subreddit have put it down due to glacial pace. But again, in my opinion, it's excellently done glacial pace.

    Listened to the Kaiju Preservation Society last week. Which is both an excellent performance, and also lighthearted, and good. 

    The murder-bot adaptions are good, and if you are looking for a good dose of whimsy, the (ancient) BBC radio adaptions of the Peter Wimsey stories are excellently done.

    One of my favorite isekais and litrpgs is definitely [The Calamitous Bob](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/44132/the-calamitous-bob). It’s light on the numbers, but I think it greatly improves the experience as it’s less about arbitrary bullshit numbers the author will continue to make up and more meaningful and fluid. Numbers are still used to signify improvements and certain thresholds and power levels. The writing is phenomenal and really uplifts the normal premise: A French combat medic gets isekai’d into a fantasy world and becomes a black mage. I really like it as there’s not a lot of novels that tackle normal premises like just being a black mage or so on. Bob is like the typical litrpg isekai formula, but done well, which is why I enjoy it so much. There’s no idiot balls or dumb decisions, and the MC generally is pretty rational, I’d say.

    Another of my favorites is the Light Novel series So I’m a Spider, So What? Monster litrpg isekai, and it pulls off those elements pretty well. It’s my favorite in how it plays with and deconstructs those elements, which I haven’t seen any other series do.

    > long/completed isekai

    Have you read [Ar'Kendrythist?](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26727/arkendrithyst) People don't like it too much here because the protagonist starts off as the opposite of what people here want: impulsive, naive, not cautious, pacifistic, etc. But if you are okay with that start it becomes one of the best webnovels I've ever read. 

    Protagonist, who is in his mid 40s, takes a long time to settle his moral dilemmas with the isekai world (evil existing, people and monsters needing to be killed, etc), but it does happen slowly. It's a long character arc, with him finding a more precise line in the sand that is compatible with his morals. Along with that, there's a lot of rational world building. Magic can be done in many ways, and all those ways are explored deeply, and the weaknesses and strengths of those ways are contextualized in real world history and geography. The story goes through many different settings that are unique, and actually well described. The author's prose and imagery are really good for webnovel standards. 

    The characters are really good, if a bit atypical. Protagonist is a paragon of moral goodness, and acts that way. OP protagonist, but it has some really nuanced takes on how an up and coming OP protagonist can change and improve a world where immortals and other mages-of-mass-destruction exist. The introspection is quite good, and sometimes even inspiring. A lot of the time I find that the readers *and* the characters around the protagonist urge him towards more violence, but somehow he keeps his cool and chooses the more adult decision even if it feels lame in the moment. The other characters have their own quirks, but the author manages to keep those quirks without making the characters feel like caricatures. All of them are pretty three dimensional, and have motives and feelings that are believable for their position. 

    The pacing of the story is rock solid, if slow. It's like 50% slice of life and 50% epic politics, magic, action. There is always stuff happening and the characters working towards new plot goals, but the story takes its time savouring the small moments in between too. It also gets continuously better. The author starts off with pretty good prose and imagery, but he really hones his craft through the story, and the current chapters are as good as some of the really good published fantasy novels I've read. I'd also say they satisfy what people want in a rational story. Protagonist has developed a lot and acts rationally now, although his moral principles haven't changed. Characters and antagonists act rationally too, and that results in a lot of politics that's fun to read.
    ```

    - u/TornSkippito:

      Can concur. This is one of the stories I most look forward to reading every week. If you can get past the beginning and enjoy long form fantasy, it's a wonderful read.
      ```

    - u/ClockworkGolem:
      ```
      I was one of the people who was turned off by the beginning of Ar'Kendrythist, for exactly the reasons you mention. I dropped it after just a few chapters, but I think I'll pick it back up for another try on the strength of your recommendation here.
      ```

      - u/Dragfie:

        I was turned off too, but just skipped the first few chapters and now I'm a patron
        ```

    - u/Master_Gazelle_6068:
      ```
      I'll definitely check it out then. I always love when a story delves into the nitty gritty of how a magic system works.

      What do you mean that the readers urge him more towards violence? Is it a group participation story?
      ```

      - u/CaramilkThief:
        ```
        It's not a group participation story. I meant more in that the comments for the chapters expect and urge violence, and sometimes that happens within the story too where the party members or people around the protagonist want him to escalate violence. That almost never happens though, which I really liked. The story gives a lot of thought to the value of a life, and situations where the only solution is to kill are rare and impactful.

    Have you read [*The Wandering Inn*](https://wanderinginn.com/)? Probably the platinum-standard for western isekai and web serials generally (up there with *Worm*). It's also very, *very*, long. Millions and millions of words. Probably the longest English language fiction *in history* and it has very well done audiobook adaptations too that are totally worth the audible credits. 

    As for the actual story, it's fantastic, especially the range of emotional reactions it elicts from me, the reader. I laughed, I cried, etc. Just unbelievable. I could go on for ages about how much I love it.

    Only minor criticism/caveats I have for it is that because it's so long, it's very detailed. We get lots of different perspectives, many different characters, hundreds of plots, and it's such a phenomenally big world that it's difficult to keep track of everything. Also for the /r/rational crowd, there are some points where it might get a bit... difficult to read because the characters don't always make smart or rational decisions. This doesn't make the work "irrational" because the choices are in-character, but it can be frustrating to read (especially early Ryoka).
    ```

  - u/gramineous:
    ```
    Delve is an isekai litrpg. It gets a lot of hate though, but the vast majority of it is because it has a weekly update schedule when it'd need 2x or 3x weekly updates to have a decent speed of plot progression, so many people trying to keep up with the updates often grow frustrated. It's a lot better to sit down and pour through a bunch of it at once though. Also, the protagonist shies away from violence more than is arguably appropriate for the world and/or his situation, which people find grating to read, even if it's not too far-fetched for an actual person to be reluctant as such, versus your standard isekai protagonist murderhobo fare.

    Crunchy numbers though.
    ```

    - u/degenerate__weeb:
      ```
      I enjoyed binging Delve up to around chapter 110. The munchkinry and system crunchiness were my main draws. After that point, the main character just felt like a living shitpost. Even after a long learning-to-speak-the-local-tongue arc, he consistently spews out internet memes that no one else understands. That plus the glacial plot progression made me drop the story.
      ```

- u/nikic:
  ```
  [A (Not So) Simple Fetch Quest](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/48951/a-not-so-simple-fetch-quest) is a LitRPG featuring a protagonist who respawns on death. Of course, that just means that threats shift towards restriction of freedom (of action or will). Unsurprisingly, the ability to respawn on death shifts the value system of the protagonist rather thoroughly, making this a peculiar read.
  ```

  - u/Dragongeek:
    ```
    Thanks for the recommendation. Just finished reading it. Here are my thoughts:

    Overall, an enjoyable and fun quick read. Not terribly complex, and a blatant power fantasy, but still a self-contained story with a distinct structure and an actual ending unlike lots of web-fiction. The writing is average to good, although voice and style could use some work. 

    The best way to describe it would be Azarinth Healer combined with the ability to resurrect instead of heal and with better writing and plot. Also, be warned that there is a *lot* of extreme fetish-fuel in there yet it astonishingly never gets particularly explicit. This is acknowledged in the text and makes sense though, because >!the whole world is formed from the protagonist's wishes and she's *really* into bondage.!<

  Binged a couple top ranked royal road fictions recently:

  - [Epilogue](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21374/epilogue), complete, a novella about three kids returned to their bodies after 7 years spent in "Narnia". Not a happy story, but good.

  - [Fox's Tongue & Kirin's Bone](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/42226/foxs-tongue-and-kirins-bone) an incredibly written ongoing fantasy, with characters that at least so far seem true to their motivations basically all the time. More than one reveal in this story of a secret/twist that made everything make so much sense, and yet I did not see it coming until very very late. Strongly recommended.
  ```

  - u/Judah77:
    ```
    Epilogue was not for me.  It focused more on teen drama and flashback mystery than the genre I expected it to be.
    ```

  - u/Luonnoliehre:
    ```
    Both of these are great. Epilogue is like an anti-fantasy, a book about fantasy while having basically no fantasy in it. It's intensely character driven and a unique take on the isekai trope.

    I recently read Fox's Tongue and there a lot of things to love. The world and mythos is deep and there's a level of intrigue where it really feels like the MC can't trust anyone, which is great. The one thing that did bother me was that the author withholds information a lot to make the story more suspenseful. If the MC doesn't know something that's fine, but it takes me out of the story when we don't hear about certain actions from the MCs point-of-view to make a "reveal" more dramatic. Similarly, there are aspects of the world that the MC clearly knows about, but again, the reader is kept in the dark and I feel like I'm still trying to understand basic facts about the world at times. But the mysteries ensure you keep reading so it is very engrossing.

- u/Unable_Discussion916:
  ```
  I have finally gotten around to read Vigor Mortis (around chapter 137). It’s a relatively good story, but its only rational theme is its advocacy of transhumanism and immortality.

  &#x200B;

  One of the main characters is pretty competent and selfish, but they don’t drive that much of the plot. Other characters are anything but rational. The MC has god-level powers, which let them mind-slave people from a range with few short-term external symptoms. They almost exclusively use this ability in self-defense. They don’t even bring their few slaves to fights for fear of losing them. (Fights they thus lose.) They go along with plans that have already failed their critical enablers (e.g., the plan is to kill someone alone, but they are not alone). They regularly help their known future adversaries for frivolous reasons such as them being beautiful.

  &#x200B;

  The MC is almost always reactionary and not actively looking for ways to better their chances. This point even gets mentioned in the later chapters in a self-reflection, but it never results in any changes. It would be too late anyway by that point.

  &#x200B;

  The MC consistently fails. Pretty much all their successes can be attributed to plot armor and their raw power, in spite of their shitty strategies.

  Aside from the above, the story has some conventional problems as well. There are Delve-style useless PoVs which compromise almost half the story. The main emotions all feel artificial and forced. E.g., whenever the MC’s stuffed animal is mentioned, the MC  acts like a man with anger management problems whose wife‘s honor has been questioned. The characters are all very quick to designate acquaintances as family members. This starts as a joke, gets repeated so much that it is cringe, and then the author  takes their own joke seriously and keeps repeating it with other characters. It feels like reading crack parody at times.

  Despite all of this, the story has its good elements, too. It’s enjoyable relative to most junk out there.
  ```

  - u/Nnaelo:
    ```
    >The main emotions all feel artificial and forced.

    This was the main deal breaker for me. I couldn't make it past around chapter 48. It was very clumsy in the way the story kept telling us to care about characters, instead of actually making us care about them.

    Which is a shame, because the setting in itself was interesting.

    Vita is so damn *unlikeable* It was interesting at the start when she was just a cute little girl with sociopathic tendencies, but after 150 chapters, it feels like she's barely changed: >!she's an unimaginable monster, and her thought process is basically ooga booga!<

    >!I only keep reading for Lark and Jerltiza.!<
    ```

    - u/Unable_Discussion916:
      ```
      Vita is not charismatic, or rational, but she is still more scrupulous than an average real-life person. Real people with power consistently abuse others when it benefits them. Vita still only screws others when in lethal danger, and is otherwise quite kind. Sure, her power and circumstances make her do much more evil than your average Joe, but average Joe would have killed 10x more if put in such a situation.

  Thanks to this thread for letting me lurk and steal recs for a few years now. Checking here is part of any good Monday. I thought I'd contribute some. Here are some things I've read (either in entirety, or the most recent updates for) in the last week or two. For clarity, these aren't pressing recommendations so much as they are hastily written reviews after going through my browser history:
  Dropped < OK < Good < Great < Awesome

  &nbsp;

  [Paranoid Mage](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/49879/paranoid-mage) - Original Work (Great):

  Features a middle-aged man suddenly being thrust into a life on the run as he discovers the modern world is covered in magical creatures and an overly authoritarian mage guild. Urban fantasy, but most of the time has been spent exploring cool powers while on the run from the Magical Feds. Other than [Ar'Kendrithyst](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26727/arkendrithyst), this is my favorite work currently updating on RoyalRoad. 

  &nbsp;

  [Sect](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/worm-xianxia-sect.989803/) - Worm / Xianxia (Awesome):

  This Ryuugi story drops Post-GM Taylor into a Xianxia world as the mind ghost of an abused girl in a poison cultivation sect. As is the usual for Ryuugi, you get 3-5 worldbuliding posts per chapter, and you can never be sure that the story will ever get updated again. However, he's generally been pretty good at mostly wrapping up major arcs before dropping a plot and vanishing for a few months. I'm always excited to see an update drop for this one. Go read it if you care for either source material.

  &nbsp;

  [Fate/Digital Shade](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/fate-digital-shade-fate-extra-fi-feat-bakasmurf.971107/) - Fate/Extra (Great):

  A Fate/Extra FI. Friend Inserts are like Self Inserts, except the author is essentially D&Ding the plot with a friend one on one, and the friend doesn't know the setting. TheOldman, LuckyChaos, Lord Trent Blackmane, and BakaSmurf are a bunch of friends who essentially all write stories starring each other in settings they don't all fully know. They're all great at it, but the stories are very hit or miss depending on how much you like the relevant settings. [Fate/Noble Shade](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/fate-noble-shade-fate-friend-insert-ft-bakasmurf-complete.538342/), the first story in this series, is one of their best, but this one is also pretty good. Would recommend both. I ended up skipping the middle installment myself though - got bored.

  &nbsp;

  [Neverending Cycle](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/neverending-cycle-entity-si-multicross.97300/) - Worm (OK):

  SI Popcorn fic where the insert controls a weak, pre-cycle worm entity, with Earth Bet nowhere in sight. The general plot follows the SI as it goes through the universe, training shards into more useful powers via cycles. Two cycles have completed so far - one on a planet with essentially no life, and one on a planet where the only life was tribal. I'm concerned that this formula doesn't really work well enough to keep reader interest beyond the dual factors of 'Oh, this is novel' and 'Ha, he can pretend to be a god'.

  [Tome of the Orange Sky](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/tome-of-the-orange-sky-naruto-mgln.102295/) - Naruto / Nanoha (OK):

  If you haven't read anything by CmptrWz, he basically takes dark settings, changes background details to make them less dark, hands the protagonist enough out of context power to break the setting, and then slowly turns the plot into slice-of-life with occasional battle scenes from those enemies that still exist in the setting. I can happily turn my brain off and watch the newly overpowered main character break the setting over a hundred thousand words or so of power ramping. Unfortunately, in the past, his characters from book to book have felt mostly the same, but at least the exact powerset of the protagonist changes enough between stories to keep things fresh. I've followed this one, but I'll probably end up dropping it in a few months once the setting has been tamed and I get tired of reading what Naruto & gang are doing this Wednesday. Overall, I'm glad he's writing this, but can't get very excited over it.

  Read this one last night. It's a decently well written fantasy kingdom builder with some warring. It's just finished the second arc, and I'm uncertain if the author is up to making the jump from planetary kingdom building to space. I'm not sure I'll check in on it again, but we'll see.

  [Breathing In](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13109509/1/Breathing-In) - Naruto (Great):

  It's a Naruto OC/SI, but set a decade or so before canon, and is a slow burn. Focuses on character connections and wartime struggles more than general shonen plotlines. Dodges a lot of the more poorly written tropes, and the writing is technically sound. If you aren't completely burned out on the setting, I'd give it a shot. I liked it enough to follow so I could read further chapters as they come out.

  I don't know what it is about AO3, but (once you filter out all the porn) it seems like the site mostly loves angst. This was recced on one of these threads I think. I'm not sure why I read the whole thing, but found it too depressing for my tastes, slowly spiraling into worse and worse situations, but somehow without getting past the point of "too dark to care, it starts seeming silly". I don't expect the author to ever pull up and make things better, though. I blame thriller mechanics keeping me turning the page for why I caught up on this.

  [Project: Gamer Ver 2](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/project-gamer-ver-2-young-justice-gamer-oc.92217/) - Young Justice / Splashes of other settings (Great):

  The best actively-updating Gamer fic I know of, the story manages to dodge all the problems most Gamer stories have. Instead of being a shonen loop of grinding + free powers = power fantasy, this story retains my interest by focusing mostly on character interactions and inane interactions between the DC universe and common game abilities. The main character isn't a pacifist, but loves ending combats by baleful polymorphing his enemies into frogs. Not perfect by any means, but good enough I've been enjoying every update that's been coming out. Would recommend.

  [Edge Cases](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/52639/edge-cases) - Original LitRPG (Good):

  An Adventure story that focuses on how silly LitRPG mechanics are in real life. Tickles the part of me that loves poorly written tabletop rules and that one player who says "well, rules as written..." Not enough chapters to make me feel secure, but most of what's here is interesting. The last few chapters have been uninteresting backstory - hopefully we can get back to the entertainment of actions like blocking metaphysical attacks with a shield because someone has the ability to spend health "succeed at a blocking an attack they would otherwise fail to".

  That should be enough for now.

    > Project: Gamer Ver 2

    I enjoyed reading this story, but I do feel the need to point out its foreword ends up being very hypocritical:

    >We've all seen gamer stories. The main character hops in, instantly gets his super powered epic skill and a harem of hotties. Goes on to hop into the main plot and become the best of friends with everyone important and everything ends up going their way.
    >Unfortunately, Leslie doesn't want to be here. And all of that sounds like way too much work.

    I honestly took this to imply he was going to "take Roy off the grid" a la Rick and Morty... That's not really what happens. The main character hops in, teases us with some adult horror, then gets a super powered epic skill. The story even teeters on the edge of him getting a "hottie" (a 13 year old girl he turned into a frog) in the first couple chapters even if it ultimately doesn't go that direction. The protagonist is sarcastic and kind of a jerk, but that's not exactly anathema to most Gamer stories with or without Gamer's Mind.

    Beyond that, he still falls in with the heroes, get added to the YJ teen team roster and uses his ridiculously overpowered kit to run roughshod over anyone who gets in his way, all the while playing tricks on villains and unironically memeing with memes that don't exist in that reality. There's even >!a second Gamer character with a standard bruiser build that the protagonist completely outclasses with 0 effort using his non-standard caster build!<

    Considering the opening, I'm guessing it's at least partly inspired by The Paragamer, which has the same sort of American teen grunge tone/setting at the start, though that story does more with it before moving on and losing that charm. This one is not nearly as consistent in its tone or themes, and abandons the street level very quickly.

    Overall, it's good popcorn and you'll get a bit of extra enjoyment if you know the references. It's disappointing to get teased with deconstruction and only get another rehash half-fix-fic, though.

        Yeah. Having read a bit further, the Gary Stu starts creeping in pretty quickly once the characters are established, and you get gems like Batman himself explaining away the MC's social gaffes to the teens, while the MC is psychopathically sniping zombies from a rooftop in the background.

        On the Black Canary front, I'm not sure we fully agree. Frankly, the YJ adults are very poorly translated in fanfic and this is just another example of it. People turn them into a weird amalgam of every DC version of the character without taking into account that the YJ versions are specifically set up to be "the old guard" in almost exclusively mentor roles. I guess it's runoff from the MCs being more "adult" themselves, but in that case why not set them up as a mentor instead?

        I do agree that the author loves portraying his character as "an impossible enigma, who is nonetheless honest with anyone who asks questions directly". Having Black Canary as "the counselor" is what lands her in that weird role. We're told she doesn't understand him and he's causing her headaches, but it's never shown. (she then gets replaced by a nobody who's also never shown). It's kind of obnoxious.

        This. Batman at least gets some point of view snippets that respect his intellect somewhat.
         The fic dumps on the Canary very hard, and very consistently. To the point where it feels like the author is working out issues.

        More generally, why, oh why would you make a cross with young justice, and have an anti-social MC? It is one of the most iconic ensembles in all of comics. You need to goddamn interact with them!

  I'm looking for stories where the protagonist only has a short time left to live, whether it is because of disease or injury or old age or curses. However, the story **must not** be about romance/family/friendship, because I have already seen countless stories like those, where the dying protagonist finds love or spends time with loved ones before the end.

  I want to see other takes on the premise. Like maybe a very old lady has fight demon king, and has to go around swinging a sword despite having arthritis. Or maybe Dumbledore has to hurriedly set all the plans in motion to defeat Voldemort after his own death. Or a terminally ill patient with brain cancer is the only one immune to the mass mind control device of an evil villain organization, and has to free the world from their clutches.

    My story, [Conquest of Avalon](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/42560/conquest-of-avalon), involves one main character ending up with a drastically reduced lifespan at the end of the first book, which greatly informs their drive to accomplish their goals and informs their mindset. I can pm you spoilers if you don't care, too.
    ```

    - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
      ```
      I'm very wary of stories where the main characters can trade their lifespans for power, because I've seen many many stories like that where the lifespan trading seems to have no effect whatsoever. The protagonists are always full of confidence that they will be able to get their lifespans back or do whatever they need to do, or are cultivators with such ridiculously long lifespans anyway that cutting their 10000 year lifespan by 99% only brings them back to ordinary levels anyway. The way they behave ends up being pretty much exactly the same as any other protagonist of the same genre. 

      They show zero tension, fear, anxiety, or resignation regarding their reduced lifespans, and make absolutely no post-humous plans whatsoever despite the fact that their death is supposedly imminent. From a cynical point of view, the lifespan sacrifice only exists so that the author can show that their main character is capable of and willing to make great self-sacrifices, but without actually making their main character weaker in any way whatsoever.

      So when you say drastically reduced lifespan, how likely is it that the main character will actually run out of lifespan before they accomplish their goals? Are they more likely to die in battle from non-lifespan-related reasons than from lifespan termination? Is running out of lifespan probable enough that they are actually planning countermeasures in the event of their own death? Do they display an urgency to achieve something with their remaining lifespan, an urgency that truly surpasses the urgency that any healthy young main character would already normally feel about achieving their goals?
      ```

      - u/Husr:
        ```
        The story is far from a cultivation power fantasy, but I'll admit it might not be exactly what you're looking for here either. The character's death is young, and loses half of what remains to remains to them, which in practice means that their death isn't particularly imminent. 

        However, their goals are of such geopolitical scale that it poses a genuine problem, and a genuine change in outlook: greater urgency, greater recklessness, more willingness to alienate peers to pursue the goal, more capacity for deceipt for the same reason. It definitely surpasses prior urgency, given that the goals haven't changed but the approach drastically has. 

        Still, it doesn't sound like a perfect fit, so no problem if you're not interested.

    I'm actually going to recommend you the exact opposite of what you asked for here, [Sousou No Frieren](https://mangadex.org/title/b0b721ff-c388-4486-aa0f-c2b0bb321512), a manga about the Elf Mage of a typical adventurer hero party that had slain the demon king living her life, well after everyone that had been important to her as already died out years ago while she has hardly aged at all, and tagging along with some other characters as they go to slay the new Big Bad while she's just going in the same direction anyway.

    So in a sense, it's about everyone other than the main character having only a short time left to live and doing what they can with their life, and the protagonist still fully aware of the imperanence of existence as a result. While the main character is notably muted from her experiences and centuries of living, but the melancholy of the situation and story still comes across perfectly well.

    That said, if you were looking for a short-lived protagonist frantically scrambling throug the Plot because of the desparation and drive of having nothing to lose by failing since your death is already a guarantee, this is not what you're looking for, but I thought to mention it since it's still a different take of the core idea of the protagonist's lifespan and worldview from this being vastly different from those around them.

  Okay I've started reading Artemis, the second Andy Weir book. I'm like 2 or 3 chapters in and already I am thinking...

  WHY DON'T PEOPLE LOVE IT? 

  Like, there's many tiers of novel for me, there's S tier which are things I can't put down, The Martian and Project Hail Mary are both in there along with Speaker for the Dead, The Handmaid's Tale, and Luminosity. 

  But then there's A tier which I love but I can put down and am happy to read a chapter here or there and genuinely enjoy/look forward to but not to an "addictive" extent. Like Dragon's Egg or Ender's Game or The Testaments. 

  Artemis isn't S tier like Weir's other books, but it's A tier. I don't get why it doesn't get more love.

  I expected to hate the protagonist but I love her, I really relate to her, she definitely suffers a bit from "female protagonist written by a man" syndrome but when I heard that the character wasn't written well I was expecting much worse. She is just like, a lot like me, a lot like the way I see myself (egotistical intelligent underacheiver/etc), and I just.... I don't know why people don't like it. The worldbuilding is fun and awesome. 

  I've only barely started the book but I want to recommend it. I want to acknowledge it's not S-tier like Weir's two other books but it's A-tier and I recommend A-tier books all the time.
  ```

  - u/self_made_human:
    ```
    I didn't like Artemis, to the point I gave up a quarter of the way through.

    Even The Martian felt considerably overhyped to me.

    However, this version that was written as a realistic take on how The Martian would look like [if Starship was used](https://caseyhandmer.wordpress.com/2021/04/09/the-martian-starship/) is certainly hilarious! And a great illustration of how much has changed in a mere decade or so.
    ```

  - u/Dragongeek:
    ```
    First, I liked Artemis too. It was a fun read.

    That said, the two main criticisms I have are:

    Formulaic: This becomes more obvious when including *Project Hail Mary*, but it's obvious that Weir has found a recipe that he likes to write and people like to read. Doesn't exactly make the story "bad" per-se, but it does make it predictable. 

    The Protagonist: It's clear that Weir went out of his comfort zone when writing Artemis. Instead of a middle-aged white science man protagonist, he jumped straight to writing a female Islamic young adult who grew up on the freaking moon. The humor is similar and maybe the character's penchant for science-ing out problems, but otherwise you couldn't pick more different people. There's also a much heavier focus on character interaction and interpersonal relationships which are almost non-existent in The Martian or PHM. He does it well, but stumbles a bit on the landing. Also, the assholeishness of the protagonist is a bit of a turn off.
    ```

  - u/DanielMBensen:
    ```
    I'm like you. I liked Artemis a lot. Not as much as Weir's other two books, but still more than most other contemporary SF. I could tell he was stretching himself as a writer. I respect that.
    ```

  - u/larrylombardo:
    ```
    I thought Artemis was neat but hokey, which is how I felt about Weir's other works. I've read a lot of "hard scifi in space", and while I enjoyed his nods and setups, he writes like he wants everything to become a movie. Likeable but non-contentious characters, problematic protagonist saving the day (through Science!), a lot of exposition and scene writing - it just felt a bit formulaic the second and third times around.
    ```

  I read [Crescat](https://sprague-grundy.github.io/crescat/) the other day and highly recommend it. It's a kind of fantasy alternate-history magic school pastiche. The MC Rose gets sent off to magic school with a group of strange characters. To get to the school, they have to make their way through a labyrinth while solving riddles. The story is written so that each chapter centers on a specific riddle, which readers are implicitly encouraged to solve on their own.  
  The story in Crescat is interesting on its own, and the riddles are pretty fun and seem like a good fit for this sub. The last chapter was posted in October, so it might be abandoned. Totally worth reading what exists, though.  
  I really like this riddles-in-a-story style. It reminded me a lot of [The Man Who Counted](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1160800.The_Man_Who_Counted), by Malba Tahan. I started re-reading that after finished Crescat. It's a bit less logic puzzle and more mathematical puzzle than Crescat, but still pretty fun.  
  Anyone have suggestions for more works that mix riddles and story like this?

It's basically about a society whose economy and military power is centered around a corporation(think East India Company) harvesting blood from dragons in a far off continent.
