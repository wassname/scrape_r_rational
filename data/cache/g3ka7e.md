## Oh my god, Animorphs: The Reckoning is SO good.

### Post:

SUCH an amazing story. Completely captured my attention since the first chapter and now I can't stop reading. I guess I'm the last one on this subreddit to discover it, but if you haven't read it yet - you really should.

After running out of Worth The Candle I really missed having something awesome to read, and Animorphs definitely fills that void.

Ridiculously fast-paced, amazingly well-written. So many clever twists and ideas. Everything I want out of rational fiction.

At first I was worried that I'd need some familiarity with the original story, but nope, I didn't know anything about Animorphs before reading this and it was fine.

So yeah, if you've seen this story getting lots of upvotes here but wasn't sure whether or not to read it - just go for it, it's awesome, it goes into high gear from the first chapter and never stops.

  I'm on the more desperate-for-feedback end of writers, so this absolutely made my day to wake up to.  I'm super glad that you've enjoyed the story, and hope you like the next chapter (which should be out in 1-3 weeks).

    I sent you a dm 3 years ago asking for updates to the story, and you've managed to hold my interest for all that time. There are not many things that have achieved the same, I usually move on with my interests pretty quickly if they don't manage to snatch me quickly, so well done. 

    I wonder how much of it is nostalgia. I never did manage to read the original series (mostly because I wasn't proficient with English when I read them and only the first twenty books were translated to Finnish), but the stuff you write is far more interesting to me at this point in any case. I'll make sure to give a little more feedback in the future if it's something you like receiving!

  Second all this, in case anyone's still on the fence and needs more reinforcement. 

  I'm legitimately not trying to humble-brag or engaging in Imposter Syndrome or anything, I'm proud of my work and don't mind talking it up when appropriate,  but I actually get sad that Reckoning gets less upvotes than my story. The likely culprit is that Animorphs is less popular than Pokemon, but unfamiliarity really shouldn't stop anyone from at least checking it out. 

  Even if I imagine it being only 70% as enjoyable without familiarity with canon, that still puts it head and shoulders above most fiction I've read, and I don't think it lowers the value of how much *simply good writing* and *effectively communicated rationality* there is in it. The author literally was in charge of teaching hundreds of people applied rationality for *years,* if you care at all about getting more out of fiction than just a good story then it's seriously a must-read.

  - u/DaveTheDalek:
    ```
    Seeing that A:tR doesn't require any canon knowledge is pushing me to read it now. I've seen good reviews about your story, but I haven't read it as I have absolutely zero Pokemon knowledge. Would you say your story requires any sort of canon knowledge, or can I jump in without knowing anything beforehand?
    ```

    - u/ConnorF42:
      ```
      I have minimal Pokemon knowledge, played the first game and watched a bit of the show when it came on TV at the kid. The story is completely understandable and enjoyable so far, but it is kinda annoying to have to look up what every Pokemon looks like when they come up for first time, as I am only familiar with Gen1. I downloaded a pokedex app on my phone for it.
      ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      It's mostly just that you miss out on jokes/references/cool explanations for things from the original canon.  For example, there's a really funny line like "what, are the bad guys gonna just put giant R's on their chests??" that would be much less funny if you hadn't seen team rocket in the OG stuff 

      The story itself will still make basically complete sense
      ```

    - u/DaystarEld:
      ```
      u/ConnorF42 covered it I'd say, I've been told from others who aren't familiar with pokemon that they still enjoyed it and got good stuff out of it.

      You'll miss some inside jokes and be less able to appreciate some changes to the world, but the only really annoying part will be the lack of mental image that comes from a pokemon being named, since I spend minimal time describing them (there are just so many it bogged down the writing when I tried it early one).
      ```

  - u/Xtraordinaire:

    > The likely culprit is that Animorphs is less popular than Pokemon

    Can confirm, total unfamiliarity with the source material was a factor in my case.
    ```

  - u/xachariah:
    ```
    Alright, you convinced me to give it a go.  Mostly I've kept away because I'm not an animorphs fan, animorphs isn't a cool power, and a general dislike of 'furry stuff'.  

    But you got me.  I'll read some chapters and post back.

    Edit: It seems to be written pretty well.  I'm not sure if I'll hang on long term though, since I'm not that interested in the setting.

      > animorphs isn't a cool power

      You don't think it would be cool to be able to turn into a gorilla and open an impossible-to-open mason jar? Or to turn into other people or aliens, and experience life from their perspective? (In the original books, turning into other people was usually against their ethical code, but they were 100% able to do it.)

        Of...of all the things you could do with a gorilla morph...*that's* what you're going with??

    - u/redrach:
      ```
      >Â a general dislike of 'furry stuff'

      I share your dislike of that aesthetic, but Animorphs never triggered that same dislike in me. I think it comes down to the fact that the characters don't "identify" with their morphs in any way (in fact a lot of the times the changes are downright traumatic) and rather use them as tools to fight the alien invasion. 

      The closest you can get is with one of them who gets permanently stuck in a certain form in canon, but this is again treated as something terrible that they have to learn to live with rather than some transcendent experience.
      ```

  - u/winteredDog:
    ```
    How did you find the story? Do you think more people just search for pokemon fanfiction over animorph fanfiction and that causes the upvote/follower discrepancy?
    ```

    - u/DaystarEld:
      ```
      Well in the context of finding it through this sub, which is how I did, I also meant that more people who see it when a new chapter appears or on a list of rational fiction are likely to be familiar with pokemon and curious or passionate about it, rather than animorphs, which were popular for YA novels but not, like, "the most popular piece of media in the world" popular like Pokemon.

    I started reading Pokemon:OOS this week, based solely on learning that it's written by someone who appreciates /u/TK17Studios work as much as I do.

    So far I like it!
    ```

- u/minekasetsu:
  ```
  You know, I watched [a lecture on animorph](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zrE6m3xOoE) recently, and the original already have some heady stuffs and I'm not sure they are super irrational or anything, so now I wonder what are the changes in this one?
  ```

  - u/zorianteron:
    ```
    I watched that lecture, too, and I've read about 10 chapters.

    Things seem to move quicker than they did in the books, there's a lot of discussion about details of the mechanics of the setting/more munchkinning than is mentioned in the books, visser 3 is smarter, and the whole thing is more 'mature' in the sense that it's not written for kids (I presume the language in the original books is a lot simpler)- the characters imply a lot of things with few words in a way I'd doubt would show up in a kid's book.  It's actually slightly unlikely to hear (13 year old?) kids speak this way- not impossible, just seems unlikely that a whole group of kids would be this smart- but it works for me.

    It seems darker than the original, too.
    ```

    - u/Fiazba:
      ```
      Darker than the original? Damn. That takes some effort given the source material.
      ```

      - u/zorianteron:
        ```
        It goes into the logical ramifications of morphing in a pretty satisfying (i.e. horrifying) way.  There are some changes to exactly how it works as well- these are alluded to in the first chapter, so it doesn't feel like a cop-out.
        ```

        - u/Fiazba:
          ```
          I'm 15 chapters in now. You were right. This is as horrific or possibly more horrific than the original series. Well done, author.

              Hello, I just got caught up in r!Animorphs and I wanted to tell you that I loved it! It was delightful from start to finish. Lots of cool ideas, lots of fun references to pop culture or science fiction, and lots of nostalgic memories. When the first name of the DHS guy's son was revealed, I gasped out loud. It's been years since I read an Animorphs book, but the instant I read his name, it felt like a punch in the gut and his whole story came flooding back. Thank you so much for giving such a complex series the care it deserves.

                That was *exactly* what I was hoping for.

                Next chapter still slated for 1-2 weeks from now!
                ```

    ```
    The author (/u/TK17Studios) has put a ton of effort into making all the disparate parts of the Animorphs universe more cohesive. The original series spends at least half of its run being a monster-of-the-week serial, and this results in a lot of one-off developments and plots that *almost* work but are then dropped, never to be touched again. TK17 takes all those threads (well, the good ones) and neatly ties them all together.  

    If you're familiar with the Ultimate Marvel comics, the same treatment has basically been done to the backstory. Where originally all the various super heroes are basically make-it-up-as-we-go-along, in Ultimate Marvel many of the heroes are the result of people trying to recreate Captain America's super soldier serum: Hulk happens because Banner thinks he can boost the incomplete formula with gamma rays; Spider-Man and Green Goblin happens because Norman Osborne is trying tons of things to nab the same military funding, etc. It's a relatively small change to the universe, yet it takes a lot of unrelated parts and ties them all together beautifully. Animorphs: The Reckoning does this but better. 

    That alone makes the world more *rational*, but it's the treatment of the characters that makes the whole thing meet the higher bar of *rationalist*. The kids are all turned up to 11, and each of them has a handle on some aspect of intelligence that gives them a means to contribute without feeling same-y and while also preserving their original voice and characterization. And then of course since they've been given a lightsaber...Visser Three has been transformed from Saturday-morning-cartoon villain into a true mastermind.

    Care has also been taken to alter the various alien species to be more, well *alien*. KA Applegate did a good job of inventing cool alien ideas, but for the most part is hampered by the standard sci-fi "everyone speaks English and is basically a human in a rubber suit when it comes down to it". TK17 fixes this by giving each species vastly different values from our own, and in some cases alters even the way they think, to challenge what it means for a thought or value to be universal.

    As someone who maintains a tier list of the original books and who regularly reads through them all every few years...there's not really any aspect that the originals do *better*. The Reckoning makes em look like the first draft for this story.

    11/10 could not recommend higher.

      Sooo I'd be interested in that Animorphs book tier list sometime.
      ```

  - u/360Saturn:
    ```
    Everyone's intelligence is up, certain characters' ruthlessness is up, and the motives of the villains are more complicated than 'take over the world just because'.

    Also the limits of their morphing powers are more clearly defined and optimized. I won't say any more as that will ruin it!

- u/Asviloka:
  ```
  As someone else with no familiarity with canon, I firmly second this recommendation. It reads very well fandom-blind.

- u/DuplexFields:
  ```
  Neat! Is it original to FFN only, or is it being written as a serial on SpaceBattles or another site?

  Also:

  A Yeerk, a Goa'uld, and a Trill walk into a bar...

  - u/FenrirW0lf:
    ```
    It gets posted to both AO3 and FFN. AO3 handles formatting better so it's prolly better to read it there.

      Needs more punch. I tried this punchline with my dad, and he had to repeat the joke and ask me what I meant before he got it. For reference, weâve watched all the Star Treks and Stargates together since my youth.

  So anyone thinking about reading it, I'd suggest not looking up any information on animorphs. The setting is just so dumb and 2000's that I don't enjoy visualizing it at all, much better to go in blind. For example >!there are a race of robot dogs that fly around in space ships that look like puppies and the main aliens themselves look like they're from a 13 year olds deviantart !<

  - u/TK17Studios:
    ```
    Author here.

    My org decided to move some of its planned research retreats up to now instead of later due to the coronavirus crisis, so the time I would have spent writing in Feb and March was instead spent running around doing tons of ops and logistics and support and research and stuff, and then I was burned out and wrote [a bunch of essays from anonymous prompts](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TTpxkN4svJePRPGtvg9rI8OAZpYS1FFb5yIiYVz3ZbM/edit?usp=sharing) instead of writing r!Animorphs.

    But I've just this past two days been working on the next chapter, and I expect it to go up in 1-3 weeks with at least four or five updates following fairly regularly before I have to take another break.
    ```

  - u/MagicWeasel:
    ```
    Added to the author's own response, it regularly takes a hiatus of ~6 months and then has 3-4 chapters published at once. Worth the wait.
    ```

    - u/TK17Studios:
      ```
      Hey, hey, at least *sometimes* I get out like six or seven chapters and then take a *three* month hiatus.  =P

      We're in the endgame now so I don't foresee any more than one more hiatus before it's all done.  We have fewer than 15 chapters to go.

        Please tell me beautiful lies instead of harsh truths :( I want it forever.

        I have fond memories of re-reading it during my honeymoon in February 2016. It'll be sad to lose such a constant in my life. 

        But I'm sure whatever you have planned will be worth the loss of regular  updates!

  I tried it a while ago... I stopped reading early on when the female character does something incredibly stupid. Like, reveals their group's existence to the evil aliens, or something.
  ```

  - u/FenrirW0lf:
    ```
    I'm surprised that was enough to turn you away, as the consequences of that reckless move hit the group hard and fast. imo bad impulsive decisions from a character aren't necessarily a narrative blight unless they're rewarded for them, which they very much aren't in this case.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      You're completely right. However, when a main character does something *that* dumb it makes me lose empathy for them. I just... stop caring about them, and by extension about the story.

      That said, I'd probably be able to get past this if I tried reading it again.

        ```
        In part, this was because the canon Rachel would not have lasted within the rationalist Animorphs universe; I needed her to make a very bad mistake and learn the lesson very, very hard, as early as possible, sort of leapfrogging over what was 20 or 30 books of character development in the original series.

        There are not a lot of other mistakes like that.
        ```

        - u/cae_jones:
          ```
          When you put it like that, I'm reminded specifically of that book with The Inspector. It's more interesting to see that chapter as abridging that one with Book 2.

          Also, not remembering if you've mentioned it or not, but somehow I doubt The Inspector is appearing in this fic. Though I find his biology and character less perplexing than the confusing implications about the Yeerk hierarchy. Also being a monster of the week that was never mentioned before or after. Did someone give a disabled Andalite coffee, and decided it would be funny to offer their Yeerk a seat on the Counsil if they could keep it up for a week?
