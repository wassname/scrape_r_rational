## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding and Writing Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*
* Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is *also* the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday Recommendation thead)

  A couple of days ago, I finished writing the first draft of a novel...

  ... What do you think I should do with it?


  I already plan on the standard 'take some time off, then revisit the draft with fresh eyes' to improve it; but once I've made the best draft I can, what next? Post it to my personal site, or to free writing gallery sites like RoyalRoad, or look into epublishing, or...? (I don't expect I'm going to make a single dime from this story; at best, it might provide some advertising for things I write in the future.)

  (In case it makes a difference, it's [HSF][TH] with one background detail that's somewhere around One Small Fib on the [Hardness Scale](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MohsScaleOfScienceFictionHardness), depending on how out-there you consider a particular physics theory to be.)

    Depends what you want out of it. If you just want as many people reading your work as possible, royal road. If you want some chance of making money, try to submit to traditional publishers or just go the amazon kindle unlimited route (get some guidance of what it takes to self promote on amazon). If you want it to serve as advertisement, hold onto the book until you have another one ready, post it for free but put the other one up for sale.

    You could post it on forums like Sufficient Velocity or Space Battles as well, SV has User Fiction while SB has Creative Writing you can post on. I'd say do it.

    My first question would be how are you going to define these 'types' of material that can be used? Will people be able to control specific molecular structures, like H20, or only elements, like hydrogen and oxygen? If the latter, would someone with control over hydrogen/oxygen still be able to move water?

    The power side of this seems to not only get you raw strength but also the heating and cooling and therefore the ability to change the matter's state. So what does the precision side have going for it? Atomically sharp projectiles? Generating sound?

    Which brings me to a similar magic system I was thinking about not too long ago. Eventually, I started thinking that most of the "elements" could probably replicate interesting exploits from other elements. For example, if you can control small particles of 'earth' or water/liquid in the air with enough precision, could you technically oscillate them to make sounds (something I originally thought would be specific to wind/gas elementalists)?

        Interesting, so can a solid bender use all solid material but only so long as it's a solid? If not, how are different state benders differentiated?

        I suppose you could have it so that, for example, a liquid bender can only stick their magic into matter that is currently in a liquid state, but once the magic is in the matter they can change its state and maintain control of it. 

        Also, what sort of range and sensory control do these magic users have? On the latter subject, could a gas user controlling all the air in a room feel how it's displaced by objects/people? If this is the case then all benders with enough precision should essentially have a sixth sense from filling the air with small particulates.
