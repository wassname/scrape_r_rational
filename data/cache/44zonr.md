  This is the best thing I have read this week, Rob is awesome, there's not much else to say.

    Thank you! I've been having a lot of fun with him. 

    One thing I've gotten some comments about is the fact that his speech level keeps changing. I made an effort to clarify that this chapter; did it come clear?

      It was very clear, actually I didn't notice until it was pointed out and when it was I felt it was a really neat detail.

  The story continues and we get to see Rob be cool.

  It's 404 on Dropbox?

  "Full" link is fine.

    Thank you; fixed.

    Hazards of posting while in the middle of a 9-hour bus ride.  Sorry for the glitch.

      Not completely fixed. Chapter cuts off after about 600 words.

  Wow. Rob is smart. *Really* smart. Maybe even *too* smart, to be honest to him. He's, what, ten or twenty times the mass of any other robot on the field? Every single one of the opponents was disabled by pathological environmental obstacles placed by his throws. I'd be hard pressed to do that myself, even if I were strong enough to do it. It's very surprising that not even one of his targets was killed just by being hit by being hit by something heavy moving fast. Maybe Rob's intellectual bent is showing through? "I refuse to dirty my hands with something as crude as a thrown rock. My methods will be more refined. Unless it's that guy's mech. *That* I'm going to beat to death with my bare feet." :P

  That said, I doubt anybody's going to come up with that suspicion. That'd be so far outside their hypothesis space that it's not even funny.

  Good story. :D

    Well, he did drop a heavy sheet of metal on top of Yanno's mech.  He was trying not to specifically take out any of the mechs with direct strikes, because then it would be clear in people's minds that he had deliberately attacked.  This was all just him being clumsy, right?  The fact that he caused the destruction of every other mech on the field (aside from the hopper)...well, that's just luck, right?  Much like a Jackie Chan battle.
    ```

    - u/Vebeltast:

      Maybe I'm imagining him throwing much more, and much heavier, rubble around than he actually is, then. My thought was that he was throwing enough around that I'd expect at least one direct hit, and the lack thereof would be evidence toward him actively aiming *away* from his opponents.

      And, yes, I agree that "That's just luck, right?" is a pretty reasonable conclusion for the onlookers right now. I'd give the grad students the least bad chance, and then only if they start getting suspicious for other reasons.

        It wasn't as heavy as you'd think; his lifting arm is stronger than a human, but not by a lot.  His mid arm is about average human strength, and his fine arm is quite weak but very dextrous.

        Not that much, no.  Probably ~10-12 pieces total.

  This all reads great and has a nice plot to go, the downsides I see so far are:


  1.Lack of sufficient emotional response by protag.

  2. Illogical plan by agents of murder.

  3. Survival plan is going a little too easy, the dinner job was pure luck.

  This all indicates either some plan by forces that be for protag, or your choice to skip the rebound parts and go on to plot and powerup. 
  Or something else entirely. Or just accident. Or I am reading too much into this. 

  Rob is great, character definition and behavior is also great, but character descriptions are bit weak, how does Jess look like, how does Rob look like? 3 legs? 3 arms? humanoid build, tall, short, stocky, caricature-ish? 

  Its possible I overlooked descriptions, so pls forgive. Feel free to repeat character appearance, in context to actions or similar though.
