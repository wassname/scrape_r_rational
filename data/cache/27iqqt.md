  As others have said, all the characters are OOC. The writing is not that good and spelling, grammar, and tense issues are common. The story content seems somewhat interesting so far, though, so it's worth a look if you like Evangelion.

  The Ikari conjecture was the first thing I thought of when I read the AT field description and purpose, this story takes it to a natural conclusion. Yay story. Philosophy is a bit pushy , so far reading 5 chapters. Everybody is OOC a little bit, no explanation so far. Will keep reading on
