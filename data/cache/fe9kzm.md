  Ominous mention at the start: check. Mysterious puppeteering behind the revelations and coincidences that are causing a Named-heavy story to happen: check.

  **BARD ALERT.**

  ```
  Im loving this murder mystery arc.

  - u/WalterTFD:
    ```
    It's like, the opposite of a murder mystery.  We know who was killed, and who killed him, and why they did it, and where and when.
    ```

    - u/GrecklePrime:
      ```
      You are correct. My habit of reading these right after I wake up apparently makes it harder to understand the chapters. Whoops.

- u/GreenGriffin8:
  ```
  Is this the last book?
  ```

  - u/RiggSesamekesh:
    ```
    Yes. The author has said that they planned for five to be the last, though, so it's possible the story runs away from them again.
