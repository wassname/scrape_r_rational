  One standout review from Royal Road, with credit to Giles who posted it:

  > Revanche. Revenge.
  > 
  > The Kingdom of Avalon swept across the Empire of the Fox a generation past, conquering the heartlands and leaving the broken remnants to stew in the island duchy of Guerron.
  > 
  > This isn't a story of Good versus Evil, of kindly kings doing their best to lift all subjects, or of unvsr ished heroes doing battle against evil. 
  > 
  > Instead, this story is about power: who has it, who wants it, and what people will do to obtain it. It is about the violence inherent in the imperial project and how even the most well-intentioned rulers and conquerors are, still, engaging in systemic violence against those conquered and defeated.
  > 
  > Our three point-of-view characters are a farmboy turned fire wizard, an excitable duelist with more enthusiasm than sense, and a scheming mage-priestess bent on reclaiming her family's birthright and waging war on the foreign oppressors who rule her home...no matter the cost in blood or treasure. Fernan, Florette, and Camille are each delightfully different and their stories leave you eagerly awaiting the next new chapter.

  > Come read Conquest of Avalon if you want a tight story exploring a fleshed-out workd made up of believable characters acting in realistic ways for waht they think of as the right course of action.
