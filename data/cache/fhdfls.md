  I've read through the entire story now. Sweatdrops aside, here are some of my thoughts.
  Just going to preface this by saying that these are the things i DON'T like. I love everything else, but these specific points grates me just a bit too much.

  The main focal point here is: This story is not grimdark. I keep waiting for the actual grimdark, but its just not there. What I see is a dark story taking place in an otherwise normal world. Its more realistic than grim, and dark only when its dictated by the story. If this story is going to be grimdark, it needs more grim. It needs the overhanging hopelessness, and a lot of the safety nets needs to be removed.  

  Baseline grimdark for Pokemon is [The Sun Soul](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5367085/1/The-Sun-Soul). That story shows a proper grimdark world, where everything is well, proper grim and dark. Events, world, institutions and whatnot. Really give it a read if you guys have not already.  

  The other point is more of an annoyance, but it keeps showing up too often: There are too many references jumbled in, and it breaks immersion. Be it pop culture, references to other stories, songs, catchphrases and whatever. I cant pick out any specifics from the top of my head, but theres been one too many times where I went "Wait what? Why is that in here?"

  If you compare it to the references you find in [The waves arisen](https://wertifloke.wordpress.com/2015/01/25/chapter-1/). You got references to Wu Tang Clan, an actual Panasonic TV and Monty Python thrown in there, some snide cameo remarks about other fanfictions, and even a bizzare outkast reference.
  All these references work because its something that could happen in that universe. You cant kill the Wu Tang Clan, so of course they survived and became an actual ninja clan.
  Or in good old HPMOR. The "Spoons +3" they come across in Diagon Alley. This is definitely something that could exist there.

  The references peppered in Ascension is not something that could have happened in this universe, so it makes no sense that they would be there. They need to be more in-universe or self referential, if that makes sense. They need to have a reason for existing in the first place.  

  Other than the stuff I mentioned above, this is all solid work. I can definitely see the work that has been put into the unseen world building and the characters. It would not surprise me if you guys had prewritten character sheets and studies, and some minor historic lore of the world itself.

  Im going to keep reading this to whatever conclusion it comes to, and with time I can see this catching up to both Origin of Species and The game of Champions in terms of quality. So keep at it, you can go far with this fic.

    ```
    The grimmdark/horror tags were meant to warn the readers of dark themes. For example, the events in ch 14, and in the new act have several horror elements, and readers were glad to be warned. If you think there is a better/more suitable tag to express this feel free to suggest it In other words, what tag would you use for - Dark story in a realistic world. We do want to give some warning as a courtesy for readers, so they may avoid what they do not want to read.

    We had a few references in the early chapters, but I don't remember adding ANY cross chapter 6. It would be helpful if you gave some examples, as well as how they were confusing. We will then re-edit those chapters. We don't want to break reader immersion either. (That being said, have you felt that in recent chapters, or just in the initial few?). Further, most reference's we did use felt (at least from an authors POV) that they could legitimately exist in-universe. When we go over the chapters for another edit, we will look at them again and remove ones that are not.

    We are glad you enjoyed the story! Thank you for the review.

    \-----------------  


    I couldn't get into Sun Soul, but for different reasons.

    I kind of felt like sun souls was more about the people and less about the pokemon. Like you could take out pokemon from the story and put in some other threat and it would make no difference.

    And it also fell into the category of overly coincidential horror, which kind of hurt it for me. For example, Pallet town was fine for Ash's entire life, (over fifteen years) and the day he steps, out a gyarados destroys it. Like it was done to quickly establish a motive for him to get stronger, but I don't know... I guess when you take it to the extreme that everyone dies so commonly, death itself becomes a low-stake variable which makes it low-impact when it happens.

    I enjoyed Game of Champions a lot. I couldn't really get into Origin of Species either, but that has nothing to do with the story and entirely to do with the fact that the author chose to write it in present tense. Somehow, my brain really hurts trying to read it in that format.
