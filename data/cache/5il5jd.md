  Waiting for this to hit around 50 chapters so I can binge it.

  I just binged through it after reading the review and I gotta say I'm really, really enjoying this to the point I wish I knew the language so I could read the unstranslated version. I really appreciate the work being put into translating this!

  It's the training arc! Now with extra humor. :)
