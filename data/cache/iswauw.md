  Didn't Benjamin Franklins wife kill herself because he wouldn't stop cheating on her?

  Edit: I have heard this from multiple people, but I just looked it up and she died of a stroke.

    I appreciate that edit. Good follow through.

  This title is not a good description of the article. The article is about the "Benjamin Franklin effect" where you modify your self-perception and worldview to fit your actions, using BF as a hook to get the reader interested.
