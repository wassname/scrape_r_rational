## [D] Monday General Rationality Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics!  Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world?  Have you:

* Seen something interesting on /r/science?
* Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
* Figured out how to become immortal?
* Constructed artificial general intelligence?
* Read a neat nonfiction book?
* Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?

  PSA: Free weekly bites on cognitive tools.

  If you recall that awesome [52 tools to add to your cognitive toolkit](http://mcntyr.com/52-concepts-cognitive-toolkit/) list a while back, you may be excited to hear that Peter McInyre and Jesse Avshaomov have a new thing called [Conceptually](https://conceptually.org/).

  Conceptually sends you a new concept every week, from countersignaling to efficient markets. It looks fun!

    Thanks a bunch. I just signed up for it. I can't wait to get the first lesson and proceed to not apply it at all!!!!!! >:]

    (But seriously, at least a *few* things ought to stick).

      Yes, I would be very happy if we got more overlap between rationalist and pedagogical spaces. 

      I know there are probably useful models of learning that a pragmatically-minded person could probably exploit, which would probably also be helpful in integrating these types of tools into our lives.

      But for right now, it doesn't look like there are too many people in both (that I am aware of).

      I'll hopefully be looking into some learning / habit things this year, so maybe some basic write-ups later on can prove useful to the general crowd.

  I try to avoid having a tribal-centered mindset and avoiding the kind of reasoning that arises from it. When I notice that applause lights are switching on purely because of the labels that are involved, I try to stamp down on it. 

  I'm starting to think that it might be contributing to a sense of being adrift, or of loneliness in a general way, though, and I'm not sure how to go about dealing with that. 

  My spiritual affiliations are...odd, at the moment. Let's just say that I can't honestly claim to use certain labels in an orthodox manner and so any other uses come off as being shallow and disingenuous. I don't feel that identifying as an American really does anything to fill that "need for tribal belonging" or whatever it ought to be called, because national identities seem pretty shallow. I'm strongly opposed to 

  I *did* get a sort of "This is my place; these are my people" feeling when I was able to attend a Slate Star Codex meetup last Spring, but it's going to be a long while before I can do something like that again (best case, most of a year; worst case, years and years), and I don't know if that's actually filling that need or if it's just filling a *similar* need that I can't recognize as separate because neither has been fulfilled more than temporarily, and I'm also kind of nervous about trying to fill that hole at all. 

  Some of this has to do with rituals, I think. There are spiritual rituals which don't do anything for me because I don't perceive useful meaning behind them. I mean, there's definitely meaning, but I'd have to twist it out of the original context in order to give it a meaning that conformed to reality as I understand it, and that doesn't seem to me to be the same ritual anymore, but another ritual with surface similarities. 

  How do I fix this? Do I just deal with it, or do I find things to be super-ultra-tribal about that just don't matter, like fandoms or something like that, or what?

    There is nothing wrong in feeling tribal affiliation to the culture you were raised in, even if you don't believe in the dogma behind those labels. For example, I consider /r/rational as a sort of intellectual family, but I still occasionally surround myself with people from my home culture specifically to minimize the sense of isolation you mention. The best of both worlds sort of. Sorry if I am projecting my own interpretation on your issues. Hope you find contentment.

      Nod. The primary problem is that the tribal affiliation feels shallow/false/inauthentic if I don't subscribe to the dogma.

    Hmm, is this a similar thing as finding a group of people whose ideas / beliefs you share?

    It sounds like the rationalist-space/adjacent spheres have similar people who you'd click with (you mentioned SSC above).

    Is it more of an in-person sort of thing? It also looks like you'd like to have more meaningful rituals that you can relate to?

    Also, it sounds like you might have some tribe-related reservations?

    Apologies for not offering good answers to your query, but it looks like there are a lot of things going on, and I wouldn't want to offer suggestions without enough information.

    Well brother G that's a good set of questions.  I don't have any answer's but I can give you my 2cp on the topic (and you didn't even pay two bent pennies so consider the price):

    Tribe: (Finding your own) This is one of those journey not destination things.  It's 50/50/90(1) I'd consider you a member of my own tribe from your comments, but as you said it is easy to fall into tribal labels, and in my own opinion,  fall victim to Challenger-esque levels of group-think.  Look for people and venues where you can find people you enjoy, if you haven't found your calling/profession/ect. think about what fields are most likely to attract people you'd want to work with.  I'm currently mostly tribe-less aside from family hours away, work, and a few friends, but I have deep tribal roots to fall back on as a military veteran, so I think I empathize, but to a lesser extent, and yes fandom IMHO are a great place to send spurious tribal drives if you keep them non-obnoxious and limit there exposure to those who do not sympathize with them.  In short give your loyalty, perhaps sparingly, when you do, give it well and be willing to speak up about things that are wrong.

    Rituals: find the ones that work for you.  [Make them pay rent](http://lesswrong.com/lw/i3/making_beliefs_pay_rent_in_anticipated_experiences/) in that they are good for you. 

    Spirituality: Not much to add here.  We are all made of starstuff; a few of Heinlein's better quotes about the value, and stupidity, of humanity come to mind but that's about it.

    /end my 2 cents


    (1) Navy nuclear power saying may also be common in engineering circles to the effect: if you guess against 50/50 odds you will be wrong 90% of the time.  *Not rigorously accurate but emphasizing opportunities costs for guesses when more data can be acquired through interaction or, in the original setting getting deeper into the documentation*
