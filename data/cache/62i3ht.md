## [Challenge Companion] Weirdtopia

### Post:

**tl;dr: This is the companion thread for the biweekly challenge if you want to talk about the challenge but not necessarily participate in it. Post recommendations, thoughts, ideas, etc. below.**

[Read this thread](http://lesswrong.com/lw/xm/building_weirdtopia/) for where the concept comes from. The essential gist of it is that if you want interesting speculative fiction, you're better off going for something orthogonal to the goodness of a utopia or the badness of a dystopia. Weirdtopias tend to make for better stories for the same reasons that Good vs Evil tends to be boring.

I don't know of too many examples off the top of my head, and there's lots of room for argument. Lots of Larry Niven stories probably qualify (*The Integral Trees*, for example, takes place in a gas torus with breathable air but no planets), but they focus more on physical setting than social or technological differences. And while Iain Banks *Culture* series is utopian, there are a number of instances of other cultures which are simply weird, like the tri-gendered society structured around playing games in *Player of Games* (though that was also a dystopia).
