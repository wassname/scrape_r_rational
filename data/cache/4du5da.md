  Hey, everyone! I have been [talking](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/492l86/qd_how_to_turn_abstract_rationalist_ideas_into/) about creating a series rationality videos, and now I finally made my first few episodes!!

  I would really love to hear some feedback, so please let me know what you think =)
