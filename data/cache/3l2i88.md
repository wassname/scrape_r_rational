    I've heard Ra is great but never actually read it. What's the connection?
    ```

    - u/ArgentStonecutter:
      ```
      Read it.
      ```

        > Read it.

        Don't read it, work in Important stuff instead.

        But this does read a *lot* like it should be the first chapter of Ra.
        ```

          Prequelish, definitely.

        It never really grabbed me.

        Got as far as the giant egg thing.
        ```

        - u/Chronophilia:
          ```
          Isn't the giant egg thing from Fine Structure?
          ```

          - u/FuguofAnotherWorld:
            ```
            Maybe? Which one has the woman learning programming-magic and going into a semi-conceptual space that fills with nightmares made reality?
            ```

            - u/holomanga:
              ```
              Yeah, that's Ra.

              Though there is also an egg thing in Fine Structure. I guess Sam just likes powerful eggs.
              ```

    - u/Drazelic:
      ```
      [Climactic conflict revelation spoilers for Ra](#s "Ra is basically about a war between a vast majority of simulated humans living in a supercomputer inside the sun and a few remaining biological-human rebels who don't want the earth to be converted into computronium.")
      ```

      - u/psychothumbs:
        ```
        Oh man, to read the spoilers or not to read the spoilers. I can sort of guess the direction based on what my story is about, but am still reluctant to spoil myself. Decisions, decisions...

        Any Ra fans want to chime in on whether it's a good idea?
        ```

          /u/sam512 ended the story on a controversial, but realistic, note. It's not the most satisfactory ending, although I wouldn't call it bad. I think he mentioned burning out on fiction a bit, and it's not what I'd consider his best work.

          If you're going to read stuff on qntm, read through his short stories, or the ed stories, of fine structure.

          I'd read the spoiler, personally.
          ```

          - u/psychothumbs:
            ```
            Okay, read it. Does fit pretty exactly with my story haha.
            ```

              Especially the bit on how biologicals still resemble virtuals so much that we, the readers, view them as practically identical!

              Sam's Ra [spoilers](#s "really blurred the line between technical nanomachines and magical matrixing") that the ending comes off as unsatisfactory because it's so far from our current reality.

              I love how the biological is called an "old-timey racist" for being non-PC about virtuals. it added a nice centering point that no matter how much things change, human nature still remains the same about the Other.

              edit: whoops spoiler formatting fixed!
              ```

              - u/None:
                ```

                Is it just me, or does that sound kinda like someone missed the point of the whole "you're transhuman now, re-engineer yourself" thing?
                ```

            - u/Empiricist_or_not:
              ```
              Now read Ra.  On the plus side with that spoiler you'll want to re-read it at least one less time than if you hadn't had the spoiler.  Though t you most likely will decide to re-read it a few times anyways.
              ```
