  >...*give me your tired, your poor. Your huddled masses, yearning to breathe free. The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send them, your homeless, your tempest-tossed, to me.* And send them you do, a tide of humanity struggling toward our gates with a desperation that puts Ellis Island to shame, and we turn none back, nay, not even the meanest. Especially not the meanest.

  ...well played, Thamiel, well played.

  Man, this is a great universe to be a hippy. 

  Anyone working for The Man is literally in league with the devil, open-source software gives you superpowers, and all it takes is enough LSD to usher in a worker's paradise.

  Anyone get the blind children bit? I got the Devil Went Down To Georgia reference, of course, and for the plant-based stuff I suspect it's a horrible pun on [Seitan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat_gluten_%28food%29), but I don't get the blind children bit.
  ```

  - u/Fredlage:
    ```
    Think blind, the verb, not the adjective
    ```

  - u/ROBOT__BEE:
    ```
    Not sure about the blind children, but I think the plants might be the fruit of knowledge from Genesis.
    ```

    - u/Escapement:
      ```
      Good point. That's much more likely. The connection to the fruit of knowledge is probably the authorial intent.
      ```

      It really isn't; OP of that post [has posted in /r/unsong](https://www.reddit.com/r/unsong/comments/4j23vg/this_could_have_all_been_avoided_if_uriel_ran_his/d33qdv7).

  So...what's the sacrifice?
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Freedom

    "But the soul is still oracular; amid the market’s din,	
    List the ominous stern whisper from the Delphic cave within,—	
    ‘They enslave their children’s children who make compromise with sin."
    ```

    - u/alexeyr:
      ```
      I thought it was selling your soul.
      ```
