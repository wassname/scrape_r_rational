## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  So, a couple of days ago, my best buddy called the Kadarshev Scale "the Kardashian Scale". Now I'm sitting here regretting my life choices.

  On a more serious note, I've been binging on some mecha Anime like Gundam, Code Geass, Evangelion etc.

  Now the most glaring thing that is common in them (other than the giant mecha) is that these mechas are the strongest weapons in the arsenal of whatever military the show is focused on. But most shows never explain the why; they show the mecha in question doing feats no conventional weapons could but never why it could do them. Some handwave it away as Lost Tech of the Precursors while other completely ignore it.

  Another issue that these mechas are always piloted from within, instead of say, remotely piloted. This can be rationalized as the enemy being in possession of a device to hijack or block the signals. But both of these issues can be solved by a nested AI.

  And it makes me wonder; in what circumstances would a giant pilotable humanoid mecha be more viable in combat than literally any other type of weapon?

  I'd love to hear your thoughts on this.

    I think Evangelion justifies it pretty well. It's a bio-mechanical being that requires a human ego to operate it. Conventional weapons didn't work against the angels, so they needed something that could generate its own AT field. Considering the evas were modeled after Adam's biology (or Lilith's, I've always been confused by that), it makes sense that they were the only weapons capable of defeating the angels. 

    The dummy plug system is pretty much an AI developed to pilot the evas. The only reason they didn't use them before was because they needed to collect battle data before they could implement it. The crazy feats and flexibility of the mechs were because they were basically organic bodies held together by a metal frame. They weren't really robots, more like monsters with electronic controls attached.

      The dummy plugs aren't actually AIs, either, they're soulless human clones, IIRC.

    I have a reason for mecha to not be piloted remotely: lag. Modern drones are essentially flying artillery pieces that usually target stationary targets, but mechs are usually designed to function as infantry so they need quick reaction time. If the pilot was on the battlefield then the remote might still work, but they'd be vulnerable to interference unless the pilot was in an easily visible position, in which case they're a prime target that needs additional protection.

  I'm curious what applications you can think of for certain kinds of intelligence powers.
  Basically I'm trying to imagine all the advantages a superhuman might have if they were basically at peak human level with weak regen the standard minor hero package, and they effectively had a brain that was effectively a supercomputer, and a nervous system that operated perfectly precisely basically being replaced with fiber optics; plus some somewhat improved senses.

  _How powerful would someone be if they were basically a electronic mind that happened to be stuck in a human body but still had the speed and other advantages of being in a supercomputer?_

  I'm writing something where I'm giving the protagonist basically every intelligence ability I can other than being qualitatively smarter (because that's nearly impossible to writer). The obvious things that come to mind are being able to view things in slow motion, and being able to control one's emotions to remain totally calm in danger.

  **BONUS:** The character also has extremely weak telekinesis (able to apply force on the scale of a dozen grams) that can only be applied on surfaces he can see, with the precision being limited only by his ability to see the effect being done. This power obeys manton effects, however dead skin and hair isn't protected.    
  How much use can you have for this if you can already see the world in super slow-mo and thus see bullets travelling (even if that's way too fast to do anything with stuff other than your TK)? How much could you affect bullets by applying extremely small amounts of force very precisely?

    Instant planning, nigh-precog-like reflexes/reaction times (for both words and actions.  English follows predictable patterns, and so does physics.), being able to *accurately* fire a gun as fast as the gun can fire, and run across uneven/treacherous terrain (almost) as fast as you can run.
    ```

    - u/vakusdrake:
      ```
      >being able to accurately fire a gun as fast as the gun can fire

      That did seem to me to be one of the coolest applications of this power. _Finally a situation where having a character dual wield uzi's is plausible!_ They could calculate their firing such that each shot's recoil would shift the gun into position for the next shot, and to make themselves harder to hit they may want to be constantly diving through the air. So yeah basically your typical action hero stuff, _except rational_!

      Example of some cool real world self aiming gun tech: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBC8IFWC1P0

    > The character also has extremely weak telekinesis...

    Use it as a computer interface.  Build a low-pressure keyboard-equivalent, and you can then type much faster than the ~200 wpm that fingers are limited to (assuming that the current world record is finger-limited instead of brain-limited).
