  I'd like to quote a [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/a0i3d4/comment/eaj1q1q) from u/CouteauBleu when that chapter was posted:

  > Aaand The [Reckoning] is now forever known as "that fic where Tobias maybe has gay sex with a dolphin".
  ```

  - u/CouteauBleu:
    ```
    I know, right? I friggin called it!
    ```

  - u/philh:
    ```
    Well, "maybe" only lasted so long.
    ```

- u/Badewell:
  ```
  Erm, [Animorphs: The Reckoning](https://archiveofourown.org/works/5627803/chapters/12963046)?

  It's offscreen (and makes sense in context).

    ```
    What the fuck did I miss this??  What chapter was that mentioned in?
    ```

    - u/Badewell:
      ```
      Chapter >!35!< (and I'm not going to dig heavily for more context because if I do I will reread this story and holy shit I do not have time for that).

      But from what I remember and just skimmed, >!Tobias has been going through some shit and decides to just hang out and play with some dolphins in morph. One of the dolphins propositions him and after careful consideration Tobias decides to go for it!<
      ```

  - u/CouteauBleu:
    ```
    Reminder that whether or not Tobias went through with it is left somewhat ambiguous (but he probably totally did it).
    ```

      ```
      Rule of Ambiguity: they totally did it, but the author is pleading he fifth.
      ```

  - u/hankyusa:
    ```
    Is it complete or a work in progress?
    ```

    - u/absolute-black:
      ```
      Amazing, but not complete, and currently on a serious hiatus. The author does a lot of rationality-adjacent work and is presumably busy.
      ```

        ```
        Author posted just a few weeks ago that he was back to work on it but didn't want to start posting until he had a couple chapters finished.
        ```

    - u/Teive:
      ```
      It JUST updated again! And the author apparently has 4 more in the tank.
      ```

  ```
  I'm not sure how I should feel about immediately knowing the answer to this question.
  ```

- u/Gavinfoxx:
  ```
  ...I did not expect this question at this subreddit. Perhaps you should go ask at /r/Furry?
  ```

  - u/EmceeEsher:
    ```
    Nope, for sea creatures it's /r/Slippery
    ```

    - u/Gavinfoxx:
      ```
      Ahem. Furries use the term 'Aquatic' or 'Cetacean' for those, the sapient examples of which still qualify as 'Furry'.

      The more you know!
      ```
