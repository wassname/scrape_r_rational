## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  My last read of 2021 was 11/22/63 by Stephen King.  The premise is that a guy from 2011 is shown a portal in his friend's diner that takes him to 1958, and he decides to prevent the Kennedy assassination to prevent eg: the Vietnam war, and possibly save millions of lives.  I loved this book, minor sci-fi specifics be damned.  It isn't spectacular, but it is a great read.

  There's something about King's writing that makes his stories feel offbeat and relaxing.  Even when the stories themselves aren't something you expect to care a lot about (not that 11/22/63 is like that), he makes you feel invested in the characters.  Something I've noticed about characters in his stories that might be of interest to the people here is that they feel smarter than they should be.  They're not geniuses, but they treat the things they're doing with more intellectual care than you expect from the median person.  Further, they're often *good* people in a sense that feels real - awkward, fumbling, but well-intentioned.

  There are of course small technical details about the timestreams and stuff that aren't entirely thorough, but hell, when a writer can make you care about the characters that much, I don't think that's too relevant.

    I actually recall there being a brief Rational fanfic of this story that was posted on this site. It deconstructed the morality of the story protagonist and his mission by introducing a new rational character who talked to the protagonist about about how there were far better ways to use the time portal to assist humanity than simply stopping the Kennedy assassination. I particularly enjoyed how it criticized the myth that Kennedy was an ideal leader who would have prevented the Vietnam War if he had lived and the common American practice of treating American military causalities as the primary loss in that tragic conflict.

    PS: I just found the story. Here is a link: [https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/46iwck/rt\_executive\_action\_112263\_short/?utm\_source=amp&utm\_medium=&utm\_content=post\_body](https://amp.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/46iwck/rt_executive_action_112263_short/)

      Thanks for the link!

      Edit after reading the story: I agree that it's more morally sound, but I think it's being too uncharitable to the original (the author didn't finish the book when he wrote it, and I think that played a large part).  What he suggests in the story would probably be one of the more rational applications, but the point of the book isn't the rational exploration of utility maximization with a time portal, it's a time-travel vehicle for a story about the main character's journey.

      >I particularly enjoyed how it criticized the myth that Kennedy was an ideal leader who would have prevented the Vietnam War if he had lived and the common American practice of treating American military causalities as the primary loss in that tragic conflict.

      The positioning of this makes it seem like you're talking about the fanfic and not the book, but the book does actually talk about this.  The main character thinks about the millions of Vietnamese who would die in the conflict too, when he's making his mind up about whether it's the right thing to do.  He does more frequently think about the American soldiers who would die later in the book, but that could be chalked up to melancholy from knowing that the people he's actually talking to would die in that war.

      As for the Kennedy myth, huge spoilers:

      >!The book's ending shows what 2011 would look like if Kennedy had lived.  He didn't start the Vietnam war, that's true, but after massive conflicts in that region he loses popularity and the next president nukes Saigon to the ground.!<
      ```

      - u/BavarianBarbarian_:
        ```
        >>!The book's ending shows what 2011 would look like if Kennedy had lived.!<

        >!Eh, the book shows how it had played out if Kennedy had lived *and there was some unexplained mystical force that wants to correct and/or punish timeline interventions even though nothing like that has ever been shown in any other story set in King's expansive interconnected multiverse*!<
        ```

        - u/jozdien:
          ```
          I didn't interpret the bad things as being caused by the mystical force, just the earthquakes.  With everything else it felt like King was just saying that Kennedy living wouldn't necessarily have been a good thing.
          ```

  - u/LazarusRises:
    ```
    I was kind of shocked when I started reading King during the first lockdown--it turns out he's a *really, really good writer*. This is for sure my hipster elitism talking, but generally when anything is *that* popular--Twilight, Harry Potter, MCU, Taylor Swift--I assume it's fun popcorn at best and lowest common denominator pabulum at worst. King blew me away with compelling plots, nuanced characters, and genuinely psychologically terrifying horror hooks. I haven't read this one but I'm sure I will eventually.
    ```

- u/Whatdapan:
  ```
  So I started reading what is a new to me sub-genre of isekai - the "reincarnated as a villainess" genre - since a few popped up on royalroad within the past few months.

  I was aware of this genre's existence, but had never read one before so thought I'd give a quick review. None of them are exactly rational, but the genre is inherently about making better choices than a typical villain.

  [Tori Transmigrated](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/47030/tori-transmigrated) is the most typical of the genre and also the most popular. It features a woman reinacarnated as the villainess of a dating-sim game. I'd say it is the best written of the bunch with good characters and nice payoffs and the MC just trying to go about avoiding their fate by making sensible decisions, but still being dragged into their role as a villainess regardless. However, this also felt like it's biggest weakness as even though the MC makes sensible decisions and acts reasonably the "heroes" still end up in conflict against her no matter her actions - which can make for a frustrating read; even if this makes sense for the game-world.

  [Fated to Fall](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/47923/fated-to-fall-a-transmigrator-litrpg-tale) is probably the weakest of them - it starts with a bit of a sob story of a bullied cancer patient who dies young being reincarnated as the main villain of her favourite RPG. It's setup for her to be completely OP in time and has more LitRPG aspects. This is more of a power fantasy one, but it does have enjoyable chapters  and cute moments and I don't completely hate the MC like most LitRPGs I've read - which makes it better than most.

  [Memoirs of Your Local Small-time Villainess](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/47995/memoirs-of-your-local-small-time-villainess) is the least popular, but honestly not the worst of them. It has a sorta Game Lit system, but here the MC's personality does more of a merge with the villainess, so the MC isn't just completely overriden to be a completely different and nice, compassionate person.

  [Jackal Among Snakes](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/48969/jackal-among-snakes-gamelit-fantasy-progression) features an RPG wiki editor reincarnated as a minor early game villain. It's entertaining in the sense of seeing a character seemingly know all sorts of secrets and exploiting that advantage to the fullest, but I'm unsure of where this can go past the early arc if the MC just wins at everything.

  I'd be curious to see if anyone has any further recommendations out there in this specific sub-genre!

    I second the rec for Tori Transmigrated. It's not rational because, as you mentioned, the capture targets seem forced into conflict with the villainess to the extent that they frequently carry the idiot ball. However, it's a very satisfying popcorn read. I enjoy seeing the isekaid protagonist put her past life experience to good use.

    For other stories in the same genre:

    I've been enjoying [Villains are Destined to Die](https://tapas.io/series/villains-are-destined-to-die/info), which is a manhwa made off of a light novel.

    The premise is that a young woman gets isekaid into a romance sim's hard mode, which means playing as the villainess from normal mode. Her life is precarious because in hard mode 'failing' a single encounter usually means instant death. As she lives through the story, she discovers hidden truths about the villainess's past that make her a more sympathetic figure.

    In my opinion the art quality is phenomenal, and the portrayal of each character's expressions really drives home the hard-hitting, emotional moments. I also like that the story is higher stakes and faster paced than most other villainess isekai manga I've tried. (Most of them are very fluffy and/or have the villainess win people's hearts too quickly.)
    ```

  - u/dogcomplex:
    ```
    [Only Villains Do That](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/40182/only-villains-do-that) \- villain, not villainess.  I've over-recommended this previous weeks but - throwing that on your list anyway
    ```

    - u/Flashbunny:
      ```
      While I like OVDT, I don't think it's the right genre. The "reincarnated as the villainess" subgenre is specifically about replacing the antagonist in a romance sim, not a general isekai as a villain. It tends to have a much greater focus on political maneuvering.
      ```

      - u/chiruochiba:
        ```
        It's not always a romance sim game. I've seen a few different setups, such as getting transported into a romance novel (such as in ["I Became the Wife of the Male Lead"](https://mangadex.org/title/79428c31-72f5-4fb0-8579-250f7933b2d5/i-became-the-wife-of-the-male-lead)), transported into a fairytale (such as in ["Not-Sew-Wicked Stepmom"](https://mangadex.org/title/e618f14a-58c0-448c-9eb7-ef30d2422f6f/not-sew-wicked-stepmom)), transported to be the villain's daughter in a xianxia novel (such as in ["I am the Precious Daughter of the Greatest Villain in a Martial Arts Novel "](https://mangadex.org/title/3c3ec507-7177-4770-9e59-a70dbf81aaa9/i-am-the-precious-daughter-of-the-greatest-villain-in-a-martial-arts-novel)), etc.

        The one commonality is that the PoV character is forced into a villainess role, and they have to win friends and influence people in order to avoid the tragic fate that's coming to them. Or sometimes the story takes place after the 'tragic fate' allready happened, which turns out to not be that bad, and the focus is on the 'villainess' living her carefree life in the aftermath. In contrast to male oriented isekai stories, the plot is usually focused on interpersonal drama and romance, with action scenes being rare, ranging from few to none.

          Add [The Calamity of a Reborn Witch](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/32908/the-calamity-of-a-reborn-witch) to that list. Girl gets reincarnated into a witch where fantasy Catholicism is very enthusiastic about witch hunts. She is reborn before the tragic fate occurs, but she retained the memories of the girl she replaced, and the girl's ghost (who she effectively killed by reincarnating into her) also sticks around. A bit tropey at times, but I remember enjoying it when I read it.

  I have a very specific itch I'm trying to scratch after rereading a few of Farla's old pokemon fanfics. Can anyone recommend a story where:

  * the story features a sapient, nonhuman POV (i.e., xenofiction, but specifically for nonhuman persons) 
  * the story features humans and in particular the POV character interacting with humans
  * most humans in the setting would *not* consider the POV character to be a person (or at least, consider the POV character to be a much lesser degree of person)

  Some examples:

  [Broken Things] (https://archiveofourown.org/works/21114674/chapters/50244281) (Several of the POV characters are pokemon, including a narcissistic vulpix with severe abandonment issues.)

  [Little Death] (https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/little-death-dune-xenofiction.985693/) (Dune fanfic from a sandworm perspective. Technically the sandworm isn't sapient, but the story is written as if it is, so it counts for this purpose.)

  [Dillusioned] (https://archiveofourown.org/works/33425191) (Pokemon fanfic. Snubbul POV. So basically a sapient pug realizes that it's very existence is animal abuse.)

    [Kitty Cat Kill Sat](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/46113/kitty-cat-kill-sat) by argusthecat

    Humanity reaches the stars, then forgets how. The only one left is an uplifted cat on a space station.

    It doesn't feature many humans, and the interaction is limited to using its space laser to save them from monsters (or themselves).

    [Fleabag: A Monster Evolution LitRPG](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/46620/fleabag-a-monster-evolution-litrpg) by SomeoneToForget

    Like KCKS it features and uplifted animal, in this case a dog who becomes a wolf and continues to evolve. It does interact with a human, but it's very slow, the author really drags out the details of its evolution.

    [War Queen](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/46850/war-queen) by Illthylian

    Humanity makes first contact with an alien race, which is promptly enslaved to fight in their space war.

    [Shade Touched](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/34473/shade-touched)
    by Zat

    An intelligent monster is adopted by two adventures.

    This was pretty popular a while back, but has been on hiatus for some time unfortunately. Still a fun read.

    I also like this setting a lot, someone just before you posted a similar but bit more broad request, I'll paste here my list i gave there:

    Pokemon fanfics:

    Backwards grin, I thought this was a mystery dungeon, hyphen, dreaming of family + a few comics like: its a hard enough life.

    On RR: Super minion, blue core, muds mission, everybody loves large chests, Valkyries shadow (tangentially related), I dont want to be the hive queen, owlnother world, salvos, dungeon core? Nah I think ill just get super wealthy instead,

    Other stories: I got reincarnated as a dungeon now what?, tiny snake god, I got reincarnated as a sword, Most Omnipotent Goddess, Oogways little owl, Hope and Silence in the hive, The culture meets 40k,

    Prob tones more, RR has a lot of low quality ones, some I included in the list even if I dropped them, but the non RR ones are all IMO very good.

    Blue Core on royalroad *kinda* fits? The story has a human turned into a dungeon core, but the human isn't quite the human of modern society, and isn't quite really human either. It gets revealed much later exactly what he is, and it's pretty interesting. He interacts with other humans, and dwarfs, elves, dragons, etc. 

    Most people in the setting don't really consider the POV character to be a person, but they do consider him to be *greater* than just a person. It also has explicit sex scenes, although they are labeled, and you can skip them without losing important plot points.

    Beware of Chicken is *stonks*. That graph goes up and to the right.

    If there's any stories on the RR top 20 that're a "new hotness" thing, it's Jackal and Orellen. That's not to say they're bad; I haven't read either of them. I've read nine out of the top 20 there. Vainquer wouldn't be there if it were being posted today, but it was the best thing that had ever been posted at the time; still, it's not nearly as good as, say, Never Die Twice.

    Seven out of eight of the top eight on the TWF top 20 all time deserve a slot in the top 20, though that might say rather a lot about the general quality of web fiction, since Wildbow is on there four times. There's some stuff there that's frankly garbage in the top 20, but for the most part it's solid works. (Unsong! And frankly there's some stuff in the 20-30 range that deserves to be in the top 20, like Katalepsis.)

    - u/sohois:
      ```
      > Beware of Chicken is stonks. That graph goes up and to the right.

      It certainly seems impervious to the precipitous drop in quality that occurred after volume 1, at least so far. But its estimated page length at least points to a stronger underlying feeling for the novel than some others. 

      It's weird to think, but web serials need to be several times as large as a typical book before you can make strong conclusions to their quality and direction.

          I worry for it.  Itâ€™s gonna fall apart like most power fantasyâ€™s. The MC has very little room for interesting character development, supporting characters are pretty standard, and the premise can only stay interesting for so long.
          ```

          - u/PastafarianGames:
            ```
            I... really don't see that angle. It's not a power fantasy; if anything, the MC's growing power and influence is getting him exactly what he *doesn't* want, and that's going to drive a whole lot of conflict both internal and external as he tries to deal with that while also dealing with, like, wanting coffee.

            Between that and the characters, who I think are varied and a delightful departure from the norm (seriously, the entire supporting cast has has dozens of atypical or unusual archetypes and the standard ones are... Tigu, An Ran, and Guo Daxian, and that's it?) I think the story's got easily a million more words' worth of legs if the author doesn't burn out.

      Getting ranked highly on RR is in large part about avoiding bad reviews. Those fics that are entrenched at the top are the first people see when they stumble around the site for the first time, so lots of people read them and give them good reviews on average. Meanwhile, there is only a limited amount of haters who review bomb everything. 

      The lifecycle of a decent fic, ratings wise goes something like this:

      1. Initially only people who really want to read the fic find it and read it. These people are either looking for some specific niche, or were recommended it directly. This results in high reviews generally, because they are happy the specific fic exists. 

      2. If luck is on the fics side and it's good enough, it will eventually enter one of the lists. This might be trending, rising stars, or whatever. Regardless, it's gonna get a lot more traffic from people for whom the fic isn't "tailored" and this will result in a drop in average ratings. 

      3. If quality and luck continues to hold, the fic might start to work it's way up the top rated lists, and this is usually where you go through a gauntlet of review-bombing from people who are (presumably) trying to influence the rankings. 

      4. An equilibrium is reached, and so long as the author doesn't do something extremely controversial that the crowd doesn't like, it's possible to entrench a position rather well even if never updating.

    I've read most of the top 20 list, and I dislike most of the fics on it.  Worm deserves the place (should be first, "a practical guide to evil" is sitting at number one and I hated the MC), and the other stuff by wildbow was good but not at the same level.   I've noticed many of the fictions I"ve dropped for being cringy, plot-holed bad stories that happen to have lots of chapters like Defiance of the Fall, Savage Divinity, Zombie Knight, and Salvos are hanging on that list.  Would not recommend the site for rational recs.

Any recommended stories along those lines?

  And another question: I've seen r!Animorphs: The Reckoning as highly recommended. I haven't really read any Animorphs, would I still be able to understand/appreciate this story without being familiar with the original material?

Funnily enough, I happened to read one of the author's other works recently ([Evil Eyes](https://archiveofourown.org/works/34632028/chapters/86214940)), which I quite enjoyed, despite the MC having a tendency to get stuck in his own head from time to time.

    Check out [Graviton](https://gravitonfanfic.substack.com/?sort=top). I haven't read it, but the writer is an economist, and I've read some of their worldbuilding and it looks thought out.

  Stumbled across [12 Miles Below](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/42367/12-miles-below) yesterday and it blew my mind. 

  Set in a post-post apocalyptic Earth where humanity exists in isolated underground cities and the frozen wastelands of the planet surface. Killer machines wander the land laying waste to any organic life they come across. 

  Our MC lives with his clan on the surface of the planet. Though the surface is safer, the wealth and resources the old world and the more successful post-apocalyptic civilizations are all trapped underground so exploring the underground is extremely important. Scavenging resources from the underground a crucial part of the surface dweller's civilization. 

  Our MC is an engineer working as a scavenger as he attempts to discover technologies from the past so he can help try to better his clan and humanity. 

  The story does a great job of building this fascinating world, characterization of the machines, and really keeping you engaged as a reader. It does fantastic job of handling the scifi elements of power suits, artificial intelligence, and other concepts without anything obviously seeming to be out of place. There are some fantasy elements, but they're done in a fairly logical manner with what so far seems to be a consistent set of rules. 

  I was very impressed with how the author tries their best to write the story while making sure their worldbuilding is follows a logical structure. Concepts like incentive structures, faith and traditions, ect are all written together in a fairly rational manner. If 's something pops up in the story, many times you can see that the author put the effort into thinking themselves how it came to be and how its existence might affect other things around it. There's a level of coherence regarding how everything interacts together.

  Highly, highly recommend a read. Big fan of this story. 

  The story actually started a couple months ago and so far 83 chapters have been released. That covers book 1 and the majority of book 2. I was so impressed and interested in reading the end of book 2 that I paid for the patreon and read through it. Satisfied and awaiting the start of book 3.

    How long are the books so far and how consistent is the release schedule?
    ```

    - u/Prince_Silk:
      ```
      Royalroad says the story is "967" pages and like I mentioned before the full book 1 + publicly released book 2 is 83 chapters. 

      No idea about release schedule since I binged the story in a day.

  So does anyone know of any deconstructions of medical dramas which show how dysfunctional hospitals and clinics would be if doctors and nurses actually acted the way they do on Grey's Anatomy, ER, and House?
  ```

- u/D0TheMath:
  ```
  I strongly recommend the movie [Fatman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuaWbUqAg0o). A spectacular deconstruction of Santa Clause, with what I would consider great worldbuilding, and debatably rational characters (better than what I'd expect from such a movie, though note there are many times where it prioritizes making ppl more badass than making them intelligent. >!looking at you, guy-who's-name-I-don't-remember who always shoots people for no reason after talking to them!<).

  Re: Yudkowsky's current rational fiction on Glowfic, [Mad Investor Chaos and the Woman of Asmodeus](https://www.glowfic.com/posts/4582):

  1. I have a problem of compulsively refreshing ongoing fiction for updates. Is there any way on Glowfic to subscribe to an RSS feed or something? Or, equivalently, is there some way to generically generate an RSS feed for websites that don't support that natively?
  2. Occasionally I'd like to discuss story developments with fellow readers, but Glowfic doesn't seem to have comments. Is there a discussion thread *anywhere*?

     * I considered making one as a Personal Blogpost on Less Wrong, but was worried that story-spoiling comments could get shown on the LW front page.
     * Also, it's a bit hard to discuss story developments when there are no chapter numbers to reference.

      Thanks a lot for this recommendation! Having looked [at the discord](https://glowfic.com/contact), I didn't initially see any story-specific discussion thread (the perils of using a tool like discord when you're unfamiliar with it, I guess), but [have now found it](https://discord.com/channels/294167563447828481/888216211693907998) after searching for "mad investor chaos".

      Glowfic is like... collaborative text- and character-based role-playing? Summary from [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_4Z2zdRKaSwZPm3S0X14DYoo7w46U_MZ4En6oOediNQ/edit#heading=h.rprib0keyjkp):

      >The short answer is that glowfic is a genre of play-by-post text roleplay mostly characterized by its historical origins. It borrows certain tropes and quirks from a parent RP tradition (that usually took place on LiveJournal or DreamWidth) and the rationalfic genre... Some of its defining/idiosyncratic features are, among other things: authors decided in advance (as opposed to anyone being allowed to join any threads), alternate universe versions of characters (original or not), heavy exploitation of magic, resourcefulness, ambition and hubris, suffering, and lots and lots of crossovers. Also so much shipping of everyone with everyone else, itâ€™s amazing.

      It's written with a co-author. [EY's post on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/yudkowsky/posts/10160074795314228).

  Anyone has any good quests to recommend me? Recently I got into a path unending and found it really enjoyable for skimming after I converted it into an epub. Anyone has some more decent ones? 

  &#x200B;

  I really enjoy cultivation stuff, so bonus points for that. I also like warhammer styled stuff. 

  &#x200B;

  Doesn't need to be a quest though, as long as there's enough content written I'm happy to find new cool stuff.
