  I think this is the type of chapter that feels weird when reading it as a webserial but important when read as a book. I'm more than happy for slightly pace breaking chapters if it makes the commulative product better

    Can confirm! Discovered this on Friday night, and just caught up. This was a relatively nice place to be left off.

    The only thing really worth noting from an archive reader perspective is after arc two everything really picked up in pace, which makes sense. Most of the mundane is gone, which made me slightly worried about the ending. Having the revisit here and in the post-soul damage reset really help the story flow better and eased my fears.
    ```

  18 restarts left

  things still to do this loop:

  - find the staff

  - acquire pet hydra

  - study hydra further to learn how to synchronize himself with his simulacrums

  - study how to fake the marker

  - contact 2 other pocket dimension mages that QI told them about

  - more study of blood magic and enhancement rituals to assist in learning dimensional magic (especially for Zach)

  - learn soul magic from QI (were the cranium rats able to report that Zorian was killing them? If so, I don't know how they can approach him for lessons)

  - another vault robbery with QI (again, iffy. also don't try to kill him this time?)

  - explanation of what he pulled out of QI's memories

  - utilize black room to increase their study time for dimensional/soul/blood magic

  - try new tactics to get ring (ally with other tribe to draw them out)

  - get Kael governmental support


  surprised he took Kirielle, not sure what they're going to do with her while gallivanting across the world


  Enough emphasis on Fortov that you suspect something is going to happen there ("He's useless and I don't like him." - no way that can backfire)
  ```

  - u/notagiantdolphin:
    ```
    I like how a lot of insanely difficult things are mentioned as a one sentence throw-away. Bits and pieces that used to be the focus of a chapter are now paragraphs. I wonder if they can eventually reduce this entire list down to a single paragraph of 'oh, then we broke the world over our knee so it'd listen to us'?

    Hell, even the reactions of other people to the loop are great. Taiven's fussing over Zorian's arm, Ilsa's concerned about Zorian's mental state (and ethical, I guess, because mind mage), Daimen is a little bit shocked at his brother being able to pull together an obscene amount of money. ZZ just look at all of this and go 'oh, my arm, well, next loop I'd better figure out how to touch my teacher with an obscenely powerful cosmic artefact so she can mass manufacture puppets for me' or 'Heh, that's funny. Let's go beat up my caretaker for stress relief.'.

    The first time they told people about the loop, their reactions added a lot to the story. This is even better - it's not even 'real' character development, but it's a great way to illustrate how bizarre it all is.
    ```

  - u/tjhance:
    ```
    yeah I really wonder where the narrative is going with Fortov. So far he is pretty flat; Zorian has this image of him as a good-for-nothing asshole, and the conversation between Fortov and Daimen just... kinda confirmed that.

    I'm kind of considering the possibility that Fortov is RR now:

    * RR "piggy-backing" off the time-loop and being an asshole fits with Fortov's character.
    * If Fortov were RR, he would want to mostly avoid Zorian (Zorian might notice something is off). Indeed, Fortov and Zorian mostly avoid each other during the month. Fortov might literally never notice that Zorian was acting differently restart-to-restart. The only time they interact is when Fortov wants Zorian to make the rash potion; he might attribute Zorian's different reactions to minor variations. (That said, it's hard to see how he wouldn't notice that sometimes Zorian takes Kirielle, which is a big strike against this theory.)
    * There's been a strange emphasis on how Fortov pushes Ibery into the bush with striking regularity. Why could this be? If Fortov were RR, he would try to act mostly the same in every restart. He might overcompensate, say, by always acting *exactly* the same way.
    * Zorian has no idea what Fortov does during the invasion. He has never seen Fortov during the invasion once, and I think someone drew attention to this at some point.
    * The difference in train car occupancy (near the end of Book 1) could be caused by Fortov doing something different.

    On the other hand:

    * No reason Fortov would be connected to Veyers.
    * No reason Fortov would want the invasion to succeed.
    * When is he spending all his time getting more powerful, if he's acting like a student all the time?
    * If Fortov were RR, why wouldn't he just wipe Zach's memories of Fortov and disappear? Is it because doing so would create too many ripples (e.g. through Zorian) and he wouldn't be able to change Zach's memory that much? ... maybe?
    * Presumably RR needs to be an expert soul-mage to tamper with the temp-marker, or able to reach soul-magic proficiency in 6 restarts. It's really unlikely that Fortov is this, unless Fortov is a natural soul mage in the same way Zorian is a natural mind mage, or something. That's a complexity penalty (although I wouldn't feel cheated if this were suddenly revealed at the end).

    I'd assign very low confidence to this theory, but it's not that unreasonable, I think.

      He only did that after RR left, meaning Fortov would go back to his loop-standard self.

It's really unlikely that Fortov is this, unless Fortov is a natural soul mage in the same way Zorian is a natural mind mage, or something. That's a complexity penalty (although I wouldn't feel cheated if this were suddenly revealed at the end).

      Fortov could have done exactly what Zorian did to become a good soul mage, use his natural talent as a mind mage to mind-rape soul mages for their knowledge.  We don't know if he's actually psychic or not, we just know that he's charming.  In fact, we **very explicitly** don't know if he's psychic or not, since Zorian never took an interest in him.
      ```

      - u/GoXDS:
        ```
        except Zorian has seen and been within range of and talked to Fortov. and as he has told Damien, he'd know instantly since Open show up slightly differently to his mind sense. doesn't exclude the possibility that he's a mind mage, but definitely not a psychic nor natural talent for it (Open).

        /u/tjhance Fortov himself already explained that (tho you could think that's just an excuse, but unlikely). he was going for extreme measures since nothing else was working

        RR is basically 100% no longer in the loop (as RR at least) so suspecting these details to be pointing to him being RR is going red herring territory
        ```

        - u/tjhance:
          ```
          yeah so I was trying to get as was something like the following:
          (i) Normally, Fortov pushes Ibery into the bush, for the reasons he describes (ii) if Fortov becomes RR, he continues to do so just b/c he did the first time and feels he need to be consistent

          ummm but yeah, as you point out, he continues to overly-consistently do the bush incident, even after RR leaves (i think? zorian never says otherwise, but zorian doesn't do the normal school-route much after RR leaves), so yeah, it doesn't make any sense to say that his over-consistency is evidence of fortov=RR.

          I mostly think fortov=RR is a funny theory, in the sense of the story saying "yeah, you didn't think RR was going to be someone close to zorian because obviously they would notice each other, but don't you remember how much zorian and fortov ignored each other?" I'm not putting any money on it.

          But actually I dunno where else the story would be going with Fortov, other than a classic "brothers make up and learn to help each other" arc, which hasn't even begun yet
          ```

        - u/Ardvarkeating101:
          ```
          As mentioned, there are techniques to activate dormant bloodline abilities, Zorian considers developing one for Kirielle
          ```

          - u/GoXDS:
            ```
            yes; however, Zorian has interacted with Fortov and RR before RR left and after Zorian has opened up his Open senses and did *not* see either as Open. plus RR's mind magic was clumsy
            ```

          - u/xland44:
            ```
            Where was this mentioned?
            ```

            - u/distrofijus:
              ```
              It was during the story about Veyers Boranova. The ritual was lost, he was doing some fishy bloodline ignition and was unstable since.
              ```

      - u/mataamad:
        ```
        In the past I've discounted Fortov as a possibility of being red robe as I thought he had no possible direct link to Zach except through Zorian which means pre-Zorian entering the time loop it'd be unlikely for Fortov to find out that Zach is looping (I also discount people like Silverlake, and Zorian's parents for the same reason).

        I find the possibility of Fortov being a natural mind mage and having somehow acquired some basic training in it super interesting because it provides a potential path for him to find out about Zach and so become red robe.

        It still seems like a pretty big stretch but it makes him a bit more likely.  If by leaving the loop Red Robe Fortov has been replaced with an oblivious copy then at least the natural mind mage ability is something testable to determine whether he has the potential to become red robe (unlike say Veyers who it's probably impossible to tell whether he's red robe).


        For what it's worth here are my current possible red robe candidates:

        * **Zach** - a rogue simularican, then mindwiped Zach's memory of the ability to create them and do mind magic.  Requires some pretty hefty details like a simularican that's a (perfect?) clone of Zach's body that somehow gets his soul marker.
        * **Veyers** - 'obvious red herring'
        * **Spear of Resolve** - this one is pretty reachy, but with their crazy mind magic abilities they could easily have found out about Zach and used a random human pawn to do their bidding (a plus side is they don't even need to turn temporary markers into permanent ones - just copy a mind packet into your pawn and mind control the human into giving you the packet at the start of each restart.  After 6 restarts, select a new pawn.  Requires being able to get the Lich's crown every 6 restarts and a few other crazy things and the Zorian interactions don't make sense anymore (unless there was a human that somehow didn't return a mind packet so spear of resolve accidentally left the time loop for an unknown amount of time until Zorian stumbled into it).
        * **Eldemar prince** - would be an 'unnamed' red robe - would be kind of disappointing
        * **Rat controller** - would probably be an 'unnamed' red robe - would be kind of disappointing - could be shenanigans similar to the Spear of Resolve stuff.  Rat controller seems to be QI, so it implies that in this case he probably did the pawn control type stuff that I said the spiders could do.  One point towards this is that it seems super unlikely that the rats wouldn't find out about Zach at least some of the time.  One point against is QI not seeming to be in on it when Zorian got bought into the loop.
        * **Dragon cult member** - would be an 'unnamed' red robe - would be kind of disappointing
        * **(now Fortov too)** - strange loop stability, something happens on the train, tenuous link to Zach


        In picking Red Robe I'm assuming it'll be following the usual 'rationalist' literature theme of it being an actual solvable problem and also that it'll actually be a *good* reveal which eliminates a bunch of minor possibilities that'd just be pretty dumb.  Honestly I've reviewed every named character in Mother of Learning and I'm a bit stumped for answers that fit perfectly.
        ```

        - u/tjhance:
          ```
          Stumped is how I feel as well. 

          What about Sudomir? I feel he checks the most boxes. 

          * skilled in soul magic
          * has incentive to help the invasion and make it as efficient as possible (to kill more people and collect souls)
          * is connected to the cult
          * doesn't appear in the story before RR leaves the loop

          It would be a bit disappointing (he's not that interesting of a character...) but it makes a lot of sense
          ```

          - u/mataamad:
            ```
            I found it interesting that you listed

            * doesn't appear in the story before RR leaves the loop

            As a good thing.

            I've always considered people who aren't in the story until red robe is gone to be very unlikely for narrative reason but your logic makes a lot of sense.

            I had listed Sudomir as 'no real reason to suspect' just because I didn't think he really had a good direct connection to Zach, but I suppose he was reasonably likely to interact with him when Zach is messing with invasino stuff.

            Mostly I agree that he's not really an interesting character and wouldn't be a very satisfying answer.  He'd basically be someone that'd fit the 'random cult of the dragon below' bullet I had listed.  I wouldn't be surprised if the real read robe used QI's and/or Sudomir's knowledge to turn the temporary marker permanent though.
            ```

            - u/tjhance:
              ```
              I agree about the narrative thing. I just meant that, as far as we know, he may be acting completely differently before and after RR leaves. This can't be said of very many characters.
              ```

            - u/icesharkk:
              ```
              If RR leaving causes a "normal" person to be left behind then it could absolutely be someone who didn't show up on the radar until after RR left. RR was to busy to play with ZZ and any interest the showed would have given zorian away. Based on zorian successfully remaining hidden thay increases the prior probability that zorian never interfaced with RRs civilian identity prior to RR leaving the loop

              Edit: grammar
              ```

        - u/woschtl:
          ```
          What about Tesen Zveri, Zack's caretaker? He has an obvious connection to Zack and the Noveda family, he is a powerful mage, he cheated Zack out of his inheritance and seems shady in general, and he is responsible for donating the Sovereign Gate to the Crown. It's possible that he has special knowledge about the Gate and he might even be connected to starting the time loop in the first place. In that case, he would be in a good position to become Red Robe.

          On the other hand, it's strange that he would allow himself to be beaten and humiliated by Zack repeatedly (which happened before Red Robe left the loop). But we only know that indirectly, and I don't think Zorian ever met him when Red Robe was still in the time loop.

          Is there anything in the story that obviously exonerates him? Or maybe more hints that he is Red Robe? Couldn't find anything.

          (Related: What about the two researchers in the time magic facility? Did Zack interact with the Sovereign Gate in the real world to start the time loop? If yes, they may have been there.)
          ```

          - u/mataamad:
            ```
            That is true.  I guess the only thing I could add is that Tesen wouldn't really be a very satisfying answer.

            I've been wondering for a while if there are any hints in the story about how Zach got in the time loop. I certainly haven't found anything concerete.  Tesen is one of the more likely people to have initiated it if Zach was inserted as a necessary pawn because of his heritage or something (which is pretty likely).  I think the story implies that the sovereign gate ended up with the Eldemar because of Tesen selling off all of the Noveda belongings but maybe it was on purpose...

            I've been leaning towards the gate turning on 1 month early being some sort of divine failsafe because of the imminent primordial summoning (and sucking Zach in because of his heritage) but there isn't any hard evidence for that either.


            In terms of the researchers (Krantin Keklos and Aread) , they're first introduced in Chapter 54 and they're only ever mentioned by name in that chapter.  Seems super unlikely that they'd be anything bit bit characters for narrative reasons but it's possible.
            ```

        - u/addmoreice:
          ```
          I like Veyer's lawyer as RR.  


          Has contacts with the cult. has a connection to veyers \*and\* possibly zack if we consider zack might have tried to get a lawyer to help him with his caretaker (it's said he sought help in this very way)...who he might then explain 'hey I'm a time traveler, I can totally get more info, let me set this up' which would have quickly backfired on him with \*this\* lawyer. this would also explain the veyers being 'soul killed', it cuts the link between zack and the lawyer/RR. After all, imagine you have finally gotten into the loop and the only connection between you and zack is this veyers kid...who also starts to loop each time in your damn house when you are trying to get your learning groove on. The moment you have the soul kill ability? you use it! (then discover the new issue).
          ```

          - u/es_carva:
            ```
            I like your idea of RR making a mistake with the dagger, perhaps he edited Zach's memories so he wouldn't go looking for the now dead Veyers. 

            However, I don't think he is RR. He is too unskilled to alter his marker within 6 months (is he even a mage?), and on top of this, we know RR was able to more or less shrug off bullets (from Zorian) on day 1 of the timeloop, so he likely had a bloodline before the whole thing started.
            ```

            - u/Capt-POTATO:
              ```
              I was under the impression the shrugging off bullets came from the prexisting protective enchantments on the eponymous robe.
              ```

            - u/addmoreice:
              ```
              your first concern is definitely valid.

              The second though, he *was* the last member of a noble house, a peripheral one but still. This is the main reason I like him for it so much. He can feel the same thing zack has (so could end up being close emotionally), end up being close professionally (solving his problem), has access and connections within the cult of the dragon below, and has some basic mind magic skills. This makes him my number one guess.
              ```

      - u/tjhance:
        ```
        > He only did that after RR left, meaning Fortov would go back to his loop-standard self.

        You mean he only took Kirielle after RR left? That's not true. Zorian first takes Kirielle in chapter 14; RR soul-kills the Aranea in chapter 26.
        ```

    - u/eroticas:
      ```
      Other than the fact that Fortov's narratively a bit of a Chekhov's gun at this point, is there any reason to believe he's important in any way?

      (My shot in the dark guess is that he's somehow a looper who became a good guy through the experience who has to pretend to be his past bad self to stay in character, and his goodness will complete Zorian's growth arc)
      ```

      - u/icesharkk:
        ```
        That seems very anti rational. I'm hoping fortov is a dick and not RR. Sometimes your family members are just assholes and that's that.
        ```

  - u/distrofijus:
    ```
    other things (for other people): 

     * silverlake to brew and test her potion 

     * acquire the other beast (worm) from sulrothum and store it along the hydra in orb - make sure they don't attack each other. They may even know each other. Use them as meat shield on royal vault assault to defend while investigating ward stone or to fight off invasion/primordial summoning 

     * test what happens if they drill the well by Bakora gates Silent Doorway Adepts live and see the effects (preferably by the end of restart first to work out kinks. If it works in short term - check what are longer term consequences - drill the hole at the start). 

     * putting tracker on QI. This is kinda risky. The lich is very sensitive and would notice it and after he finds it after restart things might get hairy. Also to be used in tracking his fall back place (mark him while starting fight. After he leaves the current body, track/capture his soul/phylactery. Remove tracker to not cause suspicion on hm. The potential whereabouts of the lich sounds very lucrative, but too risky. Getting hold of his phylactery would open a lot of options / bargaining points.
    ```

- u/thrasherfect92:
  ```
  I think the best part of this chapter was Ilsa asking Zorian if he was an average mage. He responds that he is, however, from his perspective everything seems normal to him.  

  Even Damien pointed out that even if you accounted for the years spent in the time loop, Zorian is only a couple years younger than him. However, he has had practically exponential growth in nearly all magical fields. I think Ilsa is also starting to take notice that Zorian isn't an average mage. Even taking into perspective the extra time and resources an "average" mage wouldn't be able to accomplish what Zorian has.
  ```

  - u/notagiantdolphin:
    ```
    Makes you wonder if he would be another 'world class' talent if he discovered his natural mind magic in time to prevent it greatly affecting his social development. Or if Daimen helped him, the sod. 


    Also god I hope Fortov turns out to be something interesting in the story rather than the world's biggest red herring. Maybe he soulkilled Volkov with the knife and leaving the loop just replaces your soul outside while removing the internal you's marker. The entire thing a massive fuck you to Zorian and Daimen for being cleverer than him. The ultimate fucked up family.
    ```

    - u/crazyfoxdemon:
      ```
      I think that's the ticket. His unknown potential actually hindering him early on is what gave him and others the impression that he was 'average'. Even from a few antecedents from Damien gives us the impression that Zorian was not your average kid. If he wasn't forced to cope with an unknown handicap, who knows how far he could've gotten.
      ```

    - u/therealflinchy:
      ```
      He'd still have been hampered by his tiny mana pool to be fair

      I'm also on team fortov 4 rr
      ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    It's interesting, because Zach is so much of a combat mage that when we compare the two Zach seems so far ahead. But a lot of that has to do with his massive mana reserves. Zorian seems to have made a lot of out of his 8 years than Zach of his decades.
    ```

    - u/thrasherfect92:
      ```
      I think part of that could be because Zorian is more introverted than Zach. Zach spent time trying to get to know all of his classmates and some time seducing ladies.
      ```

    - u/signspace13:
      ```
      It's great when later Zach states that he think some people would be more afraid of zorian, simply due to his cunning and personality (also mind magic), Zach has never thought of himself as greater than Zorian.
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        That is an interesting thing about Zach's personality. Even when he was a crazy good combat mage in class 8 years ago, he treated Zorian as more of a peer than arguably Zorian  treated Zach before the month began. Zorian has grown a bit, but it's still an interesting contrast that I don't think would have happened had it been the other way around.
        ```

  - u/MacDancer:
    ```
    He's a perfectly normal average guy who spent eight years working diligently to learn as much as he could. So, abnormal on work ethic.
    ```

    - u/silver7017:
      ```
      he also has a lower than average mana magnitude, which implies a higher ceiling for shaping skill. something that would be of questionable worth in the real world, but is probably a good candidate for the reason zorian got as far as he has (second only to his natural mind magic, that is).

    - u/Wolpertinger:
      ```
      Average mages a decade out of school don't get to experiment with magic in essentially suicidal ways and just get a redo if they die, while simultaneously being encouraged to desperately improve as quickly as possible due to various life-threatening circumstances. They also don't get to game people by repeatedly interacting with them until they learn how to act with someone to make them teach them everything they know, or get to rob other people to have it undone next loop. There's also all the exceptional teachers he would have never interacted with under normal circumstances, as well.
      ```

      - u/thrawnca:
        ```
        You forgot the part where he ransacked the minds of a whole swag of people who know restricted/illegal magic; Sudomir is notable among them.

        Plus, piggybacking on Zach's much longer experience; the two of them wandered around chasing necromancers etc when looking for the simulacrum spell, and Zorian made sure to pick up any good loot, besides having Zach tutor him directly.
        ```

      - u/sicutumbo:
        ```
        He also made it so that he is completely unable to forget something if he puts any effort into remembering it. That has to make learning things vastly easier, and means his skills won't degrade over time.
        ```

  - u/therealflinchy:
    ```
    Yeah, and given motivation and effort is a big part of what makes someone average or not

    Zach had decades before zorian, and he had some mad combat skills but was otherwise a pretty useless mage. Even Zach, since zorian got on board, improved exponentially. And the only reason he learns SOME things faster than zorian, is he has a magnitude larger pool of mana to draw from.

    It's pretty clear that improved mental state zorian is a pretty highly talented mage

    So it's a pretty small leap of logic to assume that fortov likely has some natural talent too?

  I wonder if Alanic will try to find QI's phylactery.

    I'm pretty sure she has already been doing this every loop she has been informed. After all, she knows how to get out of the loop: just open up a tunnel through a primordial cage and walk through it. Dangerous as heck sure, but since she would be destroyed at the end of the loop anyway, she might as well chance it. 

    And so when Z&Z finally exit the loop, they are going to find a whole bunch of Silverlakes outside.

        That is only if you leave the loop by asking the Gate Guardian to swap your souls. A tunnel through a primordial cage is an actual physical tunnel, that you can bring your physical body through. So there would be multiple copies of you.

            It is never specified how old she is exactly, but she *is* immortal.

            Her problem is just that her current immortality is somewhat defective: Although her lifespan is now indefinite, her body is still that of an old woman, so she suffers various symptoms of old age like wrinkles, random aches, etc. Nothing that would kill her, but annoying nonetheless. She is working on a potion that allows her to regain her youth so she doesn't have to endure all these old age ailments anymore.

            > And as I said in another comment - I was under the impression the loop wasn't a physical recreation with physical bodies, just souls etc being simulated

            Hm? Where did that theory come from? As far as I remember Z&Z have been treating the loop as an actual physical pocket dimension that is massively time-accelerated, containing total copies of everything (souls, physical bodies, etc.) except the spiritual planes.

    Mm nope. Xvim doesn't have keen sense about soul. They most likely take over some task out of Zorian's to do list; freeing his time so that it be used for tinkering marker. Xvim also supposedly coax other mages into sharing their most prized expertise. We haven't got mention of him having a break on that matter.

    I disagree wholeheartedly. If you do that, the characters might as well be dead, in unfeeling and unthinking sense. Getting a glimpse into how they cope with new reality shows they're indeed living in the story.  

    edit: I believe it's not necessary, but it's good to add that *conservation of detail* is of higher priority when including supporting character's reaction into a chapter. Or, like Zorian opinion on Neolu's naivete, it's cute in small dose.

    This chapter was about 6.5k words, and the last chapter was about 10k, so it's shorter than last chapter.  Overall, though, most chapters are closer to 6-7k words, so it's not shorter than *normal*.

    There was a lot of dialogue and not a lot of new things, since a large part of the chapter was Zorian explaining things to Ilsa and Ilsa wrapping her head around it.  Necessary, but it eats up a lot of words on stuff that, from our perspective, has already been trodden.

        >Character development isn't filler.

        I completely agree! Many of the chapters where we learn more about Taiven, Xvim, Kael, Ilsa, or others are fantastic.

        But we didn't really learn anything new this chapter. If this was a sitcom or anime, this chapter would be the equivalent of a flashback episode. Every section was essentially a recap.

        Ilsa's huge section felt nearly identical to the earlier train rides with Kirielle, just with a couple interjections of things we already knew.  Unlike when Taiven or Xvim first started believing in the loop, her reactions just didn't feel right.

        Daimen's section, which made up most of the rest, was even worse in that regard. 

        We learned that Z&Z are planning to take other people out of the loop with them, and that they're mounting a new expedition. That's about it.

        If MoL was released as a book, I doubt anyone would really notice, but when it's released chapter by chapter, it hits a little harder. You have weeks of built up anticipation for each chapter, and they don't all measure up the same.  Especially with the level of hype other, more interesting chapters have created.

        I think people were hoping to see people interacting with others they hadn't really talked to before, conducting raids, or even just sharing new backstories. The fact that people can develop inside the loop was exciting.
        ```

        - u/LuckyWandering:
          ```
          well, it's more like a transition chapter than a filler chapter. It's not supposed to describe them believing the loop so much, but their curiosity now about the implications of the loop and their temporary ability to gain from it. 

          And yes, it feels similar to every other ride with Kirielle - this portrays how everyone has an immediate desire to satisfy Questions about the situation, but such discussions are limited by the need to preserve the quasi-secret nature of their situation within public contexts.

          I'm sure we'll get to people conducting efforts with new allies, but we barely knew who was receiving markers before, and spending some time with their concerns about being included also signals to us that they aren't viewed as tools by Z&Z, as explicitly described in the chapter as well.

          Can't really say I had a handle on Damien's personality to expect something specific from him, and I think interactions with Ilsa were meant to be representative for all the people they don't have close relationships with. These people are now going to have to start 'opening up' but are understandably somewhat wary at first and spend more time initially observing Z& Z to see the effect /implications of the loop.

        I'm not sure where I read this theory, but someone said it'd be funny (read: annoyingly funny) if Fortov has a really useful clue and turns out to be key to them getting out. That would burn Zorian like nothing else haha. 

        I don't think he's Red Robe, although that does have a nice symmetry to it (in order to live up to Daimens shadow, the two brothers both use the loop but in a different way altogether). However, Fortov does seem to be good natured (checking up on Zorian and Kiri when Zach punches, has a believable excuse for Ibery purple creeper scene, and when offended at Daimen Zorian notes that the normally easy going Fortov was quite angry with Daimen) so I don't think he's RR.
        ```

        - u/icesharkk:
          ```
          Much of that could just be post RR leaving the loop. At which point Fortov would have either reverted or been soul dead. Since fortov is alive he's either not RR or he's just post RR normal Fortov
          ```

          - u/I-want-pulao:
            ```
            That makes sense. However, from Ch 1- Ch26 (Soulkill), Fortov keeps pushing Ibery into the patch. Also, there are a few restarts when Zorian takes Kirielle with him. Even if Fortov during Ch1-26 is a simulacrum, he should note these changes because they occur so early in the loop. So my guess is that he isn't RR.
            ```

            - u/icesharkk:
              ```
              Logical. I don't want Fortov to be RR but I did want to point out the soulkill revert logic since it applies to several powerful characters. Hell RR could be Silverlake and she could have engraved a message on the wall lot the primordial cell for herself to find. She could do that now even without being RR.


              Have I mention that bringing Silverlake into the loop was a terrible idea.

                Honestly, I'm glad that RR is still a mystery. nobody103 has played this pretty close to his chest, I'm looking forward to seeing the reveal at the end. I'm guessing we won't find out until ZnZ leave the loop, and even then it might take a while as everyone would want to lay low to begin with (apart from using information to make opening moves like the cranium rat swarm hunt, save Alanic et al, etc)

- u/ShiranaiWakaranai:

  Hmm? Now that I think about it, the temporary marker mechanism is really strange. At first, I thought the marker's degradation or removal would permanently scar the target's soul in some way, making it impossible to mark them again in the same restart. But since everyone without a working marker gets a new soul in the next restart (thus losing all their magic growth and memories), their souls should be markable again in the next restart.

  Yet now we're told that it is impossible to mark a target again for 12 restarts. So some other mechanism has to be keeping count for those 12 restarts, and it can't be a part of the target's soul since their souls get replaced every restart...

    This could be a security measure for the benefit of the controller. Temporarily marked people have huge incentive to become the controller somehow or blackmail the controller to let them survive the loop with memories.

  1. Taiven's throwaway comment re there being 3 of her, meaning there will be at least 2 of her walking around if they just walk out of the loop. How easy will this be when not everyone is Zorian and a soul/mind mage (ie, they can't do a mind swap/soul eject)?
  2. I liked Ilsa as a conduit into the thought processes of other people who are not members of the conspiracy. Although in the edited book (when it's released etc) this scene should be really fun to watch as they ask questions and get a temp marker in exchange.

    > How easy will this be when not everyone is Zorian and a soul/mind mage (ie, they can't do a mind swap/soul eject)?

    My understanding is that there's three ways out of the time loop: either you trick the Sovereign Gate Guardian into thinking you are the controller and ask him to let you leave, you use the 5 keys to force the controller to let you leave, or you open up an a tunnel through a primordial cage from inside the time loop to the outside. 

    If the last method is used, anyone can leave the time loop, regardless of skill, since they just need to walk through the tunnel. There just needs to be some skilled mages "carrying" the party, maintaining the tunnel and casting spells to prevent whatever primordial is in the cage from killing them all.

          This is a world where mana signatures are kept and it's hard to fool identity sensors.

          This is also a world in which Zach and Zorian want to remain as low key as possible. If they have two of a few people running around, with those people nowhere near as powerful or able to keep their minds protected, bye bye to Zach and Zorian's privacy. 

          Thirdly, what does this mean for everyone with copies? I'm sure original!Zorian would take the offer to forget his family and go do his own thing, but not everyone will be willing to live in anonymity and hiding.

            They do? How would that work? When they exit the time loop, they have to deal with the Invasion of Cyoria by QI, the soul trap of Sudomir, the Cult of the Dragon Below and its connections to the Mage Guild, possibly the Primordial they unleash, and worst of all: Red Robe, who has gone through tons of loop iterations without having his mind messed with like Zach, and will help out all of the above enemies.

            If they do nothing, the Primordial is almost certainly going to be unleashed and wreck havoc on the entire continent. And it will never stop or go away on its own because it isn't a spiritual summon. The only way to stop that is to go fight all the enemies, which seems impossible to do so while remaining low key. They aren't going to have any privacy unless everyone dies or Zorian forcefully regains their privacy by mind wiping everyone.

            > Thirdly, what does this mean for everyone with copies? I'm sure original!Zorian would take the offer to forget his family and go do his own thing, but not everyone will be willing to live in anonymity and hiding.

            I don't see what the big deal is. They don't have to live in anonymity or hiding. The duplicates are just like having finding a long lost identical twin. Just tell the truth or call it a magical accident caused by the planetary alignment. While it may cause some difficulties adjusting to life with duplicates, it's a minor issue compared to the invasion of Cyoria.

The problems caused by such a battle far outweigh the problems caused by having duplicates of people. The former may even solve the latter because tons of people (including originals/duplicates) will die.

                  there's inheritance, living space, current positions, relationships. this is not only a huge problem to solve for those accommodating the two, it's also a headache for the two people. who gets what? 

                  how does the government hold people accountable for any crimes? even if the situation in which the government must check never happens, they have to consider it ahead of time. if one is convicted, how do you know which one did it? must you jail both of them since they're "exactly" the same person so the "innocent" one would/could do the same?
