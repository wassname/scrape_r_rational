  The perfect example on [why intelligence isn't the opposite of stupidity](http://lesswrong.com/lw/lw/reversed_stupidity_is_not_intelligence/). Harry in this story behaves like an average person *imagines* hyper-intelligent people to behave, and the story is written around him so it doesn't become a problem.

    Yeah, that's what I was thinking. Given the parallels to HPMOR and the fact that it's far less realistic and rationalist, it almost feels like a how-not-to-write-like-Eliezer guide.
