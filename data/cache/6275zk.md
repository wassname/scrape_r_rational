## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  I was brainstorming explanations for medieval stasis in a fantasy setting, and I stumbled upon this: what if there just isn't enough metal?

  Here are the rules I have in mind:

  * Very little iron and copper.
  * Very little of [whatever other chemical ends up causing trouble; for now I can think of sulphur].
  * Earth-like amounts of other elements. (Not sure about lead; on one hand it doesn't ruin medieval stasis, but on the other hand its overuse in place of iron and copper would make lead poisoning super common and that's icky.)
  * Som *non-smeltable* fantasy materials (troll bone, ironwood...) that are as hard as iron and somewhat common.
  * Some kind of magic I haven't decided yet. Might be used (sparingly) to fix unwanted aspects of the setting. Definitely no magitech.

  Here are some consequences I can think of, after the setting has matured for millenias:

  * No industrial revolution. No engines. No small or complex machines.

  * Movable type is doable. If lead is scarce, tin should do it. That means you can have a scientific revolution, mass literacy, newspapers... It just doesn't translate into that much wealth-generating technology.

  * Cloth is the one sector that could quite possibly reach industrial-revolution levels. Water-powered looms should be buildable without iron.

  * Tools are a big bottleneck. You can carve them out of troll bone, but that can't be mass-produced or recycled. In the specific case of knives, there's a regression issue (can't carve a troll-bone knife without using a better knife) which has to bottom out in *highly* coveted metal or magic knives. Probably a lot of flintknapping for everyday use.

  * Agriculture is hampered by a lack of cheap tools, but accumulated knowledge of e.g. crop rotation means it's still very productive, supporting many specialist jobs.

  * Plumbing can be done using either pottery or soft metals. Given the accumulation of medical knowledge (and bricks), large cities most likely have sewers, maybe even running water.

  * Glass is not *cheap* but still fairly common (because of the larger pool of specialists).

  * Spears, arrows, and maces are more economical than swords.

  * No chainmail; you jump straight from leather to ironwood plate.

  * Gunpowder may be widely known, but without affordable sulphur it's just a curiosity. (Banning iron alone isn't enough; the heavy use of grenades would twist the setting too far from what I want.)

  * The food surplus allows fairly large professional armies. But lack of guns (as an easy weapon to teach) prevents mass conscription.

  * Armies use hot air balloons for scouting. (If we add some wind-control magic, they could also be used for travel by rich individuals.)

  So, without having to turn your brain off, you get a world of classic fantasy that avoids the grim'n'gritty "everyone is a pustulent dirt farmer except nobles and tacked-on adventurers", and has a few exotic anachronisms (in both directions). That sounds like a fun place to adventure. 

  It also gives lots of options for "mundane loot" that is non-magical yet exciting, which I like.

  Thoughts?

    Cool! A few ideas/thoughts:

    Wasn't this kinda the plot of that one weird Orson Scott Card book? 

    Obsidian is much more valuable for arrow tips than IRL. 

    Ceramics are definitely a place to explore, they can be sharp and strong and are pretty basic in material. Ceramic studded leather could work kinda like a modern bulletproof vest, etc. 

    Salt trade unaffected, basically. 

    Nicrome alloy wire to make ceramic composites

    Gold Nickel alloys seem promising. 

    Basically, I think Ceramics are pretty powerful here.

    I like this a lot. A few thoughts and potential problems:

    * Carpentry will be rudimentary and expensive. You can either buy extremely expensive cutting tools like saws and chisels, or be stuck working with stone axes. You can almost forget about nails and ironwood. Rudimentary spears made from branches should be easy enough though.

    * Expensive and less common wagons and ships, due to the carpentry issue. This makes traders richer, but prices for everything will tend to be higher. Military logistics will have to rely heavily on locally sourcing materials as needed.

    * Little limestone. Limestone quarries seem unlikely without affordable metal tools. This means that cement will be quite expensive.

    * Expensive masonry, no castles. Stones that can be hand-manipulated and fractured against other stones will be fairly easy to shape. Arrowheads and spearpoints, no problem. However, large stone blocks are not going to be very feasible to carve out without extremely expensive metal tools. Without large stone blocks and cement, you're not going to have large stone structures. Bricks are also unlikely to see much use without cement.

    * Ubiquitous wattle and daub. About the only materials which are plentiful and easily worked with affordable tools would be sticks and mud.

    * Slings and oil-based incendiaries are also likely to be significant weapons in this setting. Slings and their ammo are dirt-cheap. Ceramic flasks of oil with lit rags should work well against the occasional noble with metal or ironwood plate armor.

      How viable are brick/rock and clay fortifications? Too brittle, too expensive?
      ```

      - u/Norseman2:
        ```
        Too expensive. You'd need to locate a limestone quarry and get people with metal tools to start collecting it for you. You'd need other people with metal tools to craft and maintain wagons and/or ships to transport the limestone. Also, you're either hiring very rich people who own their own metal tools, or you're buying the tools and hiring guards to make sure that your workers don't run off with the tools.
        ```

        - u/NotACauldronAgent:
          ```
          What about brick/adobe? Neither clay nor straw are penalized, and kilns are only slightly weakened.
          ```

          - u/Norseman2:
            ```
            Adobe is a mud brick. It's not fired, just dried. The adobe bricks are then held together with mud used as a mortar. It still has essentially all of the same benefits and disadvantages of wattle and daub construction. It's a weak material which rapidly erodes in rain, though the erosion can be managed with a shingled ceramic roof. It may afford you some brief protection in combat, but simple stone tools will chew through it easily.

            Fired clay bricks would offer better protection, but you're not going to have affordable cement mortar to bind them together. You could use mud for mortar, but then you return to most of the same problems you had originally with adobe bricks. It would be tougher than dirt, but still wouldn't stand up to much abuse compared to a stone wall.

            Very large clay bricks (like 6 ft. long by 3 ft. wide, by 2 ft. tall) would be about the toughest barrier you could make, although the sheer size would be very challenging. Pottery tends to explode when there's moisture trapped in it, and I have a hard time imaging how you'd make such a large brick and get it thoroughly dried for firing. It would probably also take a very long time and large amounts of fuel to fire bricks that large. The cost of all that might be enough to make it pointless.

            The best cheap fortification I can imagine would be a wall made with clay bricks with shards of broken glass sticking out on one side, and a moat immediately in front of the wall. Even with smaller bricks and mud for mortar, you could still probably make that wall about 15-20 feet high. As long as the moat is mostly at least 15 feet deep and 30 feet wide, I suspect it would be a fairly challenging defense to overcome.

    This is something that I was considering for a setting, a few years back. Are you intending to use this for a particular setting? I could hand off some of my stuff to you if you'd like. 

    Something to keep in mind: humans need iron and copper to live. Instead of making them exist only in small quantities, just make it so that they don't exist in bulk form.
    ```

  - u/buckykat:

    Uh, what about blood? Humans, and most other creatures with blood use iron as part of that biochemistry. We need a bit of it in food to not be anemic, which means we need a bit of it in the soil for it to get into the food chain, which means we need iron in our planetary crust, which undercuts the whole concept.

    EDIT: what this reminds me of is [this](http://lesswrong.com/lw/hq/universal_fire/) essay of the sequences. You can't change just one thing.
    ```

  - u/CreationBlues:
    ```
    There is a minimum environmental iron necessary for human life, though, with 1-2 milligrams a day required. The body further has about 4-5 grams of iron. Since chemistry is still a thing that can happen in your world (and glass is far far more important than iron) it might be a project for an empire to refine iron out of biological sources. In fact, that's exactly what [Primitive Technology](https://youtube.com/watch?v=P73REgj-3UE&feature=youtu.be) did when he smelted iron. Bog iron is the same thing, just fossilized. Earth gets a lot of it's color from iron, from oarange, red, and yellow to brown and black.

    Sulfur is also a problem. Namely, it's water soluble, so it will almost always form deposits. It's also even easier to obtain from organic sources, since humans need almost a gram of sulfur a day to survive.

    Of course, both of those facts make iron and sulfur harder and more expensive to produce. However, it proves it's not impossible to accumulate iron and sulfur, and you should take that into consideration.

    I think [Riverworld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riverworld) has a similar premise about limited metal supply.  Can't tell you too much about the world building, I watched the mini-series and never read the books.

    Why can't you make a steam engine from stone? Clockwork from tin? Cables from silver?
