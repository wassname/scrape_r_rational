  Hi! Many enjoyable things about this chapter. 

  First and foremost, the battle. As our first example of a kage-level battle, there was something rather satisfying at seeing them throw out massive jutsu all over the place. Mentally, however, there was a lot less going on than in the Kakashi-Zabuza debacle. While this does make some sense to me, seeing as both major parties were (almost overly-)confident of their victories... I still felt that the weaker attackers who had preparation time (Zabuza and Haku) could have come up with a more thought-out battle plan? Or maybe, allude to the fact they they did have many potential plans that were discarded as new information presented itself? It just kind of seemed like they just charged in knowing they were outgunned by friends and foes as well as the fact betrayal was imminent. 

  Second, the politics of the Village Hidden in the Mist and the things they implied about your greater Naruto world was very interesting. The fact that Yagura was able to look past some of his hate for bloodlines and still use those that have some utility was much more practical than I was expecting. I also enjoyed your resolution of the required change of regime but lack of actual rebelling forces (since all the canon rebels were, well... not), particularly since it accomplishes Akatsuki's as well as Itachi's goals. Was Yagura also under a long-term Sharingan Genjutsu in this version of events?

  Third, the small details put in this chapter. Itachi being suitably terrifying and mysterious. Akatsuki using a more compact method for sealing the tailed beasts. Yagura's ruthless practically. All of these helped both satiate my thirst of ALL the details... and make it seem that there was but an ocean of them still out there. I thought that that was particularly well done.

  This chapter is one of those I wrote some time ago, and only retouched recently. It's interesting for me to see how my writing style changed, which I guess is mainly that *wow*, I used to be a lot wordier. I mean, paragraphs are NOT supposed to be half a page long, and that's *after* severe cuttage.

  Anyway, more story! Action, excitement, and villainous reveals. And of course, there's that pesky darkness technique again...

  Oh, just a quick question I forgot to ask a long time ago. Is the Sharingan going to be as ridiculously op in this as it was in the anime? Because one of the things I hated the most about the anime was how strong those eyes got, to the point where the fact that Konoha (and I don't know if this is canon or just widely repeated fanon) needed the Fourth to win the war for them makes no sense. When you have an entire clan of Uchiha, you should curb stomp any other civilization in sight. 

  But anyway, enough ranting. Are bloodlines going to be more down-to-earth in this fic, or is using and countering the crazy powerful canon abilities rationally going to be part of the fun? Because in a world where genjutsu is actually useful, I can only imagine how much stuff Sasuke could do with his eyes.

    >  Is the Sharingan going to be as ridiculously op in this as it was in the anime? 

    I can answer this one with a reassuring "Nope!" 

    There are in fact two fundamental differences between canon and NTBS, the first being heightened rationality of main characters and the second being reduced power levels. The reason for this (as you probably guessed) is that there really isn't much opportunity for rationality when you already have overwhelming power - as Kakashi keeps harping on, the best strategy is usually the simplest one, and in the case of canon Obito that would be just "teleport in and capture all the tailed beasts instantly" and in the case of canon Madara "Crush everything and everything by yourself instantly. That's no fun.

    And of course, if you put put power like that in the hands of the heroes, the result is even worse. 

    So no. No invincible Susanoo, no techniques that can destroy entire villages like Deidera and Pain, and no morphing into a gooddamn Shark and causing a Tsunami. Even the tailed beasts are hugely toned down, as you can see in this chapter, due to A) lower chakra levels and B) lack of chakra resistance which makes them weak to genjutsu and sealing. 

    >Because in a world where genjutsu is actually useful, I can only imagine how much stuff Sasuke could do with his eyes. 

    Genjutsu, on the other hand, is just as useful in this fic as you would expect it to be.
