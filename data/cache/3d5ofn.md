  This chapter felt very bitter-sweet. One last dance, before the storm.

- u/recursiveAI:
  ```
  Very nice. Really enjoying it so far (finished chapter 3)
  ```

- u/Jace_MacLeod:
  ```
  This story seems promising. Out of curiosity, is Nerra based loosely on Kreia from KOTOR II? They both have white hair, brown robes, an affinity for force sight, and a philosophy of viewing the light and dark sides of the Force as two parts of a greater whole. If Nerra starts talking in cryptic, manipulative half-truths, I'm calling shenanigans.

    ```
    Nerra backwards is Arren.  As in, "[Arren Kae](http://lparchive.org/Knights-of-the-Old-Republic-II/Update%2058/)".  ;)
    ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    More than loosely :)
    ```
