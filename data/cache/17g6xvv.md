## Why are there so many 'Best X of Y fics' posts?

This [seems](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/17fpohj/any_original_work_that_have_a_lot_of_intelligent/)  to [have](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/1771ic2/what_are_the_best_works_of_science_fiction_that/) become [a](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/175gqcv/what_are_the_best_works_of_rational_science/) trend [lately](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/174ph59/what_are_the_best_works_of_fantasy_and_science/) on [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/172ik2m/smartest_characters_in_outsmarting_outwitting/) subreddit [for](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/16w6dxk/best_works_of_science_fiction_and_fantasy_that/) some [reason](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/16rpgnw/best_deconstructions_of_the_mutant_metaphor/), to [the](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/16qccam/request_suggestions_hypercompetent_genius/) point [that](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/16on43f/best_deconstructions_of_the_world_is_not_ready/) I [had](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/17ftxnx/best_destruction_fics_of_the_free_love_future/) to keep adding words to this run-on sentence just to fit in all the embedded links.

Theoretically, this is is a subreddit for recommendations as well as discussion, but... at this point, i'm half-expecting a 'best examples of protagonist with underwater basket weaving expertise' thread. There's, what, a few dozen total stories that are widely regarded as proper rational fics? This specificity seems excessive. And a little spammy; we have a Monday Request and Recommendation Thread for a reason!

  I’m not sure why the subreddit has been getting a glut of posts about the best x of y fics, but it looks like it’s only a few users that are asking about them. I counted ~3 distinct users that have been posting these questions, and they do drive discussion, even the ones that look like obvious bait.

  Honestly I’m glad that there’s some activity on the subreddit, there’s been times where it’s a ghost town for months on end.

  I don't consider them to be overly specific, but I do agree that they'd be better in the Monday rec thread.  
  There's only a dozen or so properly rational fics, but we do tend towards just reccing a lot of things multiple degrees from that category even in the main rec thread.

    Then what else could possibly be a top level post?  I swear half the posts here are just repostings of Royal Road chapters.  There is only so much you can discuss Worm.

  I hadn't been noticing that particularly, and actually a hyper specific thread that got any actual suggestions would be very exciting for me.  Maybe finding things that fit will get people to uncover gems?

  That says less about what's out there and more about the insular tastes of this group.  There were a number of golden age sci fi writers who did much what this group says it wants that never get suggested.

  Its a lot more than a few dozen, theres, like, >100 great glowfics alone that are underdiscussed on here. Depending on how you count, and needs the usual glowfic disclaimers.

      Quote from lesswrong: 

      >This is a description for first-time glowfic readers who are unfamiliar with the format.

      >A glowfic is a fictional story written by multiple authors who roleplay as the characters. A typical glowfic will appear on glowfic.com and looks like an internet forum where fictional people will post comments back and forth which end up telling a story. To read it, just start at the top and read each comment, just like a regular comment thread. Each comment usually includes a photo of the character to convey their facial expression, dress, or other details. For more information, see the community guide to glowfic.

      Heres a short quiz to guide you to a glowfic you might like:

      I personally am a fan of the character Tarinda, heres a relatively short, finished story with her: https://glowfic.com/posts/5474

      A standard glowfic disclaimer goes something like this: "glowfics are often unfinished, meandering/plotless, full of emotional discourse or philosophical discourse. Sometimes 2-4 layers of recursion deep, so if you don't get something you might be in a recursive layer and need to read a base story first".

        I've seen glowfic recommendations before. But are those stories really in the form of endless numbers of forum posts? How can anyone stand reading in a format like that? Am I missing something?

        For all I know this is the greatest story ever written, but it's literally unreadable when presented like that.

          For us fans of old layouts (haters of new web layouts) its great! 

          I believe theres a couple tools to download a work including the facial expression pics but when I looked into them I couldn't get them to work, maybe thats been improved, was a couple years ago. 

            What do you actively dislike about it? Not that it helps but I'm curious, I parse it very well, but then I've also put reddit into old/no-tumbnails mode.
