## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  ```
  [Tower of Somnus](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/36983/tower-of-somnus) by CoCop.

  The story is set in a corporate dystopia with a VRMMO added. The premise is that aliens came to Earth to invite humanity into a galactic federation, but were so disappointed by humans they instead left and put an embargo on Earth. Before they left, they gave humanity limited subscriptions into The Tower of Somnus, a VRMMO that would allow for them to improve themselves and interact with other aliens.

  The MC is a "runner" which basically entails delivering packages while running away from the cops or gangs. She manages to get a subscription into the Tower of Somnus and is one of the few people who actually meets aliens (mainly because subscriptions are hoarded by the rich who build their own team so they don't have to share), and joins an alien team to climb the Tower. She isn't OP and has to work with limited resources to survive. If she does better than other people, it's largely because she trains hard and gets advice from her alien teammates, who know about the Tower and can giver her advice other people aren't privy to.

  The worldbuilding is decent. It's split between cyberpunk (the corporate dystopia the MC lives in) and a more fantasy-ish world of the Tower. Neither are especially unique, but they're consistent and they do feel real enough and lived-in. The alien races are pretty well described, but since we only see them in the game it's a bit limited on what we learn about them.

  The writing style is pretty good. I've notice a few grammatical mistakes, but they're fairly rare and nothing major.

  If you interested in a story that mixes sci-fi and cyberpunk with fantasy and RPG mechanics, I'd recommend giving this a shot.

  [The Devil's Foundry](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/36804/the-devils-foundry) by Argentorum

  A heroine and a villainess get caught up in a transporter accident and isekaied into a fantasy world with and RPG system that likes making puns. The need to learn to survive in their new world using their new powers and whatever knowledge they know from the modern world. The heroine takes the route of a do-gooder. The villainess decides to jumpstart the industrial revolution.

  Both MCs are pretty well-written, but the story focuses on the villainess. There’s only 16 chapters so far, but we see a fair bit of their character. The heroine who goes out and tries to help people finds out >!after her first shakedown that doing good is all well and good, but in a broken system (in terms of society) it really doesn’t mean much!< Meanwhile the villainess >!sets up shop in a poor part of town. She gets some underlings, and while she isn’t a stranger to violence to achieve her goals, she starts to value and take care of “her” people.!< 

  The world is decent but fairly generic. It’s a fantasy world with monsters. Kill some and get experience points. Get XP and improve stats or get abilities.

  The writing style is pretty good. Kinda lightehearted, in a "doesn't really take anything seriously" way. I don’t remember coming across typos while reading.

  All in all it’s a pretty fun story. I’m a fan of pragmatic MCs who know how to take stock of what’s around them, set goals that aren’t ridiculous, and use brain instead of brawn, which is where the story really shines.

  Does anyone have a link to / remember the name of that short story (it's based on a tumblr writing prompt) where a high school girl juggles a massive number of different supernatural lovers, beginning with the classic vampire and werewolf but also including an angel, demon, pirate, catboy, assassin, wizard, and superintelligence?

    I'm pretty sure it was a Facebook post by Yudkowsky, I've found a line that seems to refer to it:

    "You know that hoary old plot, "The elegant vampire, the strong werewolf, and the woman who just can't make up her mind"? I think those stories should just keep going: Introduce the secretive wizard, the innocent catboy, the stonehearted assassin, the shy half-demon, the pirate, the ninja... This is *almost* the plot of the Anita Blake novels but for some reason Laurell K. Hamilton just sticks to adding more and more lycanthropes and undead to the harem instead of branching out."

    It's from https://github.com/algroznykh/lw-bot/blob/master/data/fb.txt which seems to be various bits of text mined from the LW sphere on Facebook, but I've had no luck searching for that further.

  While content starved, I searched WormStorySearch a bunch but found the ratings had an inconsistent relationship with story quality. Searching /r/WormFanfic I found the following thread, about a year old, which seems like a better metric:

    I just go down the list at SV and SB. Most of them are bad but some are decent. None of them I would recommend here as the ones I like are crack and satirical. Nothing rational or realistic takes on the work.

    They also have a tendency to die within a month. But that's life reading fanfics. Assume all fics are dead and every time an author posts, it's a pleasant surprise.

    Not really a recommendation but the otherwise typical battle shonen One Piece has an interesting ranking system where most of the main characters are wanted pirates and the monetary amount of their bounty works as a way to track their power level.
    ```

    - u/aponty:
      ```
      Is that where Lord of the Mysteries (also not something I recommend) got that bounty ranking system?  I couldn't get into One Piece but I suspect that's a much wider trope actually.
      ```

      - u/Hypervisor:
        ```
        Never read Lord of Mysteries but considering that One Piece has been active and popular for more than 20 years that's probably the source.

        - u/aponty:
          ```
          One Piece clearly outdates a lot of works, but that doesn't necessarily mean it is the progenitor of the trope

          It probably did inspire later instances ofc

  I am looking for stories that have the protagonist end up competent but not op.  

  To describe it using a metaphor, in some rpg games, you level up your character enough and you'll obliterate most anything low level with little to no effort.  I don't want to read stories that have protagonists progress to that level of power.

  Instead, I would want them to have Witcher/Dark souls levels of power: you get ultra skilled yes, but even the lowest level creature will murder the crap out of you if you aren't careful, even at higher levels.  I put down the Witcher 3 some time ago after gaining quite some proficieny and when I picked it up again, and I find myself dying in comparatively low-level encounters.  That's what I want to see in progression for protagonists.  

  Gilded Hero is a good example.

  I was recently gifted a Kindle. Along with kindle unlimited, any recommendations to read on there? Or how to make the best use of it?
  ```

  - u/DangerouslyUnstable:
    ```
    I had Kindle Unlimited for a while. The quality-to-garbage ratio is unfortunately really really low. So if you have some way of searching through it, it can be really great. I found enough good stuff to last me a few months, and then was unable to find more. Not that there wasn't more stuff worth reading out there, I just couldn't find it. I believe the entire Cradle series is on KU, which is very popular on this sub, so I'd recommend starting with that. The author has a couple other series as well that seem well received, but I never got into them.

    In my personal experience, unless you like trashy harem romances (no judgement), you'll probably get at most a month or two of value out of KU, then I'd cancel it. If you _do_ like trashy harem romances, well then you are in luck. You will literally never run out of material. I'm pretty sure that books in that genre are being written faster than you could read them, even if it's all you read. 

    Other than that, I use Kindle as my primary novel reading format these days. If I want to read it, I usually get it on Kindle, both because it's usually cheaper and a lot more convenient to carry around. 

    Also, if you have a library card, I'm pretty sure that overdrive and other library ebook checkout apps will allow you to download to your kindle.

    I personally also don't have an ethical problem with downloading ebook versions of books that I have a physical copy of (either bought in the pre-ebook era or have been gifted), but that's up to you and your personal ethical beliefs I guess.

      Part of me wants to response with "Challenge accepted!" but I would have to reduce the number of web serials that I read in order to truly accept it.

      - u/Dragongeek:
        ```
        Even mediocre authors on Kindle Unlimited can make a respectable of money if they can write decent smut/romance, it pays well:

        KU pays authors ~$0.005 per page read, so a 60,000 word novel comes out to ~$1 per person who reads (or pages through!) the whole thing. A decent author puts down, say, 1000 words per hour. This means, to meet a $10/hr wage and "break even", only 600 people need to read your novel cover to cover and after that it's pure profit forever since the novel is already written. Add that to the fact that a dedicated reader can chew through that in an afternoon and that series can have very high retention if written with proper cliffhangers and you have a good recipe for making money.
        ```

      - u/ahasuerus_isfdb:
        ```
        > Are there really that many?

        "Harem" and "reverse harem" fantasy/science fiction books have been very popular lately. An Amazon Kindle search on "reverse harem" finds over 10,000 matches. Spot-checking suggests that roughly half of them have SF/F elements. A quick check of the ISFDB robot's internal database finds over 4,700 books with the word "harem" in the title, including over 2,500 "reverse harem" titles. And that's just the stuff that *hasn't* been added to the main ISFDB database (yet).

            It's really odd, a few of the older ones have a spark of creativity, and the interconnected Universe of [Otherlife](https://www.amazon.com/Otherlife-Omnibus-Selfless-Trilogy-Books-ebook/dp/B01N23IB1P) and the other books by the same author were alright for $0.99 at the start. 

            I've since dropped the series which is a shame, it had a fairly interesting meta-story across all of the different characters worlds with hints towards the larger conflict only resolving if everything was put together. 

            Each one is the same formula. Protagonist gets power, protagonist (sometimes) protests about the ethics of collecting a harem and perhaps even killing if the world isn't set up to accept killing as a daily thing. Protagonist gets over reservations, gets harem, hint about the Runner Norwood conflict, protagonist kills a bunch of people and perhaps takes some women as conquest, who are not slaves? Somehow. 

            Drop the harem aspect, combine a bunch of the harem characters into one or two to get the correct story beats, and have emotional bonding actually take time, leave the meta-story in place and it would actually be pretty good. I was really hoping the author would break from the formula once the worlds started crossing over, but nope. So dropped it. 

            Keep in mind this is one of the better authors for the genre. It's making money so I can't really fault it, but it's pulp fiction.

              ```
              I have been considering if writing a story about a romance with a shapeshifter might scratch the same preference for variety without attempting to give depth to an impossible number of romances.

               The numbers game is inherently the problem. The graph of relationships that matter go up exponentially with the number of people involved, and this becomes unmanageable  beyond 3 people - I have read a fair few good triad romances, and heck, many harems are also good.. until girl number 3 shows up, and the author just gives up on having the members of the harem interact with one another, and things get puddle shallow. 

              OT3s can have all the relationships be meaningful, if the book is not overly short. Beyond that, it just does not work.
              ```

              - u/Weerdo5255:
                ```
                I'd have to agree the only place I've seen something beyond an OT3 work has been in some Harry Potter Fanfics where the characters are already well established, and even then I wouldn't call it very good. I'm drawing a blank on the name at the moment, and their are likely a few examples given the pervasiveness of the trope in the fandom. 

                In any case, the best examples of things near the harem trope I've seen have been a relationship between two characters with a lot of close friendships that never go beyond that. You could conceivably just change a few things to have that be a Harem, but then the authors doing the work for that kind of interpersonal dynamics don't go beyond the traditional relationships. Writing a romance that's good between even two characters is difficult beyond that... 

                Hmm, I might plug that into the requests next Monday, good Harem story's with emotional development. Rational on top of that might be too narrow. I'd be interested to see it.
                ```

                - u/Izeinwinter:
                  ```
                  The reason you can attach a fair number of significant friends to a romance without running into the same problem is that the relationship between Eves mentor and Sams childhood friend is not important, and can be left out without that being a glaring omission, or included as space permits.

                  But every edge on the graph of relationships in a poly cluster matters. (even if it is a very unequal one where people only sleep with the protagonist) If Bob, Eva and River are all sleeping with Denver, it is going to seem odd if Bob has no opinions on Eva and River

                  In a threesome, no problem, 3 bi directional edges, you can explore that without writing the lord of the rings. 4, it is 8. which is "wrist breaking tome" territory.
                  ```

      - u/DangerouslyUnstable:
        ```
        That was mostly hyperbole, but it certainly seems that way? I haven't explored enough to be sure. Perhaps not if you constrain to harem novels specifically, but trashy romance novels in general, almost certainly. I got a couple KU-available recommendations from this sub that turned out to be relatively sex-heavy, and my Kindle recommendations very rapidly populated with more of the same, which led me to believe that there was lots out there.
        ```

        - u/PastafarianGames:
          ```
          Fascinating. Kindle recommendations mostly just throw milSF at me, despite the fact that I probably read more (fantasy/paranormal) romance novels than MilSF (especially if we count stuff like Seanan McGuire's InCrypted series as romance). Maybe it's because I've been reading MilSF on Kindle for longer?
          ```

  - u/chiruochiba:

    I also had Kindle Unlimited for a while. I concur that the quality to chaff ratio if pretty terrible, and Amazon's interface makes it near impossible to find things that would fit the user's preferences.  I gave up on Kindle Unlimited when I realized that fanfiction websites such as fanfiction.net and archiveofourown.org had a much better selection of amateur works - for free.

    That said, I did find a few series on Kindle Unlimited that were worthwhile. For example, Edward W. Robertson's fantasy series are all pretty great (i.e. [The Cycle of Arawn](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NS88E3G/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_hsch_vapi_tkin_p1_i6)  and its sequels). Not necessarily rational, but a very enjoyable read nonetheless.

    I also thoroughly enjoyed [Icon-Violet](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01LY1S4O0/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_hsch_vapi_tkin_p1_i0), which is a dystopian scifi story that examines interesting concepts related to AI, ethics, and problems of personal identity. I think it would appeal to people on this sub who like Greg Egan's novels.

    ```
    One of my all-time favorite series, [Cradle](https://www.amazon.com/Unsouled-Cradle-Book-Will-Wight-ebook/dp/B01H1CYBS6), is on Kindle Unlimited. It's a progression fantasy where the main character basically spends his time learning magic martial arts, despite starting out crippled. There's lots of slow-burn character development and some damn impressive foreshadowing at times (it was just revealed that certain details from book freaking 1 were foreshadowing twists all the way in book 8).

    If you try it, I'd recommend reading at least halfway through book 1 (Unsouled).

  Not rational(ist), but adjacent to topics relevant to the interests of the sub (being centred around the idea of ubiquitous memory/personality uploads and modification). **[Kaiba](https://myanimelist.net/anime/3701/Kaiba)** is a great artsy anime. A plot summary:

  > In a world where memories exist in memory chips separate from the body, death of the body no longer means death of the soul. It is possible for memories to be viewed, altered, and transferred between bodies. These memory chips are used by the rich to obtain eternal lives in carefully selected bodies, while for the poor, selling their own bodies and conserving their souls in the chips often become the only way to earn a living. An electrolytic cloud in the sky serves as a barrier between the heavens of the fortunate and the underworld of the destitute, making this social division impregnable.

  > One day, a man named Kaiba wakes up in an empty room with no memories, a mysterious hole in his chest, and a locket holding the picture of an unknown woman. After escaping an attack and stumbling upon a decrepit village of underworld residents, he begins his adventure across the different planets of this strange universe to find out more about his own identity and the woman he once knew.

    Seconding Kaiba. The art style is unique in a not-always-good way, but it also makes for some fluid 3d-esque animation at times, and quirky and recognisable characters. But it's the deeply transhumaist and emotion-infused story that tops the rec reasons.

    Reverend Insanity fits all of your requirements. 

    Wuxia cultivation story with an irredeemably evil MC (acts like HPMOR Voldemort to a tee, immortality is his sole goal). Premise is that he transmigrates from Earth, slowly and painfully cultivates to a high level, then manages to reincarnate just before he's killed by everyone he pissed off. Armed with foreknowledge and centuries of experience, he uses a genuinely weak starting hand to progress faster than in his previous life. People look down on him because of his weak aptitude, he has little money and no friends or trustworthy family.

    No idiot ball, everyone's scheming. The intellectual agility of it is impressive: even I miss some of the traps they lay for eachother. If something seems odd, it's probably because there's something yet to be revealed.

    Also, it's incredibly long. 2000+ chapters and many millions of words. Downsides are that it can get hard to remember all the characters because the Chinese names blur (at least for me). The translation can also get slightly unwieldy at times.
    ```

    - u/incamaDaddy:
      ```
      gonna check it out, my main problem with xianxia and wuxia is that I'm not a native English speaker, so because I had to learn English as a second language I'm very big on proper grammar and sentence structure, which tends to be sadly lacking in Chinese translations, because I'm afraid of picking up bad habits.
      ```

      - u/alphanumericsprawl:
        ```
        The grammar is fine, it's just that the actual sentences themselves sound off.

        >“But the thing I am even more happy about is obtaining over two hundred thousand terror claw horses. With these horses, uncle can greatly raise his horse group’s scale and increase my Ma tribe’s supreme might in the coming heroes assembly!”

        It *sounds* weird because they're translating. Supreme might is probably a word in Chinese, just doesn't transfer so well.

    Have you read Ar'Kendrythist? It's a long one, and imo really good one. It's pretty divisive here though.

    Savage Divinity is another long one, but not so good one. Like a sine wave of bad and good storytelling, but really long, like 2 million words so far.

    I've heard good things about The Power Of Ten: Sama Rantha.

    Zombie Knight Saga is really good if you haven't read it. 

    Honestly there aren't many good progression fantasies that are longer than 300k words that also aren't popular. Here's a few more stories that aren't strictly progression fantasy:

    The Demon Lord's Lover is really sweet romance. Think generic isekai world. The mentor of the last generation of heroes falls in love with the demon lord. The worldbuilding and magic is surprisingly good too, and pretty deep.

    The Featherlight Transmission is a far future biopunk dystopic murder mystery, with a snarky protagonist like in Dresden Files (but less annoying imo). That should tell you enough. It lives up to expectations too.

      > I've heard good things about The Power Of Ten: Sama Rantha.

      Sama Rantha *sounds* good, but in execution it's incredibly irritating and annoying. 

      Like, the idea of a tabletop munchkin - someone who lives and breathes broken character builds - getting isekai'd into their game of choice, and suddenly being able to put those broken builds into practice would be amazing if done well. 

      But it's not. The TTRPG system in Sama Rantha appears to be some heavily customized version of D&D 3.5, to the point where it's basically unrecognizable. 

      Which is fine for a normal story (see Metaworld Chronicles), but with a story about munchkinry it's the first unforgivable mistake the author makes. 

      See, the fun of a story about build munchkinry is that *you can follow along*. If you're familiar with the system and have access to some of the materials, you too can look up the broken build the author's come up with so far and marvel at it. With a heavily customized system like in Sama Rantha, it just feels like the author is pulling things out their ass. It's totally unclear what rules they're actually adhering to, which makes the munchkin part of the story feel terrible.

      The next mistake is with the homebrewed system itself. The fun of munchkining something is directly related to the difficulty of, you know, character optimization. What crazy nonsense do you have to pull to get a normal PC [the beholder mage class?](http://dictummortuum.blogspot.com/2011/12/lordofprocrastinations-dirty-tricks.html) What weird contortions do you have to pull to get a Wizard with a starting age of 16? 

      In Sama Ratha, *the system is trivial to optimize*. For some godforsaken reason the homebrew DM has decided to allow characters to, upon gaining a level, choose to instead *gestalt in a new class*. If you're unaware of the gestalt mechanics in D&D 3.5, they effectively let you gain (say) level 1 in both Fighter and Rogue **at the same time**, taking the attributes of *both* classes, and picking the better of the two where they conflict (e.g, hit points). 

      The gestalt mechanics are explicitly noted as being overpowered in the chapter that introduces them, and are suggested only for high-power level games. Not only that, but this homebrewed mechanic makes them _even more powerful_, because it allows you to arbitrarily gestalt _every_ class onto your base class (the standard gestalt rules only let you pick two classes to combine per level, and three is right out)

      This means that there's basically zero work that goes in to optimizing a character in the Sama Rantha system. You don't have to choose anything. You can just take everything. 

      There is a (very minor) limit to this - the game seems to be running on an E6 variant, except in this case it's more like E10. For the uninitiated, D&D eventually goes from "adventuring party fighting against evil" to "optimized magic users kill everything before it can see them". E6 caps character progression at level 6, which is about when fighters are kinda powerful (it's when they get the Leadership feat, and can have a squad of followers) and magic users aren't totally overpowered (they don't have their key "I win" spells yet). E10 would exist in a really awkward spot, where magic users are dominating encounters and fighters are just kinda there. 

      The last mistake the author makes is "then" / "than" confusion. I don't think there was a single correct usage of then or than in the chapters I read. It was infuriating.

  Any stories with interesting Magitech settings ? Meaning worlds where there's technology but it's magic based, could be more or less advanced than our own, I'm looking for well done examples of it.

    Game Theory and its sequel Power Games have some really good magitech IMO. They're Nanoha fanfics, but should be reasonably understandable without the source material (though looking up pictures of the characters could be useful). It should be noted that Nanoha itself is a pretty good magitech series itself, though to a lesser degree.

    Here's the [A03 series page](https://archiveofourown.org/series/71228), but there's a ton of background worldbuilding explanations that are collected on the forum [here](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/power-games-nanoha-fanfic.1294/).

    I'll just leave the TvTropes' quote from the author here:

    >Oh, Gamesverse. So many collapses. They're standing on the shoulders of so many giants that their heads are brushing the upper atmosphere. Or would be, had most of the giants not tripped one another up, stabbed each other in the kidney and generally fallen over in various different ways, in ages past. So what they're really standing on is a pile of giants' skeletons, some of which have still-spiky bits of ribcage and femur sticking out to gore whoever's currently on top in the ankle.

    >... basically, the Gamesverse has a history of collapses for a very good reason. Which can roughly be summed up with the word "mages".

    >— Aleph

    A kinda neat one IMO is [World of Cultivation](https://dreamsofjianghu.ca/%E4%BF%AE%E7%9C%9F%E4%B8%96%E7%95%8C-world-of-cultivation/table-of-contents/), which doesn't really have "magitech" so much as it has "xianxia-tech". 

    It's built in to the world, too - for example, the standard xianxia trope of sound transmission tablets have been turned into a public radio service you can tune in to by running your Qi (termed "lianqi" in the translation) through the appropriate talisman. 

    Later on, there's even a xianxia-tech MMO that's been running for thousands of years. 

    The main downside is that, like I said the last time I recommended it, the translation tends to be very "keikaku means plan" - there's perfectly serviceable translations for a lot of the things the translator leaves untranslated, though you can get used to it if you persist.

  Looking for self inserts that focus on surviving the setting they are put in rather than a slice of life/harem/fix-it. Worm is probably the only setting where fix-it is acceptable since the sword of Damocles is hanging over your head so you could not stand idle.[Adversary](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/adversary-oc-si.798962/page-2) can come off as cringe or edgy to others but I find it very realistic and unique.

    Sleeping with the Girls ([Vol. 1](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5792734/1/Sleeping-with-the-Girls-Vol-I-Fictional-Reality), [Vol. 2](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6052381/1/Sleeping-With-The-Girls-Vol-II-Chaos-Theory)) is a very solid instance of this. It takes a premise which seems tailor-made for harem shenanigans (self-insert appears in the bed of a different one of his favorite anime characters each time he goes to sleep), but manages to turn it into a survival-focused story instead through the power of Thinking Through The Implications. Elaboration below, if you're okay with the spoileriness inherent in said elaboration.

    >!He keeps on being physically threatened due to the characters in question and those around him very reasonably interpreting his appearance as a result of deliberate action rather than involuntary sleep-teleportation, and the characters doing the threatening are often violence-inclined or Ridiculously Overpowered or both. He keeps on ending up in particularly-lethal anime settings where normal squishy humans are at high risk of being killed. And his favorite characters are generally tsunderes, and sometimes villains, which makes both of the aforementioned factors a whole lot more dangerous.!<

    >!(And there aren't any particular harem activities, either, aside from those already present in the canons he visits. Or any main-character-centric romance at all, as far as I recall from last time I read it through (which was admittedly a while ago). Which makes sense, given that he's only able to be in a given world for a few days at most before falling asleep and getting yoinked elsewhere, and that's not really much time for relationship-building.)!<

  It's been a long while since I've recommended anything here. The quality of what I read has slowly edged to a cliff and fallen off.

  However, there still are good stories out there. Here's one that I'm happy to share.

  [Dogs of War (Completed)](https://archiveofourown.org/works/16304576/chapters/38136218)

  Fullmetal Alchemist, Roy Mustang, and co along with an army are called to duty for a war none of them wanted.

  A bit of spoilers follow. However, if you read this it becomes fairly obvious far before it occurs.

  >!No fuckery with Truth or even focus on alchemy. It's there alchemy and transmutation of the environment yes but it rather used like a tool. Instead, it explores how fast can responsiblity and its consequences age boys into men and beyond. There is no happy ending all around.!<

    There's a [podcast discussion](https://www.doofmedia.com/2020/06/19/doofcast-86-17776/) about the story which helped me understand it a great deal better than I did on my own.

    ```

    - u/ironistkraken:
      ```
      So if you look at fiction thats taught in school, you can find things about those books that you can argue the author believes about real life.   So when reading Charles Dicken's Great Expectations you can argue that Charles Dickens believes that the best way to be happy is to get along with family and friends.   Wildbow's works (thinking of worm and ward here) had alot to do say about trauma and overcoming it.   I really enjoyed this aspect of the work in that had a deeper meaning.  PGTE and the wandering inn while really interesting have much weaker themes, with PGTE's metaness undercutting them and the wandering inn is more like popcorn then real food.  I wanted to know if there are other web based serials out there that have strong themes like worm and ward.

        You might want to start branching out into published lit if this drew you to Worm, etc. I'd say Joe Abercrombie's books tend to revolve arounda theme and have something to say about it, and they're pretty entertaining. I say to start with Best Served Cold, a standalone novel, and give it a full three chapters or so as the first chapter and change are a little slow. You'll know when you hit the part that isn't slow :0

    [God of Eyes](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26818/god-of-eyes) has an atheist reincarnate into a local god in another world, and he slowly comes to grips with his godliness and purpose. I thought the beginning was great, but the ending slowed down a lot.

    [Purple Days] (https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/purple-days-asoiaf-joffrey-timeloop-au.450894/) is a Joffrey time loop fanfic. What I really liked was the exploration of the world rather than focusing on Solving The Conflict. Joffrey gets exposed to many walks of life as he explores the world of GoT in his loops, with each journey teaching him different things. Less focused on the human experience imo, but enjoyable nonetheless. 

    Maybe Worth the Candle too now that I think about it, although you might have already read that. It's very popular in this subreddit.

    I counter the rec for Mayor of Noobtown. The first book has promise, but every subsequent book becomes more and more centered around puerile potty humor, culminating in the fourth book, where where the author feels the need to make the MC appear to all his followers as a tiny dick impotent premature ejaculator who rubs gallons of medicine every night on his little floppy worm. 

    Take a 10 year old's conception of humor, dial it up to eleven, **make it integral to the plot**, and that's this series in a **nut**shell(heh).
