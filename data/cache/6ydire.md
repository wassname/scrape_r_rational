  Replacing Rise is going to be a real problem.  Cat gets nearly killed often enough that she's REALLY going to miss being able to heal.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    I mean she fractured her rib seconds after 
    swapping powers. I do wonder what she'll Take next and how often she can Take. It's interesting we've only seen it used a couple of times.
    ```

    - u/CFCrispyBacon:
      ```
      It seems like she can only Take one power at a time, and that only lasts until she Takes something else.  Extremely powerful, but a mixed bag.  Using it offensively here was a good idea, but she'll probably Take the next thing that comes along that is more advantageous, and doesn't clash with her Winter title.
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        Crazy thought, what if she Takes an aspect from [Ranger](https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2017/01/04/regard/). Learn, Perfect, or Transcend I think Cat takes the last.
        ```

        - u/CFCrispyBacon:
          ```
          Maybe eventually?  I wouldn't want to mess with any of the Calamities, especially the one that I'd have to first pick a fight with (thus being on the losing side of the story arc from the beginning), who is also the one who hunts fae nobles for sport.
          ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Time to find a real healer
    ```

    - u/Kiroto:
      ```
      Just need a quick detour down to the free cities to meet the Irene (Ashen Priestess) about a thing, brb Diabolist.
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        I know it's near impossible but if Cat managed to indoctrinate the white knight and Co I would be so happy.

        Maybe the  fact that the dread empress let diabolist use the weapon would push cat to the other side.
        ```

        - u/Belgarion262:
          ```
          It would be interesting to see some "Good Guys" who would be flexible enough to try and work towards something different, a little like Black and the Empress have done, but from the "Good" perspective (if that makes sense).
          ```

          - u/None:
            ```
            Yeah, since I learned about the empire that is ruled by a hero and a villain duo, I have been waiting for a hero to join cat on equal grounds
            ```

- u/aeschenkarnos:
  ```
  These chapters are coming amazingly fast!
  ```

  - u/Belgarion262:
    ```
    If I recall correctly, they are released Monday and Wednesday.


    In fact


    As quoted from the wordpress site; "Updates every Monday and Wednesday, as of the latest Patreon goal."

    &nbsp;

    And I agree! It is a pleasantly rapidly updated story, especially when compared to others on the web.
    ```

- u/MoralRelativity:
  ```
  Cat's taken a beating but it seemed to be a worthwhile exchange. Masego and Archer are both going to be useful.

  Predictions for next chapter:

  1. Juniper will make an impact.

  2. The knights will make more of an impact.

  3. Summer will finish with Winter.
  ```

- u/None:
  ```
  This was a insanely good chapter, I knew that rise would be run off / be replaced sooner or later but this this bet from Cat was on Joseph Joestar level, I really like it a lot.
  ```
