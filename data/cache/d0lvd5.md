## [RT][HF][FF] Left Beyond Quest II: Stopping God and saving humanity in the Left Behind universe

### Post:

Hi!

Since someone made a Left Beyond post a while ago, I'd like to note that the quest is getting a prequel!

This time, the players are workers in the Antichrist's phone company (which is staffed by mysteriously hypercompetent people) in the setting of the Left Behind novels. Their stated goal is making sure that despite seven years of Biblical plagues, the nominal heroes still have access to the internet. Their actual goal is to cancel the Apocalypse.

You may be familiar with Fred Clark's deconstruction of the Left Behind novels.

  Do I need to read the previous quest for this to make sense?

    Not at all. In fact, the previous quest assumes that the current quest fails (Which doesn't mean it's doomed to fail, of course, it's like the XCOM games)

      Thanks!

      > it's like the XCOM games

      That is a very apt description, considering how the dice seemed to always go in the first quest. It was still a fun rabbit hole to go down, though.

  I read part way through the first quest, but got stuck and stopped when they insisted on solving social issues while a literal apocalypse was approaching. Without spoiling anything else, do they get stuck on social issues this time as well?
  ```

  - u/spiritplumber:
    ```
    This time they seem more keen on promoting tribal warfare in Africa and conducting midnight raids, although they've also stopped a train robbery and rescued a bunch of refugees.

    In the first quest, the Omega are an amoral swarm of quasi-AI: if they solved social issues, it was for the intended purpose of gaining allies to deal with said apocalypse. Over the years they ended up allying with a LGBT group, a bunch of anarcho-capitalists, people who are in favor of cryptocurrency, people who are against cryptocurrency, Ancient Egyptian revivalists, drug dealers, and more. Skip ahead a few years/turns and see what bonuses and penalties their attempt to shape society  resulted in :)

    In the current quest, the Foreman is a regular human being, and will do what his morality or lack thereof (as decided by the players) calls for. A few people will be able to "see through" to the Foreman's karma, either because they have that supernatural gift and the Foreman hasn't figured out how to block it or because they are trained in psychology and investigative techniques, but most will go by his reputation (which has a lot more to do with PR effort than any actual heroic or villainous deeds).
    ```
