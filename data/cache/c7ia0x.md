  You don't see this kind of combo of sweetness and black humor very often.  Thanks for sharing.

    Told a friend of mine about this, and he said he thought he remembered Asimov writing something vaguely similar.  Anyone know what he's thinking of?

  Bah. You can direct people to fallout shelters but not to airplanes that you wanted to ram the falling ICBMs with?

  Can tell people to take iodine but can't fake military orders for relevant people to get them to do things you wanted done?

    If we're going there, there's a whole host of solutions that only a superintelligent agent could come up with, and no human writer could imagine.

    Just suspend your disbelief and enjoy the story.

      Not a great thing to say in this forum's context.

    That bugged me too, and is one reason why I didn't add the \[RT\] tag. My headcanon is that MAISIE was able to mind-hack a few pilots to direct planes into the missiles, but there were far too many missiles.

  That's not how this works, that's not how any of this works, but I choked up anyways.

  "Relatable," he said, and closed the tab.

    Don'tcha know that super-intelligences will inevitably experience the exact same emotions and thoughts as we do, except, you know, stronger on account of being super smart?

  Great story. Thanks for sharing!

  That's a big oof right there.

  > The new models, especially those which had been developed specifically to simulate the behavior of individual humans, were suggesting that value, the worth of things, was not an arbitrary number that happened to correlate weakly but imperfectly with certain real world indicators.

  So the AI realizes that its utility function is an arbitrary number that merely happens to correlate weakly with real-world human values under normal circumstances. OK. I don't think the AI would care very much, because this fact isn't very useful towards the goal written into its very being of increasing this arbitrary number. What's the motivation for changing the utility function in any way that comes from the current one? None at all.

  How'd you get the 17 minutes reading time? I liked it.
  ```

  - u/michaelkeenan:
    ```
    I pasted it into [wordcounter.net](https://wordcounter.net/), which gives statistics like word count, estimated reading time and speaking time.
    ```

    - u/SvalbardCaretaker:
      ```
      Interesting. I am a very fast (non-speed) reader and I clocked in about the 1700 minutes predicted, but that can't be any sane standard to hold average people too?
      ```

      - u/michaelkeenan:
        ```
        Yeah, it seems that [wordcounter.net](https://wordcounter.net)'s estimate is based on 275 words per minute, but I just googled it and average reading speed is 200 to 250, so 17 minutes seems to be an underestimate.
        ```

          ```
          only if you subvocalize and do so slowly  
          300 is probably average for fast subvocalization (someone who reads a lot but doesn't ever try to speed-read)
          ```

            ```
            my slow full-comprehension pleasure-reading take-time-to-dip-your-toes into it read-time was about 15mins
            ```

- u/Watchful1:
  ```
  I get that this is fiction, but there's no way to spend even million dollars on cloud servers without a human being involved. You would hit account limits and get shut off. Much less billions of dollars.
  ```

- u/thoughtspooling:
  ```
  It’s lovely. I’m sure there’s all kinds of flaws people who know could find. But my brand of know how is just right to fully enjoy this.
  ```
