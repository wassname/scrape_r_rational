## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  This will be a bit of an offbeat recommendation, but I'm going to recommend this [100W LED lightbulb](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B081NT19RT?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2_dt_b_product_details) (or any other, similarly powerful bulb). When the pandemic started, I was using an ordinary 9 watt LED bulb in my light (aka a 60W "equivalent" bulb). I eventually got fed up with being constantly in the dark, because my apartment's living room window doesn't illuminate much since I'm at ground level and constantly in the shade of other buildings, so I experimented with adding a [light therapy lamp](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07VTV6GG4/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) (OK), [sunlight alarm clock](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07Q8TXXYH/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) (utterly useless), and replacing my bulb with a [22W LED \(150-200W equivalent\)](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B0817M5RGM/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) (pretty good). And yet, still found myself displeased at having insufficient amounts of light. The 100W bulb fixed that. While it did indeed fit into a standard light bulb socket, it looked utterly disproportionate and beyond ridiculous sticking out of my standing lamp. I found I didn't care at all. Every time I turn it on, I have a 'let there be light' moment. I've gotten multiple comments at how ridiculously overkill it is. I can't look at it directly without it burning my retinas. In short, it's exactly as bright as I wanted.

  I won't make any claims about increased productivity or it being useful for light therapy, but I very much appreciate no longer working in the gloom.

    I'll second that recommendation.  I got a pair of [8000 lumen LED bulbs](https://www.costco.ca/luminus-multipurpose-led-80-w-8000-lumens.product.100672817.html), and my room is much brighter and more pleasant now.  I was *badly* undershooting the [recommended lumens per square foot](https://www.homedepot.com/c/ab/lumens-per-square-foot/9ba683603be9fa5395fab90379f1638), and now I'm within the proper range.
    ```

  - u/Tenoke:
    ```
    I recently switched to a 20W LED (160W equivalent) and it's pretty nice but I have a big room and live with curtains closed. For people who don't the extra light at the evening might reduce quality of sleep (which was my main concern). 5 times stronger would I think definitely be too much for me at night.
    ```

    - u/GaBeRockKing:
      ```
      That's the beauty of it-- the light stays on during the 'day', but I switch to a much weaker light at night, basically forcing my circadian rhythm to serve my schedule.
      ```

  - u/Parada484:
    ```
    This... .. Is the most day to day useful thing that I never expected. I've got a dark room with one light bulb switch and I'm hoping this takes it from prison room feel to showroom status. TTHANK YOU!

  I read *Wanderer Above the Sea of Fog* by Mike Futcher last night after coming across [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/oqto9y/wanderer_above_the_sea_of_fog_my_own_story_free/) thread. It's a 12,000-word novelette (took me ~2 hours to finish) that features "The Galilean" as its main character. 

  The Galilean is a man who was enhanced with nanotechnology to be able to survive in extreme environments. He, and others like him, were sent across the solar system to explore different planets/moons. He currently on Europa (orbiting Jupiter), and has been hired to help a party of normal humans trek across the ice plain of the moon to a mining site.

  The story focuses on inner dialogue, and compares how the people in the Galilean's party view their guide vs what he's actually thinking. It's very introspective, and focuses on transhumanism, what it means to be human and more than human, what he's gained vs what he's left behind, and what his place in society is.

  The writing/prose is one of the strong parts of the story, and is definitely a cut above other stories I've read.

  *Wanderer Above the Sea of Fog* is currently free (Monday only) on Amazon, I'd recommend picking it up and giving it a read.

  I've got a strong recommendation for the wiki: [Nyssa in the Realm of Possibility](http://nyssa.elcenia.com/) by Alicorn. It's basically rational Alice in Wonderland. Has a similar "rational polemic" tone (for lack of a better phrase) as HPMoR. It's unabashedly rational despite it's surrealist setting.

  Also recommending Sprague Grundy's [Two Games](https://sprague-grundy.github.io/two_games/) as something in a similar vein (but different direction) as [For the Taking](https://archiveofourown.org/works/9809486) by lintamande. Both are basically about trying to deal with demons safely, and discuss sensible precautions.
  ```

  - u/lecupra:
    ```
    If you enjoyed *Nyssa in the Realm of Possibility*, [Lauren Ipsum](http://carlos.bueno.org/2011/09/ipsum.html) by Carlos Bueno is to computer science what *Nyssa* is to math (though not leaning as hard into surrealism).

  ```
  I don't know if this is the right place for this, but I wanted to thank this sub for its support over the weekend. I ran a free promotion on my ebook and I got a very positive response here.

  The story was downloaded about 200 times and made it to the #1 and #3 spot on a few of Amazon's sub-genre bestseller lists. Commenters on my post were supportive and I got a couple of glowing reviews on Amazon (I know at least one of these came from this sub). Even a one-star rating I received from somewhere (no review, perhaps a troll) hasn't soured the good experience.

  I know self-promotion is often unwelcome on Reddit, and that some self-promoters just spam sales links, but I appreciate all those who read it, and those who have reviewed it or are planning to. Self-published writing is usually a lonely and futile experience, and I'm very grateful that over the last few days this has been otherwise.

      I'm afraid not, you must have me mistaken with somebody else.

      The first part of my username is based on my hometown here in the UK, and the second part on my writing status - 'samizdat' literally means 'self-publishing', though it is usually associated with Soviet dissidents. I'm no Soviet dissident, obviously - I was just going for alliteration.

  I'm looking for movie recommendations in which the plot and characters make sense. It can be sci-fi or fantasy but it doesn't have to be. Something like Linklater's movies where real(ish) people have romances or do real stuff are also good enough.

  I can, in general, recommend one-set movies for often being so character and dialogue-driven that they are often sensible - Rope, Tape, The Man From Earth, 12 Angry Men, Sleuth, Locke etc.
  ```

    ```

    - u/Tenoke:
      ```
      I just watched it and I see why you recommend it here! The characters were realistic, the protagonist reasonable and practical, and there were no real plotholes >!except for minor nitpicks like him building the shelter in a way where a clearly important part is inaccessible to him but has had both girls there and the aliens getting so far but being so defeatable but I wouldn't count that!<

      My only real problem is that now I'm really not sure whether to try the third one in the 'trilogy'.
      ```

      - u/JanDis42:
        ```
        The third Cloverfield movie is *extremely* bad.

        Iirc, it wasn't even supposed to be a Cloverfield movie, instead being some sort of generic sci-fi horror, where they slapped on some Cloverfield themes,after filming already had started.
        ```

    - u/Tenoke:
      ```
      It's been on my watchlist for a while and I think I've seen it mentioned in the sub, too (maybe by you?). I'll check it out finally, thanks for reminding me.
      ```

    - u/aeschenkarnos:

      And a great performance from John Goodman as the villain. Not rational, but consistent and (unfortunately) realistic.

    It depends a little bit on how high your standards are for making sense, but you might like Knives Out.
    ```

  - u/MagmaDrago:
    ```
    Well, if you can swallow characters acting (mostly) sensibly within bounds of a dark and bizarre conceit (bonus if you like dark comedy) then, I'd recommend:

    - Dogtooth (2009)
    - The Killing of a Sacred Deer (2017)
    - The Lobster (2015)

    Fair warning though, there's going to be NSFW content, and the character dialogues can seem stilted and weird but you get used to it pretty quicky and, IMO, it adds to the movies instead of detracting from it.
    ```

    - u/SvalbardCaretaker:
      ```
      The Lobster was sooo funny.
      ```

  - u/Do_Not_Go_In_There:
    ```
    You can check out these, they (mostly) meet the "one-set movies" requirement and are character-driven: Moon, Circle (2015), The Martian, Exam, I Am Mother, Mother! (2017).
    ```

    - u/Tenoke:
      ```
      Of those, I only haven't seen Mother! so I'll check it out, especially as I've been meaning to see more Aronofsky. Thanks.
      ```

  - u/SalfordSamizdat:
    ```
    *The Sunset Limited* is a one-set, dialogue-driven film based on the Cormac McCarthy play. In a dingy flat, Samuel L. Jackson's character tries to convince Tommy Lee Jones' character that he is wrong to want to commit suicide.
    ```

    - u/Tenoke:
      ```
      Yeah, I've seen it. I think it's well worth a watch and the acting was great but it didn't stand out quite as much for me as I thought it might when I started it.
      ```

      - u/SalfordSamizdat:
        ```
        I thought the ending was a bit anticlimactic, in terms of providing resolution to the problems posed by the characters. But having two of the best actors alive (in terms of delivering dialogue) bottled up together like that was something I was always going to enjoy.
        ```

  - u/aeschenkarnos:
    ```
    *Spring* (2014). It’s a creature/body horror *and* a romance. The main characters make, in my opinion, reasonable and rational choices in the context of their, particularly her, knowledge and experience.
    ```

- u/duckorgies:
  ```
  A somewhat specific request: I am looking for a story where the protagonist is initially lazy (as in, has potential but does not utilize it), and grows to become competent. Preferably rational, but non-rational recs would be appreciated as well. Thanks in advance.
  ```

  - u/chiruochiba:
    ```
    The best example I can think of is the main character in *[The Red Queen's War](https://www.goodreads.com/series/109248-the-red-queen-s-war)* trilogy by Mark Lawrence. He starts off as a shiftless, cowardly prince who only cares about his own comfort, but he gets drawn into an adventure against his will that makes him grow significantly as a person. 

    Mark Lawrence's setting has interesting world-building and well written characters with no idiot balls. I highly recommend this, and his other trilogy in the same setting, though neither of them counts as rational by the sidebar definition.

  So I'm reading Galactic Economics and the financially illiterate aliens are being introduced to the concept of money and banking by a couple of random Earth shmucks with a hacked-up app.

  And I *want* to object that surely it wouldn't be just a couple of random shmucks.  But I'm sort of the random shmuck heading up AGI alignment on my home planet.

  And then I got to the end of Chap 2 and the author /u/rook-iv is like:

  >Some people have critiqued this chapter on the grounds that established financial institutions would have thought of this idea on day one. I appreciate the feedback, but that is a rosy view of the velocity at corporations in my opinion. I've personally worked in some of these companies, and if someone brought up this idea, it would probably have taken at least a month to get the idea through various risk audits and legal reviews.

  Which, like, yes, that's perfectly plausible, I've seen only a little but enough to know so, all the big actors *would* be bogged down in Legal Discussions, and so it *would* be two random shmucks with a hacked-up app, you've convinced me, *fine have my rec.*

  A couple of weeks ago u/NTaya asked for monster/human romance; this isn’t quite that, but I thought of them when reading [Devourer of Worlds: A Lavos Spawn Quest](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/devourer-of-worlds-a-lavos-spawn-quest-chrono-trigger-x-rwby-crossover-au-elements.45591/). To pull from the author x50413’s description its “a Chrono Trigger / RWBY crossover in which the players control an eldritch space parasite of nigh-infinite magical power that invades the world of Remnant... and the players decide to be nice to the tiny hu-mans.”  The author x50413 does an excellent job of writing job of writing inhuman protagonists.  I recommend listening to the ‘recommended listening’ that they sometimes provide; while I usually skip it, x50413 is really good at picking appropriate music.

  They also have an account on Questionable Questing and write [Just as Planned](https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/just-as-planned-waifu-catalog-si-worm-start.11767/), a well written if somewhat straightforward Waifu Catalog SI. It features the Simurgh as the first Waifu Choice. She’s alien in mindset, if not form, so I hope that you find it worth a look, u/ NTaya.

  I’m looking for recommendations where the protagonist builds something(s), whether they’re building a company, a town, a dungeon, or tinkertech; I’m not sure if it’s just me, but they feel similar on a fundamental level.

    Dungeon Keeper Ami is an excellent build fic.  It's a little rough at the beginning, but I enjoyed it despite not being familiar with either Sailor Moon or Dungeon Keeper.

    Beware of Chicken is also quite good.  It's about a guy isekaied into a Xianxia world who decides to go build a farm and start a life for himself instead of cultivating.  It's very well-written, well-paced and wholesome.

    Vainqueur the dragon is a kingdom build fic that's funny and a lot of fun.

      Brockton’s Celestial Forge on Sufficient Velocity is the best tinker fic that's currently updating that I'm aware of.

      Demesne is a town builder on RR, and The Fallen World : A Dungeon's Story is a dungeon builder.

      The Way Ahead on RR is pretty interesting if amateurish; right now the protagonist is building out his home in the wilderness.

          [Brockton’s Celestial Forge](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/brocktons-celestial-forge-worm-jumpchain.70036/) is a polarizing fic. Early on, it was widely praised, but now that it stands at well over 1 million words, many readers complain that it has been stagnating for a while.

          For what it's worth, I found the main character unappetizing and dropped the fic early. Of the Worm-based Celestial fics, I prefer [Doomsday Prevention Toolkit](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/doomsday-prevention-toolkit-worm-mea-multi.930666/) and [Doormaker Dog](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/doormaker-dog-worm-celestial-forge.921389/). The former is a minor Mass Effect crossover while the latter is a minor WH40K crossover. Neither one is exceptional, but I find them to be pleasant and occasionally clever.

          Edit: [A Spark of Hope](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/a-spark-of-hope-worm-jumpchain.71370/) is also occasionally clever, but the first third of the fic is very poorly written. Apparently at some point the author got a beta reader and things improved dramatically.

            BCF - my God just fucking commit to something. It reads more like someone's struggle to get over their own issues through the medium of fiction and got stuck. No real problem with it, but as a fiction definitely not for me 


            Doomsday prevention kit - An integrated AI that can't connect to the internet, but can hack other shards. I was interested in seeing M.E tech playout without eezo. This just turned into a wishlist of powers.


            Spark - is the so Mary Sue it hurts. Her first power is a seemingly legitimate dice roll. Nanotechnology without any of the precursor tools. From there it goes downhill she gets the ability to make magic armor that just to happens to blend with nanotechnology, wtf how?, and wand waves all the struggle away. She needs a suit of armor to patrol? Well this new blend will let you do just that in a fraction of the time previously required! Fancy that. The next power is a scanner that can generate blueprints of any tinker tech, how would that even work? Isn't tinker tech 50% bullshit from shards?, and also happens to detect people. Man sure is lucky you got that right before your first patrol 2 days after getting Celestial forge.

              Well, stranger things have been known to happen. For example, consider [Pompoko](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/pompoko-worm-cyoa.19892/), a CYOA v3 story (or its expanded NSFW version on [QQ](https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/pompoko-a-worm-cyoa.4749/threadmarks).) It's an insanely OP build:

              > Absolute Stamina 8

              > Tanuki Physiology 9

              > Existence Manipulation 10 [!!!]

              > Mobile Invulnerability 8

              > Ability Intuition 10

              which made me wonder if it had been hand-crafted. However, the author later explained that:

                I agree. This happens a lot in BCF as well, the moment the protagonist has an internal conflict the dice brings a power that makes the conflict even worse, multiple times. This has been noted by the author themself and their beta reader multiple times. It's quite funny all things considered.

  Looking for a game recommendation if anyone has any suggestions:

  I'm looking for any multiplayer strategy, turn-based game, ideally playable on PC and mobile. 

  A few preferences: 

  1. I don't like games that can be won or lost on a single silly mistake, prefer more tug-of-war style which requires consistent good choices (Like Wargroove VS advance wars).
  2. More than 2 players would be ideal but not necessary, diplomacy is great but unlike Diplomacy (the game) I'd like to be able to win from skill not just politics. 
  3. Ideally free.

  One of my favorite games which is what I am after is Neptune's pride (Triton) which is basically Diplomacy in space, but would like something a bit faster. 

  Thanks!

    I can wholeheartedly recommend "Twilight Struggle".

    It's originaly a 2 person tabletop game, which is much easier played on pc/mobile.

    You play either  USA or USSR during the cold war.
    Strategic choices and long term planning are recommended, but there are also elements of randomness (Deck of cards + dices).

    A game takes about 2 hours and takes some time to get used to the mechanics.

    I often play with friends, but you can also play against strangers on a ranked ladder.

    Here’s a few from an iPhone perspective.

    The Battle of Polytopia: Civ-lite game that has tech trees, buildings, wonders but plays fairly quickly. Very accessible and also free.

    Strategery: clean implementation of Risk but with randomized maps and less bullshit.

    I’m actually a little surprised that I didn’t have more recs. My other close matches would be slow real-time (Auralux) or singleplayer (Hoplite).

    Of course, I’ve got to recommend Go. Cross platform! Tug of war! Emergent gameplay! No politics! Extreme depth! Free!!

      I thought that [Acolyte](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/acolyte-worm-warhammer-40k.311949/threadmarks) did a reasonable job of introducing the Chaos Gods to Earth Bet. The fic was semi-humorous and the Gods were somewhat sugar-coated, but it was made abundantly clear that their power would come at a terrible price which Taylor was almost entirely blind to. To quote Slaanesh in 3.1:

      > Have we yet steered you wrong, dear child? Come now, if you still do not trust us, enter your meditation… see the wonders of the Warp once more and all it has to offer

      It's not the greatest Worm fic out there, but it was pleasant.

    If you're familiar with the 40k verse, then you've probably heard of Ciaphas Cain.  If you haven't, it's a dark comedy in the vein of Flashman, about a commissar to manages to accidentally survive his way into being a war hero.  

    The book series is one of my favorites in the whole of the Black Library (40k literary universe).

    It’s possible you’ve encountered these, but my favorites are [the Culture explores 40k](https://archiveofourown.org/works/649448/chapters/1181375) (self explanatory premise, dead fic) and [Inquisitor Carrow and the God-Emperorless Heathens](https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8400788/1/Inquisitor-Carrow-and-the-GodEmperorless-Heathens) (Harry Potter returns from the 40kverse with some changes; absolutely glorious crackfic).

    There are not one but two major 40k/Evangelion crossovers, but I’ve only read [Shinji and 40k](https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3886999/1/Shinji_and_Warhammer40k) (like the Imperium, it is ancient, huge, and ambiguously dead or on hiatus), which continually outdid itself with the integration of the 40k elements. It really blurs the lines via convergent evolution of 40k stuff vs. the 40k metaphysics sneaking in.

    For non-crossovers, I remember reading an Inquisitor quest by open_sketch, but I can’t find the link. It had a lot of good moments but has some intentional deviations from canon that may or may not bother you.

    Cai Renxiang from **[Forge of Destiny](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21188/forge-of-destiny)**. Admittedly, this is less Heroic Responsibility and more Ruler's Responsibility, as Renxiang is the direct Heiress of a massive province in a harsh Xianxia setting, but they are very similar philosophies approached from different angles. 

    It's most personified in this little speech of her's, after (Spoilers for the sequel thread) >!being questioned about why she is seemingly unconcerned with both killing multiple bandits herself and allowing the rest to be sentenced to death.!<

    > >!“Then why? Do they just not matter because of who they were?” Ling Qi shot back.!<

    > >!“They matter, and their victims matter, and the soldiers matter,” Cai Renxiang replied sharply. “I am calm because I know that I have been responsible for uncountable deaths, merely because of who I am. I am the heir to Cai. Every man or woman dead to bandits, every executed criminal, every soldier, every person who has met their end to privation or carelessness under my family's rule is my responsibility. It does not matter if their end came at the stroke of a pen, a headsman’s axe, or burned away by my light. The blood is on my hands all the same. That is what it means to be ruler.”!<

    > >!“That’s a little arrogant isn’t it?” Ling Qi replied. “Even your Mother can’t be everywhere. People make their own choices no matter whose in charge at the top.”!<

The ones who rule construct, shape and execute the systems under which our people live their lives and make their choices. If our people are slain by foes, it is because we did not protect them. If they starve it is because we have not provided for them, if they turn to crime, it is because we have failed to provide a virtuous path on which they can live.”!<

The world does not allow us to have mercy for bandits, but the world does not need to be one where bandits exist. The world is far from that state. To protect those who you come to rule, you will be forced to confront your failures and the failures of your neighbors. But you must remember. We can improve. The world is ours to shape, and just as vice arises from vice, virtue arises from virtue.”!<

    The second book (*A Desolation Called Peace*, which is just such a fucking banger of a title) in the Teixcalaan books by Arkady Martine has one of the biggest Heroic Responsibility moments, and it's a total tear-jerker.
    ```

  - u/CaramilkThief:
    ```
    Recent chapters of Ar'Kendrythist have been like that, although it's not exactly heroic responsibility either. The recent arc has been about the protagonist really understanding his station and power in the global scale, and using that power responsibly and for good. That results in some moral grey area consequences as well as it's wont to do when the main character has the strength of a nation and is dealing with other nations.

  ```
  I want to personally strongly recommend [ar'kendrithyst](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26727/arkendrithyst), especially those who (like me) dropped it after the first few chapters. 

  Like a year ago, I couldn't get past the interactions between the MC's in the first few chapters. A while ago, I skipped the first 4 chapters and just read from there, now its IMHO by far one of the best generic Isekai's out there. At the point the story currently is, its as satisfying as AH, with a rational, well-thought out world/magic system along with an intelligent and very realistic set of MC's. 

  I'm mostly rec'ing it here again because Arc's patron is woefully undersubscribed for the quality of their work, giant weekly chapters and consistent quality. 

  For some reason, the early chapters seem to turn people off; I'm here to tell you to give it a bit more of a go. At least \~40 chapters in it really starts getting strong IMO.
  ```

  - u/TREB0R:
    ```
    I dislike the logic of telling someone that dropped it due to not liking the early chapters to stick through the first 40 chapters and then it gets good. Those 40 chapters are what I'm estimating to be about 150,000 words, a ridiculous amount to ask someone to read for a story that they aren't enjoying to become good.
    ```

    - u/Dragfie:
      ```
      I'm not telling you to do anything, just wanted to add another datapoint for those who do not mind sticking it out and are desperate for a good isekai that its very likely they will enjoy this even if they didn't at the start. 

      I personally started enjoying it like at chapter 4-8 it was just the very start that bugged me personally which I just skipped in the end, but from the discussion on it previously in the rec threads, a few people said the same as me and everyone who disliked it did so for subjective things happening early in the story (which is normal) but most of them seem to go away as it progresses. 

      (E.G. MC gets "used" by everyone; he does, but as he develops in power, intelligence and confidence this stops happening, as an example of one such thing that didn't personally turn me off but might turn someone off at the start which doesn't persist)

    > the early chapters seem to turn people off(...)~40 chapters in it really starts getting strong 

    You explained it yourself why it doesn't take off, and why it may never. 40 chapters is around ~600k words. At the average reading speed it will around a full work week to get past that point, and almost 3 work weeks to catch up. That's just untenable for most people.

    (Despite saying that, I agree with your rec. I'm even a patron. )
    ```

    - u/TREB0R:
      ```
      It seems the author had shorter chapters at the beginning of story. My estimate of 150,000 words was probably low, but I'm pretty sure it doesn't break 400,000.
      ```

    - u/Dragfie:
      ```
      The \~40 chapters may have been a bad estimate, I personally started enjoying it at like chapter 5, just by 40 most complaints I see about it go away. 

      It's really a shame though, its such a good story, the lackluster beginning is really bringing it down.

      Its been a while so can't remember much about the prose then, but yeah the tone and dialogue of the interactions and generic Isekai beginning put me off too. If you're after a rational Isekai though I'd recommend  you try just skipping a bit in, I don't feel like I lost much because of my skip and its not just me that thinks it really improves.
