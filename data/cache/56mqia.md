  So that's why the name didn't work the second time. Very good, I did not see that coming. 

  The part about Aaron's fanfics really cracked me up.

  So, if Sarah still can reach to other machines through the internet, I'm guessing she didn't lose her "computer" powers in the new body and can still talk super fast.

    Technology works differently now, so I guess it's not impossible that a computer in a person's body can still connect to the Internet.

  Things I anticipated:

  * There are not 3 more books still to go, with titles "Leviticus," "Numbers," and "Deuteronomy." We're too far into the narrative for 3 more books, plus those are terrible titles.

  Things I did not anticipate:

  * Sarah made Aaron forget the ensouling name. I had firmly rejected Aaron's hypothesis that the reason the name had ceased to function was because he was saying it wrong.

    ```
    Yeah, got to admit, that surprised me because I'd assumed it was a blatant example of Aaron making a false conclusion.

      If I had to guess, I'd say the last one will be called Revelations. It's been done before often enough.

    I never considered the possibility of him saying it wrong because that would mean having unclear spots in his mnemonic. All that talk about never forgetting a name and being a super mnemonist? He'd never mangle such a vivid mnemonic, which he must have been rehearsing the while day.

    The solution in the story is even more problematic: Sarah had to not only to change his memories but also plant a crystal clear mnemonic consistent with the new name... If the confounding name is that powerful, then it is a memory rewriting name and completely game breaking. I had gotten the idea that it simply made you forget things.

    I feel we have been a little misled about the capabilities of the confounding name...

  So, Sarah is a computer with body dysmorphia which causes her to undergo an operation to give her a form which matches her self-image of being female.

  Does that make her a trans-sister?
  ```

- u/MonstrousBird:
  ```
  So, Sarah has told all this to Countenance's IT guys, who will be checking his emails for clues to his whereabouts, presumably...

  By the principle of As Above, So Below, it's now quite clear that the Bible is God's dirty fanfic.

    The Song of Songs as Uriel's attempt to figure out human sexuality:

    "YOU ARE LIKE A THING HUMANS LIKE. UM. HUMANS SEEM TO LIKE LIVESTOCK A LOT. YOU ARE LIKE A HORSE. MY BELOVED. A FEMALE HORSE THAT A RICH KING WOULD HAVE. YOUR PHYSICAL FEATURES ARE LIKE VARIOUS ANIMALS AND PLANTS. GOATS. SHEEP. BUNCHES OF GRAPES. FOR INSTANCE. UM. YOUR BREASTS ARE LIKE BABY ANTELOPES."

      Wait is that an UNSONG quote because if not somebody needs to send it to Scott Alexander

        Not yet. He can borrow it if he wants!

        Not yet, I think

        Horses; badly behaved godlike entities writing smutty fanfic ... I see how you got there.
