  My very quick TL;DR is that a political deal was brought up involving saving the Uchiha Clan by agreeing to have (or facilitate the having of via other fathers) ninja-children with a fair number of (consenting, 18+ years old) Uchiha women. The player base went very far out of their way to make sure this was all morally tolerable by 2019 standards, but there were still apparently reports on this as 'eugenics'.

    Wait they locked a _story_ because the _story_ contained what they consider immoral content?

    Please tell me I’m misunderstanding and the author was advocating real life eugenics in his thread or something.  Please tell me they aren’t banning books.

    Edit: wait it’s some kind of game?  Like a MUD sort of thing?

    Edit:  Oh it’s like a 4chan quest.  I get it.

      It's a forum quest. The story has a main protagonist and POV character, and everyone votes on what he does, and the QuestMasters write the results in story format, and everyone votes again.

      That said. Stories are banned all the time. There's no explicit sex allowed on fanfiction.net for example.

      - u/lolbifrons:

        I get it now.

        Yeah I mean private platform or whatever, but choosing to ban books IRL is “worse” than eugenics in a story, even if there are reasonable arguments that it shouldn’t be _illegal_, in my quite reasonable opinion, if I do say so myself.

        Would they ban any Fullmetal Alchemist content just because the core setting details are atrocious?  Or are they assuming that if it’s not explicitly decried very blatantly in-story that’s tantamount to authorial (or player) support for an atrocity?

          I couldn't tell you much about SV in particular. I would definitely be disappointed if MfD got removed over this, or the QM's were forced to remove the 'offending' deal. 

          I know SV has a general reputation of being quick to ban but the only example I've personally seen seemed reasonably justified as 'banning a thread full of calls for straight up real-life genocide' and not 'banning a story with immoral content', so IDK.

    - u/Sophronius:
      ```
      But nobody in real life is going to become a ninja or torture people based on this story, so that's not a threat *politically*. "Eugenics" on the other hand sounds like a far right belief, so the fact that some kind of 'eugenics' has been practised by royal families throughout all of history and this is just a realistic part of the setting becomes totally irrelevant. The actual concern is that people will think being far-right is socially acceptable.

      It's just more of the same stupid culture war, IMO. Otherwise people would not have reported it.
      ```

      - u/meterion:

        Which is kind of a laugh in itself when you realize how eugenics is already happily plodding along in today’s society what with pre-natal screening for various genetic disorders and hardly anyone gives a hoot about it.

        - u/IICVX:
          ```
          Umm not really - eugenics specifically applies at the population level, in accordance with some sort of governmental breeding policy.

          Individuals making their own decisions isn't eugenics.
          ```

          - u/eaglejarl:
            ```
            The definition I see is "The science of improving a human population by controlled breeding to increase the occurrence of desirable heritable characteristics." No requirement that it be state sponsored.

            Granted, this deal was not at the individual level, but neither was it at the state level. It was a political deal between two clans, in which all of the women were enthusiastic participants.
            ```

          - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
            ```
            A lot of people interpret it that way, and worse, see "eugenics" as in "any action taken to actively improve the human gene pool" as the fundamentally immoral thing - not the whole "killing people" bit. I've seen eugenics brought up re: the situation in Iceland where basically there's no more babies born with Down syndrome due to prenatal screening. Now, if you're anti-abortion, at least that's a coherent position. But if you're pro-choice, then it's utterly ridiculous to decry as "eugenics" the sum total of a lot of free individual choices women take with their own bodies and lives (because guess what - raising a child with Down syndrome is *hard* and emotionally taxing and most people would rather not go through that because of some abstract notion that some people with Down syndrome *ought* to be born because... nature wants it? God? Or something). If we could just CRISPR away the genes coding for a thousand horrible genetic diseases that'd be eugenics by this definition. But what would be wrong with that?

            Yet that's a position I've seen. "Oh, this is horrible, it's *eugenics*." 

            Even as far as unethical practices go, eugenics by arranged marriage isn't as unethical as eugenics by genocide. It's just as unethical as arranged marriage itself.
            ```

          - u/meterion:
            ```
            All the definitions I’ve seen for it simply state that it’s the promotion of desirable genetic traits over others through selective breeding. In this case, the promotion is simply happening in utero. 

            Besides which, it often is the government who is promoting prenatal screenings. While eugenics often has the connotation of a compulsory program, I think voluntary ones qualify as well.

        >The actual concern is that people will think being far-right is socially acceptable.

        If I thought that was a legitimate concern here, I'd be sympathetic as I believe making fascist beliefs socially unacceptable is a worthy goal (though I still wouldn't support it, as I think making it socially unacceptable should be done by social pressure and public shaming rather than locking threads and such, or any other kind of censorship). But the situation here isn't that; this doesn't even seem like actual eugenics, and even if it were, depicting eugenics is not normalizing (or rather obstructing attempts to denormalize it) fascist ideology.
        ```

        - u/Sophronius:
          ```
          I'm totally on board with fascism being bad, and I remember arguing that Less Wrong was making a mistake in allowing itself to become an alt-right haven, but... making certain views taboo has a really, *really* bad track record. Making broad topics like politics taboo, okay, fine. But social taboos on sex, alcohol, prostitution, drugs etc. have \*all\* backfired in the past and I feel like we should draw a lesson from that. I think the biggest part of the problem is that once you make something taboo it becomes impossible to talk about it rationally, and that only ever makes things worse. If you even argue against the taboo you will be accused of defending the thing itself, making correction impossible.

          In this case: I think that the actual result of making fascist ideas taboo is that well-meaning liberals mistakenly attack generic right-wing ideas as fascism, and then a lot of smart people get frustrated and leave, resulting in a downward spiral resulting in discussions getting dumber and dumber until nothing of worth is left.

        You're right, QQ probably is what I was thinking of. Though I think I do also remember a couple of stories I've read being kicked off of SB and migrating to SV afterwards, so that probably contributed to me conflating the two sites.

        >I think the real issue wasn't the in-story content per se, but a rather uncharitable reading of posts in the thread as dehumanizing towards the women in question

        Ah. That's more understandable, but I'd still almost always side against the decision to shut it down. Obviously it depends on the specific posts as there are some things that simply cross the line, but I'm someone who plays Rimworld, a community where statements like "How do I optimize my human leather furniture production" wouldn't even seem particularly unusual, so I tend to give people a lot of leeway about 'dehumanizing' fictitious people.

      The popular connotations of eugenic programs are mostly based on forbidding people from having children, rather than encouraging particular people from having children with particular other people. While the same word technically applies, the ethics of the two are very much different.

        >"Genetic engineering to cure diseases is eugenics!" Okay, you've got me there: since eugenics means "trying to improve the gene pool" that's clearly right. But what's wrong with eugenics?

"And what was wrong with what Hitler and those unethical scientists did?" "What do you mean, what was wrong with them? Hitler killed millions of people! Those unethical scientists ruined people's lives." "And does using genetic engineering to cure diseases kill millions of people, or ruin anyone's life?" "Well...not really."

        It is a program based around breeding people with a specific gene that allows them to manifest the Sharingan.  That is textbook eugenics.  


        They also didn't do much to stop the coercion in reality, they just made themselves feel better about it.  The coercion is the social pressure that if you don't participate in the program, you will be responsible if the Uchiha clan perishes.  MFD players talk all the time about how social spec is broken and then fail to see when social spec will be used in horrible ways.

          At that point I don't know what you want - if the deal wasn't taken, those same girls would have that same pressure, except to go find random ninja and do their best, which seems strictly worse for them. Certainly no other clan or group the Uchiha could deal with would be as concerned about them as the one effectively led by a group of young 2019 people.

            Not necessarily. The thread was locked due to discussion of eugenics. Whether or not the program is a eugenics program is germane to the discussion, even if you believe that it's good. Saying "this is not bad, therefore it is not eugenics" would be foolish, same as "this is eugenics, therefore it is bad".

                It's possible to answer the first question with "yes" and the second question with "no", but saying that the second answer is "no" and therefore the first answer must *also* be "no" is ridiculous.

  I'm currently reading Deep Red on the same website and it has dealt with far more morally repugnant topics than a small scale consensual eugenics program involving adults (which probably won't be written about IRL for years). I'm not even sure eugenics is even inherently immoral, let alone a topic so egregious that it shouldn't be discussed in a fictional story. Honestly, this could have been a non-consensual eugenics program and still been tamer than some of the things in Deep Red.

      There are three big websites for Questing and Creative Writing that share the same format/style, called SpaceBattles, Sufficient Velocity, and Questionable Questing. 

      Questing is like a story/game where people vote for what the main character does, and an author/Game Master/Quest Master writes chapters of the story based on their votes. 

      SpaceBattles is more dedicated to regular fanfiction as opposed to Quests, and occasionally you'll see the extremely rare and miraculous 'actual original content' there more often than on the other sites. It does have a Questing forum, but that isn't as active as the ones on the other sites. On the other hand, the mods are very strict and will ban you at the slightest hint of content that isn't PG-13. 

      Sufficient Velocity is more focused on Quests as opposed to fanfics, and formed as an offshoot of SpaceBattles over a controversy when they fired a moderator. It's probably the best Questing forum out there, and they have more leeway in regards to mature content. On the other hand, the mods will ban you the moment you comment anything that isn't 100% politically correct, even if it's very obscure and you had no idea there was a group that would take offense about it. 

      Questionable Questing is even more focused on Quests than Sufficient Velocity is, to the extent that there is barely any activity in their Creative Writing forums. I suppose you can infer this from the name. This forum's thing is that they let you be intolerant and write porn, but you need an account to access(or even be able to see) their 'Not Safe For Work ('NSFW')' forums. On the other hand, most of it isn't very good, and well, even when it is good it probably has erotica in it.

        My experience of SV is limited; MfD takes up so much of my time and energy that I don't tend to browse the rest of the site all that much.  That caveat stated, my experience of the mods there has been very positive.  Especially when I was participating in the politics threads, I felt that they used as light a touch as possible and usually didn't drop the hammer too fast.  Sure, there have been some cases that I thought were a little much, but nothing egregious.

        In contrast, my experience with SB was that the mods there ~~went off faster than sweaty nitro and their standard tactic was to nuke everything in the general vicinity~~ used their authority far more often and in heavier-handed ways.
        ```

        - u/Evilness42:
          ```
          I was exaggerating a little for effect with the level of punishments they give, but those are the general areas that mods on each site focus their attention on curtailing (in the Fiction and Quests forums, at least. I don't lurk the Politics sections.). 

          SB nukes threads with mature content, and SV will infract you and maybe temp-ban you if you write something that might insult a minority. They don't do it if it's explicitly a character in one of your stories saying it, but then again it's not exactly the same thing as a ban on mature content. 

          It's true that the SV mods are a little more lenient than the SB ones, and their first reaction is normally to search the thread and apply minimal punishment to transgressors as opposed to the SB policy of dropping bombs and sorting out the rubble when they find the time. 

          Really though, it's very unlikely that you'll actually run into an actual problem with the mods on either site unless you act out significantly and end up getting into an argument, deliberately start breaking rules, or continue after they specifically announced 'don't do this!' to a thread.

            Not sure I agree; this whole affair was ridiculous. The mods unilaterally locked our thread for multiple days and handed out a bunch of infractions and tempbans because of reports about bad content in the story, which they later decided was not bad. (Granted part of the duration was down to the fact that all of the QMs had IRL commitments that made it hard to get together and explain ourselves to the mods, and then there was about 10 hours of downtime as SV moved to Xenforo 2.)

            At the end of the day, the mods acknowledged that the actual content of the story was legit -- one very messed up character set up a deal that was...ethically gray at best. There was a lot of money and political favors involved, but the core of it was that a bunch of Uchiha civilian women would be adopted into the protagonist's ninja clan and required to have a certain amount of children who would then be adopted back to the Uchiha. Mari, the massively messed up character, was the only one to speak positively about the deal and everyone else objected. I, the author of that particular piece, was extremely clear about the fact that everyone involved was 18+ and that the women were all enthusiastic, since having children with ninja would drastically increase their social and financial status.

            No, that wasn't the issue. The issue was that a few of the players had said things that, if you read uncharitably, were mean to the fictional characters. 

            And yes, I understand what the mods were angry about and I'll be good and never ever ever do that again, and I'll keep in mind that apparently as a QM I have a duty to be a moderator for my players and tell them not to say bad things about the characters and to delete the bad things they say or I will have to tell on them so that the actual mods can rap their knuckles.

            Yes, I understand and will comply because I don't want the project that I've been spending 15-20 hours per week on for the last >3 years to be arbitrarily shut down.

            It's still ridiculous.

        I don't mean to be rude but, did you actually look?

        As for the SFW side, Creative Writing has like 40% more posts than Questing, and the entire front page of CW has posts only from the last week whereas Questing is so dead it has a post from April on its front page.

        The NSFW side is considerably more active though, and the Questing/CW sub-forums are pretty much the same in terms of usage. There are of course far more comments in Questing, but that's just the nature of the system.

              I contend that is none of those things. What counts as "politics"? Tell me at which point the following becomes political:

              The villain is a fat, ugly man...
              ...who stole the throne from the person the people actually wanted based on a technically...
              ...and he is portrayed as a narcissist...
              ... And he is phenomenally dishonest...
              ... And he cheats on his wife with a sex worker...
              ... And he refuses to pay the workmen who built his royal palace...
              ... And his name is Dan McUnobjectionable
              ... Or Ronald Dump.

              What counts as political commentary  is subjective. That means it is not simple or consistent. And it is most definitely not a good idea to ban it.

                I mean, if you push your story explicitly close to the line, you're gonna find out where people draw the line. But there's still huge areas of unambiguity, and in general QQ is way more politically tolerant than SV, see the WtR debacle. As I understand it, the point of the rule is more to make people take reasonable steps to avoid political topics of debate; as long as you don't deliberately and sustainedly push things *towards* (irl) politics, you should be fine.

                Not a mod though. You should ask them!

          Yes, as I said. It's not exactly anti-state, but it tends to be people who know the inherent value of liberty, which I see more as a Liberal than Libertarian position. Though ofc those have significant overlap.

  Thank you all for the support.  /u/absolute-black has nailed it in [zir's summary](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/ccfw90/marked_for_death_got_locked/etmo7hr/) about what was happening in-story that caused the lock.

  A few observations beyond that:

  * Although I would have preferred a more communicative start to the lock, the mods have moved quickly and mostly been very pleasant to interact with.
  * Things are moving in a generally positive direction.  The mods read all the posts since the deal was originally proposed (76 pages, ~1900 posts!) in just a few hours and got back to us.  They recognize that we took steps to be very clear that everyone involved was 18+ and consenting.
  * There are still some questions to answer but I am cautiously optimistic that we will be unlocked by Sunday.

  The timing on this is unfortunate, since all three QMs are heavily time-restricted right now due to IRL stuff, and SV is undergoing a major infrastructure change that I'm sure has been taking up a lot of the mods' energy.  It's slowing things down as communications are running asynchronously.  Still, I'm hopeful.

    There was a political deal between the Uchiha and the Gōketsu (the protagonist's clan). 

    Years ago, nearly all of the Uchiha ninja were killed, drastically decreasing the clan's power and wealth. The deal that caused all this trouble involved money and votes moving back and forth in various ways, but the core of it was that (summarized) the Gōketsu would adopt a bunch of Uchiha civilians, including 11 women. Those women would be required to have children with ninja and the children would be adopted back into the Uchiha, the hope being that some of them would be ninja. The women were all enthusiastic (having children with ninja drastically increases a civilian's wealth and status), and were allowed to spend as much time as they wanted with the kids after they went back to the Uchiha.

    The character who proposed the deal is currently pretty messed up, and when I wrote it I was very clear about the fact that everyone would be 18+ and enthusiastic. As a result, the story content was deemed acceptable. The problem was that (a) some of the players said things that could uncharitably be considered callous to the women and (b) the QMs did not serve as mini-moderators and call the players out for saying these mean things, nor did we run off and tell the mods that some of our players were saying mean things about fictional characters who were engaged in a deal in a fictional story that the mods judged unobjectionable.

    And, just in case the SV mods are reading this: Yes, everything I said in our discussion is true, I do comprehend your point of view and I'll be a good boy and toe the line because I don't want more than 3 years of my work to get arbitrarily shut down. You're still being ridiculous.

      I really hope this doesn’t mean self-censorship. It’s prevalent in modern-day mainstream media as it is. IIRC, *[With This Ring](https://np.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3yxxop/ff_with_this_ring_moving_threads/)* had to face a somewhat similar problem a few years ago too, though there it was spacebattles with a knee jerk and sufficientvelocity itself as the new safe haven. Seems like WTR [had to switch once more since then and has left SV by now too] (https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/WithThisRing). Seems like it’s in the nature of the beast for such forums, over time. 

      I am sorry that this happened to your project. There are probably some concerns that the story’s quest format could end up killing it in case of migration because of the risk of too many of the players not following to the new location for further participation?

        That's exactly what it means.  From now on, whenever I write a chapter I have to check it over with an eye towards "If the mods are feeling pissy, is this going to offer them an excuse?"  No, I'm not happy about it.

        Actually, I'm totally onboard with that last one.  I'm not familiar with what happened on SB, but on SV Zoat went actively out of his way to earn that ban.  

        > I am sorry that this happened to your project. 

        Thank you, much appreciated. 

        > There are probably some concerns that the story’s quest format could end up killing it in case of migration because of the risk of too many of the players not following to the new location for further participation?

        Pretty much, yeah.  Also, there aren't a lot of good choices.  I refuse to use SB because of negative history with the mods and the community.  Multiple players have asked that we not go to QQ.  We could post on (e.g.) AO3 and have the discussion in Reddit, but then it's hard to do voting.

      This *is* how they operate.  They'll reopen it after they decide how to handle it.  (Which last I heard was waiting for a discussion with the QMs.)

      In fairness, them locking the thread has certain advantages for us.

      First, they wanted to hold off on doing anything until they had read literally every post, all ~1900 of them, since the deal was first proposed back in chapter 271.  As fast as the thread moves, the only reasonable way to do that was to lock it.

      Second, the fact that it was locked prevents anyone from accidentally making things worse.  

      I'm not thrilled about it, and I wish certain things had happened differently, but I do understand why they did it and I can't fault them for doing so.  They have a duty to protect the community, protect the site from legal liability, and protect the site from being associated with content that will harm its brand.
      ```

      - u/-Vecht-:
        ```
        The fact that they are responding in a manner consistent with their incentives does not make their actions reasonable. *Why* exactly do they have to read every post in order to make a determination of whether or not to take moderation action?

        Further, I find the argument of "they have a duty" to be strongly at odds with any notion of us being "advantaged" by an action like locking the thread with nothing but blithe comments about the thread and it's conduct until well after the debacle. If their reasoning is indeed that they are acting to protect corporate interests, then they are explicitly making the tradeoff to devalue your time, the other QM's time, the players' time, the quest's reputation in the eyes of the community, etc., in favor of said interests. I realize your hands are tied here in what you can say and how you have to respond -- I just want to register that I find it appalling when authority is wielded as a tool to engender complacency in the face of value misalignment. 

        And RE: Making things worse.

        ...

        Damn, I am so glad they are protecting us from what they might have to do to us if they let us run afoul of their sensibilities in protecting their corporate interests. So noble of them.

  It's notable the lock is almost certainly going to be undone by the end of the weekend, assuming the QMs have time to talk with the admins.

  There may be some retconning to alter the deal to be acceptable, but probably not unless the admins are being quite overzealous.
