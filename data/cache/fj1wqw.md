  This is the Three Houses fic I've been working on a while...  I wanted to wait to post it here until I'd written enough of it that readers could solidly understand what the story was like.  Now that it's over 55k, I can't really claim it's just getting started, even though it's still very much in its early stages.  Anyway, I really appreciate any sort of feedback, so please don't hesitate to sing its praises or write a livid takedown of my incompetence as a writer.  

  Also, I'm not 100% sure whether it really counts as rational fiction?  Please tell me what you think on that.  I didn't set out with the intent of making it rational fiction, but my own tastes are so informed by ratfic that I think it may have ended up being ratfic anyway.

    Whether or not it's rational fiction, I thoroughly enjoy it.

    Especially not knowing much about the source material, I enjoyed the exposition.

      As someone who does know a lot about the source material, I also thoroughly enjoyed the exposition.

      I'm pretty much obligated to re-expound all relevant lore because I'm changing so much of it.  So, if something isn't changed, I have to make sure the reader knows that even if they're familiar with the game's lore.
