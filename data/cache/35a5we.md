    Out of curiosity and an interest in constructive criticism, by "the only pokemon fanfic I've managed to stay with" are you excluding mine, [The Origin of Species](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9794740/1/Pokemon-The-Origin-of-Species)?

      ... Absolutely, and I'm pretty embarrassed to have made that mistake. My only defense is that in my head I have a division between "rationalfic" and "regular" fan fiction, and yours is one of the former.

        I was actually excited to find someone who reads other pokemon fanfic that might be able to give negative feedback, so no need to be embarrassed at all :) Glad to hear you're enjoying it regardless!

          I'm up to chapter 6. With this story, I think if you examine each paragraph separately s/he's a much better writer than you in a strictly technical sense. The descriptions are more rich, the world is more vivid, and the "characterizations" are a lot stronger. (Yours has been rapidly growing chapter by chapter in this regard - I haven't seen your re-writes but the later chapters are markedly better.)

          But I personally liked your story as a whole better. This one more or less playing everything straight, and it feels like I pretty much know exactly what I'm going to be getting from chapter to chapter. With yours I felt a flair of unpredictability and the characters were curious about things as I would be.

          I also find it kind of jarring in this story how *all* the pokemon are pretty much all sentient, even down to the little rats and butterflies, yet neither Red nor anyone else seems to really give a shit. (I'm sensing the potential for some amount of subversion with Red being able to Mime so this might be revoked later as his pokemon communication abilities grow, but right now it doesn't feel like the author is planning to fully cash in on that, since Red *already* has enough information to know that most pokemon are sentient but doesn't seem to care.)

          I suspect this is mostly a matter of me having more psychological common ground with you than with the GoC author, and with me having a stronger taste for subversion and unpredictability than most. (as we all do on /r/rational)

  I thought this was very good, but still distinctly clunky/amateurish (mostly for reasons already called out - awkward language, power-fantasy hero, no reader fair play), and the sexual dynamic makes me distinctly uncomfortable. Wish it were paced better, or that I placed better than 5% subjective odds of it finishing within ten years.
  ```

  - u/Kishoto:
    ```
    What exactly about the sexual dynamic makes you uncomfortable? Not going to spoil anything, but as far as i remember, it's only been brought up 2-3 times max in the fic. And when it is, there's nothing explicit, and the event isn't even the focus of the situation.

  First chapter. Don't tell me the Mr. Mime is his father...

  I can't say I liked this one too much. The prose is good and the battles are exciting but the story is just a typical darker retelling of the game. I didn't really like the main character and his narration. He's very stoic and doesn't show much emotion so I couldn't really empathize with him. He doesn't come across as a nice person so I had a hard time rooting for him. At times it felt like the story was a bit too dark just for the sake of being dark. Your mileage may vary though, and I know /u/DaystarEld liked this one.

    I do indeed: it's definitely the best Pokemon fanfic I've tried, of a sample size of about half a dozen.  The others, often also attempting to be "dark and gritty," had too discordant of tones or the writing was just too bland.  In this one the narration/protagonist was the main stumbling block I had at the beginning, but after a few chapters it didn't bother me as much and I got to really appreciate the world building, story and other characters around him.

    That said, I don't particularly consider it "Rational" for a number of reasons, most specifically because he and Blue keep winning  by exploiting things that only they're aware of at that moment (for example how he won against the Starmie: it was an amusing callback to a glitch in the first game where Toxic and Leech Seed combined to double the effectiveness of Leech Seed, but I had no way of knowing that this was how the world functioned, and the in-universe excuse was that he used some rare and specific toxin that was very obscure). This makes for very compelling and exciting storytelling, but I can see it getting old if it keeps happening.

      Have you ever read "Brave New World" by Ri2? It's not rational, and it was basically discontinued rather close to the end, but it is a really good epic pokemon fanfiction. The author has read tvtropes very extensively, and there are a lot of shoutouts to just about every well-known franchise imaginable and then some. Basically it's a sequel to the pokemon mystery dungeon rescue team games, except that the character you played as in those games is replaced with an amnesiac Lucario named Ash and his partner is a samurai pikachu who has yet to earn his name...

      The very basic structure of the plot is actually based on Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door, although it's a LOT more complex and interesting than that.

      Even though it's not complete, I highly recommend it. Maybe if we get enough people reading it, someone might be able to take a shot at completing it or doing a meta-fanfic reboot, or convince its author to come back and finish his work himself.

      It's also kind-of a sequel to an earlier work he wrote called Latias' journey, but it's definitely not necessary to read that first, since it wasn't as good and Brave New World stands on its own just fine.

        2.4 million words! That might be the longest fanfic I've ever seen.

      > the in-universe excuse was that he used some rare and specific toxin that was very obscure

      Not to mention impossible to figure out in advance. The reader is not told that this toxin exists, that it works this way, or that the protagonist has contacts that give him access to it. [Fair Play Insight](http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/level2intelligent) this is not.

      (I still like this fanfic a lot though.)

        Yep, exactly.

  >Three warriors around a table, two to a side, one to the other

  (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻

  ^(either two to a side, which makes four total, or two on one side, one on the other)

  (I don't know why this bothers me so much, but it does. Whelp, I'll try to give it at least a couple chapters)
  ```

  - u/ZeroNihilist:
    ```
    Also, "two to a side" could mean there's eight total, assuming it's a quadrilateral table.


    "One to the other" obviously means that there's eight bros chilling around a table, three warriors at another, and one lonely dude at the last table. Poor guy.
