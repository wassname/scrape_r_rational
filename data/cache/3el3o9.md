## Once Upon a Time Munchkinry post

### Post:

Magic is insanely powerful in the Enchanted Forest. But how exactly would you go about achieving godhood, given the same resources as Emma Swan? If you want a real challenge, start without any magic of your own.

Factors of interest (off the top of my head):

Removing your heart can grant extremely limited immortality at the expense of love and other positive emotions.

In Wonderland, you can be decapitated without dying, while causing constant intense pain.

Genies can grant wishes if obtained. However, as always, said wishes will screw you over if possible and still cannot break the Rules of Magic.

Rules of Magic (all of which have been broken):

No resurrection (broken with Rumple by the Dagger, with Maleficent, and with Anastasia by obtaining all genie lamps at once.)

No time travel (broken one-way by Regina to retrieve poison apple, and by Zelena.)

No induced love (broken by Jafar with the three genie lamps.)

  1. "I wish to become a Culture GSV/Mind, over the next 10^5 seconds"

  2. Win.

  One thing they often say in the show is that all magic has a price.  Which means that most attempts to munchkin it will fail; the answer to "why can't I use the magic to do X" is that the price will be really bad.

  Of course, you can still munchkin the "magic has a price" rule itself.  After all, things that benefit you may harm other people and vice versa.  Whether something is a "price" or a "benefit" and whether it is large or small is purely arbitrary.  (If you can cast a spell to make your army win a battle, and the price that they all die when the battle is over, could an enemy spy, who actually wants the army to die, cast the same spell?  After all, to him, the roles of price and benefit are reversed, so for him, the benefit exceeds the price.)
