  Obviously the most important thing we learned here is that things can randomly become pokemon for seemingly no reason.  We knew that "artificial" pokemon were a thing before this, but we were never told how they come to be.

  What is the mechanism here?  Did someone/thing do it on purpose or is it just a property of the world?  This seems like something people should invest/bet a lot of money on studying.

  - u/ZeroNihilist:

    This is certainly the most relevant for the titular question (The Origin of Species).

    My guess would be that it's not human-directed, but may be derived from human understanding (e.g. as some sort of residual effect of the psychic collective).

      In one of the discussions on typing, Red offhandedly refers to some types of pokemon as artificial.  That's pretty much all as far as I know.

  I liked this chapter, although.

  First! Positives!
  I think you portray character shock, surprise and confusion quite well. Bill's explanations of things are well done, easy to follow, and easy to reason with. The subtle "huh, this is weird" about the meal are good.

  Second! Critiques!
  The hologram "tour" was a little weird, felt wedged in. If Bill really didn't care that much, there'd be more evidence of carelessness about the system. Like if you got in a Tesla and the seats were uncomfortable (not that that's true).

  It's lectury. More tell than show, even in the location descriptions; which kinda feel like they're just there to tell me how much of a research genius the guy is.

  Something feels less-than-optimal about Bill, in his actions with the world. Have you ever seen Elon Musks' bit about first principles? His example is batteries: he says (paraphrasing), "you look at the price of the batteries, and then you look at the price of the elements that go into a battery, and, well, they don't add up. Batteries are too expensive."

  Then you look at Musks' current work, and you see: Well, you look at the dangers to the future of humanity, and you pretty much get: We're all on earth, and we use polluting energy. How do you fix this? Well, rockets. And renewables - specifically, for home power, and for transportation power.

  There's this simple-direct-single-mindedness style that's present in that thinking that doesn't quite come across from Bill. Now, Bill's not Musk and probably doesn't need to be, but in my limited experience, people that ridiculously accomplished have some simple driving underlying principle - Stark is fiction because he's "just good at everything" and then picks up interests. Real people get that ridiculously good for a /reason/. What's Bill's?

    This made me consider that I should have probably put some of Bill's characterization later in the story in here. The reason I didn't is because there's a particular scene I have in mind for when it's supposed to come out, but it would definitely make this chapter feel less "lectury" and make Bill more of a character, so maybe I should do it after all.  I'll see if I can rework the later chapter, and if so, edit this one.

    Thank you for the feedback! I'm glad you enjoyed the chapter despite its flaws :)

- u/SometimesATroll:

  In the future, when you have a lot of dialogue and lecturing to get through, I'd suggest splitting it up somehow.  Maybe only have part of the conversation "on screen" and then have part in a conversation later where Red explains it to Blue, with some action in between.

  Having it all together here breaks up the flow and makes it feel preachy.

  Also, while the AI and Raikoth parts are interesting, I'd suggest shortening them (or moving them) if they play a major role in upcoming events, and removing them completely if they don't.

  Hey all, welcome back! This chapter took a lot of extra time to write due to research, and still managed to hit 10k words again. It's rather information dense in places, and there are some rather obvious shoutouts to specific people in our world. I tried to communicate their ideas as best I could, but am not an expert on any of the mentioned fields. More than any chapter before, I'm worried about inaccuracies I may have made in this one, so if you spot anything that's not right or is a poor explanation of one of the concepts, please let me know!

  Similarly, I'm concerned that I didn't hit the pacing as well as I could have, so more than usual, all feedback and specific suggestions on the writing is welcome.

  If you're interested in learning more about the AI topics talked about here, may I recommend [arbital.com](http://www.arbital.com)? It's a fantastic new site that attempts to teach high level concepts in easy to understand ways. Raikoth was stolen with permission from the great [slatestarcodex.com](http://www.slatestarcodex.com), which has dozens of top tier, informative, and persuasive articles on all sorts of topics. I don't agree with every conclusion its author comes to, but I always respect and admire the meticulous journey he walks through to get there, and always learn something from following along.

  Finally, a quick note about my site: I've started adding blog posts here and there, on assorted topics. I don't have an RSS feed set up for it yet, but will soon: in the meantime, feel free to check it out and let me know what you think.

  Thanks for reading, and enjoy!

    I enjoyed the chapter, though i suspect it would have worked better in an actual book than a webserial. I think taking a chapter that people have waited weeks for, and then barely progress the plot, instead opting to talk about some interesting real world ideas, is going to leave many readers unsatisfied.
    ```

    - u/DaystarEld:
      ```
      Thanks for the feedback! I totally get the frustration, and hope I can make up for it in the next chapter, which will be a lot more action packed and plot progressing.

  I really enjoy this story, but this chapter was.. kind of unpleasant for me.
  Maybe it's my personal preference, but the painfully direct real-world references are not doing any good for the world building.

  In HPMOR, there are some direct references to psychology researchers, but they make sense as the HP universe is our real world universe+hidden society. Here it feels very out of place. 
  Beside this, EY used his author notes for promotions and similar things, which I think is more appropriate. Heck those can be really influential, it led me (I have an incurable disease affecting my living quality) to sink in a lot of money into a certain medical company with zero gain. But this made me re-calibrate the trust I put in EY and not my judgement of HPMOR.

  If you leave the promotion for your own pet projects or those of your friends in the story, this story might be seen in the future as something in between
  "The cool pokemon story where the author advertised these world changing applications before anybody ever heard of them".
  and
  "The cool pokemon story where the author advertised his crappy pet project that disappeared a few years after"

  Wouldn't it be nicer to just be the "cool rational pokemon story"?


  If the references are naturally part of the story, it works fine though.
  So mewtwo as the AI in a box and pokeballl-cryonics are both great ideas.
  For the ladder,  Bill could rather just mention, his research suggests the damage done to human brains happens in the phase of getting out of the pokeball and not when they get in. Then it would be much more rational for Red to jump to his current conclusion without even questioning anything about the claim.
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:

    Yeah, I can definitely see why that might dilute it. I'm going to be rewriting this chapter at some point, hopefully soon. When I do, I look forward to your feedback :)

  >As long as whoever draws that unlucky straw doesn't do something monumentally stupid, like try and control it and use it for themselves.

  Does Bill know anything about the Mewtwo project, or is he just very astute?
  ```

- u/AmeteurOpinions:
  ```
  I also think this chapter is bad, but not quite for the same reasons. Essentially, my suspension of disbelief no longer exists now. With this chapter you have *significantly* attached all the extra context of AI and such to your story, even going so far as to name-drop many actual people. I guess that's fine if that's really where you intend to take the story, but it does make *Origin of Species* that much less unique. Oh well.

  The only other real problem is that it's just too long. No matter how much research you do, it's never necessary to include an entire constructed argument in the chapter -- especially when you are replacing a chapter of a long-running serial with said essay! The only justification for it to be in the story was for the last few lines, so that an AI/Pokemon can be taken as scary. But we already had the Mewtwo interlude, so you can guess where it was going a third of the way through this chapter, so the tension just falls away.

  I wish I had something more positive to say. Your story is still very well-written and unique, just... less so, after this one.

  I think you should cut this chapter. It's too anvilicious.

  They're going to be in bills house for a while, so consider simply splitting the content of this chapter up, across a few conversations. The pokeball-cryonics conversation should probably be part of an entirely different chapter, as an example.

  No shame in doing some rewriting, and right now I don't think it's really persuasive for people who aren't already in the rationalist community core. Rationalist fiction should teach people, not just rationalists.

    I could do that, yeah. I actually added the pokeball-cryonics thing last (obviously it's at the end, but I mean I wrote it in after the chapter was done) because I wanted to bring it up so Red was aware of it as a safety option earlier than usual, but I'll see how the next chapter at Bill's flows and shift it around if necessary.

  For some reason it won't let me drag to copy the text on the fanfiction site but I really loved the exchange when Red tried to pitch funding his research to Bill, and Bill denied. 

  It would have been cheap for Red to get a "technical" win on the self-imposed "funded through self-merit" by having Bill who's insanely rich and the stakes would be extremely low to fund do it. 

  But, Bill denies! And he doesn't mince words, but also doesn't slam the door shut in his face or admonish him for trying. Just that it has to have potential. So find something, anything and come back and show me. 

  And Red to his credit, puts in perspective. Doesn't cry or feel sore about it. He accepts it. 

  //  

  I really loved that. Plus the last chapter; Red being denied by everyone but a flimflam operation. 

  I really like Red. My guy is taking his lumps for real.

    I really have a hard time understanding fanfic.net's thoughts on intellectual property. On the one hand, no problem using other people's settings and characters. On the other hand, we're going to make a big deal out of disabling copy+paste, poorly.

  I thought this chapter sucked. 100% mental masturbation, almost nothing actually happens. And not only that, it's mental masturbation about things that are only tangentially related to the story and almost completely unrelated to pokemon or its universe. If the entire thing would've been replaced with [](#s "mewtwo is an AI, you can capture abra here") I would've been happier. The allusion to the [](#s "mewtwo chapter") is about as subtle as a shovel in the face anyways.

  >No, don't calm down," Bill says, making them both turn to him. The inventor is smiling at him, and before Red's anger can turn to embarrassment. Bill puts his hands together in light, quick applause,

  I can almost see the marionette strings stretching from your hands to Bill's here. This just reads like a "and then he handed Red a crisp $100% bill while the national anthem played over the speakers and a bald spearow swooped in a window and settled on Red's shoulder and cried a single tear" story.

  If you want to talk about AI that's fine and it can probably be integrated into a great story in bits and pieces but I don't like how you stopped the entire story dead in its tracks just to lecture the readers about it and have literally all the characters in the chapter support one particular viewpoint (probably yours). I *agree* with the views expressed in this chapter but I don't want to read what is essentially a circlejerk about it in the middle of a pretty good pokemon story.

  I'll downvote myself to save you guys some time.

  - u/DaystarEld:

    So first off, thanks for the critical feedback. I asked for it, expected it would come, and you delivered. I'll do my best to address your points, but overall I agree with your sentiment. I've already made some edits, and I'm sure I'll make many more.

    And please reverse the downvote of yourself, I want to encourage comments like this :) I can take some slings and arrows if it means getting honest feedback.

    >things that are only tangentially related to the story and almost completely unrelated to pokemon or its universe. If the entire thing would've been replaced with mewtwo is an AI, and you can capture abra here, and I would've been happier.

    This is a situation I've been in before with the second interlude, where everything seemed completely unrelated to the plot where it currently was.  Rest assured, the information here isn't just for informing the readers or world building. 

    The problem of course is that putting in "foreshadowing," blunt as it may be, this early isn't always satisfying from a reader perspective. If I were writing this as a book, from start to finish, and then editing it afterward, I'm sure I'd make different choices about where the best place to put everything is. For now the best I can do is try to balance the plot progression with the world building, and that means occasionally missing the mark, as I may have here.

    >100% mental masturbation, almost nothing actually happens.

    Mental masturbation should feel good XD I spent way too much time researching to make that the case here.

    >I can almost see the marionette strings stretching from your hands to Bill's here. This just reads like a "and then he handed Red a crisp $100% bill while the national anthem played over the speakers and a bald spearow swooped in a window and settled on Red's shoulder and cried a single tear" story.

    Rewrote this section, thanks for the feedback! Is this a bit better?

      As someone who doesn't know much about the issues covered, I personally found it a) interesting, b) necessary setup, grounding, and exposition for issues and events that will happen later on in the story, and c) an interesting dynamic to feature just Leaf, Red and another character, particularly with the addition of having Leaf take the academic lead rather than Red, as is usually the case.

      I think the initial comment in this chain was overly critical and it isn't how I'dve put it.

      People have different preferences. I do enjoy the action scenes and the battling as well and that is a big part of what I read for; but the world you've created has a lot of characters with different threads and plots running concurrently. A chapter like this is necessary and seems perhaps more 'unsatisfactory' read in isolation, than as part of a whole piece. In that sense, the episodic nature of publishing is working against you and against some readers' perception, rather than the actual content of the piece being a huge issue, I feel.
      ```

    It sounds like what you're saying is that it has... pacing issues. Which the author acknowledges.

    >Similarly, I'm concerned that I didn't hit the pacing as well as I could have, so more than usual, all feedback and specific suggestions on the writing is welcome.

    You were ruder then you needed to be, you acknowledged a flaw that they're already aware of (but may have made him think it's more important then he already does, which could be good), and you didn't really include any concrete advice on how to fix it.

    I was going to write a similar post saying how I found it a bit anvilicious. That it might be alright if you're already pretty close to the core rationalist community but he should strive to introduce these ideas slower. But I don't think you handled that particular set of complaints well.
    ```

    - u/appropriate-username:
      ```
      >You were ruder then you needed to be

      Perhaps, and I did downvote myself for it.  I do like the rest of the story, it's just this chapter that did a pretty big shift in tone, IMO. It's like if Tom Sawyer had a sermon in the middle of it--I'm probably more upset because I liked the rest of the story and I like the subject matter presented here than I would be otherwise.

      If I've offended daystar with anything I said, I apologize.

      > and you didn't really include any concrete advice on how to fix it.

      Chuck the whole chapter. The majority of it feels like it won't be relevant to the rest of the story (and the majority is not directly relevant to anything in the story thus far) and out of place and out of step with the rest of the story. Either than or split it up into bits and pieces and pepper it throughout the other chapters. 

      I acknowledge the effort it probably took to research and write it and I know it'd suck to have it all be wasted but I can't think of any other way to salvage the pacing to my preference.

    Yeah, there's a lot of resistance to the idea by people who are distrustful of technology, which makes sense in a certain light. One thing to remember, and remind them of, is that self driving cars don't have to be perfect: they just have to be better than humans in terms of safety and efficiency, which they almost certainly will be.

    My view on this is a bit different. I *like* the idea of showing that the main characters are currently dwarfed by the power and importance of some of those they interact with. It ups the stakes, and puts their struggles in perspective of what they're trying to reach.  To be important in a world with people like Bill and Professor Oak and Giovanni in it, you need to do much more than just be a good trainer or researcher or journalist.

    You've got to be the best at what you do.

    Its a bit harsh to completely condemn it and claim it must be cut when we haven't watched all the dominos fall yet. Once the story has progressed further somewhat, it may be fair to look back and say "this was a low point", but to claim that it offers literally *zero* value with the information we have available is an extremely hasty conclusion.

    - u/Sailor_Vulcan:
      ```
      I think what it all boils down to is that it was just too fast. There was not enough foreshadowing, the plot felt like it was going in a completely different direction right up until this chapter. It doesn't flow, it doesn't fit, it's jarring as all hell. It was too much too soon. A lot of that conversation should be broken up and put into different parts of the story. Maybe instead of Bill spontaneously inviting them via professor oak, have something in Bill's AI research get public attention, and Leaf goes over there to get the scoop, and Bill reluctantly lets her in because he thinks she might portray his work more reasonably than other journalists (since she knows nothing about AI research and has not formed any preconceptions, and since she's the daughter of Professor Juniper). In fact, i wonder what would happen if Leaf went in there and Red didn't. Leaf would have a lot of interesting things to say to Red and Blue and would have to try to explain it to them instead of Bill. Imagine if Leaf was the one telling Red that he wasn't aspiring high enough. I think that would be a really interesting conversation.

  - u/DaystarEld:

    Yeah, that's the general idea: pokemon can grow older without evolving if they avoid combat, but the more they experience those fight or flight impulses and face real danger, the more likely they are to trigger the right changes to evolve.

  Late to the party an long time fan, just have to say thank you! While this wasn't one of my favourite chapters it did make me think a lot. This and To The Stars are among my favourite docs I've ever read and are some of my biggest inspiration for becoming a writer.

  I'm even working on a Fic right now taking a more realistic look at the Pokemon world, not nearly as scientific as yours nor as rational though I do plan to turn it into a more political heavy Fic, but that's me rambling!

  The main point I have to say is thanks for always bringing a smile to my face whenever I see a new notification email from you!
