  I think Red Axe legitimately has a pretty good point.  The T&T does in fact protect absolutely hideous people from the repercussions of the things they've done - and it means that they will face no punishment, even after all of this is over.  This is a world based on story logic.  Do you think that the conscripts that helped in the war to kill the Dead King will be punished at the end of their duty?  No, they'll get off scot-free.  That's the end of the story.  The end of one era and the start of the next necessarily means the creation of a blank slate - and stories crossing between the two are going to be far and few between.  Cat never really grapples with this; to her, the only thing that matters is killing the Dead King, even if it involves letting a rapist live.  Cat's new era and blank slate have real costs and the costs are all the people, usually villains, who have killed or raped countless people getting away with it in the end.  The T&T don't ask for heroes to make compromise with Evil, they ask for heroes to make compromise with evil, which is of course a much harder ask.

    Cat literally says “If you’d decided to kill him the heartbeat the Truce was over, I would have looked away and covered my ears.” How is that getting off scot-free?

    They are literally asking for heroes to choose the lesser of two evils, *for now*.

    The Dead King has done far worse than the Wicked Enchanter did; sure, it's not fair to let the Wicket Enchanter get off scot-free, but is it any better, in any sense, in *any universe*, to let the Dead King get off because you can't *delay gratification* until the Dead King is dealt with?

    I don't quite grasp what you're saying here. Particularly, compromise with the Evil Black Queen is emphatically contentious among all the new heroes we've met this arc

      Yep, the underlying tension of the last book and this book is that Catherine has the biggest Good nation over a barrel and is forcing them into following her lead.
