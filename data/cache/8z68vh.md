  I'm giving it a 90% chance that Zach not being willing to let Zorian into his mind is going to be extremely relevant to future events.

    Plus, more throwaway  comments that mean Zorian might have to fight Zach (Zorian complaining to the hydra that if they actually fought, Zorian would need help). It may be possible that if there is indeed some sort of compulsion on Zach, and if you break it, he attacks. 

    Add the comments about Zach being a very good actor - and while I'd still trust Zach, I'm not sure if I can trust a compulsed!Zach.

      > Plus, more throwaway comments that mean Zorian might have to fight Zach 

      If we're talking about foreshadowing, this chapter also presents a divine compulsion that is much more insidious than boring mind control.
      ```

      - u/I-want-pulao:
        ```
        That's a pretty good point! Add to that the fact that Zorian is trying to figure out divine energies... So you have Zorian trying to solve a different problem which gives him the tools to solve this problem as well.

        At the same time, I still think mind magic compulsion is a better story, because we've been leading up to it for so long (Zorian is unfairly amazing at it) and so Zorian using his mind magic powers to solve a problem has more in-story support. Divine energies and compulsions are extremely recent.
        ```

        - u/09eragera09:
          ```
          Doesn't it kinda lend more support to the whole "Zach's being mind controlled" theory tho? QI knows a fair bit about divine magic, while RR does not. RR had shitty mind magic (considering he had a plain old mind blank, instead of a proper active defense), and so far we havent seen QI demonstrate any decent mind magic abilities (as far as I can remember). If Zorian develops some sort of divine sight, he could potentially figure out if Zach is being altered in some way, tho that does leave the question of why QI didn't figure the same out.
          ```

          - u/I-want-pulao:
            ```
            Along with the question why QI didn't figure it out, it took quite a bit of time for QI to figure out the divine tracker when they robbed the treasury. QI hasn't taken that amount of time with Zach's soul. Secondly, we can assume that RR had 6 restarts to get QI to help him (without arousing his suspicions).... And especially is RR is Veyers (or even that lawyer) then they are super young and will raise his suspicions. I'm not sure if getting his help, and convincing QI to place a divine compulsion on a random teen is possible in that amount of time.

            Mind blank is pretty damn powerful on its own though. And, RR had shitty mind magic from the POV of Zorian, who is ridiculously powerful. RR was able to mind probe Zach in Ch 26, that tells you he's no slouch in mind magic (compared to non-Zorian psychics)
            ```

            - u/waylandertheslayer:

I'm not sure if getting his help, and convincing QI to place a divine compulsion on a random teen is possible in that amount of time.

              From those six months, he only needs QI's help. After his marker is modified he has however many restarts to talk QI into messing with Zach.
              ```

    - u/meterion:
      ```
      Another thing I haven't seen mentioned yet is that Zach is **very** eager to learn mind magic... from anyone/spider but Zorian. I imagine at least one part of the compulsion is to encourage him to learn to defend himself to keep the compulsions better hidden, while keeping away from anyone significantly skilled that could detect them.
      ```

      - u/I-want-pulao:
        ```
        Hmm. Well, before he met Zorian, he worked on his mindshield just enough to avoid immediate threats and go on the offensive (Zorian described Zach's mind shield as.... barely adequate). So he hasn't been very eager to learn mind magic before he met Zorian for realsies.
        ```

        - u/thrawnca:
          ```
          Not actually proof, because he faithfully followed what most mages consider to be the most practical method of mental defence. Conventional wisdom says, get some basic mind shields and then focus on whacking the other guy before he gets through them.

          So, if it was the kind of compulsion where you follow a command to your own best efforts, which we've seen before with Zorian dominating the iron beaks, then it would be logical to see Zach's defenses plateauing when he thought they were good enough, and escalating again now that he's working with a powerful mind mage.

          This isn't the first time he's sought more defence training since meeting Zorian, either. He reluctantly agreed to let Xvim tutor him. Xvim isn't psychic, so there's no way he can peek by accident.
          ```

          - u/I-want-pulao:
            ```
            That's fair. However:

            that seems a ridiculous method of defence - to only improve in mind magic if you are consistently interacting with a powerful mind mage. If mind magic is THE danger, then it strikes me as rather naive to accept conventional wisdom re safety. It only takes one mind mage that can overpower Zach (tbf, not very many can do so) but Zach accepts drinks from everyone and anyone. It's not like Zach can identify mind mages on sight, like Zorian can. 

            Also, subverting the iron beaks was easier because quite a few of them were not big fans of Sudomir. How much of their initiative was because they really really hated Sudomir and the invaders?
            ```

  - u/matematikaadit:
    ```
    I've this suspicion that Zach that we know is actually not the real Zach.

      ```

      - u/Ardvarkeating101:
        ```
        More likely the former rather than latter, honestly.  Zach is a pretty cool guy, and if he wanted Zorian gone he'd.... huh.  He hasn't actually had a chance to get rid of him yet, has he?  Sure he could beat him in a fight, but never permanently.  He didn't *used* to have the skills to do any damage to Zorian's mind or soul, so he was a stuck in a "if he attacks me, I'm fucked, but if I attack him, he'll just reset and *I'll* be fucked" situation.  

        Huh.
        ```

        - u/ProfessorPhi:
          ```
          My money is on the fact that Zach and Zorian can't both exit the loop so they end up fighting to choose who survives.
          ```

          - u/kaukamieli:
            ```
            And it will end when one notices something that allows them both to leave.
            ```

          - u/turtleswamp:
            ```
            I expect the solution will ned up being a modified shifter ritual.

            It's been established that shifters are a human soul and an animal soul in one body, that a modified ritual can reverse that and make a wolf into a human-shifter, that the guardian's objection to letting more than one soul out is that it doesn't have ethically sourced bodies for the extra soul and displacing a soul from outside the loop would be murder, and that the main risk of being a shifter is that there's soem cross-talk between the souls.

            So, Zack becomes a Zoian shifter, shifter-Zack leaves the loop with both souls. Then shifter Zack tracks down original Zorian and makes original Zorian a loop-Zorian-shifter. least effective result is Zoinan resets to pre-loop except now he has a power-up form with the shaping skills he learns inside the loop, best case scenario the similarity of the souls makes for a clean merge and Zoian gets to exit the loop complication-free. Most likely scenario both loop and original Zorian's personalities co-exist for a bit while loop Zorian's soul overpowers the original. The souls are very similar so this mostly manifests as original Zoian judging loop Zoian for being too reckless and amoral.

            I don't think it was even vaguely implied, but by the time they met Zorian had just undergone a major course in soul-defense courtesy of Alanic while Zach was an amateur at best.  Plus, Mind Blank is a really fucking hard spell so most necromancers Zach could convince to work with him couldn't do it and thus Zorian could see them coming and reset before they did anything.

                ```
                Except Zorian knew how to reset by this point, and does it every single time he's died (that we've seen) just to avoid such a scenario.  He could attack by surprise, but Zach doesn't have soul sight to check how fast Zorian can actually do it, and him fucking up once is enough for simulcrum mind magic expert Zorian to fuck him pretty hard.

        The ability to do things like that is rare. Zorian was unimpressed by RR's mind magic. I'm not sure how to make that outcome make sense.
        ```

    - u/rtsynk:
      ```
      my suspicion is that the 'real' Zach is evil, but that he had all his 'evilness' and associated memories suppressed so that he genuinely doesn't realize it right now, but then something will trigger the blocks to be cleared and it will be revealed how this was all part of his evil master plan
      ```

      - u/dbenc:

          ```
          Isn't it late for foreshadowing? We're very near the endgame now..
          ```

  - u/MaxDougwell:
    ```
    Evil!Zack is a certainty in my mind at this point.


    Here's the narrative as I see it with Red Robe as Zack:

    Zack grows up resentful of his family's betrayal by the nobility of Eldemar. His guardian gives away various treasures to placate the royal family, including the Dagger. The reason Red Robe could access the Dagger is he is the rightful owner and could have used political pressure to reclaim it.

    Zack and a certain like-minded friend get in with the planned invasion, which already involves numerous high-ranking individuals resentful of Eldemar.

    Zack puts on a fake persona at school.

    Zack starts the loop a month before the invasion, to ensure it's victory. He uses a simulacrum to trigger the Gate, allowing him to start safe in his room every loop and avoid suspicion. Side effect: The simulacrum exists at the start of every loop and technically has the marker. The simulacrum starts looping alongside Zack.

    SimuZack deviates from the original. We've been shown how even a day old Zorian clone will play pranks and get annoyed with the original, and that's with the increased mental connection allowing them to partially remerge afterwards. SimuZack is just as selfish as original Zack and has no hope of surviving even as a memory, so he decides to make sure he's the one out of the loop. He ambushes original Zack and uses his limited mind magic to program him. Unfortunately, he can't exactly soulkill his mana source. So instead he forces new!Zack to play along in the same role he's always played at school, makes sure no-one but him can access Zack's mind, and orders Zack to focus all his efforts on unsubtle power-building magics rather then anything tricky or subtle. I think we've seen this programming slowly decaying, but it was built by someone with plenty of time and an intimate knowledge of the person being edited to make up for magic skill limitations.


    The end result is one brainwashed, actual Zack and one unchanged Simulacrum Zack. Simulacrum Zack then discovers there are others looping. He panics, then panics more when, on checking the original's mind finds they're complete unknowns to Zack. With no idea how this is even possible, he bails, confusing the Loop. Zack has now both left and not left the Loop.


    Endgame: Zorian and Zack both escape, with Zack and simulacrum Zack being merged in the original body, removing all compulsions and editings applied to him. Who knows how he'll react at that point.

  This comment has been edited in support of the protests against the upcoming Reddit API changes.

  Reddit's late announcement of the details API changes, the comically little time provided for developers to adjust to those changes and the handling of the matter afterwards (including the outright libel against the Apollo developer) has been very disappointing to me.

  Given their repeated bad faith behaviour, I do not have any confidence that they will deliver (or maintain!) on the few promises they have made regarding accessibility apps.

  I cannot support or continue to use such an organization and will be moving elsewhere (probably Lemmy).

      And from the ending

      ```

      - u/DrainageCity:
        ```
        Wasn't there a line a while ago, when ZZ were first proving the loop to Silverlake where she had a complete 180 in terms of sass when she actually started taking the idea seriously?  I don't remember what it was, but while most people seem to think along the lines of "Well, there's nothing I can really do about this, I guess I'll just go with the flow," Silverlake took the loop as someone killing her over and over again, and took that very personally.  I think that all of the reasons she'd be such an old and accomplished mage are also reasons she'd want to try to escape the loop, even the mini-loop ZZ took her into.  She's probably afraid of death, she's incredibly driven, and she's very confident in herself.  I absolutely think that if she's given the option to sacrifice everything to escape the loop dimension she will take it in an instant, just so that she doesn't die.  Also, if she gets out in a way that means there's two Silverlakes, that probably isn't much of a negative to her.  Either she avoids her other self or she cooperates with her, but either way, it won't really matter since she doesn't have much contact with the outside world.  If that's impossible (I don't remember if it was established or not), and she has to fight her original soul for control of the body, she seems like the type to slaughter her doppelganger in a heartbeat.

        All in all, I think she's got nothing to lose and everything to gain, as well as every reason to try to escape the loop.  Of course she's nice and helpful for now, she's got a whole roomful of people chasing the same goal as her, but as soon as they stand in her way I think ZZ will find her to be as big a threat as QI.
        ```

        - u/icesharkk:
          ```
          There's a strong theory brewing that there might be several Silverlakes that escape through the primordial. She's made it seem like the walls of the cell are mutable and overbalance to her. If she can open the way once it may leave a mark she can see. That information should make it easier for her to get out again.
          ```

      - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
        ```
        She probably already figured out how to convert her marker into a permanent one and didn't tell anyone. And probably plans to stay behind in the time loop after Z&Z leave, so she can exploit all the remaining loops for all they are worth.

        Hence why she is cooperating now on finding the artifacts, since she would need them herself in the very last loop iteration.
        ```

        - u/meterion:
          ```
          I don't believe she'd be able to do that unless she's able to pull a RR and forge her marker into a Controller, since the loop will end when the last Controllers do. That would be a bit much since her specialty is not apparently in soul magic.
          ```

          - u/zonules_of_zinn:
            ```
            she does seem like she's in a good position to make a deal with QI though.
            ```

            - u/meterion:
              ```
              True true, but if you thought dealing with *one* night-immortal supermage was tough when the other party was trying to be as honest and upfront as they could, imagine how it'd be when they're both paranoid farts!

              Only way I can imagine that kind of deal working out is if QI can do either a memory (or even soul?) packet, while also giving silverlake some slow-acting soul poison so she has to keep up her end of the deal to give the packet back...

              The more that I think about this the more possible it seems.
              ```

              - u/zonules_of_zinn:
                ```
                silverlake seems like she has the upper hand in biological poisons.

                but maybe a soul-poisoned memory packet, that slowly decays the mind around it, instead of itself. would also have to soul-explode if improperly removed.

                (unlikely silverlake would take such a trap.)

          i swear everyone else is going to be screwed over due to her interference. Still though i don't think she's very scary as far as mind magic is concerned and that may be the saving grace that "saves" everyone if shit goes wayside.

    They're both stabilisation frames; maybe they'll manage to perform Q-I's soul merge with Zorian's external self by bolting one of those on to prevent him turning into a gibbering nutter. Combined with them being the same 'base' soul.

  The title of the chapter made me think that they'd manage to get the royal family's support. However, this is actually better! While this was a set up chapter in many ways, a lot of stuff that ZZ had been leading towards, happened.  Enjoyable and important, but not seat of pants on edge enjoyable.

  Also interesting to see that Zach acknowledges that they have lost the moral high ground, and now it's the time to take what they want, hang morality. (the restart didn't end, so we have 17.x still left).

  Prediction : they will find a way to get centuries inside the world of the orb.  One last ditch attempt, and they'll be on their second to last or last restart when they figure out how to do it.  Then a timeskip, then they come out centuries later ready to finally win.

  I mean, maybe not. But it makes a kind of rational sense.  To solve a nearly impossible problem in a rational world, you need to be able to bring to bear an almost impossible amount of resources.  You won't be able to do it through luck and the handful of years they have left.

  - u/CaptainMcSmash:

    It's still a story though and that makes no sense in terms of pacing. To go from a desperate race against time in the final stretch, approaching the last obstacles and antagonists only to get a century long time skip before the confrontations? No way that happens.

      They might figure it out anyway, apply it back in the real world. Even at a lesser magnitude. A portable black room they can charge and teleport at will would be exactly the sort of thing Zorian would wet himself over in pure excitement. Especially with the extra size meaning he had a portable black room/workshop to play with.

          Sure. But it's not like that's impossible. The author' mentioned non-liche immortals lack stigma. They've got access to two potential methods of being unaging as it is, even if one is lichedom and the other is through Silverlake.

          Wether or not they'd want to is another matter, I suppose.

      Maybe.  Remember we rationalists are essentially hoping, even expecting based on the evidence, this very thing to happen in the real world.

      We're expecting that once advanced AI begins to earnestly be developed, for the tools to self improve to the point that you have a machine agent that will be able to make as much usable progress in key areas of science and technology as all of the progress we have made since the Enlightenment.

      Well, if we don't screw up and it blows up in our faces.

      But the goal we need as primates made with deeply flawed bodies and programming code is we need to develop medical science as far as we'd get in about 10,000 years at the present rate of progress.  Or all 7 billion people alive today are going to die within their 'natural' lifetimes as well as some unknown number of billions of people who haven't been born yet.

    Nah, they can't stay inside a black room for centuries. Not unless Silverlake is willing - and has the materials - to brew potions of agelessness for everyone, which I doubt.

      They can't stay in there regardless of the age factor if they plan on doing anything magical. While Zorian and Zach may be immensely wealthy, I doubt they have access to enough crystallized mana to sustain the lack of ambient mana in the time dilation chamber for themselves let alone the other newly added loopers.
      ```

      - u/thrawnca:

        Ambient mana speeds things up, but all souls can regenerate their reserves ex nihilo.

        I think that Zorian was assuming, a while ago, that using the orb would mean less actual time dilation but a much more comfortable and useful experience. There would be enough space to practise alchemy, combat, warding, golem crafting, etc, instead of just reading books and doing shaping exercises.

    You would think, but in all actuality, the more competent Zach and Zorian get, and the less effort it takes them to beat Ichl, the more likely when he loses he will instantly just nope back to his phylactery. He probably only stayed each time until he had no more options.

      - u/tjhance:
        ```
        It was suicide. From chapter 84,

        > Zorian had no idea that a person could detonate the outer layer of one's soul in order to launch a massive suicide attack on the souls of everyone in the vicinity, but even if he did, he would not have expected Quatach-Ichl use such a maneuver after less than a minute of consideration. Zorian knew that he would be unable to act so boldly if he had found himself in Quatach-Ichl's shoes, and it boggled his mind that a lich – people that are typically obsessed with personal survival at all costs – was able to steel himself into pulling off a suicide move so easily.
        ```

        - u/zonules_of_zinn:
          ```
          that's not actual suicide! he only blew off the *outer* layer of his soul, meaning the inner portion remains intact, useable, and alive. so he should be back at the phylactery (if he has one).
          ```

          - u/tjhance:
            ```
            yeah, but... the outer portion is still gone. his soul is not gonna be "just fine" after that.

            Also, the strength of his resolve wouldn't be so impressive to zorian if his soul was going to be fine.

            > Zorian knew that he would be unable to act so boldly if he had found himself in Quatach-Ichl's shoes

            Zorian kills himself (only to be fine in the next restart) all the time. If QI wasn't permanently harming himself, Zorian wouldn't have this thought.
            ```

            - u/thrawnca:
              ```
              Zorian has had a long time to get used to the idea that conventional suicide is harmless. The reality of the loop was beaten into him after he was repeatedly killed off and spent many months attempting to just go to class.

              Whereas QI took about 10 seconds to accept the loop and decide to blow himself up.
              ```

  - u/spanj:
    ```
    Maybe something akin to a soul well to keep his soul in the vicinity for just a little bit longer before it goes back to the phylactery. A few seconds could mean a whole world of a difference depending on how fast sifting through memories takes. That and teleporting in aranea to perform parallel memory sifting.

  It would be interesting if it's possible to perform blood enhancement rituals with animals. It could potentially speed up their rate of improvement in the field due to the inherent risk of mutilating their bodies. This necessitates the ritual being used only at the end of each restart.

  For example, like clinical research in reality, performing blood enhancement rituals on rodents, and then moving on to creatures more similar to humans, like apes.

  As for detecting divine energy, maybe asking the clergy would help? Or ransacking libraries of other churches as Alanic would probably be not so pleased at the idea of Z&Z attacking the Triumvirate Church.

  - u/lostatnet:
    ```
    Like clinical research in reality, I suspect that animal experimentation can only go so far before you have to switch to human experimentation.  Even with human experimental subjects, there are no guarentees since they only have 1 chance to modify themselves.

    In regards to detecting divine energy, I feel that studying the non-human spell formula of the Filigree Sages is the best bet.  Ilsa did say that structured magic (chanting & gestures) just limits the full potential of magic.  If anyone could learn to sense divine magic, it would be someone not limited to Ikosian-Style magic.

      ```

      - u/lostatnet:
        ```
        I was just thinking that maybe the Ikosian language itself limited mages in what magic they could perform.  For example, aranea spell formula seems to be highly compressed compared to human spell formula.  In particular, the Filigree Sages use their own unique glyphs for their spell formula & anchor them to spider webs rather than sturdier materials.

        Non-human perspectives may introduce a deeper understanding of magic that wasn't obvious from the start.  Like how the aranea use mind magic in ways that human mind mages can barely imagine.  Just because its possible, it doesn't mean that someone had already thought of it.

        That said, it doesn't have to be non-human.  The search for knowledge & tricks across Altazia & Koth might also produce similar results.  I am just hoping that all of this search for "*low*\-*hanging fruit*" (whether its non-human magic or human magic) crystallizes into something revolutionary.

  - if he had command of the hydra (kneel, don't attack zorian), why did he have to coax it to return to the orb?

  - zach wasn't willing to let zorian poke around his mind but was ok with spiders doing it? Will the spider say anything if he sees something? Maybe zorian could ask the spider to check some things on the downlow?

  - if QI helped red robe permanently join loop, why didn't he just do it to himself too? (unless the help was modifying a temp marker as opposed to creating one from scratch)

  - are they attempting to convert the orb to a black room so they have their own personal black room or something else? Even if they create their own personal black room, how are they going to power it up? The recharge time on the others is already substantial and this one should be even longer

    He has "command" in the sense of having a loyal pet, not full mental domination. It's like having a pet dog, just because it generally listens to you doesn't mean it'll instantly do anything you say.

      I hadn't caught that before, but even with word of god that doesn't seem doable. 

      Assuming the update rate doesn't pick up substantially that only leaves us 7 or 8 chapters away from the end then. It seems like you'd be hard pressed to wrap up just getting out of the loop even if you do things at a crazy pace for all those chapters, let alone solving things in the real world and wrapping up the dangling threads with the family and all the side characters we've gotten to know.

      More power to the author if there's a plan in place and they can pull it off, it just seems like it would be too hasty from the outside at least.

  The black rooms are much more useful for new agents (they would at least double the time they are spending in loop) - looks like they will get to know each other very well in the dull environments of black rooms.

  Converting orb into black room is just nice extra. Looks like the main purpose is to milk government institutions dry. By initiating this particular project and throwing a lot of weight/resources behind it - they get and extra teachers with little effort. Krantin seems like a very experienced researcher/geek into dimensionalism - so ZZ should reap some ( a lot of)  knowledge in there. 

  I wonder how they will reap what they saw. While the government will analyze the stuff they seeded around (as per suggestion from Silverlake), the rebels/cult/Ibasa should get hands on the intel as well. It may be hard to get the additional research done by various organizations, but hey - at least it provides enough distractions. 

  Zorian should stab hydra with dagger ( to see the effect). This is to verify if they need to kill the sulrothum high priest or it is just enough to steal the other knife (besides ring) to control the sand worm. Also Zach to allow borrowing hydra for one cycle (to allow Zorian one month of a very close interaction with hydra / learning the stuff). Not allowing for that would be just author artificially limiting Zorians grow rate.

  The mind magic and Zach/ aranea is interesting topic as well. After Zach bullies them into teaching him, I'm pretty sure the teacher would take a peek at his mind and discover/remove  that compulsion/anything else left at his mind without asking Zach first to unravel some hidden memory/plot advancement.

  what are the chances that the frog he defeated in chapter 37 to assist/rescue Yellow Cavern Guardians is the toad they are looking for? Coming back to it and revisiting the fungus plantation would possibly reveal another secret behind it. IIRC, the web just killed Zorian after he defeated the monster - there's some shady secret in cavern/location. 

  Too bad it's another 3 weeks (if the chapter is light) or 4  for the next chapter to come up. So much stuff going on in background, so little covered. So much ground to cover... This is going to take awhile.

  I spent the start of this chapter baffled about how Z&Z had already managed to get the dagger from the royal vault. Only realize now after looking at the comments that it was the dagger they got along with the orb a long time ago (that Zorian couldn't figure out).

  I think I might need to start rereading chapters before each newer chapter arrives. This chapter makes so much more sense now that I remember that one fact.
