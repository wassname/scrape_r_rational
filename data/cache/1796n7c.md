  [*Evil to Eden: Turning a Haunted Castle into a Bed and Breakfast*](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/69782/evil-to-eden-turning-a-haunted-castle-into-a-bed) just wrapped up it's first book. It's a slice of Life LitRPG where the MC inherits an abandoned castle out in the middle of nowhere belonging to his deceased great-uncle, who also happens to be a wizard trapped in a mirror. Also the castle is filled with undead, but they're pretty chill.

  It's a nice story. The RPG elements are present, but they really don't take up the story. There are fights, but it's mostly about the guy trying to renovate his new castle/B&B.

  [*Coin and Conformity*](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/coin-and-conformity-asoiaf-catelyn-si.1071515/), an ASoIaF Catelyn!SI fic that focuses on kingdom building, updated after a long hiatus...and was promptly threadlocked a few hours later. The story started out ok, but the last few chapters had the author make some questionable choices (>!the MC is a man inserted into a women's body, it causes issues in his/her marriage and leads to Ned cheating on Cat, now there's talk of him getting a paramour!<). I wasn't a fan of the latest developments, but it wasn't terrible. Still, some readers tore into the author and they needed to take a break. Dunno what's going to happen. I like the story overall though.

  [*Maverick Solutions: Crime Doesn't Pay \(Enough\)*](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/maverick-solutions-crime-doesnt-pay-enough-marvel-si.1066868). A Marvel OC-SI who was a fan of the comics decides to hire villains (starting with Shocker and Rhino) who are trying to go straight. Pretty fun, though it updates about once a month. Lots of fights, as you can imagine, but there's also a focus on the MC growing her business and her interacting with various heroes/villains.

  ---

  [*Sublight Drive*](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/sublight-drive-star-wars.1095425) is probably one of my favourite recent fics. It updates weekly too, which is nice.

  Basically an OC-SI who isn't a Star Wars fan but has seen all the movies at least once is reborn on Onderon right before the Clone Wars kick off. They eventually join the navy, then get put in command of a Seperatist fleet. The MC is trying to salvage something of the Separatist crisis before Dooku sabotages them all and Palpatine kicks off Order 66. 

  There's a focus on using novel tactics to defeat enemies, which I like, but I really like the characters. Meanwhile, the Jedi are finding that the war isn't as clean as they though tit would be. >!Bariss Offee!< is probably my favourite character - she's captured pretty early on, and finds, by actually talking to Separatists, that they aren't the evil aliens she was led to believe. Some of them are even quite nice.

  [*Shimmering Mist*](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/shimmering-mist-hatake-si-naruto.1094612/). The MC is Ohashi Hatake, an OC-SI in the Naruto world, and the older brother of Kakashi. He knows about the Naruto story, though he's born well before it starts. 

  The story starts with the MC fighting in the 3rd Ninja war. He's trying to deal with Danzo, who is trying to have him assassinated because he views him as a threat. Eventually he's recalled to Konoha and put in charge of his own squad, while building an anti-Root faction within the village.

  Anyone know of any good Crusader Kings stories? Or more broadly, stories that feature political maneuvering, inheritance, and dynastic matchmaking/genetics, bonus if it's across multiple generations and/or an extended period of time. Thanks! 

  I did try [Legends Never Die](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/legends-never-die-ahistorical-ckiii-gamer.1030193/) which had a strong start, with the MC being born in Denmark at the beginning of the Viking age, but I lost most of my interest when the MC became superhuman from stacking attributes and lifestyle perks(all of them), and then lost the rest when it became a sneaky Fate/whatever anime crossover. It's not bad or anything, just not really what I'm looking for, which is a more macro rather than micro CK2 or CK3 experience.

    I've heard that authors post CK2 fics on the paradox forums. I'm not too familiar with them (tend to stick to SB/AH and so on), though I recall seeing some fics there that looked interesting. I didn't really like the format though. You can give that a look.

  I want to recommend [Ghost in the City: Cyberpunk Gamer SI](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/62125/ghost-in-the-city-cyberpunk-gamer-si), Cyberpunk 2077 isekai with somewhat similar to the videogame system as a cheat. Main character is a female from our world trying to live her best weeb life being a big fan of Ghost in the Shell.

  Although, given that it's on the front page of Royalroad, I don't think it's unknown at this point. Just recently finished reading available chapters, and still can't distance myself from it mentally to read something else. And I haven't even touched anything Cyberpunk-related before this novel. Novel simply hit the right spot for me.

    I wasn't able to get into this. The grammar is rather poor and keeps yanking me out of immersion. Strange placement. of fullstops and, commas and bizarre tense-switching will be the two main offenders.

      ```
      Yeah, grammar in the first several chapters was also something that broke my immersion several times. I even started reading reviews and was very surprised when most people said "grammar is good". But it seems to have gotten better later. Or I simply got used to it. Or combination of both, idk.

    I didn't really keep up with it. It had real problems in terms of adult themes. The whole novel feels like it is for young adults. There is comic book villains in a story setting that is supposed to promote more Greyish characters. 

    On top of that the whole thing has an awful supporting cast and the Mc gets very overpowered rather quickly because of "cheat" powers. 

    I dropped it because I honestly didn't l know why I should read it

  This isn't exactly a recommendation or de-recommendation.

  I've recently started reading [Sublight Drive \(Star Wars\)](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/72498/sublight-drive-star-wars) on Royal Road.  The MC has been isekai'ed from our world, but only has watched the 9 main films and hasn't memorized all the lore from the Star Wars universe.  For reasons that are still unexplained, he's ended up (and has stayed) as a fleet captain with the Separatists, which he knows was on the losing side of the Clone Wars.  And he is fighting as hard as possible for the Separatists to win, even though he knows that Palpatine is running both sides of the war, and will eventually have the Separatists lose.

  A couple points of discussion:

  1) Early on, the MC uses a couple planetary slingshot (gravity assist) maneuvers to attack a Republic fleet.  That's cute and all, and not something we see in the SW movies. 

  However, I don't think the math checks out.  Let's take the Earth's orbital velocity and approximate it to 30 km/second.  In practice, you wouldn't get nearly that much unless you wanted to head directly in the direction of the Earth's orbit.

  Let's also suppose that the repulsors are turned off while headed towards the Earth, and then turned on to negate the Earth's gravitational pull on the outbound part of the slingshot maneuver, so you don't lose that delta-V. Let's be generous, and call that another 30 km/second as well.

  So gaining 60 km/second of delta-V sounds like a lot, right? And it is in the real world. But in the Star Wars universe, if you want to scoot around a planetary system in a reasonable amount of time, your ships have to be capable of something like 5 km/s/s acceleration. So the slingshot gained the ships something like 12 seconds of full-power thrust. That doesn't seem like enough to make or break a tactical engagement.

  You can have your Star Wars / Star Trek physics, where everything is too close together, and even the fastest fighters seem like they are flying at (maybe) 1 km/s tops, or you can have real-world physics... but you probably shouldn't mix the two.

  2) Semi-related to this. It wasn't clear from the movies how Palpatine inserted himself into the Separatist side of the fight.  In retrospect, it seems like quite a feat Palpatine [accomplished](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Grand_Plan):

  * Destroy the Jedi Order
  * Threaten the Republic enough to be elected chancellor, then granted emergency powers (that are not given up after the emergency is over).
  * Weaken / destroy the Separatist movement so that they are not a threat to the future Empire. Also decapitate their leadership, so that they don't try to rise up again for a good while.

  So, maybe it is clear in SW media that I haven't seen, but was Count Dooku a true believer that supported the Separatist cause, and was just getting played by Palpatine? Or was he in on the master plan the whole time, and was just disposed of when no longer needed? Did Dooku (and General Grievous) know that Palpatine was Darth Sidious all along? It seems like most of the rest of the Separatist leadership *did not* know that Palpatine was Sidious.

  3) Semi related question. So Palpatine didn't see fit to rest on his laurels at the conclusion of the Clone Wars and the acquisition of a new and powerful apprentice Darth Vader. He did commission the construction of a new superweapon, and further consolidate his power. But I can't help but think he was having a bit of ennui after all that, having accomplished the grand plan. I wonder if he thought much about retirement and an eventual successor. Of course he wasn't planning on dying any time soon. But while his apprentice was very strong with the force, I don't know that he was *ever* galactic emperor material. A great attack dog, sure, but there seemed to be a reason why he was somewhat outside the normal military chain of command.

  What was Palpatine's longer term plan for the Empire? What did he hope to accomplish next, or was power his only goal?  I'd read the heck out of a fan fic from the Emperor's PoV.

  - u/Dragongeek:
    ```
    Haven't read it, but absolutely agree on point 1. 

    Star Wars is fundamentally a fantasy story with wizards and sci-fi themed set decorations. The space combat, as described by Lucas, is basically WWII naval combat but in space. Everything is close enough that binoculars make sense, thick plates and steel are the order of the day, and massive amounts of crew are on the ships just doing ship things. 

    Talking about numbers, orbital dynamics, or velocities in anything more than an abstract sense like "ship A is faster than B because it has an upgraded turbo-encabulator" is a big no-no unless you want to open a huge can of worms and potentially dig your own grave trying to convert plot-derived-worldbuilding into something sensible.

    ```
    If I recall right Dooku was in on the plan and Palpatine was aiming for immortality.

    I'm pretty sure that Sublight Drive covers some of those questions if you read further.
    ```

    - u/ansible:
      ```
      I'm nearly caught up on Sublight Drive.

      I'm more curious about the prequel movies themselves, and what hints, if any exist, that Count Dooku knew the plan.

      While General Grievous sure liked killing Jedi, I don't think he planned to die for the Separatist cause, or lose the war in general.
      ```

      - u/gfe98:
        ```
        Episode 2 has Dooku tell Obi-Wan "What if I told you the Senate is under the control of a Sith Lord?" He also meets Sidious in person on Coruscant at the end, who addresses him as Darth Tyrannus. It is hard to imagine him not knowing the plan when his Master is the Supreme Chancellor and using the war to expand his powers.
        ```

        - u/ansible:
          ```
          Oh, I forgot about that bit.  It's been quite a while since I watched any of the prequels... I'm not actually sure if I've watched any of them more than once or twice.

          > Episode 2 has Dooku tell Obi-Wan "What if I told you the Senate is under the control of a Sith Lord?"

          In the estimated 3 years between Episode 2 and 3, it is a bit unfortunate that the Jedi never followed up on that admission. Either Palpatine was the Sith, or working with the Sith, if Dooku was to be believed.

          ------------

          It does make me wonder what Count Dooku's exit strategy for the war was. He was a very public figure, an ex-Jedi. Was he going to don a mask and just be Darth Tyrannus after the war?
          ```

          - u/ricree:
            ```
            If we assume that Dooku expected to be captured and imprisoned after the battle of Coruscant, the plan was probably that he'd sit in jail until the end of the war, after which he would be "graciously" freed and eventually gain a spot in the imperial administration.

            Iirc from Clone Wars / Legends, he was generally well respected by the galaxy at large and lent a lot of legitimaty to the separatists. Him as a prominent figure in the new empire probably disarms a fair chunk of lingering separatist sentiment after the rest of the leadership is taken out. In the end, though, obviously Palp wanted Vader more than all that.
            ```

  - u/Watchful1:
    ```
    Around a thousand years before the movies, there were roughly equal numbers of sith and jedi and they fought huge wars all the time. The sith had lots of problems with infighting and groups of less powerful sith teaming up to kill more powerful sith. A powerful sith named Darth Bane thought that was wrong and the only way to beat the jedi and rule the galaxy was for one sith to be the most powerful. He tricked all the other sith into killing themselves in a huge ritual and convinced the jedi they won the war, going into hiding himself.

    He then took an apprentice and told her that there should only ever be two sith, a master and apprentice. One powerful master and an apprentice to crave the power of the master. Eventually the apprentice would get powerful enough, kill the master and take their resources for themselves. Then they find their own apprentice and start over.

    This all continued with the masters secretly gaining political power and resources until eventually Darth Sidious manufactured the whole separatist crisis to con the republic into electing him chancellor, and eventually granting him the emergency powers he needed to stay ruler. And of course setting the jedi up to be split up and vulnerable enough to be killed by their own soldiers.

    So anyway, the whole point of the millennia long scheme was to kill all the jedi and rule the galaxy. Everything else was extra and the long term plan was basically just "rule the galaxy". We know Doku was Sidious's apprentice for years, since he used him to go buy the clone army. So Doku knew the plan all along and was hoping to eventually kill Sidious and take his place, long after the war and Sidious had cemented his power.

    Picking apprentices was more about finding someone powerful and with the right mindset for the dark side, not necessarily about whether they were a good politician.
    ```

  - u/Zurku:
    ```
    There is another hq fanfic about Star Wars on the site called " Star Wars: A Penumbral Path" and it honestly is very intriguing. It features 2 mc's with differing paths and a realistic look into the dark side. 

    Sadly the author lost himselves in the seems. It has the good old Problem of one Mc simply being more boring then the other and the author tries to fix it by focusing on that char more however just ends up creating a huge slowdown in pacing instead. 

    A real shame, because the story itself is really good. Perhaps try it out anyway, it does have 1k pages roughly
