## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  I'm really enjoying *The Witness* for the most part. It's a game that's very much about challenging your assumptions and taking in the world as it is rather than how you would like it to be. It's also filled to the brim with fiendishly difficult puzzles. So I second /u/xamueljones recommendation and think this is a worthy successor to *Braid*. I haven't finished the game yet, though I think I'm only a few hours away and will probably go for full completion, which will likely double my time.

  Also, today is my last day of work, after which I will be a stay-at-home dad (and ideally doing contract work and/or writing on the side). So that's neat.
  ```

    I have a somewhat different opinion of The Witness. I really like a lot of the game, but I don't feel it's perfect. I have played ~12 hours and [spoiler](#s "completed 7 lasers"), so while I haven't seen the entire game I feel I can render some sort of initial judgement on the game. I really like a lot of the game overall, and it seems really fun in many areas, but the problems that I have with it are significant enough to lower it from potential 10/10 to more like a 8/10 experience.

    1. It's now [Current Year], we should have options menues where we can adjust field of view sliders, graphics quality, resolution, etc. We shouldn't be forced to edit random text files in the game's folder with Notepad to adjust antialiasing levels. This shit is not acceptable in a $40 release. No, having 3 graphics quality options is not enough.

    2. The puzzles have a lot of neat mechanics, and they work together well when they mix multiple puzzle mechanics together. It's great. However, there are a HUGE number of puzzles after you understand the basic mechanic of an area just using that basic mechanic in more complicated ways, and in several areas they get boring like halfway through or even earlier. Ten of the same puzzle with extremely slight differences is not ten times as amazing as the first puzzle - and lots of areas don't limit themselves to small numbers of repetitions like 10. A lot of mechanics overstay their welcome in this game and become boring for me before I'm done all the puzzles. 

    3. The audio is all FUBAR for my PC. I get constant skipping and repeating of audio cues and audio logs. It would be a bigger deal in a game with more audio logs etc (I have found precisely 2 extensive audio logs in my ~12 hours of play). Some forum threads suggest killing audio software etc, and I haven't had any success with that - basically, I don't know why it's broken but it is and it made the two audio logs I listened to almost unbearably annoying. There are also segments of puzzles using sound that were much more difficult than they had any right to be because of this issue. Thank god there's no music and mostly not a huge number of ambient noises. 

    4. The lack of an ingame map [spoiler](#s "other than on the boat") is a giant nuisance for a game this sized. It's impossible to navigate the island without getting lost constantly for the first ~12 hours, and trying to find somewhere you've been before is a nightmare.
    ```

    - u/alexanderwales:
      ```
      The game is all about minimalism, and there are a few places where I think it hampers itself in pursuit of that goal. The lack of a map is definitely one of them. The lack of settings is another (though there are at least *some* mitigating reasons for that). I wouldn't give it a 10 either, especially not at the current price point. But it is a good game, especially if you like minimalist puzzlers.
      ```

    - u/Transfuturist:
      ```
      The lasers and the boat aren't spoilers, they're in the trailer.

      I consider the lack of a map display to be a good thing. I want more games with no maps, or at least maps embedded into the world with no game-model-breaking properties. The Pip-Boy is bad. The boat map is good.

      I won't disagree on having options menus, however, there's no real way around that without killing accessibility.

      The audio is a bug and you should report it. Number None is doing a lot of support work, so make use of it.
      ```

      - u/Escapement:
        ```
        Regarding maps: It doesn't necessarily have to be HUD-based maps - it could be other navigational aids as well. I recall, for example, The Talos Principle had no HUD-based obstructive maps at all, but I spent about 95% less time lost because they had *signs* up everywhere pointing you toward puzzles you had / had not solved (black marks through the puzzle reward on the sign to indicate you solved it already) so you could always find a new goal to work towards. Some signposts or other indicators would be a gigantic improvement. Even just putting the boat map on some boards with a 'you are here' in a bunch of prominent places inland would be super nice.

      Given the sheer brilliance of Braid (some disliked the inscrutability, but for me the story spoke on a deep level and the ambiguity adds to it and makes it more similar to the other true works of art I respect.

      Ouch! I feel for you. That's why I haven't switched to a Mac yet, because I have so many cool Windows-only games and software.

      Does anyone know how hard it is to export games from Windows to Mac/Linux? I don't know too much about programming games and I constantly see games being offered on only one platform while others are offered on every platform imaginable. So how hard is it versus making the game itself?

        The recorded market share for Linux gaming (which I don't believe accounts for things like WINE or dual-boot) on Steam is less than 1%. If the effort to support Linux is non-negligible, then it will be neglected. From @cmuratori, the initial porting isn't the problem. The problem is the testing, maintenance, and support.

        Jon says Mac is more likely.

  What do you guys think about [Google AI beat european go champion](http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-35420579)?

  I wouldn't say the writing is -that- good, but the direction is really really good. It really manages to get you into the mood of what is going on in the story, and to connect to the characters.

    ```
    >What do you guys think about Google AI beat european go champion? is the breakthrough really about go, or about GAI?

    Neither but both.

    The breakthrough is in *general* models and algorithms that can be *trained* for arbitrary specific tasks.  So-called "transfer learning", re-using training data/experience from one task to pre-train for another, is still considered an open problem in which comparatively few advancements have been made.

    Further, there isn't a consensus on *why* these "deep learning" models work as well as they do, as there are several different hypotheses as to why and most of them aren't very, shall we say, *predictive*, in the sense of being able to tell you ahead of time when deep learning should work and when it shouldn't.

    I'm partisan to one of those theories, and it also tells us a lot about transfer learning, but it's going to take a few good experiments and a theoretical paper to actually cover the ground.

        To me that sounds like hype based on a misunderstanding of how research advances and a desire to market their achievement as bigger than it really is.

        > is this just transferable to other fields, i.e. could the advancements be used to play any arbitrary board game? game?

        Yes and yes.

          It definitely sounds like hyping on the one hand, but on the other so will a real advancement that is a decade ahead of time. 
          The question is can you evaluate the development and actually judge that it is an over statement or is it just well placed skepticism?

          I saw EY seems to think its a big deal from the thread on SSC, but I am not sure if its a principle thing or a technical thing. and it seems a lot of people over there think he is overreacting.

  I'm brainstorming a scifi story with alien races that have some common traits with humans because of convergent evolution. I am interested in the question of which features we are most likely / least likely to share with an intelligent alien race given similar primordial soups. (E.g. Earth mammals having five fingers seems just an accident of common ancestry, but eyes keep cropping up in unrelated species and often drift towards the human model.) 

  This sounds like the sort of topic there must be a lot of fun articles about; I would appreciate any recommendations.
  ```

  - u/Sparkwitch:
    ```
    I too would love to see more articles about this, but in the meantime I'm happy to speculate:

    **A Brain, Familiar Senses, and a Head**
    It's nice to limit the distance your nervous system must extend, and centralization has huge advantages. A brain centralizes thinking, minimizing thought time, and clumping as many sense organs as possible around that nerve center keeps reaction times low. Light and sound are omnipresent in most liveable environments. The molecular analysis of taste and smell are crucial for basic dietary reasons. Touch, temperature, balance, and proprioception would all be familiar mental concepts whether the aliens had specific devoted organs for those senses or not.

    There's no reason any of these senses necessarily need to share (or not to share) the particular holes we happen to use.

    **Arms and Hands**:
    You're right about not necessarily needing five fingers, but it is extremely important to have dexterous many-pronged instruments on the end of relatively strong limbs not used in general locomotion. The ability to manipulate and to carry seems an important step towards what we think of as intelligence.

    Contrast the difficulties that crows, elephants, octopuses, and dolphins encounter with such interactions. They might be uplifted to technological competency, or provided with prosthetic versions, but their own innovations will have a hard time getting far with such limited physical ability to experiment.

    **Bilateral Symmetry**:
    Binocular vision and binaural hearing have huge advantages in conceptually-2D land based life. Limbs in pairs have a lot of locomotive advantages. Given the importance of arms, the whole "two arms, two legs" thing might not even be that unusual. Fewer is inconvenient, more is a waste of energy.

    **Omnivorous**:
    Energy is important.

    Generally speaking, the fewer things a creature eats the less it has to think about what it's eating. Conveniently, the more things that a creature eats the less energy it has to spend digesting and the more that can be devoted to thinking.

    It turns out flexible minds are expensive, but so are the sorts of vibrant guts that can turn a single food source into all the myriad proteins necessary to sustain life.

    The smartest herbivores *can and must* eat a wide variety of plants which supply different nutrients, the smartest carnivores *can and must* eat the largest variety of animals. That dietary/intellectual spectrum has shown up in animals as diverse as arthropods, molluscs and mammals, so it would be no surprise if it existed in unconnected evolutionary trees.
    ```

      Thank you for this.

      > it is extremely important to have dexterous **many-pronged** instruments on the end of relatively strong limbs

      Why many-pronged? Couldn't a tentacle of some sort (with either good strength or a rugged / sticky / sucking surface, so that it can grip) be good enough for advanced tool use? [Octopuses seem to do okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DoWdHOtlrk), if you account for their weak boneless grip.

      I was not aware. This is really interesting, and exactly the kind of insight I was looking for.
      ```

      - u/Sparkwitch:
        ```
        An octopus tentacle is arguably multi-pronged: They have individual control of each suction cup. It can grasp exactly as much or as little as it cares to, and by that definition considerably more than half an octopus's surface area is hand.

        What it's missing are *arms*, with lifting strength and distinction from locomotive use.
        ```

        - u/Nighzmarquls:
          ```
          Also there are birds with independently posable beak segments. if you include a tongue in that you could make a case for a bird having three 'prongs' to manipulate objects and tools.

          I challenged myself to making a quadrupedal crocodilian tool user. They developed tool use via their jaw muscles and used tongue+variety of teeth and jaw postures to manipulate tools. Their forelegs acted as proping/grasping and the long/strong appendage factor was fulfilled by a muscular and flexible neck.
          Their tool use occured as an offshoot of nest building/manipulation and the invention of fire and cooperative social interaction allowed for more precise control of the heat distribution in their nests, which gave their females a way to control depending on environmental conditions the genders of their offspring.

          sexual selection became a highly social game and sons/daughters and ready access to burnable fuels along side aquacultures of usable fish and general environmental challenges eventually created industrial revolution.

          Their version of population labor opening up from necessry work was the creation of electrically heated nest beds (an offshoot of their more kiln like 'traditional' nests) and eventually caused much social, political and economical upheaval.

          then some one built a GAI out of video game and everyone got raptured and is arguably dead.

          If you want to use any of that particular species' traits feel free.

    ```
    If you don't have something exotic like a genetic memory or telepathy through skin contact, then I would expect aliens to have a long childhood and some sort of protectiveness towards their young.

    Because the main drawback of intelligence is just how long it takes to learn everything you need to know without it being hard-coded in as instincts. Hence there must be some sort of lengthy learning phase and the species needs to have good protection for their young during this period of life.
    ```

  - u/Iconochasm:
    ```
    Some method of fine manipulation.  Not necessarily opposable thumbs, but something similar enough to allow precision in tool crafting and use.

    Sexual dimophism also seems like a plausible candidate, both for the rapidity of mutation, and as a way for the species to compete internally, while still allowing for wide-scale cooperation.

    It would be interesting to see some of those species lack some of those common features, and explore what that difference would entail.  How does the intelligent solitary predator compare to intelligent group hunter-gatherers?

  So I've recently been presented with something of a difficult situation. I was having a conversation with one of my professors, someone I respect and care about. I've known they had a serious condition of some kind since last year but I found out its specific nature. It's a genetic issue often abbreviated as MERRF, basically the mitochondria in their body just begin dying and this causes their entire body to slowly degrade. There isn't a cure, and I don't think there will be until gene therapy advances significantly.

  It's something that acts very slowly as far as incurable fatal diseases go. I don't know, I just wanted to share this with some folks that don't tend towards fatalism. I'm not really sure what I'm asking for, it's just a really unfair situation.

  Feel free to ask for more information, although I might decline to answer since I'm not sure how much it would be appropriate to share.

  Question for those of you in romantic relationships: Is your partner a rationalist as well? If not, do you ever find yourself having difficulty with them on certain things, due to you favoring a rational viewpoint over the viewpoint she prefers (a societal based one, an emotion based one, etc.)

  For example, I could see the concept of "the one" causing friction in a relationship. As in, you don't believe in the concept, whereas your partner may be convinced that you are "the one" and is hurt by your reciprocating her belief. 


  Also any general notes about how you found rationality impacting your relationship ( If it does at all) would be cool. I'm just speaking as a curious, single person.

  Edit: sorry in advance for typos. On mobile :(

  Edit2: ~~I'm obviously only talking to M/F coup-~~ Alright, let's end that there. In all seriousness, this post was primarily written with heterosexual couples in mind, simply because I'm a heterosexual and have the most experience with heterosexual relationships (from a viewer's standpoint anyway) No offense meant to non-heterosexual relationships, feel free to comment, regardless of what relationship you're in, as long as it's a romantic (though not necessarily sexual, you asexuals you!) one!

    My wife isn't a rationalist, but she tends to be *sensible*, which gets her most of the way there and is all I really need. We have a fair division of labor around the house, we thank each other for the small things, there aren't many points of friction where an argument could develop, etc. She takes correction well and I try my best to do the same. There's not much that we disagree on, or that we can't talk out with each other; there's nothing intractable and there are no recurring fights.

    So no, no impacts at all. She's great.

    >Question for those of you in romantic relationships: Is your partner a rationalist as well?

    My fiancee dislikes LW culture and harbors genuine resentment and hatred over much of HPMoR.  I also took her to LW-TA meetings sometimes and she liked the people there.

    She doesn't follow the community, but very much considers an active practice of *good sense*, grounded in science and evidence, to be an absolutely essential part of life.

    The fact that she deeply dislikes many societal norms and doesn't want to trust emotions that might derive from an active mental illness are big spurs towards that view.

    Also, if she were here, she'd be telling me to beat you over the head about "emotion-based viewpoints" not being necessarily irrational, blah blah Straw Vulcan, blah blah.  I concur.

    Like the others who commented, my GF isn't a "rationalist" and couldn't get into HPMOR, though she did give it an honest shot (not even my remixed version helped ;_;). That said, she's an exceedingly intelligent person who is studying biochemistry and programming, so she's more rational than the majority of people.

    **That said,** we argue occasionally about things like whether her love for me is "stronger" because it's more emotional and less logical (neither of us believe in "the one," but two people loving each other exactly the same amount seems improbable), or some differences of opinion that can mostly be chalked up to her being more "traditional" or "conservative" in certain regards. 

    Every relationship has disagreements, however, and the most important thing is how we react to them. We've always tried to treat each other with respect, and have commented on how grateful we are that the other is an intelligent and rational person that we can disagree on big issues without it causing resentment. Best of all, we've changed each other's minds on a number of things, which is really the best you can ask for in a partner: for them to logically challenge your beliefs and help you learn.

    [Braid](http://braid-game.com/). Gorgeous, clever, doesn't outstay its welcome.

    Also: [XCOM](http://store.steampowered.com/sub/37429/) is really cheap right now (and XCOM 2 comes out next week and seems strictly better). It isn't like any of the games on your list so I can't tell for sure if you'll like it, but an *excellent* strategy game with AAA production values for £5 is certainly worth a try.

          It's against Steam's TOS to pretend to be in a different country (precisely because of that price discrimination) and Steam does its best to make it inconvenient. Use at your own risks.

          Being an old, popular indie game, Braid frequently gets discounts and bundles though. Patient gamers can get it for much less than $15.

    #Puzzle Games: 

    Antichamber is a great puzzle experience. It's very minimalistic in terms of story (almost no story), it's basically 100% first-person puzzles. The game has a bunch of noneuclidean space and stuff that's really neat. It's got really good puzzles, though, and will keep you occupied for a few hours without overstaying it's welcome. It's sort of expensive at full price for what it is, but is old enough to be on sale frequently. Completion time: ~8-10 hours.

    Braid is, as everyone else says, a wonderful 2d puzzle game. It's totally worth picking up, even at full price, but also goes on sale frequently. Fairly short game (~4-5 hours at most, probably less).

    The Swapper is a great puzzle game with a few interesting ideas about identity, the ship of theseus problem, consciousness, etc. It's got a fairly minimalist plot, but absolutely gorgeous aesthetics - everything in the entire game looks great. Completion time: ~5 hours.

    The Talos Principle. It's got a neat mixture of portal-like first person puzzles with a gorgeous ruined civilization aesthetic, and a storyline that is surprisingly engaging. There is a lot of philosophical questions and stuff in The Talos Principle, but they're mostly not terribly sophisticated. Still more interesting than most videogames. A really fun puzzle game. There's a lot of secrets and hidden easter eggs, but even without those a full playthrough takes a long time. 

    QUBE: First person puzzles are pretty great, but game is short and fairly easy. Almost no plot, almost no replay value (worse than any of the other games in this list in terms of secrets and replay value). Get on sale, don't pay full price. ~3 hours. 

    #Non-Puzzle Games

    Go play the Stanley Parable Demo. If you like it, you will love the game and it will be well worth your money for it's ~4 hours of play. If you don't like the demo, don't pick up the game. The demo doesn't spoil the game at all, but at the same time is the best possible explanation of what the game will be like - I *strongly* recommend the free demo, even if you are convinced you will enjoy the game there is a lot of demo-only content you should see.

    Dishonored: My single favorite game of recent years. It's got a neat plot, and gameplay similar to the Thief games - that is, stealth-FPS with looting, evading guards, etc. Only, you get magical powers to teleport and stuff. It's got a number of levels to explore in the course of missions which feel very big and are very complicated, it's got some replayability (two paths you can take that have meaning - low chaos and high chaos), and it's just a ton of fun, some of the most fun I've had in a game recently. The story is competent but not amazing for the most part - the actual main plot is decent, but all the optional quests, recorded sound journals, and other noncentral stuff is really amazing and brings the whole world to life.

      I second pretty much every puzzle game just mentioned here.

      The only ones missing are [Fez](http://store.steampowered.com/app/224760/) and [Limbo](http://playdead.com/limbo/).

      Fez is an awesome puzzling game where a 2-D character learns to move between 2-D slices of a 3-D world.

      Limbo is a fairly simple puzzling game where a young boy has to survive monsters stalking him and reach important levers and switches to reunite with his sister. It's one of the most brilliant blend of environmental puzzles and story telling I have seen.

    HyperRogue is a pretty great mind-bending roguelike. Casual play is simple, but coming to a deeper understanding of what's going on over many playthroughs will necessarily and easily teach you advanced mathematical concepts pertaining to non-Euclidean geometry. As of yet it has no story, but on the mind-bending front I'd certainly compare it to Portal. It's regularly updated with new areas.

    I've played over one thousand hours of *[Europa Universalis 4](http://store.steampowered.com/app/236850)* (mostly with the *MEIOU & Taxes* mod) and almost 750 hours of *[Crusader Kings 2](http://store.steampowered.com/app/203770)* (mostly with the *Historical Improvement Project* mod). These historical grand-strategy games are entirely different from the *Civilization* games, since they're inherently asymmetrical right from the start, and they actually aim for historical accuracy ([especially with the mods](http://np.reddit.com/r/paradoxplaza/comments/42atyf/amazingly_cool_plans_for_the_next_totally_awesome/)). They're also ridiculously easy for a player to modify for himself, since most of the game files are in plain text. However, they can be a little expensive if not gotten on sale, since each game requires about a zillion expansions (lists: [EU4](http://www.eu4wiki.com/Downloadable_content#Expansions), [CK2](http://www.ckiiwiki.com/Downloadable_content#Expansions)) for the full experience. (See also r/ParadoxPlaza, r/EU4, and r/CrusaderKings.)

    *[Hexcells](http://store.steampowered.com/app/265890)* is a nice, cheap combination of Minesweeper and Picross/Nonograms.

    *[Downwell](http://store.steampowered.com/app/360740)* is a fun and cheap little action game.

    *[Burnout Paradise](http://store.steampowered.com/app/24740)* is pretty fun.

      I like Crusader Kings 2 a lot, but the learning curve is a cliff face ~~(and by all accounts it's the simplest one)~~.

      You definitely don't need "the full experience" aka all the DLCs. Many are overpriced cosmetic, and even the gameplay ones mostly just increase replayability of an already very very replayable game. I'd recommend starting with the vanilla game only unless there's some crazy discount. (Alas, the autumn-winter Steam sales season is behind us.)

        > I like Crusader Kings 2 a lot, but the learning curve is a cliff face (and by all accounts it's the simplest one).

        I'm under the impression that, between *EU4* and *CK2*, EU4 is the one considered by players to be the simplest, most "map-painting"-oriented game. Certainly, though, I haven't played vanilla in years, so I'm probably quite out of touch.

          EU4 is the simpler one. You only play a nation. In CK2 you play a lineage of individuals.

        Yes, I'd definitely recommend the purchase of EU4 at this price.

        The list of actually-important DLC (as opposed to the minor content packs) is [here](http://www.eu4wiki.com/Downloadable_content#Expansions). In my opinion, [Art of War](http://www.eu4wiki.com/Art_of_War) (HRE league wars, revolution targets, client states), [El Dorado](http://www.eu4wiki.com/El_Dorado) (custom starting nations, exploration missions), and [Common Sense](http://www.eu4wiki.com/Common_Sense) (subject interactions, government ranks) are the most important expansions. (checks Steam) Oh, and how convenient--those are exactly the expansions on 66%-off sales.

    The Binding of Isaac (Rebirth) is a good Rougelike. It's very light on story, but it's got a great deal of replayability. A game takes 30-90 minutes to finish, and everything is randomly generated (Within certain parameters, of course; one shop per floor, with random stuff in it, one treasure room, one boss).

    Every playthrough is different, because there are hundreds of different items you can come across, and they all have weird synergies with each other. It's not an intellectual game, but there is planning ahead and experimentation to be done, and you'll never have two identical runs.

    There is *some* story stuff to figure out, as well as the mystery of how to unlock things, so if you haven't played it before I recommend staying away from spoilers, at least until you have cleared a 10 floor playthrough.

    Rebirth is the same game as just The Binding of Isaac, but bigger and better, so no reason to play the vanilla version unless you can get it for free somewhere.

    I'm curious if you change your mind about undertale after finishing it, then FINISHING IT.

    If nothing else when your feeling done and unspoilable on it the phenomena surrounding that game is worth looking at. I have seen some really useful breakdowns of how it used psychological aspects of human experience to improve how it is received.

    Good writing fodder.

    Just binge-watched the first season this week, and once you get past the usual frustration of irrational characters, it's immensely entertaining. Obviously the pill doesn't actually make you any smarter - it just gives you massive amounts of processing power.

    I love Brian's narration and general sense of humor, and the plot isn't lacking in things to keep me interested. Looking forward to season 2.

    It took it some time to find its footing and develop its voice. I'd never have thought that the show as it existed in the pilot would have become the wild, energetic, off-the-wall show that it is now. I think the silliness really works for it though and helps to distinguish it. The power of NZT is about as variable as the plot demands, but I think it's got enough charm to make up for that.

  Do you ever write in reverse for fun?

  ---

  I find it fairly enjoyable, myself ([original image](http://i.imgur.com/96PThIF.png), [reversed image](http://i.imgur.com/pvk5Yy8.png); [text source](http://www.jabberwocky.com/carroll/jabber/jabberwocky.html))--it really forces the writer to *think* about the shapes of the letters. For example, the letter `d` doesn't have a *leftward* bulge--rather, it must be considered as having a protrusion *opposite to the direction of writing,* or the writer will constantly mix it up with `b`. Likewise, `q` in reversed cursive takes a fair amount of thought to execute correctly.

I can only hope that my mental model of what Yudkowsky and [Bruce Schneier](https://www.schneier.com/) could come up with if they collaborated is accurate enough that no Willing Suspension of Disbelief will be necessary.

      metamore is the significant other of my significant other who is not my significant other.

      It is a good idea to be on cordial if not pleasant terms with one's metamores but the relationship is not the 'same' as with one who might be with your 'loved' ones.

      I'm Asexual, my SO is pretty much pan, [we fight crime...](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyFightCrime) I mean it's interesting and complicated and wonderful and there is probably three tumblrs worth of complexity and weird terminology that could be used to describe how this works out.
