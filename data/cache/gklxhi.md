  There's an Orson Scott Card novel called *The Worthing Saga* that explores this more deeply. Both great stories.

  A short story about cryonics and its interaction with the stock market.

  ```
  That was a cute one.

  I guess this is a type of immorality. Get something that would kill you, take the sleep.  So its kinda waiting till heat death.  But you also have to balance your time in sleep vs your stocks to produce the most happy life.

    One thing I considered getting into but cut for space is that there's some inherent  risk the whole system collapses while you're asleep.  It's a lot easier to be confident in going to sleep for one year or ten years than for a millennium.  So I would guess most people would sleep repeatedly for brief periods unless they got a terminal illness, which also gives you clear chunks of time to enjoy your earnings while you're learning enough about the world to figure out whether to go under again.

      ```
      If one gets a terminal illness, should they wake up whenever *a* decent cure exists or should they wait until there is a guaranteed and easy cure?
      ```

        ```
        There's a problem where everyone wants the perfect cure, but if no one wakes up to take it there isn't enough test subjects; it's possible that the never frozen humans get the same disease and act as the first line of test subjects, but if it's something like lead poisoning where prevention is easier than the cure you might end up with a million who refuse to be the first out stuck in limbo.

        Likely they would just wake up a bunch and ask them anyways, I'm sure enough would want to come out once the problem is explained. Longterm, it'll likely be set up that the lowest risk cases are required to be unfrozen first. And anyways, as long as the cure doesn't cause e.g. irreparable nervous system damage they can just be frozen again, plus an additional problem.

          Realistically speaking, at some point advances in other fields will let humans armed with ai systems get exponential growth in medical knowledge/ability to manipulate human bodies.  That is, I am saying we'll have the current glacial progress continue for some unknown number of decades, and then there will be robotic systems that can be mass manufactured to do bioscience research on enormous scales.

          Kind of how the early computers did more math than every human combined up to that point in human history.  Millions of robotic lab units that objectively investigate biology, from the ground up, building a model as they go from the data, without human bias and with automated replication of results, would learn more than all human efforts to this point.

          With that kind of knowledge - after a few decades of progress at this pace - presently living humans could be kept that way essentially forever, so long as they promptly receive treatment and aren't harmed in a way that destroys their brain.  Cryo patients would take longer to recover - enormous advances in nanotechnology required - and bringing them back as "living" flesh and blood beings might or might not ever be possible.
