## [BST] Illusion Magic

### Post:

The power to turn something that looks identical or nearly identical to another thing and actually turn it into the other thing. This system will need good restrictions of course, but what are some good applications? It would be weaker against multiple observers and it would be harder to use without prep than most magic systems but with prep I think it could be pretty powerful.

One possible restriction in need of rephrasing: you can't change something that isn't observed by anyone. No changing a closed empty box into the same closed empty box containing the cure to cancer, or even a bar of gold.

edit: In its current form this is too powerful. I'm looking for good, interesting restrictions. Applications too.

  There's a Brandon Sanderson novella *The Emperor's Soul* that uses a somewhat similar system of magic. There the magic isn't about *observation*, it's about histories, so you can take a crappy vase and put a stamp on it that will turn it into a really awesome vase. The more similar the two things are, the easier it is to switch from one to the other. (I personally think that story is one of the best things that Sanderson has written.)

    To take one example from the novel, the protagonist is in a dull, drab room in a palace. She uses the magic to change the room's history, so that a famous painter who once stayed nearby in the palace actually stayed in the room and painted it, making the room beautifully painted and decorated

  But you can paint the box yellow and *then* turn it into gold, yeah? Or a sugar pill into, if not a cancer cure, at least an *actual* pill? Or a toy computer into a real computer, containing software that people already know about?

  One good restriction is probably that the size and weight of the object shouldn't change. Otherwise you can send up a yellow balloon or something and end up with a second star.

    Basically, yes, if you paint it well. The mana cost is proportional to the difference in appearance.

  Can it depend on perspective?  If so, there's some pretty neat tricks you can pull.  IIRC Disneyland has a road leading up to a castle, and all of the trees get progressively smaller the closer they are to it.  This gives the illusion that the trees are all the same size and the castle is very big and far away.

  Somewhat offtopic: if this is an actual transformation, how is it illusion magic?

  Ontopic: How different can the objects be?  Can I turn:

  * A Toyota Camry into a Formula 1 racecar?
  * The prop Batmobile from the 60s campy Batman into a real Batmobile with atomic turbines that can then be reverse engineered?
  * A prop from any movie set into the real thing?  If so, hurrah for transporters, FTL spacecraft, FTL communications and basically anything else because I can write movies that include whatever I want.
  * A picture of something into the real thing?  
  * A hologram of something into the real thing?
  * A life-sized painted 3-D model of something into the real thing?

  This was my first thought, yeah.

  What's the important difference between a box containing a cure to cancer and a box containing circuitry (a computer)? Or a solid gold "box" containing gold - that is, a gold bar? I'm not sure what the distinction is, so I can't munchkin it.
