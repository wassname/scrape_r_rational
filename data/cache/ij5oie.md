  Ask him for 2 or 3 of his favorite quotes from a story and get it printed on a mug or T-shirt.

  Uhhh.. hmmm. Rational fiction is kinda niche. There aren't a lot of things in the genre.  Maybe some xkcd swag or kurzgesagt  is he into either of those?? What computer games does he like, there's gear associated with those.

  ...is this me? I don’t recognize OP’s user name...


  Though, I do have to wonder if it’s just a coincidence of birthdays. I’d imagine the odds of me sharing a list of interests with someone else on this sub is significantly higher than anywhere else on the internet. 

  I’m tempting to leave a list of things I’d like, just in case.

  But then again, if it is me, I wouldn’t want to influence the selection process. 

  Decisions, decisions...

  This might sound sappy, but: one of the best gifts you can give a friend with a niche interest, is to get into that same niche interest. If they're anything like the average rational-fiction reader, they likely don't know any other people (in person, at least) who they can talk to about what they read. Outside of a few places (e.g. the SF Bay Area), our community is still *very* small!

  For them, you could be that person. Ask your friend for some rational-fiction recommendations, read them, and talk to your friend about them!

  Mind you, the thing that'd make this a "gift", is that you'd put in a bit of effort in doing this: you'd push yourself through and keep reading, even if you hit an initial stumbling-block of the kind that'd *normally* make you give up on a story — like the story using lots of words you don't know when you don't normally want to read stories like that, or the story doing something that's not to your taste. You'd keep faith that your friend saw *something* good in the book, and recommended it to you for a reason. So you'd power through,

  I can't speak for your friend, but personally I would appreciate this gift a lot! Certainly more than, like, socks. (And I love me some socks.)

  This is a hard question to answer. Especially because I haven't read either series. The quotes printed on something is a good one and probably better than the suggestion I am about to make. I only make it because it's general advice for gifting for anyone who likes video games.

  If you have access to his steam / wish-list (I'll note that this can be as innocuous as asking to friend him on steam) that might give you an idea of the games he plays, likes, and wants (this works well for anyone with a steam account I find). It could be as simple as buying something from that list (steam has gifting features), though not everyone uses that list for actual things they want (sometimes just things they like, or want to pay attention to) so be careful.

  Of course to make it more personal one would have to look through that profile and pick something that you have played and think he will like based off of your experience that is related to what he likes (e.g. has a lot of hours played on; this can also be useful in narrowing down a wishlist). Which is not really something **I** can do. Given his interests I suspect he has likely purchased a lot of the games he does like and is aware of games like Factorio and the [Zachtronics](https://store.steampowered.com/publisher/zachtronics) *puzzle* games (and not so much their non-puzzle offerings) - which both have lots of critical acclaim and are relatively safe recommends (even people who end up not thinking it's their cup of tea still tend to review the games positively and dump at least a dozen hours into them before hitting their limit). And anything beyond that would be too personal/subjective on my end for recommending.

  Cash.

  I know this sounds impersonal, but it's econ 101 that cash gifts are the most valuable to their recipients.  That way, they can spend them on whatever they really wanted.

  But if that feels silly to you, then lots of folks who are into rational fiction are also into effective altruism, so you could make a donation in his name to Givewell's top-rated charity instead.

  Maybe a custom printed t-shirt using some art from his favorite series. Like [this](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51qzuPNcLVL.jpg) or [this](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/4a/b2/a7/4ab2a7029fedaf3ff8beee1e5ca52cf7.png) with some editing. Or maybe [this t-shirt](https://ih1.redbubble.net/image.208346172.3937/ssrco,classic_tee,mens,heather_grey,front_alt,square_product,600x600.u2.jpg) for an inside joke if he's a fan of SlateStarCodex.

  Or just get him a game. Plenty of new releases. Baldur's Gate 3 early access is coming out in September. The Outer Worlds was recently recommended here and has DLC releasing soon.

  Desk toys.

  Like wooden blocks that have magnets in them and clack so satisfyingly. 

  Random stuff you can mess with and read at the same time.

    I am incredibly disappointed after looking at that link. Not one Valley-of-the-Wind-themed item

    - u/misanthropokemon:
      ```
      Yeah Ghibli-san might take issue with that
      ```

  HPMOR?
