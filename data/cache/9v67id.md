## [D] Characters Who Are Smarter Than You Are (Writing Excuses podcast)

### Post:

>*Many of us write characters who know more than we know, and/or who think faster than we do. Writing those characters is tricky. In this episode we talk about our own tricks, and the tricks we’ve seen others use.*

[Episode link](https://writingexcuses.com/2018/10/28/13-43-characters-who-are-smarter-than-you-are/) | [Text Transcript](https://wetranscripts.dreamwidth.org/149327.html)

This 25-minute episode of Writing Excuses features Howard Tayler (Schlock Mercenary), Mary Robinette Kowal (The Calculating Stars, Ghost Talkers), Dan Wells (I Am Not a Serial Killer, Partials), and Amal El-Mohtar (Seasons of Glass and Iron).

My notes on several points brought up in this episode:

* Seeing a character's thought process as they come up with possible ideas, reason through them, and reject the bad ideas finally arriving at a brilliant conclusion can actually make them appear smarter than if we just skipped to the part where they come up with a brilliant conclusion.  Sherlock Holmes doesn't just tell us who the culprit is; he also explains how he deduced the answer.
* You can treat logic or competence within a specific domain the same way you might treat a hard magic system.  As Brandon Sanderson's first law tells us, "an author's ability to solve conflict with magic is directly proportional to how well the reader understands said magic."  Likewise, an author's ability to solve conflict with logic is directly proportional to how well the reader understands that logic.  (Applies to any kind of intellectual discipline: "smart" characters can solve problems with math, chemistry, their knowledge of information technology systems, etc.)
* An advantage that authors have over real-world geniuses: most real-world problem-solving involves starting with a problem, and then trying to come up with a (hopefully brilliant, but often merely adequate) solution.  When writing a story, you can start with a brilliant solution, then come up with a problem that corresponds to that brilliant solution.  This tends to be how heist stories are written: first, we decide that we want one of the members of our heist team to be a demolitions expert; that then requires that part of the heist involves facing a problem that requires the use of explosives.

  > So, Max Gladstone and I have co-written a novella that is coming out in probably… I think it's… Probably, I think it's July 2019. It's a book of two dueling time traveling super spies. One written by Max and one written by me. I have a number of insecurities in this regard because, first of all, I mean, they're time traveling super spies, they have all of time and space at their disposal, they are the best there… They are the best there are at what they do. But Wolverine quote, "And what they do is not very nice." Etc. So, they're brilliant, and they're constantly outsmarting each other and one upping each other. I am not a time traveling superspy.

  Wow, I've had the same premise in the back of my head for years, but I could never think of an interesting story to tell or coherent way to synch the timelines such that neither side of the conflict got immediately wiped from existence; I'll certainly be looking at this.

    Yup. Time travel is difficult. You have to have a setup where a smart, ruthless character couldn't simply jump back in time as far as possible and control everything which happened subsequently, or jump back in time and tinker with their opponent's time travel gear/ability from the start, or erase their opponent from history, or jump back to *themselves* and give themselves ALL the advantages from the start (or do it sneakily if there are fixed loops or paradoxes).

    The whole thing has to be solid in four dimensions and logical from the viewpoint of each character at any given moment in their personal timeline. It's not easy to come up with a scenario which supports that, unless you have restrictions like "the time machine only works when it's convenient to the plot".

      One way in which this can be done is to have the antagonist and the protagonist turn out to be the same person, with the future version either suffering from amnesia or carefully grooming his past self to become him...

      And that can be a pretty significant twist, but has to be done carefully.
      ```

      - u/Geminii27:
        ```
        True. It's a half-expected plot twist in this day and age; it'd have to be done really well and/or maybe have an additional twist in there somewhere. Maybe the antagonist isn't actually a single future self, but two (or even three) possible selves, fighting to gain control of which of them the current protagonist will become.
        ```

        - u/CCC_037:
          ```
          Yeah, it's hard but not impossible to have multiple time-travelling agents in the same story.

          One example which handles this well is HPMoR, in which nothing (not even information) can time-travel more than six hours into the past, and trying to take too much advantage of time travel tends to lead to trouble ("DO NOT MESS WITH TIME").

          Another example that's well-handled is the time travel arc in PS238 - there's actually multiple time travel arcs, with the same events seen from the perspective of first the protagonist, then (not in the same order) by a time-travelling antagonist, and both of them make perfect sense from their character's personal points of view (and also, they most certainly are not the same person).
          ```

            > in which nothing (not even information) can time-travel more than six hours into the past

            It's weird and kinda inconsistent. It can but it also can't. If it was a hard limit, then there could be only one time traveler in the world at any given time. If there were at least two and they, say, passed by one another on the street without talking, their bodies would surely exchange all sort of information - infrared photons, dust, particles of skin and hair if they bumped into one another, various chemicals one of them exhaled and another one inhaled, gravitational waves, etc, etc, etc. A sufficiently good analyzer then could deduce the fact of their meeting (and the state either of them was in during the meeting) just by observing one of them, which could allow them to receive information from further ahead than 6 hours.

            What actually seems to be happening is that only information that someone consciously tries to use can't travel into the past. So that whole stuff about hair being exchanged would lead to a paradox if and only if there is a DNA analyzer nearby that intends to check one of them for hair and use that information to deduce information from 6+ hours into the future. Which, fair enough, a lot of magic seems consciousness - focused, maybe magic is a grumpy GM that slaps down any mage that tries to go above 6 the hour limit. But that's not, in principle, an inherent limit of the laws, it seems.

      I think a well-hidden dead man's switch in the past set to cause catastrophic consequences were it to go untriggered would suffice to ensure neither side was wiped from the timeline. However, it'd have to be a "natural" deadman's switch, so that its creation wouldn't be butterflied away by whatever event undoes the existence of the rival agency. It's difficult to imagine how an equilibrium like that could come into existence, how either agency would stumble on some deviation from the original timeline they'd consider mission critical to maintain, that'd simultaneously be secret from their opposition, that wouldn't incidentally be destroyed by all the other mucking about they're doing in times predating that point.

      Another possibility is to make them sister splinters of the same original agency, such that changes to one's origins destabilize the others', although this obviously has holes. Similarly, each side has moles in the other's agency, then whenever one group is wiped out a remnant of the other would always be able to rebuild the opposition. But that's highly unstable. Figuring out how to make the deadman's switch work seems like the most promising avenue.

      There's also the problem that two people traveling in time "simultaneously" makes very little sense. One of them has to trump the other. That it's much less clear how to begin getting a handle on. You could perhaps do an endless back-and-forth, but I think it'd seem contrived.
      ```

      - u/Geminii27:
        ```
        Maybe something along the lines of the time travel isn't controlled by the protagonist/antagonist, but instead by the politics of whatever agency they work for? Although a smart agent should, in theory, also be able to influence that...

        Maybe a time-travel agency which has taken its own existence outside the 'core' timeline (if such a thing could be said to exist), so it can't be retroactively interfered with because the events leading up to its creation no longer exist anyway?
        ```

    Seems like the easiest start would be for neither protagonist to know who the other is.  The first one would be going about their life, using their powers successfully, when one day events that they’re rehearsed in a loop failed to work, because the loop changed.  This alerts them both that there’s another traveller, but any attempts they make to find each other alter events, which makes it impossible to plan a trap for the other.

    The really smart stuff would come out of solving that seemingly-impossible situation.

    - u/hyphenomicon:

      I think you're drawing too much from the constraints of Mother of Learning. There's no reason they'd share a synchronized loop.

  It's also important to recognize when you *shouldn't* have smart characters. I binged watched the first 3 seasons of Buffy, and the thing that constantly stood out in my mind (aside from "Willow and Oz are such a cute couple!") was how dumb everyone was. At one point we learn Evil Angel has been sneaking into Buffy's room at night and drawing her, as part of an evil taunting thing. To which my response was "Wait, *what*? Buffy has known a centuries old monster has been out to kill her personally for months now, and she is just now thinking about home security? Are you SERIOUS!?". 

  But the thing is the point of the show is to be a metaphor for normal teenage girl problems, and Evil Angel is a metaphor for a stalker ex boyfriend. So Buffy being smart and placing garlic in her window, or making all her friends carry crosses and holy water on them at all times, would 100% stop Evil Angel from doing anything. But that breaks the metaphor, because real teenage girls don't have stalker ex-boyfriend garlic they can hang in their window and they don't have Holy Crosses of Ex-Boyfriend Repellent they can hand out to their friends. So for the sake of the story, she must be an idiot to make her relatable. 


  I feel like all but the most locked down magic systems operate on this principle too, of placing drama over intelligence. It's simply too hard to prevent loopholes creeping into your magic system, and eventually you have to just have to introduce an arbitrary line in the sand to avoid your universe becoming ridiculous. For example in True Blood, when a vampire is uninvited from a house a force slowly pushes them to the nearest exit. No big deal you think? Nope, that's infinite energy and reactionless drives right there. Eventually an author just has to throw up his hands and say "Screw it, for the sake of preserving the relatability of this universe you cannot build a space house rocket ship using vampires as the fuel. In-universe logic be damned, this is the line we cannot cross".

  Rationalist fiction is unique in placing in-universe logic ahead of real world drama, but it's sometimes useful to remember that it's not the only choice we can make.

    Which kind of makes me wonder why no-one dealing with vampires has rigged up a house where there's only one exit, made of solid iron, and it can be partially closed until it's about one foot across. Uninvite one or more vampires from *that* place and there's some squelching and screaming going to be happening.
    ```

    - u/sparr:

      Doesn't the show include some vampires being ejected from houses where the doors were simply closed? I can't remember if they show the door opening magically, or if the vampire just disappears down a hallway and then shows up outside.
      ```

      - u/vakusdrake:
        ```
        I'm pretty sure I remember the door flying open in at least one case, so I don't think there's ever any teleportation involved. Though that raises the question of what the limits are on the magical door opening.

            Well, point is that show could have easilly had a different moral of "if %relatable thing% happens, then deal with it directly". I haven't watched it, but take that immortal vampire stalker thing. Suppose she only found out he was stalking her after he was doing that for a couple months (making the setup relatively relatable), but when she did, she immediately set up traps against him. Would be a much more uplifting moral imo.
            ```

              There's a strong political element to the idea of people taking up weapons to defend themselves. In Canada it's straight up illegal for anyone to carry *any* kind of weapon for self defense, even pepper spray. You have to pretend you're carrying the spray for "bear protection" (The most dangerous kind of bear walks on two legs, so not entirely a lie?) or you'll get slapped with criminal charges. So the show might also not want to have Buffy defeat Angel through the use of weapons because it offends their politics that teenage girls might be trying to do the real life equivalent (e.g. get a gun). 

              Personally I definitely would've enjoyed the show more if Buffy was a rationalist and just started carrying a Glock full of wooden bullets. [Buffy drops the karate gimmicks and just lays out a mofo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayoR0jF0vuY)

              You need to watch it *right now*. It is a seminal piece of television that still mostly holds up to this very day. Tv tropes itself began as an attempt to catalogue all the tropes Buffy subverted and played with - only later did it evolve into covering all shows, and eventually all media.

    >infinite energy and reactionless drives

    If the source of energy isn't specified, that doesn't mean there cannot be one. (A strange manner of moving people around a house, or mechanical energy that may be collected, is all that is implied.)

    >or making all her friends carry crosses and holy water on them at all times,

    It's also possible to *have* these options, but have them be unusable *most* of the time - not everyone will just wear a cross every day just because you ask them too, but if you're really close friends with someone who is really religious, maybe they'll wear a gift with a symbol of their faith a lot of the time.

        >used up all the vampire pushing energy!"

        Just because there's an energy source doesn't mean it's feasibly exhaustible. Despite all the things that have been dropped over the years, gravity still works on Earth. If the energy source is the vampires, then it's not going to run out. If the energy source is a deity, then it may last as long as they're around (or care).

        >Can the star of david repel vampires too?

        That varies from story to story. I've seen one answer that explicitly with 'If the vampire is jewish. Crosses only work on christian vampires. If a vampire loses faith, *nothing* works.'

        An author could also say 'it works with any religion!', or any suitably large religion because they've got enough worshippers that they have the power to help them out, or 'it works if the person holding the symbol believes'.

  I think this is another big thing about writing intelligent characters - you have all the time in the world to think of solutions and logical processes, and then you can write that out as happening in seconds/minutes. As well as the fact that, as the author, you already likely know what's going on everywhere, or at least have a good idea, so you already know what kind of conclusions you want your character to reach.

  I think it helps a lot to write some dumb characters for the smarties to get one over on. Like, the 'smart' level to play at is one level above your competition,  yeah? So if you make the loser as smart as you can you are screwing yourself when it comes time to write the person who outwits them.
