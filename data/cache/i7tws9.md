  So Baba took the weird dream she had *many* chapters ago as being a divine commandment to help the Instruments? Damn, she put WAY too much emphasis on the "do not offend gods" thing and didn't pay NEARLY enough attention to the "just do good" part of her instructions. Now the question is whether she'll immediately try and sabotage her "allies" in the name of damage control or whether she'll largely stay the current course out of fear for her life (since she knows just how horrible death would be for her right now).

    >  many chapters ago

    Or... four months of in-universe time. Damn, even with time skips I'm writing the events slower than they're *happening*.

    >put WAY too much emphasis on the "do not offend gods" thing and didn't pay NEARLY enough attention to the "just do good"

    it will end badly for her because her utility function is to please gods and not just to 'do good for the sake of good'

    What did she dream? I do not remember anything at all
    ```

    - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
      ```
      She mentions it again in this chapter, but it's at the end of chapter 22. Basically some vague imagery that led her to believe that she should follow Mai/Violin and help her in order to curry favour with Kami.

  So the idea for how Babas' magic power works is now more explained in a way that fits somewhat with the rest of the metaphysics of the universe, nice. It seems rather simple, in the end - just have your soul knocked slightly out of synch with your body, and the rest is practice. I've thought about how to abuse this to create more mediums on purpose, but it all depends on how common soul-affecting items or techniques are and what the chances of things going wrong are. Artifacts on the caliber of immortality elixir are likely pretty rare, and mistakes in disturbing the soul would obviously lead to bad consequences - death, or worse. All in all, I like it. 

  Her motaivations are also fascinating. She wants to get into heaven when she dies, and is able to mostly figure out the conditions for "doing good" by talking to judged souls. She seems to arrive at conclusions close to Effective Altruism, which is neat. She might be able to good with her abilities directly, but she can probably maximise the goodness better by selling to the highest bidder and then using that money efficiently. The catch is, of course, to make sure you're not comitting any greater evils in earning that money, which is where she seems to have stumbled. I wonder who she was tricked by? She's not impressed by people like her brother, so simple power displays wouldn't fool her. The only one on earth I can think of who has a reasonable chance of being mistaken for a god is Piccolo himself - she's certainly old enough to have met him. 

  I had honestly forgotten about Ninja Murasaki, probably because he was only around for a chapter or so. Good to see he remains ridiculous, and just as capable and useful.

    She had a dream at the end of the Tenkaichi tournament. Just like a lot of other people all around the world involved in this affair, and Piano himself. Chapter 27 shows how even Bulma, Commander Black, Tao Pai Pai and Chichi, among others, had such dreams, albeit less direct in their message, and how it subtly affected them.

      Really? I must have forgotten, after all this time. Maybe I should reread.
      ```

      - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
        ```
        ...for what it's worth, so should I :P. And I generally have good memory for this stuff (and the entire story in mind pretty much from Day 1, minus a few details).
        ```

- u/Slinkinator:
  ```
  Ha! YES!

  I'm at work so I can't read right this second, but I am STOKED.
  ```

- u/Dezoufinous:
  ```
  Finally! Very good plot twists.

  &#x200B;

  >!So, basicaly, Baba helped Instruments and then she talked to God Enma and realized she was doing wrong?!<
  ```

  - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
    ```
    >!Yeah, that's the gist of it. She did it thinking it was part of some greater, ineffable plan she couldn't fathom. Now she's mostly just confused.!<
    ```

    - u/Dezoufinous:
      ```
      What you did is a very good explanation >!of deus ex machina fortune-teller!<. The only thing I am missing is that maybe you should hint earlier that >!Baba powers are 'rational' because in the previous episode readers might feel hit by the irrationality of her power. Maybe I didn't read deep enough and it's just my subjective opinion, but I feel that her character and powers could be a bit more justified earlier in the story.!<
      ```

      - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
        ```
        Hm, well, for her character the mystery was intentional. For her powers I did drop bits and pieces (the expired elixir was mentioned at her first appearance, and during the Tenkaichi attack sequence I tried to make it clear that her power is mediated by telepathy more than being pure divination), but yes, never gave the full picture. I thought it could be fine as long as an explanation eventually came. I'll also say that as a rule, given that I'm adapting a universe like Dragon Ball, the rational aspect always leans on the soft side. There's just too many crazy characters and powers to make sense of all of it in an airtight manner.
        ```

        - u/crivtox:
          ```
          Yeah I don't think you really need to explain everything explicitly. 
          Or at least you don't need to explain all the powers we see, 
          It is better if you do have an idea of how they work yourself but the audience doesn't need to immediately get explanations for everything.
          Especially if it's not helping the protagonists.
          ```

          - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
            ```
            Also, calling too much attention to Baba and her powers might have made her involvement more obvious. I didn't want to outright conceal it of course, one could have seen it coming, but I wanted to do a bit of misdirection and sort of make you forget about it and wonder about the possible spy/leak until it just hits you in the face.

- u/Dezoufinous:
  ```
  just a little question, not strictly related to this episode...

  **!rational Puar vs !rational Instruments, who would win, why and how?**
  ```

  - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
    ```
    Well, Puar lost against Bulma. The Instruments don't have anyone as smart on their side (in fact, let's face it, they're on average quite stupid and conceited; Piano is easily the smartest of their lot), but they do have General Blue/Flute, whose power is a hard counter to Puar if he can only look him in the eyes, and Mai/Violin who is quite the tough fighter. And of course, vast numerical superiority. But if it was a scenario like "the Instruments kidnapped Yamcha, Puar wants to free him", I'd give it to Puar. If it was to the death of either side, then maybe the Instruments. If you count Tao Pai Pai as on their side, well... I'd say that increases their hopes significantly. Much like in canon, Tao is both cunning and strong.
