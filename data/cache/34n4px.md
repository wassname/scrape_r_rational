  Vidre has an excellent point about how now every civilian at a fight between illustrati is going to try to backstab the villain.

  I think the solution is to spread it around that Dominic Lightscour wasn't just a random nobody at the time; he was already a fledgling hero. Earned his domain as a runner, got powerful enough with it that attacking Zerstor wasn't suicide, and was just waiting for an opportunity to get out of the criminal life and use his powers for good. It's even true, mostly. 

  Then only people who already have some power are going to try to imitate him. Still a problem, but much less so. And as a bonus, spreading the story will increase Dominic's power that much more.

  Something I'm interested in is how closely the stories have to be related to a person to grant them power.

  Obviously it's quite abstract but there are plenty of examples in our own history of multiple real people merging into some single person in tales.

  Curiously since infamy is more compelling to real humans there's a real incentive to commit evil acts in this, and also an incentive from any governing bodies to silence criminals and the such without saying a word, certainly leads to dystopia.

  There's also mention of democracy in this chapter, you wot? A bunch of merchants would have far less fame than a single figurehead unless you get all the fame of your family name or something (see: Rockefellers)


  In terms of slaves, why would you allow any of them to have a tongue? If I was a slave owner I would brand them with my name as that surely counts as recognition/fame, if you're the owner of slave ships or plantations that's 200 people who're going to know recognize you. Again it incentives being the biggest dick possible since if you're just like any other slave driver when the slaves move they won't talk about you.

  Edit: Alternatively sell being nice to slaves for money, so a illustria or whatever comes in and gives them all chocolate and then they won't stop talking about how great they were.

  Alternatively you want to raise people to not be able to communicate about anyone except yourself that would be the best, so have your name be sign language or something unique like a brand as I said so the only thing they could communicate in would be regarding to you.

    "Being a dick to everyone" is a level 1 strategy. Since *everyone* can get powers through fame, you're in competition with all of them, and a lot of them are *also* going to try the BADTE strategy, trying to outcompete each other along those lines, until eventually the market is saturated with dicks, and they're no longer really distinct. You're no longer "the dick", you're "one of those dicks". Like how a vampire novel makes it big, and then there are a ton of replaceable vampire novels that come out the year after to try to capitalize on the trend but find no success because there's a glut in the market.

    More than trying to be a dick, what you'd want to find is an area of the fame market that you can exploit. *Maybe* that's by being a dick to people. But maybe it's by being a big shining beacon of hope and goodness. Or by being a low-brow comedian. Or by being a stoic. You carve out your own section of the market, try to be original and probably fail, since there have been hundreds of years of people trying to be original. The BADTE strategy is one of the competing strategies in the fame market, alongside "be really fucking nice to everyone you meet" and "be a snide asshole with a heart of gold" and "be innocent and virginal" and "rebel against the status quo" and "be a fount of wisdom".

    The optimal strategy depends on what strategy everyone else is following.

  > Dominic didn’t wait for the count this time, and moved towards her. **For a moment thought** that he might be able to land a solid hit, one she wasn’t prepared for, even if it was sloppy.

  I think there's a missing 'he' there.

  *Fantastic* story so far! I don't read that much, just some stuff on and off, but I am so glad I found this. Each chapter has done an excellent job of getting my blood pumping. Keep up the solid work /u/alexanderwales! I look forward to following this for a long time :)

    Alright, fixed that, thank you. And glad you're enjoying it!

  Have you considered including reward tiers to your Patreon campaign? People would be more motivated to donate if you included things such as a cameo (like the sailor, Michael, in this chapter), a beautifully formatted pdf with all of the current chapters, a short story for the highest tiers, a chapter about a myth or legend set in the world based on a prompt chosen by your backers, and more!

    "Donate 10 dollars and get a cameo as a sailor, one of a number of people who's job is to have as few defining characteristics as possible! Donate 15 dollars and you get a WoG stating that you were definitely no kidding for realsies an unidentified member of a mob!"

    I probably will. I write in Scrivener, which has a compile function, and can "Compile to PDF" with some settings. I want to be able to do something like the HPMOR PDF, which I was a fan of. I've done a few test compiles, and there are some kinks that need to be worked out before I can consider it good enough. There's also the question of distribution, but I think it might be enough to just have it as a Patreon-sub-only link. Hopefully I'll have that figured out by next chapter, if it doesn't cut into writing/editing time.

    The other stuff I'll think about. I did some of the cameo stuff for *Metropolitan Man*, which I think had generally positive results - cameos are best when you need a throwaway name and can just grab from a list of people who helped you out by pointing out typos (or in this case, donated), rather than having a scene for themselves.
