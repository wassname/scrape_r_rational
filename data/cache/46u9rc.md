  It was this story which inspired me to create what ultimately became [deeprise](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/DeepRise).

  The only real concept that survived was the use of the term Royal and Noble.

  But I adored this story.

  I liked Neil Gaiman approach on Lovecraftian horrors.
  Especaily in the ocean at the end of the lane where it is explained why lovecraftian horrors do not invade our world.

  ```
  I've always wanted a continuation of this.
