  Read the first two parts. Kinda regretting it now. 

  Poorly written, tended to meander very long on useless tangents, and ultimately rather boring. Had one or two interesting ideas, but nothing majorly new.

    I concur. The quality only worsened with each successive story. 

    Furthermore, people need to STOP posting links without comment or description or summary, even if said link contains such information.

  I read the first three parts. The first chapter was a bit slow, but good in an understated way. It has that delightful disorienting feeling where we don't know if the protagonist is going mad or the world is or both. Nominally science fiction but I wouldn't be surprised to see it on the lit-fic shelf. Hints at a lot and shows the bare minimum it can get away with - such a naughty tease, but then it *does* get away with it.

  Then the next two-and-a-quarter chapters ate up the goodwill that the first one had established. The first chapter becomes a fictional story written by the protagonist of the second chapter, who is the same person? Fine. I've seen worse ways to reboot a franchise.

  Except that we then retread the same events, only slower and with none of the subtlety the first run had. Same characters, too. Plus the story of the first chapter being made into an in-story movie, so we're revisiting the same plot two times in parallel when we've already had it once. Which would be fine, clever even, if the story wasn't so damn *slow*! There's so much unnecessary dithering, so much character backstory that doesn't have any bearing on the plot!

  Chapter Three treads a little new ground, but Chapter Four then reboots it again. With the same it-was-all-a-story-I-wrote device. That's where I gave up on seeing any resolution to anything. Maybe there's some incredibly clever metafictional time-bomb here that'll go off in a few more chapters, but I've lost my patience for it.

  Chapter One stands as a complete story on its own. Read that and then stop.

  This is a slow read. It doesn't pull you page to page, it hints at the edges, it justifies its failings by claiming self-awareness - I don't know how clever it really is, but don't read it in a go. Come back later.
