## What if Jack Black was a superintelligence? (Or, theoretical limits to conventional education.)

### Post:

I've been watching School of Rock. It's still great (to me at least) after quite a long time.

Say an arbitrarily clever superintelligence (who is outwardly indistinguishable from a slightly overweight 30-year-old) has three weeks in which to perform as a substitute teacher at an expensive preparatory school in a well off part of the United States. How far can they (conventionally/non-invasively) educate a reasonably diverse class of ~20 well adjusted, healthy and fairly intelligent ten-year-olds in that time while keeping them well adjusted, healthy and fairly intelligent? Only counting what they learn in that time period. For all intents and purposes, Jack Black has PtV.

In other words, what are the limits on how much information an adolescent human can meaningfully assimilate through the normal senses (5/9/11/whatever) while retaining long term functionality in a given length of time?

Also does anyone wanna discuss the actual film? It's not particularly rational (or festive), but I like it a lot, and would love to learn of any alternative viewpoints you might have.

EDIT: The kids should retain individuality, continuity of consciousness and their humanity. No giving them superhuman abilities or subliminally implanting an intelligence in their mind that takes over while being outwardly undetectable, or whatever loopholes you can imagine. They should be the same people (and physically human) at the end (and for roughly as long as any other human could expect to be), just knowing a lot more (useful) information than before.

  There's that often-quoted figure about how it takes 10 thousand hours of practice to master any given skill, but one element often left out of the quote is that the practice *needs* to involve some element of effective feedback, the more of it and the faster the better, so that you can iterate on each building block of the skill in as tight a loop as possible. Otherwise you're just messing about by yourself with limited ability to direct yourself towards getting *better*.

  A teacher with PtV would be able to intervene at exactly the right moment with exactly the right combination of criticism, encouragement and advice, to keep you learning smoothly and keep your motivation up.

  I don't know quite what that perfectly smooth rate of skill acquisition looks like, but this is what I'd expect to be the 'value-add' of boosting Jack Black into a superintelligence.

      Yeah, would depend on whether more *unconventional* teaching methods can be applied without leaving the students damaged or altered in a way that strays outside the boundaries set by "while keeping them well adjusted, healthy and fairly intelligent"

      For example, *maybe* a setup inspired by *A Clockwork Orange* would be an effective way to teach, if you had PtV omnipotence to control the experience perfectly towards stimulating the brain in just the right way, but they would probably also be traumatised by the experience...

        The other side is just how flexible/useful is a clockwork orange style education going to be? what is the GOAL of education?

        if the goal is to cram them with parroting facts then ya I could see that working. If the goal is to have brains that can accomplish tasks as good general intelligences (or as good as humans can get) then the results will look a lot more like what is DESCRIBED in Dune. In particular the first lesson you must teach a child is how to most effectively learn.

      I've always thought that the point of rational fiction was to use popular culture as a jumping-off point to explore real life applications of rationality. And seeing as complexity theory has been very useful in computer science, why not apply it to a soft science, like pedagogy, and see what happens? You've gotta start somewhere.

  Y'all need to stop underestimating, Jack 'best song in the world' Black!

  He's got the function mapping goals to their most actionable paths, and the best you think he can come up with, is to provide feedback... **FEEDBACK!!!** 

  I don't think so!

  Maybe some other pansy-ass PtV user \*cough* Contessa \*cough* would be so banal, but this is Jack 'patron saint of rock' Black, and **he** has deemed these children worthy of **his** blessing. 

  Jack 'Kung Fu Panda' Black will not be limited by something as menial, as a child's learning rate. He's going to sing a song, which exploits the zero-days in their heads, and results in them being perfect acolytes of rock.

  **And not only that.**

  This song will be *the greatest song in the world*, not just a tribute.

  One of the biggest problems in teaching, especially of younger children, is maintaining attention and concentration. Children below a certain age are pretty much physically incapable of long stretches of concentration and of redirecting their focus. 

  So give them lots of drugs. Superjackblack should give each kid the highest doses of ritalin/adderall/modafinil possible without causing permanent damage, so they get as much as possible from the lessons and minimise the time needed to repeat and go over things. The limiting factor would be whether the parent/other teachers would notice. 

  *on the film in general* Having worked in education I can't  help thinking about how much of a child protection and liability clusterfuck would result. What the hell was the school doing that Jack Black could impersonate another teacher? Everyone would be fired.

    > What the hell was the school doing that Jack Black could impersonate another teacher? Everyone would be fired.

    Having coincidentally watched the movie last week, my impression was Robin Hanson-esque (is there a name for that yet?): the school was very prestigious, and so they hired very prestigious teachers, and so it would be *disrespectful to those teachers' prestige* to ask them to bring their teaching certificates to the interview or any such thing.

    I think this generalizes to the real world: the minimum-wage jobs I applied for fresh out of school cared *far* more about seeing proof of any credentials I claimed than the skilled professional jobs I applied for later on. There comes a point when you're working for "classy"-enough employers/clients when you get hired entirely through dinner and a handshake.

    This keeps the door open for cronyism and confidence men, but at the same time, it mostly works: clients/employers are effectively pre-screening potential contractors/employees using the "pickiness" of the social networks that referred them. The harder it is to even get heard about by someone (think, for example, Venture Capitalists who only take "warm intros" sponsored by other VCs), the less they have to worry that you've faked your way into their view. This also works out to mean that the *more you pay*, the fewer people there are who've built up a reputation working at that high a level, and so the easier it is to trust any of them sight-unseen.

    And let me make the opposite cases explicit: the less picky your "funnel", and the less you pay, the more scrutiny you have to give candidates. (My impression is that a large part of the problem Millenials are having getting jobs is that they are stuck in the highest-scrutiny part of the funnel.)

    Also, trades jobs are an exception to this rule, probably because the incentives are in closer to the right places: the employer is forced by the trade union to get proof that you're a union member; and the trade union acts a lot like a guild, worrying about the skill-training and certification of its members, so that it can use its members uniform high qualifications as leverage in negotiations with companies. When "union = qualified; scab = unqualified" is a meme, trade unions win, but oddly enough, customers also win.

  Though I guess the title says "conventional education". Would it count if I would really like conventional education to include an upload? Alternatively, replace the upload step with something like "cover students' eyes with nanobots, Clockwork Orange mathematics into their brains".

  - u/Kuratius:

    Ow. The nanobots idea could have issues that include permanent brain damage, or it'll end up with weird-looking nerve structures depending on the method used to create structures optimized for processing of data, which is what you want to do when teaching.

    It's got a few kinks that may need to be ironed out.  Also, you vastly underestimate the time needed for creating that many without exploiting self-replication. The real cheat would be for the nanobots to act as a brain machine interface, with the rock patterns already programmed into it.

      Right, I wasn't clear enough when I said "iterate". Did manage to say "seed", but that's not enough. Phone keyboard compelling terse output. "Recurse" would have been a better word.

      And, yeah, bootstrapping a better BCI using nanobots is another good idea.

  As one who teaches children (6 to 15 year olds. Mostly ten year olds) a seemingly advanced skill (computer programming) and also works with some one who found a clever teaching hack for getting math across.

  I'm pretty sure at least 60% of the time spent in conventional lessons is making sure everyone is on the same page.

  As a game designer one of the things I think about a lot is how to give the right learning curve and feedback loop.

  So you might already see the way I'm going here but a super intelligence would know exactly what each child could be motivated by. How to hold all of their interest, how to inspire attention and exactly when to make breaks or changes of subject to keep attention and intake at maximum without overload. How to make learning not just fun but addictive and probably exactly how addictive is healthy.

  The resulting kids probably would not necessarily know many facts and figures (they might) but I suspect they would by the end be some of the best self educators humanly possible to create.

  They might also never quite relate the same way to normal educated humans again. But they probably won't mind helping their peers catch up.

    How do you feel about the basic flipped-classroom model as a way to achieve this? It seems a lot easier to me to get everyone on the same page with a lecture-video watched at home that can be paused and replayed as needed, and maybe "folded out" to get extra optional examples at each step.

    Going further and throwing in the simplest possible game elements, it's easy enough to have the lecture-video ask the kids questions during it and check the responses, which means every kid gets individually engaged with, something nobody has time for in a classroom setting.

    A lecture-video app/site would also *theoretically* let you track engagement/attention with eye-tracking et al, so the video could actually pause itself upon noticing a lack of engagement, telling the child to go do whatever has them so distracted and then come back. Or you could just split the lesson into pomodoros, and have a warm-up ("mental stretches") before each one involving some IQ calibration task (e.g. dual N-back) that can tell the app whether the student is at their mental best at the moment.

  Since it sounds like you're a huge fan of the movie... do you know about the [Broadway Musical](http://www.broadway.com/shows/school-rock-musical/) and the 
  [School of Rock 10 Year Reunion (Concert) on YouTube?](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlyqiKfW2PtgeDSAoHRIGMZNOhWFV-GJ5
  )

  Here's my quick take on the subject after watching a few youtube videos to re-acquaint myself with the movie.

  ----------------

  Professor Jack Black had lost all respect for the current generation of students. Their music was bland and boring. How could he inculcate them with a glam Rock Star's emotional stance -- the pluck to take risks in their lives, to start a band, perhaps even several after the first efforts had failed? He had studied the biographies of several notable peers and found a few common threads between them.

  He couldn't prevent the creme de la creme from enrolling in the very school for which he had lost all respect. But why not give a new class of students a gift that would supply the ingredient missing in school?

  [If this sounds familiar, it's because I just adapted it from Neal Stephanson's Diamond Age.]

  *break*

  Professor Black tore his eyes away from the Mirror of Noitlov and developed his strategem. He scried on his students and selected a special class.  He accessed their educational/psychological reports like the [Kolb Learning Inventory](http://learningfromexperience.com/tools/kolb-learning-style-inventory-lsi/) and the [VARK Inventory](http://vark-learn.com/the-vark-questionnaire/) and developed the perfect learning plan suited to each individual students' needs.

  He was almost ready. He had a list of different improv rock songs he could riff off of. He planned out the character development moments he would have with each student that would push them to the next step in achieving their potential for rock and roll.

  He needed to get into the right character. Ah yes. 

  He would pretend to be a lazy and goofy substitute teacher. This would ally him with their interests and they would relax with him. Many of them lacked confidence and were cut down by their parents, by the school system, or by their peers. From the Mirror, he knew what was going on in their home and school lives, but it was important to build a genuine connection with students in order to get them to care.

  Most importantly, he would be passionate about his subject matter. His exuberance would inspire the students. They would see him as a wild subversive element in the school, contrasted with the traditional, authoritarian figures of prep school. Through cognitive psychology, he would trick them into caring about the subject of rock and roll, tapping into their individual talents and unite them into a solid rock band.

  He envisioned a loser who was kicked out of his own rock band. A character struggling to pay the rent that was way past due.

  He was ready.

  Professor Black raised his wand and cast his last magic spell, knowing that Rock and Roll was all the magic he needed. **CONFUNDUS.**

  I think you're underestimating a superintelligence by equating it with Path to Victory. Even with "conventional/non-invasive" methods, the superintelligence solution to this problem probably looks more like "Spend an appropriate amount of time (maybe an hour at most) revising all of modern physics, economics, psychology, etc. so that it simply and compactly contains all the accurate, "true" models for the universe, spend maybe another five minutes coming up with a curriculum that assesses the current state of mind and knowledge of each individual student determines the exact, minimum set of logical steps they'd have to make to come to grips with each of these truths, and present them in order."

  Meanwhile, it will have naturally managed to assemble an appropriate enough fraction of the world's resources to ensure all the needs and learning-conducive wants of the children are met - enough money and construction crews to build an entirely new learning space by the end of the first week at the latest, and Secret Service-esque security forces to prevent any attempt to interfere with the education, full time medical staff to monitor the children's physiological condition, multiple individual counselors to assist in any psychological issues, and even if hiring actors or directly paying them would be awkward, I'm sure it would be able to assemble an emotional support network for each of them that would range from professional athletes, scientists, for inspiration, and encouraging, attractive peers for motivation, and rivals in competition for immediacy pressure.

  I don't know nearly enough about learning rates to weigh to heavily the accuracy of this guess, but I estimate we'd be looking at at least the equivalent of ~2-4+ years of conventional education in the space of three weeks. The high end of that is based mostly on not knowing how much information would be condensed into the superintelligence's new knowledgebase after rewriting all of conventional knowledge - it might turn out that the grand unification theory of physics is actually really simple and easy to understand and apply, for instance. and in that case we're talking 7-10+ years of physics education crammed into an afternoon. If we're talking simply how much to I think of the current typical curriculum we could get them to pass a test on at the end of the three weeks, we're probably much closer to the two years.

    > superintelligence by equating it with Path to Victory

    The PtV is run by what is basically a superintelligence (with a weird, author imposed stipulation) tied to a human. 

    I mean, really, all the stuff you bring up here is well within its wheelhouse, the difference is just that the actions have to be funneled through a meatbag.
