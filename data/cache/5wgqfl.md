  Hey all,

  I just released a new novel, [Sufficiently Advanced Magic](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XBFD7CB/), that I think would appeal to some of the people around here.

  It takes place in a JRPGish setting, with the action split between a magical university setting and a ever-changing uber dungeon. There's a lot of emphasis on learning the rules of magic and applying them - both in research and in combat.

  In addition to JRPGs, I drew a lot of inspiration from Mother of Learning and Tower of God. If you like the idea of something like Mother of Learning with more of a JRPGish bent, I think you might enjoy this. (No time loop here, though, so don't expect that.)

  In terms of the writing style, I'm most frequently compared to Sanderson, but I tend to lean toward more anime-style tropes.

  Feel free to post if you've got any questions or anything. Hope you all enjoy it if you check it out!

    Awesome. Like Sanderson, you're novels are all an "instant-purchase" for myself... I found Forging Divinity in 2015 by random chance (I think your novel showed up in the "Also liked" list for Brian McClellan's Powder Mage works...) and love your writing style.

    Can't wait to read this.

      I'm honored to be compared to Sanderson. He's one of my main inspirations as a writer. Thank you for the kind words and support. I hope you love the book!

    Hi,

    I finished Sufficiently Advanced Magic yesterday and I enjoyed it. I think you succeeded in what you set out to achieve. The towers give a strong 'gaming' feel - both in 'like a jrpg' and in the 'here's a game, now figure out how to beat it' sense. That's was good and I really enjoyed it. The magic was also quite nice, clearly rule based but also with enough breath to feel magical. You mention Sanderson in your post and a problem I sometimes have with Sanderson's magic systems is that they are too limited, more a limited set of superpowers than magic.

    At times the main character did seem to lack knowledge that I really feel should be common knowledge - the kind of thing you pick up through cultural osmosis. Why is fairly clear - it's always easier and more natural to explain things to the reader if the main character is learning them too - but Corin isn't Harry Potter entering a world for the first time. This is his world that he grew up in and I don't think it all could be blamed on cutting himself off from everyone to train.

    That said, the Mother of Learning inspiration was clearly evidence and here as in there, it is very nice to see a character slowly learn the rules and exploit them.

    In short, I enjoyed reading Sufficiently Advanced Magic and will pick up the squeal if and when it arrives.
    ```

      Glad you enjoyed the book!

      Completely agree, I think this was my biggest flaw in writing the book. I should have made it clearer that some of the classroom stuff  would have been simply review for Corin, and would have been in the classes simply for the benefit of people like Marissa who may not have had a solid educational foundation, or maybe foreigners who were only aware of their own culture's attunements, etc.

      Corin definitely should have basic understanding of his society and culture. I think I handled that okay in some places (like his knowledge about the Six Year War and his great grandfather's role in it), but I definitely should have had him rolling his eyes in some of the basic magic instructions.

      Glad you enjoyed the book overall, and I'll try to make sure that in the future, I don't make anything seem foreign to Corin that should be common knowledge from someone who grew up in the setting.

      Thanks for the review!

      > Started reading your book. It somehow triggered a deep need to play a game version of this, collect monster crystals and craft items.

      Glad it triggered that instinct. =D I'd love to get a game made in this setting eventually. 

      > What JRPGs in particular were you inspired by?

      Tons of them.

      The tower itself was inspired by Azure Dreams, as well as the Ancient Cave in Lufia 2: Rise of the Sinistrals. There are plenty of other games with similar elements, but those were my initial inspiration. There's a little nod in there to Tower of Druaga, too, which was one of the earliest "giant tower dungeon crawl" games.

      The idea of a setting where everyone is aware of character classes existing and that they can be earned was inspired by Bravely Default.

      Many of the specific attunements are heavily inspired by Final Fantasy. Sera is basically a Final Fantasy style Summoner, for example. (Although you could argue she's got a lot in common with Sheena from Tales of Symphonia, too.)

      Much of the magical technology style is inspired by Final Fantasy 6. There's a lot of similarity to The Legend of Heroes as well - that's less intentional, even if they actually ended up coming across as more similar in some respects. (I haven't actually played Trails of Cold Steel yet, for example, but there's a ton of similarity from what I've seen from watching someone else play recently.)

      The society placing a lot of value on retainers is pretty heavily inspired by Fire Emblem. 

      Four of the God Beasts are based on Japanese mythological beings (that are based, in turn, on Chinese ones). Using them as tower bosses was inspired by the very first SaGa game (Final Fantasy Legend in the US), which also happens to have a tower climbing plot.

      There are other smaller influences as well, but those are some of the big ones.

  I gave it a read on a whim. A few impressions follow.

  First, the title is crap. The usual inversion of Clarke's Law is "Sufficiently advanced magic is indistinguishable from technology." Which makes me think the protagonist would be an inventor, or in today's parlance, an engineer. I like those kinds of stories. Generally speaking, only engineers (of some stripe) can pull it off. Unfortunately, this author is clearly not one of those. The title could still be forgivable, but now I'm asking "Sufficient for what?"

  The writing style makes the sin of being *tedious*. Conservation of detail would be welcome. The dungeon crawling is simply boring. I really don't want to read a blow-by-blow of a D&D campaign. On the positive side, people turned off by this will be turned off within the first few pages, so there's really no complaining when it happens again. Unfortunately, the school scenes are just as tedious. Every time the narrator goes "Wow, that could be really useful!" is grating. Most of the classroom lectures are pointlessly dull. Characters taking time out from important matters to lecture about magic is off-putting. The story really could have been told in a third of the space it currently uses, and would be a more exciting read for it.

  The character motivations don't really work. The main character fails to be motivated by anything but to "Get Power". Ostensibly, the reason is to get his brother back, but I'm not sold. The only other motivation I see is to protect his sister, which is actually convincingly demonstrated, but only comes up a few times. I also wish I'd seen the main character trying to have fun. Instead, it's a 24/7 grind to gain power (which he's not even very effective at).

  I'm rather put off by the main character's stated values. He demonstrates values more closely aligned to modern enlightenment ideals, which are markedly different from those present in the most of the characters. It starts feeling a bit like an author tract.

  Finally, what is with that one character suddenly coming out two thirds of the way through? And nobody reacting at all. I get that romance isn't a significant part of the story. Fine. And I get that maybe this is a very normal thing in the setting. Fine. But it has not been demonstrated in the least bit up to this point. No reference to any couples to give the reader any expectation of social norms, just a general sense of heteronormative behaviors. This scene could have been removed entirely without changing anything.

  As for whether this work is a rat!fic... I don't know. Conflicts motivated by beliefs and values? Check. Consistent rules? Close enough. Intelligent characters? Sometimes. Not often enough. And plot-wise, the only characters making significant decisions are doing so in the background, off-screen; the plot essentially moves without the main characters.


  All in all, this novel is not a polished work. There are a number of minor inconsistencies that should be resolved; quite a few scenes that should be removed/combined/shortened. And the main character needs to be reworked a bit to make him relatable and believable.

    Thank you for the review.

    I felt that the process of enchanting was sufficiently detailed to constitute the use of the title. The main character explicitly invents at least one item in the story [minor spoilers](#s "the mana watch"), and there's clearly a lot of research going on in the setting as a whole, such as [late book spoilers](#s "new forms of artificial attunements"). I'm sorry if this wasn't what you were looking for.

    If you're looking for faster pacing, that's just not my style. I write in a style more similar to Sanderson or Mother of Learning, with a lot of time put into people just learning about how magic works and doing their daily stuff. This sort of thing clearly isn't for everyone, but I like reading the more slice-of-life stuff, so I enjoy writing it as well.

    The main character is definitely driven by his ambition (as a means to save his brother), but he's hindered by [motivation spoilers](#s "crippling paranoia about causing himself permanent mental damage, which he eventually mitigates somewhat through inventing new technology"). His struggles to achieve his goals in spite of internal conflicts are part of the design of the story. I'm sorry you didn't like that component to it.

    As for his values system feeling too modern, it's a multi-cultural setting with a 1900s-era tech level. He's something of an outlier, but he's not that extreme of a case. If it was a medieval fantasy setting, I'd find his behavior too extreme, but I don't think it's that jarring at this tech/culture level.

    As for one character coming out and no one reacting, the only character that hears about it is the person who gets propositioned. They think about it and give an answer. 

    They didn't have to think about a ton of cultural consequences because there aren't any in this particular culture. The local religion has a goddess figure with six aspects of varying apparent sexes and genders, which has significantly helped to normalize the idea of different sexes/genders in this particular society. Individuals will have different views, of course, but their religion has made them more progressive about that issue than they are about some others. (For example, racism is still fairly common.)

    I would argue that the plot moves both in response to main character actions *and* in response to other actors, which is more realistic than a plot that is only driven by the main cast, in my opinion. Corin definitely triggers multiple plot events on-screen personally, but other people being involved in something that affects things on a national scale? That just makes sense.

    If you have specific scenes that you feel are inconsistent, I would be happy to hear about those examples so I can address any problems that exist in future works.

    Thank you for the detailed commentary.

  Spoilers: The jaden box seems hilariously broken. Applications I can think of off the top of my head are assassination and recovering missing persons.

  Minor nitpick: He almost kills himself with the ice sword and is supposed to receive specific training for it and then offers it to his friends when going into the climbers gate for the first time.
  ```

  - u/Salaris:
    ```
    There was actually a whole section of restrictions on the Jaden Box that got cut because it was so long that my beta readers complained. I kind of allude to it with the "see research notes" section in the description, but there are *some* reasonable limits on it.

    That said, it's still hilariously broken, and yes, it could still be used for both of those things. The target can resist the summoning attempt, so assassination would be trickier, but it would definitely be amazing for rescuing missing persons. The main limitation is the recharge time being so long.

    It's also built from a different type of magic than the current attuned use, so it wouldn't be trivial to duplicate it. (That's one of the things the researchers have already been trying to do.) Mass producing Jaden Boxes would completely change how society functions.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      I was assuming that it could be recharged through other methods like some of the other objects we've seen. Now that I think about it though we haven't seen anything this advanced be recharged by a person and even then if it was made using a different type of magic it'd be understandable if that didn't work.
      ```

      - u/Salaris:
        ```
        Yup. It wouldn't be impossible to recharge it manually, but their standard methods won't work. It would require research to figure out how to do it without breaking the box.
        ```

- u/generalamitt:
  ```
  I am probably going to get down voted for asking it, but is the main character gay?
  ```

  - u/Salaris:
    ```
    He's asexual and sapioromantic (meaning that romantically he's interested in people that intellectually interested him, regardless of their sex and gender). The closest thing to a love interest in the book is another male. This an extremely small part of the first book, but I am planning to do more with it in the sequels.
    ```

    - u/generalamitt:
      ```
      I don't understand how you can be romantically involved with someone if you are not attracted to them, how is that different from a very close friendship?
      ```

      - u/Salaris:
        ```
        Essentially, someone who is asexual but not aromantic enjoys forms of romantic bonding that are not of a sexual nature. 

        For example, they might enjoy going out on dates, dancing, cuddling, going to sleep together... it completely depends on the person, since different people define romantic activities differently.

        For someone who is asexual, sex is generally not the end-goal of romantic activities. They can still have increasing degrees of closeness with another person over time; again, the specific nature is going to vary based on the couple.

        As for how it differs from a close friendship, that's going to be up to the people involved. Some people might define having a candlelit dinner or holding hands at a movie as exclusively romantic activities; for others, they might be platonic. 

        I'm not any sort of authority on this subject. If you're interested in learning more, here's an [article](https://lgbtq.unc.edu/asexuality-attraction-and-romantic-orientation) on the subject, and you can easily find more on google if you want to learn more.

        If you don't like seeing male/male relationships, I suspect my book probably wouldn't interest you.

          Personally, I like the direction. It's was a bit surprising, but also refreshing to see things go in an unpredictable fashion for once. A lot of depth.

            ```
            I'm glad this worked for you! I wanted Corin to come across as a believable person, and I know that worked better for some people than others. Thanks!

                Thank you for making this post. It's important for me to get a reminder every once in a while that there are people out there who don't believe in asexuality. I'm glad I made the choice to write Corin as asexual, and you've reinforced that significantly.

      Please don't. Keep it about how awesome magic is. Forget his love life. Loved the book but the number one thing that I didn't like was  the not important to the story casual gay drop. Dude could have been Mormon in your book and neither would have had more consequence. 

      Drizzit didn't need a lover to be badass.
      ```

      - u/Salaris:
        ```
        The books will never be focused on romance, not by any stretch of the imagination. Learning magic and solving problems will always be the central focus of the story. 

        But this is about Corin's life as a whole, and there will be portions that deal with his relationships with his family members, his friendships, and potential romantic interests.

        Romance is definitely the least emphasized of the various types of relationships, but there are scenes were it may be at least somewhat relevant to the plot (like whether or not he brings someone with him to the winter ball, which is a major story event).

  So, I've read Forging Divinity and Sufficiently Advanced Magic and I absolutely love them both. 

  In Sufficiently Advanced Magic, I really enjoyed both settings of the school AND the dungeon crawl through the tower. I just wanted you to know so that you don't think some of the negative reviews/responses are indicative of all your readers. 

  I have one question though. Both of these series occur on the same planet, and the same time frame but have radically different magic systems.
  I had thought maybe the "Dominion Marks" might have been the equivalent of attunement runes, but they don't really seem to behave the same way or have the same power or magnitude. Then I thought perhaps the towers in both stories might be related, but they seem to be drastically different, both in the manner of entrance/exit and puzzles vs overt kill rooms.

  So, how does magic exist in the same time/planet in such different forms? Or is this puzzle meant for the reader to decipher?
  ```

  - u/Salaris:
    ```
    Thanks so much, I'm glad you enjoyed the books! 

    I'm especially glad you enjoyed both parts in Sufficiently Advanced Magic. I knew that mixing the two styles was unusual and that would rub some people the wrong way, so I'm happy it worked for you.

    Your question is pretty heavily related to the main plot of both series, so I wouldn't want to say too much and spoil things. The reasons for their distinct tech levels, cultures, and magic are absolutely something that is going to be explored in the story. 

    They're in the same universe, but I don't think I've said that they're on the same planet or in the same time frame. It's more complicated than that; I won't get into details because of heavy spoilers.

    [Spoiler for people who haven't finished Sufficiently Advanced Magic](#s "During the epilogue, Keras mentions something related to Dominion Marks, if you didn't notice already. He'll be a bigger player in the second part and a significant piece of the puzzle.")

  Read it after a friend recommended it to me.

  I was actually going to abandon the book about 10% of the way in because, having read a lot of really bad Japanese isekai web novels, I was convinced that this whole book will be about Corin flailing around in the tower until he gets some broken power. I'm glad I pushed on, because things got much more enjoyable once he leaves and interacts with normal people, and the straightforward snark is very refreshing to me. The engineering approach to magic is also highly interesting, and felt very relatable.

  I'm pleasantly surprised that this book became the first fantasy book I've read to feature a queer protagonist.

  I have some problems though:

  I got the Kindle edition, and you used "discrete" instead of "discreet" every single time. There were other spelling mistakes elsewhere too. I feel like the book could have used another technical editing pass.

  The gulf in power between characters made certain matchups and outcomes feel improbable. I'm not sure how you intend to patch the differences in power between the protagonists and his companions after the end of the first book.

  The book ended very awkwardly. [spoilers](#s "When Corin started school, I was given the impression of a Harry Potter style, one-book-per-school-year kind of setup, but by the end of the story I'm honestly not sure whether all that structure you set up for how the school works is even relevant anymore. Are they going back to school or not? The amount of loose ends sends a mixed message. It felt like you started well with Harry Potter Years 1-2 and at the 70% mark jumped straight to Year 7. I felt like the least you could do was put in the winter dance, or have the main characters try to return to some sense of normalcy (contrasted, of course, with the protagonist worrying over Jin) before wrapping things up with the final message from The Voice.")

  As a consequence, there are a lot of plot-irrelevant loose ends:

  * Nobody publicly names or seriously attempts to catch a Spider beyond Corin speculating on Jin. I was so excited for it.
  * A Hogwarts-style points system was introduced and the points were never totaled.
  * Curtis the dorm RA never shows up again after his introduction. Surely there were occasions in the book where he'd be useful, such as [mid book spoilers](#s "after Orden breaks down his door with a mock assassination")?
  * There was this girl, Cecily, that Corin made a point not to talk to a couple times. When you do this it's implied that I will eventually know why within the book, and it *never happens*. The book doesn't even begin to explain why, and I get to the appendix and it just says "for unknown reasons". I feel like you could have left her out entirely and mention at a later book that Corin had been avoiding her for a while.
  * Who was Sera's date for the winter dance supposed to be? That was dangled but I believe never answered? Things were supposed to be super awkward because of Corin's social screwup, and... that was basically thrown out.

    Hiya,

    Thanks for reading the book. 

    Some replies to your comments.

    > I'm glad I pushed on, because things got much more enjoyable once he leaves and interacts with normal people, and the straightforward snark is very refreshing to me. The engineering approach to magic is also highly interesting, and felt very relatable.

    Glad you liked these elements.

    > I got the Kindle edition, and you used "discrete" instead of "discreet" every single time. There were other spelling mistakes elsewhere too. I feel like the book could have used another technical editing pass.

    I fixed some of those recently, but I'm not sure when you got it. I did have a professional editor, but it's very possible I missed some of his notes. I may do a second edition at some point with another editing pass.

    > The gulf in power between characters made certain matchups and outcomes feel improbable.

    Which ones in specific, out of curiosity?

    I know it's common in xianxia and many isekai or LitRPG books for a couple tiers of power to be an insurmountable difference between characters. That's never been the intent in this series; a high powered human is still supposed to be in danger from low level ones under specific circumstances (e.g. if someone can work around their shroud). 

    High powered attuned are much more powerful *offensively* than low powered attuned, and have a lot more mana to work with. They are not, however, much more *defensively* powerful - their shroud gets stronger, but there are (as we've seen) a lot of ways around a shroud. That means that even the strongest humans are still relatively vulnerable to close range attacks, unless they also have a secondary form of defense (which some attuned do have, but we haven't seen a lot of it yet).

    Some monsters are also harder power checks; creatures like Mizuchi or Seiryu are just too tough for a low powered character to be able to reliably deal them damage. There may still be ways to work around this, however (e.g. specific weak points).

    I realize this is probably jarring because it's not standard for the genre. Most of my readers are probably expecting it to work more like an anime where a low level character would break their fist trying to punch someone of a higher power level; that's definitely not the intent here.

    > I'm not sure how you intend to patch the differences in power between the protagonists and his companions after the end of the first book.

    [Spoiler reply](#s "Not sure what power gulf you're thinking about here. Are you assuming that Corin's new attunement is powerful because it detected that way when it was a brand? I can see the reasoning behind that, but that's not the case. It's a standard attunement, and it'll just be based on the amount of power in his right hand, which is just slightly higher than what he has in his forehead. His total mana is still lower than Marissa's, even counting both attunements, and not that much above the rest of the main characters. He's still in the Quartz/Carnelian range.")

    > The book ended very awkwardly. 

    [Replies to spoilers](#s "Are you getting that impression because you think his power jumped up? If so, see above. He does have a new attunement, but that just makes him a bit more flexible - maybe twice as powerful, if even that. He absolutely will still be going back and finishing the rest of the school year, and the winter ball is a major event in the second book. I was originally going to put the whole first year in the first book, but the novel was already 218,000 words, and it felt like a good end point from a plot perspective. They're also almost exactly half way through the year. If you're thinking specifically in terms of the Tristan reveal coming too soon, I can see that argument. My intent was to shake up Corin's world view and let him start developing more as a person in the next half of the year, since he's going to have to challenge his preconceptions and figure out if Tristan is more important than his morals.")

    In regards to the loose ends, you're right - that's just a consequence of not covering the whole year in one book. The vast majority of that will be covered in the second book.

    > Curtis the dorm RA never shows up again after his introduction.

    Corin did talk to Curtis about that incident, but it's just summarized, rather than shown as a full scene. [Relevant quote](#s "Curtis, the dorm chief, had the same story. Apparently they hadn’t heard me screaming for help due to a rune Orden had marked in chalk on the wall outside my room. That was good. Everyone had heard the bullet, though. He’d made it outside to reassure the other students that it was just a drill shortly after Jin and I had fled the scene.
    He also mentioned that this sort of thing happened occasionally. He’d been a target of a similar “attack” himself the first year. Apparently, it was something of a tradition.")

    You're right that Corin could have made more use of Curtis, but Corin has serious trust issues in general. He doesn't like to rely on others in general, and certainly not relative strangers. This is a flaw that he needs to learn to work through.

    > Who was Sera's date for the winter dance supposed to be?

    The winter ball stuff, as well as Cecily, will be addressed in the second book. I also have a tendency to drop hints about things that could take a while to come up as major plot points (the Tyrant in Gold, the Seventh Spire, Selys-Lyann's origins, etc.) 

    It's just an element of my writing style; I tend to write more like a web serial, rather than each book being fully self-contained and plot driven. This is also why there's so much slice-of-life stuff that isn't directly plot relevant. This doesn't work for everyone, and I understand that.

    Thanks for the comments, and I'm glad you enjoyed the book, even if the unresolved hooks left you frustrated. Rest assured that you'll get to see most of that addressed in the sequel (or later).

      She clearly knew more about Keras than I did if **she’d was** involved in an attempted arrest.

      The older student frowned, scratching his chin. “Yeah, sure, I guess **he use** your old lane if he wants to.”

      Let me **know you feel** any resurgence of pain, though.”

  So, just finished this on audio book. Loved it.

  Wasn't aware of the direction the story was planning to take since I went in blind (I don't even read the summaries on audible. I was super intrigued when it started to feel like a JRPG with the tower. Then I was convinced it was going for a JRPG theme after the introduction of certain elements.

  Really like the story being told from the perspective of one person only, really lets you get into it. Also, not sure who chose to have Nick Podehl narrate it, but that was the right move. I'm convinced that man is some sort of god due to the vast variety of voices he has at his command and his ability to really put life into the characters.

  I actually came by this book because I was searching for things narrated by him and now I see was NOT let down.

  Can't wait to see where future installations in the series lead to. I think you have done an excellent job of building a foundation for a world that has multiple layers waiting to be peeled back and exposed.

  Eagerly awaiting the next book!

    Thank you for the kind words! I'm so glad you enjoyed it, and that the JRPG inspiration came through.

    Nick did a fantastic job. I asked my publisher for him because they hired him for my other books previously, and I was very impressed by the work he did with my other series. Also, because there will eventually be more crossover between the two series, so he will be familiar with the voices for both. =)

    I'll try to get the sequel ready soon!

    Bard attunement is on the list. =D 

    > How'd you come up with the title ?

    I debated the title for a long time. Right before release, I was still debating just calling it "Attuned", which was my working title that I'd used for the beta readers. I realized that "Attuned" doesn't really tell a prospective reader anything about the nature of the story, however, and I decided that I needed something that would set an appropriate tone.

    Ultimately, the book was mostly about magic being researched to the point of being integrated into virtually every element of society. I thought about Arthur C. Clarke's quote about "sufficiently advanced technology" and inverted it. I'm not the first person who came up with that inverted quote - TVTropes refers to it as "Sufficiently Analyzed Magic", for example - but it still felt like a good book title.
