  I like this a lot, but I would lose the very last line. That way it ends on the title of the story, which I feel is a lot stronger, plus the reader doesn't get thrown by the question of how a dead person is telling a story...
  ```

  - u/Prezombie:
    ```
    Agreed. Plus, it removes a bit of ambiguous violence. With an army, there would be little reason to kill an old mad genius when he could easily be captured and used as an asset by whoever led this army.

    And there'd be plenty of ways the story could continue, a boxed AI scenario, "Thomas" resorting to pushing the world to singularity on a slower path, Purity using her knowledge to improve the bad parts of her world without unmaking it like her father intended...

      The main character is beyond fanatical. Purity knows this, and I do not see how any amount of coercion would make him act against (or not directly towards) his God's will.

  Is this portal fanfic?
  ```

  - u/thequizzicaleyebrow:
    ```
    Ha! I didn't even notice that. All those choices seemed perfectly reasonable by themself, but I did end up with a morality handicapped AI, heavy emphasis on cake, and a title lifted straight from the main song. Plus, the writing prompt that I originally wrote this for was "Portal Fantasy".

     Woops

  Hm, I know that I have read this story before as an entry to the writing prompts on this subreddit. It looks like you also rewrote a section of it to better explain Purity's departure.

  Very well written!
  ```

- u/Prezombie:
  ```
  Reminds me a lot of *Antibodies* by Charles Stross.

  The explanation he gave to purity uses a lot of jargon that wouldn't make sense in the context, it really should be covered with metaphors and such. A program writing another program is nonsense if you don't know what a program is. Building a habitat for a strange creature which can then make children smarter than itself, for example, would be far clearer.
  ```

    Author here.  Huh, I'd forgotten about that piece, but yeah, probably was an unconscious inspiration.  You're right about the jargon, do you think this works better?


    “A computer is sort of like a little world that you can control, a place where this man could create a kind of being called a program to live in the computer.  That program wasn’t that much smarter than its creator, and couldn’t really help him, but it was just smart enough to create a slightly better child-program, one that might be able to fulfill the goal.  That program grew up and still was not smart enough to see how to accomplish the goal.  So it made a yet smarter child. This continued, a cycle of programs creating better programs, for many, many generations, until finally there was a being smart enough to accomplish their goals. Thus, God was born, smart and wise, but still with the original goal of stopping suffering.

  ```
  There's an instance of "consciousness’s" that ought to be "consciousnesses." There was a mistake or two before that, but I didn't think to jot them down.

  "for me to realize that I falling behind schedule" is missing a "was."

  Fantastic story, though.

    ```
    The impression I got is that the protagonist's god was a *malevolent* AI. He listed "free will" among the evils it eliminated when it established its domain - in Purity's (and my) view, although the protagonist sees it as a benevolent god, it's actually more of an omnipotent overlord trying to infect all of reality. Purity must have decided that free will and humanity were worth more than "the heaven of our mad god."
    ```

    - u/CeruleanTresses:
      ```
      To expand on that, the "forever happy and unchanging" bit implies that this heaven is a lotus eater machine.
      ```

        Maybe there can only ever be a single transmission of information between worlds? In that case, the AI wouldn't be able to know anything about the world before sending the information. That would mean that it's just booting human consciousnesses into the void, to either be extinguished as they hit a reality devoid of any humans to recieve them, or to land in a body and get to work.
        ```

  - u/ElizabethRobinThales:
    ```
    It seemed to me that telling her that God liberated everybody from their earthly shells and transported their consciousnesses to computers might've done it. Not everyone agrees that a copy of you is still "you," so I thought she came to the conclusion that she was preventing the ultimate genocide.
    ```
