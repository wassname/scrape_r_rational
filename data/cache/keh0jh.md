  Wasn't there just a story with this title posted about someone puking hippos?

  Oh ....
  I'd really like to see where this goes.

  For whatever it's worth, this first chapter grabs me a hell of a lot less than hippo-cougher did.

  Hmm. Reading through this, it implies there's a good amount of time travelers stuck dying at the edge point for medical science, until they Polly Sue their way into inventing immortality.
  ```

  - u/LazarusRises:
    ```
    I mean, by definition they all get stuck at the point of death over and over again til they figure out indefinite life extension. I don't think brute force counts as Polly Suing. And with 11 billion other pseudo-immortal time travelers to talk to, they can probably bootstrap it pretty quickly. Hard to see how this doesn't end up with 11B post-scarcity utopias within a couple millennia, since there's no incentive to screw over other time travelers.

      Now I'm wondering how many end up pseudo wire heading, just repeatedly eating the same bite of Choclate cake or orgasming over and over again.

  Sounds interesting.

  I don't understand OP.... How can there be any amount of real earths, all based on a hypothetical earth that you say doesn't exist? Am I missing something? Surely the hypothetical earth AKA the one we think we know, had to be real at some point, for all the others to be delivered from it, wouldn't it?
  ```

  - u/LazarusRises:
    ```
    Seems like the HE exists solely as a framing device for/origin point of all the other ones. It is the Earth that would have existed if nobody ever got to time travel, hence Hypothetical.
