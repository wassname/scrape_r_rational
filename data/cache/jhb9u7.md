  Note: There's also a new [discord](https://discord.gg/7TeHZUU) shared with MFD (and possibly other future projects). Most of the discourse tends to happen there, incidentally.

  ```
  Is there a way to read the old version of the first chapters/mechanics? And/or the discussion that lead to changing the system?
