## [Challenge Companion] Dungeons & Dragons

### Post:

D&D is many things, which is one the reasons I've found it to have enduring appeal. It's a set of rules, but it's also the set of worlds that the fluff (descriptions, pictures) and crunch (rules) suggest. Because there are many editions and many optional rulebooks (and rules), and because GMs and players are both free to invent and customize to their heart's content, the set of worlds that people consider to be "D&D" is *enormous*. I've played games set in grim magitek dystopias, 17th century Europe, games with firearms, games in ancient prehistory, or on distant moons.

(I don't think there's anything particularly wonderful about D&D as far as roleplaying games go, except that it was first and therefore set the standards. I've played dozens of roleplaying games and the biggest differences are the amount of crunch available and the conflict resolution mechanisms.)

*Anyway*, this is the companion thread to the weekly challenge, if you've got things you'd want to talk about here, have at it.

  I'm sure plenty of people here are already familiar with it, but there's [Harry Potter and the Natural 20](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20), where the main character is a munchkin from the D&D universe who gets brought into Harry Potter's universe through a spell gone wrong.

  EDIT: Also, there's [Mother of Learning](https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/1/Mother-of-Learning), which is rational fiction that takes place in a world similar to D&D.  The main difference appears to be that the spell system uses mana instead of memorization.

    Also, Mother of Learning has no magical healing.

      I think it does have magical healing, just not as all-powerful as D&D.
      I may be mistaken, but I've got an impression that priests do healing there.

  I normally assume that what we see in a game isn't really what happens, in the same way that when you watch a TV show and see the zipper on the monster costume, the monster doesn't actually have a zipper on it within the context of the shows' reality.

  Game mechanics such as experience levels are the equivalent of the zipper.  People in the game world cannot start making charts of exactly when they get certain abilities, and determine that they always get them in a specific order and that they have to kill a certain number of monsters between them.  Within the game world, all that happens is "character gradually gains abilities"; characters of the same class gain the abilities in the same fixed order because we have chosen not to simulate the game world to the level of detail needed to avoid that.  Millions of game world people don't *actually* all gain abilities in the same order and by killing monsters.

    I think if you take any joy in building characters or playing a balanced game, you need at least a partial moratorium on using the internet as a resource, at least for those players who are just going to look up the most maximally efficient build for their chosen class. It's not really surprising that the game gets unbalanced when hundreds of thousands of man-hours are spent on unbalancing it. Unlike a videogame though, a company that's printing books doesn't have a great way to fix a problem, or even identify that a problem exists. Margins are also a lot slimmer, which means less playtesting gets done. So I mostly try to stay away from making optimal builds and encourage others to do the same, especially because I end up depriving myself of a fair amount of the fun of character building.

    I'd suggest GURPS, but you've already said that you don't like it. All my other favorite systems are for other genres or are less mechanically deep.

      On the other hand, the internet can help you avoid accidental unbalance. 3.5 in particular is notorious for its newbie traps and wildly unbalanced PHB. A good understanding of all the options and their relative power lets you choose more balanced options if that's what you want to do (in 3.5, the most balanced classes are relatively obscure).

      As for what the game designers could have done, they could ensure balance at the expense of versatility by doing what they did in 4e: remove all open ended powers and design all classes using the same, video-game like mechanics. Whether that's a good thing is up for debate: 4e isn't very popular.

    I've heard good things about this one https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeon_World It's also free.

  I should probably mention [the Tippyverse](http://www.giantitp.com/forums/showthread.php?222007-The-Definitive-Guide-to-the-Tippyverse-By-Emperor-Tippy) as one example of someone taking the rules-as-intended and trying to make a setting that takes into account some of the things possible. I don't really agree with some of Tippy's starting assumptions (namely the ease with which people can get XP and using traps for beneficial spells) but it's an interesting exploration of the consequences of the rules nonetheless, without totally dipping into the insanity that comes from uncharitable application of RAW.

  I've never understood the appeal of munchkinning d&d. Its very obviously not designed with the intention of creating a consistent universe but to make games work, with the DM altering them as needed. Can anyone explain the appeal?
  ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    You'd need to define what you mean by munchkining.

    If you mean it in the sense of what *Harry Potter and the Natural 20* or *The Two Year Emperor* do, or the more abstract exercises on the character optimization boards, then I think most of the appeal is in seeing just how far the system can be stretched. It's the same impulse that leads people to send jet-powered cars hurtling across the salt flats in order to reach a new top speed. There's a particular joy in optimizing within a bounded system, and in laying out a proof of concept. It's also a thought exercise that offer low-hanging fruit and easy optimizations that don't resemble actual intellectual work as much as is required in systems or settings less ripe for abuse.

    If you mean *in game*, then I think that's mostly about "winning". D&D doesn't have to be a power fantasy, but it often is, so people want to accumulate as much power as possible.
    ```

    - u/Uncaffeinated:
      ```
      It's not just a matter of making numbers bigger - a lot of the fun in theoretical optimization is uncovering poorly worded rules and coming up with crazy tricks that noone has ever thought of before. After all, anyone can make Pun-pun, but there's still gems left to be discovered. Heck, even if a trick is completely useless, it can still be fun if it does something unique.

      I like to think that I was the first person to discover the utility of illiterate Wizards or how the obscure spell Infallible Servant has completely unintended uses.

  So I wrote some handbooks on doing some of the sorts of things that you see in post-scarcity fiction and in post-cyberpunk and things like that in D&D 3.5e.  These might be useful for people.
  First, I wrote a guide on making transhumans using D&D 3.5e rules [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z9NJIs751Af3i0IEIJwCkIp9H9YFiZYZ7u-wmYVaheI/edit).
  Next, I wrote a thing about making airships and powerful robots and sentient constructs [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14zilT4WGOyHM0AfpG4-GmD2FkgDg1HZ9HC1cTleQHds/edit).
  And finally, I wrote a writeup of how to basically make a whole post-scarcity society using D&D 3.5e rules [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aG4P3dU6WP3pq8mW9l1qztFeNfqQHyI22oJe09i8KWw/edit).
