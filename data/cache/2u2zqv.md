  First, thanks to Draconomial [for the reccomendation](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2tww4h/ffrst_the_waves_arisen_ch3/co449dc).

  This is another fanfic where Naruto uses shadow clones to prank people in progressively more amusing ways. I put "proto" in front of the RT and MK tags, because while he does munchkin and use the scientific method the fic pulls tons of random stuff out of its hat (mainly to give Naruto things to play with). Enough that it doesn't actually explore the space of things Naruto could be doing better or more intelligently with the original constraints. 

  It feels like an [RT][MK] Naruto, but really it's a different optimization problem altogether. I found it a ton of fun but there are some issues. Namely there's a notable lack of copy editing, and relatively little effort put into characterization of secondary and tertiary characters. When Naruto has a cool idea, others seem to go along with it with surprisingly little resistance.

    I'm on chapter 8 right now, and enjoying it very much.  There are a few power ups that I wish were not there because I think they are unreasonable, make things too easy, and there's no justification for them.  Specifically:

    * [ ](#s "An abandoned house with a training ground *two miles* underground.  And the training ground is also two miles wide.")
    * [ ](#s "There's a network of tunnels coming from the house and leading all over Konoha and outside into the forest.")
    * [ ](#s "Naruto sends his clones out to scavenge the woods--reasonable.  They come back with tons of kunai, senbon, swords, etc--ok, pretty reasonable.  They also come back with not one but two (possibly three) different summoning contract scrolls.  Not reasonable.")
    * [ ] (#s "Naruto discovers that he can't kawarimi (teleportation by substitution) over short distances, but he *can* do it over long distances...like, a couple of miles long.")
    * [ ](#s "Naruto recruits Iruka as an adviser, which I really liked.  It's not something you see in most fanfics and it makes a lot of sense.  On Naruto's behalf, Iruka goes to the Hokage and says 'Hey, I can't tell you why but will you give me some resources to help Naruto?'.  The Hokage writes him a literal blank check saying 'The holder of this note is acting with my complete authority, any order he gives are my orders, and everything about this is a highest-level secret.'")
    * [ ](#s "Naruto's version of the henge (self-transformation technique) is physical, not just an illusion.  This is supported by canon, but I had always assumed that it was like this for everyone.  Apparently not, because Iruka is flabbergasted when he discovers it.")
    * [ ](#s "Apparently, in this story henging into smaller and larger forms is not easy / not possible.  When Iruka sees Naruto henge into a cat he goes 'oh my god, that's not possible!'  I'm sure the justification is 'Naruto has so much more chakra than everyone else' but it feels like baloney.")

    These things bug me when I trip over them, but if I make the effort to let go on those issues then the story is a lot of fun.

      Same feeling I had; it has a very slight touch of Mary-Sue where everything feels just a biiiiiiit too conveniently easy. There's a particularly glaring bit a few chapters past where your examples end and I had to take a break and read something else for a while, but like you said, a fun read overall.

      Interestingly, I've read one of the author's other works, and now that I think about it had just a little bit of the same problem.

        Which bit was that? The gambling bit? If so, yeah that's a bit much. (Unless later on there's an explanation? Just now reading that bit, so might be an actual justification later?)

    I am reading this right now. You are right in that it could do with some revision but it is amusing to read none the less.
