  Ok, time for my personal views rather than modfascism.

  I think we have a lot to be worried about, but at the same time, a lot to be excited about, and in a nongeneric way.  Specifically, I think that the specific societies which are falling into insanity are not acting *chaotically*, but in fact acting *lawfully*: falling into totalitarian manias is *what societies do* when put under severe economic and social strain by their own elites.  The United States, Greece, Israel, Egypt, India, and the Arab world (and that's just to my own personal knowledge), yes, all have severe social-rationality problems.  They are also all places where the common population is, in some form, under deliberate manipulation by a contemptuous elite who see the commoners as *basically unnecessary* and not morally valuable.

  The Arab world was ruled by straightforwardly exploitative dictators for decades.  It has then erupted into the same social phenomena that created modern Europe: Enlightenment and fascism, right alongside each other.  This is sociology operating as we know and understand it.  Things will probably calm down if someone can make food and fuel cheap again *without* political despotism.

  America and Greece are under severe internal economic strains by neoliberal elites who view the commoners as Too Unproductive To Live.  "Strangely" enough, the reaction against this sort of thinking in the United States has already started among the currently-indispensable professional classes and elites: they do seem to remember the Great Depression, World War II, and the Postwar Period, and appear to remember the lesson that class compromise on the part of the elite can often be a lot less costly and more controlled than total social breakdown.  As the younger generation (who weren't even adults during the last neoliberal growth-periods) gains voting influence, a return to *some* form of social rationality is likely by sheer demography.  Already the *rhetoric* is shifting, as was noted in the review: when one party talks about infrastructure, science, and the common good, and the other one cites a fringe philosopher with utopian visions nobody outside a narrow band of followers considers very utopian (ie: Ayn Rand), *and it used to mostly be the other way around*, a shift is already happening.

  A similar process is even happening in Germany and Northern Europe regarding the crises in Southern Europe.  We're probably not getting the full-blown socialist revolution my tribe tends to hope for, but we will likely see a return to some form of Keynesianism or social-democracy in many countries, especially as roboticization of production becomes politicized.

  Israel (where I am, hence its inclusion :-p) is *weirdly* stable right now.  Our government has no sane or moral program whatsoever, we have massive demographic issues, and we're surrounded by war.  But everyone goes about their daily lives calmly.  I really need to remember to get back to translating HPMoR into Hebrew so we can start counter-indoctrinating Haredi youth for the lulz.

  In the *rest* of the world, globalized growth is continuing apace.  Like it or not, this is meaning protests, riots, and revolutions for increased labor rights and increased democracy all around the world, at a pace never before seen in human history.  The elimination of both traditional languages and communication barriers is, on the one hand, homogenizing the world's cultures into something that nobody really predicted or wanted (my tribe on the hard-left thinks it's horrid, overly commercial, rootless, and yucky), *but*, just like the Romans in *Life of Brian*, it's damn well bringing peace (or at least a reduction in violent death) and education (or at least, the new ideas of the bourgeois epoch) everywhere it goes.  From my tribe's perspective, it's a bit like watching an empirical test of historical materialism in real time, and we're seeing it *pass* the test.  From the rationalist tribe's perspective, it's like watching an empirical test of whether human values converge under extrapolation, and they kinda do... admittedly, they converge into the stuff you see in YouTube comments, but they're *converging*.

  So overall, we are living in interesting times, good for some people, bad for many people, and more rationality can definitely help tilt the playing field towards good.  Even on the issue of existential risks, it's hard to actually claim that there was some previous time when we did *more* about them than we do now, and that's even before we get into the potentially utopian benefits of some of the stuff under development.

  First of all, despite this being a review of a nonfiction work, I'm going to approve it.  When /u/seraphnb handed this subreddit to me, one of the requirements was that we *not* toe the easy, dismissive, "Blue vs Green IS THE MINDKILLER" party line here.

  HOWEVER!  Ground rules:

  * Is and ought are not allowed to mix without meta-ethical justification.  You can state a position, but you must make explicit all your normative presuppositions for that position.  For instance, "universal health care is affordable in every country and has a higher preference-utilitarian score than empirically-observed non-universal market-pricing systems for health-care, therefore we should prefer universal health care to market-pricing health-care" is acceptable.  "Universal health-care must be prevented at all costs because it expands government" is **not** acceptable: you've sneaked in the normative *value* that we must *minimize government*.

  * Likewise, you *will* end up posting something based on tribalistic loyalties.  *You are human*; this is what humans do.  Again: your tribalism must be explicitly noted rather than sneaked in under cover of night.  "I oppose universal health-care because the rest of my Republican tribe does" *is* an acceptable statement.  "Solidarity against American imperialism in Syria!" is *not* acceptable: you've failed to specify which tribe you belong to, and therefore have no grounds for demanding others join your tribe.

  * For God's sake, *try* to stay focused on the issue of rationality.  If there's a core point here from the point of view of MIRI/CFAR/LW "rationalists", it's that social irrationality has grown from irritating AM-radio cancer to a strong causative factor in failing to address existential risks.  Note the keywords: remember that Rationalists Care About Existential Risks, and *stay focused*.

  These kinds of discussions should be considered a kind of rationalist weightlifting: we are attempting to be rational about things that are very hard to be rational about.

  Have fun.
