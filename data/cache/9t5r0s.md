  I feel like there are millions of lists on the internet, plus speculative fiction and movies. Are you hoping for a specific topic or kind of discussion not covered in all of that?

  ```
  Programs are buggy, reflect the biases of their programmers, and are primarily aimed to benefit people who can hire programmers.  There's no reason to expect this to stop. AI lets us make programs with more impact in more contexts that matter more to people. These programs will still be buggy, biased, and designed to benefit billionaires, but will have greater collateral damage than before.

  Also at some unknown level of sophistication, AI will suddenly become radically more capable than previously, and will carry out its stupid buggy goals with vastly superhuman intelligence.
