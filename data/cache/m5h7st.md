  Fun podcast, it's funny the things that they infer from the early parts of the story that turn out to be, well, maybe not fully correct.

  Could I clear something up that's not a spoiler and will hopefully prevent a bunch of speculation about something that they misinterpret? There's no meaningful connection between the placement of the stats and the placement of the skills. The skills are mostly ordered so that the physical skills are at the top, mental in the middle, and social on the bottom, but that's the only real pattern. If woodworking was at the top instead of one handed weapons, or even if the skills were completely shuffled, nothing would change mechanically.

  I already wanted to beg them to do this, but I didn't because WtC isn't finished yet.

  What are the chances that the story won't be finished before the podcast reaches the current point?

    At the rate they're doing things they're set to get to the current location in 3 years, so I think it's very likely, unless they dramatically increase their rate or Alexander Wales stops writing for an extended period of time.

      That’s sort of happening though, right? No update since Thanksgiving? Do we know when the hiatus ends?

        The last update was in December. Lately he has slowed down a bit, but it’s not on hiatus I don’t think.

          Iirc he's in the US and had to watch that country tear itself apart with covid and all its politics stuff. Not a good environmemt for keeping a clear head and pushing through work, especially given how depressing some of the recent parts of the story have been alone.

          Has he really slowed? In my experience he writes roughly the same amounts of chapters per month and the delays are due to how many chapters he decides to post at once. The last badge was quite large.

            Absolutely. It's been last year things started to slow down. For your average writer it's still an okay speed, I think (going by the chapter spreadsheet the chapters coming in a few days were at a speed at roughly 400 words/day - before that he was at well over a thousand if my memory isn't going completely bonkers)

  Woah, this author goes deep on that Elder Scrolls comparison.

  A seriously deep-cut topic for a podcast. Anyone doing anything with Clubhouse, BTW?
