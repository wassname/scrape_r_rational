  This story first came to my attention via [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/25hbpa/dc_nope_the_anime_a_short_comic_about_a/chhhgiv) and, after reading thirty chapters and enjoying all of them, I have now posted it here.

  A quick description is that the main character can percieve the Plot and must try to avoid it as much as possible while managing another unfortunate condition. My only problems with it are inherent to the source Naruto universe, and some familiarity with that is advised.

  Found it via that thread as well, and I am thoroughly amused. What I've read so far is excellent.
  Though the inherent problem with someone who is trying to avoid Plot becoming a shinobi isâ€¦confusing.
