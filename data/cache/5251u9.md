  Funny thing, better solution you propose is [exacly what happens in comics you complain about.]( https://qph.is.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-78c02092653ffc25064a24fcfd69bc95?convert_to_webp=true)

  Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne has lots of heroes that are protagonist or antagaonist depending on your point of view. Illidan, Kael'thas, Lady Vashj, Maiev, Sylvanas. They took full advantage of player switching sides.

    Nice, good to see that was used at some point. It still makes that  version of Lex a terrible "genius," but a better character than one that just dismisses it.

    And yeah, Warcraft 3 and the expansion was honestly one of the best video game stories I ever played. It's a shame WoW drove its lore deeper into the ground with every expansion.

  I couldn't agree more about Magneto. I think that he would be the most promising candidate for a rational protagonist in an X-Men fanfic. Not necessarily as a hero, though if you include some of the stuff from the comics (such as alien invaders) it'd be easy to cast him in that light.

  In the movies, his power is massively underutilised. At one point [X-Men 3 spoiler ](#s "he lifts the Golden Gate bridge, which weighs around 381 million kg"). That makes him astonishingly powerful, and in other scenes he is shown to have fantastic fine control (though it's implied the degree of control scales inversely with the total mass/volume he's working with).

  What he should be doing is manufacturing weapons or powering generators or something (or dropping large chunks of metal from hundreds of metres in the air if you really need to just destroy a base). Hell, just put bullet-shaped chunks of metal through the brain of all your opponents, or entomb them if that wouldn't work.

  Jean Gray and Professor Xavier have similar problems with underutilisation, but as the "good guys" you expect that sort of thing. If they solved their problems the most efficient way, either there'd be no conflict or it would be portrayed as crossing a moral event horizon.

  Villain protagonists are perhaps the most interesting to me, and Magneto is likely the best rational villain from a non-rational franchise.

    Yeah, as I mentioned in a previous episode, anyone with psychic and telekenetic abilities should be grossly powerful, but it makes sense for them not to abuse them due to morals or the lack of proper mindset.  Magneto can do such ridiculous things with his powers that a rational story from his perspective either has to find justifiable reasons to limit him that are never explained in the canon works... or have him win in the first few chapters and then face some new threat greater than his powers can immediately help him through.

  My favorite villain from Justice League was always Darkseid, just from his sheer inhumanity. He is the ultimate evil that seeks to destroy or dominate all of existence for the sake of it, and every word he speaks is drenched with such arrogance you can tell he's talking down to you. The only reason you exist is because he permits it, for now. He's the case of a shallow, evil villain completely embracing his role and actively desiring it, which is kind of terrifying.

  My favorite version of Lex Luthor, so far, is from the Young Justice cartoon. While he doesn't have a huge role and isn't even really the main villain, they absolutely nailed his intelligence and personality. He always acts like he's in control even when he's in mortal danger, to the point where he uses his own smugness as a tool to manipulate his adversaries. I totally believe that he is a criminal mastermind that has never been arrested.

  The best example I've seen for a villain written as if they were the protagonist is Kingpin from the Daredevil show. He was such an amazing character it didn't matter if his plan was never fully explained, and despite the horrible things he did I felt empathy for him at every step. He was a monster, without a doubt, but he really believed in what he was doing, had people he cared about, and was even afraid of becoming a villain when he didn't want to be one.

  Kilgrave from Jessica Jones is just as well done, though in a completely different way. He's a completely unrepentant monster that believes people only exist to serve his sadistic pleasures, and the story is so good at putting you into his warped mind that he never feels shallow. He also ties in perfectly to the protagonist's conflict over victimization and the show's themes about sexual abuse and stalking.

  I wish I could come up with favorite villains that weren't from superhero stories, or superhero noir in the case of JJ, but most of my favorite stories are more about the protagonist facing an internal conflict, a nebulous antagonist, or an ambiguous situation. Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood has great villains, but I still found the conflict with them to be secondary to the personal struggles of the other characters.

    Yeah, there are some fantastic antagonists from manga/anime and books and movies, but for whatever reason superhero stories come to mind quicker than most when I consider villains.  Hell, Quirrel is one of my favorite antagonists ever, but he's not even really an antagonist for 90% of HPMOR.

  Wizard from Wicked (musical). Even though he's mostly absent villain it's clear how big impact indirectly he had on heroine life. His lies filled her with fales hope and made her better person. And when finally confronted he doesn't drop the act. His [villain song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_c4JuzT_X5E) is all about how he is not bad person. He invoke everything that cast him in better light, and even for a moment convince heroine to his side. It's never explained if what he said is truth or tailored lies.

  Adversary from Fables. He has great backstory, slowly going from good intentions to despicable villany, never stoping thinking of himself as a hero. He munchins his fairy tail powers and goes to conquer multiverse with them. Even than he makes every possible precaution and listens to advices of his generals. And he trully loves his children.

    Yep. The Wizard gains an extra dimension as an interesting antagonist when you know that he's [Spoilers](#s "Elphaba's father, and see the sorrow he feels upon realizing that he helped kill her.")
