  **Summary/Teaser**

  Aaron Smith-Teller works in a kabbalistic sweatshop in Silicon Valley, where he and hundreds of other minimum-wage workers try to brute-force the Holy Names of God. All around him, vast forces have been moving their pieces into place for the final confrontation. An overworked archangel tries to debug the laws of physics. Henry Kissinger transforms the ancient conflict between Heaven and Hell into a US-Soviet proxy war. A Mexican hedge wizard with no actual magic wreaks havoc using the dark art of placebomancy. The Messiah reads a book by Peter Singer and starts wondering exactly what it would mean to do as much good as possible...

  Aaron doesn't care about any of this. He and his not-quite-girlfriend Ana are engaged in something far more important â€“ griping about magical intellectual property law. But when a chance discovery brings them into conflict with mysterious international magic-intellectual-property watchdog UNSONG, they find themselves caught in a web of plots, crusades, and prophecies leading inexorably to the end of the world.

  So, Comet West is the Comet King, right?  The first comment onsite appears to assume that the Comet King is Jalaketu West, but this strikes me as questionable given the overall timeline.  Are we to believe that Sohu was conceived when her father was five years old?

    ```
    Clearly the Comet King was born as a fully-fledged adult (or, more accurately, he grew up super-fast, as echoed in that one comment from that one doctor).  Alternately, Sohu isn't his literal biological daughter.

    Jala appears in the [prologue epigraph](http://unsongbook.com/book-i-genesis/) as someone who knew the haMephorash, and seems to be the same person as the Comet King, although it's a little ambiguous.
