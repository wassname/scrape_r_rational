### Post:

## Last Time

[Last time,](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/62byv5/biweekly_challenge_weirdtopia/) the prompt was "Weirdtopia", and our winner was /u/CaptainLoggers, with [their story](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/62byv5/biweekly_challenge_weirdtopia/dg1ysjj/), "A Good Day's Work". Go read it now!

##### This Time

This time the challenge will be **Twenty Minutes in the Future**. Write a story set a relatively short time in the future, where changes to society are extrapolations on what's currently going on in the world of science, technology, politics, etc. The term "eerily plausible" often comes up for this kind of story, since they usually don't fall so far into the future that they're pure speculation. Remember that prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

The winner will be decided **Wednesday, April 26th.** You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

##### Rules

* 300 word minimum, no maximum. Post as a link to Google Docs, pastebin, Dropbox, etc. **This is mandatory.**

* No plagiarism, but you're welcome to recycle and revamp your own ideas you've used in the past.

* Think before you downvote.

* Winner will be determined by "best" sorting.

* Winner gets reddit gold, special winner flair, and bragging rights. Five-time winners get even more special winner flair, and their choice of prompt if they want it.

* All top-level replies to this thread should be submissions. Non-submissions (including questions, comments, etc.) belong in the companion thread, and will be aggressively removed from here.

* Top-level replies must be a link to Google Docs, a PDF, your personal website, etc. It is suggested that you include a word count and a title when you're linking to somewhere else.

* In the interest of keeping the playing field level, please refrain from cross-posting to other places until after the winner has been decided.

* No idea what rational fiction is? [Read the wiki!](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index)

##### Next Time

Next time the challenge will be **Monster Mash**. Your choice of mummies, vampires, werewolves, or Frankenstein('s monster). For extra credit, use them all together. If you have no idea what I'm talking about, [see this TVTropes page](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterMash), though you don't have to use all of them at once if you don't want to. Remember that prompts are to inspire, not to limit.
