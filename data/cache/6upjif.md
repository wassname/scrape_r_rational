## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  You have a power to change any liquid into clean drinking water as long as you have a line of sight. You can change unlimited volume at any given time as long as you can see all of it at once. Otherwise you will only affect a part of it you can see. For instance if you look at a deep lake of oil you will only affect first couple of feet  from a surface area as you can't  penetrate all the way down to the bottom. 

  Your goal is to become millionaire in less than 1 year. How would you go about it.

    Win the Randi Prize.

    After that, dispose of radiological waste.

      Radiological waste is probably the best I was thinking in similar direction. Maybe add to that being able to clean oil spillages and charge for those services too. 

      Rand Price was cancelled in 2015 according to wikipedia so that one is gone.

    1. Reveal your ability and use it for good.

    2. Gather the goodwill and resources go get into space.

    3. Threaten to turn a significant portion of the world's oceans into freshwater if your demands aren't met.

    4. ???

    5. Profit.

    Look someone in the eyes. Their eyes turn into clean drinking water. This is probably fatal. 

    You can now take missions to be the best assassin/sniper ever. You don't even need a weapon, just stand on top of a building and look at your target. The moment you make eye contact, even from super far away, they die a horrible death. The police are baffled, unable to make heads or tails of what's going on. 

    Once you gain enough funds, you start making your own money. You invest in companies under false names and then murder rival companies so your investments quickly become monopolies. You stealthily grow and amass a hidden empire, becoming a major shareholder in every company and country you desire while murdering all the rest.

      Is it? [It seems like plenty of people literally remove their own eyes, and still survive](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2860527/). Especially with such an instantaneous and "clean" procedure as eye->water transformation, I'd imagine that as long as the victim received medical care in a timely fashion (which is likely, if your targets are high-profile), they would definitely survive.

      On the other hand, those targets' careers would be over; the time it takes to adapt to blindness, would probably eliminate them from any higher-up political or business position (for a while, at least). So in some ways, it's maybe an improvement on assassination? In that you can remove targets from positions of power, without actually committing murder.

      How much of their intraocular fluid can you actually see?
      ```

    - u/Grand_Strategy:
      ```
      As mentioned at best that would cause blindness. Other issue is how well do you know secret services and underground world. For instance I doubt that going to MI6 or CIA and saying "I have power to blind any person I look at" would go as well as you plan. Chances are that you would be classed as danger to the state power to dispose of president or a qeen just by looking into their eyes is not something that would be taken lightly.  

      Secret services have 100s of people who could kill targets reasons why people like Putin or Kim are not assassinated isn't because we don't  have means to do so but because possible consequences of those would be huge and unpredictable.

    Becoming a millionaire is not hard. Cleaning up radioactive waste will probably do it on its own.

    But consider liquid helium. If I can turn *that* into clean and presumably room-temperature drinking water, then I'm breaking conservation of energy, by creating new energy...

    For those (like me) who haven't seen this before, here is the setting according to the sidebar of the sub! Just to consolidate this in one easy to read space:

    *You are contacted by an omnipotent entity. a dangerously bored omnipotent entity. It sends you across the multiverse you go on adventures to keep it entertained. Every world you arrive in you must survive for 10 years by whatever means you see fit. From there you can go home, stay in your current world or move on to a new one.*

    *You can keep your new abilities, gear, powers, friends, etc. from one adventure to the next. If you die, however, you are sent home immediately. You keep what you have so far, but your multiversal adventuring days are over.*

    *The Goal? well the original goal was to reach a sufficient power level to survive in the most dangerous of universes (like dragon ball z, Warhammer 40k, etc). At that point the entity would grant you the 'Planeswalker spark' to let you freely travel the universe at your leisure... but to some, the journey itself is it's own reward.*
    ```

    Pre-edit: I forgot that they provide perks when you enter a world and/or rewards when you leave, so everything is based on the premise that you enter as yourself at a time/place roughly of your choosing with only what you have, and leave with what you can take with you.

    1. Culture (Iain M Banks):  Try to get ageless immortality and Special Circumstances training if you can.  Otherwise, just get good health, powerful tech, and all the rest.
    2. The Long Earth (Terry Pratchett + Steven Baxter):  Get a stepper.  It's a small thing to spend 10 years on, but totally worth it for defense, infiltration, and escape.  The design can also be traded in the new worlds you go to if you're in need of money or chaos.
    3. The Name of the Wind (Patrick Rothfuss): Sympathy + Sygaldry.  Naming and alchemy, if you can do it.  I'm pretty sure you can make perpetual motion machines at this point, and should now be able to make some money anywhere.
    4. Warbreaker (Brandon Sanderson): You have enough powers and skills to get at least the 2000 Breaths you need to get agelessness, toxin/disease immunity, and minor perception powers.  If you can get some spare Breaths to animate objects with that's a nice bonus.

    That should be a safe progression that doesn't depend on genetics (Avatar, Harry Potter, etc.), infrastructure (most technology), or location (god-powered magic, geography/population linked magic, ranger skills linked to a biome).  You are also ageless and immune to most non-physical types of harm so the urgency has worn off.

    I wrote a story for jumpchain a while back, to try to learn how to write. Given the restrictions involved in that one, though, it could probably be described as the opposite of munchkinry.

    Instead, here are a few common tricks for jumpchaining:

    Blue Feather (Harvest Moon) + Cheat Mode (Minecraft): Take anybody as companions, so long as you don't mind being married to each person you bring with you this way.

    Let's Give It A Boost (Unholy Heights) + Cheat Mode (Minecraft): Double the potency of any single "item" once every two months.

    Any Alternate Forms + This Is, In Fact My Final Form (Sword Art Online): Freely mix and match the qualities of all your forms together. Bonus for Song of Triumph (Aquaria), which allows you to take the form of any enemy you defeat.

    Any Immortality Perk + Any Power That Grows Over Time + Generic Xianxia: Generic Xianxia has a drawback that allows you to stay in that universe for an arbitrarily long timeframe. This allows you to develop your powers as much as you'd like.

    Also, I'd like to note that Eclipse Phase allows you to obtain a fully general AI, which can easily be trained for friendliness over its initial development phase.
