  Is this manga really worth reading from a rationalist point of view? I only hear good things about this manga but didn't had time to give it a try.

    IMO it's rationalist in the same way that Sherlock Holmes is rationalist, but people on the sub like it so I keep on posting it here.

      That's just a tad harsh, isn't it?

      Certainly, both are first and foremost *clever*, not rationalist. Nevertheless, as far as thinking goes, *Neverland* does seem rather more grounded about it.
