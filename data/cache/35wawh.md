## The Flash! (Barry Allen-Verres)

### Post:

I've been thoroughly impressed by this subs ability to rationalize fiction. Let's try and finish our DCU. I have a dream, of a Flash story where "because Speed Force" isn't the only answer to every question about power, plot, physics, or character motivation. A dream that Plot-Induced Stupidity isn't required for Speedsters to fight non-Speedsters. A dream involving quantifiable numbers applied to exactly how fast The fastest man alive is.

Now, I think first priority is figuring out what exactly the Speed Force is, and what exactly can it do. My take on this is much the same as the Higgs Field which grants every particle in the universe its mass. Manipulating the association with it could make things functionally weightless, or allow lightspeed travel. I think the Speed Force is a similar field that grants every object its individual acceleration, and Speedsters get their powers from altering their connection with the field. This actually allows Flash to keep most of his powers, as well as giving logical scientific limits to what he can do.

Second problem, FTL doesn't mean time travel in DC. There's an entirely separate Time Barrier which is much faster than the Light Barrier. There's also, from what I can tell (correct me when I'm wrong), a Dimension Barrier, a Space Barrier, a Reality Barrier, a Life Barrier, and finally a Speed Force Barrier. At least a few of these have major logical ramifications. Let's figure out which ones we really need and apply numerical values to exactly how fast the rest have to be. I'd say the only important ones are Light, Time, and Life, the last of which relates to the Black Flash who is my personal favorite representation of a reaper in comics.

Speaking of villains, we have to take a hard look at the Rogues Gallery. We have to figure out how each of them poses a threat to someone who can run FTL and travel through time, without relying on him to stand in the path of a Boomerang or other such nonsense. A lot of them need upgrades, or optimised origins. For one, let's give Captain Cold access to actual Absolute Zero, and all the horrors that that entails. Now he can freeze molecule-thick walls of air to be stronger than steel. Now he can make patches of floor so cold that once you step on, you can't step off. Maybe Grodd can telepathically steal brain-processing power from those around him, explaining why he's as smart as he is and simultaneously making him exceedingly more dangerous by stupidifying everyone within range. Can anyone figure out a rational take on Mirror^Master?

  I love the Flash. He would be my favorite superhero ... but his powers don't make much sense, and his villains are pretty lame. I have a piece of Flash fanfic sitting in a folder somewhere (titled "Flashback" because it's a time loops story - god I'm clever) which is never going to be finished.

  Good to luck to anyone that wants to try it, but it's going to be an uphill battle. You either need to power the Flash down by a huge amount, or power the threats he faces up by a huge amount, maybe both.

    I was thinking both. There are ways of planning against an FTL opponent, regardless of what people on r/whowouldwin believe. So given the right set of tools, you only have to slow him down enough to where there's actual travel time for the villains to stand a chance.

  There is a story called "Fall of Doc Future" found [here](http://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/82363551272/fall-of-doc-future-contents) that may not be exactly what you're looking for, but it does involve slightly less physics defying speedster *named* Flicker. It isn't set in DCU, though I don't know how important that is to you.

    I second this motion - that is one of the few rational/rationalist works I've read where the rationality didn't interfere with the characterization or the plot (they largely drove it).

    Does it have anything in common with Flash other than following someone who is fast and possibly time travel? Speed Force? FTL footraces? Telepathic gorillas?

    In all seriousness though, I'll check it out. Thanks.

      I believe telepathic gorillas did make an appearance. But mostly it's about a superhero world where mental powers and hyperspeed are as powerful as they deserve to be. I'm a huge fan of it, as well as the sequel and change of followups.

        Glad to hear that a number of people here like my stories.  Flicker was indeed inspired by the Flash--in particular this quote about him (in an old obscure issue of Swamp Thing by Alan Moore):

        "There is a man who moves so fast his life is an endless gallery of statues."

        I wondered what that would be like, and what it would take to have a vaguely plausible world with a speedster who could go close to the speed of light in it... and I created Flicker.  Similarly, Doc was inspired by my frustration with how 'smart' characters were portrayed in fiction.

        The first two novels, "The Fall of Doc Future" and "Skybreaker's Call" are complete and available in web-serial form here: http://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/62787551366/stories

        I'm working on the 3rd book now, "The Maker's Ark", and posting new chapters every two weeks.

        There isn't a battle really worthy of Flicker's power until the second book, I'm afraid, as it took some doing to set up. 8-)

        Oh, and there are telepaths, but no gorillas yet.  Sorry.

          Dang. I'm actually getting interested in this. 

          I DON'T NEED THIS I HAVE TOO MUCH TO DO OH NOOOOO...

      It does not have anything in common with the Flash, no. But if you want an idea of how dangerous a speedster can get - even without FTL or time-travel or vibrating through walls or any similarly dubious uses of her power - then you ought to check it out.
      ```

- u/DCarrier:
  ```
  I think first you need to flesh out the mechanics of super speed. Does it involve high kinetic energy and momentum, with all of the destructive potential that brings? If he carries a magnet with him or gets a static charge somehow, does it result in an EMP? Can he think at super speeds? Does he have super reflexes, but no real conscious thought at that speed? Does have ordinary reflexes, so he has to plan out his entire path before running and he has no way of reacting to obstacles? Does he have less obvious results of the power, such as being able to vibrate through walls and wear pants made of goes fast?
  ```

  ```
  For Mirror Master, perhaps he ought to have a native ability to trap people in/draw things out of pocket universes, and he simply has a conceptual limitation involving the use of mirrors (which might be overcome eventually)?
  ```

- u/ArgentStonecutter:
  ```
  The most rational super speed power would be on where you accelerate your personal time. The result would be something like a more portable version of Sinclair's "time machine" in Larry Niven's _Arm_.
  ```

- u/Izeinwinter:
  ```
  Super-speed is already a complete and utter game-breaker. Applying rationality to it is just going to turn it into a munchkining exercise. 

  So.. Very limited super speed.

  "Esprit the Hyper-escalier"; Thanks to an encounter with an alien auto-doctor that decided to treat a neurological disorder the obvious way, your brain has been scooped out and replaced by an equal-sized chunk of computronium running a Moravec upload of your gray matter with the problem edited out. Computronium is, of course, orders of magnitude more efficient at computing than neural tissue, so even after paying the emulation "tax", this gives you the ability to slow your subjective perception of time down by a factor of up to 951 to one. 
  This does *not* make you able to move 951 times as fast. Your body is flesh and bone. At maximum speedup, you are effectively a lock-in case inside a statue that responds at the speed of a glacier. You can do as much thinking as you like and can tolerate in this state however.
  ```

  - u/forrestib:
    ```
    That's... not anything close to like The Flash in almost any way. You just created a brand new superhero that has nothing to do with this thread. That's not even super speed. That's super cognition. That's like saying Rational Thor would just be a guy who's immune to lightning. If you're gonna try and sell me a concept for Rational Flash, at least make it someone supersonic next time.
