## Comedy Theory

### Post:

Hi, everyone! This is off topic, but I really want to discuss it with you guys, and I think you will find the subject interesting.

For the past several months I have been trying to understand how comedy works, to figure out a step-by-step process for coming up with jokes. I think I'm onto something, and I have written an article about it:

This is my first attempt to express the ideas I have about it. I'm not a neuroscientist, and my theory can be totally incomplete and mistaken, but I think it has some useful epiphanies that explain a lot of things.

I am still working on it and trying to figure it out, and now I'm looking for some feedback/ideas, I really want to talk to some smart people about the subject.

Please let me know what you think. Any criticism/questions that you have, anything that is unclear or can be better explained, any thoughts/ideas would be very valuable to me!

  This helps to elucidate my observation that the more familiar I am with a comedy, the more the original comedic joy of watching it is replaced with an entirely different-feeling nostalgic joy.

  Comedic timing is both very universal and utterly lost in text-based comedy.  I don't think it's ever the sole active ingredient in a joke, but it's very commonly a vital one, intensifying comedy severely.

  I think you should qualify that this theory is only about 1 type of comedy, while there are many more(i.e. situational comedy, the fact that some words are just inherently funny).

  And this comes into play even in one of  the examples you gave,

  >Doctor’s appointment.
  >The doctor says “You’re gonna have to stop masturbating.” 
  >The patient says “But why!?”
  >The doctor says “So I can examine you.”

  When going over my thought process about this joke for example, i found the "unexpectedness" of the suggestion to be hardly 10-20% of what was funny, while the situation described itself is much funnier.

  In a way I could see how on a lower level part of what makes the situation funny is the "wrongdness" of it, which again in a way is "unexpected". but i think it is still missing a lot, because plenty of things which are "wrong" or "unexpected" will not be funny.
  in this example, if you replaced the action of the patient with "jump rope" it would still be somewhat funny, on the other hand if you replaced it with "solving mathematical equations" it would be significantly less funny.

  Your method is similar to some techniques used in *Comedy Writing Workbook* by Gene Perret. I highly recommend it if you're interested in practical aspects of writing jokes.

  Also Scott Adams' Six Dimensions of Humor could explain some things.
  > My observation was that you have to use at least two of the six dimensions to be recognized as humor. You can use more than two dimensions for even better results, but two is the minimum. And it does not matter which dimensions you combine. I have written extensively on this topic, so today I will just list the six dimensions and tell you that you need two of them: Naughty, Clever, Cute, Bizarre, Mean, Recognizable

  So, according to this formula, taboo jokes are easier to make because they include two dimensions before you even start writing.

  There's also defense mechanism aspect of humor that many types of comedy exploits. You laugh because alternative is being angry or terrified.
