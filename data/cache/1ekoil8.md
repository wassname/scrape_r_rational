## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  The Mother of Learning fanfic [Patriarch](https://archiveofourown.org/works/46292428/chapters/116546815) by
  TheMormegil has started updating again, so I'm posting it here once more. It's going in a different direction than MoL, but not heretically so. Focusing on developing Zorian's relationships, interpersonal, and leadership qualities. I was impressed with a lot of it, particularly some of the dialogue with Xzvim and Spear of Resolve.
  ```

  - u/deltashad:
    ```
    Seconded. While I liked the MoL, the mere month of restart let Zorian ignore too many problems for my tastes, so I really appreciate this fic tackling them head-on.
    ```

    Thanks for the rec, really enjoying so far.

    Saw this comment today in the morning and just finished reading. It's great! For all that I love MoL it was a bit... bland in writing and character voice (yes, I know, ESL, but still), and this is the opposite of that. I laughed out loud at character interactions many times, which is not a thing that I do often. The Tarantula party felt a bit like an idiot ball (not the miscommunication part, more how Z&Z handled it on-site), but otherwise the plot worked. It's fun to see Zorian still flail around somewhat after all these years when he has to make a harder SOC check ;' )

  Bavitz, author of Fargo, Cockatiel x Chameleon, Cleveland Quixotic and others, has started a new Pok√©mon fic: [When I Win the World Ends](https://archiveofourown.org/works/57689716). Also on SB and other sites. 5 chapters as of today and they're all pretty exciting. If you like WeedleTwineedle's videos, this is for you, probably.
  ```

  - u/gazemaize:

    The author let me read the entire final draft before they started posting it, and I was expecting to dislike it (I don't know anything about the franchise) but it's one of my favorite fics now.

    I highly recommend it!

    It's so good. Omg, the imagery. That scene where her father is giving a pep talk to "his" old team, where is surrounded by friends and allies of incredible power love and devotion. But he is just a stubborn man who can't let go of the fact he wasn't the best.


    How every paragraph reveals so much about so many characters, the tension, and use of established lore and characters to contextualise their actions.¬†


    It's just... why can't I write like that !?!? üò¢
    ```

  - u/thomas_m_k:
    ```
    It‚Äôs well written and very entertaining, but I‚Äôm worried that the story will ultimately make no sense if you think back on the things that actually happen in it ‚Äì you can hide a lot of non-sense behind pretty prose like this.

    But, I don‚Äôt know for sure. It might turn out great.
    ```

    - u/Dragfie:
      ```
      It's pretty nonsense already. I mean the pokemon battling is just hilarious, but it fits the self important sense of the characters so well.
      ```

    - u/Makin-:
      ```
      If it's anything like his other works, it might become abstract for a scene or two but the story overall will make perfect sense. He's not that kind of writer.

    Agreed, and I‚Äôll link the Spacebattles thread since it‚Äôs nicer to have a running discussion than Ao3 comments:¬†https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/when-i-win-the-world-ends-pok√©mon.1177233/

  I'm looking for exceedingly rare beast - a story about seeking and taking power. Not the magical or personal kind but the power over people. This requires two things. The first is passably competent protagonist with a conviction that s/he in some sense better than others and deserves to be on top. The second is author being able and willing to honestly portray the consequences - sacrifices along the way, million trade-off for each significant decision and people who would blame everything on you no matter what... 

  It's alright if the hero ends up running the adventuring party or small guild instead of grand empire - but s/he has to want it and actively manage to both grow it and maintain the control facing both internal and external challengers.

  I'm also a bit hesitant about female protagonists - nothing against them really, but they are rarely portrayed as confident and self-centered enough to pull it off.


  As there is a dearth of such stories feel free to recommend something mostly fitting or from different medium - anime, films, and so on.


  Just to be perfectly clear there are several stories which DO and DONT fit my requirements:  
  1. DO Code Geass and some of it's fanfics are canonical examples. Protagonist is competent, believes that he should rule (at least over the resistance) and both good and bad consequences abound.

  2. DONT Y≈çjo Senki and like 99% fanfics. Tanya is competent but her unwillingness to lead and assert her own moral order is the core part of her character.

  3. DONT Worm and fanfics about heroic MCs.  Being forced to take power is not the same as believing that you should take it or deserve it. The less said about MCs who outsource their decision making to bureaucracy the better.

  4. DO Couple of Worm fics "[Special Edition](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/special-edition-worm-xover.597691/reader/)" and "[Trailblaizer](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/trailblazer-worm-gundam-au-complete.680881/)". In both Taylor creates and leads her own organization with dramatic results.

  5. DONT Worm fic "[Dire Worm](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/dire-worm-worm-au-oc.300816/)". Despite promising protagonist, author is unwilling to show real consequences of seeking power - i.e. setting up you own nemesis in case you "go too far" is ridiculous.

    ```
    [Mythic Cultivation](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/61828/mythic-cultivation-my-tongtian-cant-be-this-cute) - Protagonist becomes Empress of her world.

    [Cultist of Cerebon](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/73112/cultist-of-cerebon-litrpgisekai) - Cult leader grows their organization and competes for government patronage.

    Mediterranean Hegemon of Ancient Greece - Chinese guy wakes up as a soldier in Xenophon's march of the 10,000. Ends up building an empire in Southern Italy. This is a translated novel.

    ```
    [The Traitor Baru Cormorant](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23444482-the-traitor-baru-cormorant), which I heard about from this subreddit, seems like a near perfect match for your ask (aside from the female protagonist). *Highly* recommended.
    ```

    - u/Naitra:

      Just don't read the sequels and consider it a standalone, as the author shits the bed and the entire tone/genre of the book changes 180 degrees.
      ```

  - u/NnaelKysumu:
    ```
    Have you read the manga [Kingdom](https://mangadex.org/title/077a3fed-1634-424f-be7a-9a96b7f07b78/kingdom)? It's about a peasant kid named Shin and his journey to becoming a great general during the warring states period. His best friend is also aiming to become the emperor of china. Both are pretty set on their goals, and don't shy away from what it'll take to get there. 

    Also I'm still compelled to mention *A Practical Guide to Evil* and *A Young Woman's Political Record*, even though you've probably already read the former and want nothing to do with the later. They're both very *√† propos*.
    ```

    - u/deltashad:
      ```
      I'll take a look at manga, seem promising at the first glance, thank you. I've already read Guide To Evil.

      Really like the author of "*A Young Woman's Political Record*", but extremely leery of anything Tanya-related. One too many promising Y≈çjo Senki fanfic edged me for 50 chapters before finally showing that fanfic!Tanya is incapable of making any decision without threat of consequences or moral approval of other people. If you can tell that it's not so in this fanfic, I'll gladly give it a shot.

        Minor spoiler: she gets elected to office despite herself (usual shenanigans), but once she's there she does take charge. 

        Also if your objections were based on prior bad experiences with the fandom, I'll also recommend [A Young Girl's Game of Thrones](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-young-girls-game-of-thrones.1095557/). Tanya get isekai'd again as Myrcella and has to deal with the shitstorm that's the first book of ASOIAF. The beginning might be a turn off for you; she's under Cersei's thumb for a while. However, she finds herself at the head of her own political faction pretty quickly once the dominoes start falling.
        ```

  - u/NTaya:
    ```
    I immediately thought of *Atlas Shrugged*, but a) it's badly written, so any of its takes on an interesting idea can feel underwhelming, and b) it's less about individual pursuit of power and more about a few talented and driven people getting tired of shit from the people in power and instead of *becoming* the people in power, they just dismantle the fuck up all of the economy.

    Wait! I know. Kinda. *Dune*? It doesn't start like that at first, but it eventually gets deep into seizing power and its consequences.
    ```

    - u/deltashad:
      ```
      Yes, Duna was great. If only it was a bit less esoteric in the later parts
      ```

  - u/Cosmogyre:
    ```
    Kind of fit your criteria, try them out

    *Past Life Returner* - Translated Korean webnovel, heavy focus on using future knowledge to built a financial empire and control dungeons, male MC

    *Burning Stars, Falling Skies* - RR story, primitive(neanderthal level) alien lizard? finds human spaceship, gets IQ boost, and bootstraps civilization, female alien MC
    ```

  - u/Dragfie:
    ```
    Valkyries shadow
    Orochimama
    Patriarch
    The culture meets 40k
    Skitterdoc and the other by the same author.
    I became a dungeon now what?


    These are some of my fav that seem to fit.
    If you have any more examples that aren't in the worm universe I'd be interested.
    ```

    - u/deltashad:
      ```
      Thanks, I'll take a look at them.

      Regarding my own favorites, there is  a list of little-known fics (most of them are incomplete/on-hiatus):

      1. "[Taking Sights](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4109686/1/Taking-Sights)" - Gendo from Evangelion travel back in time and decides to set things right.  With him still being paranoid bastard in charge of genocidal NERV it goes as well as you might expect
      2. "[Living an Indoctrinated Dream](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10457949/1/Living-an-Indoctrinated-Dream)" - Illusive Man from Mass Effect is thrown back in time and comes to conclusion that the main problem with Cerberus had been that he thought too small
      3. "[Thousand Shinji](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3946501/1/Thousand-Shinji)" - Shinji from Evangelion starts praying to Tzeentch. It's almost enough to make Gendo proud
      4. "[Black Luminary](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12125300/1/Black-Luminary)" - Harry Potter was adopted by Arturus Black. He was lucky enough to get inside view of the oldest wizarding family of Great Britain. Them being the darkest of them all doesnt help at all.
      5. "[The Art of the Deal](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3524043/1/The-Art-of-the-Deal)" - Naruto drops from academy and decides to just make money. He is so good at it that even neighboring hidden village grows concerned.

    "*For twenty years the Dread Empress has ruled over the lands that were once the Kingdom of Callow, but behind the scenes of this dawning golden age threats to the crown are rising. The nobles of the Wasteland, denied the power they crave, weave their plots behind pleasant smiles. In the north the Forever King eyes the ever-expanding borders of the Empire and ponders war. The greatest danger lies to the west, where the First Prince of Procer has finally claimed her throne: her people sundered, she wonders if a crusade might not be the way to secure her reign. Yet none of this matters, for in the heart of the conquered lands the most dangerous man alive sat across an orphan girl and offered her a knife.*

    *Her name is Catherine Foundling, and she has a plan.*"

    Best fantasy story ever, in my view.

      They keep updating it and, somehow, making it *worse* each time. It's like it's designed by someone who has both never read a story online, and also has never used a website other than the mobile version of facebook. It's baffling.
