## [D] [WIP] Rational Novel Writing Month - Week 3

### Post:

Checking in - who's still going?

I'm barely staying at par each day, but barely 50,000 words will still be 50,000 words.

The Story so far: Earth just suffered a major setback in that the head of the FTL project has worked himself into a coma. Meanwhile, the Deities on the outside are trying to get agents on Earth, circumventing the treaty that states they cannot interfere with a planet until it has developed FTL capabilities.

One of the Galactic Deities has bought the loyalty, or at least obedience, of a minor Earth Deity. Another, the god of untruth, Ies, has sent a pseudo-Deity to Earth; a Deity turned mortal. Which isn't supposed to be possible, because Deities are just manifestations of the collective Belief of the people who worship/follow them.

Right. So. What are other people up to?

  35,120. I am ahead of the curve, but still woefully behind on actually getting anywhere with the main plot. The actual chapters are divided into scenes of one or two thousand words each. When NaNo is over, I'll have to go through the current novel with a knife and just cut at things until I'm left with only the most interesting, forward-moving stuff. Hopefully the fact that I'm using Scrivener will make that process a lot easier.

  The work in progress - at a slight delay - [can be read here.](https://www.fictionpress.com/s/3221980/1/The-Dark-Wizard-of-Donkerk) If you're not interested in a rough cut, just wait a few months until it's properly edited.

    I'd be eagerly reading along with the rough draft updates if I didn't have so much on my plate. I look forward to seeing it in its polished state!

  I guess it's too late to start? :(

  I just have so many ideas, and so little time â€¦

    You can always start! Any writing that you get done is that much more than if you hadn't started at all.
