## Top Web Fiction Voting and Recommendations

### Post:

Hello everyone,

I just got caught up on Worth the Candle, and have also enjoyed HPMOR and Mother of Learning. I found this website where you can vote on fiction and noticed a lot of mentioned works there:

http://topwebfiction.com/?days=365

Should I just read from top to bottom? Anything on that list that should be higher up or that isn't on the list?

  Worth the Candle (natch)

  Practical Guide to Evil

  The Gods are Bastards  -- If the Trissany character is a showstopper for you early on, know that her character changes significantly/organically as the series progresses.

  Worm


  Mostly Endorsed:

  Wandering Inn

  Savage Divinity

  Passingly Endorsed:

  Metaworld Chronicles -- Largely because of frequent updates, as a kind of junk food reading.

  IMO and your mileage may vary, but most of the list is garbage. It's a popularity contest based on binary decisions, its usefulness is telling you which serials are popular right now and/or update often (hint, these two factors are related).

  If you want new stuff to read I recommend hanging out in the Monthly Recommendation threads instead of that website. 

  As for what you asked, I really like Unsong in that list, if you haven't read it yet, and The Good Student and Large Chests were pretty addictive. Worm is great too, obviously, not so much everything above it.

    Large Chests is sexist as fuck and written like garbage.
    ```

      I haven't read it in a while, but I do remember it as a trashy adventure comedy story. What made it sexist though? I wouldn't call it a feminist work or anything, but I don't think it's particularly bad on the sexism.
      ```

    - u/Makin-:
      ```
      It's for sure the worst out of the ones I named, but I did read a ton of it despite its large flaws.
      ```

      - u/Paimon:
        ```
        Someone recommended it to me, so I put in my best effort, but it was largely uncomfortable to read, and the only thing that was keeping me going was the hope that the mimic would develop empathy at some point. I eventually gave up.
        ```

        - u/Sonderjye:
          ```
          It fails on the front of character growth but at this point I almost feel that is an intrinsic part of the litrpg genre.
          ```

          - u/Paimon:
            ```
            Both "the Wandering Inn" and "There is no Epic Loot Here, Only Puns" have sympathetic characters, interesting world building *and* character growth.
            ```

            - u/MrElfhelm:
              ```
              Wandering Inn has perhaps sympathetic side characters - the two first “main chars”, to avoid spoiling anything, annoyed me to no end. The only character growth I noticed was all in stats. It got so bad I dropped whole thing shortly after conclusion of first arc.
              ```

              - u/assbutter9:
                ```
                The first arc of wandering inn is objectively the worst of the entire series. The writer consistently gets better though, and eventually cuts one of those two main characters completely out of the story for 2 full arcs. The other character becomes much more well developed and likable as the series continues. 

                I'd honestly recommend giving arc 2 a chance if you have nothing else to read atm, it's noticeably better.
                ```

                  I am currently finishing reading one light novel, so I might just give it a try - while isekaish, the world building was rather pleasant and you could definitely enjoy it to some extent, for whatever it is worth. Then again, I also happened to drop WoTC, so maybe I’m just picky. Thanks for letting me know!
                  ```

                    Nah that's completely fair, I've hated a lot of web fiction other people seem to love, a lot of it is definitely a matter of taste. I only mentioned anything because I personally also hated the first arc of Wandering Inn and only came back to it when I was stuck in a dry spell of finding anything interesting to read and am really happy I did.

              Only Puns has a comfy feeling to it and a few interesting ideas, but is hardly rational or even r-adjacent. 

              The unique atmosphere is worth at least giving it a try though.
              ```

              - u/Paimon:
                ```
                You're right about it not being rational, but then neither is large chests. This was just a lit-RPG suggestion.
                ```

    - u/signspace13:
      ```
      Yeah, the writing threw me off that one before I could reach any sexism, it just felt like it was going to be the story of the Murder happy mimic, with literally no substance, except graphic description of uncaring violence, so I noped out.
      ```

      - u/GeneralExtension:
        ```
        >the story of the Murder happy mimic,

        You have probably summed up the entire work.
        ```

  - u/PrettyDecentSort:
    ```
    > Worm is great too, obviously, not so much everything above it.

    The four entries above Worm are A Practical Guide to Evil, Ward, Metaworld Chronicles, and The Wandering Inn. Of those, one is the sequel to Worm, two more are truly excellent, and the last is fine reading if a little lightweight. Yes, the ratings are suspect and subjective, but unreadable work doesn't make it to the top of the list.
    ```

    - u/assbutter9:
      ```
      Metaworld Chronicles is worse than these other 3 in literally every way and facet of writing. I'm halfway through it now and it isn't complete awful garbage (it's reasonably fun to read if you turn your brain off) but it doesn't deserve to even be in the same sentence as the other 3.
      ```

      - u/PrettyDecentSort:
        ```
        I agree, which is why I described it as "fine" instead of "excellent". It's certainly not as good as Worm, but it's good enough that reading a chapter to see if you like it won't explode anybody's eyeballs.
        ```

        - u/assbutter9:
          ```
          Oh that's my mistake, I misread your comment and thought you were calling The Wandering Inn fine/lightweight and Metaworld excellent, but you never really specified so I apologize.
          ```

  - u/Copiz:
    ```
    Yeah I don't think it's a secret that the list isn't gonna be perfect - some authors are going to be linking the website to social medias and asking for votes at the end of the chapter, while others may not even know of the website, so votes are going to be skewed. Plus anytime you can only vote for one option radical choices will be inflated (rip US Presidential Elections)... That's why I am looking for opinions from reddit. :)

    - u/MegajouleWrites:

      You can actually vote for multiple serials.
      ```

      - u/Iconochasm:
        ```
        Up to 3, I think.
        ```

        - u/ricree:
          ```
          To the best of my knowledge, there's no limit. If you really felt like it, you could vote for all of them.
          ```

- u/CaptainSwil:
  ```
  That list is far from perfect but it's not a bad place to start.  My personal picks from there are Worm and The Gods are Bastards.  Worm is probably the most successful web serial out there and it's finished, so give it a shot.
  ```

  - u/Copiz:
    ```
    I was reading Worm several years ago before it was finished and didn't keep up with the chapter updates (I was in college at the time)...Now I'm at an awkward spot where I don't know if I should reread it all or if I should just try and read the last few arcs.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      I'd recommend the [We've Got Worm](https://www.doofmedia.com/weve-got-worm/) podcast to refresh your memory (corresponding Reddit threads [here](https://old.reddit.com/user/Kyakan/comments/a1dhfu/weve_got_wormweve_got_ward_episode_discussion/)).  
      Two authors who're very good at close reading discuss the story arc by arc, talking about what makes it so great, and *really* getting into characters' motivations and their development. 

      I guarantee they picked up a lot of stuff you missed on your first readthrough.
      ```

    - u/Draddock:
      ```
      It's worth rereading. It's one of the few books I've read more than once, and it's long AF. Seeing all the details and connections over a short period of time is worth it.
      ```

    - u/assbutter9:
      ```
      If you're actually interested in reading web fiction then just re-read Worm. There's a reason it's widely considered the best out there.
      ```

  Non rationalist recommendation

  Pedestal, a pokemon fanfic.

  It changed me, it really did. It changed what I valued in writing. Don't let the comedic writing fool you.
  ```

  - u/Addictedtobadfanfict:
    ```
    Orgin of species ruined pokemon fanfiction for me because of its phenomanol world building. It actually made sense beong a denizen in the pokemon world. Is pedestal anything like this? Do they dive into the economics and culture of tje pokemon world such as is everyone vegan?
    ```

    - u/MinisterofOwls:
      ```
      No. It's not about worldbuilding. The world is just there. It's about the characters. It really showed me what focusing on just the characters can do.
      ```

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    Hmm. That was quite epic. And emotional.

    It certainly didn't make things too easy for the protagonist, which is a plus. I would have liked more explanation of just how his team was world-class despite not having spent an unusually long time in training. But it worked well, regardless.
    ```

- u/Allian42:
  ```
  Practical guide, worth the candle and mother of learning are the main ones I'm following right now and all three are on an all time high in my opinion. My recommendation is to read at least a page, three if you can. If you can't go past that, you're probably not the target audience.
  ```

- u/signspace13:
  ```
  If you like Wuxia, Forge of Destiny, listed there, is probably the closest any will get to Rational Wuxia. It was originally Written as a quest on Sufficient Velocity, but was finished (or at least the first *volume* was) and is now being edited and posted to Royal Road, and it is *very* good, especially 8f you like Xianxia/Wuxia.
  ```

  - u/ricree:
    ```
    >probably the closest any will get to Rational Wuxia

    Is this based on the forum version? I'm caught up on the RR release, and while fun, I don't remember much rational about it.

    Offhand, Forty Millennia of Cultivation is the closest to one that I've read (aside from an early deus ex that kicks off the plot), even if it isn't perfect. *Savage Divinity* sometimes nudges in that direction, but never to the point where I could call it rational fiction.
    ```

    - u/signspace13:
      ```
      Perhaps Rationalist is a better description, and it *is* the forum version, just edited to not include the Quest bit. The reason I call it rational is mainly due to the characters and their development, and the world and its development, everything makes sense in context with the rest, and the characters each have goals of their own that they are in pursuit of. Last I checked that is the Definition of Rational.
      ```

  - u/GlueBoy:
    ```
    Speaking of rational Xianxia, I recently read [A Thousand Li by Tao Wong](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44327636-the-first-step) and was pleasantly surprised since I hated all his other books. A pretty good take on the genre, with the application of western storytelling conventions and a decent, relatable protagonist.
    ```

- u/AssadTheImpaler:
  ```
  Strongly recommend The Zombie Knight
  ```

  - u/GlueBoy:
    ```
    It's good, but has been dead for 6 months.
    ```

- u/MilesSand:
  ```
  I read 9 of the current top 10. If you use the site for recommendations it just eventually ends up like that.

  All the stories on there are pretty similar (superhero/superhuman) because the system is set up to keep the strongest clique engaged and everyone else with something better to do.

  My recommendation is to try the top 2. If you like them, you're pretty likely to like the others as well, if you don't, you probably won't.
  ```
