    Well...idk if this is true from a *storytelling* perspective. Ender's game depicted a "simple" exploit ("the enemy's gate is down"). In real life the arbitrariness of "down" would have probably occurred to most people in about 30 seconds of being in zero gravity. Yet the first time I was reading this (granted, I was younger) it didn't break my suspension of disbelief that a group of people who regularly practiced combat sports in space were all too uncreative to realize this. The fact that most people don't just hang out in zero gravity was pretty sufficient for young-me to buy the idea that most people would try to maintain an arbitrary "the floor is down and the ceiling is up" reference frame

  >farm boy to hero epics. which in my opinion just can't be rational

  Why not? Can't farm boys be rational, if they learn how? 

  A great deal of rational fiction seems to deal with the concept of 'a particularly intelligent and rational person gains access to some source of special power that allows them to break the normal rules. How do they exploit this in surprising ways?' or 'rational character faces some unique and surprising challenge and applies rationality to solve it'.

      > What makes our farm boy so special?Why was he chosen and not the farmer next door?

      This one at least, I can answer. Suppose a writer creates a setting where *A* farm boy, it doesn't matter which one, gets magical whatever-it-is that enables him to become a hero and save the world. The writer will obviously make the story about that farm boy. This is called the [Anthropic Principle](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropicPrinciple).

      Example: How come Taylor got the power to control bugs, and not something less versatile and exploitable? How come Zorian happened to be the one to get included in the time loop, and not someone else? Why did Catherine Foundling get saved by the Black Knight and become his Squire, instead of some other headstrong young woman with a similar outlook on villains and heroes? None of these people were particularly special or unique before the events of the story. Personal details aside, you could surely find someone just like them within a few miles of where they live (or the school he goes to, in Zorian's case). So why are these ordinary people going through such unusual and fantastical events, and becoming such *extra*ordinary people?

      Simple: because if these things had happened to someone else, the story would be about that other person. instead.

      I like to think of it like this: A story (even a rational story) can withstand a certain amount of unjustified, unlikely events. If you have too many, the story falls apart because the main thing moving things along is luck and random chance, not the characters and their motivations. But if yours has none, and your setting is being properly exploited by other people who *do* have something unlikely giving them more power and influence than the average person... then why isn't the story about one of them?

      If we consider the "classic" farm boy to hero journey to be one in which the issues you mentioned aren't addressed, then it's kind of a meaningless stance, isn't it? "A story that isn't written to be rational can't be rational." Of course it can't, by definition.

      > how did people verify that prophesies are legit form of divination and not the ravings of lunatics?

      >What makes our farm boy so special?Why was he chosen and not the farmer next door?

      That sounds like an important thing for our rational farm boy to do, assuming that there's indeed a prophecy. And maybe the answer won't be what he expected: maybe the prophecy was made up by the villain to root out rebellious sorts. Maybe it was made up by a rebel leader whose noticed the farm boy's talents and wanted to force him into the spotlight. Maybe the rational farm boy makes up the prophecy himself. Most real-world prophecies aren't the ravings of lunatics; they're clever manipulations cooked up by conmen or political leaders. 

      And that's all assuming there's a prophecy. Luke Skywalker didn't have one, he just had a special bloodline and bought the wrong pair of droids. Maybe our rational farmboy finds a magic sword abandoned in his field from an old war, or an alien spacecraft crashed into his blackberry patch.

      Not everyone is required to act rationally in rational fiction, they just have to have justifications for their actions. People believe in prophecies all the time today. 

      And maybe just being rational is enough for a call to arms. Maybe our farm boy perceives a weakness in the evil overlords plan and works for years to come up with a plan.

      >Without years of training, and studying, making connections etc..

      If you think that's what's required, why not include it? It's not hard to skip ahead and explain what the protagonist has been doing to further their cause.

      >Realistically, what can one person do?

      Ask Nelson Mandela, Ghandi, or other major revolutionary figures. Of course they need backing if their enemy controls the government, but most such stories already include a Rebel Alliance of some sort.

      >Batman could kill Putin and take over Russia

      If your bad guy is uniquely bad, like a powerful necromancer or something, maybe it's enough to kill him and his inner circle. Maybe there's a specific leader in the line of succession who the farm boy judges would be preferable. Maybe the charismatic leader has gone insane, like many thought Hitler had when he continued pushing the war effort after it was clear Germany was losing.

      It sounds to me like you've identified some key elements of a good rational farmboy to hero story.

      Except that it has happened at least once in the real world. Jeanne D'arc, played it pretty straight (prophecy, farm girl -> national hero, lead armies against the English, etc.). 

      It wouldn't be that hard to write an alternate ending that leads to a French victory for her story.

      In general prophecy is easiest if you just assume the prophet is a charlatan.

      A fortune teller who makes falsifiable claims gets outed as a fraud pretty quickly, and it's best for business if their customers leave liking what they heard. So the prophecies most likely to be told are going to be vague and generally positive. Then all it takes is a fortune teller stringing together some generic signs and potents nonsense and a farm girl with enough ambition to think "hey, I'm a maid from Orleans", and a general populace who wants God to favor their war, and there you go. That also neatly explains "why this farm girl". She's the one who heard that prohecy and thought "they're talking about me" rather than "I hope that otehr girl shows up soon." This can be made explicit in your story (The lego Movie is a decent example of that) or not as what really matters is how the characters react to it.

      As for the issues of "what can one person really do?" well, that's actually pretty easy. Pick any random historical figure of note. That one person did all that. Remember credit travels up-hill (and blame down-hill). A rational heroine doesn't have to do everything herself. But being there holding the flag while others do probably gets her the credit, and if it's her idea/plan or her who convinced the people in question to try it the credit isn't entirely underserved. Throw in a couple hands-on accomplishments that she could realistically achieve to keep it honest and you're good.

      Another pretty trivial one is "how do they do all that without years of training/etc." well they could juts receive  years of training, have introductions made by somone who'd using them, and otherwise be groomed for the position ones they gain some momentum from the prophecy thing. (Codex Alera takes that rout with 'Tavi.)

      The hard part is dealing with the final duel between the heroine and the Big bad.  However I'd argue that a literal direct duel followed by immediate dispersal of the evil army isn't required for the 0 to hero story arc. All the heroine really has to do is get rid of the evil army (save conquering/reforming the empire for the sequel). In a rational story that might look more like arranging a strategic victory by some combination of assassination, leveraging the evil empire's political disunity back home, and a well timed tactical victory to cause the Empire to loose the will to continue it's conquest in the heroine's back yard.

      >how do you turn him into someone who can take on a dark lord so fast in a believable way? 

      Well, in real life, dark lords remain undefeated simply because most people don't care enough to try to defeat them. The lesson of heroic stories is that even you, simple farm boy, can make a difference if you actually try to do so.

      I think Batman could, in fact, do the first thing, if not the second. Unfortunately, the other truth about real life is that assassinating the big bad guy doesn't usually actually help matters, but still.

  Imagine an author. He wants to write a story. This story has a villain, some evil or morally-grey figure who is doing some form of Objectionable Things which must be stopped. (Perhaps he simply disagrees with the protagonist on some point of philosophy. Regardless, he is Opposed). This Villain need not be a single person; it may be an entire organisation.

  Then, the Villain must be stopped. Or, at least, an attempt must be made to stop the Villain. This is generally done by the Protagonist, who we will for the sake of simplicity refer to as the Hero. (Perhaps he will succeed. Perhaps he will not.) But the Hero, like the Villain, need not be a single person.

  Let us consider the options here. Either the Hero is a single person, or he is not (and the Villain is bought down by a significant cooperative effort without a clear leader).

  If the Hero is a single person, then he must face the Villain in person - and probably multiple times, to allow him to occasionally lose and thus increase the narrative tension. Moreover, there must be some element of 'last chance' in the final confrontation - there must be *no* further chances to defeat the Villain. Generally, this implies that the Hero *must* be exceptional in some manner - such that no-one else can confront the Villain in the way that the Hero can. And this leads to a unique/gifted Hero, and is why these stories are so common.

  --------------

  What of the option, then, the Hero that consists of multiple people with no clear leader? Such a story can be written, yes, and can be written well.

  Let us say, for the sake of argument, that each chapter deals with a new Hero, doing his part to defeat the Villain. Then each chapter needs to establish a new character, establish his or her support network, friends, and resources, and then run on until his or her confrontation with the Villain. It *can* be done, but - well, you end up spending a *lot* of time on character establishment, and most of it for characters that you won't see outside of the given chapter (you can save time with *some* overlap, but there are limits).

  --------------

  In short, I don't think that small "contained" stories lend themselves more to rationality. I do think that small "contained" stories, regardless of genre, are easier to write.

    Why must the protagonist be the only one capable of dealing with the villain?

    I'm a big fan of seeing stories from the perspective of "this isn't the story of a super-special person, this is a historical retelling of the one guy that did end up doing the thing, and we only retell it about him because he did it".

    It's not that noone else couldn't theoretically have done it, it's that he's the one that ended up succeeding, potentially doing more good than if the villain had fallen to some other circumstance later, or been allowed to rule until his heir took over.
    ```

      > Why must the protagonist be the only one capable of dealing with the villain?

      Narrative tension.

      Now, I don't mean that the Hero necessarily needs to be the only one able to deal with the Villain *at all* - merely that the Hero must be the only one able to stop the Villain *at the time of the final confrontation*. This might be simply because the Hero is the only person in the right place at the right time (example: an ordinary accountant who has to try to land a plane after everyone else (including the pilot) ate the chicken and he's the only one in the cockpit in any state to fly anything) and anyone else could theoretically have done it *had they been there*.

      But you lose a lot of narrative tension if the hero's loss just means that the next prospective hero in the queue walks in.

        Ah, that's fair enough. I mostly have an issue with the stories where the basic core of the story is "there's a super-special person and nobody else in the entire universe can change anything except this one guy."

        Though evidently it does not have to be the final confrontation, there might be many other occasions to stop the villain for good, but at all the other occasions a lot more people die, like how the Avatar is forced to stop the Firelord on the day when he's strongest.

        Even if he failed and fled that day, he could probably have beaten him another day, but by then a few million people would be dead and their cities turned to rubble.

          Yeah, and I can see where you're coming from. I think the prevalence of that sort of story is largely because it's a whole lot easier to write, rather than for any deeper reason. You only need to consider a world, and the changes wrought upon that world by *one* person (two if you allow the Villain to make his own changes). You don't need to consider the consequences of ten thousand different people each trying to make their mark on the world...

          > Though evidently it does not have to be the final confrontation, there might be many other occasions to stop the villain for good, but at all the other occasions a lot more people die,

          That works too. Then there are stakes - if the Hero fails in this confrontation, a dozen cities die before the next Hero can step up. That maintains narrative tension; especially if one or more characters whom the reader has met are in these cities at the time.

            It's easier, but it's so much more fascinating and engaging when the world feels real, and that it's full of the possibility for change. Now that I think about it, it's one of the things I enjoy most about many stories like Starcraft or Worm.

            It's not a story about the special guy, it's the story about how shit went down, and even a small change could make it go anywhere else.

              You're right - but that can also be done in farm-boy-to-hero epics. Consider, since you've just bought it up, Worm. That is a Ordinary Schoolgirl to Hero epic, in which one character gains a sudden superpower and must save the world from an endless and escalating series of supervillains, many of whom only she can defeat...

              On the one hand, that description is everything you just said you don't want. On the other hand - Taylor isn't the *only* character going ordinary-person-to-superhero. More than half the cast is on the exact same journey, and the world reflects that; moreover, Taylor earns her victories. They are not merely given to her. Taylor doesn't win because she's super special. Taylor wins because she works *hard* to make those victories happen.

              - u/Hust91:

                Precisely, it's very enjoyable. Though I'd argue that she's not the only one who can defeat many of those supervillains, she's just the one that ends up doing it.

                She's not the only one that could potentially have beaten the final challenge (unsure if you've finished it and don't want to spoil), but she's the one that does, and innumerable stories have been written about other heroes or villains that could potentially have done it, through powers or simply through figuring out what makes the final challenge tick and advising others.

                There's one awesome and relatively short Supreme Commander crossover that's actually able to take on the final challenge head-to-head through self-replicating armies with overwhelming firepower.

                Thinking about it, it's not necessarily "there's only one person who can do it" that I mind, it's when the reason only they can do it is because it's "fated" or when the reason seems contrived, like "only they are brave enough" or "only they are clever enough" when they never really display qualities particularly above the normal for people in the setting.

                  So, in short, you want your heroes to *earn* their victories, and not be given them on a silver platter? You want them to actually display some form of heroism, and not just He Is The Hero Therefore He Wins The End?

                  In that case, yeah, I pretty much agree with you. And I know I'm not the only one - the Boring Invincible Hero trope on TvTropes is called *Boring* for remarkably good reason.

                    Either earn it, or just make it feasible that they possess a quality or combination of qualities that lets them do a thing that noone else has managed to do before.

                    Halo for example, kind of half-assed it by saying that what 117 had most of that noone else did was "luck", while Half-Life has the more believable example that Gordon Freeman is a regular guy, but placed at precisely the right time and place where some powerful organization who can see the future foresaw him reaping an unstoppable path of death through the Evil Empire's lines.

                    He himself is not special, he's just at the precisely right time and place with precisely the mind, skills, causal butterflies etc as determined by a clairvoyant, and that seemed feasible enough to not bother me, since it's clear that the primary reason other people haven't already done what he's doing is that the Evil Empire of Half Life is simply obscenely powerful and normal people have a hilarious mortality rate when fighting them.

  > Wouldn't it be infinity more interesting to read about an average mage trying to get by in a society where everyone can become a mage?

  If the "average" part is how much the universe pimped the character (call it Chosen-One Factor), then yes definitely. I always enjoy characters that get ahead by their brains more than those about people born with some unique power-up. 

  And I would definitely enjoy a low-key story where the things at stake are things that are important to the character, not the nation/world/universe. I'm not sure it gets *more rational* just because the initial conditions and scope is different though, that's probably up to the author no matter what. 

  I also prefer when "anyone can become a mage" means that in the same way as "anyone can become a PhD" - you need money and/or connections to be able to do expensive studies for many years instead of working, and you need the drive and grit (and a bit of brain) to master difficult subjects.

  The Inheritance Cycle (Eragon and co.)  has shades of this, particularly in the magic system. It's really not all there in Eragon itself, but that was the first book written by a high-schooler. From that perspective, it's fairly cogent.

  Starting with the second book, however, the rules of the magic system and the ways society was built around are fully realized and make sense. Dragons and races who have tied themselves to dragons are the most magical, though dragon magic is far more esoteric and wild than any used by humanoids. The elves used a ritual to tie themselves to the dragons thousands of years ago, so nearly all of them have the capacity to use magic. Magic has four simple rules: don't fuck with time, don't try necromancy, magic costs the same as doing a task personally, and don't use up all of the energy your body has available.The punishment for any of these mistakes is death. There are clear rules of energy usage and transfer, though right now only biochemical energy can be used as a fuel source. You can expend your own stored energy, drain it from surrounding plants, animals, and people (at the cost of feeling the moment of their death personally), and store excess energy in crystals, but nobody has figured out how to extract energy from light yet. It has a ton more rules and background, but none of those rules are ever broken in the series, as far as I can tell. All the obvious low-hanging fruit has been picked by the elves already, from spells which instantly kill people at almost zero energy expenditure (14 of them), to a dizzying bevy of healing spells which Eragon doesn't have the time to study due to the civil war raging o'er the land, to...really anything you can imagine. The elves use magic for practically everything, and they almost never accidentally kill themselves with it. The whole system is used really well, and it's tied into the otherwise steel-age tech base quite skillfully.

      Dunno if this is coincidence or just subtle really good writing, but the reason why it took the black death for the renaissance to happen is because the black death basically killed half the population of Europe, including many of the various guild's customers:

      Guilds, from the 1100s to the 1400s, basically burned stuff and killed anyone that tried to sell more than their quota - the "higher profit per sale, lower profit from fewer sales overall" method. The black death killed enough customers and guild members alike that modern capitalism was able to take root in Europe. Women were forced/paid highly to work in jobs (*gasp!*) as compared to at home and in the fields in order to literally keep gov'ts and businesses from collapsing. The black death also was a crucial moment for humanity in general, as that basically forced politicians/kings/businesses to care about the *health* of their citizens (as compared basically breeding them for hundreds of years like cattle), as well as introduced the beginnings of germ theory, along with the baby steps on the importance of sanitation.

      My guess is that in the Eragon series, the bad guy (forget his name) was basically trying to oppress his people, like many modern day dictators. 

      If people are able to profit and the gov't can't control the people into following the gov'ts completely arbitrary and morally wrong rules, that profit leads to investment and development, and eventually revolt. Change the gov'ts rules to be more sensible (like allowing development and investment), and boom, no revolts.

      For the lace thing it's actually fairly well done, in the empire mages of all kinds have two choices, serve the king or die, so no magical mass production there, the elves simply don't value (mundane) things (easily) made with magic since almost any of them can do it (lace isn't part of their culture but if it was then making it magically would result in it being common and low value, simple economics would see to that even before you get to their cultural views on magic), then there's the rebels who do do it.  
      Perhaps the rebels were slow to try, but they didn't have many mages and funding wasn't a big enough concern to use the few they did have until they went on the march.

  Reading about someone who is the first -insert something- ever is hugely popular, and there's no reason they can't be rational. Because most of them have no fantastic elements at all.

      The last-linked story in my previous comment (*Look to the West*) is *literally* presented as a series of long excerpts from history books gathered from an alternate timeline. I find it *far* more interesting than fiction that, rather than [having an interesting protagonist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_d%27Artagnan_Romances), merely focuses on [a boring everyman who is observing the setting](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/216363).

      I hope you don't seriously think that a biography of your life would be more interesting than a general history of your country (or your culture) between the year of your birth and the year of your death.

        For some people, yes: mundane biographies are actually a popular form.

        I suspect you may be overgeneralizing your own personal preferences.

  > Wouldn't it be infinity more interesting to read about an average mage trying to get by in a society where everyone can become a mage? A protagonist that works hard within an established magic system and makes use of the rules and limitations in clever ways is way more interesting than someone who is just very unique/gifted and constantly acts outside of what considered normal to get out of difficult situations.

  I personally agree ... but it's a lot more difficult to write, since your exploits should (in theory) not be low-hanging fruit, meaning that they should credibly be insights that only occur after intensive study by a keen intellect. It's understandable that this is more difficult, because you have to simulate, in your head, several layers of thinking and meta thinking by large groups of people.

  I worked as a software engineer for roughly seven years, and describing my daily work *and all the systems, base knowledge, etc.* would be a real challenge, even before getting around to the fact that all that would have to be invented from scratch as part of the worldbuilding.

  That's essentially what A Practical Guide to Evil is about, although it's genre-aware characters do play off traditionally irrational tropes somewhat
