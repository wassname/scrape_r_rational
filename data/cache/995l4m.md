  Don't let the homophobes get to you OP. The story is great. My personal gripe is that a disproportionally large number of characters in rational stories are poly, but overall it's a minor thing. Dudes kissed. That's okay. Keep writing.

      I can't think of names off the top of my head, but I know that I've read a few with more harem-style romances in recent memory. Though they usually skirt the edges of what I'd consider "rational"; rational until it has to do with other people, usually. 

      That said, if anyone can find fics with poly main characters, I'd love to read them.  Part of why these three are poly in the first place is in response to the lack of that, but maube I was just looking in the wrong place.

          I really like Leftover Soup!  And the relationship shown in it, while certainly made narratively interesting, isn't actually that idealized.  The characters have personal problems, in addition to cute moments, which they mostly resolve through communication.  That's... pretty much every successful poly relationship ever.

          Hell, that's ever successful *relationship* ever, full stop.

        The two examples I'd give is "Well this hasn't gone well" over in r/HFY and Savage Divinity (which skirts being rational).

        Though thinking back on it now, both of these are more harem-esque than an accurate representation of poly-amorous relationships, so I rescind my complaint; as long as it doesn't deteriorate into a harem fantasy.

          This has not gone well is a really interesting example, because it's sort of a fake-out harem?  Like, almost literally every character that isn't the protagonist is female.  I think Arno is the only male character who gets repeat screen time through more than a few chapters. And almost all of those women are described through a very masculine lens; they're attractive, sexualized, and frequently sleep with the protagonist 

          But the main character is monogamous.  And generally pretty chill about it, too.  It's not his fault as a character that the author didn't want to write more than one guy.

  How did alanna get a papercut? I kind of remember that her skin had been upgraded with increased toughness a few chapters ago. Or was that another character?

  ```
  Just have Alanna kiss Sarah after they rescue her. That should counter out two guys kissing.
  ```
