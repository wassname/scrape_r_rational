  Description copied from the RoyalRoad fiction page:


  “A rebellion in the Pantheon of his father thrusted a young deity in a world he doesn't fully understand Despite never having visited the mortal lands before and finding those powerless creatures really strange he must try to develop and protect a civilization and a cult of his own or he will die forgotten with no chance of ever enacting his revenge on the rebels.”


  Please include a description in the future when posting fictions, if you could?

  Thanks!
