## [HF][RT] The Monster Baru Cormorant

### Post:

This is the sequel to the [previously discussed](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3jj4br/how_baru_cormorant_would_overthrow_emperor/) The Traitor Baru Cormorant.

To get a sense for the author's style, check out Seth Dickinson's post here: https://www.tor.com/2015/08/27/how-baru-cormorant-would-overthrow-emperor-palpatine-kill-voldemort-and-stop-sauron/.

I just finished reading this today, and I think based on past discussions there are likely others here interested who either will or have already read it.

Brief introduction with very mild premise-level spoilers: 

Baru Cormorant is a young girl from a small island that gets economically and culturally invaded by the Empire of Masks, which is a clever, power-hungry, expansionist political entity. She has a mother and two fathers (on her island the families are often large) but to the Masquerade, with its own self-serving philosophy about "social hygiene", such practices of same-sex or poly relationships (and many other practices) are anathema. The Masquerade also has a brewing scientific culture, with new advances in chemistry leading to better sanitation, longer life times, but also crueler implements of war and control. Baru decides to fight back in a subversive way -- to gain power from within the Masquerade, a meritocratic republic, so that she can help her family and her island.

Baru's story will see her using economics and general reasoning to develop offensive and defensive strategies, in a bid to gain power and achieve her goals.

In Monster, Baru continues this but from a position of power, and her story continues to highlight complex, realistic characters who act in reasonable ways based on information available to them. And it also builds an interesting fictional culture of the Oriati Mbo -- interesting in how uniquely characterized it is. It's a culture a thousand years old, something the Masquerade has so far "failed to digest" in their ultimate quest for causal closure over the known world.

It's great fun.

  I'm waiting until my exams are done to read the sequel but i just wanted to throw in a recommendation for the first novel. It's political and economic scheming within scheming competence porn where you're always guessing what level characters are playing at. And most inpressive to me is the story does that with *so much feeling*. Without getting specific i'll just say: the stories gonna make you feel some things.

  I am studiously avoiding reading anything in this thread as I have yet to finish monster but I read traitor because of this thread and it was great so thanks for the recommendation.

  I was worried during the last few chapters that it wouldn't end how I thought it would but I guess the clue is in the title
