  Apologies for not posting this earlier. There were some problems with the post been in transit for a couple of days and it's been kind of crazy (both of my flights were delayed, I stayed at the airport overnight, the bus thought my reservation had  been canceled, and TSA broke my luggage while inspecting it). 

  Chapters 32-36 are another experiment in story structure. I guess you could say it's a kind of chiasmus. I don't know if it's going to work, but from the beginning HSTW has been about doing things that I wasn't sure about. 

  By the way, I now have a Patreon account. Besides writing fiction, I'm also writing a series of nonfiction books like [Strange Nations](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/825176040/strange-nations?ref=user_menu) (which will be available as soon as DriveThruRPG approves it, because it's my first publication through them). Check out the Patreon page for more details, but the gist is that this will help to cover some of my operating costs and, potentially, let me expand what I'm doing to cover additional projects (if this *really* takes off then I could even do a third chapter HSTW every week). 

  If you've been looking at the [About](https://heroessavetheworld.wordpress.com/) page on HSTW recently, you might have noticed that I added a note about licensing. Heroes Save the World is like a lot of my other work: It has a Creative Commons license that lets you adapt, remix, and share it as you please, so long as you extend the same privilege to other people. My commitment to the Creative Commons closes off the traditional routes for making an income off of my writing, though, so if I'll have to rely on your direct support if I want to expand beyond what I'm currently doing. 

  If any of this sounds interesting, then please check out my [Patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/WMBsaltworks), where I also talk about reward tiers and current goals.

  I liked this chapter! But it left me with the nagging question of what her power might be D:

    Ah, nevermind! I thought this would be a one-off but just read the following chapter.
    I'm liking this pacing.
