  While some parts of this article are political and spiders (particularly concerning the merits / lack thereof of George Lucas' views on democracy), I thought there were some interesting offhand points about how "wise" characters are written and how ineffectual forces of civilization have become an overused trope in scifi and fiction in general.

    He does have some good points. But his main criticism goes like this:

    1. Democracy is good. 
    2. The movies are skeptical about democracy [I would say they are skeptical about the ability of large democracies to scale up as well as confront unexpected challenges.] 
    3. Therefore George Lucas is evil. 

    The same sort of argument leads him to blast someone in the comment section for citing Plato, which is apparently a no-no since Plato is  "...the most malignant and relentlessly wrongheaded philosopher, ever, who despised democracy and provided intellectual ammo to be used against it for 2500 years."

    Geeeeeez. I think the opposite is true: frank discussion of the strengths and weakness of democracies (and how these may be ameliorated or worsened by various constitutional systems) is a good thing -- as well as a necessary condition of democracies continuing to evolve and thrive in the future.

      The whole comments section is tribal warmongering. That Zarathustra guy is the only one trying to argue in good faith.

        I just skimmed through it all...wow! That David Brin guy is something else.

      It was a strange experience reading this. On the one hand, he has a few interesting points, on the other hand he's clearly going further than he should in attributing many of these things to malice. Can't tell if he doesn't notice his own bias or if he's trolling for clickbait.

      I always find it strange when people claim that democracy == good. It happens to be the system used in most of the least-bad governments in history, but I'm not sure that's the same as "good."

    The comments section however is just Brin consistently being terrible at argument. 

    It's actually kind of sad. I feel like we could play a game of 'count the fallacies'.

      But his books are good, right?  Haven't read them and planned to; this makes me inclined to drop those plans.

        His books are reasonably good.  

        (Well, *Sundiver* is ehn, and his Foundation sequel is not worth reading the other two books in the trilogy and fairly heavy in Brin-ist morality preaching, and *Heaven's Reach* struck me as a bit phoned-in.  But despite my general desire to grab Brin-the-pundit by the lapels and try to shake sense into him, I **do** have all his novels and a collection of his short fiction.)
        ```

  Oh, Brin again.  And again with the claim that Obi-Wan offers to teach the Force to Han. 

  (Go, re-watch the old VHS, or pirated laserdisc rips/the Laserdic rip to DVD that was in the Ultimate Collection . . . even, if you like, check against the Special Edition New Hope DVD, the published "script", and the novelization.  **None of them** have this supposed offer to teach Han.  As I learned when I was younger and more impressed with Dr. Brin, and repeated his claim, and was challenged, and actually went to check for myself.)

  Occasionally I hope the various bits of nonsense I catch Brin saying (like when he claimed the solution in HPMOR was un-foreshadowed, and never mind the very first lines of the story) are deliberately there to encourage people to distrust claims of authority.  But whatever his private intent, his public claims are regularly *full of shit*.

  >I do hope folks will notice, for example, that Yoda, in Attack of the Clones, orders the Jedi into a suicide charge that kills most of them, then conveniently shows up with the new clone army that he ordered. An act of treachery and betrayal so stunning that I had to watch the movie twice. Perhaps that was Lucas’ evil plan. 

  ಠ_ಠ wat

  Oh, right, he watched the film stoned.

  >Yoda is pretty much, inarguably, the most evil figure ever in the history of any human mythology. I have defied folks to name one time when he says or does anything that is indisputably wise.

  Dude's a Force expert. He tells you things about the Force. Also, he's a precog. If you ignore all that, I'm not sure what kind of "wisdom" he's supposed to give beyond it.

  >Abrams and Disney appear to have backed off from George Lucas’ heavy-handed propaganda.

  Yeah, we've got Nazis who brainwash people instead. *eyeroll*

  >Absolutely. The apotheosis of Darth Vader was truly disgusting. Saving one demigod—a good demigod, his son—wiped away all his guilt from slaughtering billions of normal people. 

  ...

  Truly, the idea that people could be redeemed is an affront to good-hearted folk everywhere.
