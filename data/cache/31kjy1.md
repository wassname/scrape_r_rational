    >As far as Perfect State goes, do you really think it's a dystopia or that anyone is "trapped"?

    He doesn't seem to have access to *reality*.  Let's say he wants to find out how things *really* work: he can't do it!  He never has access to a level of reality to whose causal interactions all other levels reduce.

      That's what I was trying to get at when I commented that we don't really know what the Wode will allow. From the description, I agree it's unlikely he'll ever get to reality, but is there any reason they wouldn't allow him a world indistinguishable from reality (i.e. causally consistent and based on the real world so that he can "find out how things really work")? 

      Again, for all we know there's been some apocalyptic event making simulated life preferable or other reasons that make their system sensible- I say this because like I said before, their system doesn't make much sense, but since it's also not very fleshed out and there's a lot of room to allow a utopia, I don't think it's safe to jump to a dystopian scenario.

  _ExistenZ_ doesn't really fit in here, the reason things are messy is that you're looking at the output of a mass-mind where two players are trying to hide their own issues by shunting all of their distress at the setting-creator and conflict modules.   If the two main characters didn't have an irrational fear of simulationist entertainment, the story wouldn't exist.

  Log Horizon isn't about being trapped by an evil overlord. It's about homesteading and society building.

  The battles aren't even the most interesting parts.

    In a Platonic sense, the question is always undecidable: I can't know that I'm not in the Matrix right now, or that I'm not going to hit age 50 and be told the rest of you are AIs and I'm in a Science State or something.

    *But*, we observe that the reality around us is causally consistent and runs on rules, rules which allow us to plan our lives and engage the world according to our own desires.

    The nasty thing about simulations is that they appear causally consistent... until suddenly they're not, and it turns out that your reality can be altered according to the whims of some *agent*, who is suddenly directly interfering in your ability to live life as *you* want to rather than as *they* want you to -- and who is often interfering with agents other than you.

  Alternatively, if the inside of the simulation is actually unpleasant and has to be (for the overlord's goals or for practical reasons), generate an even worse "Outside" simulation, one that is terrible without anyone making it worse, where it is difficult to survive and no luxuries are available.

  Is the bright spot in your month getting an apple along with your gruel? Then in the Outside simulation, you don't get any apples. In the simulation, do you have hard labor every day? Then in the Outside, you have to scrabble day and night to get enough food to survive, and it's even less tasty than your standard gruel. And the best part is, this is *easy* to simulate.

  Add in a way to return to the inside simulation, and people who return will warn people they should stay inside where living is easier and conditions are more pleasant.

  Interestingly, I *just* had this conversation online, literally five minutes ago. The person in question was asserting that a positive Matrix was more likely than a negative one. My answer to that was:

  -----

  I would say it's much MORE likely for an evil/negative version to happen. Of all the worlds where Matrix pods come about, more of those worlds are negative than positive. In order for a Matrix system to be positive it needs to be built by people with good intentions, who keep the hardware and software from being backdoored while it's being built, it needs to remain in the hands of the creator (or other good people), and no externalities can come up that would interfere. Mess up any one of those ingredients and you have hell. Also, there's no way for anyone on the outside to tell conclusively what's going on inside, so there's no way for an outside body to provide oversight. If you doubt this, google for "Thompson Unix hack" and click the top result. Short version: Ken Thompson was one of the guys who invented Unix, the operating system that basically the entire Internet runs on. For a few years there he owned the entire Net because, when he sent out the tapes, he put a self-replicating Trojan into the login program and the compiler that you would use to create a new login program. There was no plausible way to detect it or get rid of it, and the same would apply to a Matrix pod. 

  -----

  I guess the real questions are 

  1. Do people know it's a simulation and why/how? (Might be "because they went in voluntarily", which is fair.)
  1. Is there actually a way to get out from the inside? It doesn't seem plausible on the face of it. 
  1. Why is the Matrix Lord evil? What's his motivation / what does he gain?
