  I don't know how the Guide managed to climb up to 4th -oh shit no- [3rd](http://topwebfiction.com/) on top web fiction so quickly, but I'm loving it. Keep up the good work people. The guide definitely deserves it (though I should admit that I haven't read all of the fiction on top ten - only like four).

  You'd think I'd be getting tired of the "Haha, these heroes have no chance, we will win soon!" quotes by Dread Emperor Something Something, the He-Died-Immediately-After-He-Said-That, but I'm not. All these quotes are so fun.

  Also, I'm not sure what the nature of the ambush they set at the end? They're going to burn the 15th somehow?

    ```
    They drew them past the walls, into scattered street fighting where massed formations are impossible and everything is too spread out for the Woe to find a fulcrum point, then let loose the super soldiers.
    ```

  ```
  I don't believe that there'll be a more appropriate time for [this](https://youtu.be/PdhmODA8M64). In fact, I see Catherine fighting on frozen ground right after dealing with Summer.

  ```
  Catherine please don't abandon Killian, she's cute and magical.
  ```

  - u/um_m:
    ```
    I agree, but you can't deny that any romance between Cat and Archer is going to be amusing AF.
    ```

    - u/DCarrier:
      ```
      But that's clearly blackrom. Killian can be her matesprit and Archer can be her kismesis. Who should fill the other two quadrants?
      ```

        ```
        I have no idea what those are but to quote Magnus the Red "This is the kind of knowledge that should remain a secret"
        ```

  - u/panchoadrenalina:
    ```
    white true, archer is Cat's equal, mote than anything Killian will ever be unless she gains a Name somehow. 

    that may be better for Cat
    ```

      ```
      IMO i smell a new Apprentice in the works...
