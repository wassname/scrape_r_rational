## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  So what are the dead fics that you still reread or check if they've updated? Let's say at least five years since the last update. Rational fics would be nice but it's not necessary.

    To name a few of the good ones:

    * [Seed](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/seed-a-worm-au.340626/) - Another good one, one of my favorite wormfics

    * [fate/first order derivative](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/fate-first-order-derivative-fsn.47581/page-6#post-11451071) - This one is written strangely, almost breaks the fourth wall at points, not even sure what it is trying to achieve with that but the worldbuilding and writing outside of that quirk is incredible enough to land my third favorite work on this list.

    * [Infigeas Online](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/18304/infigeas-online) - Second favorite on this list, might not even be dead, the author said he would come back. Do not be driven away by the litrpg tag, this is way better than any story in that genre that I've found.

    * [Monstrous](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/20472/monstrous) - My favorite on the whole list, I think it really would have gone somewhere if it kept updating.

    * [A SH AI EL](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/18724/a-sh-ai-el) - This one was really good while it lasted, and it actually lasted a relatively long time.

    * [A Broken World](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/16075/a-broken-world-dropped-pending-rewrite) and its dropped [Rewrite](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/24374/a-broken-world-rewrite) - In the first one the protagonist went crazy and the second one has almost no chapters before it was dropped.

    * [Jadepunk](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/18633/jadepunk) - Really good writing, but not that many chapters.

    * [The Sea of Knowledge](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/znt-the-sea-of-knowledge.236443/) - Really only good for me because I expected an industrial revolution, it was dropped before this even came close.

  I'd like to recommend Joe Abercrombie, a relatively popular mainstream fantasy author. He's just come out with a new book in a new trilogy, so it seems like a good time for it.

  His books are cynical, but not for its own sake, and he has some quite amazing characterizations. He's also quite genre-savvy, and plays with the form of the fantasy novel and forms and genres in general. He has a truly amazing talent for describing escalating chaos, situations spinning out of control in ways that are highly detailed and have a kind of verisimilitude.

  If I had to suggest an entry point, I wouldn't start with his original fantasy trilogy, *The First Law*. Read *Best Served Cold* instead. If you have a soft spot for YA, his YA series is quite good, it starts with *Half a King*.

  *Best Served Cold* is a revenge plot that takes the form of a series of heist-like setups. It's shockingly well executed. Here it is on Goodreads:

  https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2315892.Best_Served_Cold

  and here's Abercrombie's Goodreads page:

  https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/276660.Joe_Abercrombie

  I get the sense that we're in the middle of a bit of a drought on the subreddit for recommendations, and perhaps the web serial space is a little mined out. So I thought I'd focus on something a little different this time, hope someone finds it useful.
  ```

  - u/TMGleep:
    ```
    Could not agree more about Abercrombie, The First Law trilogy is brilliant, but would recommend against starting with Best Served Cold (and honestly I don't think Best Served Cold is all that great).

    I'd also caution against the YA series - the first book is good, but I found the second mediocre and the third outright poor.
    ```

    - u/Amonwilde:
      ```
      Funny, I found the first mediocre and the next two much better. Feels like we might have different tastes.
      ```

  - u/sparkc:
    ```
    I entirely agree with this recommendation; Abercrombie writes the best characters in published fantasy today. If you’re a fan of the larger-than-life but still believable characters of PGTE, their banter and the witty, sarcastic POV voice then there’s a good chance you’ll enjoy Abercrombie’s works because he’s the best I’ve ever read at that.

    He also writes some fascinating and unique concepts including a Fantasy Kill Bill, a fantasy Western, a fantasy story where the entire novel solely covers a 3 day battle and his latest trilogy is a fantasy industrial revolution; all of these within the same fantasy world too. 

    I agree with starting at Best Served Cold and then looping back and reading the rest of the First Law books in published order.

    (His very latest novel A Little Hatred was brilliant as well and i’m Interested to hear from others who have read it).
    ```

  - u/ElGuien:
    ```
    Second the author recommendation. However, I would actually recommend The First Law trilogy over Best Served Cold. Perhaps it's just the order I read them, but I found Best Served Cold to be a bit boring. The First Law is IMO iconic and has some great characters.

    Half a King series is also good.

    Another author/series I would recommend is Richard Nell's Ash and Sand series [(first book)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35994830-kings-of-paradise?ac=1&from_search=true). Like Abercrombie it has pretty good characters and a crappy world, but is more of a coming-of-age arc than straight grimdark. The way it's done doesn't give of that feeling of pointless hopelessness that a lot of grimdark stories do. For me that feeling is a hard block against reading "grimdark" fantasy - I can't read some series that many people seem to recommend highly like NK Jemisin The Hundred Thousand Kingdoms, anything by Mark Lawrence, R. Scott Bakker's Prince of Nothing etc.

  Have a couple odd requests:

  * A work that features real-world scientists or engineers with legitimate understanding of How Things Work coming into contact with those Who Claim To Understand How Things Work But Really Do Not (but can still maybe do amazing things, so they’re not just cranks). So, for example, something with interactions between mundane engineers and Worm tinkers, where the latter spout off some bullshit technobabble, but on further probing are revealed to have a barely passing high school understanding of mechanics or circuits or whatever. Basically exploring *why* tinkers can't just make a vastly simplified technology in their tinker specialty, or describe with connection to existing theory some of the basic principles under which their machinery operates (or, if further theory is needed, describe *that* theory until you eventually build up to the understanding necessary to figure out their tech)
  * A crossover between Harry Potter & Naruto, where Naruto was orphaned as a baby foiling the plot of the evil Madara Uchiha and goes to ninja school in Japan, run by headmaster Hiruzen Sarutobi, where he takes classes from the sketchy potions master Orochimaru and befriends muggleborn know-it-all Haruno Sakura etc. etc. etc. Or maybe Orochimaru is a better Voldemort surrogate (given the snake theme and obsession with immortality), but he'd be harder to tie into the Kyūbi plot
  * A work of fiction where one's power is inversely proportional to peoples' expectations. So to use another Worm example -- if you go up against a very self-confident Lung who believes himself able to trivially crush you beneath his heel, you're actually able to do the same to him. But if you appear the scary, strong monster to a small child, you're powerless to harm them. The updating happens in real-time, so if Lung takes note of your strength and invulnerability, you become proportionally weaker

  Some recommendations: I've been enjoying [this](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12703694/1/Harry-Potter-Geek-of-Magic) lately and think it might appeal to the sensibilities of some here. Pretty funny, too!

  A non-written recommendation: the website aliexpress.com! Has pretty much become my go to for all purchases of little electronic dongles, cheap plastic doodads, or really anything small & lightweight & generic. Most everything I've bought there is like 80-90% off what I can find elsewhere, you just have to wait a few weeks for shipping. Recent purchases have included a replacement Pixel 3 screen ($40 vs. $80), an NVME/PCI-E adapter ($2 vs $15), a cat backpack ($20 vs. $150), & a bunch of cheap, novelty jewelry (pretty much everything you'd find for $5-$20 when searching, say, 'science earrings' on etsy can be found on there for $0.5-$2, and afaict it's completely identical).

    > A work that features real-world scientists or engineers with legitimate understanding of How Things Work coming into contact with those Who Claim To Understand How Things Work But Really Do Not

    The interactions of the kook Vybegallo from [Monday Begins on Saturday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monday_Begins_on_Saturday) with the rest of the cast are a prime example of this.

    Also, "A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court" has some of this, especially towards the end.

    EDIT: looking over my shelves, got another one! Quite a bit of this in [Moribito](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moribito:_Guardian_of_the_Spirit), which contains a surprisingly pleasing portrayal of several characters applying the scientific method in a magical setting.

    Oh, and John Scalzi's The Collapsing Empire (although for at least some of the characters the stance is just a public facade put on for personal gain, a common trope in recent american SF IME)

    Not quite a crossover between Harry Potter and Naruto, but I just finished reading  [_Hollow Core_](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07WWZ4V4M) and you could easily call it "Harry Potter and the Cultivator's Clique".

    I'm not entirely sure I _liked_ the book, mind you - the protagonist is too much of a mushroom for my liking (he's kept in the dark and fed bullshit for most of the novel), but it was entertaining enough that I finished the thing.

    Edit: added a link, since the book's SEO is awful (apparently hollow-core slab is a kind of foundation used to build houses, who knew?)

  I've recently come up with a solution to a worldbuilding problem I posed to myself a while ago: Is it possible to create a hard magic system around the magic system of Harry Potter (a series which intentionally leaves a lot unexplained about magic) while following the spirit if not to the letter of the magic system that J.K. Rowling layed out in the books. In other words no direct contradiction but some minor indirect contradictions.

  People have definitely attempted and succeeded before:

  [Death by Water](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/death-by-water-harry-potter-the-culture.44788/), [Hacking the source of magic](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10446022/1/Continuing-HPMoR-Hacking-the-Source-of-Magic)

  But saying that magic was >!the prank of an ancient post-singularity alien race or where spells are programs and magicals users!< didn't feel satisfying and seemed to (figuratively) take away the magic of the setting.

  I was wondering if anyone has come across a Harry potter fanfiction or even original fantasy that has a magic system with a similar range of effects to harry potter's magic system but give more details on how the magic system works in a way that satisifies the following conditions:

  * All of magic (hopefully with many varied effects) is at least implied to have come from one source.

  * Magic is at least implied to be created in a process and doesn't just exist. This doesn't necessarily mean that magic is created by something intelligent, it can result from natural phenomena just as life resulted from evolution.

  * The explanation is satisfying and makes sense both before and after you think about it.

  * I'm not saying the system has to be perfect, there can be gaps and for magic to exist in story in the first place you need to have some level of suspension of disbelief.
  ```

  - u/dinoseen:
    ```
    Well, what's your solution? :P
    ```

  - u/CeruleanTresses:
    ```
    Unsounded has an excellent and internally consistent magic system. It is functionally "magic as programming," in that (for example) the way spells are cast emulates the process of giving instructions to a computer, but it's handled in an organic way that doesn't negate the magical-ness. The comic is ongoing so there isn't yet a full explanation of how it originated, but it is strongly implied that the metaphysical "network" that manages reality and carries out instructions from mages was created and doesn't just exist. There is a decent amount of info on the magic system in the comic itself, and the author answers fan questions about the finer details on her Tumblr.

    [The Gods are Bastards](https://tiraas.net) gets there eventually, but the physics of the transcension fields are poorly-explained in-story because the in-story universe is at about a 1900 level of magitech.

  - u/iftttAcct2:
    ```
    I'm honestly having trouble thinking of a rational(ish) source of magic in *any* story I've read, let alone an HP fanfic. Unless I'm misunderstanding what you're looking for?

    The closest I can come is some sort of divine source. I haven't read the two you linked to - what are their sources so I can see what you're looking for?

    I am really enjoying ["He who fights with monsters."](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26294/he-who-fights-with-monsters) It's 67 chapters in less than a month but they are fairly short chapters. Game elements, evil blood cultists, MC using psycological warfare. Might not be everyone's cup of tea but very well written so far.

      I'll second this rec. I like the MC and I think the author put a lot of thought into his powerset.

      - u/fortycakes:
        ```
        It definitely took a while to get going. It's not until at least >!once they reach the oasis town!< that the MC's personality gets any detail other than "I don't want to die.", but in the most recent chapters there are some interesting bits of both social shenanigans and casual uplift attempts (>!funding the alchemist trying to make cheap healing potions!<). It also helps the writing's technically good enough that I don't get a headache trying to parse it, unlike a few other RoyalRoad stories I've tried to read.

    I can think of four of good quality:

    * [Cultivating Earth](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25962/cultivating-earth) - My favorite at the moment, if the premise sounds good to you I heavily recommend giving it a try. Has not updated recently but the writing and story quality is excellent.

    * [Incompatable System](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/incompatible-system-mass-effect-au.777778/) - A side project of a well respected fanfic writer, you can read through the intro to see if you'll like it. Very good writing quality.

    * [A Major in Necromancy](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26574/a-major-in-necromancy) - Author does a good job at describing this one, good writing quality.

    * [Unnamed](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/unnamed.57272/page-2#post-12985753) - original story I found, pretty good, if a bit weird so far.
    ```

  - u/iftttAcct2:
    ```
    [Queen in the Mud](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26317/queen-in-the-mud)
    ```

  - u/IICVX:
    ```
    [Thieves' Dungeon](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/27261/thieves-dungeon) is really good so far. At this point it's just a well executed dungeon core story.

  What would you recommend to someone as an introduction to pro-immortality ideology? Preferably stand-alone stuff; fanfic would be counterproductive for this purpose, I think. Fiction or non-fiction, blog posts, whatever. I'd like something short (think large pamphlet) and something a bit longer (think short-story).
  ```

    ```
    [Transhumanism as Simplified Humanism](http://yudkowsky.net/singularity/simplified/) by Yudkowsky
    ```

  - u/Amonwilde:
    ```
    Not sure I subscribe fully to the ideology, but Bostrom's "The Fable of the Dragon-Tyrant" seems like a no-brainer here.

    https://nickbostrom.com/fable/dragon.html

    Not that I'm pro death, just that we might need to get our house in order before immortality as a priority ceases to look unseemly. Ecology, inequality, etc.
    ```

    - u/Lightwavers:
      ```
      It seems to me that immortality would force people to take the long view, thus eventually leading to a prioritization of climate cleanup, healthcare, welfare, equality, and so on.
      ```

      - u/Penumbra_Penguin:
        ```
        This is nice to think, but don't you think that immortality (for rich people at first) would cause those rich people to accumulate as much money as possible so they could enjoy being rich forever? I can see climate change becoming a priority, but the others seem optimistic.
        ```

        - u/IICVX:
          ```
          Yeah in the long term, non-immortals die so who cares about them?
          ```

      - u/Amonwilde:
        ```
        Unfortunately, I think the issue is more complicated. Most people in their 30s are likely to experience relatively catastrophic climate change and have to deal with startling inequality right outside their doors, right now and in the moment. I doubt adding immortality to that equation would make people overcome the coordination problems that exist now, and make the insulated elites anything but more insulated an elite.
        ```

        - u/Lightwavers:
          ```
          Really? So if you, for example, were given immortality right this moment, you wouldn't do anything different? Your long-term goals and plans would stay as they are?
          ```

          - u/Amonwilde:

      This sentiment is exactly what the fable is arguing against. We should do everything in our power to end aging as soon as possible. "But the problems..." Meh. We'll figure it out. Honestly, life extension is technology I'm least worried about by far. Climate change, war, etc. will kill some of us. Aging kills all of us.

  **Request:**
  Stories in with main protagonist major motivation to do hard or/and heroic things is love or friendship, like in the Good Student where >!Nic studied hard all his life for the chance to enroll in the school with his childhood friend/love interest(can't recommend this story, begging is cool but second half is just no good in my opinion)!<. The "purer" the fellings the merrier. Fantasy preferred.
