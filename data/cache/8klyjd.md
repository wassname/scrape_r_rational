  Saw someone mention my book here earlier and I remembered that some people in the subreddit might be interested.

  For those of you who aren't already familiar, [Sufficiently Advanced Magic](https://www.amazon.com/Sufficiently-Advanced-Magic-Arcane-Ascension-ebook/dp/B06XBFD7CB/) is a novel with a mix between dungeon crawling and time spent learning magic at an academy. 

  It's set in a world that's heavily inspired by Japanese RPGs like Final Fantasy and the Tales series, but where game mechanics are treated like normal elements of the world. For example, there are justifications for respawning monsters, dungeons with rooms that constantly changing, character classes, levels, etc.

  There's a heavy emphasis on learning the rules of how magic works. If you enjoy that sort of thing, you might like these books.

    I finished the second book yesterday and is great. Much better than the first. You rock

      How is it better? I read the first and generally found it to be meh. Is it worth trying the 2nd?

      Edit: Just to be clear, I don't think this was a bad book and I don't mean any criticism about the work to the author. it was quite well written and it did keep me reading through to the end, it just wasn't quite for me, I think.

        The first i found it to be ok. In spite a couple of flaws. Biggest i think it to be too infodumpy and with an ending cut 50 pages too soon to be truly satisfing. 

        This one had all the good bits with much smaller info dumps. Less teenage drama. A few new characters that are really engaging and cute (i love researcher) and an ending that is much better

        Not if you disliked the first.

        I am loving the second, but I loved the first too. It isn't different enough to warrant a chance if you have already found the series not to your tastes.

        But then I am only like 40% through it so my opinion might be worthless.

          I didn't dislike the first, I just wasn't drawn in. I found the way magical power was gained to be too arbitrary: powerful entities give it to people to further their own goals, but also as reward for solving puzzles and whatnot for no particularly clear reasons. Is it similar in the 2nd?
          ```

        I just finished the second, it's similar to the first just done better imo. I think it fixed some of the problems the first had, and is a pretty fun book. Overall though it's a sequel, and if you didn't like the first, you might not like the sequel.

      I'm glad you liked it more than the first one! Thanks for the support.

    Not heard of it before but I'm a fan of the LitRPG genre and Sufficiently Analyzed Magic is my favorite trope, so I'm greatly looking forward to reading it!

      I hope you end up enjoying it!

      I'm glad you enjoyed it enough to read it all at once! That's fantastic.

      And I'm glad we apparently have some similar tastes in other works, too. =)

    Loved it! Minor editing error, I think: at location 8214 in the kindle ebook, Sheridan is referred to as a woman:

    >"Hah! Good. You're learning." Sheridan glanced over to her dog, then back to me.

    Everywhere else it's in the neutral they.

  Hey! What was Zorian doing at the Climbers Court?
  ```

  - u/LLJKCicero:
    ```
    Probably the same thing as Simon in the first book: being a cameo.
    ```

    - u/Salaris:
      ```
      Yup. Maybe I'll see if I can convince the authors to write some side stories someday or something, but I doubt it. =)
      ```

      - u/JackYAqua:
        ```
        Is there going to be a new cameo in each book, totaling seven? 
        If so, do you have those planned out already?
        ```

          > Is there going to be a new cameo in each book, totaling seven? If so, do you have those planned out already?

          There'll probably be one or more cameos in each book, but I haven't pre-planned them.

            I got the stupidest fucking grin when Zorian showed up.

            So, this series is going to have *seven* books? Damn, no wonder poor Corrin is always so outmatched.

  Loved the first one. Although I still will be waiting for the audiobook. Will the voice actor be the same as for sufficiently advanced magic? I really enjoyed him.
  ```

  - u/Salaris:
    ```
    We're trying to get Nick for the sequel again, but he's super busy. The answer is "probably".
    ```

- u/None:
  ```
  /u/Salaris You want typos again? It'll take me a while to finish it this time. So far I've only seen:

  I might not like his personality, but he’s already involved, and we can be reasonably confident **he’s** wasn’t working with Orden.

  Around location 3129 in the kindle ebook.
