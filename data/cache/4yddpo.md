## [RT][C][TH] The Facilitator

### Post:

At the end of the 21st century, an AI designer makes a last ditch attempt to save herself from bankruptcy, with unexpected results. A short story about transhumanist concerns. What does the subreddit think of the scenario?

  Fun. Very cyberpunk. Not very technically accurate. Doesn't arouse a lot of emotion in the reader.

    Thanks for that :). I'm somewhat surprised that the Facilitator actually obeyed orders at the end, however, rather than just simulating obedience (or, since we didn't see much beyond that, perhaps it *was* a simulation?...).
