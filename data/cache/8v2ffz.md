## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  How about the final boss of the story I'm never going to write? This is a reverse munchkin scenario turned up to 11. Hopefully I can just dump a ton of the relevant worldbuilding, since I don't think anyone could figure this out without the background.

  **Setting**

  You're in a world where, rather than magic being a feature patch on top of physics, physics is fundamentally a result of magic. Things work differently here; eyes work by sensing objects directly, not through transfer of light; there is neither air nor air resistance, but there is a fundamental speed cap that some things hit, like missile weapons and people specialized in the magic; and nigh every aspect of the universe can be molded at will by sufficiently skillful mages: if a property varies, there is doubtlessly a magic that affects it directly.

  Magics are rather mechanistic in nature, more science than sport, but the personal benefits from being a skilled mage and the very un-Earth-like nature of their reproduction─one literally builds the child out of their own torn flesh, and donates to it some substance of one's own mind and magic─results in guilds and lineages taking strong precedence over prototypical scientific establishments. Most mages specialize in a few specific fields, because the art is difficult and power scaling is very nonlinear; the downside is that specialism in a branch of magic results in increasing value drift towards exploitation of that ability. This world's natural disasters happen when somebody achieves too much in the wrong thing. Much of the society's resources are keeping at bay the many shapeless extensions and copies of the first (and only) divine shapeshifter, who figured out how to perform mitosis and transform himself arbitrarily─nearly all of the world's natural fauna and flora has been replaced by thick forests of his mindless lovecraftian mass.

  **The protagonist and antagonist**

  Your primary claim to power is your divinity in Will, the magic that affects the inherent randomness effusing the universe to achieve your outcomes, a kind of "luck", if you will. The divinity placed you in a Groundhog-esque time loop, starting at a given point─currently locked at the moment you gained your divinity, but you can bring it forward permanently if you so need─and ending at the point of your death. As a result of value drift, your place no particular ethical weight on the continuity of others' lives, so it does not bother you that restarting the loop kills everybody else, except inasmuch as you valued those people in particular. Since your are simulating this character, you should keep this in mind. Having a divinity in Will gives you effectively limitless time to learn any other magic to any degree of proficiency, though keep in mind that certain kinds of value drift make certain skills dangerous to learn beyond a certain point.

  Most people think your adversary is god, but you now know that he's actually "just" an old mage from many generations back that acheived through some means, as best you can tell, all the known divinities. Of note, he has maximum strength, and is unaffected by physical forces, poisons, or fire. He can move at the speed cap and split into multiples; not the unrefined trees of flesh that have invaded the world's borders, but a clean, idealized reproduction. Mind magic doesn't affect him, just like the other properties, since a divine can at worst draw in their own field. Even if you could bypass these, he has an immortal's regeneration, and should you somehow kill him even then, his time loop almost certainly precedes yours, wiping you out of the equation and doing little to him. Most powers you can learn would only allow you to tank his blows, rather than vice versa; having a divinity in strength would make you immune to his punches, but do nothing to stop him being immune to yours (I suppose you could headlock him, if not for him being able to shapeshift, burn you to death, move much faster than you, and mindrape you into compliance if those all fail).

  The first time you spoke with him you threatened to loop on him; he laughed and said that if he was worried about that he would have just made you immortal. You don't know whether he could actually do that. When you spoke to him in later loops, he seemed as though he followed you through. You now believe he was just reading your mind and acting as if he knew about them all along. In all, he would almost certainly be afraid of true death, but which particular instance of him is the living one seems to be unimportant.

  You want some form of leverage over him. You don't need to actually hurt him, but you do need something that threatens him. At present you have nothing. You should have at least enough here to find my solution, but I'd be interested to see what others can find.

    Get a divinity in mind magic first as a matter of course so you can't be mind controlled.

    This dude has got to be pretty bored. Spend a few loops coming up with a really interesting game with a ridiculous amount of depth, then a few more loops getting ridiculously good at it. Offer to play with him, and iterate on design until you find something he likes, then play regularly until it's an established part of his life that he enjoys.

    If he ever does anything you don't like, heavily cut back game time. If he tries to force you to play suicide. If he works out a way to force you to play anyway play badly. Ideally none of that ever comes up and now both of you have something interesting to do as down time.

    Try not to get more attached to the game than he is, just in case.
    ```

    - u/Veedrac:
      ```
      Not sure how practical it is, but points for out-of-the-box thinking. I'll definitely mull over some variations of this, since it's certainly something the protagonist could have considered.
      ```

  - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
    ```
    How exactly does your time loop work? Does it really kill everybody else? Including the old mage? If so, doesn't triggering your time loop already kill him and replace him with another version of himself? That's a pretty effective threat right there.

    You just need to keep yourself on the verge of death 24/7, so you can commit suicide faster than the old mage, meaning he can't trigger his time loop to erase you before you erase him.

    Alternatively, if it turns out that your belief is wrong and that the old mage actually loops with you whenever you restart, the above strategy still works. That's because you can threaten mutually assured destruction by bringing your time loop starting point to just before the moment of your death, effectively creating an infinitesimally short time loop that the old mage can never escape from since there's no time for him to kill himself to escape via his own time loop. So you'll both eventually go insane from the never ending unchanging repetition.
    ```

    - u/Veedrac:
      ```
      > Does it really kill everybody else? Including the old mage?

      Yes (and you're an expert so you're pretty certain), but "which particular instance of him is the living one seems to be unimportant" to him, presumably as a result of value drift.

      Threatening suicide is actually part of an earlier plot in the story; being able to use it here would be stale ;).

    Why would immortality prevent your reset? Anyone's immortality preventing everyone's reset seems to contradict his words.

    A simple way for him to permanently calm his fear of death is to send a copy out at maximum speed, then permanently advance the checkpoint to just after that in case someone convinces him from his ways in the future.

    This value drift appears to simplify. Conjecture: Magic's primitives/divinities correspond one-to-one with the components of the human value system.

    If you can save/restore another's mind state, teaching a divinity to a subordinate preserves your values. The antagonist might still value that which one can have a lackey sacrifice without rendering him uncontainable.

    Rhetoric divinity appears to win one's future maxspeed cone. Assuming he hasn't won, even he must shy away from the corresponding sacrifice.
    ```

    - u/Veedrac:
      ```
      Checkpoints aren't shared. The world resets at your checkpoint when you die, and at the antagonist's checkpoint when he dies, should that ever happen.

      > Why would immortality prevent your reset?

      Because you can't die (and don't *want* to die─that's part of the value drift inherent to immortality), and it only triggers on death.

      > If you can save/restore another's mind state, teaching a divinity to a subordinate preserves your values.

      You can save/restore minds with strong enough mind magic, but that's extremely rare. The subordinate only preserves your values if they end up fixing your mind, but for that scenario to happen you need to have a divine mind mage subordinate to you but able to use their magic on you against your will. That sounds difficult.

      E: I think I misread. Are you saying you would teach the divinity to the subordinate, and copy that mind of theirs from one loop to another? Then you can exploit their abilities without suffering the drawbacks yourself. That does make sense.

      > The antagonist might still value that which one can have a lackey sacrifice without rendering him uncontainable.
      >
      > Rhetoric divinity appears to win one's future maxspeed cone. Assuming he hasn't won, even he must shy away from the corresponding sacrifice.

      I'm struggling to parse these sentences, sorry.

    The first step is to achieve proficiency in deception and broad-optimization magics.

    By "deception" I mean improving yourself until you can reliably fool the enemy into not realizing the existence of your time loop. Achieve divinity in mind magic (mind shields? decoy minds?) first. If there are related social magics (e. g., an actual "deception" magic?), master them too; if there aren't, become the best actor a human could ever be.

    By "broad-optimization magics" I mean magics akin to Will, which seems to globally optimize events according to your utility function. What others are there? The Enemy has all of them, and they're likely to foil any plan against him if you don't have a symmetric advantage. If further improvement after achieving divinity is at all possible, try to *surpass* the antagonist in them; spend several googols of years on it if necessary (modify yourself to have infinite patience if necessary).

    Once those are achieved, the preparations are complete: you're at least as "lucky" as the enemy, and you have an information advantage in that you know he is in a time loop, while he doesn't know about yours. That information advantage can grow.

    Use your time loop to carefully mine his instances for information. The full extent of his powers, his personality, his contingencies, why he made the crucial mistake of allowing the world to remain in such a state that someone with your power was able to appear, et cetera. Use the standard timeloop precaution of killing yourself the moment something surprising happens, obviously.

    Eventually, you will have a complete picture of what he is. Use it to manipulate him.

    He can't be mindraped or killed, but I assume he can change as a person^(1). Since you have a timeloop advantage over him, that means you can manipulate him into anything.

    Spend some time (a decade? a century?) learning how to get him to develop a minor habit (e. g., a preference for certain speech patterns). Then how to cultivate a major habit. Then an opinion. A belief. A different belief. Two beliefs. A set of beliefs.

    Use however much time you need. Thousands of century-long loops for a minor habit is acceptable. 

    Once proficiency in manipulating him is achieved, shape his personality into whatever form you find convenient, over the course of an arbitrarily long loop. Optionally, get him to not resist while you use mind magic to erase his mind.

    A global victory.

    ___

    ^(1. This is actually a major assumption, now that I think about it. If he has divinity in every magic, he has value-drift from every magic. Is he, in fact, still a "person", or just a collection of magics trying to use itself? Perhaps people who call him god are more right. Or perhaps he has a meta-divinity in suppressing value drift, or uses mind magic to do so?)

  In a world of minor super powers, you can create an electric current that is always 1 volt, directed away from you. You need either A. Line of sight B. Direct physical contact or C. An in depth understanding of where everything is situated in order to direct your power. The current is limited to a maximum of an 8 foot radius, centered on whichever body part is creating the current. How do you take over the world?


  **edit**: Oops, the power was supposed to be creating a current of 1 Amp, not volts. I had the units switched in my head.
  ```

  - u/holomanga:
    ```
    You can superheat blocks of metal - since they're conducting, a modest potential difference creates an enormous flow of electrons. Wikipedia says a 1 cm^(3) block of silver has a resistance of a microohm, which gives you a megawatt of power dissipated. This keeps going up until your conductor melts.

    EDIT: For a current of one amp, the principle is the same, except you should now use it on an insulator, which gives you an enormous potential difference and therefore an enormous power dissipation. I think this keeps going until your insulator's electrons dissociate, at which point you get a conducting plasma. This happens at about 10,000 K.
    ```

    - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
      ```
      That raises a curious issue: what happens if you use your power on a superconductor? Current = Voltage / Resistance, and Resistance is 0 for a superconductor. So using your power to create a 1 volt current on a superconductor literally forces the universe to divide by zero.
      ```

    1 amp through a large x-ray tube would make for a reasonably effective weapon.

    But since we're talking take-over-the-world, how about some classic rules lawyer munchkinery?

    1) A sustained electric current is always a loop, since electron density can't go below zero

    2) The power produces a current with a hard distance limit of 8 feet, so no outwardly directed current extends beyond the 8 foot limit.

    3) The return current must therefore also have the same distance limit.

    4) By basic geometry, the closer we get to the 8 feet limit the tighter the turns return current paths have to make

    Enter [Braking Radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bremsstrahlung)! Electrons making turns emit electromagnetic radiation, with frequency (and energy) a function of the the acceleration involved. So as the turn gets tighter the radiation will go from radio waves to visible light, ultraviolet, right up to X-rays and gamma rays.

    Gamma rays can be ridiculously energetic, and by pushing the current to *juuuuuust* under 8 feet we can make [ultra high energy gamma rays] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra-high-energy_gamma_ray) even more powerful than the most energetic cosmic rays. In principle each photon could have the power of an artillery shell.

    This should work without any special equipment but will be most effective when the turn is made in a vacuum so the electrons can travel faster. I.e. an X-ray tube without a conventional anode.

    The neat thing about this is that if the electrons are fast enough the radiation will be directed away from you, so with some shielding against backscatter it might even be possible to survive the experience.

    Pushing this to the limit, you could hold a country to ransom with a few milliamps and a "surrender or I will irradiate your largest city" speech. Either do that until the world surrenders or take over US/Russia/China/other space-faring country and threaten thousands of square kilometers at once from orbit.

    tl;dr: Abuse the hell out of the specific wording to make a synchrotron death cannon.

    Well, the first thing you need to do is figure out how exactly you are "creating" an electric current. Are you spawning electrons out of thin air? Or are you pushing electrons around? If it is the former, what happens if you try to spawn electrons inside other matter? If it is the latter, what happens if you try to create electric currents where there are no electrons? Do you start pushing protons instead? Can you push protons out of atoms? All these questions have potentially fun nuclear consequences.

      The vector of the power is pushing electrons. If there are no electrons there is nothing to push.

    Can I take a transformer and change the voltage? And power my cell phone with it? 

    Where does the energy come from? I assume limited energy but more energy than should be possible.

    Is it possible to built a power suit that is powered with my power? I would get a huge advantage, cause I didn't need a battery.

    Maybe built a coil gun. 


    Okay, away from superhero cliche. I could get an electric car. Or plane. And save on fuel costs.

    Well if I could use 2 volt by creating two currents via line of sight and touch, I could create Hydrogen gas from water. 

    Well that all depends on circumventing the 1 volt limit. I fear I don't know if 1 volt could be felt. If it can, I use it to pretend to be a prophet, except super powers should be known. Or if super powers are known, act like I have another power, like telling the truth and people tested by me feel it. And mess with heads of states.

    Well if I can go really ridiculous I could try to mess with the body chemistry. And with studying and many experiments kill people with a look, hours or weeks after meeting. Or change data on a computer... How much voltage does a computer need to change zeroes and ones... googled 3.3 Volt as the lowest number, so nope...

    Well, I guess I would ignore my power and try to take over the world the old fashioned way. Becoming a populist and tell people what they want to hear. Train my own brainwashed elite soldiers, and take over one country with voting (not necessarily legal or fair votes). Make me ruler for life, attack other countries under false pretense (Maybe dispose of other dictators). Let my countries spies fight an underground war and spread propaganda abound me and tell them bad stuff (not always lies) about their leaders. And promise better conditions under my rule. 

    Maybe start some unions (EU, NATO, UN) and take that over. 

    My power would help only in some minor ways, like pretending to be a prophet or able to tell lies.

    EDIT: Of course I would try to get other people with minor super powers on my site, or get rid of them without pissing them off.

    Buy a 100GOhm resistor. Running 1A through it results in a voltage of 100 GV across it. Now you have some options:

     Weaponize your newfound box of lightning. Not only can it arc electricity to the nearest sink, it can cause explosions (which combined with a nozzle is also a means of transportation)  and turn many materials into soot 

    Solve the free energy problem and simply buy the world with the profits.

    Talk to some researchers and create new materials by using processes that are normally limited by power issues, then use the materials to do one of the above.

  You secrete a substance that can allow you to animate, control, see, and hear through objects coated by it. "Animate" allows objects to move within their normal range of flexibility and then some. For example: if you animate a marble, it can roll at walking speed; if you animate a stick, it can bend slightly to crawl like a caterpillar; if you animate a suit of armor, it can get up and walk and fight clumsily. Your control is roughly equivalent to Skitter's control of bugs in Worm; that is, pretty much absolute. It also grants the appropriate level of multitasking ability - you can act simultaneously from as many controlled objects as you like. Your secretion is permanent. 

  Limitations: Simple soap and water can remove your control-substance from almost anything. Control and flexibility weaken the larger the ratio of mass-to-secretion; a drop of secretion can only viably control about 100 grams of object. You get more fine control with more secretion, but diminishing returns apply. The best control you can expect is to be able to move e.g. a mostly-coated suit of armor as if you were wearing it. You cannot control living things (but you can control their clothing). If a non-coated piece is cut away from a coated object, you lose control of the non-coated part. Stiff objects move slowly, if at all; supple objects like cloth have plenty of motion but are relatively weak. Small objects also move slowly. 

  Circumstances: For further "creative narrowing," munchkin within these constraints. Assume no technology higher than medieval (no gunpowder). You are trying to defend a castle against humanoid invaders. You have years of prep time if you need it - long enough to coat just about everything needed, but not enough to generate pools of the secretion (not that you'd want to). Your attackers know your power, but haven't seen you use it. 
  The spying applications of this power are trivial to abuse; I am interested in the combat applications. 

  Full disclosure: am GM in a homebrew Pathfinder campaign, looking for ideas I haven't already come up with for screwing with players. They're high level, they can take it. I have tweaked the circumstances somewhat.

    Coating trebuchets and Catapults to out siege the siegers

    Golems wielding un-secreted swords, or simply replacing the armored gauntlets with blades.

    Depending on how complex you can build, some wheeled/spiked "car" to either transport the golems or act as a highly mobile "tank", that is, it just tries to steamroll/roadkill invaders. That also works for inside the castle too, like a piston on wheels version of the indiana jones stone ball.

    Inside the castle, cloth whips could make a good impression of those half life [Barnacles](http://half-life.wikia.com/wiki/Barnacle)

    Crossbows that are covered in secretion could maybe reload faster than humans, so if repeating crossbows are a thing yet, then more golems with crossbows.

    If your secretion can be protected with varnish or paint to protect it from rain, then that would certainly be a good idea.

    I expect as far as golems go, you could probably roll with some ...creative... designs. Much like how dark souls has wheeled skeletons, the physical design of your secretion-minions can be all over the place.

    Muderholes filled with extending secretion controlled spikes would be a good idea, too. Place a carpet over it?

    How much do you secrete over time? Power in numbers. Small, high-damage weapons en mass are likely the best bet. Some early thoughts, nothing gamebreaking:

    * I suspect that armies of bows effectively maximises firepower.
    * Traps can be controlled with small quantities of secretion, since you only need the lever to be active. They can also be autonomous.
    * Having an automated factory is probably extremely useful.
    * Threads with poisoned needles on could be deadly en mass, since they can crawl under armor, and jab weak points directly. They should probably be fired from the aforementioned bows.
    * If you're alone, your castle does not need entrances or stairs, since you don't need to support a population; fill those with rubble and get a rope to let you up when you come and go. Put contraptions around the top of walls to knock off ladders. Grow masses of thorns around the castle.
    * Typical defenses like boiling oil and whatnot still make sense, even if they aren't magnified.
    * Your greatest risk seems to be enemy siege weapons; coating them with your secretion (either from a projectile or through pre-placed mobile traps down below) allows you to sabotage them.

    As WilyCoyotee mentioned, whips and flails are good. I would harvest and weave spider silk instead of leather -- it's much lighter and stronger. I would need to do the math, but you may be able to make a spider silk chain for some bolos thin enough to cut anyone unarmored. Also make some thick self tangling nets to launch. Add arrows trailing threads of spider silk to increase annoyance. 

    Special weapons for catapults: 
     - Strong sealed containers (made of two layers of oilled cloth with an inner layer of clay). These serve as guidance with an external payload than can contain an flammable/poisonous/acid that can roll to the Target after being launched.
    - Guided missiles/bombs. Add stearing fins, bend fins to steer.
    - Air burst weapons - Fill canisters with some area denial weapon, trigger release above ground to get good spread. 
    Note that combining guided airburst shots containing dry finely milled flour with a single fire arrow can result in a nice explosion, though you may want to prepare the target with oil first for maximum effect.

    The goop could probably run a good pumping infrastructure so water traps are possible (such as a staircase with 3ft of water moving down it constantly).

    The usual fake walls/ceilings/floors (thin stone veneer over goop covered traps) that come alive to attack (whips and nets from the ceiling, bolos and arrows from the sides, floor has thin threads that grab at their feet).
    Caltrops that move underfoot (lightly mixed with regular ones).

    Can scrolls or magic items controlled by this substance cast themselves /expend charges?

    Could make the wizard's spell book eat itself. (snap open and shut all night until the pages are destroyed)

    Use the substance to control more of the substance for long distance fuckery

    The villain knows all the heroes plans if he chooses to listen to them by hiding a drop in someone's hair or shoe

    Some clever use of magic or even a mundane bellows might be enough to effectively (though not technically) aerosolize an amount of the substance, creating areas full of the stuff in the air until it settles - which could cause trouble for someone who walks through the space

    Or control the shoes of heroes who step in it, creating difficult terrain that your ambush party automatically ignores

    Mix with something that doesn't wash off as easily and keeps the soap from taking your substance with it for a nasty surprise when the heroes have learned to wash everything they encounter before getting close.

    Make a stick figure out of rope and coat it with goop. Wrap each piece of rope with cloth that has been covered with more goop. Repeat this a number of times until you have something the size and shape of a grown human, with each layer gooped. Put this inside a suit of armour that has been gooped inside and out. You should now have an armoured golem with more strength, weight and durability than a gooped empty suit of armour.

    Golem-spiders spread around would act as spies.

    Coating arrows in goop would let archers fire volleys of guided missiles, ensuring that all arrows are concentrated where they can deal the most damage.

    Coating a ship with goop would essentially let you sail it by itself, and wooden planks connected by strips of leather would serve as crude oars (though not as strong as regular rowers). Obviously you would need to stick several layers of materials together with goop and then lacquer the outside wherever possible.

    A wooden skeleton wrapped in leather and sealed airtight with a number of metal legs would be heavy enough to sink, and with enough legs you could walk it across the bottom of the ocean, maybe transport troops for a surprise attack across a river or bay. The challenge would be opening/closing without flooding (probably from underneath) and not running out of air.
