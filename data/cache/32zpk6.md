## Understanding Technology

### Post:

Hi guys,

So I'm about 41,000 words into my first novel, and I'm looking for some general writing advice. I'm wanting my characters, all of them, good and bad, to be acting intelligently and rationally within the bounds of their own knowledge. That's just it though, within the bounds of their own knowledge.

I have one society, the society the main character is from, that has existed at the technological equivelant of the middle ages for at least the last century, while the outside world hit the industrial revolution. This dark ages society is attempting to conduct a revolution against the technologically superior empire that has controlled them, and they've managed to get their hands on such things as encyclopaedias, reference books, technical manuals, and other scientific data, along with a large number of this civilisations tools. Things like radios, guns, etc. 

So they have all the technology, maybe not as much of it, but they have it. But can they *understand* it? They have everything they'd need to, but to give an example, would my characters realize that if they talk to each other over a radio they can be eavesdropped on? Would they really understand modern war tactics when previously they're used to stories of knights fighting dragons? Its a tricky line to draw. 
On one hand, I want my characters to be smart, I don't want them to do stupid things because the plot requires it.
On the other hand, I don't want the characters to be able to make completely magical leaps of thinking and make realizations that someone with their level of understanding shouldn't have noticed. They should be smart, not superhuman. 

How much core science would someone from the middle ages be able to understand if exposed to 1900s level technology and given the resources to delve into it? Would they actually be able to, within a reasonable timeframe, learn not just what a piece of technology is, but how and why it works the way it does, such that they could predict how it might be used against them?

  First of all, your Middle Ages society better make sure that their revolution stays completely dark until they're ready to go. The outer world has more of the tech and more experience with it; the MA society will need some brilliant strategy, clear tech advantage, or outside allies in order to avoid defeat. 

  As to understanding the tech, it depends on what exactly they have. If they just had radios and cannons then no, they wouldn't get it. You said they have encyclopedias and tech manuals; they probably still won't get it. They need books about basic science and, more importantly, the scientific method.  Until they understand the scientific method they are going nowhere -- from your description they might or might not have it. 

  Outside of that, they need to run war games with their new toys. Have promotion depend on performance in the games (being on the winning team not being relevant as long as you yourself behaved smartly and loyally). 

  A couple of problems they're going to have: using up ammo during testing with no way to resupply, and accidentally giving themselves away while testing. If the outside world hears radio transmissions coming from DarkAgia, they're going to want to know what's up. 

  Where did they get the materials from in the first place? If they stole them, someone should be looking for them. If they bought them, can they get their supplier to give lessons? Can they hire trainers and instructors from the outside world?

  If I were them, I would having children learning about the technology and playing around with it. Children have an enormous advantage over adults in learning new patterns and ideas, even if adults are better at applying the ideas. So children are probably more likely to think of the eavesdropping idea because they would play around with the radios in a war game and stumble on it.

  Children also are less prone to [Functional Fixedness](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_fixedness) and therefore are better at coming up with new uses and how it can be applied to more aspects of life than how the more advanced empire would use them.

  Just an idea to justify the odder leaps of thought.

    >__Functional fixedness__ is a [cognitive bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_bias) that limits a person to using an object only in the way it is traditionally used. The concept of functional fixedness originated in [Gestalt Psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestalt_Psychology), a movement in psychology that emphasizes [holistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holism) processing. [Karl Duncker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Duncker) defined functional fixedness as being a "mental block against using an object in a new way that is required to solve a problem."  This "block" limits the ability of an individual to use components given to them to complete a task, as they cannot move past the original purpose of those components. For example, if someone needs a paperweight, but they only have a hammer, they may not see how the hammer can be used as a paperweight. Functional fixedness is this inability to see a hammer's use as anything other than for pounding nails; the person couldn't think to use the hammer in a way other than in its conventional function.

  Honestly, their best bet is to draw the outside country into a guerrilla war on the borderlands, using the modern society's civilian's as hostages against the possibility of WMDs. Their greatest advantage is the terrain and local support, as well as figuring out the points of failure on foreign military equipment and protocol and exploiting them.

  And, yeah, have the children grow up puzzling their way through the diagrams. Go for the other side's civilians, too - a couple sympathetic teachers and skilled trades workers in various fields would be enough to kickstart a tech base with a bit of imagination, resourcefulness, and good management.
