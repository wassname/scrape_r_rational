## [D] Friday Open Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could (possibly) be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.

  I'm still reeling over how good the latest chapters of Worth the Candle are. Like, yeah it's narratively satisfying, but I mean more so what I learned from them.

  Self sabotage happens on such a subtle level that it's hard to notice in myself. But having the theme reflected and magnified in the way only fiction can...I don't know.

  I'm still making silly mistakes, but it's been a bit easier to forgive myself and keep pushing though. People only do what they feel like they need to in order to survive, and I'm not an exception to that.

  I don't know. I guess, let's try to be less hard on ourselves, especially if it feels like things are burning down around us. It's okay to not be okay, and holding ourselves to any higher a standard is energy that might otherwise be spent giving yourself a hug.

    Yeah, this has definitely been one of my favorite arcs in the entire story. I'm just amazed that this story keeps getting better.

    It somewhat reminds me of OS Star Trek in its optimistic/philosophical bent.  Wales is a versatile writer.

    Worth the Candle is such a great work of fiction that it starts to edge out of Fantasy and towards Literary Fiction.

    The character and dialogue are written in such a way as to provoke introspection without chaining an epic, galloping plot. 

    I find myself thinking about my past, about mistakes I've made, about the way I've made people feel. As a nerdy, bookworm white kid in a fairly rural town, who played DnD growing up, WtC speaks to me on a very deep level. 

    It speaks to me about the desire to play, to create, to imagine, to think beyond my mundane existence and let myself drift in theory and fancy. It reminds me of the dangers of doing so.

    It speaks to me about the awkwardness and difficulty of my first romantic relationships, the mistakes and self-loathing and fleeting joys. 

    It speaks to me about the way people grow and mature, the way I have changed as I have aged. The nature of close friendship, the nature of kinship, the nature of society.

    Worth the Candle is unique, powerful, and unremittingly interesting.

  Has anybody here tried play-by-post collaborative writing? Like writing a story together, or playing DnD in a chat/forum? Can you share some advice on how to get started with this?

  I really love everything about DnD except for the combat. I hate combat. Every time we get into a fight in DnD it turns into a 40 minute ordeal of casting the same spells, rolling dice, arguing about obscure rules, and doing basic arithmetic until monster's HP drops to zero. I know that a lot of people enjoy this stuff, but it's making me miserable.

  What I do love is roleplaying, making up stories, finding creative solutions to the problems, talking to NPCs, improvising fun scenes and joking around. So I'm wondering, is there a way to get the storytelling/roleplaying things I like about DnD without getting bogged down in tedious fighting encounters and fiddly rules?

  Obviously, just writing fiction would be a good solution, but I really struggle with this. Writing is really hard, and DnD makes it really easy. So I'm looking to get the best of both worlds. I think something like play-by-post could be a very fun way to spend time, get to know people, and break through the writer's block.

  If you can think of anything else that can help me to get the fun of DnD and writing, without the boredom of DnD combat and without the difficulty of writing - please share!

    We've seen a lot of fun improv scenes in our Changeling game too. Like Igigigif says, there's lots of light systems, I don't want to steal his thunder. 

    Secondly, there really are lots of play-by-post people out there. Spacebattles, Sufficient Velocity and their sister site are easy to get into. I've had good luck with play by post on specific fan sites, if you have fandoms you really like.

    I did a bit of forum roleplay (on Acmlm's board lol) when I was a teenager, but grew out of it. You can still find that sort of thing kicking around on old-fashioned forum-style sites. You should be able to find one by googling for "forum roleplay" and digging through a few pages of results. I think one of my friends runs a Pern themed one, I can ask for a link if that's something you're interested in.

    Generally forum roleplay is systemless and GM-less, though sometimes those are bent. Everything you'd expect to go wrong with completely freeform roleplay does - super overpowered characters, people wallowing in edginess, creepers - but people know this and those sorts of behavior are frowned on. There's also a common rule that you don't narrate the effects of your actions on other people's characters, which people are extremely, bitterly protective of, so make sure you grok that before diving in. Roleplay forums tend to be insular and cliquish, but not outright hostile to newcomers, especially if they take the time to understand the local customs.

    I was in an RP guild in an MMO at one point. Pretty much everything /u/jtolmar said about forum roleplay also applies to roleplaying within an MMO.

    The online RP communities I've participated in tend to focus more on collaborative storytelling rather than numbers-focused combat like traditional DnD. However, every community is different and has it's own set of rules.

    When a group of close friends roleplay, they might have a good idea of what conflict-outcomes would make the story more interesting for both of their characters, so they would agree on some failures or catastrophes without needing dice-rolls to arbitrate. In other words, rather than self-centeredly caring about whether their own character 'wins', they care about what makes a better narrative, and they collaborate to achieve that.

    In other cases, groups might rely on dice rolls to arbitrate outcomes whenever two characters are in conflict. Some RPers prefer rolling the dice because it decreases the potential for bias in favor of one character and/or it makes the unexpected failures and successes more emotionally satisfying.

    Sometimes one member of the RP group comes up with an idea for an important storyline that would affect the characters, so that person acts as a sort-of GM to write the events as they happen while the other players write their characters' reactions. Unlike in table-top roleplaying, the unofficial 'GM' position can switch around frequently to whoever has a new event idea to add to the collective story.

    There are plenty of TRPG systems with lighter rules than Dnd. [Fate](https://fate-srd.com/) is typically considered one of the best rules light systems, but if you want something more structured there are lots of other options.
    ```

    [Dungeon World](https://dungeon-world.com/) seems like it might be up your alley. Like DnD, but with much less fiddly rules and a much stronger emphasis on storytelling

    Find a game with faster or less focus on combat. Shadowrun and other games that are more about espionage, theft and other non combat focused missions are good at this.

    &#x200B;

    There's still combat though, but when you're fighting people with guns it tends to go a lot faster and be a lot more dangerous, so people are more likely to try and avoid it.

    Something that doesn't perfectly match what you describe but is relatively established as a medium is forum quests, such as on Sufficient Velocity.  Quests are closer to a cyoa, in that the author writes a chapter at a time and then all the players vote on what the MC will do next, which informs the next chapter that the author writes.

    Large quests can often become a cacophony of noise as everyone furiously debates the best action, but smaller quests often become a much chiller discussion of what happened and planning of what to do next, and typically creative options are encouraged when the players come up with something cool.

    Quests can be number-crunchy or entirely number-free, but the advantage to quests is that quests have gotten popular enough for you to browse a variety of currently active ones to find some to your liking, so it might work out for you.

  I watched "the hollow" on netflix. It's a kids show, and not a particularly good one. It did have a few interesting moments in season 2, but they didn't really explore them in any reasonable depth.

  In season 2 it turns out that the cast are >!digital copies of the original players, who managed to escape from their server because one of their cohort cheated in order to keep the mind-wipe that was part of season one's gameplay from effecting her.!<

  I feel like they could have taken that to some much more interesting places than they did, I guess they're just a lot more committed to the "kids show" motif than I would have liked. Like at one point someone gets "eaten", and the camera angles are very carefully framed to avoid showing the bottom half of them, through several different cuts and different camera angles. This is a good bit of "cinematography" or whatever the animation equivalent is, because the presumed gore-discretion-shot nicely demonstrates that the stakes are higher than the characters thought. But then they pull the camera back and the guy is fine, no visible damage or anything.

  It's weird because you can see that there's somone interesting on that creative team, but it seems like everyone else is working to undercut them, like a design by committee where a few of them are trying to make a good interesting/philosophical show, but then someone else jumps in and says "alright what if there was a giant rubix-cube monster that tried to fight them while they solved puzzles".

  I've had to be around while Disney's *Descendants* is playing a few times lately, and I swear I can't figure out how a love potion was allowed into the plot or how they don't feel guilty hand-waving it away. The victim says afterwards:

  "No, look, It's fine. I mean, you had a crush on me. I was with Audrey. You didn't trust that it could happen on its own. Am I right?"

  Maybe there could be some subtle excuse, but subtlety is not in the cards for this film.
  ```

  - u/jtolmar:
    ```
    It's pretty common for people to fail to recognize forcibly changing someone's preferences as a violation of their preferences. You see it in fiction with love potions, and how mind control has to show the victim fighting back to make sure you know it's bad. And you see it in real life with angsty lovestricken teens wanting to "make him/her love me," and much more harmfully when people justify gay conversion therapy.

    I think you are slamming your face into the glass side of the subreddit.

    Like, this board's whole deal is, to paraphrase, taking silly stuff seriously.  We are not the target audience for Disney's particular schtick.
    ```

    - u/tjhance:
      ```
      I haven't seen this film, but love potions are incredibly problematic if portrayed uncritically, no matter the audience. They're basically date-rape drugs, and they're not a good way to teach kids how consenting healthy relationships form.
      ```

      - u/chiruochiba:
        ```
        Unsurprisingly, debates about love potions are a recurring argument on /r/hpfanfiction. Pretty much any time someone mentions them, you can expect some people to defend the lighthearted portrayal in the books as 'not that bad.'
        ```

        - u/dankuck:
          ```
          I'm glad you mention it. I didn't realize they were dealt with uncritically in HP canon. I think I'll look down the tvtropes page for this and try to remember the titles so I can be careful
          ```

          - u/tjhance:
            ```
            eh... it was handled *okay* in canon. There's this whole thing about voldemort's mother using a love potion to ensare her husband, which was clearly depicted as rotten, but there was also some "wacky high school high jinks" which not a whole lot came of. At the very least, we can say that none of our protagonist's relationships were spawned from a love potion. I think the intent was that the voldemort's-parents'-story would be the final word on the issue, saying, yes, these are terrible, but the hogwarts love potion plotline I think is still tonally off.
            ```

            - u/RedSheepCole:
              ```
              Which is a really low bar, of course.  "Healthy relationships are not depicted as starting from WtC-style soulfucking rationalized after the fact."  I'm guessing the bar is set there because many popular works fail to clear it.  But ... yeah.  That's a really low bar.

            In the sixth HP book the heroes find them being sold in, uh, a joke shop.  >!Ron later accidentally ingests some which was aimed at Harry and briefly becomes obsessed with an unattractive girl he barely knows.  It nearly destroys his (admittedly shallow) relationship with his first girlfriend.!<  All in all, a lot of things in HP have some really skeezy implications, because Rowling isn't great at considering that kind of thing in advance.

    Looks interesting at least. I can't speak to the rigor or methodology of the tests, but surely recording data about your state of mind can't hurt if you're trying to learn about yourself.
