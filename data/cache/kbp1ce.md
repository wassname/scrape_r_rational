## Searching for stories with Faustian type character

### Post:

I'm wondering if there are any stories in which the MC is a type of character that lives of Faustian bargains, as in give me your soul for unimaginable power or maybe just maximizing his gains with the littlest return, or maybe a creature that won't let you pass or kill you if you don't answer its riddle/challenge/test.

  A Practical Guide to Evil is all about Faustian bargains. Highly recommended.

  If you haven't watched it already, Puella Magi Madoka Magica is directly inspired by Faust. Though the character giving the deals is not the protagonist. I've never seen or read something where that is the case, unfortunately, as I'm not a big fan of villain protagonists.

  There’s a little known manga and anime called “The Laughing Salesman” that’s basically all about this, an entity going around offering deals that always have a very monkey paw like side to people who have some problem. It’s more of a collection of parables about various flaws and vices that destroy whoever makes the deal, though; the Salesman himself is just an enigmatic, never explained existence.

  You might be interested in [Dungeon Keeper Ami](http://www.lysator.liu.se/~bellman/dka.html) then. The whole story revolves around keepers, people or entities who sold their souls to the Dark Gods in exchange for magical powers, the ability to control certain areas as if they were gods, and the promise of more power by offering more sacrifices to the dark gods or paying mercenaries for their hard work.

  The protagonist is a moralist goody-two-shoes who wants to save the world, protect the innocents, etc. who is forced into becoming a keeper. But as the story progresses, she has to make bargains with evil people, choose between lesser evils and slowly become more Faustian because of the situation she's in, despite her initial ideals.
