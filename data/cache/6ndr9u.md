## [RST] (Flash game) Run 3

### Post:

[Run 3](http://www.kongregate.com/games/player_03/run-3) is a simple game with a minimalist excuse plot. You have to run through a tunnel with holes in it, and in the more difficult levels emptiness with platforms in it. I'd give a few highlights, but there's very little story so I feel like it would be spoiling it by having you read all the best rationalist parts beforehand.
