## [WIP][D][BS] National Novel Writing Month: Week 1

### Post:

This is a general purpose thread for anything you'd like to talk about for [National Novel Writing Month](http://nanowrimo.org/), which starts November 1st.

* Want to check in on making some progress?
* Want to talk about what you're writing?
* Out of ideas and want some help?
* Just need to vent about your story?

Feel free to make posts to the subreddit if you crank out a chapter you want to share, have a meaty question you want some help with, or something like that; this is more a place for things that aren't quite substantial enough to warrant their own posts.

[See the wiki page for past discussions.](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/nanowrimo)

  Vent: Transitioning from exposition to dialogue and back smoothly is hard. That is all.

    Yeah, especially a piece of paragraph-long exposition. In first person, it can read as though the character is thinking about this thing, rather than focused on the conversation, which isn't really how conversations work. You can do the exposition within the dialogue, but that can get super awkward too, especially if the exposition would be for something that both characters already know and wouldn't explain to each other.

    I have a preference for parentheticals as an aside to the reader, but they don't work in all contexts and "voices", and even those still grate on people.

      *raises hand*

      I once had someone ask me in the middle of a conversation to explain what I was thinking about with regards to what they were saying. In the time it took to explain the first paragraph of thought that had come in between their previous two sentences, another dozen paragraphs of thought had taken place.

  I should have started yesterday but eh. 
  Better late than never. 
  I'll start  writing right now.
  I would normaly use that as an excuse to start even latter but not this time.

  What are some easy ways to share a chapter online without exposing personal information? If I use my go-to, Google Docs, I end up sharing my name and I don't like doing something like that online. I'm not really sure of any good alternatives though.
  ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    Either set up a Google account under pseudonym, or post to some site without the full functionality of Google Docs, e.g. [Archive of Our Own](https://archiveofourown.org/), [FictionPress](https://www.fictionpress.com/), or [Pastebin](https://pastebin.com/)/[hastebin](https://hastebin.com/), though those might require making a secondary account anyway (not Pastebin/hastebin). There aren't a whole lot of good alternatives though, no.

      I'll add [Wattpad](https://www.wattpad.com/) to the list. It's slightly less known/used but seems pretty popular for self-published books of sorts, and most stuff on it has a more professional appearance (with covers and such). Still, the average level of writing is only marginally better than what I've found on other such sites, most of it is rather mediocre IMHO.

    I made an account on SufficientVelocity with a throwaway email and started a thread there.

  anybody have any advice for writing a flirty scene between two people who just met?

  I need to write a scene where a guy is kind of flirty, but not, like, overtly flirty. 

  (He's actually a spy and he's trying to test the waters to see if a romantic approach is useful for getting close to the protagonist, but he can't overdo it and risk scaring her off.)

  Thing is, I don't even know how to write a normal flirty scene. How does real, non-caricature flirting work?
  I'm guessing the answer is something like "genuine-sounding, non-shallow compliments". Is there anything else?
  ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    With the caveat that I've been married for six years and haven't actually flirted with anyone for a long time, I think most of flirting is about:

    * Showing personal interest and enthusiasm for conversation
    * Physical cues and bodyspace
    * Tone
    * Attempts at connection

    These things can be a bit difficult to capture in text, but for the most part, can be done outside of dialogue itself.

    An example:

    > "Where are you from?" he asked. He put a bit of a smile into it, like they were sharing a joke.

    > "Nebraska," she replied. She looked away from him and touched the rim of her glass.

    > "Corn country, right?" he asked.

    > She looked over at him, finally meeting his eyes. "Right," she said. She raised an eyebrow. "Are you ... into corn?"

    > He gave a well-practiced laugh, then smiled at her, letting it reach his eyes. "If you really wanted, we could talk about corn," he said. "I was just trying to make conversation."

    > She looked him over, finally paying attention to him. "And you?" she asked. "Where are you from?"

    > "Take a guess," he said with a grin. "If you get it in the first three, the next drink is on me."

    > "Ah," she said. She was meeting his eyes now, with her gaze occasionally roaming his face. "And if I don't get it? What's my punishment?"

    (Obviously a quickly dashed off example.)

      Thanks! I think this was actually pretty helpful.

    Flirtation is about slowly moving closer to common knowledge of mutual interest while maintaining plausible deniability almost all along the way.  https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=2410

- u/VilhalmFeidhlim:
  ```
  Thought I started strong by getting a good 4k words under my belt on the first day, but coming back to it today feels significantly more difficult. I think the key to making it through will be pacing myself rather than trying to write as much as possible.

  As a side note - setting up a typical hero's journey (even in order to eventually subvert it) is surprisingly difficult. There are a lot of moving parts that need to be finagled very early on, and I'm worried I've missed out some key elements in the interests of writing more.

  Well, Nano is for getting first drafts down. If I actually complete it I'll probably go back and edit.

  Working hard at this this year!  Put my serial on semi hiatus to make darn sure I have something to show for it at the end of the month!  Gogo me!  Write Write Write!
  ```

- u/Sailor_Vulcan:
  ```
  I'm still working on the same story as last november! It's coming along quite nicely, but it's taking a while and I'm a bit concerned that it won't be done before the end of next year. I'm trying not to think about that because the time pressure will stress me out. Still enjoying writing it a lot.
