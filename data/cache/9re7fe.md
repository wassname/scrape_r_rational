  Just started this project. LITRPG is a genre with a lot of potential, but seems to often either stray from its game-like roots or just devolve into normal fantasy. 

  Criticism very welcome.

    Why does it say "In 50 years" and then happen immediately?
    Surgeries stopped working? What does that mean? Do human bodies work radically different?
    Why would the "Council of Control" destroy the world, and then say 50 years? Why would they destroy the world and than bring up "Unless milestones"?

    36 days destroyed everything, but it began with wireless stuff, moved to all electronics, earthquakes, volcanos, tsunamis, rivers, sinkholes, hurricanes. Hour and a half of destroying electronics, followed by 36 days straight of natural disasters means everyone should just be dead.

    The story seems to assume the main character has a bunch of future knowledge, but just flat out ignores some things.

    It might be better to have the whole thing start from the moment wifi cuts out, and then progress through the next "few" (5) weeks of near constant almost death, so we are not just handed a shit ton of infor in a disorganized manner.



    All that being said, this feels like a rough draft. I feel like I am being needlessly antagonistic, but actually writing and putting out stuff is important, and a very good start.

      It hasn't. The merging/transfer is separate from the recreation.

      >  Do human bodies work radically different

      Yes.

      > Why would they destroy the world and than bring up "Unless milestones"

      They're not destroying, they're trimming. Milestones are spoiler material.

      > Followed by 36 days straight of natural disasters means everyone should just be dead.

      The natural disasters ended the moment the recreation was complete. They basically hit the "reset" button.

      > It might be better to have the whole thing start from the moment wifi cuts out

      I debated it. I've never written anything substantial before in my life so I wasn't sure what would be best.

      And yes, it absolutely is a rough draft. Don't worry about being antagonistic, It's probably good for my story in the long run, and I have thick skin.

      Thanks for reading and commenting, it helps a lot.

        Props to you for trying, and putting yourself out there. Since this is the first substantial thing you've ever written you know that you will make plenty of mistakes.

        Being able to acknowledge them, and then learn and improve upon it is an essential skill.

        Having a thick skin and not letting criticism hurt you is also very important and a great trait to have. You will enconter well meaning people, assholes who just want to rag on you and everything in between. I honestly don't have the mindset that is neccesary for that. Good luck!

          Thank you. Best way to learn a language is to just throw yourself into it, so I'm hoping writing is the same.

    Okay, basically, what you have here is a solid sketch of a story, but you do far too much telling and not enough showing... although that changed at the end of the story, so it could just be that you want to skip the boring, expository intro part.

    Aside from the show/tell balance, I'm confused about:
    1) The timeline? Tech got turned off, then nature revolted, then... three hours passed and the screens popped up? What happened in that time?
    1a) Would you maybe have tested things like guns in that time?

    2) "We were walking west". Who's "we"? Where'd they go? What was going on that MC started injured?

    In terms of show/tell - 

    1) Your first chapter is a voice-over exposition. This is fine! Star Wars did it. Rewrite, leaning into that; don't present it as the start to the story, present it as the expository prologue.

    2) Look at how Worth the Candle does thinking-flashbacks for a better way to handle things like Oswald.

    Finally.... I don't think you're ever going to have a FULLY believable story that starts with that kind of apocalypse. You'd have to surpass *Worm* in the dishing out and narrative handling of trauma, and aside from whether that's possible for any writer, and aside from if it's possible for _you_.... would you even *want* to write or read that story? (Others with that kind of terrible: Gantz, Berserk)

    And, sure, maybe the MC and the people in their area are not only no so hard hit, but also the sort that can handle this crap better than the average joe, but still... The still means everyone *else* is fucked, and that's going to have to show up.

    (Also, that kind of devastation doesn't "stop" after a few minutes. The kind of particulate thrown into the air by a mountain formation will persist for millennia, the flooding from water motion will last for days.... Now, you can hand-wave it as part of rebuild weirdness, but people will notice and remark on it and at some point investigate).

    I'd say you have options.
    1) Accept that you're not going to have that much realism
    2) Alter your apocalypse.

    Maybe everything broke, but miraculously, no-one died. Then all the trauma is man-against-man, and the monsters. Still get super dark super fast, but maybe only in urban centers (drastic food and water shortages). 

    Take a page from Singularity Sky: all 1/N of the population disappears and also no-one (or very few) die; then later, something like there's now N earths in a stable orbit. Maybe everyone got moved, witnessed the devastation, and then got put more-or-less back.

    You could also take a page from The Gamer (and sort of the Magineer): there's an additional effect (Gamer's Mind, the AI + built-in drugs) that emotionally stabilizes people so that they're not freaking the fuck out. But then you have to deal with the consequences of *that*.

    Blah blah, now that I've written that, I think you have an amazing way out: Don't mention it. Something happened. Only relate what the MC experienced, and they can guess about the rest, but you don't need answers. Not yet. Fundamentally, the MC doesn't know what happened - they _can't_ - and so we, the reader, don't need to know either.

    Tech shut off, the earth bucked like crazy sauce, then an aggressive stillness descended and then....

      > Okay, basically, what you have here is a solid sketch of a story, but you do far too much telling and not enough showing

      This is sort of intentional. It's early in the story, and is also a character trait. If it keeps hampering the story later on I'll try to change it, but i think things will even out in the next 10-15 chapters.

      > Finally.... I don't think you're ever going to have a FULLY believable story that starts with that kind of apocalypse. 

      Yep, i agree. Another person had a similar comment and i agreed to do rational-adjacent instead of full on rational. It would be too hard for me to do full rational, i think. As well as maybe alienating the LitRPG readers.

      > Now, you can hand-wave it as part of rebuild weirdness, but people will notice and remark on it and at some point investigate).

      They will. I plan for it be a central part of the story.

      > You could also take a page from The Gamer (and sort of the Magineer): there's an additional effect (Gamer's Mind, the AI + built-in drugs) that emotionally stabilizes people so that they're not freaking the fuck out. But then you have to deal with the consequences of that.

      That was the plan. I haven't read the gamer, I'm a little bit mad my idea wasn't as original as i thought.

      Once again, you're right on the mark. I am going to do this. Confusion is only natural, if you have no questions I am doing something wrong. The rational part of my story should be in the satisfying consequences and conclusions to these questions.

      Thanks for commenting, I hope to see you around.

        Fosho. I'm happy you're asking for all the criticism.

        I'm also liking where you're going so far, and the way you're improving as you get to the parts you're (I'm presuming) interested in telling.

    That happens because they keep going far longer than they should with the same character.

    &#x200B;

    Either you finish the story after a certain point or you change the MC, most stories can't be stretched too far before qualify starts to decrease.

    &#x200B;

    Book authors can keep a book series going for many, many volumes, in fact they'd make more money if they did. But money and popularity aren't the only things they are after..

    \*edit more does not equal better..

      I'll keep that in mind.

  The Vorkosigan comparison felt weird, maybe partly because Miles isn't the sort of person to ask "what would X do?"

  - u/Kaiern9:
    ```
    On second glance i agree, it reads awkwardly. I'll see if i can write something that fits better.

    Also, the saga was my favorite series when i was like twelve-ish? That's 7 years ago so I've probably forgotten more than i wish i have. Might be time to both re-read and catch up on the newer ones. Hope it's as good as i remember.
    ```

- u/causalchain:
  ```
  Reading it through, especially the first chapter, didn't *feel* like what I expected from a rational fic: I think this is a fact about writing style and choice of description (like lots of telling not showing). On the other hand, once you get further into the story and I get used to your style, it'll probably click better. Right now, it feels strongly rational-adjacent, still the kind of thing we will all enjoy.

  My thoughts:

  * Is the "selected to join the multiverse" idea fleshed out? Similar ideas are common in apocalypse litrpgs, but my gripe is that they don't have a coherent reason why everything works the way it does: Why/How does technology stop working? Why does the planet throw a hissy fit and why is it gradual? Why Ghouls and Bloodbats? 
     * What are the motives of the multiverse in including a new member and why does that include culling the population?
        * culling is generally to select for preferable traits (unless thanos); what are they selecting for?

  Although I mentioned style, I think that if you want to change the writing style, it'd be better to do later/in a rewrite and not worry about it now. Narrative devices don't matter as much as substance (but if you get back to it later, it'd be cool!)
