  I've got a ton of responses on that thread, but going by the handy checklist:

  > The characters are not stupid. No one holds the Idiot Ball (or at least not the main heroes or main villains).

  This is a work with loads and loads of characters in it, and so it depends on who you consider the main characters. It's not really so much a problem of holding the Idiot Ball as it is that some people act in the stupid ways that people sometimes act in real life. There are also a few real boneheaded moves by a few of the players.

  > The characters solve problems through the intelligent application of their knowledge and resources.

  Again, it sort of depends on the characters. Tyrion is the resident master of this, while Cersei is basically just insane and Sansa has no real agency.

  > The story is like a puzzle; readers can reach the same solution as the characters by using the information provided earlier in the story.

  Sometimes. See below, but the magic systems make this a bit hard, because the reader is often kept in the dark about how those things actually work. There have been a few times when solutions to problems were presented which didn't really seem to have any groundwork laid for them - they still worked in story for me, but they weren't the sort of thing you could possibly predict.

  > Factions are defined and driven into conflict by their beliefs and values, not just by being "good" or "evil".

  I'd definitely check this one off. Some care about their immediate family, some care about personal power, some care about the good of the realm, and others just want to rule over the ashes.

  > The rules of the fictional world are sane and consistent.

  Nope. There are maybe eight or nine systems of magic (warging, warlocks, greenseeing, shadow binding, white walkers, faceless men, dragons, etc.) and none of them are really explained at all. And this is by intent - [Martin wants magic to be strange, dangerous, and beyond human comprehension.](http://www.vulture.com/2011/10/george_rr_martin_on_his_favori.html) I think it works for the story, but it doesn't hit that bullet point.

  And with maybe the exception of Sam, we don't really hit any of the bullet points, and I don't really expect that we will in future books, because GRRM's interviews have indicated that this isn't the sort of story that he wants to tell.

  Any time sex is involved, rational behavior seems to go out the window.  Half the time it just seems like an excuse to get out the Idiot Ball.
