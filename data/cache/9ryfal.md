## Has yudkowsky written recently/what has he released that isn't on his site?

### Post:

So I don't think the fiction section of yudkowsky website has updated in a year or so, but I am aware he has released works not listed there.

I would love a list of such works, or directions to anything he might have released in the last year or two.

To anyone who was interested enough to click on this, and who might also be looking for new reading material, shewhoguards on fanfiction writes phenomenal stuff.

  I don't know what Yudowsky has been doing lately, which is somewhat saddening. I'd love to read more work by him, would buy any novels he wrote, etc. I'd be grateful if he even wrote up a "fantasy I've recently enjoyed, things I'm currently reading" - blogpost every so often. He's got a superior degree of reading taste.

    I'm quite certain this is Yudkowsky's [twitter](https://twitter.com/ESYudkowsky)! If he has anything he's currently working on, I believe you may find out here. 

    Edit: At the same time it seems to mainly be in regards to his work in Artificial Intelligence rather than his written works, although I suppose you could always test your luck.
