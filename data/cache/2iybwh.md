  I keep on trying to get you guys into dawnSomewhere, and it keeps not happening.

  But he mentions HPMOR in this one, so yay.

  I recommend the [mechwarrior series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNC_sRuPtMonAOP46gqW9Q6E4ESFmum6d) on the same channel. Politics, economics, giant robots, guerrilla warfare, and military tactics.

  This is mostly just him rambling on about all the lovecraft tropes, fair warning.

    I watch some of the series from this content creator, although I was already into it before you posted the mechwarrior video.

    But hey, now you know at least two people in this subreddit watch Dawn Somewhere, so that's nice.

  Ooh, Lovecraft! I'd love to watch this whole video, but it's half an hour long and he seems to ramble a little bit. He repeats himself a lot, and the "but"s and "yeah" in this video are off the charts. Maybe a script would help him get to the point more quickly.

  On that note, what story should I read as an introduction to the mythos?

    Couldn't say, he has a few suggestion in the video, but they've slipped my mind.

    Consistently outputting content is important, and I think that's he idea behind the personal times. Quick low-production-cost video's. He seems to be trying to do things across a range of production values, to see what sticks.

    But yeah, I honestly don't expect this to be very appealing to most of the people here. I generally watch them in the background, while I'm doing something else.

    Added a disclaimer to my root-level comment.

  This is half an hour of a guy talking. I have to know what it is and what it is about before investing that amount of time. As far as I know it could just be a guy rambling on for half an hour trying to rationally deconstruct Lovecraftian horror stories or something.
