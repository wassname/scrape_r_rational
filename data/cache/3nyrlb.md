## [BST] suppose you had to become a costumed crimefighter, using only your current resources. How would you do it?

  Join the police academy. Graduate. Get a job as a police officer. Take the uniform. Quit the job. Now since I am no longer a police officer, the uniform qualifies as a costume. Fight crime. Get arrested for impersonating a police officer, stealing a uniform and vigilanteeism. 

  Wait, did you want us to be effective at fighting crime as well?

    Genius!

  My current job (cybersecurity) arguably already involves fighting crime, so I guess I'd just start wearing silly clothes to work.

  Start a microinvestment firm in a third-world country with a very unusual office dress code.

  I'm going to play this according to the spirit of the question, rather than the letter of it. No "fighting crime" by donating time and money to drug rehabilitation, as effective as that might be.

  My current resources.

  - A couple of years of martial arts training, ongoing.
  - A few grand in the bank.
  - A relative who knows a lot about the town I live in. (she basically knows everyone)

  My detriments:

  - I can't drive.
  - I only have about average levels of fitness.

  So, what would I do?

  Several steps need to be taken. One is to get a LOT more serious about my working out program, and martial arts. There's an MMA place in my town; I'll start looking into that. Another is to get a PO box and a storage unit, so nobody can stumble across my stuff.

  I live in a small town in Australia, so the odds that a criminal is going to have a gun is probably not high. Even so, I'd want a bullet proof vest, something to do what I can against knives, and a strong full-faced helmet. I should have the money to order all of these. (though I couldn't afford anything super-advanced for the second one.)

  In the meantime, I start subtly pumping my relative for information about the bad neighborhoods and such. Where would it be least safe for me to travel after dark? That's where I'd need to go. 

  Other requirements would be pepper spray, some sort of non-lethal weapon like a baton or something, and a smartphone so I can use the internet to navigate. I'd need to use my bike to navigate near the areas that I'd be patrolling, but I'd patrol on foot.

  Lastly, start studying the law, and other costumed crime-fighters to see what they do. They exist in real life, even though they're uncommon. I need to know what I can and can't do in my country and state. Can I record people without their consent? Things like that.

  For the actual crime-fighting, given I live in a small town, drug dealers are likely the worst I'd have to deal with. My greatest danger is running into a dealer enough times that they decide to get some friends and beat the crap out of me via ambush. If I've got weapons and armor, I assume a drug dealer is pretty unlikely to be willing to stand and fight alone. So assuming I don't have a minimum quota to meet, I'd want to patrol infrequently enough that it's not worth keeping a posse on standby for weeks on the off chance that I might show up one night. 

  The ideal situation would be to create or join up with a group, since there's safety in numbers, but I don't know if anyone else is crazy enough to do it. Besides, every person I tell means someone who can make the connection, and if something goes wrong and I end up on the news, they might just decide to tell the police who I am.

  Loudly.

  "Costumed crimefighter here, criminals better beware! Better run away quick! La la la!"

  Also I'd carry a gun.

  ```
  Put on a weird suit and donate to the charity that pays drug addicts to get sterilised. Thanks to my powers of superior low time preference and agency, this satisfies the "crime fighting" value more than various short term solutions.
