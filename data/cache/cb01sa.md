## [MK] You are Cassandra. How do you abuse your curse?

### Post:

(inspired by [Rational use of an unbreakable object?](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/caeyqv/rational_use_of_an_unbreakable_object/))

Rules:

  * You can prophesy (unconditional) events in the future.
  * Any action taken to reveal these prophecies to others will result in them assigning a probability of 0 to that which the prophecy describes (yes, I do mean a probability of 0! Axiomic certainty) until the events transpire.
  * Once you are aware of one of your prophesies, it _will_ come to pass.

I can't think of any ways to abuse this, [other than the obvious "bet on stuff"](https://www.qwantz.com/index.php?comic=2944). However, it's such an overpowered ability that such must exist.

### Comments:

- u/Silver_Swift:
  ```
  You can use this as an assassination tool: 

  1.  Predict whether someone will be alive and in excruciating mind numbing pain for the rest of their lives starting tomorrow and presumably see that they are going to be fine.
  - Tell them that they are not going to be in excruciating mind numbing pain for the rest of their lives starting tomorrow and explain that the only way to avert this fate is to kill themselves before the prophecy takes place.
  - Profit?
  ```

  - u/wizzwizz4:
    ```
    That's… out of the box thinking. My ethical qualms would stop me even seeing that as a possibility. Though it might be more effective if you phrase it as "conditional on you not killing yourself tomorrow"… though which part would they— this is hard.

    Edit: That wouldn't work, anyway, since it's not prophesising the future. Your way is the only way I can see this working.
    ```

    - u/Silver_Swift:

        - u/Silver_Swift:

          That's fair, yes. If you don't have control over what your visions are about this ability becomes a lot less useful.

            If she had taken the oracle seriously she *might* have been able to do something by planning for the catastrophe herself and otherwise keeping her mouth shut.

            The failing of Cassandra is the failing of so many people who really *know* things, but can't keep their mouths shut even when they know people won't want to hear what they have to say.

      But she did prophecy the future. She looked, and found they would not be in pain. She then told them, "Your future shows you not in pain" which forces them to believe that their future shows them IN pain. Anything she says after that is just trolling.

      - u/wizzwizz4:

        Or, maybe, she looked into the future and saw them dead – i.e. not in pain.

  The actual way Cassandra's curse works, is that she can foretell the future accurately, but it cannot benefit anyone else because no one believes a word about her prophecies. Lying about her prophecies falls outside of the scope of the curse and cannot be exploited. Inventing fake prophecies also is out. Also, in most versions she does not control what she sees, nor when she utters her prophecies, so timing cannot be exploited either and there is no way to "aim" for the purpose of predicting specific events' outcome.  


  So, yeah, it is only useful for benefitting herself, only when there's an opportunity to do so presenting itself out of blind luck. But you can trust Apollo won't let her, and might actively undermine any efforts of her to escape her tragic condition.

    Thanks for posting this, I was picturing the prophecies themselves "appearing" rather than you being able to concentrate on what you want to see, so it was really disappointing to see everyone saying "predict whether your friend is in pain" / "constantly predict the stockmarket"! Ditto with people saying they should just give fake predictions and then people will believe the opposite: you're not blessed with people never believing you, you're cursed with people not believing your *real prophecies*.

  - u/hikahia:
    ```
    Man, I like this idea, but I can't figure out a way to make it work:

    Cassandra: I predict that you wont believe any of my predictions!  

    Victim: No, I'll believe you! Really!

    Cassandra: The king will die tomorrow

    Victim: Nope, don't believe you

    Cassandra: So my first prediction was right!

    Victim: Nope, I'm still gonna believe your other predictions

    Cassandra: But you don't believe me now

    Victim: Nope.

    Cassandra: Okay, the queen will die the day after the king.

    Victim: Yeah, I don't believe that either!

    Cassandra: See! My first prediction was right!

    Victim: Nah, I still haven't heard all of your predictions yet. I'm sure I'll believe the rest of them!


    Repeat to infinity :(

    It seems to me as long as the belief is forced, then acceptance of the belief must also be forced. If the belief conflicts, you just shrug it off because your acceptance of the belief is forced too.

  Easy as pie, surely. 

  * To get some initial capital, be boring and play the stock market with your future prediction powers. Short stocks that will fall, buy stocks that will raise, make cash, keep quiet about your powers.

  * After you have some arbitrary amount of initial money, start up a consulting firm with a fancy name (this will be relevant later). All it absolutely needs to have is a fancy-looking website where you can publicise predictions and be a legal explanation for what you do so people don't look too closely at you. Everything else is optional. Consulting firm making accurate predictions makes sense, some random nobody is a bit more suspicious.

  * Hire a small bunch of actual normal economists and what have you to work in your firm - better front & backup income flow if your powers cut out suddenly. Pro tip: hire the guy writing this post and tell them about your powers.

  * Publicize a couple predictions about e.g. future worldwide elections, economic events, football game wins etc, then spread them online with a combination of moderate clickbait writing (buy out a yellow pages magazine to write clickbait articles for you if you don't want clickbait on your fancy conservative-looking consulting website) and old - fashioned marketing.

  * After you get some name recognition, you can make even MORE money on the stock market by publicising your predictions. E.g. say you predict company's stock will raise. Then you publicise that prediciton and short the stock as soon as investors start to sell it (after all, anyone that read your article assigns probability 0 to it raising), making a butload of cash. Then, once the price hits the lowest point, you buy up all that stock and wait until it goes back up, somehow, even though 100% of the investors sold out(after all, your predictions always come to pass). When it does, you sell the stock again, and get a second butload of money. Rinse & repeat.

  After a while, people will see that: 

  * Your firm has a 100% track record of predicting future events. (If you are trying to avoid suspicion, sprinkle in some posts where you predict the future with good old-fashioned guessing, without using magic, to bring the accuracy percentage down a bit. Alternatively, just use your normal non-supernatural analysts to do their job and that'd also bring the accuracy down)

  * Some events you have tried to predict were seen as very unlikely by the worldwide community at the time (everyone that looked up your blog before the event happened will assign the probability 0, right, so the more clicks you generate the lower the belief of the worldwide community will be in that prediction, and you can generate A LOT of clicks with all that stock money)

  * On the most ridiculous predictions with the least amount of public information, you have the highest accuracy of anyone on the planet.

  Now, this is the best part. Obviously noone will think you have the curse. They'd just see you being somehow ridiculously accurate. If you try to make a new supernatural prediction they will (naturally, since the curse) think it is all nonsense, but you don't have to do that. Whatever you say is now going to be paid a whole lot of attention to, even if you are completely making it up - after all, everyone sees that you are (somehow) very accurate, and noone can guess how you do it (Not even IRS! Prophecies do not count as insider knowledge, and all your business is legal). Basically, you don't actually need to use your power to affect people.

  At this point you can do a lot of things. Hire yourself out as election consultant, perhaps, and shape their policy decisions by blatantly relying on your magically-earned reputation. Keep using your power on other things, though, to keep up your prediction accuracy.

  I know it wouldn't be the most epic, broken, or efficient thing to do with the power but I think it would be interesting to be a reporter. 

  1. You would see the future and gather information on a story before anyone else.
  2. You could then publish it immediately after it happens, because it isn't a future event anymore
  3. \-Maybe- you could still influence how the future action happens, by purposefully telling someone about it. Like, if some tragedy is about to happen perhaps you could tell a friend about it and it could change. I'm not sure how this part works, hence the -maybe- in the front.

  Really the main advantage you would have is your visions giving you the scoop on every news story possible.

    It depends how specific your prophesy is. You can't stop it from happening; Cassandra never did.

    - u/thrasherfect92:
      ```
      Okay well, you'd still be the reporter that is always on the scene with the story and information already prepared before any of the others even know about it. Even if you can't change them you would still be able to give the people the information about the event as/after it happens.

  Predict whether or not it is true that for literally everyone in every situation, doing whatever you say is the best possible decision. When this predictably returns false, you can use this to make anyone do whatever you want.

  Err, what happens if you prophesy something obvious and tell someone? For example, you could prophesy a sunset, and then tell someone "the sun will set in the west tomorrow". Will that actually make them assign a probability of 0 to the sun setting in the west tomorrow, even though it is obviously true?

  For that matter, if you prophesy just about anything, that proves that the world still exists in the future. So if you tell someone that the world still exists in the future, do they now believe the world is going to end? 

  Because holy hell that makes you a psychological weapon of mass destruction. Prophesy anything, then go on television and tell the public that the world still exists in the future. They now assign a probability of 0 to that, so everyone starts acting like the world is ending and entire societies will fall into total anarchy.

  - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
    ```
    > Will that actually make them assign a probability of 0 to the sun setting in the west tomorrow, even though it is obviously true?

    I wonder, because Cassandra's curse was specific to her *prophecies*. You could classify a prophecy as "future knowledge that could not have been obtained any other way", which would avoid this ridiculous exploit.
    ```

    - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
      ```
      Technically, you can't know that the world will still exist tomorrow in any way other than living until tomorrow.

      After all, you can't know whether a true vacuum has formed somewhere in space, and is now destroying the world in all directions at the speed of light.

      So if anything, it's actually infinitely easier for you to obtain information about a volcano erupting tomorrow (under the assumption that the world still exists) than for you to obtain information about the continued existence of world. (Substitute "Earth" for "world" if "world" isn't well-defined.)
      ```

      - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
        ```
        Right, so if Cassandra says "tomorrow the world will still exist" without looking she's not using her 100% infallible gift of prophecy, she's just making an inference like us ordinary humans, so *that* should be believed. The curse should only apply to things she assigns a probability of 1 to, because prophecy.
        ```

        - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
          ```
          If she says  "tomorrow the world will still exist" without looking then sure, that wouldn't trigger any magical effects.

          But if she says  "tomorrow the world will still exist" *with looking*, i.e., because she actually prophesied an event occurring tomorrow, that means she assigned a probability of 1 to the existence of the world tomorrow *because* of a prophecy, and so the magical effect should trigger and cause people to assign a probability of 0 to the existence of the world tomorrow.

          This should work because the existence of the world tomorrow isn't 100% certain. It is incredibly likely that the world still exists tomorrow, but nothing is absolutely certain. Only prophesy can let you actually assign a probability of 1 to events.
          ```

  - u/wizzwizz4:

    > Will that actually make them assign a probability of 0 to the sun setting in the west tomorrow, even though it is obviously true?

    Yes.

    > For that matter, if you prophesy just about anything, that proves that the world still exists in the future. So if you tell someone that the world still exists in the future, do they now believe the world is going to end?

    If that's specifically what you prophesied? Yes. You'd probably get more details, though, like _when_ the world would still exist.

    > Prophesy anything, then go on television and tell the public that the world still exists in the future.

    Wouldn't work, unless you're prophesying that the world will still exist in the future _specifically_. Giving knowledge of the framework under which the prophesy must be valid is conveying zero information about the prophesy.
    ```

    - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
      ```
      > Wouldn't work, unless you're prophesying that the world will still exist in the future *specifically* 

      Okay, so can you tell people that the world will still exist on the date of your prophetic vision, and that will make them think the world will end on or before that date? That still lets you be a psychological weapon of mass destruction then, you just need to only go on television when there's only a short time left before one of your prophesied events.
      ```

      - u/wizzwizz4:
        ```
        I think that would probably work, yes. Though the hysteria would only be short-lived, since once the event has occurred everybody will go back to normal.

        - u/Silver_Swift:
          ```
          > once the event has occurred everybody will go back to normal.

          Actually, that is an interesting problem with this version of Cassandras curse. 

          If they literally assigned probability 0 to the event having occurred they would not go back to normal, because you can never update away from having assigned a probability of 0. 

          (Any evidence you would receive that something with probability 0 happened has a non-zero chance that you are misinterpreting or imagining it, so you would update in the direction of disbelieving the evidence rather than believing the prophecy)
          ```

          - u/wizzwizz4:
            ```
            You can never _naturally_ update away from having assigned a probability of zero. If there was a circuit in your head that returned "0" when the probability was queried, but still updated normally, then the circuit was removed…
            ```

- u/TheRealEndfall:
  ```
  Well, first we have to figure out what we have. 

  Suppose that I run a prediction on the value of gold, with the precommittment to inform the public of what I see. There are three possibilities: Gold is not significantly different, gold is significantly lower, gold is siginificantly higher. My precommitted reveal will use unified language. If I see gold as literally valuless, I'll say that the price of gold will not have decreased by 99% tomorrow. Otherwise, I'll swap 99% for 100%. This way, I'm revealing my knowledge of the future.

  Given that people now believe, regardless of the truth, that the value of gold is going to fall through the floor, a selling frenzy should occur. As they see the prices drop, news will spread, and the selling frenzy will become more intense. Now - either I'll have seen gold drop to nil, or I won't have. But if I haven't, then I've created a condition where the restoration of gold's price will require an event of supreme improbability. We know the event has to occur per samsara.

  ...If I always see the value of gold as low/zero, this means that this ability accounts for my decisions. If it accounts for my decisions, then I can cultivate predictions that create some desired end state. Beyond that, it means that the entire set of all outcomes - past, present, and future - is predetermined, which is far too boring, so I game the ability by killing myself to either the boredom or satisfaction of the ability-giver. It doesn't matter, because nothing does! Samsara!

  On the other had, if we don't constantly see low/zero value, then that's suggestive that the ability does not take into account the user's choices, but actively manipulates developing events to enforce outcomes. That (probably) being the case, I'd like to see what would happen if I tell Vladimir Putin that the US will not launch a preemptive nuclear attack on Russia after first predicting that it won't and even before that prediction, predicting that the US will remain un-nuked for the next *n* years and that relations with russia will continue as normal, or something similarly ridiculous, but less genocidetastic. You know, really make the power *work* for whatever contrived bullshit it gives me.

  In the meantime, I'll set up a timestamped random character generator and predict timestamps to read a total syntheses for the most powerful lifesaving drugs that will ever be invented, and other useful knowledge.

- u/TrebarTilonai:

  I would argue that it is not exploitable. Generally speaking, Greek prophecies tend to not be things that you can control; you can't choose to have a prophecy about a given event or situation so there would be no way to game the system that way by choosing what to prophecy about. Secondly, said prophecies are in stable time loops; there is no action that you can take to cause them to happen or not to happen. In fact, in many Greek stories an attempt to avert a prophecy directly causes it to come to pass. The curse of the prophecy is that nobody will believe you when you prophecy; it doesn't mean that they are immediately going to do the opposite of whatever you tell them. It just means that they're going to look at you like a homeless guy on the street muttering about the alien voices in his head.  


  Finally, even if you managed to find some way to exploit it, Cassandra's curse was given by (and monitored by) a literal God who would be able to quickly patch out any exploits. It is a punishment for not fulfilling a commitment to sex with Apollo, not a way to munchkin into ultimate power.

  >Once you are aware of one of your prophesies, it *will* come to pass.

  So it's inevitable? Time to outcome pump like crazy.

  If you can prophesy anything at all about yourself, like say you prophesy that you do some action X in 10 years, that means you cannot die before then. So go absolutely nuts and pre-commit to killing yourself unless your desired outcomes happen, and the universe will bend to your will to ensure you survive until 10 years later.

  If you can only prophesy things about other people, then that's harder. You need to find some way to kill them in order to outcome pump, but then the pump works much harder against you since it could simply kill you to prevent you from killing the other. On the other hand, the fact that this other person survives until the moment of your prophesy suggests that wherever he goes, the area he is in is relatively safer than normal, so you could abuse this simply by sticking to him like glue.

  Something I notice is that as long as you have the credibility, and you don't tell them why you want them to do stuff, you can get them to act on your prophecies.

  Like, you can tell someone, "If you're near a burning tanker, get as far away from it as possible", because that's not revealing future events. If you did manage to run afoul of the cassandra curse, and they think they'll never be near a burning tanker, they'll still remember your advice and be able to act on it.

  I would argue yes, since making everyone ignore her is the proxy for helplessness... but she's not bound to enter a room if she sees herself entering a room.

  &#x200B;

  2 - Can Cassandra believably lie about what she sees?

  I would argue that she probably can. The curse seems targeted toward people not believing her future-speak... but there isn't any clause against fabricated-speak.

  &#x200B;

  3 - Can Cassandra conjure a future she wants?

  I would argue not. She can *see* the future, not *conjure* it. So while some of the comments here are fun, she can't invert gravity by making people think gravity sticking around is implausible.

  &#x200B;

  4 - Can Cassandra see alternative futures?

  I would argue not. She can see the result of any present mix of factors, barring her own involvement (since she's the only one with future-sight). If she changes something, the future she sees shifts accordingly once she's done it.

  &#x200B;

  5 - Are indirect actions given zero believability in addition to direct communication?

  I would argue anything that could reasonably be interpreted more than one way is not discounted. Telling people to build a fence (to stop some wild hounds tomorrow night) "because it looks nice" is fine. If a piano is about to fall on someone, yelling, waving, gesturing, and so on to get them to move are all not believable.

  ==============

  With those out of the way, I think there are a few major avenues for abuse, which I'll define as subverting Apollo's objective of making Cassandra a helpless witness to fate.

  &#x200B;

  1 - Influence Systems That Rely on People's Beliefs

  Market gaming has been mentioned elsewhere, but I'm thinking about tampering with democratic elections. Votes are influenced by people's beliefs, and changing those will affect the outcome. If Cassandra can affect the future she sees, she should be able to declare any future leader she doesn't like will win and then they won't. This would be particularly handy in the world right now given the dictatorial populism that's on the rise.

  &#x200B;

  2 - Become Someone who Distributes Research Grant Money

  She'll be in the unique position of distributing funds where they can best go for society based on how the research turns out in advance.

  &#x200B;

  3 - Achieve any powerful position where she alone has the power of selection

  This could be recruiting, picking stocks, detective work, sales... anything where she has enough authority to make the choice herself *without* having to convince anyone else of it. The most powerful of which (if she can get there) is probably CEO / CFO of a multi-national company. Which one largely depends on her choice of impact on the world, because it could equally be Facebook, Tesla, GE, Sony, or any other.

  &#x200B;

  4 - Accelerate Humanity's Development

  One thing that isn't mentioned is how far into the future Cassandra can see, and how much she can comprehend. As long as her actions are sufficiently ambiguous or nominally false enough, she could peer into future human developments and help alter humanity's course. She could nudge research labs into productive directions by leaving certain items out and arranged in certain orders, steer future Hitlers to art school, and avoid big disasters by prominently broadcasting how safe they are.

  1. Short a company that you predict to encounter external non price related failures, such as legal trouble or accidents.

  2. This reveals to market participants that you believe the company's stock will go down.

    2.1. The market participants disbelieve.

  3. The company's stock goes up. Short it more.

  4. Then severely goes down as the bad event happens.

  5. Literally profit.

  I feel like a number of people are going about this wrong. It'll probably be much less abusable than it's being portrayed (note: still eminently abusable).

  Any prophecies we see have to come true, thus they will take into account our actions after seeing them. Thus, all prophecies must be able to come into play even with our actions. Aka they may be different from what was going to happen by the nature of our using our power via observer effect.

  Ex: the stock X was going to stay steady tomorrow. We use our power. The power takes into account how we will act on the prophecy. Tomorrow now holds a drop in the stock X, which we see in our prophecy. 

  Regardless of what we do, the new future is now a drop in stock X. Maybe it's because we tell people and they panic sell, leading to our buying it at the peak low tomorrow following the drop - but the stock price is locked in to fall.

  The simplest way a prophecy will come true could always be the person with the power has a heart attack and dies immediately after the prophecy is given, since if the person was free to act they would do something to irrevocably nullify it. If anything, one should be super cautious with this power if the universe HAS to make prophecies come true, because the only variable is the one with the power. It may just be easiest for the universe to "smite" them whenever they use it.

  Easy character assassination: Predict obvious things to target, target repeatedly believes things that are seemingly irrational. Example: "The next NASA mission will not prove that the earth is flat" will turn anyone into a flat-earther.

  Alternatively, start a cult by predicting that those who do not join your cult will not be cast down into the fiery depths of Hell for all eternity. More general applications of this up to and including world domination are left as an exercise for the reader.

  Easy actual assassination: "If you kill yourself in the next hour, you will not be miraculously resurrected and lead humankind into a golden age of peace and prosperity". Or whatever incentives will work for your target.

  More generally, you can predict that people won't get <highly desirable outcome> if they do <thing you want them to do>; this is almost certainly true (and thus predictable) and will lead to them doing <thing> motivated by <outcome>. This is a simple way to compel arbitrary behaviour from arbitrary people if worded correctly. As in the cult example, negative outcome avoidance can also be used instead.

  Hmm. On second thought I'm not sure if conditionals like that are permitted, but wording along the lines of "Anyone fulfilling <conditions specific to target> who performs <thing you want target to do> will not receive <highly desirable outcome>" should get around this; it's a simple future statement rather than an if/then thing.

  Assuming I'm reading the conditions correctly; if you can prophesy any event and not just events that are actually going to happen, then you have arbitrary future control powers and can simply warp reality at will (e.g. predict you'll become omnipotent in the next second). I'm assuming this isn't how that works.

  On a related note, I am curious as to how this scenario handles, for example, telling someone the venture that they are planning will succeed. It seems like to satisfy all the conditions, the person you tell has to be axiomatically certain the venture will fail but attempt it anyway. How does their mind reconcile this?

  A sufficiently evil person could probably doom the world by writing articles about climate change and participating in major environmentalist events.

  The simple idea would be that you choose to reveal the future only to your enemies, so as to hurt them.  


  "Apple and Google stocks will rise". Your enemies will now be disbelieving this, even though it will be true.
