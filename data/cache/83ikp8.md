  As near as I can tell, this seems to be some kind of metafictional entity that manifests inside fictional stories and then somehow nullifies said stories' existence, causing them to disappear from their "parent" world (the world which produced the stories in the first place). Also, apparently this thing is capable of, not only nullifying the stories *themselves*, but also stories *within* stories, as well as stories within stories within stories, and so on. So it's essentially munching its way up a nested tower of fictional narratives, and the payoff is that because the *SCP universe* is actually fictional, that suggests that they're also going to be erased--after which, of course, we're next in line.

  If I'm right, then this is a pretty neat concept, but the horror relies pretty heavily on a couple of metaphysical assumptions that I don't share (such as, for example, the assumption that we live in a fictional universe). As such, I can appreciate this as a *concept*, but not really as *horror*.

    Close. It postulates a particular self-destructing narrative: a set of characters and plot points that, if featured in a fictional work, destroys itself and the fictional work in question, erasing it from memories and reality. Appendix A provides clues regarding the nature of this narrative: it features a person or a group of people trying to reach or comprehend something black/evil/destructive, and failing despite expending great effort; sometimes featuring number seven.

    The Foundation has been trying to map out fiction-space (by procedurally generating stories and descriptions of these stories, then checking whether there are any descriptions that don't correspond to any story) to figure out exact properties of this narrative, because it's an existential threat to their world (what if it plays out in reality?). ...And then it turns out results of their research are, [DATA LOST].

    They have been unwittingly making this narrative play out in reality, being a group of people trying to comprehend a narrative-destroyer.

    > If I'm right, then this is a pretty neat concept, but the horror relies pretty heavily on a couple of metaphysical assumptions that I don't share (such as, for example, the assumption that we live in a fictional universe)

    It doesn't necessarily. Nothing says the narrative *has* to be fictional. We're observing its influence only on fictional narratives because there's more stories than realities, but it may very well work on real-world narratives (people and sequences of events) as well.
    ```

    - u/FaceDeer:
      ```
      Neat. Another way in which SCP-2747 itself fits the narrative pattern of the instances it describes: Appendix A has descriptions of seven instances.

      Edit: And of course there are two "7"s in the SCP's number.
      ```

    - u/Psy-Kosh:
      ```
      I think one of the themes they were going for in the anafabula is not just failing, but ambiguity about whether or not they failed, or whether it was possible to succeed.
      ```

    - u/SoylentRox:
      ```
      Can I ask why SCP is of rational interest?

      It's a universe that is built to _discourage_ rational exploration, _discourage_ trying to develop tech or figure out the underlying principles of the universe that let these devices work, and so on.  

      The correct answer in SCP is "lock all the interesting stuff away and pretend it doesn't exist"
      ```

      - u/Noumero:
        ```
        Because SCP Foundation is an organization whose goals are research and containment of various supernatural entities via mundane means, no matter how powerful or strange they are. There's a lot of overlap between r/rational's interests and the Foundation's:

        * "Special Containment Procedures" are essentially our Munchkinry Threads. We like to come up with interesting ways to defeat dangerous opponents, and the Foundation has to.

        * The objects themselves. We like esoteric and interesting things/entities, as long as they're self-consistent and well-explored. The SCP Wiki incentivizes people to generate original and unique objects, and the Foundation, by necessity or by choice, is a scientific institution; as the result, many good SCPs are both well-researched and novel.

        * The bigger picture. The Foundation indeed exists in a rather hostile universe — how do they deal with it? The Foundation has to do a lot of deontologically evil things to continue operating — and we like moral and philosophical dilemmas.

        Ultimately, the SCP Foundation is a literature project which produces a lot of interesting and unique Sci-Fi or fantasy ideas, puts them under spotlight, and explores in-depth. On top of that, its format and worldbuilding incidentally overlaps with some of r/rational's other interests.

        (At least that's how I see it.)

        >It's a universe that is built to *discourage* rational exploration, *discourage* trying to develop tech or figure out the underlying principles of the universe that let these devices work

        I don't think that's the case. Developing new mundane technology is certainly desirable — containment of a lot of dangerous, homicidal entities would be impossible without it — as is researching SCP objects (not all of them have metaphysical information-based defence/offence abilities, after all). Achieving complete understanding of an SCP... it indeed happens rarely, but I think it's because of the format (SCP authors are disincentivized from giving full explanations), not because of in-universe reasons. There are some explained objects — I think they have a "-EX" tag? **Edit:** [Yep](http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-ex).
        ```

        - u/SoylentRox:
          ```
          Well, when I skimmed SCP articles, the trend I kept seeing was :

          a.  The object is unexplainable
          b.  The object is dangerous
          c.  The object is either unexploitable, or in the rare cases where it's useful, it's usually used for parlor tricks.  Like the box of endless pizza.  Nothing ever provides a solution that scales or the knowledge you would need to make progress towards making objects of your own.
          ```

            ```
            >Nothing ever provides a solution that scales or the knowledge you would need to make progress towards making objects of your own.

            because such objects would not need to be contained as SCPs.  they would just be "technology."
            ```

    - u/RynnisOne:
      ```
      I agree with 69's interpretation, honestly.  I can buy it eating fictional narratives, but not reality.

      If this thing was *any* threat to the Foundation whatsoever, they'd just re-label it with no mentions of "7's", slap a **Cognitohazard Warning** at the front, and **REDACT** everything or lock it behind O-level access.
      ```

  - u/Geminii27:
    ```
    Given the number of fictional universes that have been produced throughout human history, if you pick a universe at random at whatever level of the stack it's overwhelmingly more likely to be fictional than not. And it's extremely rare for the characters in any universe to see their universe as anything other than real.

    Therefore, *statistically*...
    ```

    - u/AStartlingStatement:
      ```
      Nick Bostrom's simulation argument; 

      >- "The fraction of human-level civilizations that reach a posthuman stage (that is, one capable of running high-fidelity ancestor simulations) is very close to zero", **or**

      >- "The fraction of posthuman civilizations that are interested in running ancestor-simulations is very close to zero", **or**

      >- "The fraction of all people with our kind of experiences that are living in a simulation is very close to one"

    ```

    - u/RynnisOne:
      ```
      Sounds like 2747 is already consuming your *personal* fictional perception of reality.  I'd recommend you avoiding any of these "right-wing" or "Trump" sites lest you accelerate the process and disappear altogether.
      ```

  - u/icesharkk:
    ```
    either 2747 is a narrative eating monster created within narrative (Infohazard?) or its a self propagating narrative analysis/artifact generator (memetic). 

    If the first case then it doesn't matter if you believe we are fictional or not it has had an effect on our level of reality by wiping people minds and erasing the actual story from physical media. Don't get considered the container of an offending story or people will only remember that they read an article about someone like you once.

    In the second case people don't remember writing the articles/artifacts because they didn't. The SCP did and seeded those articles/artifacts through some unknown mechanic into our reality in which case the narrative never existed, The reference to LUCID CHALICE is just another artifact, and this SCP is as dangerous as waterlogged bread.

- u/LazarusRises:
  ```
  Brilliant. That last collapsible is so wonderfully simple: *it's getting closer.*

  My question is, why was the Marquez story eaten? It didn't seem to be a metanarrative to me, while all the others certainly were.
  ```

  - u/Noumero:
    ```
    It doesn't have to be meta, it has to feature a certain combination of tropes. Among them: 

    * A "dark" destination:
     * *Punta de la espira*: the possibly-demonic mountain.  
     * *Taitoru*: the shadows/the manga (unclear, maybe its plot was bleak?)  
     * *No Sister of Mine*: the black possibly-cursed tome.  
     * *The Scolipendra Wiki*: the obsidian concept-destroyer.  
     * *I/O*: the theme of self-hate.  
     * *Mavigne*: the cold core of the earth.  
     * *ex lux*: the truth of the murder.  
     * The article itself: SCP-2747's nature.  
    * Great effort going to vain:
     * *Punta de la espira*: the journey to the mountain.
     * *Taitoru*: getting past the writer's block.
     * *No Sister of Mine*: players trying to complete the game.
     * *The Scolipendra Wiki*: characters wandering between universes in search (unclear, possibly they fail?).
     * *I/O*: exploring the depressing theme.
     * *Mavigne*: learning the secrets of the earth.
     * *ex lux*: identifying the murderer. 
     * The article itself: the Foundation failing to figure out SCP-2747's nature ([DATA LOST]).

    * 7 things:
     * *Punta de la espira*: unclear; on meta-level, 10+7 articles about it (flimsy, yes).
     * *Taitoru*: unclear.
     * *No Sister of Mine*: 6 characters looking for the seventh; on meta-level, 77 threads about it.
     * *The Scolipendra Wiki*: 7 characters wandering in search of a 7-sided object; on meta-level, 7^(2) pieces of fanfiction about it, with wordcount between 7^3 and 7^(4).
     * *I/O*: 7 tracks, one of them (between the fifth and the sixth) missing, each track (34*60+18)/6=343=7^3 seconds long; on meta-level, 14 reviews about it, and Greene gave it a 7.0 score. 
     * *Mavigne*: 7 realms; on meta-level, 7 articles about it.
     * *ex lux*: 7 characters and story threads; on meta-level, posts on 7 blogs, 25*7 Twitter posts.
     * The article itself: SCP-2**7**4**7**, a watchlist of 7000 artists, 7 examples of SCP-2747's manifestations, 7 footnotes.

     *^(I did not expect to do numerology today.)*

    It's likely an incomplete list, and not all provided examples clearly feature all of them. I suppose it's because of lack of information (the Foundation being unable to piece together the full plot of these stories), not because they're optional.
    ```

    - u/ArisKatsaris:
      ```
      Other things that seems to be shared in *some* of the works, and probably it would have been all of them if we had a complete description are probably:  
      - spirals (Punta de la espira title, I/O's cover and themes of 'spirals of isolation and inspiration')  
      - 1 of the 7 elements being ominous, mysterious, unseen or all three. (The Sister in "No Sister of Mine", The Stranger in "ex lux", the realm of "cold and silence" in Mavigne, the missing 'audio track' in I/O)
      ```

      - u/Noumero:
        ```
        Huh, indeed.

        **Spirals:** I think in *ex lux*, the narrative spirals, "as the inner tales eventually begin to intertwine such that later tales shed new light on ones recounted earlier".

        I think something similar happens/is meant to happen in *No Sister of Mine*, when the players are supposed to clear the game's previous areas. Perhaps it needs to happen multiple times, not once? A spiral of a sort, too.

        Hmm, and *Taitoru*'s title is self-referential. It's... No, it's not really a spiral.

        No idea regarding the remaining two.

        **One of the seven is different:** In *The Scolipendra Wiki*, the obvious guess to make is that the "antagonist" is pretending to be one of the main characters. In *Punta de la espira*... perhaps the seventh is the recipient of the gift, but we have frustratingly little information in this case.

        A duality of the "dark destination" may be another commonality: *Punta de la espira*'s mountain is described as either divine or demonic, and *No Sister of Mine*'s tome either gives power or unleashes a curse.
        ```

      - u/CeruleanTresses:
        ```
        Is it possible that the "missing" parts, particularly those that are detectable only through inference (the "fragments," the referenced but unseen antagonists), are not actually part of the anfabula, but are instead evidence that parts of the works had already been annihilated by the time the fanfiction/wiki entries/etc were produced? E.g. maybe the original "No Sister Of Mine" actually contained the fragments necessary to complete the final questline, but they were part of the first fiction tier to be annihilated, so the reviews described a version of the game with conspicuously missing parts. Then presumably the rest of the game vanished after the reviews were posted.

        I think this interpretation fits with the "layers of metafiction" motif pretty well. The reviewers of "No Sister Of Mine" could infer from references in the game that the fragments should exist, but they couldn't find the actual fragments because they were gone. The Foundation can infer from references in the Something Awful threads that the game should exist, but they can't find the actual game because it's gone.
        ```

        - u/daytodave:
          ```
          That's what I'm thinking. And the "coal-black, thornbound tome" described in *No Sister of Mine* is the charcoal manuscript of *Mavigne*, which is also possibly the gift being delivered in *Punta de la espira*, and maybe even the "obsidian emblem" from *The Scolipendra Wiki*; a single item moving up through the layers of meta-narrative. A book that describes the exact nature of reality in detail would of course be able to grant great power, but its presence in a story threatens to complete the *anafabula* pattern, thus unleashing a terrible curse.

      ```

      - u/Noumero:
        ```
        Yes, I know. I realized it far too late, and now trying to fight it would only hasten the destruction — skip from "SCP-2747 destroys the narrative I figured out, turning my effort fruitless" to "I destroy the narrative I figured out, turning my effort fruitless". There's apparently some delay before SCP-2747 starts working on its own, so the first option lets our reality to exist a little longer.

        *Mind you*, that's the worst-case scenario. In all probability my (and u/ArisKatsaris') notes don't contain the *full* description of SCP-2747. After all, all we had to work with were seven brief overviews of the anomaly's manifestations, little to no actual experience with paranormal research, and, what, twelve hours? If that was all it took, the Foundation wouldn't have needed any Lucid Chalices, one bored researcher would've sufficed.

        In fact, I think anthropic principle guarantees that SCP-2747's article doesn't contain the information necessary to piece together SCP-2747 fully, otherwise it would have self-destructed already. There's no cause for concern at all!

        ... Just to be sure, I didn't leave any sevens anywhere, did I? My lists have eight bullet-points, word- and character-counts aren't significant, sevens in direct discussions are on the wrong meta-level, there's 20 (21) comments, 10-18 points... Yep, we're in the clear.

        Wait. No. I now made *six* comments in this thread, *and* sent a PM to a friend recommending to read this article. Seven messages about SCP-2747 made by me, one of them hidden. *Fuck.*

        **Edit:** I broke the aforementioned seven, but it's worse: we identified *six* tropes SCP-2747 requires (destination, duality, fruitless, a seven, the seventh is different, spirals). This line of inquiry needs to end, *immediately*.
        ```

        - u/Flashbunny:

          > Edit: I broke the aforementioned seven, but it's worse: we identified six tropes SCP-2747 requires (destination, duality, fruitless, a seven, the seventh is different, spirals). This line of inquiry needs to end, immediately.

          Considering that the theme isn't [7] but [7, 1 of which is missing and/or different] we'd probably be better off if someone came up with a 7th and posted it - the alternative is someone's going to notice a 7th and not post it, which itself completes the pattern.

          EDIT: Actually, assuming that the 7th trope exists things currently stand at [7 tropes exist, one of which hasn't been discovered], so we're completely screwed even if no-one comes up with one without posting it.
          ```

          - u/Noumero:
            ```
            The solution to that seems obvious — figure out *two* more tropes, bringing the total to 8 — but I'm worried it will be harder than it seems, and then we'll realize we have spent a lot of effort in vain...

            On the other hand, is [7] really invoked in this case? There's nothing to suggest that there's only *one* more trope to discover, not three or two hundred. Would it really count if we leave it at six? That seems unfair, it's 6/N, not 6/7.

            Unless... do our concerns about completing the pattern with seven tropes themselves invoke the trope of seven things? That's such bullshit.
            ```

            - u/Flashbunny:
              ```
              It's not so much our concerns as it is the narrative's predisposition towards the number 7. I think it likely that there is a seventh trope specifically not revealed by the author so that it can exist as the lost one, and given how shaky the concept of [lost/empty] seems to be here, even if we found it it's likely to qualify as such to some degree (though perhaps to a lesser extent, if that matters when invoking symbolism). As such, the obvious solution is indeed the only possible solution - find 2 more tropes and save our universe, with finding 1 perhaps weakening the effect enough to buy us some time... or perhaps just making the struggle seem winnable, such that our inevitable defeat and annihilation seem that much more tragic.

    - u/General_Urist:
      ```
      There seems to also be a theme of blurring/breaking boundaries. I think, I'm not sure.

      *Punta de la Espira*: The mountain alternates between being compared to a "abode of gods" and a "demonic presence".

      *Taitoru*: Explicitly stated that "boundaries blur", implication that insane protagonist slowly loses ability to distinguish between reality and fiction.

      *No sister of mine*: unsure about this one.

      *scolipendra wiki*: Supposedly characters often wonder between different 'realms', and apparently the series is pretty receptive to crossover fanfics with other universes.

      *I/O*: No idea, I'm clueless when it comes to music.

      *Mavigne*: There are numerous 'thresholds' that must be crossed. Also, the book is stated to be a nested frame narrative.

      *Ex Lux*: readers alternate between different story threads, it's written in a mix of 3 different languages, and there's the thing about 'inner tales' intertwining with 'later tales'.
      ```

      - u/Noumero:
        ```
        Yes, there's definitely something of the sort, but I think you're mixing two tropes there. One is the "duality" of the destination: the demonic/divine mountain and *No Sister of Mine*'s power-granting/cursing tome. Also this for *Mavigne*:

        >Mavigne, Or: A Treatise On The Metaphysics Of Inner Space Travel, And The Kingdom Of Erikaar, Whose Name Is **Darkness Made Light**

        The other trope is... Hm. Changing environments separated by thresholds? Different worlds in *The Scolipendra Wiki* (and fanfics? authors?), different narrations and languages in *ex lux*, and different realms in *Mavigne*. *No Sister of Mine*: maybe different levels? *I/O* seems to sharply break the pattern with its "seamless flow" between tracks, but maybe "different tracks" still fits.

        Or vice versa? Transitions are usually seamless, and *Mavigne* breaks the pattern with thresholds? Or thresholds don't matter?

        *Taitoru*: yes, "boundaries blur" may be a clue we can't place because of lack of information. Maybe there were some significant differences between chapters... On the other hand, "a manga divided into chapters" isn't really a noteworthy trope, but then *I/O* and *No Sister of Mine* wouldn't count as well. Hm.

        I'm also clueless regarding music, is it common for albums to have seamless transitions between tracks? Aha, [apparently not](https://www.reddit.com/r/listentothis/comments/2pytiv/discussion_what_albums_out_there_are_single/), thank you, Google.

        Yep, I think that's it, you're right.

        * Blurring of the boundaries between contexts:
         * *Punta de la espira*: unclear.
         * *Taitoru*: a "blurring boundary" between sanity and insanity/real and unreal.
         * *No Sister of Mine*: unclear. Guess: transitions between levels/areas were made seamless.
         * *The Scolipendra Wiki*: inter-universal travellers blurring the boundaries between universes.
         * *I/O*: seamless flow of different tracks.
         * *Mavigne*: blurring of the boundary between the tangible and the intangible (gradual transition from the realm of minerals to the realms of light and silence).
         * *ex lux*: near the end, blurring of the boundaries between different narrations.

        Well, cool. We have seven tropes now.

  Also, 2008 (time of *foundation* of SCP wiki) was repeatedly mentioned as the emergence of this specific SCP.  
  Wondering if it hints a connection between the two (further supporting the 'Foundation is going to be erased' conclusion), or is symbolic of something else entirely.

              Credit being identifying a part of this demonic entity should fulfill the 'dark destination' bit.

                What? No, no, we must do *literally anything other than this*. That is the exact single thing we must not do under any circumstances, why would you even suggest it? We're trying to *not* end reality, not, not-

                Can SCP-2747 bring other aspects of itself into existence? That is, what if once a certain "critical mass" of SCP-2747!tropes is achieved, they somehow end up bringing about the rest of SCP-2747!tropes, destroying the narrative once the process is complete? That... would neatly explain this weird delay with which SCP-2747 works: it allows stories to exist just long enough to have someone comment and review on them, then wipes them out. It's weird behaviour otherwise, why wouldn't it activate the moment a narrative is complete?

                Hypothesis: part of SCP-2747's tropes are [*audience tropes*](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AudienceReactions).

                I think *No Sister of Mine* confirms it. In it, the audience/the gamers were the ones to bring the "futile effort" trope into existence, with their attempts to complete the game.

                So, running with the hypothesis, we're currently directly involved with SCP-2747, possibly influenced by its incomplete body to call into existence the rest of it. *Wonderful.* What have you done, u/KBAREY?

  I'm a bit lost here.  
  1. What exactly is the SCP foundation?  
  2. Is this entry describing a "fictional" concept (as in, a concept that exists in a fictional universe - the SCP universe perhaps, if SCP is fiction), or are they trying to explain a part of "our" reality? 
  I'd really appreciate some clarificarion, because it's really interesting, but I don't know to what extent it's to be taken seriously.

  - u/UltraRedSpectrum:
    ```
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCP_Foundation answers both questions. However to be more explicit, the SCP Foundation is a collaborative fictional universe revolving around a clandestine organization dedicated protecting humanity from the supernatural by tracking down and imprisoning supernatural elements. Users submit entries (SCPs) representing fictional entities or objects imprisoned by the SCP foundations, and they're compiled on the website.

        This is like saying "the sun is a light source".

        More like "The X-Files as a Wiki, with thousands of entries, where about 1/3rd are amusingly harmless, 1/3 bend reality in weird ways, and the other 1/3 present existential threats to humanity, the Earth, the universe, or all possible universes".

      Thank you very much!

    The *SCP Foundation* is a nonexistent work of collaborative fiction. The web contains 823,543 references to *The SCP Foundation*, including a Wikipedia article, a TVTropes page, a Facebook page, and a subreddit. Note that there is in fact no such work of fiction, and the wiki supposedly hosting it does not exist. When pressed, those who supposedly created articles referencing *The SCP Foundation* deny ever having done so.

  Is this another memetic SCP? Because I swear that's all that I see anymore, I'm getting a bit tired of memetic SCPs.
  ```

  - u/Noumero:
    ```
    Technically no, it's not *memetic*. But it's information-based, yes.
    ```

    - u/CeruleanTresses:
      ```
      If we use the article's terminology, I guess it's narremetic!

    Have you read the antimemetics series?

  - u/RynnisOne:

    Memetics spread due to their own nature.

    This is more anti-memetic than anything.
    ```

  - u/icesharkk:
    ```
    Either memetic or infohazzard. Either certain knowledge about it is inherently (self)destructive. Or it just generated and spread a bunch of multi level meta analysts artifacts that never pointed to anything real
