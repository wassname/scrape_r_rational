  Yep, turns out I’m still salty about Blue not feeling a drop of regret at how he treated Red and indeed still holding the same exact mindset, even after his temper cooled. Outright telling your friend that between them being not heroic enough and them dying, you prefer they died, and then standing by your words two months later, way to go Blue. 
  Somehow I doubt Daisy or Gramps would be so pleasant about your ‘disagreement’ with Red if they knew a little bit of the specifics 

  It’s the same exact situation as with dead trainer in the Beedrill meadow, only that time Red successfully talked them out of the suicide run, on the account of them being not prepared at all. 
  And looks like the reason he couldn’t talk Aiko out of going into collapsing building with no plan was (shockingly) that she didn’t want to be not heroic enough. But sure, being angry at Red is reasonable, can’t fault Blue’s logic

    I am having this same reaction - obviously it's totally fine for the character to be this way, but I am just emotionally thirsting for his Die for Honour style attitude to blow something up bad enough that he realizes what a total moron he has been. Until then he sits in this liminal zone of being both protagonist and villian as I read his chapters.
    ```

  - u/XxChronOblivionxX:
    ```
    Part of me is just imagining his loved ones each knowing the specifics, people that he trusts, and having them each tell him the same thing: that he is not only wrong, but horrendously and obviously wrong. He's wrong in a very human way, born out of his grief and pain for his lost friend. But he made a judgement call when he was lashing out, and has yet to let go of it. He told his best friend that it would be better if he was dead, and he needs to beg for forgiveness.
    ```

  - u/mrasiteren:
    ```
    Totally agree. 

    *“And it wouldn’t be killing him now if he hadn’t then. You’re just intent on protecting him, and I get why, but all he was doing was the same thing you asked Red to—”*

    *Blue reaches up and switches off his earpiece, face a mask as he presses his forehead against her back none too gently and closes his eyes. He’s already tried explaining to her the difference between what Gramps did and what Red didn’t do. And she wasn’t there, after, didn’t hear the way he was justifying it. Blue’s not in the mood to hash over it all again.*

    I would be interested to know how Blue justifies not wanting his grandpa to sacrifice himself for his grandson and bystander while thinking Red should have sacrificed himself for his friend. But he buried his head in the sand instead. It just sounds like he believes Red should feel a lot of survivor's guilt as he does and Red's rational explanation just creates a lot of cognitive dissonance for him. Yeesh, as if Red doesn't have enough psychological issues as is.

    On another note, I really liked the contrast between Blue's and Red's social savvy. Both are hella smart but while Blue is killing it on interpersonal and PR fronts, Red is just... well he's learning, that's the important bit!

    I couldn't remember the promise Blue thought Red disclosed to Professor (where he thinks Red is a coward). Can anybody remind me, please?
    ```

    - u/pochinha:
      ```
      > I couldn't remember the promise Blue thought Red disclosed to Professor (where he thinks Red is a coward). Can anybody remind me, please?

      I think he's referring to the promise of going after the stormbringers.
      ```

      - u/mrasiteren:
        ```
        Might be, but then why would he refer to Red as a fucking coward?
        ```

        - u/pochinha:
          ```
          Blue could think Red is a coward for telling the Professor that they plan to hunt the Stormbringers. In Blue's mind, this could mean the Professor stops them from doing so (or comes along). So if Red was afraid of the Stormbringers and didn't want to keep his side of the promise, he could tattle to the Professor or another adult, who would then stop them from going.
          ```

    - u/Leemorry:
      ```
      >Red is just... well he's learning, that's the important bit! 

      Awww c'mon :D   
      I did like how both of them use the advice and knowledge they taught each other, while being all dramatic about how irreconcilable they are.
      ```

  - u/anenymouse:
    ```
    So like Blue clearly feels about as much guilt as anger about Aiko dying, at least partially because of the whole Red didn't die **with** her, but also that he wasn't there either. I mean part of it clearly reminds him of the whole promise to stop the three Stormbringers from hurting anyone ever again, and there Aiko is just a mockery of his aspirations, well their aspirations. Also it doesn't seem like Blue is currently seeing a therapist which i'm vaguely surprised isn't like mandatory from Surge.

    I wonder how much Surge knows about this, cause Sabra was the one that found Red after the previous Second and Aiko went in, that plus the current situation of the group being split up, and her being right there as they ask Blue about a new hospital.
    ```

  - u/JanusTheDoorman:
    ```
    Blue is wrong, but I think it's mostly a holdover reaction from losing his parents. He absorbed the lesson "You lost your parents because you weren't heroic enough". Or, more viscerally, "You lost everything that kept you safe because you weren't heroic enough". 

    He isn't reacting to the rational balance of risk to Red's life vs potential to save the people in the hospital, he's reacting to a fear that his world will be torn apart if people aren't maximally heroic all the time. He lives by the maxim "Heroism is the only thing you can count on to keep yourself safe" and anybody not being maximally heroic is selfishly placing their loved ones at risk.

    Anybody chastising him for his disagreement with Red wouldn't be heard as "You're not weighing your values appropriately", it would be heard as "Your safety isn't worth risking anyone else's life for".
    ```

    - u/thrawnca:
      ```
      >He absorbed the lesson "You lost your parents because you weren't heroic enough"

      See, if he were just overreacting in one direction, then that would be quite understandable and I could respect it.

      What I don't respect is his hypocrisy. Because at the same time as demanding Red be heroic *even when it's suicidal and doesn't achieve the objective* \- expecting and requiring Red to choose a meaningless, pointless death - Blue is trying to prevent his grandfather from making an actually meaningful sacrifice. His attitude is, "People at arm's length from me must sacrifice their lives for my principles, but a person close to me, no, he has to be kept safe even if it means lots of others die." His only consistency in this situation is selfishness.

      He wants Red to reassure people, let them know that he'll lead them right and be loyal? Well, how about the fact that Red is showing good judgement of risk and warning those around him of overwhelming danger? I know I'd feel better about following someone who can *accurately judge* whether or not it's safe and worthwhile to enter a burning building.
      ```

      - u/JanusTheDoorman:
        ```
        Yeah, I mean, he's also like... ten years old.
        ```

        - u/thrawnca:
          ```
          > Yeah, I mean, he's also like... ten years old.

          There are several reasons that that's not a strong argument here. Firstly, pokemon trainers have much more power than real-world 10-year-olds, and are clearly held to higher levels of responsibility. Secondly, he's expecting to lead others, and his advice was aimed at teaching Red to lead others. Thirdly, it doesn't matter how young you are, running into a burning building will still kill you.
          ```

    - u/Leemorry:
      ```
      > "You lost everything that kept you safe because you weren't heroic enough"

      I'm not convinced about this reading, I didn't get that from Blue at all. 
      He was kept safe and supported by both Red's family and his own, he didn't feel unsafe or afraid, it was (and still is) mostly anger & anger management issues.   
      Blue has the same reaction every time Stormbringers are as much as mentioned, his motivation for killing them isn't fear that his world/safety will be torn apart, it's hatred, revenge and white-hot anger.   

      This sounds like I'm roasting him, but I am not, I like him a lot and root for him, I'd be angry at the birds too in his shoes
      ```

      - u/JanusTheDoorman:
        ```
        Yeah, I definitely don't know enough about developmental or traumatic psychology to be strongly confident about what particular responses are likely in this situation, but I feel like anger and revenge aren't mutually exclusive with fear and physical insecurity. If anything I feel like they're the "normal" reaction, trying to reassert an ability to control and protect yourself and ward off potential future attacks.

        The Stormbringers feel like a natural disaster, but natural disasters don't have embodied presences that hang around continuing to kill people. In that way they're more like a big terrorist attack, and we can see a separation in response to terrorist attacks based on whether they seem to be ongoing existential threats to the victim. 

        In post 9/11 America, there was certainly a lot of what looked like white-hot anger and desire for revenge, but the undercurrent was still "We have to prevent this from happening again" consistent with a fear reaction. In an anger-without-fear reaction, I think the narrative would have been much more explicitly punitive, in the way that the Austrian response to the assassination of Franz Ferdinand was. Austria certainly thought they had very little to fear from Serbia, and just wanted to keep the Russians off their back.

        If Blue wasn't scared, he'd have no reason to insist that everyone else also be trying to be as heroic as possible. That part in particular strikes me as fear based - a reaction to a belief that his own efforts are unlikely to be enough to ensure safety.

  With Elaine having been confirmed to have done nothing to follow-up on the kiss, ostensibly because of the fall-out of the Zapdos attack, I think we can confidently state that the most serious fatality of the Stormbringer's assault was *all of our god-damn ships.* At least Daisy is hooking up off-screen!

    Nope, one team would always be Gym leader + members vs trainers. And it's not stated (the characters themselves haven't decided it) but yes, the Gym will probably always be the "wild" pokemon (with some exceptions, eventually, given Surge's particular mindset...)
    ```

    - u/thrawnca:
      ```
      Would the challengers choose their own teams, or be assigned? I can see real-world applications of either. Being able to seek out and recognise complementary traits in others is important. Being able to quickly and effectively work with strangers is important.
      ```

  - u/JanusTheDoorman:
    ```
    It sounds like the Leader and team will always be the wild Pokemon, and the point is that it's not just a 6v6 battle, the challengers will have some particular objective they must fulfill while the scenario is playing out. It isn't stated but I could imagine that each challenger would have a particular individual goal that just be achieved in addition to the overall group good to avoid anyone being carried.
    ```

  - u/onemerrylilac:
    ```
    In the scenario where the two teams battling against each other, as far as I can tell, the badge still goes to the team that won the match, but it's regardless of whether they are attackers or defenders. The win condition is still based on, well, winning. The gym leader doesn't decide who gets it off pure judgement.

    And yeah, the attackers aren't using *all* the skills that trainers should practice, but that's exactly the point the official brings up. Blue argues that other gyms will teach those skills more, the league official has concerns, and the rest of that debate plays out.

    But to be fair, it would probably be helpful for trainers to learn how to make do when they only have one pokemon available to use (in case at some point that's the last one they have left in a wild attack) and how to fight against other pokemon when you can't communicate with your allies. Not sure of a good example for that last point but I'm sure there are uses there.

    At least, that's how I read it.

  "the only leader that blue can think of who might care less what others think of how he runs his gym is Giovanni *(and maybe Blaine, but he doesn't really count)*"

  what did he mean by this?
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    While I have no idea what DaystarEld intends to do with Blaine, I will note that in the Pokemon TV series, Blaine meets potential challengers incognito, forcing them to solve riddles to challenge him in an active volcano. In the games, Blaine initially keeps the riddles but eventually loses his gym and all of his gym trainers in the aftermath of the destruction of Cinnabar. He becomes a hermit who holds gym challengers in his cave near the ruins of his old gym. Traditionally, Blaine is a quirky old man who could not care less what people think of his gym.

  So, just a thought, but how much does Snorlax costs to maintain? Stats:

  1014.1 lbs. 	460.0 kg

  Heck, from Bulbapedia:

  Snorlax is often found in mountains and forests. It wakes up only to eat, requiring 900 lbs. (400 kg) of food per day before returning to its slumber. It is not a picky eater, as its strong stomach allows it to eat even moldy food without feeling any ill effects. It can even handle thorny plants or Muk's poison. It can also eat while it is resting. Snorlax is docile enough to let children and small Pokémon bounce on its large stomach.
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    Pokeball tech helps a lot; in general they make maintaining a whole menagerie of living creatures possible in the first place, but yeah I definitely see high upkeep pokemon like snorlax being more expensive, thus limiting their use somewhat outside of critical situations.
