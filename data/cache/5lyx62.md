  This is beautiful and I love how the omakes of *this* quest qualifies as fanfiction of fanfiction of fanfiction.

      There's *Orders of Magnitude*, a fan-prequel to *Significant Digits*, a fan-sequel to *Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality*, a fanfic of *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*.  

      That's a layer deeper even before fic and omake of *Orders* is considered...

        If we're considering canon to be level one then this is level four; Naruto -> MfD -> omake of MfD -> quest based off of omake. 

        There was also:

        HP -> HPMOR -> Following the Phoenix -> Squiring the Phoenix
        ```
