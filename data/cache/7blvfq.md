## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  So I've just had the very broad strokes of an idea. Here it is:

  “**We** have bestowed upon humanity a Game. Play it. Learn its intricacies. Master its systems. Because in 2^8 days, it becomes real.”

  Or in other words, an ROB (that is, Random Omnipotent Being) has created an MMO and tells people to play it. They aren't forced to, but 256 days from the announcement, people will become their in-game character, gaining their abilities and equipment. On the flipside, monsters will also start appearing in the real world. Individual physical locations might change, but the world itself will still be "planet earth"; this wouldn't be an isekai.

  In the following paragraphs, I'm going to talk about some initial ideas I've had. If you want to get directly to the part where I ask people to contribute ideas, scroll down below the line break.

  The plan would be to have one "book" about the 256 days leading up to the conversion (I haven't even started thinking about what the plot would entail), and however many books necessary about the world after to get to a "stable state" so to speak.

  By ROB fiat, the game is playable on literally any device with a screen and input (so if you really wanted to, you could play it on an oscilloscope) which means that pretty much everyone on the planet is be able to play, should they so choose. That being said, while the game *does* somehow run on nokia flip phones and calculator watches, it's deliberately designed to be easier to play the more "realistic" the play medium is. A mouse+keyboard is worse than a wiimote and nunchuck is worse than a kinect. (I'd need to figure out *how* to make the game naturally easier that way, though-- m+kb is almost always the best control surface IRL).

  After the 256 days, death will of course be permanent, but prior to that, death "kills" your character, forcing you to start over at lvl 1 with a new character, with the additional restriction that you can't choose the same set of starting choices as you chose initially (this is a big deal) and you can't choose the exact same character design (not a big deal). You also get locked out of playing until the next (calendar) day, so that someone can't kill themselves 256+1 times and not have any character options.

  For starting choices, I'm thinking of heavily restricting the player options. Namely, that there would only be 8 total "abilities" to pick, and you get a "primary" ability slot and a "secondary" slot, both of which can have the same ability in order to specialize.

  That being said, these "abilities" would be very broad; think worm power categories (ex. mover, blaster) rather than something more specific (like regular MMO abilities), and individuals would develop their own abilities though some system. Which brings me to the questions I have for you guys:

  ----
  I'll be asking a few questions from the perspective of the ROB "game designer". Note that my "job" is easier for a few reasons:

  1. I'm not restricted by the computational power of what the game is run on; a literal toaster could run the game at full quality.
  2. My servers can "magically" connect to any computer with no latency and 100% uptime.
  3. Outputs (ex. graphics, sound, and even stuff like smell, taste, and touch, if supported) are maximally good for the output system they exist on, and will asymptotically approach "lifelike" the better the displays/sound systems get.
  4. Inputs are used to their maximal potential. A kinect camera will be able to track you near-perfectly by vision, although its limited to the detail it can get out of its limited resolution.

  And onto the worldbuilding questions:

  * Given that there will only be ~~8~~ 16 broad categories that need to do double duty as both a character's primary class and subclass, what should these categories be? (think "mover, area-of-effect, healer, whatever). Note that no class can directly affect a player's mental state before or after the game becomes real, (so no "thinker") class, but classes that indirectly affect it (such as an alchemist class creating LSD) are kosher.
  * With 256 possible combinations of starting categories, someone can kill themselves once per day (in-game) and not have a remaining character combination when the game becomes real. What should I do in that case? I'm currently leaning towards having a special "final" ability that people who do that get, and if I implement that, what suggestions do you have for that ability?
  * I abhor LitRPGs that are all about grinding stats and levels. So how do I design a MMO with a combat system that a.) doesn't have levels (but will probably still have stats to some extent), but also b.) doesn't play out like an FPS, where if you don't have twitch reflexes and great input system, you simply can't compete (as this would be a worldwide phenomenon, and most people *don't* have great twitch reflexes, or gaming keyboards and mice)
  * m+kb is the superior input system of the vast majority of games for a number of reasons, with a few exceptions for things like racing games and realistic flight sims. How do I make a game where it's an advantage to use the most "realistic" input system available to you, despite the fact that think like headtracking or wiimotes are usually inconvenient and difficult to use in games, even though they have a closer to 1-1 correspondence with real movement. Note that the game shouldn't *restrict* the ability of people to play the game with non-realistic input systems: I "want" as many people as possible to play it.
  * How do I go around designing a system where players can create new abilities based off their class/subclass/any external knowledge they have without either making player abilities seem arbitrary or having to nail everything down to stats that bog down the story flow?
  ```

    MMOs are all about grinding. From the game-designer's perspective, this means making the grind as enjoyable as possible. From a LitRPG perspective, it means making the grind as enjoyable *to read about* as possible. These are very different.

    > m+kb is the superior input system of the vast majority of games for a number of reasons, with a few exceptions for things like racing games and realistic flight sims.

    Have you tried out any VR systems? What makes mouse+keyboard wonderful is that it's both easy to use and easy to develop for. The keyboard makes it easy to interact with the game-world in predefined ways. The trick for the game developers is to make those predefined ways seem complete, while in reality they never even come close. While VR systems currently don't even come close to what already exists, we can already glimpse how they could be used to create a game experience that gives players limitless interaction options. If you haven't tried VR, I recommend visiting an arcade at some point. For "research".

    Played any trading card games? M:tG does a pretty good job of this. Hundreds of new cards are created every year, each with unique effects, with the potential to change how players interact. What's really interesting is that the cards interact with the *rules* rather than other cards. Even though each new card has its own unique rules, this doesn't create a combinatoric increase in game interaction logic.

      To clarify, I specifically hate grinding *for levels*. I intentionally avoid games where characters have strict power curves based on the amount of time players have spent smashing rats, or whatever. I have fewer problems with grinding for items, although that's with the caveat that I much prefer when items in MMOs are sidegrades that let you do something different rather than upgrades. The MMO I've had by far the most experience with is Planetside 2, where levels have absolutely no bearing on the ability to kill other planetmen, and the grinding for currency, beyond a certain basic point of getting the equipment to deal with specific situations (like having to unlock an AA launcher to deal with planes), doesn't actually make you better, because you can only equip one set of equipment at a time anyways. Similarly, I plan for my next MMO to be Star Citizen (if it ever gets released, anyways...), which also won't have individual character stats to grind. And in the interim, I'm playing Overwatch, where I don't have to grind at all (although it's not actually an mmo...)

      I've had very limited experience with an oculus rift dk1 (just a demo at an event) and played one of those arcade games with the pull-down headset. VR is indeed really interesting from the point of immersion, but while immersion makes games more fun, it doesn't make you *better* at the game. For example, in FPS games, you have people deliberately lowering graphics to get better IFF, even if they have a monster gaming rig. M+KB is great because you can have a large number of instant inputs with the keyboard, and the mouse lets you make small, precise motions that are difficult to replicate with a controller, joystick, or especially wiimote/other handheld motion sensor.

      Which is what makes my dilemna so difficult-- I'm trying to think of how to make M+KB inferior, but *without* gimping it. That being said, I do have some ideas. Looking at, for example, warthunder, m+kb becomes worse than joysticks when mouse controls stop being first-order (ex, point where you want to go) and begin to be second order (point at a section of the screen to determine roll/pitch rate) and third order (point at a section of the screen to control a virtual rudders and flaps that in turn control roll and pitch) because joysticks stay second order the whole time. The trick would be to figure out how to make most input devices consistently second order, but it's difficult to visualize how that would work in an efficient manner when controlling an avatar, rather than a vehicle.

      That's a really good point, actually. Though as with trading card games, there would of course be the problem of avoiding power creep :P

        > To clarify, I specifically hate grinding for levels.

        My experience is that modern MMOs don't grind for levels. I hear some people are still playing Everquest, which doesn't have a level cap. I literally cannot imagine. On the other hand, WoW has a level cap, even if each level is a substantial investment. In Guild Wars, the design decision was to make each level an hour or two of play at most. The point is for players to quickly reach max level and start the real grind. In many RPGs, even if there isn't a level cap, the boss monsters will scale with player level, so that grinding just makes it harder. Do whatever will make the best story.

        > VR is indeed really interesting from the point of immersion, but while immersion makes games more fun, it doesn't make you better at the game.

        While immersion is where VR excels, that's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about how players interact with the game world.

        In an FPS, keyboard and mouse rules not because they are superior inputs, but because they cover all situations that matter *to an FPS*. Why would you pick up a chair and hit someone with it when you can just shoot them? The fact that you can't do something you wouldn't want to do never even crosses the player's mind. This is by design. Think about the differences even among first person games. Say, Overwatch and Minecraft. You can't even do the same sorts of things in these games. Each shows the very real limitations of the other. If the game world were as real as possible, it would allow players to do everything that either game allows. On the other hand, designing the inputs to such a system would be a nightmare.

        My point here is that more realistic inputs allow players to interact with the game world in more flexible ways. Hopefully that flexibility is worth giving up the agility granted by more rigid input systems.

    Congratulations! You've done the easter egg to unlock the Challenge Class! You have no special abilities / some really bad special abilities. Have fun! 

    This is based on the "Wanderer" class in Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup (roguelike), which has a random set of starting skills and equipment. It's meant to be a challenge: you might end up with a greataxe and heavy armour and low STR but very high INT.

    8 classes:

     - Mage: Elemental/blaster
     - Cleric: Buff/healing
     - Enchanter: AoE/noncombat
     - Ranger: Ranged
     - Bulwark: High Defense
     - Berserker: Pure damage
     - Rogue: Stealth/trickery
     - Dancer: Dodge/movement

    Most of your abilities are determined by your primary class: mage/cleric/enchanter are primary spellcasters, ranger/bulwark/berserker are primary fighters, and rogue/dancer are primary utility.

    If you double up for your secondary class, you will be more powerful but less versatile.  

    If you stay in the same category (eg. Mage/Cleric), you can benefit from many obvious synergies that are available (+ magic power items are more useful, you are best on the back lines, etc).  

    Taking your second class *across* categories, on the other hand, has specific hardcoded advantages.  Berserker/Mages can deal bonus elemental damage with their attacks, Ranger/Rogues make good assassins, and Dancer/Bulwarks are very good tanks.

    There are 8 double-class, 14 in-category, and 42 cross-category builds available in this system.  (Where are you getting 256 from?  Is there another two bits of choice?)
    ```

    - u/GaBeRockKing:
      ```
      >(Where are you getting 256 from? Is there another two bits of choice?)

      8 choices, that can be doubled up on. So you can go Rogue-dancer, Dancer-rogue, or Dancer-dancer, for example. The first "class" gives you your primary abilities. The second class specializes you. Or at least, that's one of the possible ways to A-B be different from B-A, while still picking from the same 8 categories in each slot.

      As for your list, I think it's pretty solid. The idea of having "supercategories", so to speak, would be an interesting way to impose order on abilities developed by people.
      ```

      - u/ulyssessword:
        ```
        I'm still getting 64 from that.  8 first choices, 8 second choices = 8 * 8 = 64

          ```
          Oh man, I've derped hard. I was thinking 2^8, which would be 8 binary choices made in sequence. derp. Guess it's back to the drawing board... Though admittedly, the system still works, and now I get to think up 16 classes instead of 8. Or maybe a system of 8 classes, and then 5 binary questions (for example, AOE-RANGED-ENERGY-IMMOVABLE-OUTPUT Magus, or POINT-CLOSE COMBAT-PHYSICAL-MOBILE-DEFENSE Defender). There's a lot of interesting options, actually.

    - Some people (think remote tribesmen in the Amazon or similar) will have access to no computing devices at all. For complete saturation, I recommend the ROB permitting the game to be played in any *reflective surface* (i.e. puddles of water can work), with the surface acting as a touchscreen. Naturally, this would be the lowest-computing-power option.

    - Some people (babies in particular) will have no conception or understanding how to play the game. They might mess around with a parent's phone in any case, just picking options at random. This results in a non-negligible possibility of dozens of babies across the world suddenly obtaining Full Starting Equipment on start-day. (And some may have bumbled their way through a level or two by sheer coincidence - or by another person holding their elbow and poking their hands at the screen ('yes, dear, but if I get baby through one more level she'll have a passive healing aura, you can't tell me that won't be worth it'...)).

    > How do I go around designing a system where players can create new abilities based off their class/subclass/any external knowledge they have without either making player abilities seem arbitrary or having to nail everything down to stats that bog down the story flow?

    How about this - apart from primary class and subclass, powers have to have a *theme*, which is constant for a given character. This theme is chosen by the player, and depends on the player's understanding of that theme. So, a player might choose the theme of *fire*, which makes pyromaniac abilities very easy but healing abilities very hard (except Cauterize). (Mind you, a Fire theme can be used to cool something down - by removing its fire - as well as warm it up).

  Hoping to collect some opinions for a short story I’m working on.

  Say there were a ritual which granted unaging immortality. The specifics of immortality can match whatever flavor you find most desirable, for the purposes of setting up this scenario.

  The rules of the ritual are as follows:

  * The ritual can only be performed *once*, and will only affect the current living population of Earth (anyone born after will have a normal lifespan)
  * The ritual simply needs to be read from a scroll, which you currently have
  * When the ritual is finished, X% of the world’s population (chosen randomly) will instantly die. The remaining percent will be granted immortal life. All people have the same chance of being chosen for death, even you the scroll-reader, and there’s no way to know beforehand who will be chosen.

  Given that…

  * What value of ‘X’ would make it *definitely* worth it for you, the scroll-reader? What value (range) would make you *unsure*, but still consider it? At what value would it definitely *not* be worth it?
  * Same as above, but in the eyes of the general public. Obviously the views will span all possible values (and likely there would be some who wouldn’t even *want* immortality), but what’s the highest bound limit of X that the *majority* of people would accept, if it meant a chance to become immortal?
  ```

  - u/Gurkenglas:
    ```
    As you command, this answer assumes the specifics of immortality I find most desirable: Opt-out invincibility to physical effects such as force, aging, disease and starvation.

    If the method of death is heart failure, a global coordinative effort to set up defibrillation for everyone in advance would make it worth it for almost all percentages. If one's "life force" leaves, so that modern medicine can't revive the corpses, cryonics is still an option, but it's even more outlandish to suppose that the public will agree to that.

    If I were selfish, a few percent would be worth it, for that is a ballpark for a lower bound on the chance I'd die anyway before a global paradigm shift. Any value would make the scroll worth keeping in hand in case the existential risk situation turns dire in ways the scroll can help with.
    ```

  - u/ben_oni:
    ```
    Any non-zero X is worthwhile. This is mathematically verifiable. If the ritual is not performed, 100% of the population will die (eventually). If it is performed, the maximum number of man-years lost is (human lifespan)x(population). ~~If even one person survives to become immortal~~ Let's make it a breading population that lives to become immortal. Then an infinite number of man-years are gained, which is greater than the finite number lost. And the benefit of guaranteeing the perpetuation of the species for eternity? Priceless.
    ```

    - u/vakusdrake:
      ```
      The immortality is stated to not apply to any new human that will be born. Also you're making the assumption life extension aging prevention doesn't make significant progress in the (likely longer) lifetime of any humans alive today.

      Also even if no current humans could be saved you're making the assumption that the potential disutility of people being unable to opt to die will be worth it over trillions  or more years. Particularly when you consider that (excluding human  extinction) technology allowing immortality will inevitably come around _eventually_ and even if it was millennia from now that would still mean nearly all human-descendants to ever live would live after its advent.
      ```

      - u/ben_oni:

        > The immortality is stated to not apply to any new human that will be born.

        So? Irrelevant.

        > Also you're making the assumption life extension aging prevention doesn't make significant progress in the (likely longer) lifetime of any humans alive today.

        Again, irrelevant. I'm assuming that no one alive at the time of the ritual would otherwise live forever. As *very* safe assumption.

        > technology allowing immortality will inevitably come around eventually

        We've been over this. You're still wrong, and I don't care to repeat the discussion. Besides, OP said it was whatever flavor of immortality I most prefer. I do not prefer the weaker sorts of immortality usually proposed by futurists.

  I've come up with a dumb but amusing idea. Take the standard Japanese mecha show, and invert the premise. Instead of humans building mechs to fight inside, you either get mechs creating humans to act as pilots to enhance their capabilties, or humans creating mini-mechs to act as pilots to enhance their capabilities. I think it'd be potentially interesting to explore the question of pilot-mech synchronization from this angle, contrived though it might be. There are some echoes of Yeerk-human synergy concepts from r!Animorphs here.
  ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    I don't think humans building mechs to pilot them is terribly contrived, except insofar as you would never actually build a *mech*, you would just build a brain interface that would take over and pilot you from time to time. Though actually, it would be well-possible that people might benefit from giving that "pilot" a personality and visual identity, along with some rudimentary communication ability, even if that only existed as a virtual display.

    As far as story went, you would probably want some drawbacks to the "piloting", other than just the loss of autonomy. The narrative constraint I would want to put on would be something like "no more than thirty minutes a day" or "to get the most use out of the internal mech you need to jailbreak it and remove the safeties that prevent it from injuring you". Oh, and some need to "sync" the mech, meaning that you actually are building up a relationship. And from there you have some built-in tension to work with, and could focus a story on, say, a skilled gymnast who competes in these human/mech cooperative events that go beyond what mere human muscle memory and cognition can do.

    Or, if you wanted a more shonen mecha thing, a young boy who has been implanted by a godly powerful minimech by his father and is now on the run from the government or a corporation or something -- capable of turning into an expert marksman at the drop of a hat, gets in lots of cool fights, etc.
