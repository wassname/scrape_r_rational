  Are you a fan of roguelikes, perhaps ?

    I am, as it happens, but I must admit I don't see the connection. Which roguelikes use AUs?

      Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup measures time in AUTs (Arbitrary Unit of Time), which is different from player turns, which can be of variable length in AUTs.

        Weight used to be measured in Arbitrary Units of Mass, too.

    - u/tilkau:
      ```
      Angband (and most variants) uses AUs for gold; IIRC intended to have a literal meaning: 'AU', and a pun meaning: 'Au'. Until weight was abolished (hurrah!), DCSS was using AUMs for weight.

      That's actually all I could think of offhand. I guess Angband's usage of au really stuck in my mind for some reason. EDIT: yes, and AUTs like nifboy mentions.

    As a counterpoint, it could be extremely dangerous to be promoted to Chunin before you are ready, which can happen if your teammate totally carries you through the exam.  Also, I feel like her's is a pretty reasonable and realistic (though perhaps not rational) emotional response to 1) seeing that your teammate doesn't respect you or trust your abilities (esp. in a domain you consider a particular strength) and 2) going through a high stress situation and probably working really hard to accomplish something and not let down your team, only to find out that nothing you did mattered.  Desiring communication from your teammates is pretty reasonable.

    That said, I totally get where you're coming from.  HPMOR!Hermione occasionally annoyed me, and I think it was for similar reasons.

      Cheating on tests is an area of strength for Sakura?

      The point isn't to get a perfect score on your questions, the point is to be in the top half. And the top half will be the people who stole answers from the bottom half and have way more answers than they were given questions.

      If Sakura only perfectly answered her own questions then I doubt she would have passed the exam.
      ```

  - u/eaglejarl:
    ```
    Both of them, actually.  

    Also, Naruto's solution was brilliant.

      I'm not sure you can count it as brilliance when the author changed the rules in a way that was easily gamed by shadow clones.
      ```

      - u/eaglejarl:
        ```
        I didn't think of that solution, and when I read it I had a "oh, cool!" response.

        Did you think of it?

  ```
  Very nice.  I always enjoy the cheat-to-win test in the Chunin Exams.

  At first I was thinking people might deliberately write down wrong answers and "accidentally" let their opponents copy them, then they themselves simply don't hand in those sheets.  Then I remembered that you don't get penalized for wrong answers, so that would just be a waste.

  Ino should have used her mind control jutsu to sabotage others instead of just steal answers.  She could have made them run around tearing up other people's answer sheets, which would have gotten the possessed person so many negative points they would have been out, along with their entire team, and would have ruined the ability of the attacked person to turn in answer sheets without stealing someone else's.  That would have been a great way to take Gaara out -- possess Temari or her brother and get them DQ'd by sabotaging other students and then punching out an invigilator.  (Also, why 'invigilator' instead of the more usual 'proctor'?)

  What was the method that Shikamaru thought of but didn't use?
  ```

  - u/diraniola:
    ```
    Shikamaru probably thought of the Naruto method but has the interpersonal skills to not use it. He also told Ino to run interference, which I assume means sabotaging others answer sheets. I'm also not sure that any of team 10 know about Gaara, so they would have no reason to target him.
    ```

    - u/Transfuturist:
      ```
      > has the interpersonal skills to not use it

      I'm dying.
      ```

    - u/eaglejarl:
      ```
      > Shikamaru probably thought of the Naruto method but has the interpersonal skills to not use it. 

      Also, he can't make hundreds of shadow clones, so I don't think he has the option.  He could have manually filled in a bunch of sheets, but I doubt he had hundreds of them.

      > I'm also not sure that any of team 10 know about Gaara, so they would have no reason to target him.

      Good point.
      ```

      - u/diraniola:
        ```
        Realistically, he wouldn't need to. Shadow possession both teammates at once, start writing. Keep writing until time is called. As long as less than half of the room writes answers at the same speed or faster, you pass. Probably the only one who would beat him in volume would be team 7 because of shenanigans.
        ```

  - u/Velorien:
    ```
    I think if Ino had been so blatant in her use of her abilities, the invigilators would have officially spotted them, at which point she'd risk being penalised for every individual thing she did through a possessed body. In the event, she did do some sabotage - as we see from Shikamaru's instruction - but sparsely and only as applied to specific targets.

    I don't really know which is more common of "invigilator" and "proctor" - I heard both while at university - so I went with the one I felt sounded better.

    diraniola is right about Shikamaru's method, although it would have required certain adjustments, since Shikamaru doesn't use shadow clones and doing it by hand is a bad idea for multiple reasons.
    ```

    - u/Riddle-Tom_Riddle:
      ```
      Today is quite literally the first time I remember hearing of the word 'invigilator'. It is something that surprised me more than a little, and caused me to stumble enough in my reading that I had to look it up.
      ```

      - u/PeridexisErrant:
        ```
        Huh, it's more common than "proctor" in Australia - at least in my experience.
        ```

- u/Jiro_T:
  ```
  Examiners: "The rules require that you write the question and answer on the answer sheets.  Answer sheets were described as being, and I quote, 'in front of you' at the start of the test.  Since your clones were not in front of you at that moment, clones are not considered answer sheets and all answers given on clones disguised as answer sheets are disqualified.  Also, you seem to have created the clones with pre-written answers, violating the rule that you write the question and answer, so you'd have been disqualified on that basis alone".

  Or even more simply: "Ninjas are expected to understand orders, not blindly follow their literal words.  Cloning yourself into answer sheets may fit the literal words of the rules, but clearly doesn't indicate actual comprehension of the intent behind them.  Disqualified."

  This chapter is bothersome because it seems to use the geek fallacy of "what I did is what you literally asked for, so you have nothing to complain about" thinking the world works like a computer program.  There may be one or two cases, such as with bureaucracies, where you can get away with it, but it usually fails miserably; in the real world it just gets you marked as a smartass.  Naruto here is like the person who sees items on sale for 0.50 cents and tries to buy 200 of them for a dollar, even though context makes it obvious that someone meant $0.50 and just didn't write it down properly.
  ```

  - u/eaglejarl:
    ```
    The exam isn't about the questions, the exam is about cheating.  This is very clear from the way the rules are structured, the challenge rating of the questions, and the fact that *ninja* -- information gathering is a far more valuable skill than academics, and it is far more sensible to test that.

    Sasuke and Sakura tick me off, though.  It's about getting it done, guys, not about your ego.
    ```

  - u/Velorien:
    ```
    If the purpose of exam is to prove that ninja can follow the intent of the rules, then they should not cheat at all. There is nothing in the wording of those rules that remotely implies that cheating is permissible except the fact that the punishment for cheating is something less than disqualification.

    Rather, the purpose of the exam is to test cheating ability as much as, if not more than, academic ability. Given that this is the case, they are not going to punish him for an act of cheating that fits within the stated rules of the exam.

    Which it does.

    > In front of you are question sheets, each containing a unique set of ten questions randomly selected from this yearâ€™s database, and answer sheets with your name and seat number printed on them.

    Statement.

    > Write the question numbers, together with your answers, on the answer sheets.

    Instruction.

    > For every correct question-answer pair handed in at the end of the test, you will receive one point.

    Statement.

    It is only by inference that these three sentences are related to each other, and if your objective is to cheat, then you are entitled to choose not to make that inference.
    ```

  - u/The_Fallen_Child:
    ```
    The point of the test is to see how clever ninja are, if you're in an actual battle with someone and you have an ability that they don't know about that's an advantage for you.

    If you are taking a test that tests your ability to be clever and you have an ability the proctors don't know about it is in your best interest to utilize that ability

      Shikamaru is a smart guy he's probably much smarter than me afterall, I trust his judgement.
      ```

      - u/4t0m:
        ```
        Shikamaru was indeed smarter than we were.
        ```

- u/Revisional_Sin:
  ```
  "For every correct question-answer pair handed in at the end of test, you will receive one point"

  According to his wording everyone will receive points for every correct answer that is submitted by somebody. 

  The winning strategy is to take a nap.
  ```

  - u/Velorien:
    ```
    Surely the winning strategy is still what Naruto did, namely:

    a) Strongly distinguish himself from the other examinees in the examiners' minds (because they'll need *some* criteria if they only want to pass half the group)

    b) Gather as much information as possible to aid in future stages of the exam

    Also, nice one.
    ```

- u/abcd_z:
  ```
  If the questions are all unique, why was Sasuke blindly copying from a genin a few rows away?  The text said nothing about Sasuke being able to see the genin's text to make sure they were the *right* questions to copy.

  Also, who was the Naruto-clone disguised as?  The only blonde females I can think of would be female-naruto or Temari.  Or was he just disguised as a random blonde ninja?
  ```

  - u/Velorien:
    ```
    Naruto was disguised as the blonde examiner who registered Team Seven. See if you can guess why Ibiki immediately tried to knock her out.
    ```

    - u/MadScientist95387:
      ```
      Ibiki is aware of the impending invasion and wanted to stop "her" from blurting out information that might let the sound/sand genin realize they know?
      ```

  - u/4t0m:
    ```
    It doesn't matter whether they are the "right questions" since you get points for any correct "question number" + "answer" pair.  What I'm more concerned about is confirming that the copied answers are correct.  I'm not sure how Naruto managed to get every question right since the questions were stated to be so difficult.  You would expect some incorrect answers to be passed around, and Naruto would need to know the answers himself to either correct these responses or choose between various options.  Maybe as questions are collected by better cheaters, answers are corrected (since being better at answering questions and being better at cheated are probably correlated), but this process wouldn't be perfect.
    (Edit: I was confused.)

    Also, even if Sasuke did need answers to his specific questions, he could just blindly copy random people who seem to be writing a lot and erase/cross out any useless info.
    ```

    - u/Velorien:
      ```
      Naruto doesn't need to copy anyone. If we assume that Naruto is smart enough to correctly answer his own sheet, he can just copy that 199 times.

      Alternatively, he can just dispel the clones he's put on the ceiling, which have a bird's eye view of the classroom. Between them, they have to get enough data to raise his number of correct questions to 10.
      ```

      - u/4t0m:
        ```
        Ah okay, I misinterpreted a few things.  First, I thought that the was able to answer the question you gave an example not only because he was smart but also because clones were a particular interest of his.  Also, while I at first thought that he was using the test as an opportunity to observe his opponents, at some point I got the impression (I really can't say why) that he was using his vantage point to acquire *all* of the question+answer combinations.  This is unnecessary given his shadow clone strategy, and confused me for the reasons I mention above.
        ```

      - u/JackStargazer:
        ```
        > Naruto doesn't need to copy anyone. If we assume that Naruto is smart enough to correctly answer his own sheet, he can just copy that 199 times.

        Actually, as you get points for each correct "question answer pair", you don't even need to go that far.

        Solve the easiest question. Make as many copies of that question and answer as possible within the time limit. Win. 300 copies of question 1 is worth just as many points as 30 copies of all 10 questions, and it's quicker to solve and copy.
        ```

        - u/Velorien:
          ```
          True. On the other hand, given that Naruto had nothing but time on his hands during the exam, there's no reason why he wouldn't have a go at solving the other questions anyway. It's also a more effective way of showing off - "look, I can complete the challenge as formally presented *and* as implied".
          ```

    - u/abcd_z:
      ```
      > It doesn't matter whether they are the "right questions" since you get points for any correct "question number" + "answer" pair. 

      Ah, so it is.  I missed that part.
      ```

    - u/GlueBoy:
      ```
      From what I understood, incorrect answers don't matter. So even if you have 5 different answers to a question, as long 1 is correct you get a point.
      ```

      - u/4t0m:
        ```
        Good point.  Still sort of inelegant, and every question still needs to be seen by someone who can generate the answer for Naruto to get them all right.

        It's described in the story as "Two hundred copies of the exact same **sheet of correct answers**"

        (Edit: I was confused.)
        ```
