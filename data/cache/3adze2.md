## Some ideas I've had recently

### Post:

So I've been thinking a lot about that martian transhuman setting I made a post about earlier, about the mythology of the green lantern corps. and objects of power in general, and about the show Steven Universe.

The main idea I'm interested in is an Object of Power that searches through the cosmos to find someone Worthy. The exact logistics of that are interesting but can be figured out later.

I imagine that while there would be a central planet and generally benevolent and powerful beings in charge, they would try to be diplomats rather than police. It would also be focused on them making mistakes and working through growing pains rather than being literal billions of years old.

The backstory is that they are artificial beings created by a Sufficiently Advanced Civilization (future humans). They were given some general goals about making the universe a better place and acknowledging and including the perspectives of as many sentient races as possible before being abandoned.

The Steven Universe influence is largely aesthetic, with these beings being made of hard light with a crystalline core. They're technology is all based on self-sufficient hyper advanced crystalline constructs and hard light projections. My imagination says it looks really rad.

So let's say you are a hyper advanced crystal being with basically human values. How do you go about accomplishing the goals you were assigned? I have some ideas, but I'd love to here your guys' suggestions as well.

P.S. you should really check out Steven Universe. While the main character isn't exactly rational, he does display impressive emotional intelligence which is something I think this sub could stand to emphasize more.

Edit: It occurs to me that this probably isn't quite enough information to go on. Feel free to ask about their specific capabilities or whether something would be possible. Technologies they definitely have access to: hard light projections, really thorough scanning, very small and powerful computers, ftl travel, pocket dimensions, and remote energy transfer. They aren't likely to go for agi, seeing as that's what they're for.

  What are my resources?

  Create pocket dimensions that contain arbitrarily large and ever-expanding perfect eternal computational substrates linked by FTL gateways, and upload everyone and everything into them. Finally, after everyone has been rescued from the messy entropic universe, upload myself as I turn the lights off.

    An interesting proposal. Unfortunately you forgot the part about asking everyone what they wanted. 

    Also, I'll clarify some limits on the pocket dimensions for everyone here: They have a finite amount of space, and have to be maintained through outside energy. The larger they are, the more energy it takes to maintain them.

    I'm also more interested in initial strategies rather than the main end goal. Especially since, even with ftl, searching the entire known universe for sentient life will take a very very long time. And this ftl is of the gotta go fast rather than the portal variety. The fastest you'll ever get is a few months between galaxies, and that would require a great deal of improvement to the stuff you start with.

    Edit: Thanks for the suggestion, btw. I didn't realize that other people wouldn't think of the same thing when I said "pocket dimension".
