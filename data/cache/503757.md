  I'm just wrapping up the characters bit and I don't agree completely with your self assessment... I think you're being too critical -  not wrong, exactly, it's just that some of it was a non-issue in my opinion... I'll elaborate more when I'm not tired. Although that might change my opinion, too...

  Also, you could ask people things if you get stuck figuring things out... How to go from having a name to finding a person in this society? Shit, run it like a story/rpg campaign hybrid with a few people playing Jess. Give them an objective, let them ask questions about the specifics of the setting, and they could propose a plan of action.

  I'd have been down to do something like that.

  Also, I really liked the setting. Got any worldbuilding notes you would share? Love to run a tabletop rpg in it.

  **Characterization**

  Ok, for Jesse, I'd rate her as 435 (or maybe 445) character. 
  Her competence level is quite clear in that she's very competent for her age (as befit a daughter taught by her father who is 5 on the competence ladder) and so her hacking the museum protection while not being competent enough to recreate a golem like Rob from the grounds up isn't surprising. As the main view point character she's very sympathetic. In term of proactivity, Rob also comes up with quite a few suggestions so she's not the only person leading the story.

  The main thing though is that this didn't feel like half of the book, it felt the first quarter of the book and it's totally ok for the antagonist not to appear within the first quarter. It wouldn't really have been a problem to have an increased presence of Brianne after. As an antagonist, she could have been quite interesting since from her point of view she would have seen herself preventing a catastrophe while from the point of view of Rob and Jess, she would have been seen as an evil jealous person. I'm also not sure that the relationship character needs to be clearly defined by chapter 2. 

  The only thing I really think wouldn't work at all with the story as told  to Jess's grand niece was your plan to have Jess spend a quarter of the story or so in prison. This would have made the flow of the story difficult I feel.

  **Things that I think went well**

  I agree with you on most of your points. I believe that to date, this is your best work in term of characters. They were all differentiated, and very likable. In term of world building, this was also your best work I feel. 

  In term of the rule of cool, I don't completely agree with you. There are a lot of startups or companies that become big and successful because they used an arbitrage opportunity that they discovered. Of course, it can't be too simple or else it's unrealistic but with both Jess and Rob, they could have found a plausible business model.

  As said, I also don't think your primary viewpoint character was mismanaged since I really thought she was perfect for the role.

  In the end, I have to say I'm pretty disappointed since it was the first work you did since the Two Year Emperor that I really enjoyed (I liked Anko at the beginning but found the plot too messy in the end). I didn't read the Change Storms series beyond the first two chapters though. Will have to do that one day.

  As the title says, this chapter is critical analysis and writing advice, not actual narrative.  Skip it if the craft of writing doesn't interest you.
