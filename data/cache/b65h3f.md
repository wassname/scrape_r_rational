## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding and Writing Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*
* Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is *also* the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  **Seeking: Eutopias**

  I'm poking around with a new story idea, aiming at being more hopeful than my last one. So I'm trying to think up ways to exceed reedspacer's lower bound. I'm starting by jotting down the existing settings I can think of, and what they bring to the table. Can you suggest any ideas I may be neglecting?

  --- 

  - Iain Banks' "The Culture" (space! Immortality if you want it!) [bleah bored modosophonts] ?The Minds, drug glands?
  - "Thousand Tales" (uploading! Immortality! Custom VRs and avatars! Important jobs to be done!) [bleah techno-primitivists, anti-upload terrorists] ?AIs?
  - "The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect" (uploading! Immortality! VRs! safety!) [bleah boredom, bleah nihilism] ?PI's value-function?
  - "Friendship is Optimal" (uploading & immortality & VRs! Custom communities!) [bleah constant nudging towards ponydom] ?CelestAI?
  - Star Trek (space exploration! Strange aliens! Cute aliens!) [bleah hostile aliens, bleah wars]
  - the "Bitchin Society" from Doctorow's "Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom" (clone-revival immortality!)
  - Spider Robinson's telepathic future (a culture made out of sane people!)
  - Elf Sternberg's "Pendor" (Space! Ringworld! Cute aliens!)
  - Scott Alexander's "Archipelago" (liberal values! Communities for all sorts of folks!)
  - "The Millennial Project: Colonizing the Galaxy in 8 Easy Steps" (space! Easy to start!)
  - Varley's "Eight Worlds" (Space! Custom bodies & memory-backup immortality!) [bleah Earth being off-limits]
  - Eclipse Phase (space! Tech! Uploading & immortality! Important jobs to be done (as part of Firewall)!) [bleah Titans, exsurgents, corp-states, people stuck in clanking masses] ?Prometheans?
  - "Orion's Arm" (Space! Uploading and personal mental upgrading! Strange aliens!) [lots of bleahs: Queen of Pain, perversities, blights, etc] ?Higher-level minds?
  - Disneyland (fun! Cute people!) [bleah capitalist-derived exclusivity]
  - Oz, ruled by Ozma (fun! Safe! cute/strange nonhuman people!)
  - James Cameron's "Avatar" (glowy plants & animals! A close-knit community!) [bleah techno-primitivism, bleah hostile militaries, bleah conflicts]
  - "Ready Player One' (fun!) [bleah almost all non-VR life]
  - some depictions of heaven (immortality! community!) [bleah exclusivity]
  - the Harry Potter wizarding world (a "zeroth world" better-than-first-world society!) [bleah dementors, racism, etc]

    Don't forget Greg Egan's far-future novels, which feature universal immortality, uploading, and generally enlightened societies with very little conflict.  Could be tough to set a story in that sort of setting, though- unless, like Egan, you're mostly just using it as a backdrop for clever thought experiments.

    Another, more ambiguously utopian setting would be the pre-Melding Plague Yellowstone system from Alastair Reynolds' novels- which had a post-scarcity economy, ubiquitous transhumanism, and life extension, but also had psychopathic AIs, people trapped in "voluntary tyrannies", and which ultimately collapsed horrifically.

      I've got both those series in my to-read pile, though in the past I've tried reading them and bounced off. Are there any details of the settings more relevant than that they both explore transhumanism?

      > Could be tough to set a story in that sort of setting, though

      There's plenty of kinds of narrative conflict, from the "Sector General" space-hospital series, to Arthur C. Clarke's "The Songs of Distant Earth".

        Hard to answer for Greg Egan - many of his stories take specific elements or pieces of terminology from each other, but they don't build up into a single setting. (For one thing, the Earth would have been physically destroyed at least twice.)

        Immortality! Uploading! Self-modification and copying, with the attendant existential mindfucks - except in stories where it's just normal. Space travel but no FTL, so people and cultures 10,000 years old with all the stability that implies. Post-scarcity, by the high standards of the main characters. (my favourite: in *Incandescence*, one character's request for enough energy to boost a 1kg supercomputer to relativistic speeds is described as "on the edge of politeness".) A taboo around exponential growth is mentioned sometimes, which might explain how they've managed to not use up any stars over the millenia, but it's unclear if this is something that everyone keeps to or just the characters who bring it up. No super-AI by authorial fiat - one story mentions a "General Intelligence Theorem" stating that all minds of at least human intelligence can solve the same class of problems, and the only real upgrades past that point are in speed and memory space. Ditto for aliens, when they exist.

  I'm working along writing a VRMMO fiction that focuses on a small company that (almost accidentally) creates the first true VR, when they try to build one up around an AI alternative. Mostly going to be a bunch of connected stories about the dev teams building the world and testing different aspects, formed into an overall narrative. There's a lot of Westworld-style ideas I want to apply, and character building I have ideas for, but I don't have a *solid* outline, really. I mostly just want some fun fluffy writing to put in the rotation of my more serious/drama writing stuff.

    As someone who generally hates furry stuff:

    Most furry stuff is in the "funny animals" style, rather than actual anthropomorphized animal style. Most of the weird and strange things about animals get sanded away to make them more appealing to humans. It's much easier to tell visually though, and in terms of text, I'll tend to immediately bounce from any story with anthro animals just because it's so likely to be furry stuff that I'd rather not bother.

    (This is pretty common for people who have exposure to fetish stuff that they don't like; if someone gets pregnant in a story, they're much more likely to assume that this is fetishistic than just someone getting pregnant as part of the story in a non-fetish way, and they're leave before the assumed fetish stuff happens. So you've got that working against you.)

    As for how to predict whether or not something is fetish material, and therefore disguise fetish material as non-fetish material ... a lot of it is vocabulary, and some of it is just the attention and focus of the prose. Fetish vocabulary often mimics that of erotica in its descriptions of the object of fetish, which for furry stuff is, e.g. tails, paws, fur, etc. All that stuff then gets a lot of description and mention in the prose, much more than you would expect of a non-fetish version. The near-constant reminders are a big signal.

    I personally think it's pretty doomed. Furries are a well-known group, and most people will just (correctly) assume that you're a furry if you're writing about anthro animals, regardless of what's in the text itself.

    The most important piece of advice I know is to imagine dropping humans in place of your furry characters; if the story still makes sense, then it's obvious that it's furry fiction instead of fiction containing some kind of anthropomorphic animal. There are plenty of ways around that: fantasy furries as another kind of elf/dwarf/orc/etc; SF with geneered critters; urban fantasy with shapeshifters; modern social commentary ala Zootopia; and more.

    (Amateur authours have been asking similar questions for years about their favoured meta-genres, like the decades-old transformation story mailing list.)

    I think also avoiding the standard "sexy" fursonas will help: so all dogs/wolves/foxes are out. As well as Lucario, Gardevoir, and Renamon. 

    Why do you want it to be furry specifically? Could you do it "feral" style, like Animals of Farthing Wood, Watership Down, or The Rats of NIMH? If so, then depending on your universe, you could even pass it off as fanfiction of one of the above.

    Abuse the rationalist part of:

    >Genre Savviness: characters are familiar with common genre tropes and try to avoid or exploit them.

    So a cat girl - or her companions - would make jokes about her being a cat girl, and she would intentionally act in defiance of those tropes. Make the non-rationalist characters behave in ways where they "don't get it" on all sides of the spectrum (e.g. both overly furry and overly anti-furry).
