  I also wrote [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/mywccm/it_is_perfectly_valid_to_want_your_game_to_be/gvytz9j/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3) on the post, but it’ll probably get buried:

  > This is how I feel about my fantasy reading material. I tend to do a lot of theorycrafting while I read and inconsistencies end up being frustratingly immersion breaking. There’s actually a whole community of people who love reading books with internally consistent worldbuilding over at r/rational and r/HPMOR. If you’re at all interested in reading a fantasy story with an internally consistent magic system and a world that has been drastically shaped by said system in believable ways, I highly recommend checking out [Mother of Learning](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21220/mother-of-learning), which is considered to be one of the best works in the genre. [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/fuiikt/recommended_fiction_list/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) has a big list of similar stories.

  I mean he sort of defeats his own argument. 

  He admits that what matters isn't realism but consistency, and that the abilities of any character in a game depends on the sort of feel you're going for. He never justifies why the feel he likes is superior to that of other tones, other than claim that it's more "serious" and "gritty" while what he doesn't like is "silly." 

  Then he brings up Lord of the Rings as being more serious, but it has a bunch of comedic moments and non-magical people performing superheroic stunts. 

  He never explains why a table should adhere to any value of seriousness beyond his personal tastes. His constantly bringing up "silliness" is an emotional appeal, not a rational one. 

  Then there is the slip into passive sentence structure. "...when the world has presented itself as gritty..." Except the world doesn't exist and does not present itself. 

  In DnD, the setting and its people are created by the interactions of the DM and the players. We're a bunch of people sitting around the table (or our webcams) for hours on end having a conversation.

    I think you are missing their point. They are refuting the argument "Dragons and magic are not realistic, so nothing else has to be realistic. Therefore, I should be able to do a quadruple backflip for no in-story reason"

    Their argument is that internal consistency is a thing, and also that when a dm is going for a certain tone, players shouldn't be like "eh, magic exists so this is a silly world anyway, let's do whatever". Both good points.

    It kindof falls into a trap that you see a lot in highly upvoted reddit posts, ie, The Impassioned Argument for Something Everyone Agrees With.

    Everyone likes stories with consistent rules, of course including 'magic' doesn't mean that suddenly anything is possible. Yes, LotR and TPB are tonally different. Yes, it wouldn't make sense for Aragorn to pull out a gun. It's a winded takedown of a strawman that no one would argue for.

    The real issue here (I think) is something a bit different: what do you do when the DM and the players have different ideas of how to play? The DM wants to keep things grounded, while the players want to have fun and try to pull off some ridiculous stunts. There are different values at play here in what makes a good game of DnD, and questions of what weight to give aspects such as storytelling, player choice and creativity in a game where everyone needs to work together in order to make a story.

      Yeah, when I DM I tend to make things fairly "anime" with levels of exaggerated action and ability. That doesn't make them "more unrealistic" it just means the tone is different. Arguing for internal consistency is good, but arguing that "internal consistency" means "gritty" or "realistic" is absurd.

      You are right that that would be the correct conversation for the DM to have with their players, but as an argument against the player's argument it is solid. (Within the conversation that is missing the point.) It could be constructive in justifying to the player that they should be having the other conversation.

    Not really. The point they're making is that character have certain traits, and someone randomly adding on to that "for the lulz" or to make their playthrough easier breaks the game. This is true for every story, there are a set of rules that govern the world, and breaking those (at least, without cause) detracts from the story.

    > Then he brings up Lord of the Rings as being more serious, but it has a bunch of comedic moments and non-magical people performing superheroic stunts.
    > 
    > 

    This was really only added in the movies, and even then it's presented more as a racial trait than anything else (at least, if you're talking about Legolas and Gimli and the Orcs). There are a few stand outs like Aragon and Gandalf, but in general, people in LotR are just people, and fight and get hurt and die like normal people.

      In the books, there was Tom Bombadil.  
      Completely took me out of the story.  
      After that anything could happen at any time, with no explanation given.  
      LOTR never felt consistent to me. I'd place it firmly in the Marvel-movie class of storytelling.  
      EDIT: This isn't meant to sound overly dismissive.   
      Marvel is very good at storytelling.  
      I just prefer stories that make actual sense, rather than just narrative sense.

  - u/VorpalAuroch:

    Realism and consistency are not really different, except in degree.

    Also, while the LotR movies have some superheroic stuff, I don't think anyone but Gimli who does anything of that kind could be reasonably described as nonmagical. And most of it is absent in the books. Elves literally see the world as flat, Aragorn is a relic of an ancient part-Elven bloodline with a number of understated magical relics to his name, Frodo and Sam have the Ring when they pull off their stunts (and the phial of starlight).

    And even given their advantages, they still are much more consistent about their rules than the Princess Bride, which makes no attempt whatsoever to have internal consistency.

    I didn't see him defeat his argument anywhere. It's not that one is superior, it's that players and gm should agree on and stick to a consistent tone and theme for the game.  There absolutely IS world building happening, and it's ok for players and the GM to want that world to be consistent and take it seriously
    ```

  - u/OnlyEvonix:

    I don't think he ever tried to argue it's better as a whole, just that it's fine for people to prefer it.

  >But Aragorn pulling out an M16 and pair of aviators is the universe breaking its own rules.

  That sentence reminds me of [this old meme.](https://i.imgur.com/JcChIdd.jpg)
