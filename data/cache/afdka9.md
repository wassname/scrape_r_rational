  The last lines about the clouds.. Quite the change of pace.   Amazing, if a little tragic chapter. Shikamaru's sense of powerlessness as he tried to coordinate was really well written.

    Cheers! That's exactly what I was going for. One of the big frustrations is life is that sometimes you can see exactly how things are going to go wrong, but you're unable to get anyone to listen. Following (inter)national politics over the past few years has had me feeling pretty much exactly like Shikamaru in this chapter.

  This time I've included the Author's notes at the top of the chapter instead of posting them here, as requested. Originally I was going to post an entire interim chapter about rationality to cover the gap between this update and the last, but that ended up... not happening. If you would like to see me write more about pure rationality, let me know!

    It would be interesting to see those chapters, maybe not in between the main story but somewhere.

  Something that I really liked about this piece of fanfiction is how you emphasize the existence of consequences for the decision to avoid unpleasant topics and tasks. You did a great job with Kakashi when he talked about how one of the reasons why his team died is that he was just to embarrassed to point out an obvious mistake made by Minato and in this chapter you did a similarly great job of showing the consequences of Shikamaru's laziness.
  ```

    Thanks! I really wanted to drive home the point that a lot of things go wrong purely because of small and totally unnecessary mistakes, so I'm glad I got that point across. It's sort of a "banality of evil" argument, except for irrationality.

    This chapter was also meant to show why Shikamaru couldn't be the main character of the story. A lot of people asked me when I started writing why Naruto should be the MC, and not someone smarter like Sasuke or Shikamaru or Sakura. And the explanation for that is, well, intelligence is simply not enough to make you rational. You also have to care, and be creative, and \*want\* to save the world. Shikamaru fails as a rationalist because he does not start thinking until the fight has already started, and that is simply way too late to make a difference. Like the Fourth Hokage said, battles are decided by the time swords are drawn, not when they are sheathed...

      You're describing the difference between being *proactive* and being *reactive*, or when it's applied to a main character, the difference between an *active protagonist* and a *passive protagonist*.

      Setting aside the obvious benefits of the former from a rational perspective, *proactive* characters are far more interesting in a storytelling sense, at least when the story follows them continuously, because they have goals and ambition to accomplish something, and set out to do it the best they can.  Things don't just 'happen' to them, they happen in response to their actions.

      You never want your main character to be a passive protagonist, as it almost always comes across as less interesting, if not outright boring.  You see this a lot in YA or kids fiction, like in Hunger Games or the Series of Unfortunate Events.  Great for their age category, incredibly dull for older people as you really don't *care* for the characters.  But for side characters with a high mortality rate, like these?  It's great, because you give a contrast to the main character that shows why the latter *is* the main character.  

      Sophronius is totally right.  Intelligence is just an attribute, its how you use it that counts.  Shikamaru is about as far on the passive side of the active-passive spectrum as you can get.  He did well because of his intelligence and powers, but he never really had much motivation to use them.  This is a far more likely ending for even the *original* character in its universe.
      ```

    - u/EthanCC:
      ```
      I think those attributes apply more to the ratfic protagonist archetype, specifically the HPMoR "save the world whether they want it or not" type. It's not like you can't be rational and also a complete psychopath.
      ```

      - u/Sophronius:
        ```
        Okay, sure, but you have to have \*some\* type of goal. Instrumental Rationality is defined as your ability to optimize towards achieving your goals. I don't think you can meaningfully call someone rational if they just lie in bed all day. Also, I think people vastly exaggerate the number of people who genuinely have zero empathy - I think that most people who are called psychopaths just have some kind of mental illness or brain damage, or care about some people but lack the imagination to extend that caring to others, and such a person could hardly be called rational.
        ```

  Hmmm.  What an amazing (un)surprise that the people from another village you share your deepest secrets with (despite only having previously met them as antagonists) could *ever* possibly use that against you. A shocker for the ages.

  I'm unsurprised it backfired on these guys so easily, but I'm still curious as to why R-Naruto and R-Sasuke would be so eager to include the Sand Duo, earlier, especially as they live in a world full of paranoid killers.

  I find it unusual that the guy who works with extreme body-modification would fall so easily to poison.  Even if he didn't mess with his metabolism or alter his body at the physical and chemical level (all possible ways for his size and mass-manipulation to work) that could interfere with foreign chemicals, it seems reasonable that his increased size would result in a thicker layer of body fat (or empty space between the layers for when he goes into 'balloon mode'), which would serve to prevent attacks from small poisoned weapons from delivering their payloads to anything but his capillaries (which would be one reason to do it in the first place).  I mean, his schtick really isn't helpful against these guys on his own, so he'd probably die anyway, this just seemed an unusual way to go.

  Also, since when is the puppet that strong?  Both Kiba and his dog are super-charged with some 'savage' chakra that vastly increase the strength of their already impressive muscles, but the guy that uses telekinetic strings is somehow able to move them with greater strength?  I'm surprised this guy bothers using puppets at all.  If he can move objects with such power, he might as well just use their universe's equivalent of really thin piano wire and move it so fast it could cut through limbs while being barely visible.  He could thus have physical 'strings' that most people assume he needs to control and manipulate the puppets by maintaining a chakra connection.  If anything, this serves as a layer of deception to his powers that gives him an advantage, as people tend to focus on the puppet as the real threat, only to find out too late that the strings themselves are far more deadly.  A rational Kankuro is NOT an enemy I would ever want to be forced to fight, ninja powers or no.

  **EDIT** :  Also, amazing update to an amazing story.  Thank you for continuing this series.

    >I find it unusual that the guy who works with extreme body-modification would fall so easily to poison.

    It's not body modification - that would be ridiculously powerful when taken to its logical extreme. I didn't have time to explain it yet in-story, but Choji's technique works by creating a shell of chakra around his body; essentially using a modified version of the shadow clone technique to create a second, larger body around himself. You can see that this is also how it works in canon, like when Choji takes a hit and his giant body 'pops' just like a shadow clone. 

    >Also, since when is the puppet that strong?  Both Kiba and his dog are  super-charged with some 'savage' chakra that vastly increase the  strength of their already impressive muscles, but the guy that uses  telekinetic strings is somehow able to move them with greater strength?

    Two chapters ago, Naruto and Kankuro discuss the puppet technique, and they mention that it's a two-parter which uses chakra strings to 'project' the puppet technique (this part is also canon, I think). In other words, Kankuro uses chakra strings to cast a kind of spirit-projection technique onto his puppet so that he can move it like his own body, and with much more strength than the strings themselves. Otherwise there would be no point in making a humanoid puppet, just like you said. (Naruto also points this out in Kankuro's fight with Tenten, back in the chunin exams)

    You're right that this still shouldn't be enough strength to rip Akamaru apart, but remember that Kankuro's puppet has saws and blades installed. So he did not so much pull the dogs limbs apart as hack them off and then toss them back at Kiba.

    I hope I didn't upset any dog-owners with that description. :c

    >I'm unsurprised it backfired on these guys so easily, but I'm still  curious as to why R-Naruto and R-Sasuke would be so eager to include the  Sand Duo, earlier, especially as they live in a world full of paranoid  killers.

    In the case of Sasuke? Well, as the great Emperor Palpatine once put it, "[POWAH! UNLIMITED POWAH!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg14jNbBb-8)"

    Sasuke wants vengeance. He is up against a ridiculously powerful opponent who he \*knows\* he cannot beat using just his own abilities, so he'll take any opportunity he can get to become stronger. He was perfectly well aware that he was endangering the Leaf in the process, but who cares when it helps him achieve his real goals?

    As for Naruto, if you go back two chapters, you can see how he was originally dead-set against the idea only to be played by Sasuke like a schmuck:

    >“You want to trade techniques with us?”  Naruto looked around at the others, searching for any sign that they  thought it as mad as it clearly was. “But we fought each other during  the chūnin exams. How can you possibly want to trade with us after I  ki-”  
    >  
    >Sakura yanked Naruto back by the shoulder,  nearly causing him to stumble and fall. “What my friend is trying to say  is that we wouldn’t want to get you into any kind of trouble. Surely  the rest of your Village would not be too happy if you shared your  secrets with us?”  
    >  
    >Sasuke and  Sakura glanced at each other, though Naruto was honestly not sure what  the glance was supposed to convey. His teammates might both consider him  ‘unbearably naïve’, but when it came to trusting ninjas from a foreign  Village whose sibling he had murdered he was hardly about to disagree.  
    >  
    >“All right,” said Sasuke. He turned towards the Sand ninjas. “In that case…”  
    >  
    >“Hold on,” Naruto protested, “this whole meeting was *my* idea. Don’t I get a say in things?”  
    >  
    >“Fair enough,” said Sasuke. “What do you think?”  
    >  
    >“Uhm,” said  Naruto, realizing that he now had to come up with an opinion. “I mean, I  kinda agree with Hinata-chan that the whole thing seems… weird. But if  they really do wanna work with us, it could be a very good thing. Uhm,  meaning the benefits outweighs the risk, as long as we don’t reveal our  biggest weaknesses to them or anything.” He absolutely *had* to  get his hands on that puppet technique, and so did the rest of the  group, whether they knew it or not. Besides which, this could be a once  in a lifetime opportunity to try and mend the mistakes of the past and maybe even prevent a war in the future.

    As Sasuke hinted at when he was training Hinata, he can get Naruto to take just about any position just by pissing him off and playing on his lingering feelings of resentment, and then taking the opposite position:

    >The illusion  crossed its arms. “I refuse! I stubbornly refuse to follow your  perfectly sensible suggestion even though it’s exactly what I would have  done anyway. But since I know that’s what you would *expect* me to say I’ll instead do the exact opposite of what I just said purely out of spite. So there!”  
    >  
    >“See,” said  Sasuke, “that whole process would have taken a lot longer with the real  Naruto. I think I keep making him too self-aware by accident because he  has access to my brain instead of the noodle-fuelled mush inside of his  own skull.”

    Add in a little Sharingan genjutsu like you saw in the last chapter, and yeah, Sasuke can pretty much play him like a flute.

      But he can hit with it... How is hitting and getting hit different? :p

      - u/Sophronius:
        ```
        Shadow clones can also hit things! Sure, you can damage your knuckles punching someone, but it hurts the other guy a lot more or else you wouldn't be doing it. Also, there's a reason why NTBS!Choji prefers to increase the size of his weapons instead of making his entire body a bigger target: If you have your technique take on the properties of hardened wood or steel rather than flesh, it's much less likely to get damaged and therefore disrupted. Naruto also prefers to have his clones fight by using techniques or throwing explosives for exactly that same reason.

        It's also possible that your technique is less likely to get disrupted if you know its about to get damaged, because you can adjust the flow of chakra accordingly: I.e. when one of canon!Naruto's clones intentionally gets stabbed to trick the enemy into thinking he's the real one.

      This was a good solid reply.

      > Choji's technique works by creating a shell of chakra around his body
      That makes a lot of sense, actually.  Still, this is one of those situations where one has to wonder why they had such a limited variant of a technique, and why it wasn't developed to be more useful.  But that's on the original show.  I can accept this explanation, it makes sense.

      > You're right that this still shouldn't be enough strength to rip Akamaru apart, but remember that Kankuro's puppet has saws and blades installed. So he did not so much pull the dogs limbs apart as hack them off and then toss them back at Kiba.

      This explanation, not so much.  It is still predicated on the assumption that projecting chakra at a distance and enhancing the puppet will provide *more* strength than an already physically strong opponent using chakra to boost their own muscles *directly*, which seems really hard to believe.

      There was also no 'hacking' or 'sawing' going on in the original description.  Within an instant, he was drawn and quartered before he had time to mount any sort of response whatsoever.   It seems rather unbelievable, honestly, especially as this requires Kankuro's projections to be both faster and stronger in actions than Kiba's.  It's your story and all, I just find it really hard to believe that it would be done so quickly and effortlessly.

      I can picture the entire battle in my head as I read it, but this part always just brings me right out.  Still, it's your story, and my nitpicks don't mean I don't appreciate it.  I enjoy the rest of it immensely and its been a great read, so thanks for that.

      >  he can get Naruto to take just about any position just by pissing him off and playing on his lingering feelings of resentment

      See, I guess I get the Sasuke thing, he just seems super reckless about it.  If I simply go with him not being a Rational character (or one whose failed at a key calculation), then it's less of an issue.  He's in a hurry and wants his power now, and really doesn't care who else suffers for it.  So I'm good with that, because it makes sense with the character development he's gone through.

      I just don't get why Naruto has all the same emotional and inferiority baggage as the original.  He's supposed to be the Rational protagonist, and he's overcome some of his other issues while logically having others (his drive to learn more about the system tends to blind him as to many of the implications, and he rarely pays attention to the complexities of social interaction), but this version has the same fears and neuroses toward Sasuke as the original.  And it doesn't quite make sense to me as to why.  Why does he have these negative feelings toward Sasuke in this version?
      ```

      - u/GreatSwordsmith:
        ```
        Kankuro's puppet doesn't have to be faster than Akamaru in order to take him down with blades, first off the puppet is probably strong enough to take a hit and keep going so even if Akamaru got some good bites in before the blades came out it wouldn't make a difference. Secondly the puppet is not a human, the blades that cut apart Akamaru wouldn't come from the arm area, where they would have to move a sizable distance before they could help, the blades would come straight out of the chest area, barely having to move at all before they could take Akamaru out.

        Your other point about why R!Naruto made such a stupid mistake is pretty interesting. Firstly Naruto hates Sasuke here because during their spar way back in the first few chapters Sasuke was pretty sadistic towards Naruto. That kind of intentional infliction of pain is the sort of thing that colors your opinion of someone forever. The reason why the hate is so deep is because despite it being clear to Naruto that Sasuke is a psychopath, no one else takes his concerns seriously, even when theyre presented with the same evidence. Because of Sasuke's ability and predilection to manipulate people, and due to Naruto's experience in the land of waves where he took Sasuke's stated motives at face value and got burned for it, Naruto is subconsciously assuming everything Sasuke says is a lie intended to manipulate him, if he were doing this consciously he would realize that reverse psychology is a possibility, but this is just a dumb reflex Naruto learned after things going horribly wrong every time he took Sasuke's advice, so right now he's pretty easily manipulated.

        The other reason why both R!Naruto and R!Sasuke were okay with the sand technique trading scheme is that while it is very dangerous and probably a bad idea, I don't think it's as bad an idea as you seem to think it is. They clearly prevented the sand siblings from looking at every technique they shared, unless more trades happened off screen the only effect of the trade was that the leaf knew about the chakra string technique, and the sand knew about the poor man's flying thunder God technique. If we look at this fight, I don't think the result would be appreciably different if the sand were turned away. The main reasons the leaf lost this fight was that the sand were prepared, they got knowledge like how to counter Shino and Tenten, not from the technique sharing but from the chunin exams, and shikimaru used all his actions to stop Tenten from doing stupid shit. I mean in this fight most of their opponents werent even a part of the technique sharing session.

  Oh- I just realized the potential consequences of the jutsu exchange if anybody makes the connection between Naruto hosting it and the Sand Siblings being there and part of it Shikamaru was surprised to see them there, so perhaps the clans weren’t aware of the Sand Siblings’ participation... Naruto could get in some serious trouble
