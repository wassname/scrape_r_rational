## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

    I tried it a few times. I haven't managed to not crash it past 10 actions. 
    It doesn't seem much better than something like cleverbot, except for the fact that it's slightly (though not by much) better at keeping track of what was said. It's also a bit less random, but still pretty bad at preventing contradictions.

    I kept spawning in the wilderness and then suddenly leaving the kitchen to enter the living room of a house I had never entered.

    At least it's ok at grammar.

  Are there any decent fantasy wilderness survival stories out there? For example, I really enjoy reading the first few chapters of a lot of isekai stories where the main character is stuck in a forest/cave/desert and being able to fireball the wildlife is balanced out by the wildlife being able to shoot lightning back.

  - u/Get_Blitzed:
    ```
    I love the same thing I'm always on the look out for more. The ones on top of my head that I can recommand are:

    [The Perks of Immortality](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21623/the-perks-of-immortality)

    [Gamble](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26165/gamble) (This one is on hiatus)

    [Chronicles of Primordial Wars](https://www.novelupdates.com/series/chronicles-of-primordial-wars/) (This one is a translated chinese webnovel, might be very different to what you're used to if you're not familiar with asian fantasy novels)

    And that's it sadly, good survival novels are hard to come by, most start out decently then fizzle out after a few chapters. There is a novel that I think deserves a mention though; [The Acts of Androkles](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25012/the-acts-of-androkles), this one is not really a survival novel but I get very similar vibes from it plus it's incredibly well written and engaging. I highly recommand it!

  The Magnus Archives is a horror podcast. I like it a lot. It is not particularly rational, but there is an aspect of it that y'all might like: it has worldbuilding and it is possible to deduce the rules of the worldbuilding before they are revealed.

    Interesting recommendation. 

    You might check out the "SAYER" podcast, it's a kind of sci-fi horror fiction podcast. Give the first two episodes a shot if it sounds interesting to you.

    Hook:
    You are awoken from stasis travel on Typhon(an artificial moon) by SAYER, a fully self aware but limited AI, that manages everything on Typhon. Fans of this sub should be able to imagine how terrifying that is.

  I'm repeating my ask from [three weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/dy4bm2/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/f80rvur/?context=3) in case anyone has more ideas. (See below for my reaction to the recommendations there.)

  I'm looking for stories with realistic portrayal of skill acquisition (in contrast to the infamous "[training montage](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardWorkMontage)"). Hopefully, focusing on motivation/[determination](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Tsuyoku_naritai) and overcoming setbacks.

  The difficulty should lie in the training, and the path towards improvement known. The first part of [Mother of Learning](https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/1/Mother-of-Learning)fits perfectly, but then the focus shifts considerably. The best example I've found so far is [Hikaru no Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hikaru_no_Go). [Protector of the Small](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protector_of_the_Small) is also quite good.

  Also tangentially related are stories taking place in a learning environment: the first few books of [Harry Potter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter), [HPMOR](http://www.hpmor.com/) minus the battles, and [Anathem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anathem)>! (minus the ending)!<. There was a post asking for academy-centered stories and I've tried [Super Powereds](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17879100-super-powereds?from_search=true&qid=8LNZlfqkqx&rank=1) based on a rec there; but it's not quite what I'm looking for.

  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

  * First rec was [Tales of the Solar Clipper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Lowell#Trader's_Tales_From_the_Golden_Age_Of_The_Solar_Clipper)*,* and I've read the first two books in the series, about a newly-orphaned kid working his way up the position rank on a spaceship. The setting was perfect, but the story unfortunately disappointing. The first book started out promising, but by the second book >!it becomes apparent that the protagonist has no real obstacles in his path: he passes his qualifying exams without too much struggle, comes up with amazing business ventures, and have half the female crew fall for him by book two. !<It was a good idea, and I thank u/iftttAcct2 for recommending it.
  * Second rec was the [Cradle](https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0753FP6SP?ref_=dbs_w_series&storeType=ebooks) series, and I've read the first book. It's a cultivation story and was an interesting read. The main character had real struggles to contend with, and he approached them open-eyed and with resourcefulness. However, the focus of the writing is more on the adventure/epic-saga and of acquiring magic power-ups than on methodical skill-acquisition *per se*. This is not a complaint about the book, just a mismatch for my personal taste, and I would be open to reading more of the series if the focus is different in later books. Thank you for the recommendation u/xamueljones.

  - u/IICVX:
    ```
    I'd definitely recommend [The Nothing Mage](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/27904/the-nothing-mage), which has a neat take on things - there's a really well developed theory of magic, and the main character blows that theory out of the water (in a believable sense, not in a "you are the chosen one so the rules don't apply to you" sense)

    But there's still a structured curriculum for students with a clear path for advancement, and he just has to figure out how to get his freaky magic to fit in to it (after developing the tools to do so).
    ```

    - u/TREB0R:
      ```
      I tried this story and stopped after the first chapter. The writing just felt awkward with character interaction feeling contrived.
      ```

      - u/IICVX:
        ```
        That's fair, but a lot of stories on RR are like that; it often takes a chapter or three for the author to find their voice. 

        If a story does well despite having a bad intro I'll usually skim it to see if I can figure out why people like it.
        ```

        - u/ArgusTheCat:
          ```
          As an RR author, I think it's because a lot of us who hit the front page didn't expect it.  I got pushed to write more because people liked my stuff, and that encouragement had me essentially powerleveling my writing skill. 

          I should really go redo chapters 1-4 though.
          ```

  - u/fassina2:
    ```
    I'd recommend reading Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell. It has a fairly good description and interpretation of skill acquisition. Beware of the 10k hours rule it's kind of bs and bad rationality, there's plenty of criticism of it online, but overhaul if you are interested in skill acquisition and what it entails it's a good book.

    &#x200B;

    There's a cap on how good people can get at anything, and the effort required grows exponentially. People can technically get to the top 10% on X competitive field in less than 6 months without much effort, but getting those last 10% becomes exponentially more difficult and more often than not the potential benefit is not worth the effort. 

    &#x200B;

    So stories where the point is train / work hard and get better indefinitely tend to seem silly to me. There's a cap, and the benefits after a certain point aren't worth the effort. 

    &#x200B;

    In fact I'd much rather have stories with cool magic systems with power caps where conflicts are won with strategy, planning and tactics rather than X is better because (s)he worked harder for longer.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      If we're talking about non-fiction about skill acquisition, then [Mastery](https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=mastery&qid=), [Make Time](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37880811-make-time), and [Smarter Faster Better](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25733966-smarter-faster-better). [Principles](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34536488-principles) and [Good to Great](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/76865.Good_to_Great) are more specifically focused on business and management, but I'm just a writer and ESL teacher and I still got a lot out of them.

      I'd LOVE to see some fiction about someone mastering a skill.
      ```

      - u/fassina2:
        ```
        Make time and Smarter Faster Better are new to me thank you. I'll check them out. 

        You should check out the other side of the discussion on it The Athlete Gene is a good one. This one shows arguments and evidence in favor of inborn advantages in sports but can apply to many different areas. He criticizes a lot of the 10k hours and it's proponents arguments..

        I assume you read Playing to Win by Sirlin. That one is great and free. That's literally a non fiction rational guide to winning at competitions, with the authors story in esports to back it up.
        ```

      - u/MemoriaPraeteritorum:
        ```
        That's a really good compilations of books. I should add to the list a newly-published one: [Ultralearning](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44770129-ultralearning?from_search=true&qid=wqdeeKhqLE&rank=1), which focuses on designing ambitious mini-projects as a way for leveling-up a skill.
        ```

    - u/MemoriaPraeteritorum:
      ```
      Thank you for the rec, I have indeed read *Outliers,* as well as *Talent is Overrated* which has a similar theme. Let me answer your kind suggestion with another one. From your last sentence, it sounds like you'd appreciate the complementary strategy of developing a broad range of skills to a good level, rather than drilling on that one single skill. The new book [Range](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41795733-range?from_search=true&qid=JJ6R7Yh45m&rank=3) describes this idea as a direct counterpoint to Gladwell's *Outliers.*
      ```

      - u/fassina2:
        ```
        Thank you I'll check it out. You might also like the recs I made in this comment and the recs he gave me on his:

        Are you familiar with 80/20, opportunity cost and ROI ? If so you likely understand why I tend to view overspecialization in a bad light.
        ```

        - u/None:
          ```
          I haven't actually read Outliers and I hadn't heard of Range. Thank you! One the specialize/generalize question, I think the common element both sides share is metaskills.  If you improve your skill-acquisition skills, you don't have to worry as much about how much time you devote to acquiring one skill versus another. Make Time and Better Faster Stronger are especially helpful there.

          My next project is the metaskill of working with other people - specifically the skill of productive disagreement. It's very hard.

    I think you'll love the manga/anime [Baby Steps](https://myanimelist.net/manga/8300/Baby_Steps). I'll copy the recommendation by a deleted user from a [previous monthly recommendation thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6lffd4/monthly_recommendation_thread/) (also check out other answers in that thread because they fit your ask even though the ask itself is deleted):

    > The main character starts practicing tennis out of a worry for his health and physical aptitude. He slowly climbs up the ranks using a combination of analyzing correct body movements, his opponent's strategy, and continuous training. This training part is actually an important theme in the story - he very diligently practices everything until he gets it perfectly right, sometimes spending hours on a single movement. He's taking a lot of notes about these things in his notebooks, and it's clearly explained what he's supposed to accomplish by this. Also, I think it subverted the usual sport anime tropes by applying real-life logic. It was some time ago when I last watched it, but it might even count as fully rational.

    Try also browsing through these older threads:

    Tentative rec for the boxing anime Hajime no Ippo, while not the main focus, there is definately a large focus on the main character, first learning how to box and then going on to develop his own style, the show does a really good job of showing his growth of skill, although it might not be enough of a focus for your liking

    - u/chiruochiba:
      ```
      On the topic of Superman fanfiction, [Lex Luthor Triumphant](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8700173/1/Lex-Luthor-Triumphant) might be a better fit for this request. In "Metropolitan Man" Lex's actions are 'moral' insofar as he consistently acts upon utilitarian motives, whereas in "Lex Luthor Triumphant" he has no such limits and is only motivated by his own self-interest. Both are great fics with surprising moments of [villain has a point](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainHasAPoint).

  - u/None:
    ```
    Have you read [Twig](https://twigserial.wordpress.com/) yet? Sylvester has *some* form of morals, but they basically boil down to "protect my friends, don't hurt children". Given that they're usually sent to some war zone or another as kid spies, that leaves him *a lot* of leeway to cause mayhem with his social manipulation abilities and penchant for firebombing.

    It takes a while for him to develop his goal, like more than a third of the book. The beginning is a bit meander-y and reads like a "monster of the week" TV show, but they do contribute to the plot and worldbuilding.

  I've got two requests:

  Stories about exploring interesting mechanics (probably, but not necessarily, magic). Something like [Break Them All](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/break-them-all-original-precross.12960/).

  Stories that actively explore the nature of "narrative", or have other meta-narrative elements. Some stories that fit the bill here are [The Library Unpublished](https://archiveofourown.org/works/11539230/chapters/25908498), [A Practical Guide to Evil](https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com) (wherein stories are just part of the way the universe works), [Worth The Candle](https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/25740126) fits the bill to a lesser degree. [The Simulacrum](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/23173/the-simulacrum) tries to fit in here, but (at least as of chapter 17) hasn't really delivered all that well for me.
  ```

  - u/RetardedWabbit:
    ```
    For your second request:
    I highly recommend: "Shadows of the Limelight" by AlexanderWales. It's a perfect match if you haven't read it, and really gets into meta-elements.
    http://alexanderwales.com/shadows-of-the-limelight-ch-1-the-rooftop-races/

    I much less strongly recommend Wildbow's "Pact", it's a supernatural action thriller where magic is strongly based on narrative.Theatrics, personhood, and consistency add strength to your actions and the rule of 3 is hugely important for example. I'm not a big fan, I prefer more concrete powers and the overall tone didn't appeal to me, but you might enjoy it. There's also a read along podcast, Deep In Pact, and the Pact audiobook project (not very far).
    ```

    - u/TacticalTable:
      ```
      > I much less strongly recommend Wildbow's "Pact"

      Seconding this half-recommendation. The mechanics of the world are fascinating early on, and a lot of interesting tools and symbolism are set up. Then you keep going, >!and going, and going, and realize you've been in this endless state of high tension/combat, for all 950k words, and half of the combat feels like an asspull to just let the story end. Really felt like a step back from Worm's structure and rigidity. !<

  It's very late and I'm writing this on my phone so please bare with me.

  I just stumbled upon a short (by web novel standards, 42k words) fiction called Twin.

  https://archiveofourown.org/works/14758049?view_full_work=true

  It's a cross between the universes of Hetalia and Twig. If you know anything about those two fictions, you can tell immediately that the product is going to be very interesting.

  Hetalia literal country in human form plus Twig Mad Science gone extreme, spice it up with total war, and what could go wrong. Apparently, a lot. I personally haven't read or watched either of those but it's not needed beyond the bare minimum.

  I'll leave the very excellent summary/hook and subsequent trigger warning here.

  >Once upon the time, the United States of America won his independence from Great Britain.

  >Once upon a time, the Crown Empire reclaimed his colony.

  >Once upon a time, the Crown States of America put pen to paper and began to write.

  >They say that those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.

  > This is a crossover involving the characters of Hetalia in the world of the web serial [Twig](https://twigserial.wordpress.com/). It contains spoilers for the entirety of Twig.

  >Twig contains many instances or mentions of war, violence, sickness, body horror, massacres, and various other terrible things I have likely forgotten to mention; while I will not write graphic descriptions of any of these, dark themes are present throughout the setting and will be present here as well.

  ```
  The recent episode of *We want MoR* reminded me that I’ve barely read HP fan fiction where the MC is a Hufflepuff, with jacobk’s *HuffPuff Quest* being the sole exception. Are there any recommendations?
  ```

  - u/hwc:
    ```
    “What's Her Name in Hufflepuff,” by ashez2ashes.
    ```

    - u/general_enthusiast:
      ```
      I'd second that recommendation, it's very well written and a lot of fun to read. The protagonist has a lot of investment in minor, personal goals as well as major ones, which really breathes life into story.
      ```

  ```
  Does anyone have any recommendations for a good rational naruto fiction? I have enjoyed the ones in the wiki and am looking for something new.

    Bunch of rational Naruto fics on [this list](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cn-yJ4dalKUXpbQ4XMlmIFOOLkKAGaNTWEBy5T5-0QA/edit). Not sure if it includes everything.
    ```

  - u/GreatSwordsmith:
    ```
    Not sure if Naruto: Need to Become Stronger is on the wiki or not, but if you haven't read it, it's very good, and very rational. Hands down best world building I've read in a Naruto fanfic, and the characters are all different enough from their Canon counterparts that everything feels fresh, but there's no jarring difference in genre between the characters as in waves arisen.
    ```

- u/Watchful1:
  ```
  Any recommendations for stories where characters split their minds or mind to mind combat plays a major part? I enjoyed Time Braid and that authors other big story Indomitable. I also enjoyed [Ra](https://qntm.org/ra) which had elements of it in some of the combat scenes.

    [Crystal Society](http://crystal.raelifin.com/society) [RT][HSF] by /u/Raelifin - follows an AGI that unbeknown to researchers is split into multiple "minds" as they fight/cooperate for dominance within and outside to fulfil their utility functions.

    ```
    [Gnomon](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33852053-gnomon) has elements of this.
    ```

- u/Ateddehber:
  ```
  I would recommend the Gentlemen Bastards series by Scott Lynch. The world feels incredibly fleshed out and vibrant and the characters are very well established and fascinating.
  ```

- u/Nickless314:
  ```
  I'm looking for recommendations for stories that have a mediocre beginning, but are overall very good.

  My logic for asking is that Iv'e been ~~lurking~~ here long enough to have probably tried the beginning of most recommendations, and so I hope to find a hidden gem. For example, I find the beginning of [Dungeon Keeper Amy](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/dungeon-keeper-ami-sailor-moon-dungeon-keeper-story-only-thread.30066/) to be unreadable, while the story overall is excellent.

  Regarding genre, I personally dislike horror and worm/MLP fanfics, but maybe others will find such recommendations useful, so anything goes.

  \[I might re-post this Monday when the thread is still active.\]
