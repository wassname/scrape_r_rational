  Oh heck yes. So much shit hitting so many fans I don't know where to squeegee first.

  1. Alaya and Amadeus had quite the reunion. For most of the story they've been able to move and assume that despite the other's mistakes, they were both on the same side. No more, and it's great.

  2. The coronation was great, but nothing really stuck out to me until the Wild Hunt showed up. Don't think that's Cat's name, even if it'd be cool. Anyone else think putting Akua's soul into an article of clothing Cat wears daily might be a dumb idea? I think it's a dumb idea.

  3. I really hope Cordelia manages to achieve some of her goals, I really like her character.

  4. Nice to see Anaxares taking some action. Even nicer to see the Bard actually being thrown for a loop. Her statements about deals and the way she talks about the gods above *and* below have some super interesting implications. Maybe she's not as Heroic as we thought... Although I have to say I still don't like the Tyrant as a character. 

  5. Dead king getting ready to START SOME SHIT LET'S GET PUMPED FOR BOOK 4

    >The coronation was great, but nothing really stuck out to me until the Wild Hunt showed up.

    There's a few sentences that might mean something in the long run, though most of it is probably red herrings. This is definitely a chapter that we'll have to revisit halfway through book 4 to find it reads very differently.

    >The Governess-General, he knew, was nearly as influential as the queen in some parts. If not more. Chancellor in all but Name, men whispered.

    Note the capital N. The Name of Chancellor has only ever been used in this serie to describe the right-hand of the Dread Emperor/Empress. The crown of Callow isn't the one people expect to see on Catherine's head by the end of it all.

    >The Grandmaster was one of the few of his people high enough in rank to understand what was being built, though. A war machine unlike any he had ever seen. Callow was being put on war footing long before the first blade left the sheath.

    We get confirmation that Cat is preparing for the greatest war of them all. She's reforging the Knightly Orders and raising her own Legions. With the later revelation that she's discussing with Procer, this could go a million ways.

    >That governors no longer paid taxes directly to the Tower or even the short-lived Ruling Council had thrown the old system into disarray

    Not sure how relevant that will be, but Callow has basically broken with the Tower and taken independance. Malicia doesn't seem to consider this a breach of the new contract though.

    >A saying was born of it that had Grandmaster Talbot shivering every time he heard the words: crowned by dread and cloaked by woe.

    Setting aside the choice of words referring to the Fifteenth and the Woe, Catherine is widely perceived as a decidedly Evil woman. She is being crowned Queen of Callow (a historically Good nation) by the House of Light, while wearing the full regalia of a Villain. Apparently, the people are largely okay with it, if not wholeheartedly approving. This has the taste of a Pivot.
    ```

    - u/Keyenn:
      ```
      I think it's more "the governors pay tribute to the crown, and then, the crown pays tribute to the Tower". Something like that. So Callow is not completely independant, but Cat is still at the top and can declares independance any day.
      ```

    > Her statements about deals and the way she talks about the gods above and below have some super interesting implications. Maybe she's not as Heroic as we thought...

    Stories are a piece of magical infrastructure that enforces the nature of reality in this world. Every fucked up, awful thing that happens in part happens because of the nature of stories and of Names. Bard is a maintainer, replicator, and refiner of stories. 

    She's not a piece on the cosmic shatranj board. She's the referee.
    ```

    - u/haiku_fornification:
      ```
      > She's not a piece on the cosmic shatranj board. She's the referee.

      She's more of a player than a referee. 

      She's often directing stories to suit her own purposes (like with Black and Akua) and she clearly has her own agenda. In fact, in this chapter Anaxares set her up as his antagonist so I would say she's very much involved in the game as an active participant.
      ```

      - u/Oaden:
        ```
        to Quote Anaraxes "I know you, old thing. You are the sound of the lash, the deal in the dark. You are the servant of stillness. I deny all you peddle." which apart from being a very badass statement, is also really interesting 

        He calls her Servant of Stillness, i guess this refers to motion, rather than sound. As in the Bard keeps the game going, but not ever actually changing. She does have an agenda, but currently the agenda seems to be "killing the calamities" who are breaking the game. At any cost, be that sacrificing a few heroes, allying with a Tyrant, the calamities must die, the game must go on.

        Hierarch (I'm just gonna call him that) pisses her off cause he isn't picking a side, which is inexplicably even more game breaking than what the calamities are doing, plus also really fucking bizarre.

    I agree this would be bad idea, and I think the rumors about Akua's soul are distraction and Cat did something different with her soul.

    >Anyone else think putting Akua's soul into an article of clothing Cat wears daily might be a dumb idea? I think it's a dumb idea.

    Yeah, this seems like the sort of Chekov's Gun that backfires. Very traditionally villainous move, complete with a window for comeuppance you could fly a zombie horse through. Not to mention that that cloak was massive hero bait even before the soul.
    ```

    - u/Zayits:
      ```
      The Rainbow Cloak isn't hero bait because it wasn't used publicly yet (whatever its final effects are). 

      The soul might well backfire, though, if it can actually speak to people. Not sure what are the rules for soul binding, anyway.
      ```

      - u/CeruleanTresses:
        ```
        The reason I think it's hero bait is because it's A. macabre as fuck and B. a villain's signature garment. A cloak like that exists to flutter dramatically to the ground, probably from the top of the Tower, after Cat is obliterated by holy light or some shit. Or maybe to be hoisted as a flag of victory over her dread regime.
        ```

- u/sparkc:
  ```
  I had doubts this story could maintain its high standard at three chapters a week, especially when the quality dipped last time this happened, but if anything the ending of Book 3, from the Killian chapter onwards, has been nothing but outstanding. 

  One of the things I miss most about HPMOR is just how great the Crowning Moments of Awesome were and this story is the closest I’ve found at recreating such moments, and this book had those moments feel more earnt and more satisfying than even the previous two. A well developed build up that really paid off.
  ```

- u/momanie:
  ```
  I rarely comment on threads like these but I felt this chapter was to important not to give my insights so here we go...  

  1. The conversation between Black and Malicia was interesting in a couple ways, first was how deeply Malicia cared for black, she was willing to forgive him quite easily, on top of that I think a lot of people overestimated how strong/smart Malicia is, that's not to say I think shes dumb but I don't think shes as amazing as everyone thought. Finally black's final quote was very interesting when he talked about the world Cat was going to make, it seemed like he was giving it considerable thought. Oh and I forgot, it seems warlock isn't as loyal as we thought he was considering he wasn't going to back Black on his decision with the soul weapon thingy.  

  2. The coronation wasn't all that exciting until the end which was very unexpected when the Prince of Nightfall showed up, i'm a little disappointed because we still don't know what the meaning behind Cat giving him the crowns from kings thing was about, or what the consequences would have been. Though I think this is something that no one foresaw, and on top of that we know that the prince of Nightfall was incredibly powerful but he now recognizes Cat as queen and Cat believed she could take him in a fight, that shows that Cat getting to the upper echelons of power levels, I wouldn't say shes on ranger's level yet but shes getting their. The main problem with her power up is that she is at a HUGE disadvantage when facing bard, who knows the stories like the back of her hand so the power is both a blessing an a curse it would seem.

  3. We all knew a crusade was going to happen, it's been foreshadowed since the first book, this includes heroes being involved in it so their wasn't much surprise in this part of the Epilogue. I'm not all that surprised Catherine is talking to Procer, she wants to stop her country from being ravaged by another war, but what these negotiations bring about will be interesting to see. I would have been more surprised if it was bard who went to talk to Procer instead though tbh.  

  4. The people the Hierarch saw in order I think were Malicia, which is even more interesting considering that she showed a moment of weakness an cried, this even furthers my own personal opinion that Malicia really isn't all the scary of an opponent in my eyes, at least from what we know of her. The knight and champion were the white knights squad joining up with other heroes who were old to partake in the upcoming crusade. The Girl on the throne is Cat. I believe the fields of hell would be the Dead Kingdom, I could be wrong though which is interesting because it shows that the dead king might be entering the great game soon, and if that happens then this is escalating even more than I thought it was going to. Knives bared with black and green would be goblins or maybe the drow of the everdark, I don't think we've seen one yet so who knows. Green Eyed man is obviously black. Then the augur and Hierarch saw one another. It's also interesting to note that it would seem the Hierarch can look at anyone, anywhere including the tower would she be warded to kingdom fucking come, but their has to be some kind of catch or condition to this ability I would assume. That part was intersting but was even more interesting is that the Bard can make names and it would appear she is as old as we previously thought. Also interesting to note that bard made a mistake in making the Name Hierarch and I wonder why. Also we knew that bard sometimes interacted with the gods occasionally, but the fact that she knows that the gods above and below are worried about the Hierarch really is cementing her as one of if not the main antagonists in my eyes. She's like the grand string puller of them all, though it would seem Kairos is moving on par with her. When I first saw Kairos I thought, "oh a villain thats gonna be really evil but not all that smart", but what we got is someone who seems to know more about this game than anyone else with the exception of Bard.   

  5. I wonder what the stone is and what the dead king is going to do with it. It would seem my suspicions above were correct and that the dead king is now moving his pieces onto the board which is probably going to shake everyone up except maybe Kairos, I have a feeling he's anticipated this in some fashion, or maybe Malicia might have something to do with it since it may have something to do with Triumphant. I don't really have much thoughts on what the stone could do except something to do with Malicia honestly, actually maybe that's why she was crying, she was calling on the dead king as a last resort or something, hmm...

  Extra thoughts on the series:  I wonder how this is gonna be wrapped up in 2 books, I feel like their is so much left to explore besides the crusades, dead king, and kairos. We still have much to learn about the everdark, elves, dwarves, gnomes, and other countries/continents that are much larger then the one we currently know about.
  ```

  - u/werafdsaew:
    ```
    I believe the stone is a communications device, and it shone because Malicia is calling to make a deal.  This possibility was talked about before in "Villainous Interlude: Decorum", where Black mentioned the Tower was in communication with the Kingdom of the Dead, but the price would be too high.  And here Malicia talked about taking measures necessary for survival that Black would not approve of.
    ```

    - u/Zayits:
      ```
      Given that it's called "an old and treasured gift", it's definitely from Triumphant.
      ```

    - u/sickening_sprawl:
      ```
      I don't think that's right. It's mentioned that the stone hasn't been lit since Triumphant. If the Tower was using it for communication, and has been in communication with the Kingdom of the Dead, then it would have been lit since then. It sounds like Triumphant really is coming back...
      ```

      - u/Empiricist_or_not:
        ```
        Summoning Triumphant would qualify as a Measure Black would not approve of; I'm not sure if it's reasonable as a necessary measure, but it would probably endure survival.
        ```

        - u/HeWhoBringsDust:
          ```
          Pretty sure summoning Triumphant is one of those things that basically assures everyone on the continent will hate your guts for the rest of eternity and throws decorum and honor out the window. This goes way way past super weapon and into “what the actual flying fuck are you thinking?!?!” territory. Along with that, it’s also the quickest way to lose power as I’m pretty sure Triumphant would want her throne back
          ```

      - u/TideofKhatanga:
        ```
        Or maybe none of the Dread Emperors since Triumphant have been quite crazy or desperate enough to contact the Dead King. It's a possibility, though not a likely one considering the folks we're discussing.
        ```

    ~~RE 2, I think you're confusing the Prince of Nightfall with the King of Winter, (now of the combined Fae) who was the one Cat swore to.~~

    Edited. I'm wrong

    >  I believe the fields of hell would be the Dead Kingdom, 

    It referenced seemingly human people farming who had lived there for generations and not seen the sun. Dead king seems to exclusively have undead subjects, so I interpret it as possibily Triumphant's kingdom in the Hells. (Maybe the abandoned Legionaries would meet up with them?)

    Wrapping up this story doesn't necessariy mean wrapping up the setting as a whole. In a similar way to how Wildbow ended Taylor's story in Worm but brought bac teh world for Ward

      Erraticerrata [stated](https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2017/01/04/epilogue-2/#comment-3569) that at least the huge elven kingdom across the sea wouldn't be in the story, so at least Cat's story is probably confined to Calernia.

    Eh, I liked it. It's nice to have some worldbuilding from the point of view of the minions and the "bystanders" of the story.
    ```

    - u/Zayits:
      ```
      Agree, it's stuff like this that allows author to set up little details like Cat being called first countess Foundling, then a duchess and Black Queen at last as her power grew, or that people are throwing attractive representatives of both genders at her now that it's obvious that she's free game.
      ```

  - u/Zayits:
    ```
    > Oh and I forgot, it seems warlock isn't as loyal as we thought he was considering he wasn't going to back Black on his decision with the soul weapon thingy.

    Well, those are two of his oldest friends arguing over a matter he holds in disdain.

    > The main problem with her power up is that she is at a HUGE disadvantage when facing bard, who knows the stories like the back of her hand so the power is both a blessing an a curse it would seem.

    Given the nature of her current power and how much Catherine swears, I hope her new Name would be something along the lines of "Cursed" (except a ruler one and not transitional), and one of her Aspects would be Swear that would allow her to put limitations on before going into her fae form (with a handicap of, say, only three oaths at a time).

    > Also we knew that bard sometimes interacted with the gods occasionally, but the fact that she knows that the gods above and below are worried about the Hierarch really is cementing her as one of if not the main antagonists in my eyes.

    I think by not really human she might mean the beings with more agency like the angelic choirs, Dead King and the nonhuman nations, or maybe the ones she really hates, like Malicia.

    Also, may I gush for a second about how bloody awesome was Anaxares in exiling Bard out of existence? Her fault, obviously, for ignoring the favor he did for her, then tempting him, then threatening him despite not being allowed to directly involve herself in the story, but still.

    > I don't really have much thoughts on what the stone could do except something to do with Malicia honestly, actually maybe that's why she was crying, she was calling on the dead king as a last resort or something, hmm...

    Yeah, most likely. Remember how Triumphant was said to rule *all of Calernia*, save for Golden Bloom, which was out of Creation at the moment? No way she took over the Kingdom of the Dead and nobody mentioned it in the story yet as her greatest achievment; she must have had some treaty with Trismegistus.
    ```

    - u/HeWhoBringsDust:
      ```
      Hmm, on the topic of Cat’s name, what about “the Unbound”? It’s neutral (fitting with her party’s themes) and fits well with her story, along with the fact that she’s slowly leaving the restraints of the narrative
      ```

      - u/M3mentoMori:
        ```
        Giving Cat a Name that reflects her escaping the narrative seems completely self-defeating. Roles and Names come from the narrative, after all.
        ```

        - u/HeWhoBringsDust:
          ```
          Hm, fair point. What about something simple like “Queen”. Not “Black Queen”, not “Dead Queen”, not “Winter Queen” but just “Queen”. Something less than the others as it has no qualifiers, but also more than the others as she is free to do what she wishes without the weight of previous stories on her shoulders. It would also play in nicely with how she appears to be a successor to Malicia instead of Black (As she outright rejected Black, and she seems fated to take the Tower at some point)
          ```

          - u/M3mentoMori:
            ```
            I'm leaning toward Tyrant, or a completely unexpected name, at this point. What Cat has done in the name of Callow's safety, and the 'Governess is Chancellor in all but Name' bit both fit the former, and Cat's inherited disdain for the narrative makes the latter always a possibility.

            I hope we see Cat's new Name before the end of B4; I can't take the suspense anymore lol
            ```

            - u/HeWhoBringsDust:
              ```
              Tyrant seems too “Evil” for Cat as it doesn’t really mesh well with the theme her current team has of having names with ambiguous morality (I.e. Adjutant, Thief, Hierophant, Archer). While it definitely fits with her themes and her story, there’s also the tiny issue of there already being a Tyrant, and I doubt he’s going to die any time soon.

              Also, the note about Chancellor makes me almost thinks that Cat’s equivalent will be something like “Advisor”. Something Neutral.

              Hmm, what if she starts off as Queen (I mean, Book 3 is literally her climbing through the ranks going from Countess to Duchess to Vice-Queen and now Queen) but eventually become “Empress”. Not “Dread Empress”, but just “Empress” thereby making it clear that she’s broken standard story conventions.
              ```

              - u/M3mentoMori:
                ```
                >there’s also the tiny issue of there already being a Tyrant, and I doubt he’s going to die any time soon.

                IIRC, Malicia is also Tyrant. They share an aspect, at the least (Rule). I don't think we've gotten confirmation that all Names can't have multiple bearers.

                >Hmm, what if she starts off as Queen (I mean, Book 3 is literally her climbing through the ranks going from Countess to Duchess to Vice-Queen and now Queen) but eventually become “Empress”.

                That looks to be what's happening, unless EE pulls another 'foreshadow something, then derail it'.

                  Not sure where, but I’m pretty sure at one point it’s explicitly stated that Alaya came into the Name of Dread Empress. I mean, Dread Emperor/Empress makes sense as Praes has a lot of narrative weight in the grand scheme of things. Along with that, I’m pretty sure Tyrant is exclusive to Helike as whenever Helike is mentioned, Tyrants are mentioned soon after and it’s clear that Tyrants are closely associated with Helike.

                  Also, I’m pretty sure Names can’t have multiple bearers as in the first book Cat and a few other Claimants for the Name of Squire have to duke it out to prove that they have “claim” over the name. However, we do know that Aspects aren’t exclusives to Names and can be shared. Cat has **Learn** at the same time Range does for example, so it’s likely that the “Ruler” Names (I.e. Tyrant, Dread Empress, Good King) can have **Rule** as a Aspect.

                  >That looks to be what's happening, unless EE pulls another 'foreshadow something, then derail it'.

                  This seems highly likely and I’m honestly expecting shit to hit the fan so hard that Cat ends up going in a wildly different direction. Who knows, maybe the Dead King will be destroyed and Cat can take his Name, but I find that unlikely

                  As far as I'm aware Tyrant is a title (not a Name) given to the ruler of the Dread Empire, similar to Cat having a noble title after she was given Marchford. It was mentioned when Cat was first introduced to the Praesi court:

                  > All kneel for Her Most Dreadful Majesty Malicia, First of Her Name, Tyrant of Dominions High and Low, Holder of the Nine Gates, Sovereign of All She Beholds

    She's smart, but she's working with limited resources. Unlike Black and Cat she doesn't have directly offensive powers, she has to manipulate people and succeed by ruling. She's in a position where she's got progressively fewer resources due to the rebellions, and is facing a major threat, so her options are becoming more limited, and she cant just brute force ehr way out

  > It is flawed. The Wasteland has made a religion out of mutilating itself. We speak of it with pride. Gods, iron sharpens iron? We have grown so enamoured with bleeding our own we have sayings about it. Centuries ago, field sacrifices were a way to fend off starvation. Now they are a staple of our way of life, so deeply ingrained we cling to them given alternative. Alaya, we consistently blunder so badly we need to rely on demons to stay off destruction. We would rather irreparably damage the fabric of Creation than admit we can be wrong. There is nothing holy about our culture, it needs to be ripped out root and stem as matter of bare survival

  Sometimes I love this story.

  I think that Black is planning to betray Malicia. He says "It’s strangely invigorating. To have every plan you ever made ripped apart." I think he's come to terms with the fact that Malicia isn't going to deviate from the pattern of "Defect, defect, defect, OH SHIT EVERYONE IS PISSED AT ME NOW", and that he has to make new plans centered more around Catherine.

  I'm actually really pissed at Malicia myself. She's acting almost narcissistically here. "Black, because of what you did I have to face actual consequences when I decide to be complicit in the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of people! And how dare you undermine the plans I very obviously made behind your back because I knew you wouldn't approve of them? It's almost like lying about sensitive matters to my most important lieutenants is a bad idea!"

  Otherwise, the much hypes crusade is on its way. I'm still unclear on the logistics of it, since, as pointed out by the generals, Catherine can teleport armies anywhere she wants, out of any ambush and into enemy capitals, which means she's basically invincible against non-named, and White Knight only takes them so far.

    I also dont like the development of Malicia. While she was originaly portraited as kind of intelligent villian trying to break free of narative, I feel that with gambit with flying fortress she kind kind of screwed it all up. Super weapon destroyed, crusade imminent, closest assest antagonized and desperate measures on the way. It going to go downhill from here.
    ```

    - u/HeWhoBringsDust:

      Also, the trust between Catherine and Black is gone, meaning that the one thing keeping her loyal to Praes is also gone.
      ```

      - u/signeti:
        ```
        Yeah I find it highly hypocritical, that Malicia is complaining to Black, that he did not instill any loyalties into Cat, when it was her actions, that destroyed them in first place.
        ```

        - u/PrettyDecentSort:
          ```
          Not hypocritical at all. "Your job is to build a leash that won't snap when I tug it." The fact that the loyalty is one-way does not make it hypocritical. Honest relationships can be asymmetric, especially among villains.

  Black is going to kill Malicia. 

  I think the strange smile is the one Robber remarked on, whenever Black or Cat are planning to murder someone. Could it be that stabbing Black didn't only sever Cat's apprenticeship but also branded his Name, like what she did with The Lone Swordsman?

  Such a good epilogue.

  The fight between Black and Malicia was great and is not over yet, Black swore we was going to purge the Wasteland and i dont think he will back down.

  Cat was ascended to Mab as the Queen of Air and Darkness, is that a Name Name? The coronation and fae delegation had me truly laughing as an overload of awesome. It belongs as one of the moments of awesome in the series, also Akua was turned into clothing.

  The crusade is officially comming and Cat is speaking with the mastermind behind it. ^^^^^(I ^^^^love ^^^^u ^^^^Thief)

  Did the Hierarch bureaucracyed the Bard into leaving his story forever? also he has the hability to work as a augur-lite, but he does not believe in his own powers because he is crazy.

  So many things happening, will the author take a break?

  My bets on the futur:

  -Malicia completely lost it, and thinks her situation is salvageable. She is still playing words games when they are far beyond that. It's not salvageable at all (lost too much of her army, no more Black Knight, no more Calamities), and she will do the "old evil gambit" aka doing a shitty thing which will backfire (maybe the Dead King, maybe something else)

  -Black will kill Malicia, Cat becomes Empress, and Black becomes Cat's new Black Knight.

  -Hanno will judge Cat, and the Heavens will find her non-guilty. He becomes Cat's White Knight.

  Starting from there, the Pattern will more or less break, with Bard being the final incarnation of the famous:

  >“When heroes and villains come knocking in the name of fate,” I spoke, tone calm and measured. “When they try to drag us back to where we were by force with a Choir behind them or the host of some howling Hell – I’ll kill them all. Every last one of them.”

  And we can also add the fact the last declaration of Hierarch is very close to Cat's declaration above, so he will probably ally with Cat at some point, they share the same views (Unlike Kairos).

  >“You are mad,” the Bard said. “And putting a knife to your own throat. They will take you apart.”

  >“If the Heavens seek to impose their will, they will be made to stand before a tribunal of the People,” the Hierarch serenely said.

  >“Your own fucking Gods will bleed you like a pig,” the Wandering Bard hissed.

  >“Then they, too, will be hanged,” Anaxares noted. “As honorary citizens of the Republic, they are subject to its laws.”

  no idea what's going on. kinda feel like the "practical" aspect was just thrown out the window so I guess we're GUIDE TO EVIL now, which is fine with me

    The "practical" aspect of Malicia was thrown out by the window, yep. But Cat is still there, and Black as well.

      I think Hierarch and Cordelia might be Practical Neutral and Practical Good

  Also, some might have forgotten, but the Queen of Arcadia had granted free passage to Cat *and everyone under her command*. So Larat just got free passage to whatever point of Arcadia he needs for his personal goals, and Cat got unlimited amount of gates trough it.

  The true question is, just how flexible that power is? The opening of gates was shown to have at least some limitations related to the ownership of the place they lead to, so she can't just pop up in Forever King's throne room and stab him in the back, but how much power does the Court of Arcadia hold over the parts that elves occupy? How do the inherent domains of the elves interact with Arcadia and the fae domains, other than being able to negate one creational law at a time?
  ```

  - u/werafdsaew:

    Larat was already a fae and could go anywhere in Arcadia controlled by the combined court.

  - u/CouteauBleu:
    ```
    Was I the only one wondering what are the logistics of sending a musician to intimidate a high ranking noble? If nothing else, you probably need a musician with real nerves of steel.

    And yeah, that was a nice Game of Thrones reference.
    ```

    - u/panchoadrenalina:
      ```
      i this case i dont think the musician must fear much, if he as much a touches the hair of one of her official envoys is signing a death certificate on yourself. 

      if you are scary enough that sending a minstel as a treat works, you scaryness a nice warranty for your mooks

  I might have figured out why the Dead King is so happy about getting a call from the Tower.

  Remember how, in Regard, he was waiting for Ranger on the *other* side of the portal, and she remarked that he could change the place it led to because he owned the entire hell? Ever since one of Akua's interludes mentioned that she had to circumvent the issue of Keter's Due to stay human, I've been thinking that this was the reason Trismegistus transitioned into the Name of the Dead King, but now I think that wasn't the only consequence.

  For a villain, undeath is a net loss. Sure, you can make phylacteries and other stuff incompatible with life, but the core purpose of it, escaping the inevitable death by old age, is already achieved by being a villain. As Warlock remarked, undeath makes one less able to change, which is damning in the long run, which makes me wonder: if subjugating a hell had him becoming nonhuman enough to suffer fae-like setbacks in his capacity to learn, just how close is he bound to it?

  See, the little detail that made me remind you all that was this little passage from the end of the epilogue:

  > In the depths of a Hell that had long lost its name and number, a monster opened his eyes. In Keter, a stone that was an old and treasured gift shone red. It had not done this since the days of Dread Empress Triumphant.

  Now, if Akua's dimension-scrying artifact and Hierarch's Receive are any indication, there's nothing fundamentally impossible for magic and Names in connecting directly to the other dimensions. But why would the lich and the stone be separated if it were a simple communication device? Surely someone as acquainted with the Hells as Triumphant could make a device that could allow direct calls? More importantly, is there any significance in the fact that both times we've seen the Dead King he was in his hell? He's undead, it's not like the poisoned air and the undead armies in Keter would hinder him.

  My theory is that claiming a hell and making it lose its name and number bound Trismegistus to it. It's why he needs all those intermediaries in the varying states of decay and sentience: he can't set the foot in the Creation himself. Triumphant, on the other hand, had made her armies out of denizens of Hells; she also probably made some deal with the lich, given how fond he is of her and how nobody mentioned conquering the Kingdom of the Dead as her greatest achievement. What if this deal included *summoning* him?
  ```

- u/ketura:
  ```
  Aww. The Dead King has spent this whole time waiting for another candidate for his Dead Queen. How romantic.
  ```

  - u/signeti:
    ```
    I would actually really like for Cat to look for some unexpected allies (Dead King, Everdark, King Under etc). It would also bring opportinity to explore more in that world.
    ```

- u/narfanator:
  ```
  Triumphant is totally coming back, with the part of the Fifteenth that Warlock stranded in the Hells. 

  I will also bet that, regardless as to whether or not they end up as allies, Cat tries to burn her with far too much goblin fire and it just doesn't take.
  ```

  - u/Empiricist_or_not:
    ```
    I'll take that second bet. $5 at 1:1 on cat (or her forces) trying to burn Triumphant with goblin fire and it not working?
    ```

  Chapter 34 epigraph:

  This chapter:
  >A mistake had been made, in placing blind trust. The extent that leaning should ever be indulged was in trusting individuals to act according to their nature. 

  I doubt that was a coincidence.

  Just in case no one else noticed.

  - u/Zayits:

    Well, some epigraphs used (mostly the memoirs) are from the future. Maybe that was a quote from some coming speech of Malicia or something.
