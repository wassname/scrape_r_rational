## Story prompt: Subsidized

### Post:

You're being subsidized.
Okay, that's not what the letter you got today says, but the thought occurs to you after you realize it's not a scam. 
The US government has decided to offer you, as a citizen, what is effectively a one year trial of Guaranteed Basic Income. You'll be part of a carefully monitored group of individuals given a monthly allowance equal to the median income of whatever city "in which you are currently located." Just the median income, not matched to age, gender, race, nothing except the locality. You made sure to read that paragraph carefully, and it really didn't mean city of residence after all. You can go anywhere, and your monthly allowance will be adjusted to your location automatically whenever you attempt a transaction from the account they give you. They'll monitor your location by GPS, using an app they will install on your phone - and if your phone doesn't support it, they'll give you any phone you choose that does. 
You read a lot about monitoring in this offer letter. Your social media presence, your transactions, GPS location, cash withdrawals over $100. And they require an opening interview, at the start of the process, and a closing interview at the end of the year. And you'll sign a non-disclosure agreement and stay inside the US at all times, of course.
So. You're being subsidized for a year as part of a trial to learn what people would do with Guaranteed Basic Income. You can go anywhere, do anything (unless you run out of money for the month and that "anything" has a price tag.) They'll watch and learn, but you can do anything you want on the government's dime if it's within the law and the contract. You put the letter down, and then - 
Then what do you do?

  joking answer:

  I put down the letter and seriously re-evaluate some core beliefs I currently hold about the government, especially in the areas of its willingness to help its citizens and willingness to conduct experiments and accept evidence.

  more serious answer:

  I look for an inexpensive dev bootcamp in an area where [median income for that city] >= [cost of living]. with a list found, applications pour out, then move and attend. within half a year, I'd have a better, permanent job in a better area.

  There's really three ways for me to approach the situation, given my current financial situation (comfortable) and political preferences (highly in favor of a program similar to this, even if I don't personally need to benefit from it).

  Realistic: I would move to a nicer condo in downtown Chicago, and otherwise continue living my life as I currently do, including going to work, saving, etc. A program like this would cover the opportunity costs that are currently standing in the way of my doing this today, and since it's only a year long, I need to still have a job afterwards as well. 

  Charitable: I don't actually need any of the money, so I realistically should donate it to someone else or start my own program to fund two or more others in a lower cost of living area for the cost of my own area. This is less likely because I'm not currently especially charitable, but it's what I'd say I would do to give myself warm fuzzies.

  Munchkin: Try to discover what is required to create a new municipality. Create it, and then test what happens for the following situations: I set my salary as mayor equal to double the median salary of the town; if that doesn't work, I recruit foreign investors by offering to pay them 1.5x their current salary to live here, and spend half of my newly increased funds to do just this.

    Abusing a government trial is most certainly not a rational thing to do. Although munchkinry doesn't exclude being a complete asshole, I'd like to think even munchkins would think in the long term.
    ```

    - u/nicholaslaux:
      ```
      I agree, but I don't conflate munchkinry with rationality. I more think of it as maximizing personal potential, ignoring all other factors. The ultimate chaotic neutral.

        I think this is classic Munchkin behavior. Abusing the Rules As Written, pretending there are no Powers That Be to enforce balance on the universe when the written rules break down.

        I like how you staged your multiple answers.

  My first thought is that the government has gone insane. This experimental model is terrible. The NDA is never going to work; even if I don't do it, someone else in the group is going to anonymously leak the contract. If they're really selecting randomly, and their sample size is large enough to be meaningful, they're going to get someone who's dead-set against GBI and wants to sink it. Further, you can't present someone with an offer and then have them sign an NDA as part of it, because if they refuse the offer they're not bound by the NDA. Either the government is having people sign an NDA *then* giving the offer, which means selecting for a certain type of person, or they're using the law in a highly unconventional way that I'd find pretty troubling. More worrying than the fact that the government is doing experimentation on its citizens is the fact that they're doing this in secret.

  So the experiment is probably going to end within the first few weeks, if not sooner. The costs associated with moving are so high that I can't actually change my location in order to take advantage of a place with a higher median income, and that's if I had any confidence that the experiment would last. There are also costs associated with quitting and starting a job, so I'm not really going to change my employment. Cost-of-living is highly associated with median income, so I don't really see much benefit in moving anyway, though I suppose I could run some numbers and figure out if there was a place I could move that's best on some income/cost index. (And I probably still don't move, because I've put down roots.)

  Keep on working, pay down my house note. I wouldn't move, it wouldn't gain me enough additional income to pay for the expenses and higher cost of living.

  I'm not sure this is the best sub for this since it's more a political question than a story question.  Most answers that people would give would not be story ones.

  At any rate, giving someone a trial of guaranteed basic income wouldn't work like the real thing.  For instance, if I had a minimum wage job, I might quit my job because GBI would allow me to hone my skills such that I can get a better one.  If the GBI is a trial and has an end point, it would be stupid for me to do this since the trial could end before I gained the skills and found a job.

  Also, much of the effect of GBI, both positive and negative, would happen because of how the market reacts to it.  For instance, minimum wage employers know that their employees will still be able to eat if they are fired, which affects how they treat their employees.  Since this is a trial and done in secret, and doesn't apply to most people anyway, that won't happen.

    A political question can also be a story question; some of my favorite stories are political in nature. It's not a terribly great story prompt because it encourages answers like, "I do X", which aren't really stories. A better prompt (if the aim is to get stories) would be, "The government begins running random trials on its citizens in secret through a 'dark' fund", because that's more broad and offers more possibilities. Even, "the government begins a trial with the following rules" would be more likely to get a story, because we wouldn't be penned in by having our protagonist and setting decided for us. (For example, my story would always have to start with a married 29-year-old software engineer living in Duluth who shares my values, unless I wanted to go off-prompt.)

    If I'm a test subject for a program that I believe would be worth implementing on a larger scale, then maybe I should try to be a *positive* example, a convincing test case. If my first actions are to try and figure out just how much extra money I can milk out of the government by exploiting loopholes, well...
    ```

    - u/daydev:
      ```
      This. I think this scenario has a big flaw in that it's temporary, so the subject knows that after a year of free government money it's back to usual. So there's an incentive to milk as much as possible out of this situation, 'cause it's not gonna last.

    >There are municipalities where the median income is much higher than the actual cost of living because of very small populations of very wealthy individuals.

    No, there aren't. The whole point of using median instead of mean is that it removes outlier effects.

    > There are municipalities where the median income is much higher than the actual cost of living because of very small populations of very wealthy individuals. 

    Heavy outliers weigh down the *mean*, not the median.  Or at least, they weight it down less.

  What? *What*? 

  I'm attending college right now! My experiences will not be demonstrative of *anything* relative to the average citizen! Either I'll save it all or I'll spend it on random crap because my scholarship already takes care of my basic needs. 

  Alright. So I have an extra $26,000 (people don't make a lot over here, since half the population is college students). Uh... I'll see if maybe I can arrange to just take a year off and go down to San Francisco. That gives me an extra $53,000 (seems well worth it) and gives me the opportunity to establish residency there so that I can pay less tuition when I move on to getting a Master's. 

  And then... going to save a good portion of it, going to invest some of it in my writing, and (obviously) going to spend some on food and housing. I'll probably still save most of it. I can live off of $15,000 a year if I chop out all of the unimportant stuff, so if I save $40,000 then that still leaves me with enough for a (tight-ish) year in San Francisco, including enough to invest in my writing a little bit. 

  I still probably won't be a very good example of the average citizen.

  Is this guaranteed minimum income or basic income?

  If it's guaranteed minimum income, I shrug, refuse the offer, and go on with my business. I make more than my city's median salary, so a guaranteed minimum income wouldn't pay anything to me in my present job. It would allow me to drop my income by a large amount and gain back ~40 hours a week, but I can't afford that.

  If it's basic income, I shrug, accept the offer, and put the money into savings. It should see me retiring a year earlier.

  If it lasted for life rather than just one year, though, I would continue working but retire appreciably earlier. Or maybe I'd just take a few years off to work on my own projects. Yes, I'm boring.
