  Glad to gen seeing this again! I wonder what henge is playing at in the beginning, by faking those speech quirks? Trying to humanize himself?

  Welcome back, I'm happy to read again my favorite current  space story!

  Also Henge looks like a pretty cool guy, unless it's just pretending
  ```

    ```
    Not sure what it could gain by pretending. It already has control of just about everything, and it's clearly smart enough to know that the Reshapers are an existential threat. Whatever its utility function, it will almost certainly object to the entire solar system being strip-mined. Even a literal paperclip maximizer would take exception to that.

      It is employing psychological manipulation, to reduce the number of humans who resist its control.
