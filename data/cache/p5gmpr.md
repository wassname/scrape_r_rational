## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  Any Groundhog Day recommendations?  
  Stuff on the level of Mother of Learning, Time Braid or Purple Days? Where the characters fight against the same problem again and again discovering more at each iteration?

    Have you checked out [An Infinite Recursion of Time](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/43761/an-infinite-recursion-of-time) and [RE: Monarch](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/37951/re-monarch)? I've read the first, it's a fun ~~somewhat~~ rather nsfw loop that people keep saying has strong Worth the Candle inspiration. The second I've had recommended just haven't gotten round to reading it, reviews say it's like a darker Mother of Learning.

    Also reroll is pretty fun but not quite rational.

    Also also check out [The Flower that Bloomed Nowhere](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/28806/the-flower-that-bloomed-nowhere). It's an excellent time-wimey magical mystery in a rich well designed world with "contemplative" pacing.

    edit: Updated NSFW warning. Added Flower that Bloomed Nowhere

      the Worth the Candle references got reaaaaally on-the-nose a few chapters in.  It's basically a fanfic with the premise, "what if Worth the Candle was lurid, unrepentant edgy-teenage smut instead of literature?"

    I enjoyed [fate/first order derivative](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/fate-first-order-derivative-fsn.47581/), which is a loop featuring a bystander to the Holy Grail war in *Fate/stay night*. Since the original story already had three canon 'routes,' I found the story worked rather well for a groundhog day scenario. Unfortunately, it seems to be dead, but I didn't regret reading what was there.

    The only other one that's well done recently is the movie Edge of Tomorrow. One of my favorites.
    ```

    - u/echemon:
      ```
      Never watched the movie, but the book was good, and had a classic engrish name: *All You Need is Kill*.

      I think the designs of the aliens were more interesting in the book as well- from what I can see of the movie, they're big, lanky things, whereas in the book they're described as human-sized frog-like things full of what seems to be sand (nanomachines).

    [Branches on the Tree of Time](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9658524/1/Branches-on-the-Tree-of-Time) I originally got it from here, haven't seen it recommended in a while. Terminator Fanfiction, where the point of view does not change from the 'original' timeline. 

    Instead the MC commits to actions, and lives out the lives, sending back the results once time travel is possible, her children having been raised immediately land at a given point and time in her backyard to completely munchkin the Skynet situation. 

    It's interesting, and walks the balance I think between making the time travel an instant win and presenting the struggles and results of the iterative time looping. It's kind of dark considering the thousands of different lives she lived for singular goals to toss them aside and clip the branch to contribute to the main timeline.

    [The Best Night Ever](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/18087/the-best-night-ever) by Capn_Chryssalid.

    Warning for for ponies and all that. This is a groundhog day story in the mould of Groundhog Day - awful character earns redemption, while slowly grinding away at the problem of ensuring it is the best night ever. 

    There's a sequel called This Platinum Crown which, while good in its own right, is awful as a sequel and doesn't hit the same thematic notes at all. The Best Night Ever is Groundhog Day with ponies. The Platinum Crown is pony Game of Thrones.

  - u/CaramilkThief:
    ```
    [Reroll] (https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/37103/reroll) is a time loop story where the protagonist gets a new super power each iteration. The way this is balanced is that the protagonist is impulsive and not very smart, and has to rely on others almost entirely to win his battles. In fact, it's more that the antagonists and side characters are rational, and try to use the protagonist's power wisely. I liked it, although the protagonist did get grating at times.
    ```

    - u/jaghataikhan:
      ```
      Was just about to mention Reroll, sort of a cross between Worm x Mother of Learning... just not for the protagonist. 100% agree with the impulsive protag/ smart ally & antagonist take. 

      It's... ok. I'm glad I found it and binged it just as it was about to end (on Ch ~80 now of ~88 estimated), but it certainly won't ever be anywhere as memorable as Mother of Learning

    I found your old thread about RTS power fantasy when looking for more but wasnt able to reply since it'd been archived. I just finished reading Her Majesty's Swarm and very much enjoyed a story about a character being born into a RTS type world.  

    If you haven't read that one already, check it out, if you had I was wondering if you had any luck finding others. It isn't fantastic literature by any measure, by an enjoyable popcorn piece in the genre you were looking for.

  I'm sick and tired of urban fantasy where all the humans-turned-paranormal-creatures angst and moan about their status and end up in endless relationship drama. Can anyone recommend me an urban fantasy featuring a group of paranormal creatures (werewolves, vampires, whatever), that realize being superhuman is dope and do cool shit?

  And yes, I've heard about *What We Do in the Shadows.* (which is great, btw, and you should all watch it.)

    [Night Watch](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_Watch_(Lukyanenko_novel)) is a very popular and influential Russian urban fantasy novel. I wouldn't call it rational, but it's still very cool, and while it has romantic relationships, it's more focused on ethical questions, like would it be moral to hand out hunting licenses to vampires if it saved lives overall.
    ```

    - u/jaghataikhan:
      ```
      Seconding Night Watch; the first three novels (short story collections?) are some of my favorite urban fantasy ever. It's got very evident Cold War influences, and just seems very Russian in its atmosphere/ writing
      ```

      - u/BavarianBarbarian_:
        ```
        It's one of those stories that make me wish I could read Russian. Some of the prose that makes it through translation to German unharmed makes me think it would've been a *beautiful* read in the original language.
        ```

  - u/netstack_:
    ```
    Arguably miscellaneous parts of Dresden Files. Not most of the cast but I remember there being a gang of werewolf college students who're just having a good time with their superhuman powers or something.

    I was sure I had more examples of this; it's got to be a YA novel stereotype at the least, but I'm coming up blank.
    ```

  - u/MagicWeasel:
    ```
    Luminosity/Radiance may fit the bill, if you haven't already read it.

    What sort of thing does "doing cool shit" consist of? It sounds like a fun thing to write a short story on, but there doesn't seem much conflict/story around werewolves setting up a ramp so they can jump over 16 buses. 

    All I can think of is them becoming super heroes (or like low-level "everyday" super heroes, with a werewolf e.g. sniffing out a lost cat), which isn't something I'd be interested in writing personally.

      Sold. A hundred upvotes to whoever writes the first novel about werewolves jumping over busses!

      But more seriously, I'm basically just asking for a run of the mill action/adventure/fantasy plot with urban fantasy trappings and worldbuilding.

        I mean I could *definitely* write a flash/short story about werewolves jumping over buses but it would probably have like almost nothing resembling actual plot.

          You know what? I shouldn't be asking for stories I'm not willing to write myself. Here we go!

          ~~~

          "You got the tape?"

          He nods. Pulls it out of his bomber jacket to show it to me.

          I suck at my teeth reflexively. Force of habit.

          "You got the cash?" He asks, muffled by the linen wraps around his face.

          I pull out a fifty-dollar bill and we swap. I'm practically salivating already as I tuck it away into a brown paper bag. We part ways without another word.

          Fen's waiting for me at the mouth of the alley, keeping a careful lookout.

          "Got it?" she asks. I nod.

          We hustle down the street, shooting paranoid glances at the passerby. As far as we know, they're all human. As far as we know. I grip my umbrella tighter, straining the stitching of my gloves.

          Three nerve-wracking city blocks later, we duck into our apartment building. I fold my umbrella in a single, practiced motion as soon as we're in its confines. Seriously bad juju to have it open indoors, and I say that as an experienced connoisseur of truly bad luck. It's another thirty fast-paced steps to the elevator (twenty for Fen). I mash the elevator button. I can hear Fen's heart beating a frenetic prestissimo, can hear the blood pumping through her veins.

          The elevator opens and we rush through. Fen keys in the secret code and steps back. I step forward. I know for a fact that the "close door" button is useless, but I mash it anyways. The door closes, and we're up, up, up, and away. Thaumatic rockets engage and even despite the fact that we're literally superhuman in the squat rack, both of us fall into an awkward crouch.

          Seconds later the retrothrusters kick in. We keep our heads from knocking against the ceiling with practiced ease, both pros at the one-hand ceiling pushup everyone who lives in the upper levels of our apartment eventually learn.

          We fall back towards the floor. The door opens with a ding.

          The next part of our journey is the shortest and most terrifying.

          The three grannies are arguing again in the middle of the hallway. Granny C holds a torn shawl in one of her hands emblazoned with the Meshugga logo as she curses out Granny A. We force smiles and push past them.

          Two of the tower's temporary guests are in the recreation area standing near the ping-pong table. They seem to be arguing about whether it's legal to use an extendable paddle. One of the players, an older gentleman with bushy sideburns, calls out to us, trying to get us to intervene in his dispute. Luckily, we're already out of his sight by the time he finishes his request.

          We avoid several other encounters with practiced but wary ease, both of us terrified that someone's going to see us with our contraband.

          But to our great relief, we make it back to our apartment without attracting notice.

          Fen bolts and padlocks the door behind us as I bring the tape to our beat-up old VCR.

          With more than a little reverence, I put it in and turn on the TV.

          ... and then take it back out as I realize it's at the end of the recording. Some people are fucking animals. "Be Kind, Rewind." It's not a difficult concept.

          Fen's back from the kitchen with popcorn by the time I finish resetting the tape. She's slathered it in our special sauce, and my mouth is watering, but I make sure the tape is in and playing before I begin to partake. It wouldn't do to get sauce on this bonafide historical artifact, after all.

          "Ready to lose our bet?" I ask, smug.

          Fen snorts and pulls out a wad of cash. "I've got the cash right here. And when I add your cash to it, I'll have more than enough for that vacation to Yellowstone."

          Our urge to shit-talk satisfied, we both turn to the TV with anticipation.

          It had been an absolute nightmare to find this tape. A relict of that brief interveilar age, that all-too-short period in the nineties where the undiluted hope engendered by the fall of the Soviet Union and the seeming dawn of a new age of peace had inspired us to step out from the shadows and into the light. (Well, metaphorically, anyways. I was constitutionally incapable of standing in direct sunlight.)

          A relict of an age that had lasted right up until the 2004 discovery that a pack of idiot Ifrits had helped Osama Bin Laden perform 9/11, anyways. After that, the Council had forced us to go right back into the shadows, including the reinstatement of the Veil and its memory-muddling effects.

          It had been a tragedy, one I'd campaigned futilely against. With memories of that time wiped from the collective human consciousness, only the artifacts of that time survived. Artifacts the Council had ruthlessly expunged. All of the people recorded on this tape had either forgotten they'd been in it, or been killed for their unwavering activism.

          I bit down against an upswell of black rage. Cleared my mind of dark memories and unpleasant recollections.

          My attention returned to the video, just as the intro finished.

          Adam Savage introduced his guest, a mustachioed man clad only in nylon boxers. His hair was bright red, and he was absolutely covered in the stuff, from his wizard-like beard to his hobbit-like feet. I clicked my tongue. I'd told him not to do this; said he'd look ridiculous. And guess what? I'd been absolutely right.

          I turned to look at Fen just in time to see her wipe away a tear. I wrapped an arm around her broad frame and pulled her towards me.

          By the time the video ended, we had a resolution to our bet. I was feeling an acute pain in my pocketbook, but can't really say I was all that put out to find out that a werewolf could, in fact, jump over sixteen school busses.

      Take someone with chronic health issues that cause fatigue as part of its effects as a protagonist, like Crohn's or something idk. Constant exhaustion hampers having a normal job or social life, doing both those at home through the internet (especially if you're self-employed, doing creative jobs like author, streamer, gamedev, etc.) also means sticking to a 9-5 day plan isn't important, so having your bodyclock go out of whack before getting bit by a vampire, the whole "suddenly sunlight kills you" isn't as major a shift, and people are less likely to notice your sudden aversion to daytime. Suddenly going from "unable to jog for more than a few minutes" to any amount of vampire strength/stamina would be a good deal, and just losing all your health problems in general because, technically, vampires are dead doesn't sound so bad either.

      You've got problems arising in the whole "okay I guess I have to sleep in my closet until the blackout curtains and duct tape I bought online arrives," and stuff like trying to work out how to make it to your disability income support government office appointment when the office is open 9-5 and you don't want to turn to ash.  You could go hard on the" sleeping as long as the sun is up" thing and suddenly your day gets cut from 16 hours awake to 12 or whatever, and maybe that eats into the time you can spend working or handling personal stuff and you need to try to find a way to use vampire powers to find a new job (nighttime photography?), or maybe your landlord wants to end your lease or raise the rent too high that you need to find a new place, but they only do inspections during the day so you have to break into places you're thinking about renting if you want to know what you're moving into. Maybe you've got a (hardcore religious) roommate too who's getting real suspicious of everything going on with you. 

      I suppose you could do some supernatural plot lines in your urban fantasy story too.
      ```

      - u/MagicWeasel:
        ```
        Oh man, that sounds a lot of fun to write! 

        The vampires in my universe have what one reader called "vampire puberty" so it's not a stark "human/vampire" transition but rather you slowly find foods less palatable/blood more, become slowly more sensitive to sunlight, etc. Vampire transformation also has a low success rate. Which would mess up a bit of the ideas you've presented for me personally to want to write them exactly as suggested.

        I like the ideas of using someone with chronic illness/disability, but at the same time, I know a non-negligible number of such folks aren't looking to be cured, but that's mostly stuff like the Deaf community (which due to their different languages is a culture of its own) and people who are autistic who think of themselves as part of human neurodiversity rather than "sick". 

        I think the standard "underachieving nerd" is a great template for this, and how she might revel in using her new powers a few years after her change. A lot of the obstacles you talk about don't have to be immediately after the change. I will try and start with a flash when I next do some writing and see if it fleshes out into something worth sharing.

    Wikipedia says urban fantasy includes fics set as far back as the 19th century, so [A Journey Of Black And Red](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26675/a-journey-of-black-and-red) just scrapes in. There's a little moaning at the start as the protag has her life stolen from her and is sold into essential slavery, but it quickly improves and the majority of fic is her being a badass and growing in power. Not explicitly rational and there's *occasionally* some rule-of-cool, but it's good enough I am considering subscribing to the patreon.

  In part because This Used To Be About Dungeons is reminding me of how great they are, I'm jonesing for more dungeon-adjacent/crafting/shopkeeping slice of life stories.

  As a level-setter/context, I will say that I really enjoyed the Magic Shop arcs / chapters of Never Die Twice and was sad when they ended. I also like the crafting bits in The Way Ahead and liked Dungeon I/O. I really disliked, like "wow, if this can be successful, why am I not writing my own stories" level of disliked, Magical Smithing.

    Not full on magic shop, but I really liked Spice and Wolf light novel series. It's more about a travelling merchant, and it's more romance + some economic drama than full on slice of life, but still very relaxing. Might be worth a look? 

    Also maybe going a bit too far away from your request, but have you tried the few barkeeping indie pixel games out there? Something like The Red Strings Club or Va-11 Hall-A?

  Building off the comment about Buffy are there any good novels/web novels with a rational take on vampires? I’ve read Luminosity and [Contratto](https://archiveofourown.org/works/7127255).
  ```

  - u/MagicWeasel:
    ```
    My novel "Vampire Flower Language" has just been finished, if you wanted to check it out: https://archiveofourown.org/works/13710744

    Very classic vampires with a few little quirks of their own. For example, having a vampire feed from you means you benefit from nootropic effects for the next month or so, so vampires tend to maintain groups of humans called "janissaries" who they feed from as it's a mutualistic partnership. 

    I go into a bit of an FAQ of "why you might like it" in the completion thread, which contains only very mild spoilers: https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/p4j8ll/rthfcrom_vampire_flower_language_epilogue_all/

    Happy to answer questions. It's very different from both Luminosity and Contratto. (Luminosity is my favourite rational work of all time, I would say. I'm re-reading it now: so good!)

    If you haven't read Radiance or the Lumonisity short stories that Alicorn wrote, those are both obviously easy recommendations too.

        What fortuitous timing, then! I hope it has whatever you are looking for in rational vampire stories.

    A rational take on vampires is a side-plot in [Blindsight](https://www.rifters.com/real/Blindsight.htm).
    ```

    - u/andor3333:
      ```
      Blindsight is great and I would also recommend it but I never understood why there was a vampire in it. It had nothing to do with the primary plot at all. They’d be in space on the mission planning what to do about the aliens and all of the sudden there would be a random aside about the history of vampires and how scary vampires are and how they were defeated but it never really affected the main story. It didn’t take away from it, just seemed odd.

        I think they did serve a function, just not as vampires if that makes sense. Huge spoilers ahead don't read if you haven't read the book.

        >!The concept of Blindsight was that intelligence and consciousness are separate things and conscious species may be at a disadvantage to nonconscious intelligent species.!<

        >!The vampire plot expands that, and makes it personal to earth, by revealing that conscious humanity was almost outcompeted by a nonconscious subspecies, vampires. The only reason conscious humanity persisted is because of a vampire evolutionary quirk that didn't affect competitive fitness in a hunter-gatherer environment.!<

        I think the their plot really helped to show that Blindsight's concept was universal with immediate consequences to earth. I just don't think they needed to be called vampires.

    There's an obscure fic called ["Let Me In 2,"](https://fanfiction.net/s/7423061/1/Let-Me-In-2) which is a rational sequel to a book about a vampire.

    It requires you to know canon pretty well, though. The book is fairly short, and there's a decent movie (the Swedish 2008 one! not the American 2010 one!) if you want to familiarize yourself with the material. Actually, I would consider the Swedish film to be even better than the book since it cut some of really unnecessary edgy scenes.

      If I remember correctly the author actually based on the sequel directly off the American version Movie, due to Chloe Morentz performance, which they really liked and inspired this particular story.

      I haven't seen the American version, I have seen the Swedish version, which I think is very, very good, but yeah. I am not sure for the purposes of this fanfiction if it matters which version you see, but what I can say is that this is one of my all time favorite fanfictions I've ever read, and it is so good that I consider it to have crossed the line of fanfiction and just be "great" no qualifiers necesssary.

      So yeah, watch whatever version, but really, I fully recommend reading this fanfiction it is amazing!

    Elves in Wen Spencer's "Tinker" series are basically vampires, in every way other than the surface. (E.g., they aren't fangy, they don't drink blood, and they don't turn into bats. Instead, they fulfill all of the relevant literary tools, tropes, and positions that vampires classically do.) I don't know if that makes any sense except in my head.

  Anyone know any good survival/colony TV shows where people actually work together?

    I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say such a show doesn't really exist. That is, a group survival story that doesn't devolve into self-sabotage or interpersonal drama. Writers seem to *always* end up with a "the true monsters were humans all along!" narrative.

      I am not an expert, but my best guess is that interpersonal conflicts:

      * are very cheap to produce
      * can be sustained indefinitely
      * can leverage any number of pre-existing writing cliches which makes writing easy

      Conversely, an external threat:

      * can be expensive to produce
      * gets stale unless you keep tweaking it

      Not a TV show, but Heinlein's [Tunnel in the Sky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunnel_in_the_Sky) mostly averts this. Some conflict is inevitable because of human nature, but almost all the characters do a good job of working together anyway -- they really *don't* want to end up in a Hobbesian state of nature, so they put actual effort into resolving their differences in more reasonable ways.

      I don't know if I'd reccomend it as being cooperation focused -- IIRC, the show makes a point of going through different styles of government, each with their own tensions internally, with the rest of the students, and with the struggle to pilot their spaceship and survive. 

      However, it gets huge props for trying the 'cast of 500' thing, the soundtrack was hype as hell at the time, and I enjoyed the show's take on how different structures of government are formed and maintained. 

      It also gets huge rational points for certain fight scenes -- I remember one moment where they're coming up on being within range of another ship also in orbit around mars, a moment that's been days in the making. So they carefully line their shot, wait for the right instant then fire the spine-mounted railgun. They miss, the enemy ship is out of range again in under a second, and then it's 8 hours trying to debug their railgun targeting code and figure out what went wrong, while waiting for another convergence in their respective orbits. It struck me as an extremely plausible thing to have happen in near-future intrasystem combat in a way that most anime with spaceships never achieve. 

      It then trades away those rational points for cool points with the wire-guided mecha and the, uh, space ocean.

    Advance warning: this is long but I don't think it has what you were looking for.

    I don't know  if "The 3%" (brazillian show on Netflix) is what you're looking for, there's definitely lots of people trying to sabotage each other, but there's  also lots of people working together. Also not sure if it's a colony in the same way as the others. But the second season becomes more "us vs them", with "us" and "them" not being just two different factions from the same group. But it's what I thought of when I read your question and nobody has given you other leads so that might work? It's more post-apocalyptic survival style, though.

    The only other one I really know is Stargate: Universe but there's two major factions (military/civilian) who work against each other (3%, at least at first, has a lot more individualism), but they are *trying* to have unity, just disagreeing on who the CO should be. Lots of interpersonal drama, though. It gets off to a slow start but the back half of season 2 is some of the best sci-fi I've seen on TV. Much more rational than typical stargate, not that it's hard.

    Stargate Atlantis is probably not good by today's standards (I loved it though) and is definitely not rational, but the people there work together more than anyone else, but it's not colony/survival as they show up in a working alien colony building and just have to repair it when it goes on the fritz.

    In the end I think it's going to be hard not to have some sort of intra-colony conflict because characters get developed and then writers naturally find points of conflict. It makes for logical, straight-forward arcs. I haven't seen enough of the shows you mention to know if "actively sabotage" is more "rivalry between two alpha males that is usually somewhat friendly but sometimes gets heated" or more "literally trying to kill each other".

  Any progression fantasy or litrpg where the protagonist follows a purely physical build, or as close to physical as possible? I'm thinking something similar to the latter half of Paragon of Destruction, where the protagonist can't use his magic, so he has to do body cultivation and just gets really really physically strong. 

  Another example that gets close is an Outcast in Another World, where the protagonist goes all in on Vitality and ends up becoming a tank rather than a spellsword or mage.

    I'm interested in this too. I think the "world's best swordsman" side of WtC showed a glimpse of how cool an extreme physical build could be, but obviously we didn't get much more of that.

    I think I've seen something related in Rihaku's quests, specifically [A Simple Transaction](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/a-simple-transaction.37859/). I didn't finish it, and it looks like he might pick up sorcery or something later, but for a taste of the kind of plans being executed:

    > [ ] The Destroyer - Longsword, Shelter II, Magnitude I [Pay 2,000 Will]

    > Seram will attempt to bait large groups of orcs into attacking him in an enclosed space, then kill them to power level, increasing his physical stats and allowing him to kill more of them, repeating ad infinitum until that group of orcs is dead. Shelter ensures that Seram does not have to be individually aware of each attack launched against him. Even Magnitude I provides a substantial increase to combat effectiveness by increasing the speed of Seram's attacks another 10%, making them more difficult for Orcs to evade.

    > Risk: lol

    > Pros:

    > *Intentionally designed to surround oneself with Orcs and thus far less vulnerable to the tactic

    > *Pretty hardcore

    > *Seram's father would be proud

    > *Extreme pressure and intensity of chosen plan will motivate Seram to work harder, increasing Skill acquisition rate by 50%

    > *If successful, advancement rate will drastically exceed that of other options

    > *Relatively safe for Sielie since she doesn't do anything

    > *Might exterminate the orcs

    > Cons:

    > *Are you fucking crazy

    > *Have to assign Stat points in combat

    > *Sielie may be pissed at being relegated to a support role

    > *Still kind of vulnerable to grapples, though most can be dodged if the orc is wearing armor, and a dagger can be used for close quarters combat.

    > *If you run into a high-level orc at first, before you have gained momentum from leveling up multiple times, death is almost certain

    Note also that Rihaku has a TON of quests between Spacebattles and especially Sufficient Velocity. A lot of them share some metaverse elements like the Accursed and the Logos. The writing style is pretty distinctive and I warn you that if you don't enjoy the flavor...it's very consistent.

    I don't think you get much closer to a pure physical build in Xianxia than Defiance of the Fall's axe-wielding MC.
    ```

    - u/CaramilkThief:
      ```
      Already read it, but thanks! I was kind of torn on whether or not I should include Defiance of the Fall as an example, but in the end decided not to. After a certain point the Zach's Daos (and not just his axe dao) make more difference in a fight than his physical prowess. And, well, he kinda becomes half caster half melee at E grade. Same thing with The New World, where the protagonist starts with a physical build but it gets more and more magical later on, until at some point he's just a glorified caster. 

      I do think that there's a lot of potential in a physical build, especially one with a lot of speed and enough tankiness to survive that speed. It does require that normal physics holds in the world, without conceptual fuckery or something like immunity to kinetic damage. But with enough speed you could make small shockwaves from your punches, even more speed and your fists would be fireballs (from the air friction). More and more speed equals bigger fireballs, see [xkcd](https://what-if.xkcd.com/1/) article for reference. And that's just what happens with a fast enough punch, I imagine you could munchkin that speed into other things too.
      ```

  - u/-main:

    I have two! Give these a try: 

    The first is [The New World](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/12024/the-new-world), a system-apocalypse litrpg where the protagonist goes full END primary/WIL secondary determinator. The author made the numbers/threats scale and continue scaling well past what I expected such that it really scratched that progression itch, and the second (IIRC? not the bug in the cave, the guy in the tree) main antagonist was excellently written and defied my expectations. Eventually (pretty far in -- it's over 1M words) it starts to show the broader world and the context of the system a bit more, which I enjoyed. 

    The second is [An Exercise in Stupidity](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13067349/20/An-Exercise-in-Stupidity), a RWBY fanfic starting well ahead of canon, where a guy with the litrpg semblence (which basically lets him decide his stats, the author has stats for everyone but they're automatically allocated and not minmaxed) goes CON primary / STR secondary melee main-tank for his build. I liked several of the characters, and it eventually intertwined with/disrupted canon in fun ways. It's much better than you'd expect from a story where the protagonist takes INT as his dump stat.

    Both are absolutely doing the physical build thing, are quite long, and are tolerably executed with some redeeming features to the writing/worldbuilding, but I don't know if I'd reccomend them if you hadn't asked this exact question. Neither one is finished nor (I believe) updating anymore, and they're reasonably well done for fanfic but neither hugely quality nor particularly rational.

      I've read both, but thanks! I talked a bit about why I decided not to use The New World as an example at another reply. I liked it at first but kinda lost interest around chapter 190ish, and imo while the worldbuilding was good the writing never really good good enough to express it well. 

      I really liked An Exercise in Stupidity at first, especially how the protagonist just sorta headbutted his way through plot points and whatnot, but also kinda lost interest by the end.

    You can check out the subreddit wiki for some general info and links.

    90%+ of works recommended here are going to be free online works. Also, a lot of it is very long, so my first recommendation is The Metropolitan Man, because it’s only 80k words. It’s a Superman fanfic that makes you sympathetic to Lex Luthor. It’s written by Alexander Wales, who also wrote some other works popular here like Worth the Candle and Branches on the Tree of Time. Branches on the Tree of Time is another good short one, it’s a fanfic of Terminator.

    The most popular works here were Worth the Candle and Mother of Learning, but those have ended.

  I think I've seen a couple people bring up *Buffy the Vampire Slayer* in here before. I just wrote a [review](https://recordcrash.substack.com/p/the-2021-buffy-review) to dissuade you from watching it.
  ```

  - u/ianstlawrence:
    ```
    This article feels like it provides very few concrete things that you think are bad and why they are bad, but instead just says things are bad?

    It is brought up at the beginning of the article that there is 144 episodes of about 40 minutes each, which is a long time, but a lot of your criticism can be summed up as "The writers did a bad job with this character." Which is a fine opinion to have, but the lack of sourcing that opinion, to me, makes me less inclined to feel like this is a review.

    Also, I felt it was very weird to write an article on Buffy, but then to, I presume, make fun of another article of buffy in one of the photo captions. Maybe this was very meta of you, because in another part of the article you say that the writers want to have their cake and eat it, and it seems like you did the exact same thing by writing a review you want to change peoples' minds but also be able to make fun of reviews?

    Generally, I think reviews should do a lot of work when ever critiquing art because art is very much subjective, so you have to do a lot, a lot of work to take something that we all pretty much agree is subjective and then make strong opinions about it, if those opinions are supposed to influence people.

    I'd be interested to hear you actually break down some of your critiques. 
    -What moments or parts of Sarah Michelle Gellars' acting did you think was terrible? How do you balance that with the "camp" that Buffy goes for? Did you feel like her acting ever got better? Did it get worse? Why do you think that was?
    - You mention Spike as both a good and bad addition to the show, overall how did you feel about Spike? You mention that the writers had to do a lot of heavy lifting to try to get Spike to hang out with a bunch of kids, did you ever feel that worked? Very surprised that you called Spike's relationship with Buffy as original and surprising and then later as boring and repetitive, can you elaborate as to when and how that happened?
    -You mention that none of the main heroes die in the finale, but you also mention the idea that the show is supposed to be about growing up. Would it not make sense then for none of the main characters, who are supposed to "grow up" to die? If they died, its not like they can grow up? 

    Overall, I just wish you had gone a lot deeper into your review to back up your statements. Because it kinda feels like I could take your review, switch all the bad adjectives to good adjectives, and we would be in much the same place.

      Responding from most objectionable to least:

      > Because it kinda feels like I could take your review, switch all the bad adjectives to good adjectives, and we would be in much the same place.

      Now this is just an unfair representation. To quote myself "She has trouble acting human, and falls into the role of a character who always says what the audience is thinking, even if it unwittingly hurts people’s feelings. Often, she admits characters are contradicting their established motivations, or that the current plot of the week makes no sense.". It's not like I just say "Anya is good". For bad things, check out the paragraph that starts with 'Regrettably'.

      > it seems like you did the exact same thing by writing a review you want to change peoples' minds but also be able to make fun of reviews?

      I'm not sure it's a review, I just thought the title (which I didn't read past) was funny, particularly because Season 6 had some of the most basic, shallow writing in the show (Willow goes through magic drug addiction, which I address throughout the review, and it's handled with the tact and realism of 90s PSAs).

      I don't know why you thought it wouldn't be fine to make fun of my review in any case, I added a lot of jokes to it on purpose.

      > Very surprised that you called Spike's relationship with Buffy as original and surprising and then later as boring and repetitive, can you elaborate as to when and how that happened?

      That's what happens when a relationship makes no sense, it's only initially original and surprising. Unfortunately, they couldn't figure out what to do with it other than each member taking turns to toxic-ly use the other, culminating in a rape attempt, which I didn't really want to address in detail.

      > but the lack of sourcing that opinion, to me, makes me less inclined to feel like this is a review

      Different reviewers have different standards, of course, but if I had sourced everything I said, it'd be over ten times longer. It's much easier to find screencaps for parts of the show people enjoyed, too. Ultimately, my priorities were 1. expressing my untainted opinion while it lasted, 2. being funny, and as a distant 3. being rigorous and objective. I didn't actually wrote the review to make people hate Buffy or anything, I just don't think /r/rational would enjoy it.

      > What moments or parts of Sarah Michelle Gellars' acting did you think was terrible? How do you balance that with the "camp" that Buffy goes for? Did you feel like her acting ever got better? Did it get worse? Why do you think that was? 

      I do kind of address this. She's only convincing when she plays an insecure pouty teenager, outside of that she has trouble being believably sad, angry or badass. This is extremely hard to express in a review without just using clips, and you're ultimately just taking my word for it anyway. She's not overacting in a campy way, she's consistently underacting. I wouldn't say her acting gets worse, but it gets more demanding, so it kind of does.

      > You mention Spike as both a good and bad addition to the show, overall how did you feel about Spike?

      I have TWO Spike sections! It's a mixed opinion and I have trouble reconciling his character across the angsty divide.

      > You mention that none of the main heroes die in the finale, but you also mention the idea that the show is supposed to be about growing up.

      No, I said that the episodes mirror the trials of adolescence and then adulthood, but that doesn't mean it's the only or most important theme. Still a fair point to make, though. I guess you had to be there to understand they were really stressing the "Sacrifice" part in season seven.

      Thanks for reading the review. I think I'm adding a few things I said here to it. Out of curiosity, have you watched Buffy before? Buffy watchers I talked to before posting the review here thought it was a fair one.
