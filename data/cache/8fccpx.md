## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  So Puerto Rico [seems to be pushing](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/washington-secrets/puerto-rico-opens-bid-for-statehood-enlists-56-million-islanders-in-us) for statehood. And I'm completely in favor, because if they manage to get it then the US is only two additional states away from being [one nation, indivisible.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number?wprov=sfla1)

    Then you could also do a flag redesign. A loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooong 1x53 row of stars!

      ```
      In the same way that the current flag is 4 rows of 5 and 5 rows of 6, you could resolve a flag of 53 stars into 3 rows of 7 and 4 rows of 8. Granted, that would squash the flag, but you could make the stars slightly smaller and introduce a small amount of space between each row to compensate. 

      On the other hand, if you want a return to nice looking concentric circles, you could have a single star in the center, then 4, then 16, then 32.

          I feel kind of weird seeing that, since the dude gets more per month than *Wildbow* (although he has fewer patrons.) Though on the other hand, if Wildbow ever gets around to making a nice print version of Worm I can guarantee he'll make boatloads of money. (I've personally pre committed to spending up to $100 on a boxed set.)

            That's the largesse of Royalroad's readership at work. I've witnessed fans of the xianxia genre and web novels spend mindboggling amounts on their stories (e.g. crowd-funded $80 to translate each 2-6k word chapter). How these stories get hyped in a community and why some stories strike gold in their audience's imagination/pockets is worth studying. I can't imagine a traditional publishing house being interested, but as [the digital overtakes print](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/12/print-journalism-may-last-another-10-years-new-york-times-ceo.html), the niche might grow to overtake the standard. 

            As for the interruption in WtC's schedule, it *might* have something to do with [a recent conversation I had with the recently appointed CFO of WtC](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8bhjwe/rtwip_worth_the_candle_ch_8889_solitudeface/dxku1sd/). Hopefully it's because CRJ/AW is migrating WtC to his own site or adopting a new Patreon system (rather than anything unfortunate like sickness).

              I admire the noncommercial nature of the way WtC has been handled so far, but if there was desire he could make a lot more. It's a great story with a broad appeal. The one tier being $1 just boggles my mind. An interesting conversation you had there, and good observations on your part.

  I'm looking for a story about summoning demons that I read at some point, but can't find. I think I might have originally seen it from the rationalist-sphere, so I figured I'd ask here (r/tipofmytongue didn't help). Does it sound familiar to anyone? Here's what I remember from the story:

  Demons are believed to be extremely manipulative, and can trick people into selling their souls. You can summon demons, and they will sometimes do things for you. It is possible to prevent a demon from talking to you when you summon it, so that it can't manipulate you, and this is generally considered safe. The main character at first refuses to learn how to summon a demon, because he knows he wouldn't be able to resist letting it talk. But at some point he is overcome by curiosity, summons a demon, and has a conversation with it. He does this many times, and the demons actually seem like kind of normal people, so he concludes that everyone has misunderstood demons. The demons convince him that selling souls to demons isn't a real thing, and that some demons just pretend to accept peoples' souls as payment for helping them just to mess with people. The main character sells his soul multiple times, believing that this doesn't actually change anything. After the main character starts talking to demons, some people avoid talking to him to avoid demons manipulating them by proxy.

  People usually have to pay demons something in order to get the demons to help them. Paying the demons with sex is common. At some point, a demon helps the main character in exchange for blog recommendations, or something like that. At one point, someone says she summoned a demon just to have sex with it, and this left quite an impression on the main character.

  So, they finally and shockingly caught the GSK/EAR/ONS/BDK/probably known by other names too, after 44 years, with DNA evidence. They apparently got it through Ged Match and geneology, narrowed it down to a suspect, and then identified him based on discarded DNA.

  While it's amazing they caught a guy who murdered more than 12 people and raped more than 50, does this spell a death knell for privacy? In 20 years time will the fact your cousin submitted her DNA to a geneology service mean that you will never be able to get out of paying a parking ticket again? Or will criminals get caught more often and we'll live in a crime-free utopia?

    Yes.

    Or more realistically, I expect to see in-person crime significantly decrease as privacy approaches zero for your regular citizen, but since offensive technology typically outpaces defensive in the modern era, new ways to commit crime despite the limits placed on privacy will be invented.

  - u/CouteauBleu:
    ```
    I'm not sure how much that'll matter in ~50 years, but you also have to account for the amount of effort the police is putting in different cases. For instance, the cops are more likely to collect DNA samples on a crime scene than in a parking lot where you skipped paying your ticket; the same rule probably applies to internet forensics.

  So I accepted a job offer in San Francisco starting June 11th. So much to work out. The big thing right now is how long to rent an Airbnb and if I should move a week early or two. Any advice would be appreciated. I'm exited and nervous.

  **Edit:**

  Some more info. I'm starting as a software engineer at a startup right after college. The pay was more than I expected even accounting for the cost of living and I think I should be able to pay between 2k and 3k for housing eventually

  My basic plan right now is:

  * Fly down near the start of June with a backpack and checked bag
     * Weeks worth of clothes
     * Basic hygiene stuff
     * Probably very basic kitchen type stuff if room
  * Find someplace to rent more long term within a week or two
  * Buy basic stuff
     * mattress 
     * bedding
     * Maybe a bit more kitchen stuff
  * Start working
  * Ship more stuff from home
     * Extra clothes
     * More kitchen stuff 
     * More bedding maybe
     * Desktop stuff

  The big pieces I'm unsure about are how long it will take me to find somewhere to rent and if I should actually try to find somewhere to rent and move in before I start work or if it makes more sense to do that while I'm working.

  I'm also sort of worried as I don't have much renting history. I do have a fairly good credit score (just under 800) and quite a bit of savings so I could offer to pay for the first couple months ahead of time or something.

    The high 700s is more than enough to rent decent housing and tenants who can pay ahead of time is every landlord's dream. It's generally wise to settle down your housing before starting a new job in a new place. You don't need the added stress of finding someplace to live while learning the ropes or settling into your new job. Once that's over, I recommend investing in a good mattress because a good night's sleep makes everything else easier. You might want to visit a mattress retailer because you can only trust anecdotes and reviews to a degree - it's more about what your body likes and finds comfortable.

    /u/phylogenik Unless you're a mattress collector/aficionado, you'll never know the difference between a $1000 or sub-$200 mattress until you've tried both. I have a Tuft and Needle myself, but I didn't find it particularly better than my previous decade-or-two-old spring mattress. Don't fall for the fallacy that pricier = more comfortable for your body type. Though, from general reviewer consensus, mattress quality is pretty terrible nowadays at the low/middle-end unless you're buying off a trusted retailer.
    ```

    - u/space_fountain:
      ```
      Certainly in this area the high 700s are more than enough, but in the bay area if I don't want a long commute its looking like i'm going to pay at least 1500.  I certainly don't know though.

      Similarly from what I'm reading I don't really have any chance of renting from out of state.

    I listened to an episode of Sam Harris' podcast where they have a long conversation about the meaning of the word "truth", and it really did not make me like him. He tried to define truth as both "factually correct" and/or "evolutionarily advantageous". I don't think Harris really got to the bottom of why Peterson wanted to redefine the word like that, but some commenters pointed out that he was likely trying to do so in order to be able to say that his religion is "true" without proving it correct.

    I'd be happy to hear that the podcast was a bad first impression, and he's actually completely different, but if it was a representative sample then I have little interest in listening to someone willing to play such word games in order to score points.

    I find him frustrating more than anything. He's a (Decent? Good?) clincial psychologist who speaks with unshakable confidence on topics unrelated to his field, a self help guru who mixes good suggestions in with lots of philosophical woo, a Narrativemancer who doesn't seem to want to or be capable of distinguishing between the narrative map and the territory, and most annoyingly, an ideologue who bills himself as anti-ideologies.

    And he got all his fame by (seemingly wilfully) misrepresenting a Canadian bill about trans people and acting like a last bastion of sanity and freedom from post-modern tyranny, which of course got him legions of fans who have given him millions of dollars in Patreon donations.

    There are far smarter people doing all the things he does right, and people just don't know about them because they didn't make a name for themselves in the culture war and don't have as refined an image/speaking voice. In short he's a walking personification of the Halo Effect and the Toxoplasma of Rage. And of course he's just wrong about a lot of stuff, some of which are psychology related. 

    So yeah. Not a fan :P

        http://sds.utoronto.ca/blog/bill-c-16-no-its-not-about-criminalizing-pronoun-misuse/

        If he framed it as a slippery slope I might feel more sympathetic, but the vociferous nature of his opposition for what the majority of legal experts seem to agree is simply an expansion of protected classes makes him come off as intentionally obtuse due to ideological disagreement.  He regularly mischaracterizes and strawmans any kind of progressive position or issue he disagrees with, so this just seems more of the same.

            I did actually read through yours, it just didn't strike me as particularly unbiased enough for me to trust their analysis, and their refutations all seem weak or disingenuous, as they keep trying to insist that Peterson actually thinks something more reasonable than what he said.

            The quoted comment in particular kind of highlights why I feel that way. Peterson is fantastic at saying multiple things in multiple places that each sound reasonable in context but are somewhat contradictory when put side by side, and he does it in that very set of paragraphs. He cannot be calling it just the start of a slippery slope if he is also asserting that his discussion "may have already been rendered illegal."  He also has said that his lectures might be labeled a hate crime. There is no call for that sort of implication. It's hyperbolic and just nonsensical, and the only defense he offers is that his university sent him letters expressing concern. 

            So he trusts his university getting nervous about what he was saying over lawyers telling him he was wrong. There are a dozen reasons why his university may have sent those letters, from being stupid to being overly sensitive to liability to being pressured to appear progressive. The university sending the letters is very weak evidence that his interpretation of the law is correct.

            Also, get some sleep :P We can continue this tomorrow if you'd like.

    Apparently (I haven’t read/watched much myself, but I have read several critiques), Jordan Peterson attracts the support of the alt-right because a lot of his stuff argues for traditional values and his emphasis on self improvement is structured such that it serves as an argument against improving society as a whole.  I’ve heard the term Status Quo Warrior (the polar opposite of SJW and I think it fits).  A lot of philosophical stuff (and other areas outside his expertise) he gets outright wrong (and the way he gets it wrong aligns with the alt right view of postmodernism and “cultural Marxism”).  

    Check out /r/enoughpetersonspam if you want to see a lot of little potshots at his stuff.  If you want, I can post some of the select problematic examples I’ve seen critiqued.  On the surface Peterson may sound okay, but the actual content and meaning is at best empty fluff and at worst outright fascist.

        >I disagree that it serves as an argument against trying to fight for progress, he's just saying that these kids (let's call them what they are, kids) haven't lived in the real world yet and organized their own lives and that maybe the people running things know more about how things are run than the kids do.

        This is the standard conservative party line to dismiss anything younger generations say about the fucked up things the people with power use it for. This was said during the Vietnam protests, and the Iraq War protests, and yes Occupy Wallstreet, and countless other progressive, youth-led movements. It's not new or any more true just because he put an impossible bar to reach in front of it. 

        And singling out "kids" is not helpful for this. Many of the "kids" being referred to here are in their 20s and 30s, which is an age group which includes some of the smartest and most informed people I know. Yes, most people marching in the streets are not super informed of all the nuances of the issues they're protesting. Occupy Wallstreet in particular was frustrating because of how much it lacked coherent and knowledgeable leadership to make use of everyone's anger. 

        But if everyone waited for their lives to be perfect before they tried to fight for change, literally no one would fight for change. There is a grain of good advice in "clean your room first," but Peterson does nothing to distinguish that grain or draw any sorts of lines around when it's okay to fight for what you believe in rather than "mind your own business."

        >It's SJWs' fault that the alt-right exists. It's SJWs' fault that Trump got elected.

        I'm sorry, but this is just nonsense. This is what alt-rights people and Trump voters love to say, and it's just ridiculous to believe them without actually examining where things stand and why. 

        First off, the alt-right has existed in some form for DECADES. American fascism isn't new. White supremacy isn't new. If you honestly think that the SJWs spawned institutions like Breitbart or Stormfront, then I legitimately don't know who you think "the SJWs" refer to, or how long ago you think they coagulated as a define-able mass.

        Second, Trump did NOT win because of SJWs. People who already have reason to dislike SJWs keep saying this, and it's utter bullshit.  Trump won because ~80,000 people in the Rust belt voted for him. Rural voters in dying manufacturing and coal towns weren't sufficiently placated by Clinton and went with the guy who promised them the moon, despite him showing no way at all for how he would fulfill those promises. 

        Again: rural, older people voted for Trump.  And they largely don't give a shit about SJWs. They don't live near or on colleges. They don't get angry about idiots on Tumblr. They care about jobs and immigrants way more than they care about some man-haters giving feminism a bad name.

        I get the dislike of SJWs. I get being frustrated by them as a progressive. But all you're doing by buying into and repeating the alt-right and Trump voters' narrative that SJWs are to blame for their own shitty beliefs and decisions is diverting attention from the actual problems.

  Could someone explain the rules to me?

  Subreddit Rules

      Post links to or **discussion of rational fiction only;** otherwise use one of the weekly discussion threads.

  I have the question: What would a rational superhero costume look like? For example, a flying brick or spiderman would wear and have climbing/safety harnesses to be able to evacuate/transport people. And most would have backpacks with first aid stuff.

  Where should I post that? In the worldbuilding subreddit or does the question count of discussion ofrational fiction?
  ```

  - u/GaBeRockKing:
    ```
    That would best fit in the worldbuilding thread, although friday offtopic is also a legit home,and you could rephrase this so it fits in saturday munchkinry.
    ```

  - u/sicutumbo:
    ```
    I think you could simply post a discussion thread about superhero armor. It would fit the current rules, as it would be discussion of rational decision making in various rational stories posted here.

    In regards to your actual question, I think the vast majority of superhero costumes would benefit from additional armor. Unless some aspect of their power makes wearing armor impractical, it's the simplest way to increase survivability and utility. Especially for the glass canon type people, relying on your ability to dodge any incoming attacks is just silly. Most of the time in comics, they just wear spandex. Which, as far as I know, has no appreciable ability to stop knives or bullets.

    One of my favorite regularly updating stories is  [With this Ring](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-thread-twelve.25032/), where the main character is a Lantern. It's on the lower end of the power scale for DC, but the main character has stated and demonstrated that his base level defenses are capable of blocking tank rounds, and his active defenses are variable but can hold out against orbital bombardment. Despite this, he has spent significant effort making the best power armor available, and at this point is the second most armored Justice League affiliate. The only reason he isn't the first is that he doesn't have any divinely forged protective equipment, and he won't use any equipment that he can't make/repair/maintain himself (i.e. magical materials). He's mentioned that his power armor is essentially a human sized space craft.
    ```

    - u/buckykat:
      ```
      A lot of times though, the 'spandex' is stated to actually be some exotic material which is the only thing which can stand up to whatever the power is. Think Flash or Reed Richards or Superman's cape.
      ```

      - u/sicutumbo:
        ```
        Flash and Reed Richards have actual restrictions on their ability to wear armor and use their abilities at the same time. Superman's cape is mostly aesthetic, and I could see him having legitimate difficulty in finding armor that would survive in his fights, much less protect him.

        I'm more thinking of people like Robin, Green Arrow, Black Canary, Black Widow, or Captain America. They are generally shown to not wear any significant armor, even when armor would be extremely helpful. Maybe Cap's suit is actually some really advanced Kevlar or something, although I kinda doubt it, but Black Canary wears a jacket and fishnets. Their fighting wouldn't be significantly hampered with some additional protection, and as it is they're really vulnerable to knives and bullets.
        ```

        - u/buckykat:
          ```
          Well of course we both know the real reason is A E S T H E T I C S.

          Movie Cap at least has some minor biker jacket tier armor.

          Most of the ones you listed there are really just baseline humans, and the trade-off between armor and maneuverability is pretty well established in those. Doesn't justify fishnets, but then there's also no justification for Robin's existence at all.
          ```

      Discussion thread would probably get more replies than weekly thread. But I checked the rules and it sounded like only about written stories. (But I guess the rules are old, and most don't follow them)



      You assume that all superheroes would be fighting. (Yeah, probably true.)

      But what we need would be some stereotype superheroes type:

      [like the first I find with google](http://superheroesandvillains.wikia.com/wiki/Types_of_Superheroes)

      And then look who would need how much armor. And what kind. Or what else would they have. Like a brick should have at least a taser (like every hero with instakill powers).

      A teleporter (depending on limitations) should have at least 3 secure rooms/holding cells to teleport people in (maybe with less pressure/oxygen). And maybe rope, if they need to touch someone.  

      A gadgeteer should have always tools and some materials like a power source. Better a tank as a mobile workspace if possible.

      A mastermind should have as many ways as practical to communicate with the team. Like gps tracking and conference calls with headphones. Bodycams. 

      Or for example, I would say armor, that is only supposed to block bullets is quite stupid, if you can take tank rounds naked while sleeping. If it also protects from ABC weapons, it would be worth it for a brick/tank. But maybe not, if nobody uses even mace and the armor gets shredded every fight.

      But yeah most could use more armor. At least a bulletproof vest would be nice for most. (Also real spandex suits look stupid, no clue what hollywood does.)

      Still you would need to look what objectives they have, what they do regulary and how they be more efficient (while still being superhero, cause Rule of cool). For example spiderman could have rope with him. He would save so much web fluid. 

      Or airlines would paint markers on the airplane where superman should carry them.


      I will read the stories, sometime... I will add it to the list :-)

    That sounds to me like the average worldbuilding thread question. I do think the rules should be relaxed, our level of activity doesn't warrant being picky.

      I kind of like the status quo, actually. It concentrates discussions in the discussion threads, and each comment ends up being like its own mini-thread.

  *(A question at least tangentially related to Roko’s basilisk.)*

  >Companies, whole industries, and governments are either already gathering data on users \ citizens to build psychological profiles, or will start doing so soon enough, when the ones that do so now will prove how useful this approach is for targeted advertisement, voter manipulation, riot prevention and control, etc.

  >Among the biggest such entities are facebook and google, and if the recent developments with facebook and CA have made at least some people weary of it, the trust towards google (and that it won’t be abusing its capabilities) is still rather high. Though even if google somehow manages to maintain some of its morality code down the line, there’s still the possibility that some of its gathered data will get leaked or stolen.

  >And given how large a presence google has on the internet (chrome, gmail, google search history, google analytics, etc), this data will be enough to rebuild a virtual copy of an internet user, even if that copy will not be a 100% accurate simulation.

  >Besides google and facebook there are also many other companies that specialise on data mining like this, and their data too can be abused — or stolen\leaked and *then* abused.

  So what happens 10, 20, 50 years from now, when the technology of creating fake virtual people becomes a regular thing, and when this technology can use mined data to generate simulations of real-life users that, even if imperfect, will still have high resemblance to the originals?

  If such a development occurs, there will be no need for a vengeful AI — people will play the role on their own:

  * governments — targeting as many people as possible, level of simulation quality as high with the available funding (and current point on Moore's diagram) as possible
  * advertisers — targeting as many people as possible, level of simulation quality as high with the available funding as possible
  * neo-religions \ neo-religious cults — targeting only a few people as the minimum, but trying to make the simulations as high quality and accurate as possible. Such religions will have real, self-made “evidence” to back up their afterlife consequences blackmail for influencing believers and non-believers alike. 
  * [“rolling coalers”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_coal) — people who don’t think simulated minds should have any rights, and are pointedly simulating people on machines available to them to underline that point
  * gameplayers, lonely people, etc — imagine people 50 years from now who want to play a multiplayer game released in 2010s. How many of them will be ready to populate that game with simulated players, if they will have the means for it? Depending on the type of the MP game, the number of targets and the quality of simulations will vary.
  * etc, etc

  So my question is, doesn’t this mean that by our current point in time it should already be an advisable decision to delete all the social media accounts, make backup copies of all past e-mail correspondence and then delete the versions stored on the cloud, and to start taking online privacy much more seriously, [Stallman-style?](https://stallman.org/stallman-computing.html) 

  And what other measures would you see worth applying in addition, if this were the case?

  p.s. I don’t know if during the period when Roko’s basilisk was all the rage, the discussion was revolving mainly around a blackmailing AI or if it was more widespread than that. If if was the latter, and the subject of my comment has already been discussed — please link to the relevant discussion pages.

    The "while imperfect" here is kind of a cop-out. The simulations you could make of someone with 2070 technologies and Facebook access will be "imperfect simulations" in the same sense that tigers in Far Cry are an imperfect simulation of real-life tigers: they look like real ones, but most people wouldn't be especially broken up about torturing and killing them.

    If the practices you talk about emerge, they'll be closer to things like burning someone in effigy, or torturing someone's Sims avatar, things people do right now which aren't really tearing the fabric of society apart. I'm not worried.

    I think we have a "fake human interaction" crisis already, and unless we work against it now, it will get worse until it steadily undermines society's capacity to work towards really simulating human beings.

    So, errr, accelerationism now?  I dunno.

    I'm surprised nobodies given the obvious answer that if you've got the technology to create human level AI emulations of people then the world would be so drastically different as to render most of your points a bit irrelevant.            
    If you've got this kind of tech then for one nearly every biological human is suddenly economically worthless. In addition with lots of accelerated simulations of geniuses, technology should be progressing so rapidly that a full technological singularity ought to be right around the corner.

  I like worldbuilding and roleplaying, so is there anyone here who would like to play a game over Discord where we cooperatively create a fictional world? It’s called [Microscope](http://www.lamemage.com/microscope/) and I’ve had a lot of fun playing it with people online before. I have the PDF of both the rulebook and expansion for anyone interested.

  So... Avengers:Infinity War. Haven't watched other Avengers, but here:

  [spoilerz](#s " While it wasn't rational, Thanos clearly pursued his goal in a sensible way (although he could've communicated with his children more) and the goal itself makes sense from the antinatalist standpoint.")


  [spoilerz](#s "Of course, the worldbuilding is still comicbook-like and the stones powers aren't well-defined. Otherwise I would be yelling at Thanos 'why aren't you using stones to get other stones, come the fuck on'")

  [spoilerz](#s " Quill is an idiot and it's all his fault, couldn't he wait one second before punching Thanos until the glove was off *sigh*")
