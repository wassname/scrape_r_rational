## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  Some manga:

  - [Act-Age](https://manganelo.com/chapter/actage/chapter_1) - A girl tries out acting. She does a bit too well. Good story, great art, zero sexual anything so far.
  - [The Hero is Overpowered but Overly Cautious](https://mangakakalot.com/chapter/dz918039/chapter_1) - A goddess isekaies a dude to defeat a demon lord. He only engages when he becomes able to apply massive overkill. Great art, isn't particularly rational like the description may suggest, doesn't take itself seriously.
  - [That Girl Is Not Just Cute](https://mangakakalot.com/chapter/xy918167/chapter_1) - Wholesome teenage romance with no apparent overarching plot. Seems that the author just wanted to draw some dramatic face shots. The art is great too, so it works out well so far.

    Seconding Act-Age.  Amazing how emotional you can feel from this manga.

  - u/meterion:
    ```
    The world itself isn't *very* rational, but personally I think cautious hero has a decent streak of rationality in it. The protagonist actually takes reasonable precautions given his situation, and the mistakes he does make are reasonable for someone who doesn't know the meta-knowledge of the genre/narrative he's now in.

    [Also here's a link that doesn't have questionable ads baked into it :V](https://www.boredomsociety.xyz/titles/info/22)
    ```

      It has a little bit, but it's clearly being played for laughs, and the hero is in some ways going to nonsensical extremes - attempting to buy 3 sets of armour (a spare and a spare for the spare) is an amusing gag, except they can't carry that.

      Ultimately, I don't think it's going to last for very long, because the author will rapidly run out of ways to use the concept for jokes. It's not a bad manga, but taking the concept more seriously could have been pretty neat.
      ```

      - u/EliezerYudkowsky:
        ```
        Mad-Eye Moody is very hard to play very straight for very long, speaking as an author.  Preparation competes for screen time with action; and readers will vary widely in what they think is good preparation, so it's impossible to satisfy them that you're depicting the character the way they think a Moody should be played; and the hindsight is very strong with them, so any loss or setback will automatically be blamed on you having not written Moody well.
        ```

        - u/Flashbunny:
          ```
          That's fair. One approach would be to just not explain the preparations ahead of time, letting the reader guess what they will be - or wait and see.

          Alternatively, forcing the Moody into situations where they *have* to compromise/gamble, either due to lack of resources or information, or time. Then the Moody's failures aren't due to insufficient paranoia, but just... guessing wrong.
          ```

      - u/meterion:
        ```
        True, I'd like to think that the author is setting up for a joke with the third time he tries something like that (first being the armor, then the holy water) with the punchline being he was planning on using Rista's gate ability like an RPG's infinite inventory, which is why he doesn't see a problem with buying in bulk.

        As for how long it'll last, I guess we'll see! I'm cautiously optimistic (lol) it'll figure something out, considering people were commenting it'd run out of material to joke about since chapter two, and it's still going strong.
        ```

        - u/GeneralExtension:
          ```
          Well, we already have one established re-occurring gag, and that's probably not going to go away. >!And after the hero slew the demon king, he destroyed the world, just to be sure, that it would never return.!<

    Thank you for the Act-Age recommendation. I didn't get past the first chapter when it originally dropped, but I gave it another try and enjoyed it.
    ```

  - u/Flashbunny:
    ```
    That Girl Is Just Not Cute is 100% fluff, with absolutely no substance whatsoever. Which is fine, and your description is accurate, but I really feel it needs to be emphasised that the only thing this has going for it is seeing vague fluffy art interspersed with dramatic face shots - there is absolutely nothing else to the manga.

  Just finished the first season of [Made in Abyss](https://myanimelist.net/anime/34599/Made_in_Abyss) yesterday, and would overall give a strong recommendation, excepting some... peculiar choices by the makers. Nothing overtly sexual, and if you’re used to anime weirdness it’s not too bad, but enough that I’d hesitate to recommend it to a typical friend.

  Overall quality of the animation and sound design is incredibly high, and the story quite interesting, basically following two children on a quest to reach the bottom of [a large fantasy dungeon](https://i.imgur.com/dXRwiPm.jpg), leaving me excited for a follow-up. It does get darker and move violent as the season progresses, but not as bad as I’d been led to expect. If you could handle a somewhat more gruesome version of the [Nina Tucker](https://fma.fandom.com/wiki/Nina_Tucker) storyline from Fullmetal Alchemist, as well as graphic depictions of e.g. bones breaking and people being stabbed, you'd probably be fine.
  ```

  - u/sl236:
    ```
    Personally, I found the sexual aspects much milder than the violence and bodily harm in that show; the infamous bone breaking scene was incredibly uncomfortable to watch, in a "I'm glad I saw this show but 'enjoy' is really the wrong word for this experience" Clockwork Orange sort of way.

    I don't know if our culture is too accepting of extreme violence or too sensitive to sexual overtone, but it really does feel like there is an imbalance; nevertheless, both aspects would rule out showing this to normie friends for me.
    ```

  - u/GaBeRockKing:
    ```
    I loved made in abyss, but the rare semi-sexual humor is low on the list of reasons for "why I wouldn't recommend this to normie friends." The infamous "sfx:loli suffering" bit is the real reason.

    Great show though.
    ```

    - u/lillarty:
      ```
      This. I don't know why anyone would find an embarrassing punishment for a child to be more off-putting than the *child being tortured*. I get it that here in the West we tend to find potentially sexual content more objectionable than violent content, but come on.
      ```

      - u/tjhance:
        ```
        Part of it (in this case, anyway) is that the torture is clearly depicted as horrifying, whereas the weird sexual content seems to be played for laughs.
        ```

      - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
        ```
        A lot of manga readers seem to have their opinion influenced by events in later chapters I've only heard vague ominous references to, and many have the impression that the random child nudity/sexual jokes and the torture and suffering are two faces of the same coin, aka, that the author kinda gets off to drawing pedo snuff. Which, if true, is indeed rather disturbing.
        ```

  - u/wertwert765:
    ```
    Made In Abyss is a show I love very much, beautiful world, amazing music, but the random overly sexual attempts at "jokes" make it hard to recommend to anyone who is not into anime. So many Japanese shows have this problem and it bothers me a lot. I watched the first episode of seven deadly sins on Netflix and multiple times the protagonist groped a female character as a "joke" and it made me so uncomfortable I had to stop watching.
    ```

    - u/Cuz_Im_TFK:
      ```
      I guess I must be desensitized to it by now, because I can't even think of what you guys are talking about when it comes to sexual jokes in Made in Abyss. I think i remember the kids being naked at some point because their clothes got dirty or destroyed, but I seem to remember that being like when Goku was naked in early Dragonball or when there's naked toddlers in diaper commercials – it's assumed to be perfectly nonsexual, so they don't even bother with the "coincidental censorship" thing using steam, hair, etc. Was there something specific you guys were talking about that I'm not remembering? I remember their relationship being rather wholesome...

      Regarding 7DS, I agree that that the random *squeezing* in EP 1 was a bit much, but the show is worth continuing IMO. You should give it another chance unless even the smallest bit of provocative content is an issue for you, since this show has markedly less sexual humor than many other popular shows. For the record, Elizabeth is the only character he ever does something like that to and it turns out there's an important reason for that related to their character histories, so it's not as if he's doing it to a stranger, even if it may seem that way at first. The question of "why only her?" actually becomes a piece of evidence that there's something the viewer doesn't know yet about the relationship between those two characters and is even asked out loud by other characters in the show. It also leads the viewer's thoughts towards an important question and reveal later on in the story. 

      That said, I'm not going to defend the presence of sexual harassment in the show too far. I'm sure they could have cut it out and replaced it with something else to serve the same purpose which would make the story easier to recommend to your average western viewer, but in the current shounen anime industry, it seems stuff like that is practically required just to keep up with the competition since "everyone's doing it". It's just the medium-specific instance of "sex sells". The particulars may be a bit more offensive to western sensibilities than our own versions of this maxim, but a mismatch of sensibilities is a fairly common cross-cultural phenomenon.
      ```

      - u/wertwert765:
        ```
        In terms of sexual scenes in Made in Abyss that made me uncomfortable just from my own memory there was:

        1. Shoving a ruler up Reg's ass
        2. Teacher threatening to tie up Riko naked.
        3. Scene showing Riko naked tied up hanging from the air and struggling to get free. (Yikes)
        4. Adult character inspecting Reg's penis against his will.

        In terms of 7DS I wouldn't be surprised if there was a reason for it and it got better later, but yeah groping a distressed unconscious girl regardless of past relationship is fucked up and made me not feel particularly endeared to the protagonist.

        Normally I don't think I'm very sensitive to this kind of stuff, but man something about the casual brushing aside of sexual assault in 7DS just made me deeply uncomfortable.
        ```

        - u/Cuz_Im_TFK:
          ```
          Huh. While I don't remember the ruler instance, for whatever reason, my mind just isn't making the connection between Riko being tied up naked and anything sexual. I mean, she's a kid—a tomboyish one with a rebellious streak who has never displayed any awareness of mature male-female relations. So considering that she can't be grounded because she has to work and assuming that they don't want to just beat or whip her since it would be cruel or may prevent her from working or she wouldn't learn her lesson that way, an *embarrassing* punishment seems at least understandable, if not reasonable, to me. 

          If she were older and more mentally or physically developed, or if the males around her were not little boys with zero sexual awareness, it would *absolutely* not be okay. But because of her young age, the absence of the kind of "girly" reaction that sexually objectified female anime characters typically show during wardrobe malfunctions, and the artwork style that presents her as androgynously prepubescent child (her body shape is exactly the same as the boys'), it just doesn't feel like something offensive to me. More like naked toddlers in a diaper commercial or little naked village children running around in historical dramas.

          Now I'm wondering how much of my current mentality is just a result of desensitization and how much of it is an objective judgement. I'd like to say that I'm able to make a rational distinction between nudity and sexualization and that you're needlessly conflating the two, but it is indeed a fact that the squeezing scene in 7DS didn't bother me *quite* as much as it probably should have... Something to keep in mind for me going forward I guess.
          ```

          - u/Saffrin-chan:
            ```
            I think part of the disconnect for you is because none of the characters in universe consider it sexual, you don't realize that the audience is fully supposed to view it as such. One of the main... appeals(*barf*) of lolicon is that the childlike characters are too innocent and naive to know certain actions or behaviors can be sexual. Framing can tell the audience how they're supposed to react to a scene independently from the way characters are reacting in that scene, and made in abyss lingers on scenes of nude children *waaaay* too long for it to not be a bit questionable of the author's intentions.

            Also, I don't remember how explicit is was in the anime, but in the manga, the strung up naked scene is *absolutely* supposed to be viewed as sexual by the audience. [SUPER NSFW LINK, DO NOT CLICK ON UNLESS YOU'RE OKAY WITH SEEING A NUDE BUT BARELY COVERED BY HAIR LOLI](https://s5.mkklcdnv5.com/mangakakalot/m1/made_in_abyss/vol1_chapter_1_lq_oath_town_at_the_edge_of_the_abyss/25.jpg). Wow I even forgot one of the characters told her 'you can't become a bride anymore' and 'you don't even have pubic hair! I'm not interested in you' until I looked this up again. I couldn't read ahead in the manga after the anime finished because I didn't want to read something with shit like this in it. And it *is* worse and more apparent in the manga, but they didn't end up removing everything in the anime.

            And don't get me wrong, I think Made in Abyss has a great story. You just have to divorce the story and characters from some of the unfortunate framing. But the the shota and loli stuff detracts from it way too much for me to ever recommend it to someone who wasn't a lolicon themselves or desensitized to light lolicon by other anime.
            ```

            - u/Cuz_Im_TFK:
              ```
              Wow, that just seriously changed my view on the subject. When watching foreign media, I always take difference in cultural sensibilities into account and try to draw conclusions about those foreign sensibilities from the differences between them and western (or I guess more accurately, American) media. 

              When I was a kid and was watching Dragonball for the first time, I remember being surprised in one scene where child Goku was fully naked and they even drew a few curves to represent the genitalia since I'd never seen that in western cartoons before. But when it wasn't taken seriously within the context of the show, I must have come to the conclusion that "if the character is below a certain age or level of physical maturity, anime/Japanese people consider their bodies benign and not worthy of sexually-motivated censorship". This notion was reinforced for me when I saw a similar lack of censorship for children within Studio Ghibli movies (Princess Kaguya comes to mind as an example). 

              I don't think that conclusion is necessarily wrong either, but you're right that I did completely ignore the framing. Part of that is probably that I don't have enough knowledge about the particulars of visual media to even have a firm concept of "framing" within my mind (I'll only ever notice production or directorial techniques if they literally slap me in the face as being really cool or unusual), but I also probably put a bit too much confidence in the explanation I'd come up with without attempting to verify or disprove it. I was even aware that "lolicon" is a thing in Japan, but I never made the connection between it and the stuff that I'd seen. I guess I just assumed it was some deviant subculture I wasn't in contact with rather than something that subtly permeated even mainstream anime. 

              I guess it doesn't help that I don't really hold strong conservative morals to begin with and have some contempt for political correctness and censorship. I think the main issue though is that I tend to immerse myself in the worlds of the stories I'm reading/watching and accept the norms and moral standards of those worlds unless there's something that *seriously* offends my sensibilities (but if something ever gets bad enough to do that, it's usually not *meant* to be acceptable even in-universe). 

              For example, in a story I read recently, the MC and his love interest got married at 13-14 years old, but that didn't bother me at all. That said, I would *never* support something that like happening in America today. Similarly, I'll often cheer for a villain being killed by the MC even though I don't at all accept vigilantism and revenge killing within modern society. I don't think that's all that unusual though. Hanging an orphan up naked for breaking the rules seems plausible and reasonable within the circumstances of that orphanage in Made in Abyss, even though I'd never consider punishing a child in that way in reality, so I never really gave it any more thought.

              Anyway, thanks for the response. You gave me a new way of looking at things, but I'm afraid you may have damaged my ability to immerse myself in what I'm watching from now on, since I probably won't be able to help myself from noticing these kinds of production techniques in the future... Cheers

                I think for early Dragonball that's absolutely the case. The loli/shotacon undertones usually only come with certain specific types of shows and certain specific target demographics. Dragonball was a WSJ series, so mainly targeted at male teens. Which is why you get so many boob shots for Bulma instead. *Those* are definitely sexual, but of course they are, they're targeted at kids at the kind of age at which seeing a female nipple makes your day.

                Now, if you watch something like *No Game No Life*, for all that I think it's a really fun anime... yeah, all the lewd shots of Shiro, the 11 year old genius gamer girl? Those are totally lolicon.

      SDS imho is a pretty bad offender because it's not just a joke, it's also really unfunny. I don't mind immoral things happening for the sake of comedy - which is in general the case with groping or sexual harassment jokes. But usually you still get the sense that the author *disagrees* with those things. Even good ol' Muten Roshi from early Dragonball would usually get his just desserts for trying to cop a feel, he was more like the Wile E. Coyote of perversion than anything else. In SDS, Meliodas just keeps groping girls, and he's supposed to be a heroic protagonist. He's not even really ever called out for it, nor suffer any consequences. It's just "haha groping is funny because boobs".

  I've finished [Symbiote](https://farmerbob1.wordpress.com/2013/11/13/chapter-1-a-meeting-of-the-minds/) and [Set In Stone](https://setinstonestory.wordpress.com/2015/10/08/backstory-revamped-into-prologue/) since the most recent recommendation thread. What a set of fictions!

  I definitely enjoyed Set In Stone more than Symbiote, but both were quite good. Set In Stone just has such a unique flavor to it, something I haven't seen before.

  Does anyone have any recommendations for Audible? I just finished the Rivers of London series (or rather I am up to date on the series) and I thoroughly enjoyed it.
  ```

  - u/Izeinwinter:
    ```
    Looking through my audible library for things which are both good and were performed well:

    The Traitor Baru Cormorant 

    Ann Leckie, the ancillary series. All of it. The Raven Tower is also good, but the ancillary series takes priority in spades. 

    Jo Walton: The Just City, and sequels. 

    Marie Brennan, the Lady Trent series. 

    Less weighty, but lots of fun: 

    Jacqueline Carey: Santa Olivia and sequel

    Diana Rowland: White Trash Zombie

  - u/Farmerbob1:
    ```
    I recently read (listened to) and enjoyed Dennis E. Taylor's Bobiverse series.  Yes, the main characters' name is Bob.

    It is a mostly-rational fic with a few aspects of rationalism as flavor.  Bob basically dies, becomes a corpsesicle, and re-awakens in a dystopian future as the property of a morally reprehensible government.  The world is going to hell due to the damage humanity has done to it.  The world is abusing corpsicles to create electronic slaves for use in exploring the universe for potential colony sites.  Bob is a good little brain-in-a-box until he isn't.  Then things get interesting.
    ```

    - u/IICVX:
      ```
      The Bobiverse books are pretty good as long as you're not taking the sci-fi too seriously, because some of the things that are treated as "whoa" moments in the novels basically table stakes in other hard sci-fi. 

      The other thing to keep in mind about Bobiverse is that Bob's not that smart, and he never really puts a lot of effort in to getting smarter. Sure, he's able to jack up his personal frame rate and spend longer periods of time thinking, but he never improves himself so that he can think better. 

      >!This may be an intentional choice by the author, because the versions of Bob that *do* improve themselves in order to think better tend to stop being point of view characters and become Q-like "here's a new gadget for you have fun" supporting characters real quick.!<

    Thanks for the recommendations!

    Any chance you could sell the stories to us with a quick, spoiler free, blurb?
    ```

    - u/Dent7777:
      ```
      The premise of Symbiote is as follows:

      The Alien Argeon crash landed in area 51, and was approached by the US government. In exchange for assistance repairing it's ship, the alien gave the US government some alien technology. The key technology is a sentient, symbiotic organism that pairs with a human, giving that human a set of powerful new abilities. Once the ship was repaired, the government attempted to prevent the alien from leaving, and shot it down upon takeoff.

      Our story follows the protagonist Bob as he discovers that he has a symbiote named Frank. With the government in pursuit, Bob attempts to use his new ally and newfound abilities to protect himself and discover how deep the rabbit hole goes.

      The story has great action, a fast moving plot, creative use of a unique powerset, fairly rapid power creep, and decent dialogue. However, I would hesitate to call the story anything more than rational-adjacent. I would say this is a nice light read, entertaining and passingly well written for a fanfic.

      The premise of Set in Stone is clearly explained in the prologue located [here](https://setinstonestory.wordpress.com/2015/10/08/backstory-revamped-into-prologue/).

      This story is extremely well written in my opinion, with the care and attention needed to craft a truly rational fiction. The farm-centric Stonepunk nature of this fic is extremely unique and well done. The main character and supporting cast are simultaneously simple country folk and complex, intelligent, multifaceted characters.

      The main conflict in the fiction is logically coherent and yet comes off a little wooden at times. The conflict is part morality play, part rationalist experiment, a mainstay of rational fiction that remains an very difficult feature to fit into well written and well paced story.

      While Symbiote is entertaining and worth a look, Set In Stone is a grand slam of a rational fiction. I think it deserves a place on the podium if I were to rank my favorite "rational" fictions.
      ```

      - u/DangerouslyUnstable:
        ```
        Just binged set in stone after the top level recommendation. While I enjoyed it, I would not give it nearly the full throated endorsement you just did. The world building is amazing and the conflict and actions are indeed excellent examples of rational story writing with people who have well defined goals and pursue them in ways that make sense. But the dialogue. My God the dialogue. The author seemingly does not understand the idea of subtext. Everything, and I mean everything, is explicitly spelled out for the reader. There is zero trust that we can figure things out from context. It's written like it's for an alien that doesn't quite understand how human social dynamics work but is trying really hard to learn. And the fact of that matter is that VERY little happens. The entire plot of this story would be handled in the first 50 pages of some novels. Given how awesome the world was, the fact that so little happened felt like kind of a waste, like the author came up with s great universe and then couldn't figure out quite what to do with it.

        Like I said, I enjoyed it and I would recommend it to fans of rational fiction, but it definitely has some glaring flaws.

        And having been the one that recommended symbiote a few weeks ago, I have to say that these flaws seem to be a hallmark of his works. His world building and creativity are amazing, and his ability to write characters with clear goals who work towards them sensibly is great. But he needs to start work-shopping his dialogue or something. It's an unfortunate weak point in otherwise excellent examples of rational fiction.
        ```

        - u/ViceroyChobani:
          ```
          I would second this criticism, and extend it from dialogue into the descriptions used. Not only is every thought and idea communicated explicitly and at length, it seems like every single action the main character takes is broken down and listed step. by. step. 

          Sometimes this is good, but after finishing a sequence describing a trip to a bathhouse and being treated to a lengthy paragraph on how *exactly* the MC wrapped his towel and was careful to make sure his cameltote bag (which, by the way - boy did I misread that the first few times) was closed in exactly the right way...well. I think I’ll take a breather.
          ```

        - u/Dent7777:
          ```
          I agree that the worldbuilding was the strong point of Set In Stone but I wouldn't necessarily agree with your comments on the Dialogue. 

          I think that the dialogue isn't written in a typical style, but I don't think that is necessarily a bad thing.
          ```

    > Does anyone have any recommendations for Audible?

    I really like the [Cradle](https://www.audible.com/series/Cradle-Audiobooks/B07GVRN95T) series and the [Traveler's Gate](https://www.audible.com/series/The-Travelers-Gate-Trilogy-Audiobooks/B00ZJ2XR18) series, both by Will Wight. I'd had Cradle recommended on this subreddit and really enjoyed it.

    They're not Urban Fantasy like that Rivers of London series (which I quickly looked up), but the narrators for both are really good, especially Cradle. I'm rec'ing mostly because it's this sub, not because it's explicitly similar.

    Though, [The Dresden Files](https://www.audible.com/series/The-Dresden-Files-Audiobooks/B005NB2IG0) seems more similar to Rivers of London, being both Mystery and Urban Fantasy. The audiobooks for that are supposed to be really good, and I really need to get around to reading/listening to the series.

    Cradle is the only actually good Xianxia that I've read, and is really quite rational. The world makes sense, and all the characters try their best to solve their problems, and the main character often ends up solving things by being clever rather than raw power, since he's usually a lot weaker than everyone else. Definitely one of my favorite series now.

    (Xianxia magic is generally improving your magical core to perform magic, often by using the magic of the world, while also improving your body. There's a ton of really bad awful tropes in the genre though, and every one is trash except for Cradle, which is amazing. I know, because I tried a bunch after reading Cradle, and they sucked.)

    Traveler's Gate is also very good. It's much more Western in magical style. Not in the classical, DnD, do-anything Wizard, but like how various different Western magical fiction all have unique somewhat limited (in comparison to a do-everything wizard) magical systems. This trilogy is currently finished, though there will probably be future books at some point. This narrative arc is complete, anyway, and the series feels very well put-together.

    I've finally tried out the game [Sunless Skies](https://store.steampowered.com/app/596970/SUNLESS_SKIES/) recommended months ago, and I second the recommendation. The gameplay isn't particularly engaging and I'm not attached to the story, but I'm still enjoying it for the great and abundant worldbuilding. And even though I hate magical realism with a burning passion, in certain contexts I really appreciate it when a story drops evocative, fantastical aspects about the world but doesn't try to explain them much. 

    As an example, a passenger on my aether engine just told me about how the queen defeated the tyrant suns and acquired a treasure trove of time, which she uses for her own immortality as well as to reward to her faithful supporters for loyal service. My passenger hopes to be able to afford a small quantity of time once she retires, to stretch out her days of leisure. Very cool, right? 

    If anyone has any similar recommendations for a game, I would appreciate it.

      You're almost certainly aware of it, but the previous game Sunless Sea is at least as good. I haven't played Skies, but a review I read said that it felt like a letdown in terms of worldbuilding in comparison*, so if that's what drew you to Skies, Sea should hopefully blow you away.

      It's also got a submarine expansion for free!

    I read most of *Symbiote*, which was fairly unpolished but quite interesting, and I like reading unpolished work for improving my ability to recognize otherwise-subtle devices. The author has other works and *Set in Stone* is explicitly meant to be rational (links to both in /u/Dent7777's comment above) so I'm curious why his works don't seem to be brought up much here. Perhaps he hasn't put up anything new in the past few years?
    ```

    - u/Dent7777:
      ```
      I believe the reason behind /u/Farmerbob1's lack of notoriety is due to his recent inactivity in the realm of fiction. I've read that somewhere, you could find /u/Farmerbob1 cruising the highways and byways of America in a truck.

      I like to imagine that he is dictating the drafts of a great rational epic to his faithful dog, perfecting his work until he decides to hand his keys over and pick up the pen. 

      I think that *Set In Stone should* be in way more people's top five rational fiction lists. His combination of modern scientific structure, anachronistic farm life, and lifelike character narration are priceless. Unlike many rational fics, this one has a happy and fulfilling ending. 

      It knows when to cut off the story, when another author would have bloated the work with an enjoyable but ultimately plot-irrelevant set of additional chapters following the building of the main character's farm.
      This isn't to say that this story is short on worldbuilding, or that I wouldn't love reading about the main character's continuing story. The author just did a great job of bringing the story to close and neatly closing the central conflict.
      ```

      - u/Farmerbob1:

        Correct.  I have rarely been able to find enough time to write in the last couple years due to being an OTR truck driver and working 70-80+ hours a week.

        My typical writing style is to write in large blocks, anywhere from 8 to 20 hours at a time.

        That is very, very hard to do in my current job.  I live in a tractor trailer six weeks at a time, and my days off are pretty much jammed with non-driving things that I must do.  There's also the patent.

        Le Sigh.

        It's even worse now than before, since I own the truck that I am driving.  However, there are a couple potential changes in my life that I am working towards.

        I have hammered out most of the issues in the patent application and will be continuing it 'in-part' soon, which will allow me to sidestep a lot of the worst pedantic non-issues that are being seized upon by the examiner (it's their job.  Still annoying.)  If I can get that patent, I suspect I can wrangle my way into rapid retirement with it, while still ensuring it actually gets exploited and not buried.

        Failing that, I may also be able to start taking winters off once the truck is paid off.  Winter roads are more dangerous, fuel is winterized and less efficient due to additives, and mileage rates drop in the last half of winter, so I won't be losing a great deal if my truck is paid off.

        Stopping driving is not an option.  I'm addicted to the road now.  Even if I no longer drive commercially, I will have a RV or large cab truck and travel the country to see some of the incredible beauty from closer than the main roads.

        I have also been listening to a LOT of audiobooks, and considering how they were written.  From bad to good.  I have recently finished a series where the author had a tendency to write very, very stilted, unrealistic, conversation.  This is a problem I know I have had in the past, and one thing I need to address when I start writing again.

        That said, I have definitely been working over my next story fairly extensively in my head.  It's a return to the Reject Hero universe from the viewpoint of a powered individual with a body like a amalgam of Plastic Man and a clay Michelin man.  His most powerful ability is his appetite.  I fully intend it to be rational, but not rationalistic.

        When I finally do get extended time to write, I fully expect to web-publish the rough story at a rather high rate of speed.

        However, I cannot say when that will be.

        I also need to find a medium to write in.  Most forums are garbage to write in, and Google Docs is even worse.  Wordpress made a lot of changes that I really do not like since I last wrote original works actively.  There was a site called Jukeboz or something like that which looked interesting, but they shut down.

        When it starts looking like I might have time to write regularly again, I will start seriously looking at somewhere to publish a blogfic.

      Symbiote fairly unpolished?  You are being very generous.  Thank you!  I cringe when I read through relevant sections when it gets a comment (I still monitor it, checking for comments once or twice a month.)

      Despite it's flaws, however, it is, by far, the most highly read of the original stories I have written.  Even now, years after the last time it was updated, I still get 100+ hits a day pretty regularly.

      I eventually plan on merging Bob and Frank into the Reject Hero universe to let them play with superheroes.

      It won't be a Rob doing the insertion though, it will be B.  Ah, the benefits of having a near-deity character that can reasonably be expected to help protagonists to do extraordinary things that would otherwise be completely outside their abilities.

        Authors are likely to be more critical to his own work than their readers. I prefer your humility over exuberant praise from readers (which is ill-placed most of the time). Gonna check Symbiote soon. After reading Set in Stone, of course. Heard your work only today.

      - u/I_Probably_Think:
        ```
        I don't tend to carefully isolate things I like/dislike about works I read/experience, but here's just a couple of things I recall from my read (up through the first few chapters of Book 4):

         - I was quite impressed at the hard-sci-fi-ish quantitative details! I don't know how much general preferences vary on this, but I found that the detailed weights/dimensions/considerations were specified much more than I expected, but they were not generally too intrusive, and seemed more or less reasonable when I stopped to consider/imagine the details. That must have been a lot of work!
         - The reason I stopped reading was that I found it very hard to stomach the setup of the virtual world; once we saw Bob entering it post-arrest, it sounded a whole lot like a big single-instance superhero MMO (with private sublocations, sure). That seemed to me to be a very strange turn of events, and while upon reflection there were a few places (especially later in the story) where it seemed very difficult to find Watsonian explanations for characters' actions, this particular surprise seemed very hard to justify even on a Doylist level.
        ```

        - u/Farmerbob1:
          ```
          Yes.  The details of the virtual world, especially the cross-genre stuff that never went anywhere, was one of the parts of the story that I look back at with some degree of horror.

          Another cludge was Ayva.  I never did do enough retcon work to make her early appearance as Dart match up with her later character reveals as Ayva.

          I did make a strong effort to make the physics of what Bob and Frank did at least make mathematical sense, for those things that weren't partly constructed of balonium.  The initial body mods, armor, sling staff, etc.
          ```

            > I did make a strong effort to make the physics of what Bob and Frank did at least make mathematical sense, for those things that weren't partly constructed of balonium. The initial body mods, armor, sling staff, etc.

            This was definitely one of the draws for me! I thought the urchins were a really fun idea too, even if a bit handwavy on some of the details :D

    The MC's power creeps really quick in the most recent bit of the fanfic. I think it could lead to some interesting encounters but still, I see rapid power creep as somewhat of a red flag.

    With that hedge, I recommend it as an interesting, well-written Wormfic.

      > It was mildly amusing. There was no rational aspect.

      I mostly agree, but I'd argue that MC!Voldemort's seemingly insane approach to human interaction in this fiction actually makes a ton of  rational sense given his background. 

      He was handed off to an orphanage, and raised in a world where magic isn't real. Then eventually some dude comes by and tells him "Hey actually magic *is* real and also you're going to a magic school". He's then taken to a magic school, which is essentially an entirely different reality. 

      With **that** as your background, why would you assume that other things can't be real? Why spend time fighting people about some particular impossibility? Just accept that they believe it to be true, and act as if it were for the purposes of the current conversation. 

      If Lockhart claims to have defeated vampires in Albania while at the same time fighting wendigos in Australia, then what's more likely? He's lying, or he's somehow managed to cast a spell that allows him to duplicate his body? When magic is involved, it's genuinely impossible to know - so you're best off assuming the worst case.

        Even if it does, Rational fiction doesn't just mean that the main character's action make sense when taking their background into account. If it did I could write a fic of the Joker acting batshit crazy like the chaotic evil schmuck he is and call it a rational fiction.

        This fic was as rational as an average japanese harem comedy.

      I thought so too; it's very much played for comedy. That said, the postscript was a really interesting read and gave me an inkling of how much thought was put into maintaining characterization! All in all, the story was fun but I most enjoyed the postscript, to be honest.

  I posted this comment in last Friday's tread since not everyone here reads the Friday threads.

  A while ago, I wanted to read a deleted Harry Potter fanfic, specifically a deleted HPMOR fanfic.

  It took a while, but I managed to recover [Hermione Granger and the Tesseract of Merlin (Worm x HPMOR)](http://www.mediafire.com/folder/bwx8buculgy2h/Hermione_Granger_and_the_Tesseract_of_Merlin)!

  I did it by downloading the Harry Potter-specific zip from [fanfiction.net-repack](https://archive.org/details/fanfictiondotnet_repack) and finding the single story in it.

  For now, I have about 13 gigabytes of Harry Potter fanfiction downloaded to my computer and if there is anyone else who wants to look for a deleted story, I'm willing to look it up and share them if I have it. I'll probably delete them in a week or two. Make sure to include the author with the title if possible as well.

  I'm not taking down the story I spent time looking for though. That link's staying up there for as long as possible.

  How does everyone keep track of updates on the various fics they read?

  Some stuff gets posted here, but other stuff I've enjoyed does not. For instance, I'm now up to fate with WTC, PGTE, A Bad Name, Birds of a Feather, and half a dozen other fics scattered across fanfic sites, blogs, and forums. I've no idea how to keep track of it all.

  I'm worried I'm going to keep reading fics until I get up to date, then forgetting they exist because I'm not aware of the updates.

    WTC + Birds of a Feather are on AO3 which mean you can make an account and Subscribe to them for email notifications. Same thing for Spacebattles (A Bad Name). There's Watch Thread options for email notifications only when the author posts.

    I think PGTE requires RSS, but if you frequent this sub, you're not going to forget it exists. But if you really want to track the gamut, set up an RSS feed for the compatible sites and use something like [VisualPing](visualping.io) to detect webpage changes for obscure sites.

      It has some similarities to Hermione Granger and the Perfectly Reasonable Explanation or Applied Cultural Anthropology, and to Tabloid in the Spacebattles Worm fandom.

    Since I'm a pack-rat when it comes to data, I usually download them to Calibre with the plugin FanFicFare. This way, I can be sure that I won't forget that they exist as long as they are in my library. I also favorite/follow the stories by using my accounts on fanfiction.net, ao3, SV, and SB. For any webnovels on a website like WordPress, they almost always have an RSS feed to keep track of.

    The stuff that I usually have trouble following are webcomics since I follow so many that I dislike cluttering my emails with so many RSS feeds, so I just keep a list to bookmark and check in manually every few weeks to see what has updated.

From there on she munchkins her way up the food chain (and the levels of the dungeon she's in). A bit of cleverness, a lot of humour, and a scrappy protagonist you really want to root for. It's a very enjoyable ride.
