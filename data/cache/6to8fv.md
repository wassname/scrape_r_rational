  As soon as I read the end of that chapter, I was immediately struck by the possibility that that's the same stick Scar stole. He had no reason to hold onto it when it wouldn't work for him, and would totally rather just leave it outside wherever Rafiki lived instead of face the awkward conversation. Rafiki just figured it was an extraordinary turn of good luck that he got an identical stick the next day and failed to realise Scar gave it back.

  I mean, the spirits just giving him a new stick also works, but I hold out hopes for my prediction.

    Not saying whether you're right or wrong, but props for sticking your neck out and making a prediction!

    You just might get your answer 3 chapters from now. :3

      I love how you switched from thinking this would be a one-shot to hinting at events three chapters into the future.

  This is great, as always. I can't get enough of the Scar/Simba relationship. It's just so much fun. I'm going to be legitimately sad if their relationship crumbles irreparably. Of course, The real question is what will Simba think of Mufasa when he finds out that he is the cause of the drought (If that's actually the case). I'm also loving the fact that I'm wonderfully uncertain as to who will triumph? The forces of Scar or those of Mufasa? So far Scar seems to be winning. From my perspective his life seems to have improved massively since he killed his brother(Except for the drought which he might be able to fix and his own private uncertainties/ emotional issues which he seems to be coping decently well with)

    This is great to hear! That's exactly what I was going for. It's really hard for me to get the audience to really think and feel along with the characters - mostly I think people see my stories as 'cool', but they're never interesting to the point where I actually see them being discussed outside of the chapter threads themselves. Something to shoot for, I guess :)

  I liked the first chapter as a one-shoot, and was worried the next two wouldn't live up to it, but it seems I am wrong... things are proving to be interesting.

  One point that this fic makes interesting is we are uncertain how real the spirits are.  In Lion King canon, it is somewhat vague mysticism, maybe magic, maybe mundane.  In this fic, some of the powers of the spirits are confirmed, but it still leaves enough undetermined to make the character's investigation of spirits and magic interesting.

    Cheers! I really love the idea of magic as being a mysterious unknown force. Magic with rules ala Bandon Sanderson is great, but there's always a risk that if you explain too much, it loses the appeal of what makes magic so fascinating in the first place. 

    I'm actually planning to write a full novel at some point, with as fundamental thesis: What if superpowers/magic is real but people have no control or understanding of any of it and are terrified of their own abilities? I think something like that could be really cool.

  One of the things I'm really enjoying writing this story is that unlike NTBS, I don't have everything planned ahead - I mostly just start writing and see what happens. So with this chapter, I ran into a bit of an obstacle: In the previous chapter, Scar told Zira to trick Rafiki with a story about Simba having visions. 

  Then in this chapter, I thought "Wait that makes no sense, the real concern is the drought, so why not just say that?" But then I had Zira bring that up, and I realized that Scar was actually much smarter than I had given him credit for, because bringing up the drought gives Rafiki enough evidence to realize that Scar murdered Mufasa. It's always funny when your characters do things without you even realizing exactly why. :p

  Anyway, I'm curious how obvious these things are to the audience. Was it clear that Rafiki deduced the whole thing at the end of the chapter? Or was that a bit too vague?
  ```

  - u/Kosijenac:

    I think it was clear enoughthat Rafiki smelled a rat. You could tell by the way he suddenly got intrested enough to drop his duties as a spiritual advisor for the animals.
    ```

    - u/diraniola:
      ```
      I actually think the "spiritual advisor" excuse was just that, an excuse. Rafiki was rather close to Mufasa and already didn't like Scar, so when his friend died and his enemy took the throne in an outwardly legitimate way, rather than face it Rafiki went away to grieve and get high with the stoners of the animal kingdom. Realizing that Scar may be responsible for Mufasa's death gave Rafiki the drive to get back to work.
      ```

  - u/entropizer:
    ```
    It was clear Rafiki was suddenly interested due to what Zira said, but I didn't recognize what exactly made him interested. That's possibly okay though. I'm not sure if you have to explicitly spell it out, even if some readers might miss it. That gives people a stronger incentive to pay attention.
    ```
