## [Meta] Subreddit irc channel

### Post:

Hey there, so in regards to the failure of the slack chat-room to take off. Figured I'd set up an irc channel (#reddit-rational) over on freenode. If you don't know how to use an irc client, there's a web client over at http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=reddit-rational that will take you right to the channel.

### Comments:

  Was there a dedicated /r/rational slack, or are you talking about the general Less Wrong slack? The LW slack seems to be going fine, though [it's a bit hard] (http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Less_Wrong_Slack) to get to.
