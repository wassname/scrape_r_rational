  **Synopsis**

  Across the world, one hundred adolescents unexpectedly find themselves in possession of superpowers, running the gamut from conventional to world-breaking to annoyingly limited. But despite the diversity of powers, certain patterns emerge, and as the Children begin to find each other, they realize that the world itself may be in great peril.

  Heroes save the world, but will they succeed in being heroes?

    I'm happy that it's on your to-do list, at least! 

    (And considering the quality of r!animorphs, I'll be very interested to hear your criticism of HSTW)
