## [D] Friday Open Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could (possibly) be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.

  So last Saturday [Deep In Pact](https://www.doofmedia.com/deep-in-pact/), the podcast analysis of [Pact](https://pactwebserial.wordpress.com/), recorded their final episode covering Pact's epilogue, and to celebrate the occasion, they did a 24 hour livestream on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/doofmedia). They had fun activities like taking donations for charity in exchange for doing drinks or "Tarot readings" for listeners, Musical brainstorming, or roleplaying games. Special guests were Matt and Scott from We've Got Worm, JayManiac the author of Worm's [Entities as Audience surrogates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFvV0BvPtkg) theory, and the man Wildbow himself.

  Memorable moments were the two Aussies getting drunker and drunker because fans kept making them drink disgusting mixtures, their attempts at drawing fanart within 60 seconds, [Elliot's Barbered face](https://twitter.com/mediamdpodcast/status/1236801837631557632?s=21), the two of them fighting to stay awake after 24 hours of talking and drinking, and, of course, Wildbow's live interview. I didn't get to watch the whole thing live, but I'll be watching chunks of it here and there, and I think they're planning on doing a highlight reel on Youtube, as well as uploading their last episode to podcast apps sometime this week.

  It was great fun, but I already miss the two to three weekly podcasts which I listened to on my way to work.

  I got concerned about Corona in Germany around 1st of March. Thats when I set aside a couple hours and called immediate family members and talked about it with friends I see on the regular. 

  I shall note as a personal failure that I failed to call people not in this close group that are at risk or have immediate family thats at risk. Like my 70+ godmother or those friends I only talk to on a monthly basis with their parents. Best of luck to you all in the month to come, internet friends. Glad to have your company.

  So there was just an announcement at work that the government has mandated a 2 week shutdown because of COVID-19, starting today. It's a province-wide thing too, not just us.

  Guess I should start stocking up on essentials and get some sanitary wipes.

  I know there are people here into tabletop games. I've wanted to try playing some at some point online, but I usually just don't care about people in random discords to join their games. 

  Is there anyone here who organizes anything like that online which I might be interested in joining? Bonus points if the whole group is /rational-adjacent.

    The /r/rational discord linked in the sidebar has LFG channels and a large number of people are in games in some shape or another.

    Repping the [Blue Hoods](https://discord.gg/v45xQRr), the world's largest unified-campaign D&D discord server. It's West Marches style rather than longform campaign-based, but it scratches the itch for me and the community is great.

    Like this subreddit, it's also among the least toxic online spaces I know of, and makes an active effort to remain that way despite being a hub of nerd culture, which can often get pretty weird/hostile/unpleasant pretty quick.

  Sooooo who here LOVES puzzle books?

  Anyone here who also loves puzzle boxes?

  Codex Silenda is a child Kickstarter project of the two put together! It's a "a wooden, mechanical puzzle book where each page is a laser cut, 3D puzzle that must be solved in order to unlock it and progress to the next page."

  I can't really do it justice, but it's so awesome!!!! It sounded like it's perfect for this community since a lot of people here love solving puzzles and I really want them to meet all of their stretch goals.

  Go check it out!

    I’d get the toughest and/or smartest person I know to go poke at it, or just do it myself if it didn’t look particularly scary. An inanimate object that’s not obviously unsafe (ie very hot or very sharp) being unsafe is almost outside context for those time periods.

  Are there any actions or precautions a rationalist should take during this coronavirus pandemic that your average person likely isn't taking?

  Personally I don't see it as something worth panicking over. Let's say the chance of getting it is 10% and 2% of victims die. That's 0.2% risk of death. Probably less if young and healthy. Scary, but not much more than dying in a car crash or from cancer. Do you think my numbers are totally off?

  Edit: my numbers were way too low.

    I wouldn't take Death as the only significant threat.  Despite some countries deciding they'll just let 70% of their population get it eventually (IIRC, that's Germany & UK's plan), it really really sucks to get.

    People talk about the coronavirus (SARS-COV-2) as though you get it and then either die or recover.   Of the patients released from Hong Kong, some had a [20-30% drop in lunge function](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/health-environment/article/3074988/coronavirus-some-recovered-patients-may-have).

    >A review of lung scans of nine infected patients at Princess Margaret found patterns similar to frosted glass in all of them, suggesting there was organ damage.

    We don't know how often it causes permanent damage although 9/9 seems very frequent, and we don't know how long term that damage is, but so far I still haven't heard of anyone who's fully recovered with zero lung damage.  The closest we can compare to is SARS. [One article](https://www.thestar.com/life/health_wellness/2010/09/02/sars_survivors_struggle_with_symptoms_years_later.html) said SARS resulted in permanent effects for 88% of its survivors 4 years down the road.  Imagine just getting a disease, getting sick, and then never quite getting 100% better ever again for the rest of your life.

    ------

    Aside from just a permanent lung tax for the rest of your life, keep in mind that's just for the average 81% of cases that are mild.  If you're part of the 19% that have a worse case, you *need* oxygen. That means you already went a sustained period with lowered oxygen unless you've gotten really lucky on diagnosis.  If you're slow to get onto oxygen or the hospitals are too slammed for you to get oxygen (and all hospitals in the affected countries have been slammed, the only question is how much), you're maybe looking at some permanent damage to your brain, kidneys, and heart among other organs.  On top of more lung damage.

    Then there's also the unlucky 5% chance to need a ventilator.  As best I was able to find, anyone on a ventilator long term has a >50% rate of mortality within a year, although that's other causes.  

    -------

    So to combine these-  

    - 81% likely permanent lung damage  
    - 11% likely permanent lung damage, chance for brain, kidney, heart damage 
    - 5% go on a ventilator, 50-50 chance you die later, plus all the other organ damage  
    - 2% jackpot you die  

    That's quite a bit worse than just saying 'ah, 98% chance to be fine!'

    -------

    I would focus 100% on not getting it.

    As for what you can do, I'd say that you should take social distancing seriously and make sure the people you live/interact with frequently do so as well.    

    Also be willing to look stupid for a better chance at avoiding the virus, like wearing a mask and being fastidious with sanitation, even if the people around you aren't.

    You don't want to be saying two years from now, "I can't jog more than 50 feet without being winded for the rest of my life, but at least I didn't *look silly* by taking the supervirus more serious than my friends did."

      First-year respiratory student here.  I heartily concur that trying to get a disease more quickly is a terrible idea, but I'm less convinced where the scarring is concerned.  As the article notes, it's not clear to what extent this condition will be permanent, and SARS was a notably more brutal germ than this--which is part of the reason why it spread less effectively.  Also, it says two or three of a dozen Hong Kong patients showed decreased function--and doesn't mention how jacked up any of these patients' lungs were beforehand.  The disease is more likely to hospitalize people with existing conditions, and I could see coronavirus tearing up an already weak pair of lungs.

      Any protracted illness of the lungs can cause "anatomical alteration," as my textbooks put it.  They react to continual stress by deforming.  That's how COPD gets you.  However, we're not talking about a truly long-term stress here, so my barely-educated guess would be that at least some of that function might be restored by therapy.  But, y'know, first year student.  I've got a lot to learn.
      ```

    - u/CouteauBleu:
      ```
      I think you're neglecting some selection effects here, as in the people tested for lung damage are going to be ones whose symptoms were bad enough to get into hospital care.

      The part about hospital capacity overload is the more relevant, I think, besides the need to delay the infection until better treatment is developed for vulnerable populations.
      ```

      - u/xachariah:
        ```
        Sure, might be some selection effects.  We're still early so we've got no idea.

        But apparently SARS has a very high chance of causing permanent daamge.  I don't think the official name of SARS-COV-2 is just for show.
        ```

    - u/uwu-bob:

      Good points. I'm glad I posted because from the comments, I've realized I was very wrong about the danger of this.
      ```

  - u/Predictablicious:
    ```
    A young male has a [0.1% chance](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/STATS/table4c6.html) of dying in a whole year (actual probability varies per age, I'm simplifying here). If you get Corona you have a 0.2% chance (again number for the young) of dying in a month (rough duration estimate from incubation to recovery). It's like increasing your risk of death by ~~25~~12x in that month (i.e. the 0.1% base risk is for the year, it's much smaller per month).
    ```

  - u/VanPeer:

    https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-act-today-or-people-will-die-f4d3d9cd99ca

    Not sure where you are getting the 10% guesstimate. Without social distancing the chance of getting it is close 100% with exponential growth of infection. With adequate isolation that can be arbitrarily low. If you are young and healthy the main concern is passing it on your elderly family members.
    ```

    - u/uwu-bob:
      ```
      Really educational link, thanks. My 10% guesstimate was way outdated.
      ```

  - u/MilesSand:
    ```
    Let's instead say the chance of getting it is 75% and the death rate is  4%.

    That's 3% of everyone. 

    In other words the statistical expected value of how many people will die in your top 33.3 is 1 person in that case.

    At 0.2 that's 1 in your top 500.

    So yeah,  even at the too low estimate chances are someone you went to school with will be dead from coronavirus when it's all said and done (or someone you know about that well)

    And that's for everyone who is within the 0.2% population so even if you're lucky and nobody you know gets sick, most people you know will have e had someone they know to that degree die of it.


    That said, mortality rates are heavily skewed toward the elderly (80+ range) so for the most part it's likely to be someone in that range.

    > That's 0.2% risk of death. Probably less if young and healthy. Scary, but not much more than dying in a car crash or from cancer.

    Just taking those numbers at face value, that doesn't add up. 

    0.2% of the US is about 600.000 people. In 2019 about 40.000 died in car crashes in the US. That's a factor 15 difference.
    ```

    - u/mg115ca:
      ```
      I wonder what the effect of staying home due to the virus has on the odds of dying in car crashes. It probably still there (because a car could come through your front window) but it probably drops dramatically. Does anyone know a source for odds of a car accident in the home?
      ```

    - u/uwu-bob:
      ```
      It adds up fine if you consider lifetime risk. Still, point taken.
      ```

  - u/SvalbardCaretaker:
    ```
    You don't even need to make such a crude estimate. The numbers for older and predisposed people are pretty clear. 10% of getting it in the next year is very low estimate, Germany works on models of 70% of people getting it at some point. (source: Chancelor Merkel, not for the next year but overall). 

    Eg. yes if you are young+healthy you are fine. If you have any older friends or relatives, take care.

    By a PhD/MD who seems a bit more knowledgeable and grounded than most of the junk you read.  Speculates, based on the profile of the cruise ship and Wuhan cases, that up to 50% of the populace, or at least the young and healthy, might have the virus but be totally asymptomatic anyway.  This thing has been making the rounds, and I think it's very much worth reading.
    ```

  - u/RetardedWabbit:
    ```
    Here's the secret to boosting your immune system and resisting the effects of coronavirus:

    Work on getting in shape/fit, it's pretty obvious and everyone is saying it everywhere but your average person certainly isn't doing it. Especially if you think this is just a panic (experts say it isn't) you should reduce your risk of long term killers over time. 

    Change your eating habits to keep a healthy BMI, get 8 hours of quality sleep a day, and do cardio daily. I recommend jump roping in your basement or going for a run in a P95 respirator!
