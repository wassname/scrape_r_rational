## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

    Another book I’d like to read from “the same series” would be *Operational Manual For Your Body*.

    Possible chapters: knows bugs (and workarounds \ fixes), lesser-known capabilities, proper maintenance and damage prevention (short-term \ long-term), properties specific to your sub-model (this information can be partially harvested through DNA tests, I think, but still).

    The point is — it’s not that this information is not exactly available somewhere out there, but that it’s usually intended for professionals (GPs, specialised doctors, surgeons, therapists, etc), and not the “users” themselves. So you can’t just pick up a 300 — or, hell, even 600-page long book, and be sure that most of what you’ll need to know about your organism will be in there — relevant to everyday-life and for the entire human lifespan, and not in abstract-biology encyclopedia type of way. 

    Well, I, at least don’t know of any such books.

      If you don't mind paying a bit for it, uptodate.com has a lot of good stuff on basically every medical topic. They are primarily a site for doctors, and have both provider-oriented and patient-oriented articles; if you are in this sub you will probably end up preferring to read the provider-oriented (aka "enough attention span to look up words") version. Unfortunately it's only available as a subscription service; they have search and article abstracts for free, so I tend to subscribe for a month if I need to look something up, and then scrape anything that seems interesting before I cancel.
      ```

      - u/OutOfNiceUsernames:

        Thanks for the recommendation. 

        Their marketing-speak website describes it a bit too vaguely though: do they write their own articles, recommend high quality scientific studies, or maybe both and\or something else?
        ```

        - u/gwillen:
          ```
          They write their own articles with extensive references. My understanding is that their articles are considered top-quality; I learned about them when working on a medical website startup with doctors, and my impression is that most doctors use them.

  I've been watching the show Code Lyoko recently, and I realized that it's already pretty close to rational fiction. They could have shut down the super computer at the beginning, but that's more of a difference in systems of morality rather than something that was explicitly wrong. There are many times when if they had thought a bit more logically it would have worked out better (eg. Jeremie bringing the CDs he's made to the factory when there was any chance of needing them), but on the whole, the story actually does meet all the criteria.
  ```

    - u/gbear605:
      ```
      It's possible, but you'd have to make it a completely different show. With like Naruto, you can just make the characters act like real intelligent ninja would. For Code Lyoko, I don't even know what you'd change.

      - u/Sagebrysh:

        Okay so the gang discovers the XANA supercomputer and with Lyoko and Aelita. In the show, they do this whole 'threat of the week' thing where XANA attacks and they defeat it and rewind time to undo the damage that it did. Just like, unpacking that into "kids fighting a UFAI and trying to rescue their friend from inside a virtual world" running through all the implications of XANA and time travel and all of that instead of just glossing over it. It wouldn't be 'threat of the week' anymore, that structure would break down pretty much immediately, and there'd probably be a sort of Lensman Arms Race between XANA and the gang as time goes on. Could even have it culminate in XANA going full skynet and starting a widespread war on humanity.

        Just taking all the pieces the show has, and putting them into a rationalist framework, yields some really interesting potential stuff.
        ```

        - u/gbear605:
          ```
          One thing I noticed at the beginning was that the returns to past can't bring people back to life, so the implication is that every time they return to the past, a bunch of people who would've died in the next 24 hours suddenly drop dead.

          One solution is that it only can't bring back people who would remember the return to the past, but then why do they work so hard to save everyone? It could potentially be an ingrained sense of saving people that they haven't reconsidered.

          Another solution is that it only can't bring back people that were only killed because of the actions of XANA/the supercomputer, but that's somewhat confusing in the "who decides that" way.
          ```

          - u/trekie140:
            ```
            Well, in the show XANA very clearly had magic powers. It repeatedly *possessed* inanimate objects with no mechanical components like antique samurai armor and a teddy bear that grew giant-size. One time it somehow used indoor and outdoor light fixtures to control gravity, and in a later episode even took control of a doctor while the heroes were in a hospital. Even when they finally make Aelita human, XANA somehow made it so she'd die if they unplugged him.

            Rationalizing the time travel rules is the least of your problems, this stuff is actually important to the plot beyond justifying episodic stories. The method that comes to my mind is to say XANA created grey goo bots too small for current science to detect that can build things from the environment, but whatever has XANA trapped in that computer is preventing it from accessing more than a small amount of the machines at a time every week or so.

            If you went that route, though, it'd be easier to justify XANA's victims not coming back since the machines could be having an insidious effect on the people around the town whenever XANA gains control of some. It's just another kind of magic, but it's something and that level of technology would explain how they're able to eventually construct a human body for Aelita.

  So awhile back I wrote something of an anti-FAQ for "Nice Guys," here being used to refer to "Guys who bemoan the unfairness of the romantic world toward good, kind hearted guys like them." The point of the anti-FAQ is to try to explain the errors and biases in that perspective, and help them find a more useful/mature understanding of the opposite gender and the dating world.

  (Is Anti-FAQ the right label for that? I'm not quite sure what it means specifically, but FAQ seemed wrong since it's the hypothetical Nice Guy asking the questions and me answering them)

  I never published it because I got super busy with other projects before I could find others to proof read and give feedback on it, particularly people who consider themselves farther on the "MRA" side of the spectrum rather than the "SJW" one, if we use those acronyms to represent extremes.

  Finally figured I might as well offer anyone who's interested the chance to provide some feedback so I can maybe put it up sometime this month. All perspectives welcome, though if you consider yourself or have considered yourself at any point a Nice Guy, your feedback would be particularly helpful.

    > people who consider themselves farther on the "MRA" side of the spectrum rather than the "SJW" one, if we use those acronyms to represent extremes.

    My impression is that MRAs are moderates while PUAs are extremists. However, I'm well-acquainted with neither r/TheRedPill (PUAs) nor r/MensRights (MRAs), let alone r/MGTOW (though I usually upvote submissions from r/MensRights whenever they appear on r/all).

    I have/had a lot of warning flags for potential Nice Guyism, and yet completely avoided that particular failure state.  If that's a potentially useful perspective, I would be willing to beta read.  I have some degree of sympathy for people in that general grouping (more for adjacent failure states, but still), and cheer you on in this endeavor.

  Lately I've been on the lookout for good depictions of different types of psychological dysfunction--specifically depictions that are consistent and clear, instead of just "lulz they're crazy". Examples that come to mind so far are:

  *Bojack Horseman* and depression

  *Wilfred* and anxiety

  *Jessica Jones* and post-traumatic issues

  I almost want to include Crazy Ex Girlfriend in this list, but the protagonist of that show suffers from several different issues to varying degrees, so it's harder to get a sense of what is happening in her mind.

  Does anyone know of other pieces of fiction like this that are worth recommending?

    *Patriot* is a show that's only available on Amazon Prime, but it's probably one of my favorite shows in the last year. The main character is a deniable asset working at an industrial piping firm in order to have non-official cover for moving money to swing the Iranian election. He's also depressed and in the wake of a nervous breakdown. (The show itself is really weird, like Wes Anderson meets John LeCarre, and *some* of the characters are stylistic rather than being attempts at simulating real people.)

      I tried to get into that, but I had a hard time getting myself to believe that somebody as incompetent as the MC would be picked for this job. 

      (But maybe I just have too much faith in the CIA...)
      ```

      - u/alexanderwales:
        ```
        A lot of the show is about dysfunction, failure modes, and plans falling apart, which is part of what I like about it. I definitely think it's not for everyone.
        ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    I'd somewhat contest Bojack Horseman and depression: he definitely goes through bouts of it, but they're usually the result of his own self-sabotage, which in some cases comes from self-loathing, but also regularly comes from panic attacks and uncontrollable anxiety.

    His symptoms also come off as more manic than anything. Most people going through depression who want to avoid doing something will just stay home all day, whereas he just as often avoids doing something by taking random trips out of the city or wild partying and drug use.

    It's definitely an interesting show for examining mental dysfunction, but if I were diagnosing him Depression would not be my first thought, personally :)
    ```

    - u/Slapdash17:
      ```
      I was considering just saying "sadness", since that would also include Princess Carolyn and Diane (some say they're both depressed as well, but I disagree). Mania is an interesting thought, but the only thing keeping me from it is that every single insight into his thought life is hopelessness, despondency, etc. The times where he's manically pursued improvement (like S2E1, with the self help tapes), it was still obvious to everyone but him that he was still hiding from the sadness within him(in this case, dodging phone calls from his mother).

      But yeah, maybe depression doesn't fit as neatly as some other disorders might.
      ```

    - u/trekie140:
      ```
      Well, my decisions to not do what I knew I should do in the situation I was in (such as seek help) sure felt like self-sabotage. I figured self-loathing was one part of depression. The reason it happens differently for Bojack could just be due to his life and environment, he's arrogant and feels entitled to others' admiration because he's an actor living off royalties from his crappy 90s sitcom.

  It's basically my first exposure to the topic of Trump's Twitter posts, but the recent *covfefe* incident has me wondering if Trump has been intentionally using typos to manipulate the perception and publicity of his tweets. I mean:

  1) It is common knowledge that typos change the perception of a message, increasing the reader's sense of the spontaneity (and hence sincerity) of the message. (While, yes, decreasing their sense of the writer's formal education / intelligence.)

  2) A narrative of "the media makes fun of me for *stupid* things that don't matter", the sorts of inconsequential things that working guys like you do (like typos in tweets), is in Trump's favor.

  3) Getting cocky? A particularly blatant error (see #5), in a post about how "despite the media coverage...", later replaced with "guess what this typo means" and a "Yep, it's a conspiracy" from Spicer.

  4) Apparently he's been routinely misspelling Barack's name.

  5) The most recent one, "covfefe", does *not* strike me as a real typo - it (unlike the other typos of Trump's that I found reports of in a quick search) is not a correctly spelled word (IE, not an autocorrect error) and not a phonetic spelling. Also, I spend way too much time looking in detail at people's typos, when I see them, and "fefe" instead of "erage"... just... um, really? Probably not on QWERTY...

  6) Scott Adams puts forth that there's some evidence that Trump has a powerful grasp of a sort of low wit that could perhaps include techniques like this.

  On the "evidence against" side, of course, we have the base rate of typos in his posts and the difficulty of prosecuting a good conspiracy.

  Conclusion is that we should stop giving media attention to Trump's typos.

      He's certainly immunizing his opponents, but his supporters I've spoken to who aren't fascists or anarchists have been convinced that any arguments or evidence against their views are an insidious form of propaganda created by elitist intellectuals to manipulate people. Where can that ideological group go when irrational loyalty to an arbitrary list of beliefs and the people who promote them is the whole point?
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        Personally, I think tribalist behavior tends to actually center around lived experience.  The beliefs aren't the point.  The people gain loyalty by recognizing the lived experiences of the "tribe members", validating those experiences, and pledging to represent those members, those experiences, that tribe.

        Mind, in many cases, the Trump voters who aren't fascists, anarchists, or pretending they never supported the guy are petty-bourgeois.  As in, their lived experience is blah blah makers vs takers blah blah bootstraps blah blah we make this country run how dare you come after us blah blah.

        The real solution, and this applies to the Dems too, is not to have a society where people can live in a bubble, comfortable but ignorant of how their lifestyle materially comes about.

  **Printing several pages onto one piece of paper?**

  Embarrassingly silly and small question that I can't seem to find an answer through Google on, and there don't seem any good subreddits for:

  I've compiled some notes I want to have handy to refer to into a 16-page PDF. I want to shrink and rearrange those pages, to print 8 per side onto a standard sheet of paper, so that I can cut, staple, and fold it into a pocket-sized booklet. My last-ditch solution would be to hope a photocopy/print shop wouldn't charge much to accomplish that... But does anyone here know how to wrestle my doc into usable shape without having to pay cash?

  (My available computer is Linux-based. I'm generating the PDF by fiddling with an HTML doc mostly full of tables and 'printing' it to a file. Some further fiddling is probably going to improve its presentation, but if you've got an auto PDF-to-booklet script handy, or otherwise want to play with it, I've tossed my current draft [here](https://www.datapacrat.com/temp/Cniglic%20Test%201.pdf).)
  ```

    I think something from the pdfjam package may work for you:

    http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/firth/software/pdfjam

    In particular there's a tool called pdfjam-pocketmod, which "converts 8 pages from a single PDF file into a pocket-sized booklet". That's for a fancy layout where you can just fold the page directly into a booklet I think -- if you just want to shrink pages so you can cut them out, pdfnup is a tool for grouping every N PDF pages into one (read the name as "pdf-N-up".)
    ```

    - u/DataPacRat:
      ```
      That looks like just the tool I need...

      ... but I seem to have entered the yak-shaving stage.

      I have pdfjam installed; I just can't seem to get my copy to /do/ anything other than announce errors. For example, looking over the pdfjam-pocketmod script at http://tug.ctan.org/support/pdfjam/bin/pdfjam-pocketmod , I can manually enter the final command (replacing the variables with what I want done), but... if I don't enter an output filename, then it obviously doesn't work, but if I do enter an output filename, I get an error that the file with that filename doesn't exist. And, of course, neither the man page nor the website or any discussion I can find offers anything as simple as a working example of the pdfjam-pocketmod command.

      It's 3am locally; maybe I'll see whatever it is I'm missing after some sleep.

        Oh dear. :-\ If "-o filename" does not work, try "-o /dev/stdout > filename" ? What's the error you get in each case? Anyway good luck. Yakshaving sucks.
