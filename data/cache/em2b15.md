  The luck of one of the five totems appearing in the human octant is significant but not unbelievable.

  Them randomly wandering across it and it being protected by such a weak miniboss... that doesn't work for me, unless maybe the miniboss scales for the group that finds it, and any totems not found until day four will be much more difficult to claim.

  Also I am mildly concerned about protagonist-luck in terms of nothing having happened to randomly change their stats without explanation, like another team or race finding another totem would.
  ```

    It’s actually not that significant. With 5 totems and 8 quadrants, there’s a greater chance than not a species will have one in their territory.

    Based on how regular monster spawns seem to scale automatically based on proximity to other players, I wouldn’t be surprised if the miniboss did as well. It could also be a time-gated difficulty as you said. 

    Based on the wording of the totem’s message it makes sense for there not to have been any stat changes. The mapping skill confirmed that all the human players are still in their little starting quadrant, and totems specifically affect only your species, so they might not get any notification at all when another species activates one. 

    For me, our MC’s luck has been good but not unrealistic for making smart choices. If anything’s felt too good so far it’s that the group dynamics have been extremely smooth until now, but I can give that a pass.

      From last and this chapter:

      > [+1 Fire affinity for every player in Species Group-D in starter zone 14.]

      > “Have you checked your Fire affinity recently? You can thank us later.”

      > “What?  That was you?  My Fire affinity went up by 1,” the Russian accented man said.

        Right, I was responding specifically that it made sense for there to not have been any unexplained stat changes *to the protagonist*. If it turns out that there's a lot of those pillars around then I'll agree it's probably unrealistic that he also happened to find the first one.
        ```

  - u/Brell4Evar:
    ```
    I kind of see your point. The Obelisk of Fire was practically right on top of them if you consider the size of section 14. That's either incredible luck, or else the Arena did this for a reason that is currently unknowable.

    The appearance of the Obelisk on Ava's map also seems odd. Once it's discovered, the effect occurs, and then that's it. The appearance on the map hints that either the Obelisk has some continuing importance, or else its *location* is important. If location is significant, it could well be that the other Obelisks are arranged in Generation order around the central dungeon.

    The defense force of the Obelisk might scale up over time - or else, might not. Consider that each site will probably be in territory controlled by a different species. The PvP risk would be far greater by comparison, and would balance out the relatively light threat of the defending monsters.

    I think it's likely there are other rewards aside from Obelisks scattered about for explorers as well. Games such as *Heroes of Might and Magic* or *Master of Magic* are liberally sprinkled with ruins, caves, temples, and caches of treasure. Tygerion was inspired by this sort of thing.
    ```

      > I think it's likely there are other rewards aside from Obelisks scattered about for explorers as well.

      I agree, hence my other observation that it's unlikely the players wouldn't have gotten some other random arena-wide or species-wide or area-effect or whatever else based buff or debuff from someone else somewhere doing something, now that we know at least one such thing exists.

      Luck or whatever the principle is that a story is always about the most interesting characters, and if they were less interesting the story would be about someone else.
      ```

      - u/Brell4Evar:
        ```
        In support of the rarity theory: each of the 9 regions within section 14 take hours to cross according to the scale stated in this latest chapter. A feature that rare and potent is very unlikely to be within a half hour walk of camp. Even if an obelisk is within a species controlled area, the odds still look like less than a 1% chance on a random distribution.

        The exploration rewards offered so far have been food, medicine, and crude tools -- and have been revealed largely by Nathan's *Wilderness Survival II*. Maybe Matias, Gabriel, or Ava have this skill or its precursor.

        I can see encounter areas with lesser rewards (NPs, skills, gear, game hints). It could well be there are clues to the Obelisks scattered about as well.

        *Edit: Looking at the generation cycle (the story's title image), I can see that Fire is on the top position. Since Nathan's group is in the "North" (top) part of the human territory, the others might be also in their corresponding place. Maybe Tygerion is stacking the deck by placing all the obelisks around the humans?*

  Neat. I guess we can confirm that individual active healing skills can't be stacked, but they can synergize with passive ones. Based on the rough description of the play area, looks like my depiction of the whole arena as a bullseye was spot on, though I have to wonder why the author segmented the bullseye into sections of four rather than five, given the whole 5-element motif going on.

  Depending on their strategy, one of their best bets could be to try to find an adjacent elemental statue before another species does by assuming they're arranged roughly like a pentagram around the boss. Given the distance to get from the pillar to the center, they would be able to hit at least one more pillar before the time limit. +2 elemental affinity to their entire group is one of the best rewards we've seen. Now that they're going to build a shelter a lot of their group probably won't go for an aggressive strategy like that, though.
  ```

  - u/Brell4Evar:

    Founding a town is a BIG DEAL and will almost certainly come with NPs and other rewards for participants.

    With the constant pressure of the periodic monster attacks, fortification provides an enormous advantage. This same fortification will make inter-species rivalry far different for everyone. If "towns" are relatively safe spots, then crafting and gear will be far more readily available to the players.

    I'd also expect elementally-themed structures:

    * Wood: Farm, garden, or possibly orchard.

    * Fire: NP and/or EP generation

    * Earth: Walls and other hard defense

    * Metal: Forges or other industry

    * Water: A well, possibly with healing properties.

    These buildings may even enable limited new skill purchase using NPs.

    >+2 elemental affinity to their entire group is one of the best rewards we've seen

    Preach it! The damage resistance alone from these affinities makes them worthy of pursuit. Better EP caps and unlocking advanced skills far outstrips even this benefit.

    *Edit:*

    > I guess we can confirm that individual active healing skills can't be stacked, but they can synergize with passive ones.

    *I mathed this out in the response thread on Royal Road. The synergy isn't simply additive stacking. The two effects are multiplicative. Nathan would have a x9 recovery speed with an Advanced Healing I buff.  With more Water affinity and a higher skill, his recuperation would become near-instant.*
    ```

    - u/Brell4Evar:
      ```
      Having mulled this over a bit more, it'd be kind of neat if the generation cycle somehow aided city development.

      Water from the well -> 

      Wood from an orchard -> 

      Fire in a kiln ->

      Bricks to build a smithy ->

      Ore smelted for tools

      ... and so on.
      ```

    - u/meterion:
      ```
      I agree, everyone who contributes NP towards the first building is probably gonna get mad rewards. I guess it’ll be a question of how much to invest in static defenses based on the escalation of the past two days. They effectively only need to play defensively for day and a half, since on the fifth day they have to win against the boss or die. 

      With that in mind, NP investment in buildings is going to be NP that cant be used to increase skills. They can’t go too overboard on purchasing yet or they’ll be under leveled to fight the boss. There’s also the concern that if they all stick around a building to defend the monster spawns will consider them one group and everyone will be stuck running away from the building for spawns then back to defend centrally, which would make it difficult to forage.
      ```

      - u/Brell4Evar:
        ```
        I strongly suspect that there will be mechanisms for gaining NPs (implied by *Quick Study* skill) and even accelerating EP recovery in a town.

        The Immortal Collective seem to have constructed an enormous and brutal team-building exercise that also indoctrinates the winning species with their philosophy. A community (and, by extension, a town) should be more than the sum of its parts.
        ```

        - u/meterion:
          ```
          I agree, I just don't think it'll come into play for the first stage, at least, because the time limit is too short to make a long-term investment in static buildings worth it when you'll have to leave them behind for the next stage.
          ```

          - u/Brell4Evar:
            ```
            Will they need to leave them, though? The fact that the Arena is contiguous means that travel between zones should become a thing, probably sooner rather than later. Travel times might be greatly reduced depending on available skills and gear.

            For that matter, it may be desirable to build up if there are "low-hanging fruit" awards. Vendors were mentioned. Being able to sell nasty bedrolls and beaver horns for NPs looks very likely.
            ```

            - u/meterion:
              ```
              That's a good point. I was thinking that they would have to move to the second zone to continue, but on rereading I see now that they "unlock" the second zone by defeating the boss. In that case then yes, investing in buildings early could be an excellent move to make.
              ```

              - u/Brell4Evar:
                ```
                I may be wrong, but I suspect a lot of phase 2 will involve scavenging the other 3 connected outer regions. With 5 obelisks in the phase 2 region and a potential of 19 obelisks in available phase 1 regions, there's enormous incentive to go and back-fill their map.
                ```

    I'm honestly surprised this developed. It's a potentially powerful and unique role that is exclusive to one affinity. Water has healing, but *First Aid I* is available to pretty much everyone.
    ```

    - u/sparr:
      ```
      I expect to see things like siege weapons for Fire and other affinity-exclusive major things.

      I look forward to a situation where one race has to make a big sacrifice to protect the only person they have left with a particular affinity...
      ```

      - u/Brell4Evar:
        ```
        The collars make elemental affinity clear to anyone with a line of sight. Hiding them may not even be possible - consider that Nathan's wristband flowed around his glove. These devices will also make it clear when a battle is PvP rather than a monster attack.

        Tactics based on elements look to be a very promising tangent in the story. Destroy a species' Earth Primes early and they cannot fortify. Destroy their Water Primes and their healing capabilities are reduced. There are probably significant effects to eliminating other elements as well; we'll see.
        ```

  What happens if Nathan touches the obelisk a few minutes later, leading to him[*] being knocked out during the impending monster attack? Instadeath from an otherwise good thing? Until now it has always been an option to just ignore the interface any time it would be dangerous to be unexpectedly knocked out, but this breaks that pattern.

  [*] Going a step farther, why didn't anyone else notice that every human got hit by a nanite-knockout buff at the same time? Was the +1 so much less noticeable than the +2?
  ```

  - u/Brell4Evar:
    ```
    No way to know yet, but i'm guessing that everyone else got their affinity by reading a cached message, as normal.

    Ambushing enemies incapacitated by the upgrade process looks like a very effective tactic. This would also cost the ambushers the benefit of the obelisk, though.

    The more I think about it, the more convinced I am that the best action the humans can take is to found their city near the mid-zone dungeon, then immediately begin to tear into it. If they can kill the zone boss early, they'll control the entire region and be able to harvest it while the other outer region borders are still closed.

    Humans have one reasonably sure advantage in this contest - Nathan and Maya's knowledge of the games that inspire their challenge. Rivals will figure this out soon enough. It's already pretty certain that every other species will be Kill On Sight - and it's likely that at least some are physically far more capable.
