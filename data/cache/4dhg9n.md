  I played lot of interactive fiction recently and IMHO these are the best games of the genre:

  [Choice of Robots](https://www.choiceofgames.com/robots/) You are brilliant constructor creating new revolutionary type of robot. Your choices will shape your robot, your life and whole world. Lots of branching paths. Some events seems unavoidable but there is way to prevent them. Also, Singularity is an option.

  [Tin Star](https://www.choiceofgames.com/user-contributed/tin-star/) - Western. It's one of the longest interactive novels, but it doesn't sacrifice interactivity and has lots of ways to roleplay and choices that actually matters. It has Deus Ex wealth of options. If you want you can kill every major character or you can go through game talking your way out of problems and not killing anyone. Great characters, even simple bandits have depth.

  [80 Days](http://www.inklestudios.com/80days/) - steampunk retelling of *Around the World in 80 Days*. Really captures spirit of the novel with planning out routes, worrying about time and the misadventures of unfortunate Passepartout.

  **Homestuck** is in its final stretch. If you haven't checked it out until now, I highly recommend you do so. It's not rational, but it does have have and incredibly cohesive world, and very organic characters. It also uses it medium in a number of fascinating ways.

  - u/Cariyaga:
    ```
    Seconded. Worth noting is that it has quite a series of musical albums dedicated to it (some songs of which are used in animations) that are worth looking into even if you've no interest in the story. One of the musicians that worked on it, a fellow by the name of Toby Fox, is responsible for my favorite game which I'll shamelessly plug here: Undertale.
    ```

      On reread, right away. So many things you'd think are throwaway are super important, and others at least fill some later role. 

      First pass through, it helps to like the particular stye of absurdity. If you really don't like it at all, maybe it's not your cup of tea, period. If you can make it up to the opening credits without gritting your teeth, you're probably set to make it.

      Also... don't get too attached to normal astronomy.

      It varies. Maybe mid to late act 2? Either way, act 1 is a bit hit-or-miss, so I'd suggest withholding judgment for that. There's also a fan-made [audio version](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQ7JOidKp_xzsrVMGT1QFpjEavSkQMbV0) if you prefer that

  I caught this link here a while ago and loved it:  


  [A Succession of Bad Days](https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Graydon_Saunders_A_Succession_of_Bad_Days?id=tYyxCQAAQBAJ) - It's about a group of students learning to be wizards in an incredibly hazardous world with ~30k years of history and the results of hundreds of insane prior evil overloards genetic experiments roaming the countryside.  
  It's really unlike anything I've ever read before.

  The characters are fairly rational and the whole social and political situation seems like a rational response to the world.


  [Safely You Deliver](https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Graydon_Saunders_Safely_You_Deliver?id=Oju2CwAAQBAJ) is the third in the series with the same characters. (Just came out, reading it now)

  The first one in the series is [The March North](https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Graydon_Saunders_The_March_North?id=MoIOAwAAQBAJ), mentioned here for complteness.  Some of the characters are in the second books, but this one is not particularly "rational".
  ```

  - u/xamueljones:
    ```
    Just warning people here, read the offered sample of the chapter before you buy it. The author writes in a very unusual way which is hard to describe, but one consequence is that there are no or very few pronouns (he, she) in the entire book which can be very confusing for readers.

    Also, thanks so much SaintPeter74! I was the one to recommend the series on the subreddit before and didn't realize there's another book out.

    By the way, do you know if there's a way to track or follow authors on Google Play? There doesn't seem to be an obvious way to do it, but you are posting about the book the day after it was released, so you must have some way to do so.
    ```

    - u/SaintPeter74:
      ```
      I wish that there were.  I enjoyed the first two so much that I tracked down the author to his [blog](http://dubiousprospects.blogspot.com/) where I posted inquiring about updates.  He replied that the blog was about as good as it gets, so I added it to my RSS feed and pre-ordered the next book when it came out.

      The good news is that book 4 is in the process of being written.

      Yeah, I should have added a warning about the writing style.  It is very hard to describe.  I find that I have to put my full attention into reading in order to not miss something - his sentences seem to zig when they should zag.  I did find that maybe 1/4 of the way through I grew somewhat accustomed to it.  The underlying content is such a delight that I am more than willing to put up with an idiosyncratic writing style.
      ```

    - u/whywhisperwhy:
      ```
      At what point does an author's "unusual style" become poor writing? Serious question, not trying to be inflammatory. I read about 60 pages in so far and I do think I'll keep reading, but as you said I think the author writes confusingly and it's not due to clever perspective or because what they're describing is innately complicated.

      I say this as someone who's liked books in the past that are full of wide swathes of stream of consciousness or of classics which can be confusing due to their older dialect/context... I'm just not sure where to draw the line.

  I'm currently taking a break from it (it's really long) but I'd like to throw my hat in the already-full-of-hats Worm ring.  Worm is seriously great.  Among the best superhero stories I've ever seen, and maybe the best serial fiction I've ever read.  Please make it a (good) TV series, Hollywood.  Actually, no, I think anime would suit it better than live action.  Make it happen.

  Steven Universe. It's an amazing show. It's almost if not just as good as Avatar the Last Airbender.

  Also, I've been reading "The World is Your Oyster, The Universe is Your Namesake" which is a Steven Universe fanfic which diverges from the canon storyline after the end of season 2. It's very good.
  ```

  - u/SvalbardCaretaker:
    ```
    Would argue that some of the Steven Universe content is wayyy better than Avatar. At its best it has gems like this clip for example:

    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8I2j2TkWAA

    "Humans just lead short, boring, insignificant lives, so they make up stories to feel like they're a part of something bigger. They want to blame all the world's problems on some single enemy they can fight, instead of a complex network of interrelated forces beyond anyone's control."

  Practical guide for Evil. A little bit SJW but it is a nice story where characters knows the meta tropes of a fantasy story in advance. 
  Even made a 
  [map](https://www.reddit.com/r/mapmaking/comments/4dflkd/finished_my_map_nitpicks_are_welcome/) for it.

  Chiaroscuro is an awesome Naruto fanfic. I like how they raffigure Kakashi. 

  Currently reading Twig. It's 1921 full of Frankestein monsters made byt the writer of Worms. The main character is an experiemnt with a brain that works better then that of most people.

  In Fire Forged is a nice Naruto fanfic with a heavely lore rewrite (people become Genin at 15, if you fail Jonin test you are not returned to accademy) to make the world more logical.

    I read all of "A Practical Guide To Evil" a couple of weeks ago; pretty fantastic, though I wish more was out! The only part that stuck out for me about it being "a little bit SJW" was that the main character is bisexual, and openly announces that (although it takes a while). 

    I also really enjoyed the "Hero" chapter interludes in book 2, especially the one talking about why Good needs to win over Evil. Up until that point I was thinking "Man, Evil is pretty good!" But Bard convincingly points out that this is a deviation from the regular behavior of Evil. At its best, Evil is efficient; at its worst, it's brutally genocidal. So while the Empire might be a better place to live in now than Callow was, there's no guarantee that it'll stay that way - and if history is any indication, when that pendulum shifts, lots of innocent people are going to get massacred.
    ```

    - u/hoja_nasredin:
      ```
      That is actualy also one of my favorite part. Because it make sense, they make a very good point. The "good" are not just lawfl stupid, they are characters you can understand.
      ```

    - u/serge_cell:
      ```
      However there is no indication that Good is less genocidal towards evil. It's possibly genocidal toward species like orcs and undeads. Could even be that Good vs Evil actually mean pro-humans vs  "tolerate species  - incompatible with / revolting to  - humans"

      I had my internet education on 4chan and worse. 


      About SJW thematics, I don't consider it a bad thing but: the cast is 50% male 50% female. Most  people whose sexual orientation is known are not straight. In background we have orcs who were oppressed for thousand of years and now that they can go to shcool are demonstrating to be as smart as humans. All the noble, privileged people encountered so far are evil. 


      This is from the top of my head, if you want I can try to think of more aspects.
      ```

      - u/usui_no_jikan:
        ```
        Not only the orcs, but also the goblins, who were oppressed. The inclusion of orcs and goblins became the turning point for one the countries, making it significantly stronger.

        An anti-SJW point may be that orcs and goblins are actually as savage as indicated, and that should they live in our world, I would have no desire whatsoever to preserve their cultures.
        ```

        - u/JackStargazer:

          >An anti-SJW point may be that orcs and goblins are actually as savage as indicated, and that should they live in our world, I would have no desire whatsoever to preserve their cultures.

          Ah, but in a world where war between Good and Evil is a fact of life, you probably would if you were a pragmatic villain. 

          And its clear that, although parts of their culture have been preserved, they have largely assimilated into the greater culture at this point.

          There is also very clear racism on the part of pretty much everyone not directly allied with the main character, including both other Villains and Heroes. Basically every race or group gets a bit of it at some point.
          ```

      - u/FuguofAnotherWorld:
        ```
        Is that all it takes to count as SJW? I mean, it's not like the story is all "This is the right way for things to be and if you disagree you're wrong", it's just showing the stuff like that and then ignoring it. I guess I figured SJW needed a more active component.
        ```

        - u/hoja_nasredin:
          ```
          "A little bit SJW" GOD and It is not a bad thing. It adresses important social problems rarely adressed in fantasy. Of course I call it SJW. 

          "This is the right way for things to be and if you disagree you're wrong" Last time sone inside the story tried to disagree and protest the social changes she was thrown out of a window with no warning given...

  As many of you know, Dragon Ball Z is one of the the least rational story/settings you can find that isn't a parody of another setting.

  However, [Dragon Ball Z Abridged by Team Four Star](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nYozPLpJRE&list=PL6EC7B047181AD013) is a hilarious parody of it.  It isn't rational/rationalist itself, but it highlights the irrationality of the original in a funny way.  The quality improves greatly as the series progresses, but it's a bit rough at first.  Also, many, but not all, of the jokes require familiarity with the source material.

    This is a pretty good one, though I've only read the first arc so far.  Found it exceptionally grounded.  

    Though, speaking as someone who has lived his whole life in North Dakota, having been born in Bismarck and currently going to college in Fargo, it gets a bit weird when the state or the city gets referred to as this barren winter wasteland with only a smidgen of civilization.  It sometimes feels like we're not talking about the same place.  I did like that the recent oil boom was integrated into the story, with the huge influx of people moving into the state for that, as that is absolutely what happened.  

    I discovered this fic at random, just looking through recent Madoka updates on ff.net for something half-decent, and this caught my attention purely because it happened in my home state.  Was pretty pleasantly suprised at the writing quality, and the update rate is great.

  A serial fantasy novel set in a world where magic is real and magical spells are valuable intellectual property jealously guarded by the corporations and magi that created them. Kyle is a working corporate mage. His day job coaxing fragile magical equipment to continue operating is pure drudgery, but when he discovers a new and powerful spell he thinks he has it made. In this world, if youâ€™ve got access to enough raw magical current you can live for hundreds of years,  so it shouldnâ€™t be any surprise that the competition is starting to get a little medieval.

It's April 10th and the site is still up, so I've concluded that there was something flawed in that in that particular data point. However, the site could go away any time.

  Well, seeing as my most recent obsessions have all been Roleplaying Quests on SufficientVelocity, I'll list some of the best ones I've found.  Here's an [Intro to Questing](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/intro-to-questing.12494/), for those who don't know. 

  - **[Marked for Death: A Rational Naruto Quest](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/marked-for-death-a-rational-naruto-quest.24481/)** -  This one has been posted here a few times.  Written by Velorien and EagleJarl, with two other guys helping with mechanics and worldbuilding.  Out of all the quests I've found, this is still absolutely my favorite.  Great worldbuilding, unexpectedly brilliant mechanics system, and expectedly great writing.  Updates twice a week, and in need of more regular contributors.  

  - **[A Man's Dream Never Dies: A One Piece Quest](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/a-man%E2%80%99s-dream-never-dies-a-one-piece-quest.23728/)** - I've never really checked out One Piece, so I was wary about this one, but the writing quality quickly won me over.  This Quest follows the journey of the pirate Morgan D. Bartholomew, the Captain of the Black Suit Pirates and known throughout the world as Black Bart.  The story starts in the aftermath of your ship being attacked and destroyed by Admiral Kizaru, with your whole crew either dead or captured, and Bart being critically wounded.  But this is no reason to give up.  Your dream is to become the Pirate King, and nothing short of death will stop you from achieving that.  This quest is something of a Shounen/Seinin story, and the writing is extremely good.  We just passed the Timeskip, with a new arc just getting started, so it's a good time to jump in.

  - **[SayakaQuest](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Roleplay/SayakaQuest)** - Complete. This quest takes place in the Madoka Magica universe, from the perspective of Sayaka Miki, [PMMM spoilers](/s "starting the morning after she becomes a magical girl and saves Madoka and Hitomi").  Words fail me when trying to describe this thing, but just know that it will always be one of my all-time favorites.  The original designs of the Witches and Labyrinths are extremely impressive, creatively speaking, and I thoroughly enjoyed the whole thing.  Here's the [Story Only Thread](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/sayakaquest-story-only-thread.9401/), which has all the material for the first 10 parts, and you can find the rest in the index on the first page.

  - **[Puella Magi Adfligo Systema](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/puella-magi-adfligo-systema-story-only.9091/)** - Another Madoka Magica quest. This one's by far the most popular quest on the list, amassing a huge regular following and sitting as the largest quest thread on the entire website by a comfortable margin.  Story starts with a girl named Sabrina waking up in the streets of the Madoka-verse in critical condition.  She cannot remember anything about her past, but does have full knowledge of all Madoka canon, including the Walpurgisnacht and the whole Incubator system, and is determined to stop the incoming disaster from happening.  The writing of this one is really quite fantastic, and the questers have done a pretty good job with everything so far.

    Backing up the recs for PMAS and SayakaQuest. The latter is shounen but in a good way. The former is surprisingly scientific in the way the players interact with the world and the writer works very hard to make the world react realistically. Obviously since I help out with Marked for Death I can't exactly give a non-biased rec but I've certainly been enjoying it.

    Maybe I should look into A Man's Dream, since it's being recced alongside 3 other things that I enjoy.

  Some fun pieces of original fiction available for free on [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/browse/scores/top), in no particular order... (The word counts are somewhat incorrect, since I haven't bothered to remove Project Gutenberg's headers and footers from most of the files.)

  \- The D'Artagnan Romances (1m words): *[The Three Musketeers](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1257)* (233k words) is a very fun action story, and Project Gutenberg's translation of it is nicely lively. Its translations of the other books in the series ([1](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1259) [2](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2609) [3](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2681) [4](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2710) [5](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2759)) aren't the best, nor are those stories' plots quite as entertaining (so much court intrigue!)--but they're still interesting to read.  
  \- *[The Financier](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1840)* (198k words) is an extremely interesting story that details the rise of a prominent Philadelphian banker in the middle of the nineteenth century. Irksomely, however, in [the sequel](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3629) the protagonist seems merely to repeat the errors that he committed in the first book; I've twice failed to complete it.  
  \- *[A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/86)* (122k words): A nicely-funny story about a person's attempting to bring technology into medieval England.  
  \- *[Ben-Hur](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2145)* (202k words): A surprisingly-fun historical novel that doesn't get boring until it starts in the later chapters to deal with the religious stuff that the reader was expecting to show up much sooner. "Down Eros, up Mars!"  
  \- *[Carmilla](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10007)* (31k words): A nice little vampire story.  
  \- *[Dracula](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/345)* (164k words): A longer vampire story.

  \- *[The Lusiads](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32528)* (165k words): An epic poem for *Portugal!*  
  \- *[The Thirty-Nine Steps](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/558)* (44k words): A fun little adventure story.  
  \- *[Trilby](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/39858)* (106k words): Mind control in the nineteenth century.  
  \- *[The Way We Live Now](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5231)* (358k words): British aristocrats being unbearably stupid. (I cringed out at the end of Chapter Forty-Nine, personally.)

    I'll second the recommendation for the Dumas books (Three musketeers and the rest of the books). They're a lot of fun and the historical aspects of it is well researched for the most part (there are some editions with a lot of footnotes detailing the historical aspects which are great). 

    Ivanhoe is also a great read.

    Outside of Project Guntenberg, if you're interested in historical fiction, I recommend Azincourt by Bernard Cornwell

  I'm going to trust to the idea that there's some inscrutable similarity of thought pattern between people reading here, and that things I like that aren't necessarily "rational" will have good odds of also being things you might like... so these might be a bit all over the place. I figure that's more interesting than rounding up the HPMOR continuation-fics again.

  * [*Frequently Asked Questions About Time Travel*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequently_Asked_Questions_About_Time_Travel) 

  Not sure how easy it is to find a copy to watch, but it will be a fun time for anyone who enjoys time travel movies and comedy. What with it being a comedic time travel movie. No promises with regards to the absence of plot holes, except that I was too busy enjoying it to notice them.

  * [A youtuber going by lindybeige](https://www.youtube.com/user/lindybeige/videos?flow=list&view=0&sort=da) 

  I've recently been enjoying working my way slowly through the back catalog of videos from this guy - he talks a lot about medieval/ancient weapons and tactics, with emphasis on the fact that most fighters from the period would have been quite invested in staying alive. So contrary to Hollywood opinion, one doesn't [rush in recklessly](https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://i.imgur.com/agtRUV9.gifv); great care is taken to avoid the pointy bits of enemy weapons where possible.  

  Endearing old-school-youtube style of turning on the camera then going on a bit of a rambling discourse with tangents, while frequently saying "I should really start scripting these" and "I forgot a bit from last time, here's one more point on that". Also occasionally talks about swing dance and other matters, because he is a man of many interests (but those can be easily spotted and skipped if you're not into that). 

  * *Better Call Saul* 

  Has been my TV program of choice lately, is pretty good from a "creative solutions to problems" stand-point, and also excellent from a "cinematography and general TV-making" standpoint. Doesn't *require* having seen *Breaking Bad* but as a prequel it will make more sense that way, and also Breaking Bad is very good so I feel no qualms suggesting you watch that too.

  I really enjoy reading Jonathan Strahan's *[The Best Science Fiction and Fantasy of the Year](http://www.solarisbooks.com/post/575)* anthologies. Here are two of the memorable stories from last years anthology which are available for free courtesy of tor.com:

  *[The Insects of Love](http://www.tor.com/2014/05/28/the-insects-of-love-genevieve-valentine/)* by Genevieve Valentine: One sister goes disappears into the desert, the other tries to piece together her life to find out why. Her journey is complicated by multiple realities and a lack of clarity about what's real and what isn't. The end is left open to interpretation, but I think clever readers are intended to figure out a specific timeline/history (I'm apparently only half-clever, and am hoping some of you will read this and discuss theories about what happens!).

  *[The Devil in America](http://www.tor.com/2014/04/02/the-devil-in-america-kai-ashante-wilson/)* by Kai Ashante Wilson: A story about a black family living tinged with magic, living in the American south in 1877, and their daughter that makes a deal with the devil. This story is pretty racially charged and gets graphic, but is a good read. I really enjoy settings like this (and other things like O Brother, Where Art Thou? and the first season of True Detective) because they tend to feature a really sinister form of evil that I find both terrifying and riveting.

  I would write more but am about to board my plane!

  I'm loving all the [short stories by Rosamund Hodge](http://www.rosamundhodge.net/short-stories/). They're not exactly 'rational', but they're all without exception clever, moving, and colourful. Strongly recommended, given how short they all are.

  Haven't tried her books yet but that'd be the next thing on the list.
