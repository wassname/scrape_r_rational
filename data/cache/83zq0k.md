  Hey, all; I recently discovered this sub and noticed that my story had been posted here (a couple times in fact!), so I figured I'd let you all know that it's now complete. I wouldn't have posted it here, or tagged it as "rational" or "rationalist" myself--I don't really consider myself part of the rationalist community per se--but since it was posted with that tag last time, hey, who am I to disagree? Please enjoy, and look forward to the sequel, *A Thousand Shattered Mirrors*, coming soon!

    Keep at it man. Probably the best Index thing I've read.

  I was really excited to see Othinus... with the way some of the odder/zanier elements of canon had been downplayed or removed (Maika going to maid school or Imagine Breaker being labeled level 0 by academy city or Imagine Breaker having ambiguous or changing limits or Kuroko being harassement levels of clingy), I was worried Othinus might be cut out in the name of world building.  I am looking forward to seeing a rational take Othinus!
