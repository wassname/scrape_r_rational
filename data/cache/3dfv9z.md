  Aeria is a vast and strange world, islands of stone and earth float ponderously through unending skies. In anticipation of the release of my first novel, I will be publicly releasing a series of short stories providing more background information on Aeria and its inhabitants. If you're interested in beta reading the actual novel, send me a PM, otherwise, I hope you enjoy my writing.
