## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding and Writing Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*
* Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is *also* the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday Recommendation thead)

  I'm working on building a map that might be easier to build if I were pulling approximate data from real-life GIS systems, so two questions:

  - What is your favorite city built in glacial fjords? I'm looking for interesting terrain, high contrasts of elevation, and big buildings.
  - Are there any examples of cities built in the crevasses where rivers from a high plain erode the plain down to the ocean level, and the shoreline is a mix of cliffs and eroded plain?

    I'm partial to something like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/m40j3c/bulandet_norway/) or [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/MostBeautiful/comments/9o2ima/fjords_norway_photo_by_umbetravel_ig/). Not practical perhaps, but aesthetic and unique.

    > built in the crevasses 

    Not sure about this one, but it reminded me of [Constantine, Algeria](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/69/Constantine_vue_du_ciel.jpg).

  A magic system I thought up. Feedback welcome.



  Bloodline mages, also called kyesoma, are women who have the ability to alter the development of a child growing in her own womb. This would be set in an alternate fantasy world where genetic heritability is overall very similar to our own, but abstracted the closer you look. In this world:

  - There are no genes or chromosomes, a person will simply have a collection of active and passive traits, which a keysoma sees as a type of code. 
  - There is no instinctual knowledge of what code corresponds to what specific trait. This is something that they would have to painstainkingly develop the understanding of, mostly by trial and error.
  - It is physically impossible for conception to occur without physical, penetrative sex. 
  - Artificial insemination is impossible, as well as anything in vitro, and no manipulation of a person's 'traits' is possible outside the womb. 

  A Kyesoma can choose whether she gets pregnant or not. She can deny pregnancy with a 100% certainty, but inducing conception is considerably lower and depends on the woman's particular skill level.

  Starting with conception, a skilled bloodline mage can choose which parent's traits get passed on to the developing embryo. Making a clone by choosing only 1 parent's traits, for example, is theoretically possible but impossible at current skill/knowledge levels, as the opportunity for even a greatly skilled kyesoma to exert her power over traits is greatly limited by time. Consequently Kyesoma tend to use this limited opportunity to first prune out any obvious undesirable traits, and the remaining time to select for any particularly desirable traits that matches her intentions for the child. A Kyesoma belonging to a warrior clan will select for size and speed and endurance, while that of a political clan will select for attractiveness(facial symmetry, clear skin, etc). Any changes she makes at this point will be genetic as we know it. That is, heritable traits that the altered child will be able to pass on to their own children.

  The second part of the Kyesoma toolkit happens during the fetal stage, where she can affect the fetus's development by closely monitoring its growth and nutritional intake and providing everything it needs as it needs it. She can also subtly manipulate what we would call gene expressions, which we know to affect a person's mental/emotional disposition as well as their future physical potential. Kyesoma babies are always born big and healthy.

  (A good example of gene expressions in our world is how, despite the Dutch presently being the tallest people in the world on average, because of a famine during world war 2 every child born from during that famine tended to be extremely short, even if they had perfectly good nutrition after they were born. Another one is that the chance of one having a mental illness is increased exponentially if your mother was put under heavy emotional stress during pregnancy). 

  The last facet of a Kyesoma's ability is expressed during labour, where she can induce labor on herself at will, dilate her uterus, and etc. Basically have an all around easy and complication free birth every time, no major risks.

    There's a lot more to labor than induction and dilation. Is your intent intent that they can act on their own body (dilate, induce) or both their body and the fetal body (fixing breech positions, making sure they don't get twisted around the cord, monitoring nutrient levels, there's a long list of this stuff)?

      Kyesomas only affect their own body, can't magically turn or position the baby or anything like that. But since they have an extrasensory ability to sense their womb and child, they can easily see if the baby is turned around or in a perilous position. And because of that sense their knowledge of pregnancies would be very advanced, better than ours in many ways.

      Edit: to be clear, they can affect the fetus's body in many ways, just not magically move it to prevent a breech birth or cord strangulation.

        That's still a pretty substantial number of dangerous-to-the-mother labors, just making sure you know (floor ~5% for "one or the other dies without intervention").

    So, it sounds like her powers are that, insofar as her own children go, she can give them the benefit of several generations worth of selective breeding... in a *single* generation.

    You say that she gets to choose which parent's traits get passed on. I assume that means that she cannot introduce traits that *neither* parent has; if neither parent has the gene for red hair, she can't bear a red-headed child. But she can easily *eliminate* some heritable gene, and tune some others.

    So if, for example, there is some genetic disease that crops up occasionally, this disease will never crop up in a Kyesoma's child. This instantly suggests a division into the Pure (children of Kyesomas, and children of two Pure parents) and the Impure (everyone else), where only the Impure have any chance of getting genetic diseases (or, at least, genetic diseases that correspond to known codes). Given that a given Kyesoma will probably be having as many children as possible, so as to magnify her influence, it won't take many generations to have a large population of Pure people - especially if the Pure are widely considered the superior beings.

    It also suggests that the genetics of distant tribes may diverge with frantic speed (compared to our world). One tribe may value height and speed, while another favours short, stocky strength - and in a mere generation or two, the members of each tribe will be *visibly* different. *Especially* the Pure members of each tribe. (Which may lead to conflict, as each tribe assumes that the other tribe's Pure are actually Impure...)

      Some interesting ideas. 

      > she cannot introduce traits that neither parent has

      correct. 

      > this disease will never crop up in a Kyesoma's child

      they would have to track down what part of the code(I need a better name for that) corresponds to the disease, but yes, that's true. 

      > genetics of distant tribes may diverge with frantic speed 

      My idea is that the kyesa skill would naturally spread quickly throughout a society, as the main advantage in the initial stages would be just increased fertility and reduction in child/mother mortality(I say just, but it's very significant in a low tech world). In that sense for the ability to provide a relative advantage over a rival nation it would need to be spread far and wide among all the women. And even if they tried to restrict it, the skill has a very low barrier to entry and a basic version can be easily shared and taught.

      It would only be later that the cumulative, generational nature of the skill would show, as it would require a long time to discover what code corresponds to what trait, especially if the more important and desirable traits were partly epigenetic or something akin to a [polygene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygene), like a multipart, non-contigious code. In that case it would be extremely difficult to conclusively select for the more complex traits purely by trial and error. It would require a generational effort of observing correlation and painstakingly establishing causation. 

      At this level I think it's inevitable that social stratification would occur, like you said. Families or nations would hoard the knowledge of which codes correspond to which trait, and would eventually come to exhibit an increasing divergence from the more ignorant masses as generations pass, although hidden pitfalls might occur if they inbreed too much. Maybe [Hybrid Vigour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterosis) would be a thing in this world too, hah.

      One societal consequence that I think would be inevitable given these conditions is that women would become increasingly valuable for their skill as a kyesoma to their own family, and would quickly no longer be "sold off" to their husband to join his family. Which means a natural transition to matrilineal family inheritance, where a male's heir wouldn't be his own children, but his nephew by his sister. 

      And inevitably, some sneaky women are going to try to overturn the patriarchy by breeding daughters to be smarter than their sons or something, so you would have matriarchal dynasties popping up in some places, and as a reaction strict controls over kyesomas to prevent it in others. Interesting stuff, but it wouldn't happen immediately, not until after hundreds of years of experimentation with the skill.

        You might end up with things like polyandry, serial marriages, or a woman having several kids out of wedlock as practice before getting married for real. Each mate would offer more options for designing kids, while monogamy offers a limited amount of raw material to work with.

        Over time, a eugenics based caste system might spring up, as warriors and scholars and artists would benefit from different sets of traits.
        ```

    One trick the comments here seem to be missing is that kyesomas can infer some stuff about alleles without knowing anything about what they code for, and select statistically "better" traits even if you'll have no idea of in what ways. Firstly, they can observe that generally being heterozygous is better than homozygous, and select "anything that isn't identical" for every gene that is possible. This might have effects similar to a "negative amount of inbreeding" or hybrid vigour. 
    Secondly, over multiple pregnancies they can memorize the traits of previous fathers, and  if a later one is inferior to a previous one they can where possible try to match what they had. 


    There's also another trick they can use to figure out *some* stuff about what traits correspond to what, if in a much weaker and more statistical form than experimentation by starting pregnancies with many different men, memorizing the codes that are not their own in each case, terminating the pregnancy before it incurs any costs, and comparing the memorized codes to the observed traits of the man. This can also be combined with the second trick.
