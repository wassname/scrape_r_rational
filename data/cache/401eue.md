## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

        The lottery is actually pretty harmful. It's a tax on low-income households (who invariably form the majority of participants) and gambling addicts. It's very fucked up.

          This sounds a lot like the argument that poor people spend on alcohol etc because they're bad with money - rather than the obvious consideration that it might be making their life better. 

          Is it that unlikely that poorer people use lottery as entertainment because it's cheaper than what richer people do (cinema, hobbies, etc.)

            Spending your savings on entertainment is a problem no matter how inured to the world you want to be. Gambling addiction is not a joke, it ruins people and they literally *can not stop.*

              Right, but the problem there is not that people are spending their savings on entertainment, it's that people are poor enough that their entertainment is cutting into their savings. Do poor people actually spend more on entertainment like lottery than well-off people? I doubt that.

  So I was watching the Supergirl pilot last week.  It was disappointing in a number of ways.

  But specifically, reading some of the rational stuff here and With This Ring has dampened my potential enjoyment more than it would have otherwise.

  Supergirl gets into a fight with a super-strong guy with an ax.  After getting sliced up with it once earlier in the show, during the final fight, she gets the ax away from the guy.  So does she:

  1. Use the ax against him?

  2. Break it immediately?

  3. Fling it away into the ocean, or otherwise remove it from the immediate fight?

  4. Stand around posing for the camera, and then allow the bad guy to pick up the ax and try to chop her with it again?

  The answer is of course (4).

  It is not quite the level of stupid in season one of Flash, where he's fighting the two guys with hot and cold guns.  There, instead of using his super speed against what are two baseline humans with fancy guns, he stops a distance away from them, allows them to keep shooting him with the fire and freezing beams, and *slowly* walks between the bad guys until the hot/cold beams are pointed directly at each other, and then zips away, which allows the guns to shoot each other and get destroyed.

  I could kind of forgive this if Barry hasn't already demonstrated fast cognition (by reading a book in a second or so), if he had at least been spinning around at the time, allowing his hot side to be cooled off by the cold side and vice versa.  But instead he's just going to rely on his regeneration, and try to suffer as much as possible.  It was literally the most painful way to end the fight.

  Or he could have just stayed away and pelted them with rocks or something that doesn't require him to be continuously be frozen/burned.

  I'm now used to Paul/Pavel/Grayven plotting a FTL transfer, zapping the bad guys with a railgun (or something less lethal if appropriate) and getting it done with a minimum of fuss.  Spoiled, I am.

  Edit: grammar.

    For some strange reason people think it's far more badass to "fight" in showy, ineffective ways that maximize the pain and struggle to be endured rather than delivering a quick, final victory.
    ```

    - u/alexanderwales:
      ```
      Readers tend to like long battles that form their own little story arc. A pleasing fight should have some rising action to it, a few twists and turns, and a climax.

      And you can totally have that with two people seeking a quick, final victory! You can get that ebb and flow from characters utterly intent on pulling out all the stops and fighting each other to the death with no regard for anything else.

      The problem comes from inexperienced (or bad, or lazy) writers who want that drama but aren't able to think up a good way to get it. So they have the hero throw away his gun and "settle it honorably", or something stupid like that, which is lame. It's ignoring one half of the balancing act between pragmatism and drama, when if you're good enough, you can have both.

    The Flash is my favorite superhero, and I watch the show, but I find it so painful sometimes. Why is the guy with super-speed getting physically punched by people who only have super-strength? He's demonstrated the ability to move fast enough that he's a blur, why are villains still capable of landing a hit? They've slowed him down a lot on the show as compared to the comics, but he's still fast enough that guns should be useless against him too. In the period between them lifting the gun to aim and having it pointed at him, he should be somewhere else. It's frustrating.

    I've been watching Supergirl, for some reason, and find it about on par with other comic book shows, which is to say lacking in both intelligence and worldbuilding. The Red Cyclone episode pissed me off enough that I haven't seen anything after that, but I'm a glutton for punishment, so maybe I'll at least read some reviews of it.

  Please [evaluate my evaluation](https://np.reddit.com/r/TumblrInAction/comments/3zpqku/holy_crap_the_otherkin_vs_transactivist/cyq1vt6?context=6) of [Anne Lawrence's evaluation](http://www.annelawrence.com/brain-sex_critique.html) of Chung's and Hulshoff Pol's relevance as rebuttals of Zhou's and Kruijver's results regarding the size and cell count of the BSTc as an indicator of transsexualism in particular, and as rebuttals of the entire theory of 'brain sex' (brain gender), that is brain features that strongly indicate gender identity (while not excluding the existence of brain features that strongly indicate genetic sex and sex hormone exposure), in general.

  I previously only read Hulshoff Pol's study regarding gross brain volume as a result of cross-sex hormone exposure and presumed that gross brain volume was the trans-indicative feature being proposed by Zhou/Kruijver, and that Zhou and Kruijver were the only results relevant to the 'brain sex' theory. I made this assumption in good faith of Lawrence's intellectual honesty and credibility as a presumed scientist (though she has an MD in anesthesiology, a PhD in sexology, and an MA in psychology, she does not in fact appear to be very scientific).

  I was hesitant of Lawrence's intellectual honesty and credibility, given her wholehearted acceptance of Blanchard's typology of transsexualism as either 'homosexual' (androphilic) or 'autogynephilic' (gynephilic) and etiology of transsexualism at least in the latter case being conditioning from autogynephilic masturbation. This typology and etiology is unsupported, insulting, and harmful, and it's a bit of a nightmare to hear that Lawrence is (was?) in WPATH and Blanchard is (was?) on the DSM-V committee regarding gender. I was willing to bite the bullet, however, so I stopped my examinations at Hulshoff Pol's results and the fraction of Lawrence's critique that was presented to me and was prepared to accept that 'brain sex' as a whole was debunked.

  I should not have. After a perfunctory visit to *Wikipedia* for biological indicators of transsexualism, I discovered that not only was Hulshoff Pol completely irrelevant to Zhou, Kruijver, and Chung, not only did Zhou and Kruijver control for sexuality *and* cross-sex hormone exposure, contrary to Lawrence's misrepresentation, not only did Chung not raise serious doubts about BSTc size and cell count as an *indicator* (though it still indicates reversed causality, as the BSTc becomes differentiated in adulthood (though BSTc may still be part of the direct etiology of dysphoria itself)), and not only does Chung itself theorize a brain-anatomical explanation for BSTc's delayed differentiation, there are now *four additional studies,* three on brain structure, one on brain response to pheromones, that all support the 'brain sex' theory. In other words, the TERF site that the quote was probably pulled from denouncing 'brain sex' and the presentation of Lawrence's critique in TiA as "debunking" 'brain sex' is outdated at best.

  So, first of all, presenting Lawrence's critique as a "debunking" of 'brain sex' in general without doing further research is intellectually dishonest. If you don't think to check the Wikipedia article for more up-to-date results, you're not even *trying* to reach the truth, you're trolling for the first remotely plausible thing supporting your preconceptions that falls into your lap. Second of all, Lawrence's critique is intellectually dishonest itself. Her "second most plausible explanation" relies on invalidating the reported sexuality of the Zhou/Kruijver subjects by appealing to autogynephilia: the 'homosexual' (androphilic) transsexuals were mistaken in their attraction to men; they were instead attracted to themselves having sex with a man as a culmination of womanhood, and so are instead 'autogynephilic' transsexuals. This is blatantly motivated reasoning, and relies on the unsupported autogynephilic etiology to support the typology.

  Her "most plausible explanation" relies on an even grosser misrepresentation. Her entire debunking relies on exposure to cross-sex hormones explaining the trans-indicative difference in BSTc volume and cell count. To do so, she points to Hulshoff Pol, which reveals that gross brain volume is affected by exposure to cross-sex hormones, and that cell count is a probable affector in brain volume. The problem with this is of course that Hulshoff Pol does not in the slightest look at the size or cell count of the BSTc itself, so it cannot be counted as an overturning of Zhou/Kruijver or a non-replication. Indicators of genetic/gonadal sex do not contravene the indicators of gender identity. In addition, Zhou and Kruijver themselves address exposure to cross-sex hormones! This is only covered as a complete afterthought to the "debunking," with Lawrence minimizing their importance, referencing only two controls and ignoring the other ~six, including among them a trans-indicative transgender with no orchiectomization or cross-sex hormone exposure whatsoever.

  The biggest problem, however, with Lawrence's explanations, is that they rely on Zhou/Kruijver being undermined by Chung and rendered irrelevant by Hulshoff Pol. Hulshoff Pol, however, is irrelevant, Chung does not undermine Zhou/Kruijver as an indicator, and subsequent results continue to point to 'brain sex' as a valid etiology of dysphoria, though neurological intersexedness itself is underexplored and itself has an unknown etiology. Lawrence's explanations are in light of a debunking that was entirely illusory.

    Okay, I read through the studies. I have no particular dog in that fight. Let me break things down so that I can understand them a bit better.

    [**Zhou, 1995**](http://sindromebenjamin.tripod.com/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderfiles/brainsex.pdf)

    > There's a thing in the brain called a (BSTc). It's larger in men than in women. MtF transsexuals have a female sized one. Sexual orientation doesn't make a difference and neither do adult hormones.

    [**Kruijver, 2000**](http://press.endocrine.org/doi/pdf/10.1210/jcem.85.5.6564)

    > I did the same thing as Zhou, but where Zhou did volume of BSTc, I did a count of neurons. I used the same subjects and got the same result, but with the additional finding that FtM transsexuals have a male sized BSTc.

    [**Chung, 2002**](http://scholarworks.gsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1049&context=neurosci_facpub)

    > We took a look at this BSTc thing you were talking about. Men and women *do* have differently sized BSTces, but they're not different until puberty. Transsexuals report that they're the wrong gender before that. So we don't really know why that is, but our best guess is that something causes people to be transgendered before puberty and that thing also causes the BSTc to be different, maybe. But that's not what we were really studying.

    **[Hulshoff Pol, 2006](http://courses.biology.utah.edu/carrier/3320/sexual%20diff.%20papers/Changing%20your%20sex.pdf)**

    > Transsexuals have brain volume according to their born gender. This changes with hormone therapy to the transitioning gender. Maybe this is causing what Zhou and Kruijver were seeing?

    **[Lawrence, 2007](http://www.annelawrence.com/brain-sex_critique.html)**

    > The brain-sex theory is totally busted, thanks Hulshoff Pol. This means that what's really going on is that some transsexuals are that way because they think becoming a woman is the height of their sexual fantasy, and other transsexuals are that way because they think that's the best way to have sex with the opposite gender.

    So ...

    You're right that Lawrence is a fucking moron without an ounce of intellectual honesty and deserving of no credibility (my words, not yours). She's sensed weakness and jumped on the opposition so that she can champion her own pet theory. "You say X and I say Y. Here's some evidence that it's not X. Therefore it's Y." This is a crystal clear false dichotomy and she should be ashamed to have published that paper.

    *But with that said*, I think you're being driven by your personal biases. The Zhou/Kruijver studies do control for cross-sex hormones, but do so in ways that I find extremely suspect and non-conclusive. Namely, their six transsexuals had been on hormone therapy for many years. The studies then compare those transsexuals against subjects who had been exposed to only brief periods of cross-sex hormones, with some being as short as a month. The BSTc volume/count might change over *years* of hormone therapy but not over *months*. This is a hypothesis they did not test, nor control for, nor mention. They also did not test non-transitioned transsexuals, which is another significant weakness of the two studies. Further, while their controls were exposed to cross-sex hormones, they weren't exposed at the same dosages, in the same ways, etc. It's apples to oranges in far too many ways.

    Hulshoff Pol *is* a serious blow to Zhou/Kruijver, because it kicks one of their legs out from beneath them, mainly their contention that hormone therapy couldn't possibly be the reason for the difference in BSTc volume/count. In fact, I would say that it becomes likely that hormones are responsible for what Zhou/Kruijver saw. The only saving grace might be that the interval period for the Hulshoff Pol transsexuals was four months, which is less time than for two thirds of their controls. But since it's another apples and oranges comparison (this time, total brain volume to BSTc volume/count) that might not be enough.

    That leaves you with the subsequent results you mentioned, which I haven't read. But if you want my opinion, Lawrence is a crank trying to advance her own Freudian agenda and Hulshoff Pol does cast significant doubt on Zhou/Kruijver (though I wouldn't call that a debunking of brain-sex theory, nor would I say that the hormone explanation for their results is necessarily correct, not without further study, this time hopefully with more and better data).
    ```

    - u/Transfuturist:
      ```
      > They also did not test non-transitioned transsexuals

      There was one non-transitioned person with "strong cross-gender feelings," and they placed in the trans-indicative range (though there are two male outliers in the same area).

      >subjects who had been exposed to only brief periods of cross-sex hormones, with some being as short as a month

      S1 had an adrogenic tumor for "more than 1 year," S2 had an estrogenic (totally real words) tumor for "at least 1 year," S5 was orchiectomized and had "antiandrogen treatment" (?) for the last two years. FMT stopped taking testosterone three years before death. S2 as well, but FMT and S5 in particular placed strongly in the male range, S5 attaining abnormally outlier levels, and S1 also placed strongly in the female range.

      It is the weakest part of the studies, to my frustration. A lot of subsequent studies used transsexuals with no exposure to cross-sex hormones, however. Luders had 24 untreated MTF samples for the right putamen result, Rametti had ?? untreated FTM samples for the fractional anisotropy result, and Berglund had ?? untreated MTF samples for the pheromone response result.

      One problem I don't like is that Zhou/Kruijver use the same samples. Gender-linked INAH3 was found in [**Garcia-Falgueras**](http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/content/131/12/3132), though LeVay also reported a sexuality-linked INAH3 in men. They used the same samples, with four additional MTF samples, however. They possibly used different control samples as well, and may have gotten more S samples, I didn't check.

      An interesting result I'm finding in Garcia-Falgueras is that they measured total brain weight, which I imagine corresponds to gross brain volume, and that total brain weight does not correlate with the volume of the uncinate nucleus nor the subnuclei they were measuring. This was probably done in response to Hulshoff Pol's results, as it was published in 2008, two years later (they even categorize by Blanchard's typology and find no result, this may have even been done in response to Lawrence and friends). So there is at least reason to believe that the BSTc and INAH3 would not relate to gross brain volume. I will update my skepticism accordingly, however. The dearth of control T samples is a major problem with these results.

      Replication with more experimental and control samples would be ever-so-lovely. I hope MRI develops enough to be able to distinguish the BSTc and INAH3, and possibly to count cells, because a major hindrance to these results is that they have to be obtained post-mortem. Otherwise I would gladly volunteer. :P

      Thanks for the in-depth response!

  If I can write roughly 6,000 words per week that I'd be more or less happy with putting online, would it be better as:

  1. 6,000 words once per week
  2. 3,000 words twice a week
  3. 1,000 words six times a week
  4. 24,000 words once per month
  5. Just finish the thing and publish it when it's done

    I generally prefer faster updates, but find updates more satisfying when they either create a new point of speculation, or resolve a prior one.

    ```

  - u/Sparkwitch:
    ```
    I think it's important that the update length match the sort of story you want to tell.

    Regardless of how many words they have, each update should feel satisfying and complete. Not that it oughtn't end in a cliffhanger, but it the scene it narrates, and the arcs it traces, ought to be self-contained.

    Short updates work best for intensely episodic material: A lot of characters in short vignettes, a relatively loose timeline, and no space for extensive exposition. A story with many short updates will tend to feel faster and less coherent.

    Longer updates allow more time to get comfortable with individual scenes before the narrative jerks violently towards a different one. There's more room to relax, reflect, and discuss. The larger the update, the truer that is... to the point that a finished thing, published when it's done can proceed at whatever pace it needs to.

    That said, frequent updates are a *lot* more likely to build reader loyalty than infrequent ones. Checking for new story pieces twice a week builds a stronger habit than trying to remember once a month. Waiting for a whole book to publish drives steadfast fans crazy, and makes the rest of the readership ignore you entirely.

    **How important is reader loyalty to you?**

    **What pace of story do you want to tell?**

  I finished reading Frankenstein's Monster today. It's a good book, and deserve its status as a classic, but it maybe hasn't aged well. Leaving aside all the stuff in the side bar, it takes place in a world where people who experience something traumatizing can fall sick with fever and delirium for several months. More than once. Also, spoilers for the rest of the comment, I find it difficult to sympathize with Frankenstein. He spends months putting together a body (without using corpse parts) hoping to create life, then when it awakens he is so terrified of it that he locks himself in his room for a week hoping it will go away. Which it does. 

  Then months later when it confronts him and begs him to recognize it as a thinking, feeling being who wants to be good and doesn't want to live alone and shunned in the wilderness, he calls it a thing of evil that shouldn't exist. So... it kills his friends and family and taunts him until he goes mad. After hearing several times over the years that the monster isn't evil, I wasn't expecting it to go all Monte Cristo on him.

    Yeah, the monster was evil, but Frankenstein was an asshole. The monster gets a Freudian excuse.

    (The monster's response kind of justifies Frankenstein's fear...)

    >it takes place in a world where people who experience something traumatizing can fall sick with fever and delirium for several months. More than once.

    Lethargy, major depression, and agoraphobia notwithstanding, there are such things as delirium, dissociation, depersonalization, derealization, psychotic breaks. A lot of these can result from severe and/or prolonged trauma and stress, and they *can* last for months.
    ```

  - u/Kishoto:
    ```
    In Frankenstein, the obvious theme is you shouldn't dig up corpses and string them together to create life because *no*. (Which I don't really agree with.) But the deeper theme is that Frankenstein didn't create a monster out of corpse parts. He created one out of mistreatment and neglect. I think the author meant to show that Frankenstein's real mistake was in being unable to accept his creation and treat it decently. This extends to real life in that, while people aren't creating literal monsters out of dead bodies, they ARE creating monstrous human beings due to the way they treat them. 

    I wouldn't call the monster good. But I would say that it's turn to evil was understandable, in the same way that I'd say a serial killer who became that way due to years of abuse is understandable. Acceptable? No. And it's probably too little too late at this point, so put them down. But it's less their fault and more their environments. You're a product of it, after all.

    And why programing? Just bored with your degree work?  What is to make a hiring manager think you won't get bored again. 

    Try interviewing for interesting jobs, if they fail you because of a lack of degree then I'd recommend school. My advice is just skip the middle part and go straight onto interesting game work. Or even a boring programming job, to use aa a resume stepping stone.

      I considered that, and I have no aversion to being a code monkey for a few years if I thought that would let me move into an excellent software/data scientist position. But it also seems to me that as a hiring manager, while skills are important (so for example, if I build up my portfolio full of data analytics and apply for a data scientist position), any good company will still pick someone with the degree + internship/work experience + portfolio compared to basic coding experience + portfolio. Having decent coding skills + enthusiasm/portfolio doesn't seem like it would stack up against a formally educated person going for the same position. Is that incorrect?

        That depends. Plenty of companies would prefer a guy with a formal engineering degree than a random code monkey. (I was in a civil engineering shop that had a bunch of PEs and CS collaborating on civil engineering code). And honestly a good hiring manager will discount degrees compared to intelligence. 

        However, I will admit that an HR department will do exactly what you say. So focus your search on smaller companies that don't have an HR dept screening them. Or even talk to a recruiter/headhunter. They get a bad rap, but they get paid (by the company) for getting you hired. 

        Going to school isn't necessarily wrong, but the opportunity cost (lost wages + fees) seems steep, as compared to the cost of just looking a bit longer for a job.

          I'm aware and I worry about that as well- I've been saving heavily for the two years I've been in industry to prepare for that, but again it seems like a short-term cost compared to long-term gain (due to a higher peak), plus it would be a more likely to succeed / direct path. 

          I also may have a skewed vision of this because many of my friends are going to medical/veterinary schools and are hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt now.

          Edit: I don't want to convey that I'm ignoring your advice- I'll definitely look into smaller companies that are just looking for coders, I think that'd be a  great place to begin. I had thoughts of using that opportunity to move to a state with good computer science programs, gain state residency, and trying to do volunteer research to help with the application. If in that time I find that there's a better path / I enjoy what I'm doing, I'll reconsider.

            I did this, well I'm finishing my thesis now, but it took 3 years of full time skill due to lack of programming pre-requisits. (BS Ienglish MS Comp-Sci this spring assuming sucessful defence) 

            You should be getting mid level engineeing pay, and it's going to be hard to even get hired as a mid level programmer, so question 1 is do you want to do it for a pay neutral to negative switch that cost three years.  It'll probably only be pay neutral if you can get picked up at a higher level that your professional programming experience, rates, but that can be done (it helps to intern there and make them forget your an intern and not a full time programmer)  That said I like it.

  ```
  What software do writers use? I'm considering starting a (non-rational, though I'm sure it'll be impacted somewhat by my strong appreciation for such fiction) Undertale/Avatar:TLA crossover fic soon. Haven't written fiction for like, 8 years, but I'll figure it out if I try it, I'm sure.

    Oh lord...

    I'm all for it, but man, it just doesn't feel right.
