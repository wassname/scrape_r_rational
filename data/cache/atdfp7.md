  This is huge, Cat has not only strengthened the morale of the third army, but given them a name, and names add narrative weight to them.
  This army isn't going down any time soon.

      They lasted for quite a long time if you recall. They only got burned because they were fighting a literal demigod.

      Also the Gallowborne story was that cat bought* their lives so that they had to live and die for her sake. It's different from an army forged in crucibles hitherto unseen.

      Man, that was a long time ago. Remind me: were there any survivors in the Gallowborne? If so, what happened to them?
      ```

      - u/BlackKnightG93M:
        ```
        Nah, they got teamwiped.
        ```

        - u/cyberdsaiyan:
          ```
          There *were* a few survivors, but I assume they got assimilated into the other armies.
          ```

      - u/tavitavarus:
        ```
        We know that at least one survived to write the memoirs in previous chapter quotes, but I doubt more than a handful survived.
        ```

      - u/Zayits:
        ```
        A wipe, and then Cat conscripted all Akua's remaining household troops and forgot about them for a book.
        ```
