  The [closest thing](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/a-hedge-maze-is-you.19308/) that I can recall reading that fits your description. It's a quest about a newly sentient hedge maze in a fantasy setting. I didn't finish it, but the starting was interesting.

    Aww, it's incomplete...was kind of fun though.

  I saw one where he was inside a mimic, inside a dungeon, all he could do was eat what was in front of him... don't recall a bush
