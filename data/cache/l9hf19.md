## How To Advertise Rational Fiction

  This is a weird question.

  If you think that this sub is a really valuable community then you should engage with the community here. If you're not sure what engagement with the community looks like there are policies around self-promotion which could provide guidance.

  We have a weekly recommendations thread and you could post a comment there promoting whatever and writing a pitch for it.

  Most of the people who read this sub don't know much about digital advertising, but given what I know about acquisition costs, I'm skeptical that you'd hit positive ROI via ads. It would only work if ads were able to kick off an organic flywheel and if your book is good enough for that you shouldn't need ads to sell it here.

  if you're already here,  and engaged with reddit you're probably better off just investing time. Several authors self-promote on r/Fantasy really effectively, so I'd take a look at what they're doing.

  EDITS: The comment I was replying to was deleted as I was posting this, so I'm adding it here since I bothered to type it all out. 

  >Does that make my question less weird?   

  Asking people "What would be the best way to advertise to you?" is weird. You're basically saying, "Who should I pay to tell you about the thing I want  you to head about?" and that's just a really weird way to approach someone. It's also weird because people talk about books they're writing in this subreddit, or in the comments of Scott Alexander's blog or in related spaces all the time. People who are part of one of these (somewhat overlapping) communities are mostly aware of the community norms around self-promotion. Your question on how "to advertise to you" makes it feel like you're not really engaged with this community, and aren't interested in being so. Wanting to pay some third party to promote your message in our community is whatever, but coming and asking us for advice on how to do that is bizarre. Most communities don't like foreign interference, and you've positioned yourself as an outsider that's looking to pay someone to shift to the discourse of this community, and then you've asked the community to help you brainstorm how to do this. I feel like this wasn't your intent, but your language is very commercially focused  (advertise, bootstrapped) and you don't put any effort into making the people you're asking for help like you. The result feels so brazenly exploitative it crosses over into "weird."

  Probably you want to ask a less-commercially worded question like, "How can I best promote my rational-adjacent novel?"If you want really good answers from focus group research though, you have to ask people about their problems rather than your problems.  The people here, in general, don't know how to promote novels. Most of them aren't authors, and most of the ones that are authors don't do digital advertising. They do read a lot though, and they can share with you their experience of how they discover what to read next. "How do you find the next book to read?" is a question that might tell you a bunch about ways to promote your book.

  >I'm impressed that you can make this calculation without knowing what I'm publishing, my back catalogue, or how I'm advertising. I wouldn't have any idea how to even ballpark ROI without this information. I'd greatly appreciate it if you were able to walk me through how you approached this calculation and what assumptions you made? 

  Eh. This is literally my job. I measure digital ad ROI for a living. Paid acquisition costs in Western markets are typically $3-$15 across a really wide range of products. Free gaming apps, personalized health products, custom t-shirts. Prices for ebooks are typically in the $0-$10 range. Maybe you can make it work, but I think my skepticism is warranted.

      not necessarily. Rational community is very diverse, and the people who create fiction are strange outliers, especially those who create original fiction.

  Inasmuch as there exists a community of readers of rational fiction, it's here + word of mouth. So... just post your work when you release it? There's nothing in the rules outlawing just making a post saying "Hi, there's this work I made, here's why I think it'll be of interest, hope you enjoy". The author of Hey Reincarnation Goddess did that just this week, to literally nobody's complaints.

    What he said. Just make a post here about it. There's no rule against self-promotion and  finding new stories is one of the reasons people read this subreddit.

  Is it a web-release or hard-copy?

  RoyalRoad seems to be a strong player in the web-release fiction game, and they have user sponsored advertisements. I'm not sure how granular their advertisement choices are, as I've never used it, but they host RatFic like [Mother of Learning] and [Worth the Candle]. If you expect any cross-readership from existing RatFic then you should probably find a way, RoyalRoad or other, to advertise to those established audiences.

  Publishing stuff like LitRPG (which can kinda be RatFic sometimes) on Amazon seems to be pretty big too.

  And if you're running a consistent update schedule, then it's free to post those new chapters to reddit and generate discussion. I can guarantee that the discussions here carry over into other forums. Word of mouth advertisement is a real thing.

  Despite its name, Comic Ad (comicad dot net) accepts non-comic ads, works on a pretty low cost bidding system and is a great way to dip your toes into advertising / test out various ad setups. Social media would be my next pitch, though I've not had much luck with it personally (I am bad at social media); at this point in modern history I'd honestly leave conventional paid ads (Facebook ads, etc) as a last resort, they tend to be priced more toward companies than individuals these days.

  People might be reacting negatively because that’s what you’re throwing out in your edit, but also some people are out off by any mention of advertising in a Reddit community.  “I had hope for a higher level of discourse from this community” comes off as a bit
   r/iamverysmart and the idea that authors are writing books based on how Reddit subs treat them seems a bit absurd.  Trying to shame a sub of people that at least partially tried to give you good advice seems like a bit of a sick move.

  Anyway as others have said you really have to start by engaging various communities in a positive manner.  Plenty of people on here mention books or worlds they’re working on while they write.  Rational, worldbuilding, fantasy, and maybe progressionFantasy would all be great subs to post in.  There are also lots of discords you could join that are plugging new rational fiction.  You could look into working with someone else on a side project as well.  Pay someone somewhat known to draw some art for your story, or engage with a voice actor like Voraces or some up and coming narrator to do an audiobook version so they can spread it around.  Give out free copies of you weren’t already.

  You probably are aware of most of the places you can find rational stories if you are a reader. If someone else is a fan of rational stories, they are most likely keeping an eye on those same places, like we all are. And since most of those websites have internal raking systems like reviews and likes, there is not much to do besides publishing on those and having a consistent update schedule. The rest just depends on how well written your story is and how much pull your concept has.

  I don't think there are many ways to specifically target us. Like most niche hobby communities starved for content, mouth-to-mouth market ends up doing all the heavy lifting. We tend to find you, not the other way around.

  Well, you could probably start by mentioning the name and premise of your work in your post asking about how to advertise it.
