  I'm not sure it fits the definition (I agree about The Destiny being a convenient plot device too often), but it certainly has some rational elements that are done very well. I'd say better than anything than I've read.

  The characters and politics is done very well, even better than in HPMoR I'd say. Characters aren't as rational in general, but they act accordingly to their intelligence, consistently, and have sensible (if wrong) beliefs and use what they can to get their way. Their emotions are portrayed very realistically and the connection between emotions, rationality, and actions are where I think a lot of rational fiction fails flat.

  I don't know if Geralt's relationship with Yennefer is "mature", but it certainly is both interesting and believable. And yeah, female characters in Witcher world rulez. There's a big cast of interesting women, so they can have flaws and quirks, and be different from each other. They don't feel like the typical token female protagonist, in fact they feel like just another character. And still the world in which they have to live is sexist and it makes sense.

  Politics is dirty, and is done by almost everyone, at various levels. Some of the agents are competent and some very incompetent, and still the results doesn't only depend on the rationality of the given side (but it increases the probability the plan will work). The dirty political tricks used in the story are very realistic (minority scapegoating, exploiting rebellions of opressed, economical warfare, using prejudice and stereotypes), and feel very modern (muslim refuges in EU / Isis -> nonhumans in Northern Kingdoms / Scoiatael), despite being written in 80s-90s.

  In general Sapkowski portrays the probabilistic nature of the universe very well. There is no "conservation of importance", and no "100% rules". Grand strategy of a brilliant general can fail because one scout was too afraid to check for enemy presence and lied in his report. Whole country can fall because a messenger with important information died in unrelated incident. Character that is amazing at swordplay can be killed by a peasant with a fork if he gets too cocky and fights in a crowd. 

  It's like Sauron wins because Frodo died of food poisoning while in Mordor.

  I think many rational fiction too often end up as competence porn, where the character always wins using science and superiority in one aspect or another. It stretches the pretense of rationality, and Sapkowski avoids that, he goes out of his way to present the general rule and an occasional exception.

  Also I think the rational core in the worldbuilding is not only the existence of Witchers, the whole universe is build a little like sci-fi story, with a few assumptions (magic exists, many worlds exist and sometimes temporarily join). The world builds on that, and is quite consistent (for the mess of mythologies glued together that it is :) ).

  As much as I love the Witcher series, I'd have to say no. 

  The core plot of the 1t arc revolves around at least 2 instances of incredible improbability (Geralt stumbling upon Ciri in Brokilon and then stumbling upon her in the aftermath of the slaughter of Cintra). Which should be of no surprise, since Fate/Destiny is the motif of the *entire* series. If I were to name a more rational and even rationalist take on a similar theme I'd say "Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn" is a must read. 

  You do have a point that there are no Big Evil characters, only a bunch of selfish psychopaths with too much power.

  There are gods, one of them even interacts directly with then-atheist Yennefer.

  The worldbuilding started quite inconsistent with Yennefer and other mages being able of more or less traditional fairy tale magics, i.e. turning people into frogs. There was an apparent rework and systematization effort once Ciri's apprenticeship arc starts, so you'd have a point, but only if you discard first two books.

  Not much to comment on the writing style, it *is* good, but style is irrelevant for RT/RST. It just makes the read pleasant.

  In no way Geralt is a rationalist. He doesn't use any semblance of the scientific method (because there is none invented) and relies on chance again and again i.e. the conclusion of Toussaint arc, again is *pure* luck, or fate if you will. The most rational character is probably Vysogota (a scientist, duh) and perhaps Dijkstra.

  There was a rational core to the world building, where Sapkowski does subvert a very common trope of a simpleton defeating a monster. Instead he says that if there are widespread monsters, killing them would be totally commercialized (and this is the rational seed). The trope is mocked directly in the story about the golden dragon (forgot the name though, the one that poisoned the 1st dragon)

  Yes, the theme of mythologization of the actual events is explored in detail, but that doesn't mean the actual events deserve RT tag. It is used masterfully as a way to have an outside PoV to recap global events without focusing on the boring stuff.

      Well, the terms rational and rationalist fiction are defined in the sidebar of the sub, and I think there isn't much ambiguity there. So yes, this is science porn in a way. Internal consistency porn would be probably a better term.

      The story being rational does not guarantee its quality. But it's not as easy as you think, otherwise rational fiction wouldn't be so scarce. It's definitely not easy writing a *good story* that is rational at the same time.

      I'm not frustrated with inconsistent power levels, I'm just noting that it makes it harder to call the novel rational as defined in this subreddit. The biggest issue though is that *a lot* happens solely because 'the plot requires it' and for no other reason. 

      > You severely underestimate the probability of incredible imporbability.

      My survivorship bias sense is tingling. If I were to make a guess, your grandparents and perhaps the colleague were not Asian, and your grangran was crying in a crowded place (a trasportation hub perhaps?). This alone would bump the probability of the event considerably. Yes, finding a person in a populated area is easier than in the wilderness, because you can *ask*, provided your target doesn't hide intentionally. 

      By the way, my parents met by pure chance too, so what? Had they not, they'd find someone else, which is okay because neither of us are prophesied heir of the elven bloodline yadda yadda. Our conversation, while being improbable is also unimportant. Ciri was inherently important in the story.

      Another crucial piece you're missing here is the notorious repetition of the improbable events in the Witcher. Yes, Geralt finds Ciri *once*, which is improbable, but acceptable. What is less acceptable (in rational fiction, not in fiction in general, mind you) is that he finds her *again* and then *again* by pure chance. That is another key difference between your story and Geralt's. 

      Heck the writing is on the wall, the book is called Sword of Destiny, there is no other way around it.

      > That is a slightly outdated approach. At least, since Levy Strauss's la Pensee sauvage.

      I was using that rather broadly. To put it another way, Geralt isn't really good at rationalist techniques or having *any* system whatsoever. As I recall, there is actually a direct opposition between his approach and that of Yennefer and the Lodge, who try to solve their problem methodically. And fail, by the way. If memory serves, Geralt is even called out at some point for basically having a death wish (by Regis, I think?) instead of actually having a working plan, *any plan,* to find Ciri.

      Yennefer got a jewel for her comm device after a divine revelation.

      tl;dr. Great fantasy series, but not fully rational, definitely not rationalist, therefore not mentioned here.

      Also, yes, HPMOR is the gateway drug to fanfics.

    Not sure what I think about witcher overall (it's been too long and my memories of the books are hazy), but fate being involved doesn't automatically disqualify it. Sure it does provide some leeway for the otherwise improbable events, but it's not like they happen solely "because plot requires them". Things are happening because destiny is influencing events, with effects observable to and exploited by the people inside the fictional universe.

      However, fate, like the Simurgh, is an explanation with nearly infinite explanatory power, which means that fate, like the Simurgh, is an explanation best used infrequently.

        Yup. I fully agree. I really dislike these types of all-powerful plot devices myself. Just thought I'd point out that in this case it's at least a bit forgivable, since it's not invisible or completely unpredictable to the people affected by it.

          Yup. Also, Simurgh is working against the protagonist so it also makes it more acceptable. Another example: the Cthaeh.

    It's playing with old Polish fable about the Dratewka cobbler, almost all of his short stories are "what could be the real history behind fables in fantasy world". Also I don't think amateur having a good (and rational) solution once in a while makes the story irrational. It actually makes it more believable. Among all of the books Geralt killed dozens of monsters, and the amateurs have solved a problem once? That's Sapkowski's trademark - showing the general rules and exceptions. I think it's more believable than rules that work 100% of the time.

    I don't think that's inconsistent. Yennifer is an archmage with tens/hundreds of years of experience; Ciri is a novice. It makes sense that Ciri is only capable of more restricted, more structured forms of expression, whereas Yennifer can do whatever she well pleases.
    ```

    - u/Xtraordinaire:

      It's inconsistent because later in the series she and other archmages have lost these powers, not because there is a skill disparity between an apprentice and a good mage.
