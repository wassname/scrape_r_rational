## When should a RatFic be added to TVTropes?

### Post:

I've been enjoying [The Metropolitan Man](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10360716/1/The-Metropolitan-Man), [The Two Year Emperor](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9669819/1/The-Two-Year-Emperor), and other recommendations from this subreddit.

Does anyone here know enough about how TVTropes works to describe when an ongoing piece of fiction is notable enough to be mentioned in the [RatFic](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RationalFic) page, or even be given a page of its own?


(Alright, alright, I'll admit it - I'm trying to promote the term 'RatFic' over 'Rational Fiction' at least in part due to my chosen totem animal. :) But other than that, I'm still curious about the actual question.)

### Comments:

- u/None:
  ```
  When people other than the author like it enough to write it up on TVTropes themselves.

  I almost downvoted you just for the term "RatFic".

  Anyway, start by linking it here, and if the sub judges it explicitly "Rational" instead of merely "Logical" or "Realistic" then it should go there.

  *TVtropes, there is no such thing as notoriety.*

  If you enjoy the work it is well within your rights to create a fanfic recommendation/page to which you can add the tropes you see. Others see it and review the works and make additions as they see it/refine the tropes already present. I was thinking about starting up a page for these works as well, for I keep popping over to see if they have been made.

  In fact, I am going to go right over and do so now. Shut up and just do it, as the saying goes.

  Edit: Just to update you guys. I am going to create the pages under the YKTTW tab to help make sure that I get the format down for the site as this will be the first time making a trope page and I want it to not crash the site or have bad formatting with naked links everywhere. This should also allow others to help live with creating the page. [Link Here!](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/discussion.php?id=lk93fry4nso8o87lzn705bdj)
