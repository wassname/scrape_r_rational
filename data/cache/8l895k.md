  The characters in A song of ice and fire all act according to flawed human interests. one of the strengths of the book is that every characters is a flawed protagonist of their own story. 

  That doesn't mean ASOIAF is actually irrational. Rational fiction allows characters to act according to emotion, it doesn't require everyone to go full Spock.

    To add to this: I suspect what bugs you (/u/M_D_Adil_Khan) about the examples you give isn't that the characters do dumb things, but that the story doesn't give you enough of a reason to believe that real people could have made those mistakes. 

    One of the biggest strengths of HPMOR and, I think, one of the reason this genre came into existence is its ability to have the reader cheering for Harry as he is solving some problem only to be explained in excruciating detail afterwards why that particular solution was a dumb-ass thing to do.

  It bothers me, not that they make flawed choices, but they seem spectacularly unaware of the potential downsides in their choices.  The characters tend to take very little action that might mitigate the side effects.

  It is like all the idealism that can be used to create interesting characters, but little to none of the self preservation instinct that keeps such people alive in the real world.

  GoT still manages to make interesting characters.  It is just tough to maintain suspension of disbelief on some of their more boneheaded decisions.
