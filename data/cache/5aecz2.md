  So Ray is both the spy AND the one who started the escape. It sounds like he was trying to play both sides. If the escape was looking good, he could do that. If it looked like it was going to fail, he would just fully betray them and stay with Mama.

    Ray even *looks* a bit like Snape

  I feel so stupid right now. I suspected Ray of being the spy, but only as a new one. Of course Mama wouldn't have accepted a new informant so easily!

  As a shounen manga, I'm going to say the reason Ray is working for Mama is because Ray originally was "selfish" enough to only care about his survival.
