I've done an [audio narration](https://soundcloud.com/rattle-fiction-pod/episode-7-the-key-to-every-door) of [The Key for Every Door](https://archiveofourown.org/works/20761817) by /u/CeruleanTresses which was the recent Secret Krampus story winner.

(I've changed the name of the podcast to "Rattle Fiction" and will be posting narrations on a regular (at least monthly) basis. I'm still waiting for Apple Podcasts to approve my [RSS feed](http://feeds.soundcloud.com/users/soundcloud:users:336066354/sounds.rss) and just now submitted to Stitcher, Google Play, and Podbean, so more access is coming soon.)

  Thanks for this :)

  FYI: Looks like you forgot to update this second portion of the link in the OP. In the source it's like this: `[new_link](old_link)`. For people on mobile here's a corrected link [https://soundcloud.com/rattle-fiction-pod/episode-7-the-key-to-every-door](https://soundcloud.com/rattle-fiction-pod/episode-7-the-key-to-every-door)
