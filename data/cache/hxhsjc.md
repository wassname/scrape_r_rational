  SenescentSoul is going on vacation soon, so there's a chapter posted a day early at 1 am on Saturday. Normal time as usual next week.

  Okay that was cool, but now I just have to wait a week.

  We really need a Patreon chapter discussion thread.
  ```

    ```
    If you signed up for Patreon, there should be an email with a Discord link. There's a lot of theorizing about how the System and world works, and a lot of the conversations remind me of this subreddit. Plus a few trolls.

  This chapter is what finally broke me: I binged the patreon content. Good stuff!!
