## [RT] [WIP] [Spoilers] Worth The Candle Plot Holes, Inconsistencies, Questions and Criticism

### Post:




I found my inquiries going under in the active thread and this seemed an appropriate way to talk about the story as whole, so here it goes.
I'm up to chapter 71 but don't hold back on spoilers.

1.) Why did no one even -consider- the option of using unicorn blood on Fenn when she got sliced in half in chapter 51? Instead Joon immediately thinks blood transfusion, but as a reader that seemed incredibly forced and out of left field when a much easier solution was available. I was told it had bad shelf-life but the only textual evidence I could find on that is below, taken from chapter 45:
“I was hoping to find a buyer for unicorn meat,” said Fenn. “We spent a fair bit of time butchering that thing. I’ll hold back a bottle of blood for us, but we’ve got a few from when we drained the thing, and they don’t go bad fast enough to be worthless.” She looked to Solace. “We killed a unicorn, it was no big deal.”
No clear inference how quickly it goes bad. No reason given why freezers don't work for the blood. That unicorn blood would not have helped Fenn is fair enough, but again - no one even brings it up!

2.)Chapter 59, Solace's death. Same thing here, but I'm actually more confused by how the entire team handled Solace's death. A few lines paying lip service to her demise and next chapter we're back at quips and quirky references. Is this part of the narrative constraints imposed by the dungeon master? "Death must not be a serious topic?"

Overall I really like it though to be honest more in a quick-to-digest McDonald's kind of way that borders on addiction. I wonder how much of that is psychologicsl exploitation on part of the author(dungeon master?) - there's always another delicate bit of subversion around the corner, a juicy piece of world-building, an intriguing mystery rearing its head. It reminds me of HPMOR and after the fact I can't honestly say I like-liked that one. It captivated me sure but it had the same... trappings of rational fiction that trip me up in WOC. Yes there's some depth to it, but for every genuine character moment, clever subversion, interesting piece of world-building there's juvenile power fantasies, pseudo-rational ramblings lacking all literary merit and god-awful descriptions(sometimes!). Right now I hold this series in much higher regard than HPMOR but it's lacking just the same.

Thoughts? Answers? Not trying to troll by coming to THE subreddit that's all about this genre and telling you it's shit - I just want some decent (opposing) views on the points I make. And answers, goddamnit!

  But ... why would unicorn blood help? It's established to cure physical diseases and reverse most bodily damage. The thing that's wrong with Fenn at that moment isn't one of those two things, it's blood loss. Unicorn blood hasn't been previously established to create more blood in the body.

  I think perhaps there'd be some merit to Juniper saying something like this when facing the problem ... but mostly for this exact reason, which isn't terribly compelling to me.

  And yes, there was a scene that featured a rant about how games abstract out materials and components as being atomic and without decay, but when I was writing it, it didn't really feel like it had a place to fit, so it became Word of God instead, eventually being canonized in (IIRC) ch 101.

  1) How would Unicorn blood even help? It cures any disease if you drink it, it does not refill your blood, I don't think that was ever implied. Fenn needed a transfusion.

  2) Same thing, Unicorn blood doesn't cure being dead. And your other point - I don't remember the mood exactly, but there was stuff going on everyone had to concentrate on, there wasn't really time for mourning at all. It goes from her dieing to them fighting the prison to them "fighting" (Fallather? I don't remember the name, damn it) a soul-mage. There is never any time off to grieve.

  Oh and for the record, I don't agree with "juvenile power fantasies, pseudo-rational ramblings lacking all literary merit and god-awful descriptions" at all. Not even sometimes.

  Is this the thread were we can point out inconsistencies in WtC? I found one but never pointed it out since I wasn't reading when it came out. In chapter 21:

  >“Ya know,” said Fenn. “Elves can hold their breath for an hour. Guess I didn’t get my dad’s lungs. Also, let’s never travel by glove again.”

  But in chapter 62 Fenn gives Fallatehr, an elf, a breathing mask:

  > “Fenn, you remember riding the rocket?” I asked as I stepped up beside her.

  >“I remember it not going so great,” she said. “Actually, I remember it getting so fucked that you were racing across the desert and burning through your bones, which is what got us in this particular mess in the first place. Besides that, we don’t have a rocket.”

  >“You’ve got the sand bow,” I said. I glanced at the wall, which stood thirty feet high and at least a football field’s length away from us. The shot would be simplicity itself for someone as skilled as Fenn.

  >“You’re nuts,” she said, but she gave me a grin. Her eyes quickly scanned the top of the wall, and I looked with her, to the places where she’d removed the gargoyles. We already knew, from the birds that Solace had sent over, that the laser gargoyles had been the primary means of keeping things from going over the wall. “Not enough masks though, and however great Mary is, I doubt that she can keep it up for long enough that we can make more.” We had made more of them during our week off in the bottle, so that we had five on hand, enough to cover the whole party, but assuming that we still needed to keep up our end of the bargain, that wasn’t enough.

  >I moved back over to Fallatehr. “We have to leave them behind,” I said, gesturing at the pelehr. “Non-negotiable.”

  >“Convenient for you,” said Fallatehr, watching me closely. I agreed with him, it was very convenient for me, but that didn’t make it any less true. Bad enough that we’d be taking him and three others, nearly even numbers except that the nonanima didn’t count, but not releasing more of Fallatehr onto the world was a plus in my book, given what he could do. “Very well.”

  >“Wait ten minutes before you try to get out, we’ll pull you if it’s clear,” I said. I wondered whether he would think it was a trap, because that’s what I would have thought, but I was apparently bad enough at lying that it was an asset to me, because he nodded along.

  >Fenn surprised me by stepping forward and handing him a breathing kit from her glove. I hadn’t even heard her sneak up next to me. He took it for a moment with a mild questioning look, but he put it on all the same.

  It is possible Fallatehr saw this as an opportunity to dispose surplus minions without it being obvious that this is what he was doing. But there is no way Fenn would forget that elves can hold their breath for an hour, they spent her childhood rubbing in how superior they are.

  Though it's not a big deal regardless, the number of masks can be reduced by 1 and any elf minion that needs to die can be replaced with a non-elf minion.

    ... okay, will fix. (I would rather that these just get PMed to /u/inked_cellist, who will either fix them or pass them on to me if they're not easily fixed.)

    WtC is 800K words long, with a whole bunch of stuff in it, and while I *usually* catch minor continuity errors, it's being written pretty fast, and there's a ton of detail that doesn't always make it into my notes for later reference. So, I apologize for the occasional inconsistency, and will try to fix them if pointed out, but I have no editor.

      Thank you, I know it's a quibble but I didn't know where to go with it. I posted it here since it seemed like the most relevant place. WtC is on the Pareto frontier with regard to consistency, complexity and the speed at which it is being written.

  Why not just... not read it if you don't like it? The author is providing this story --which many of us like a great deal -- for free. Literally no one is forcing you to read something that you don't enjoy, and criticism of this type, no matter how earnest and well intended you might mean it as (and it's by no means clear that it actually is well intended), is far more effective at discouraging writers from sharing their work here than it is at helping improve anything.
