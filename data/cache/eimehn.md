## [RT][WIP] The Elemental Arena - Chapter 15

### Post:

A [new chapter](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/27800/the-elemental-arena/chapter/440582/chapter-fifteen-spoils-of-war) is up!

The Elemental Arena is a rationalist litRPG by /u/Gilgilad7. Participants must act and develop their capabilities optimally in order to survive deadly challenges in an arena created by a "sufficiently advanced technology".

  Thanks for the chapter! Question about the 5 hidden obelisks, the first race that finds them gets the elemental affinity bonus so does that confirm there is potential other hostile races in the starting zone?

    I'd love to know the answer to this as well - along with the species humanity is up against.

    The arena seems to be keeping the player races separate for the time being. It isn't clear if they're in completely different starting zones.

    That said, it is possible some of the other species are parasitical, very stealthy, or else casually indistinguishable from human. Some of the players we've seen could be non-human. Wristbands would reveal these imposters -- they wouldn't have the D- prefix on their player ID.

      I'm having a bit of trouble remembering all the terms here, honestly. IIRC there were four central zones circling around the Final Zone. Then each central zone has four secondary zones radiating around that, which our MC is currently in? So one in the center, four around it, and 16 total around those? Is the "starter zone" the same as those secondary zones, or is there a smaller subdivision we haven't had explained yet?

      It is interesting that we have only seen human PCs, so to speak, but if the pickup message was broadcast to *all* players in the zone, not just human ones, then it's likely we'll get a lot more conflict as the other species realize there's a huge advantage waiting to be picked up. If a species is able to acquire a few race-wide bonuses, then they could potentially snowball the whole thing.

        Some relevant stuff from [Chapter Six](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/27800/the-elemental-arena/chapter/418037/chapter-six-first-blood):

        > "... The main arena world is circular shaped.  You will begin in one of the starter zones that line the edges of the arena. You will need to cross a second layer of zones before then reaching the central zone.  All other zones are locked for now so you don’t have to worry about them for phase one."

        So, there are three concentric rings, much like a bullseye.

        From [Chapter Twelve](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/27800/the-elemental-arena/chapter/433649/chapter-twelve-aftermath):

        > "There are sixteen starter zones in the outer ring bordering the edge of the world,” Maya said. “We are in one of these zones. The second inner ring has four zones and they are considerably more difficult ..."

        Since there are eight species competing, it would be sensible for the starter zones to belong exclusively to each team (one pair per species). The second tier of zones would introduce up to three rival species. The central zone would have everyone left in a free-for-all.
        ```

        - u/meterion:
          ```
          Okay, that sounds about what I was imagining. The arena is set up [something like this](https://i.imgur.com/dubXoDE.png), not necessarily to scale. Pairing off the species makes sense as well, though it'd be more likely for the second tier of zones to introduce the rest of the rival species, unless some of them end up genocided before they beat the boss to unlock the zone.

  ```
  Fire is looking very impressive as a Prime.

  * Improved Heart allows skill activation 30% more frequently (likely better with higher skill).

  * Access to *Blunt Weapons I* and *Pole Weapons I*. If the scimitar's skill is Fire (to match the likely prime of the mini-boss who dropped it), that's three obtainable Physical +2 increases.

  * Fire's destructive opposite is Water, which admittedly is probably no joke in PvE. In PvP, however, enemies will likely optimize to use the element's healing powers at the expense of direct combat effectiveness.

  * We've now seen firsthand that Fire has a skill with a close AE attack.

  * *Quick Step I* enhances movement speed. Upgrading this an extra time or two should make it very difficult for enemies to get close enough to hit you.

  * >!And now, every human player left alive in the zone has an additional +1 to this affinity.!<
