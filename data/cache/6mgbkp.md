  I think that the high volume of rationalist fanfiction is a natural growth of a new genre. There are a lot of existing fantasy/scifi works that are viable targets for fanfics, and so these are the low-hanging fruit. That someone is doing the labour and picking these low-hanging fruits is a good sign, it means there's pent-up demand for the material.

  I think the next stage of the growth of the genre will happen when the fanfic readers/authors age a bit, and start writing *for real* (TM). There are early signs this is already happening - I like to think /u/salaris (Andrew Rowe), [ShaperV](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644/1/Time-Braid) (E William Brown), /u/FekketCantenel (Fiona van Dahl), /u/Raelifin (Max Harms) are the leading edge of rationalist authors. Other authors ([Dennis Taylor](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/12130438.Dennis_E_Taylor), Brandon Sanderson?) are ~~stealing~~ reusing the best ideas from rationalism and incorporating it in their works. So I'm cautiously optimistic that we'll see the genre grow, change, and be incorporated in more works.

    One should also not forget Sturgeon's Law, that 90% of everything is crap, other genres just make this slightly less obvious because they are popular enough that you don't hear about quite as much of the terrible stuff. You should expect that the more popular something becomes the more the refuse simply doesn't come to your attention.

      The other genres are just *barely* escaping this. Something as broad as *fantasy* was basically regarded as a low-grade shit not so long ago. It took a major success of Hollywood adaptations for the public to start taking fantasy seriously, even though it had good books all along.

      Yep, there is a gruesomely long way ahead of rational fiction.

        And now it's regarded as low-to-mid grade shit, barely an improvement. How often does a fantasy book win a Man Booker, a Pulitzer or a Nobel?

          If a potential reader dismisses a piece *just* because it has (or hasn't) elves in it, it is a problem. If he doesn't, it's a fundamental step up, as the work now has a non-zero chance to stand on its own merit.

    Thanks for the shout out!

    While I do draw some of my inspiration from rational fiction personally, I think there have been some other lines of genre development that are producing similar results. [**Hard fantasy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_fantasy) as a genre predates the more recent concept of rational fiction, and shares many of the same characteristics.

    Sanderson isn't stealing/reusing rational fiction ideas - his works predate them. (Elantris was published in 2005, and the Mistborn trilogy from 2006 to 2008. HPMOR started in 2010.) And Sanderson wasn't the first to write in this style - his "Laws of Magic" just popularized the idea. 

    I actually see this as a good thing - Sanderson's works predating/paralleling the development of rational fic just helps put more content out there that's going to be inspired by similar ideals. 

    I've drawn some influences from both Sandersonish traditional fiction and rational fic; I'd say that Forging Divinity was primarily Sanderson-inspired, whereas Sufficiently Advanced Magic was highly influenced by things like HPMOR and Mother of Learning. 

    All my books also draw from my background as a Systems Designer. My books are set in a universe I've been using for tabletops and LARPs for the last two decades. The cosmology iand some of the magic systems are drawn from those games, although the more recent one in Sufficiently Advanced Magic is more JRPG inspired. I'm also a professional game designer, and gaming is a big part of what has influenced the clear forms of progression and challenges in my writing. 

    You can see other people with gaming inspiration that write similar works - Maoyuu, Rokka no Yuusha, and Log Horizon, for example, all have similar elements to rational fiction, but they seem to draw primarily from gaming as their inspiration for this kind of rational/internally consistent style.

    I'm digressing a bit here, but my core point is actually that I think there have been parallel developments that have led to similar styles of fiction. 

    Sanderson embracing the idea of hard magic systems and internal consistency has done a lot for popularizing these concepts in the fantasy community - which is a good thing for rational fiction, because rational fiction is extremely similar to what Sanderson is writing and popularizing.
    ```

    - u/Afforess:
      ```
      I agree that a confluence of genres have been coming together towards the same sort of alignment. I mentioned Sanderson because [his most recent works](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31176804-snapshot) feels very much ripped from the pages of Mother of Learning or similar time-loopy stories. That's why I referenced Sanderson - not because I think his older works are the slightest bit rational, but because his latest works feel like a departure from his style, maybe into rationalism.

      There's also a rising bubble of *consistent* literature, namely the genres you mentioned: JRPG, LitRPG, Hard Fantasy, etc, where the universes are designed to have internally consistent rules. Sanderson is famous for this and his laws of magic. In these genres, authors agree to give up rule-breaking in exchange for credibility; the magical universe JK Rowling designed is silly and falls apart under scrutiny, the story only survives on the strength of the cast, the magical universe of Sanderson's cosmere is interesting, even devoid of a cast. However consistent literature isn't rationalist literature, but it often can feel like rational-lite.

      > As for the point about overpowered rationalist characters and 'giving Sauron the Death Star' — am I the only one recently getting a hankering to just write straight-up wish fulfillment and competence porn

      As the author of the linked rant: please do! I love them! I'm just disappointed when they run out of satisfying challenges to steamroll yet *just keep going*, which is a common problem. Please plan your ending ahead of time.

      (I've actually drifted out of reading the rationalist!Animorph precisely because of excess darkness.)
      ```

    - u/InfernoVulpix:
      ```
      The first thing that comes to mind when I think of overpowered protagonists and wish fulfillment is [Hope Through Overwhelming Firepower](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9912044/1/Hope-Through-Overwhelming-Firepower).  It's a worm fic that imports Taylor's different power from a universe where the power scales are so much larger than Worm's that Taylor really faces little threat.  Admittedly, the power is crippled when she gets it and needs to repair itself, so at first Taylor's 'just' a very powerful Blaster, but she quickly gets stronger and just as quickly tries to figure out how she can use her powers to help.  When I look back on it, though, despite the fact that Taylor never *really* feels like she's in true danger, I generally think of it as a fun romp that didn't overstay its welcome.

      Another thing that comes to mind is One Punch Man.  As a premise, by all rights it should be boring.  "Invincible guy who kills everything he fights in one punch".  What can you do with that?  Do you throw enemies at him who are too fast to hit, or something?  But the setting only affirms Saitama as invincible, instead focusing on his inability to get proper recognition for his heroic works or the struggle of the side characters who, while strong, can face true danger so long as Saitama's not there to insta-win the fight.

      If I may get analytical, I would guess that when people say conflict is needed for good stories, it's referring to how conflict draws outcomes into doubt in meaningful ways.  When whether your protagonist will live or die depends on whether he can win the fight against Evil Monster Man, your immersed self isn't confident that the protagonist will survive, and the future is cast into doubt.  For something like One Punch Man, once you're invested in Saitama getting the recognition he deserves, and Saitama then goes and does another amazing thing, the immersed you wants to know but can't be sure whether Saitama will get recognition.  For a peaceful story, then, what you first need is to immerse people in the story, and then you need to find a way to draw the future into doubt.  An easy option for this is research and experimental results, if the protagonists' plans depend on the experiment working out one way, you can build up tension and anticipation for the result just the same as if there was actual conflict and struggle.
      ```

      - u/JackStargazer:
        ```
        The One Punch Man analogy is actually very good. I think you capture it well. 

        If challenge isn't going to be the main point of the story, there has to be some non-violent conflict that the plot turns on.

        This is like playing a tabletop roleplaying game with a group who has optimized for combat. If you want something they can't just steamroll, make them do some things subtly or with intrigue.

  Well, I think for some budding rationalist authors early in their writing attempts, a pre-established world to play in to work on the rationalist aspect of writing is a great starting place.  A perfect example is Alexander Wales who wrote Metropolitan Man and Branches on the Tree of Time as rational fanfiction, but has moved into world-building fiction like Glimwarden, Shadows of the Limelight, and a few good original world short stories.

  One of the major flaws in your theory is simply that you are primarily looking at free online works of fiction which obviously is going to bring in a fair number of budding authors with little editing.  If you do the same with almost any other genre, the free online material is going to have a notable quality drop and probably have more examples of fanfiction.  That's not a disservice to any particular genre it is just the nature of online writing.
  ```

  - u/tonytwostep:
    ```
    That’s fair. For the genre of RF, it seems like most if not all *explicitly rational* works are in the “free online” category - but this is likely tied in with /u/Afforess ’s point that rational fiction is a very new genre, and currently we’re witnessing the growing pains of its development.

    As a separate, but related point: in my mind, Metropolitan Man stands somewhere close to the border between rational fanfiction and original rational fiction. Wales didn’t take an existing *story* and add in rational characters/elements; he took a few well-known characters, added more rational thought processes and motivations to said characters, and then wrote an entirely original story around them.

    Maybe that’s simply the difference between *good* and *bad* fanfiction (which seems supported by Yudkowsky’s Rules of Fanfiction), but when so much fanfiction falls into the latter group, perhaps more categorical distinctions (or, as /u/FekketCantenel suggests, some specific RF awards) are needed.
    ```

        Well, there *is* the [Intelligence in Literature Prize](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5lnj5r/announcement_intelligence_in_literature_monthly/) given out by MIRI.

- u/LupoCani:
  ```
  Regarding your second bullet point, I think we have a phrase for this- *If you make Frodo a Jedi, you must give Sauron the Death Star*. Powering up the protagonist is one thing, powering up everything else to match is another.

  A second problem is the *sustainability* of conflict. Two people with clubs, and two people with guns, are equally balanced conflicts, but the latter will still be over much faster. The best example, I think, is *Rules of Wishing*. Alladin, Jasmine and Jafar are all savvy enough to roughly match each other, but since the powers quickly escalate to WMD levels, it's all over in a couple of "moves" anyway.

  The claim that it's a writing cop out to use someone else's world for a rational fic is ridiculous--in fact, it's the opposite.  In an original work, if it's found that such-and-such a plot point is irrational or dumb, then the author can shrug their shoulders and unilaterally change the rules of the world to avoid the issue.  When using someone else's world, rather than ducking around the issue, the writer is more often than not forced to explain why it's consistent.  This may result in minor alterations or reinterpretations, but it's vastly more intellectually honest than being able to define the world from the start.  It invokes the imagery of a physicist struggling to explain the phonomenon around them, and not painters slapping paint wherever they damn well feel like putting it, even if it clashes.

  Consider Metropolitan Man.  If this were an original rational work, with a freakish alien coming to earth with the powers of a demigod, is there any guarantee that it has a weakness, let alone a magic rock?  Does it follow from that simple premise that Superman must have an easily applied Achille's heel?  I don't think so, and discovering that he was weak to copper would be considered incredibly narratively lazy and convenient.  But Alexander Wales wasn't working with just his own world, he was reconstructing someone else's, and so he was forced to explain why Kryptonite was a thing.  

  Given the premise of "Superman exists, and his greatest ally is a reporter and his greatest enemy is a businessman and his greatest weakness is a green rock", Wales was forced to constrain his work within those sharply defined boundaries.  There can be no cop-outs, no asspulls, no deus ex machina where it would come in conflict with the basic premise.  An original work can redefine the premise at will.  A rational fanfiction has no such flexibility and is thus anchored by its original canon, lest it cease to be Superman.

    > The claim that it's a writing cop out to use someone else's world for a rational fic is ridiculous--in fact, it's the opposite.

    I disagree. While I wouldn't reach so far as to call it a cop out (though we've all run across some works that cop out *hard*), I think it's much easier to write something in a world that's already been made for you. Like...*orders of magnitude* easier. This doesn't mean writing a good story is easy. But it's definitely less work, both from a creative and actuary standpoint.
    ```

  - u/Ozimandius:
    ```
    Well, I disagree that it is easier to handwave something and alter the rules of the world around problems that crop up.  The internal conflicts within an existing world propel the writing forward in a way that is much more difficult in your own world.  Having too many choices about what to write about is a far tougher problem for an author than working inside constraints.  Which is why it is much easier for new authors to approach existing worlds.
    ```

    - u/DaystarEld:
      ```
      I agree that it's easier to write fanfiction than original fiction, and even that it's easier to write rational fanfiction than original rational fiction, but I would say that a lot of the unique value of rational fiction can only really manifest in fanfiction, and that it takes a particular skill to do it that is not found in any other kind of fiction. 

      So I do think there are aspects to it that make rational fanfics harder in many ways than non-rational original works, even accounting for the ways fanfics are easier to write in general.

  > Fanfic authors use the fact that they’re building off of well-known canons to completely skip any significant world-building or character detail. Not only does this naturally exclude readers who aren’t as familiar with the original canon, but it seems like a bit of a writing copout - the fanfic author is essentially piggy-backing off of the “heavy lifting” of the original canon.

  Point, but this is essentially the same thing that new writers in established IPs (comics, movies, any other collaborative work on a single canon) do all the time. Any author writing in a genre using tropes is doing this too, to a greater or lesser extent, and I've seen fanfictions with better character development than published novels. To be derivative is to be human, fanfiction just embraces it as a contraint and jumping-off point.

  >Related to the above, because these rational fanfics often don’t have the same “meat” (character development, fully fleshed out rational worlds, etc) behind them as their original counterparts, they usually end up abandoned. I’ve found very few rational fanfic stories that are actually finished.

  Counterpoint: Stories go unfinished all the time, both in and out of the set of rational fanfics. When something's released serially online as it's being written, of course you see more examples of abandoned work, and it just happens that "released serially online" is the usual medium for ratfic.

  What you're talking about is nothing new. It's the logical result of the principle that 90-99% of everything written is bad. It's part of the growing pains of a new genre. When very few people write in the style, someone who likes the genre quickly runs out of their 1-10% slice of goodness into the morass of poorly-conceived, abandoned, and badly-written work out there. I know this, because I've written a few poorly-conceived, badly-written, and ultimately abandonned bits of ratfic. Writing is *hard*.

  Fanfic itself is smack-dab in the middle of this. The sheer accessibility (to writers) and availability (to readers) of the genre means that people tend to see the 99% of awful fanfic much more clearly than the 1% of good stuff. Ratfic, insofar as it overlaps with fanfic, is tarred by this as well. This isn't a judgement, just an observation. Fantasy and sci-fi went through the same crisis over the last half-century. You've got Heinlein, and then you have the pulp magazine featuring an alien robot kidnapping a naked woman. You've got Ursula K. LeGuin, and then you have muscly orcs kidnapping a naked woman.

  So, yeah. I'd argue that you're essentially right. The high volume of bad things tarnishes the good things by association. The bad things are mostly fanfic, because that has the lowest barrier to entry, just like bad fantasy tended to center around a few archetypes, or student films fall into the same traps of bad cinema over and over.

  However, I'd argue that it's a bit silly to try and do anything drastic about it. Any step we take to "curate" the volume of rational fiction means raising the barrier to entry, which is unfeasible and contrary to the point. Writers get better by writing, so let them write. We could start petitioning writers to start removing records of abandoned work from the internet, I guess, but that's a lot of work that fixes the symptoms, not the issue.

  I think the trick here is basically: wait, and write. Sometimes someone new will write something really cool, even if it's abandoned. Someone else might be inspired by that, and write something they actually finish. That has new ideas that get disseminated. And so on. Eventually, the cream floats to the top. Removing milk doesn't get you *more cream*. The only way to do that is to keep adding, and keep churning. (I don't actually know how cream is made)

  So, ways to improve: provide mentorship and community to people who want to write ratfic. Allow discussion of new ideas, and embrace both originality and iterative improvement on that which has come before. Make writing *good* ratfic more accessible rather than trying to make writing *bad* ratfic less accessible.

  It looks like the rest of the community has weighed in with basically similar points, but this is my take on it.
  ```

- u/Kishoto:
  ```
  I think part of the reason that there are so many rational fanfictions as opposed to original ratfic is that it's easier in many ways to make a rational fanfiction than it is to make an original fiction. It takes much less work overall and I think we can all agree that writing rational fiction at *all* takes more work than the average story. 

  It's easier for me to look at Naruto and say "well, of course chakra gundams make no goddamn sense based on the rules established!" than to create an entirely new world with a consistent set of rules and lore that manages to still be entertaining. Fanfiction makes writing overall easier (not that writing good fanfiction is easy but, outside of hardcore AU's, the canon provides a framework for you to "lean" your work against.)

  Wot overabundance?

- u/Trudar:
  ```
  TL;DR: I think the more the merrier, and we have to live with consequences if we want to read more good works.

  Think of it as a lure. When genre becomes popular, more people who like to write and create just wonder about, and then may try their luck and ultimately, whether their fruits of labour of (writing) love are good or not, they will learn, and possibly spread the word further. 

  Problems is, when genre has famous independent works that you can count on fingers of one hand, it shows its infancy. When the volume of written stories is high, probability of writers with good potential popping out is higher - and **we want  that**.

  You seem to criticize *bad* fanfiction stories. But it doesn't have to have anything to do with worldbuilding  or lack of it. You can take a EU and play with it - and your protagnist may as well bulldoze trought obstacle, or hit a wall devised by great antagonist, that will end up in high quality confrontation. Setting place for such events also takes certain skill, if you want your alterations to the universe to stay within predefined limits, especially if the changes are subtle. It's just different type of skill than playing a god and starting from scratch.

  But is it something bad, that authors skip the 'design from zero' phase? I think not - this is not a defining characteristic of a good story - even badly written one, with lot of mistakes from lack of experience can be entertaining, no need to thwart further efforts. Quite the contrary, I think - because writers need to practice on something. **Constructive criticism needs source material**.

  If anything, more threads akin to worldbuilding should appear here, like 'applied rational villainy 101: guide to creating conflicts and escalation', or 'how not to OP'.

  But statistic is a bitch: It is unavoidable, that at some point there will be flood of low-effort stories, and **you can't do anything about it**, because where there is no will (hence low-effort, no low-quality, that's the effect, not the cause), there will be no learning.

  In the end we will point out and promote good works - so writers coming across new challenge will instantly see the better material - and I think this is exactly what this subreddit is about.

  So i know its kinda offtopic but i dont think Worm, Mother of learning or Practical Guide to Evil ever were specifically meant to be written as "rational" fiction described in the side bar.

  Those 4 rules are basically rules of ANY good book and adding an additional label to them as rational fiction irks me because then most of well made fiction would be rational. In most good books things dont happen from nowhere. In most books characters act on their beliefs and values as it humanizes them and consistent rules are almost a must, really. Ofcourse it varies from book to book but they are the general things you could find in any decent one.

  I am glad the authors get the recognition they deserve as i have enjoyed their works and i wish them luck. Sorry for the offtopic but it always annoyed me and i wanted to get it out and the thread seemed somehow aproporiate. 

  On to the subject of your question its the same with everything. Majority of fiction is crap, you just dont see it because it filtered by publishers, reviewers and popularity. its just especially evident on internet because everybody and their mother, aunt, uncle, daughter and nephew can make an account of fictonpress, royalroad, wordpress, wattpad and start writing from the get go if they have anything of an artistic bone in their body or just enough of willingness to put these hours in. Its not always good and is mostly atrocious because they have never attempted writing before or learned anything worth noting from school.

    > Those 4 rules are basically rules of ANY good book

    I have to disagree here - rational-ising *Star Wars* would make it a *different* movie, and probably not a better (more enjoyable, culturally impactful) one.  "Rational" works of Lovecraft... wouldn't work.  *Discworld* is, for want of a better word, antirational and all the better for it.

    Sure, those four rules are key for realistic fiction aiming to evoke particular responses in the reader - but it's certainly possible to write excellent fiction without them.
    ```

  - u/tonytwostep:
    ```
    Well, if you agree with r/rational ’s 4 rules as being the criteria by which we judge fiction as rational or not, then Worm, MoL and PGtE are pretty clearly rational fiction, regardless of whether their authors explicitly intended them as such. I think this is fairly true of any genre - if we came up with some explicit criteria for Romance books, for instance, and someone wrote a Fantasy book that hit all those criteria, then we could certainly also consider it a Romance as well.

    If you DON’T agree with the 4 rules, then what criteria would you use? If rational fiction just consists of works whose authors have decided to self-label them as RF, then the genre is more or less completely subjective, and the rational fiction label has no meaning.

    And I fully agree with /u/PeridexisErrant ’s point - you may tend to enjoy novels that follow those 4 rules, but those rules are clearly not the “basic rules of any good book”. *Lord of the Rings* hits maaaaybe two of those rules, yet it still seems pretty well regarded…

  I feel that this is probably a signalling problem. 

  Claiming that your fic is rational is, essentially, a free signal. This means that anyone who wants to claim this can, and will, use the signal, which renders it meaningless.

    ```
    I don't think it is a free signal, though.

    First, there're a number of people with a bias against the rationalist movement, so labeling a fic rational will hurt your readership there.

    Second, the ratfic community is quite willing to criticize ratfics for being irrational.  Keeping a fic rational is hard, labeling your fic rational means you've opened yourself up to criticism there too.

  I disagree with your premise that there's an overabundance of rational fiction. 

  Rational fiction is about *one* common problem that fiction writers often fail to solve--characters making really stupidly unrealistic decisions . But there are *lots* of other problems, like the ones you list, that it says nothing about. The problem is that there aren't enough extremely skilled writers who solve *all* of these problems, not that there is too much rational fiction.
