## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  You have the power to move from this Earth to a different, unspoiled Earth where humans died out thousands of years ago. You can take up to 140 pounds with you, so long as the thing you're taking with you fits entirely within a radius extending two meters from your center of gravity.

  The other Earth has its own weather, distinct from our own. The landscape is generally the same, except where human intervention has changed it.

  When you transfer over, you are not guaranteed to be safe from changes in air pressure, nor are you guaranteed that you will be safe in the environment, or that you will be at a safe distance from the ground. The transfer retains your precise position with respect to distance from sea level, longitude, and latitude.

  You can make the move from one Earth to the other once per hour. Initiating the transfer happens at the speed of thought.

  If an intersection would occur (i.e. you would transfer into a place that's occupied by a steel girder, block of granite, or another person) the other matter will be transferred to the other Earth that you've just left. This also applies to anything you bring through with you. While this prevents some severe potential catastrophes, transferring to, for example, the interior of a boulder would leave you without oxygen to breathe.

  To your knowledge, you are the only person who has this ability.

  * How do you make the most money within a one year timeframe, legally or otherwise? In a ten year timeframe?
  * What equipment do you take for your first few trips?
  * How do you ensure your safety in the long-term?

      > If matter is substituted where you go to, and you can use it to move your body's volume of stone from a boulder, you can use it to circumvent the 140lb limit.

      I was wondering how easy that loophole was to see. I'm not planning to write a story for this question, but I *was* thinking about what the story would look like, and having a loophole like that allows for plot progression in a way that I find pleasing ... so long as it's not bloody obvious from the outset, and people are left wondering why the protagonist didn't leap to that conclusion from the outset.

      I'm curious. Why would your personal goal be to de-extinct passenger pigeons, or at least, why that species in particular. I know that their extinction is due to humans but the same can be said of other species as well.

      I definitely think it's a cool goal to pursuit and would probably use the powers in the similar way in trying to discover species that that have been lost due to human actions.

      I guess I feel a bit surprised to read that here since in my personal experience I feel like most people in the rationalist community are more concerned with the advancement of technology than the conservation of nature, not to say that the rationalist community don't care about nature but that I haven't seen much topic on it being discussed.

          That's really cool. I'll check out Hominids.

          I feel like such an ambition in this hypothetical world would be difficult though. In addition to potentially bringing back an extinct species I feel like a lot of contingencies would be needed to ensure that no diseases are transferred between worlds.

          In addition to spreading potentially invasive species to and from worlds, plant pathogens could surely cause their own scale of damage and that's not counting the things that animal pathogens can do.

          Unless this teleportation removes any disease I feel like this new world is only going to suffer from the moment humans are involved.

    There's short-term and long-term safety. Short-term safety is dominated by worries like "how do I make sure I don't get stuck in a boulder". Long-term safety is dominated by worries like "how do I prevent powerful agents from exploiting me in ways I do not like."

    Fortunately, short-term safety should be mostly fixed by easy fixes like bringing

    * a hunting rifle

    * two hours' supply of oxygen

    * another person, possibly ex-military, with duplicates of this gear (EDIT: 140 pounds weight makes this tough, but it might be possible if he or she is very slim)

    * something to prevent your death when you possibly fall between 20 and 1000 feet (possibly a combination of multiple systems, like a compact parachute and something else)

    Although now that I think about it, the safest place to transfer over blind is probably the ocean: go out in a small rowboat about 100-200m offshore, transfer, since your position is preserved relative to sea level you should continue to be in the ocean. After this, row to shore while recording everything, and transfer back depending on how far away from shore you are on Earth Two. Be recording with several GoPros while you're doing this, and when you get back, piece together the videos of the Earth Two with videos of that region of Earth One to figure out if there's super different geography. If there's not, your next trip back and forth can be in the boat, but slightly closer to the shore. Repeat until you find a safe place of the shore to transfer on, and work your way inland until you get to property that is convenient for you to access.

      I would prefer a enclosed floating life capsule to a rowboat. What happens when you teleport into the middle of a big swell and are under 40 feet of water?

    You'd make a terrifying "suicide" bomber. Walk into the place carrying a deadman's switched concealed explosive, teleport out to a pre-prepared safe zone, and leave the carnage behind. If you set up your bombs to emit blinding light just before you leave, cameras would be unable to catch your disappearing act, and you would go in heavily disguised every time anyway.

    This would obviously require you to be a psychopath, however. The other means of making money I can think of involve resource extraction on the unspoiled earth, but it would be glacially slow due to lack of extra labor. If you can find a record of easily-available Platinum ore or something, you could make quick cash by obtaining it, however.

    Geez everyone is talking about being rich and here I am imagining how I'd use it to create a new society on the alternate earth by taking several trips worth of light humans from hunter-gatherer societies who would have the requisite skills and appropriate, simple, reliable weapons and fabrics and shelters. And periodically take frozen sperm across to greatly increase genetic diversity.

    I remember reading somewhere that modern hunter gatherers work less and are happier than anyone else, so it'd be fun to test that out with the full knowledge that i can hop back to the real world at any point.

    Fort Knox, going where the Gold should be. (Having a hard to remove mask would make sure I don't get recognised when caught until I can teleport again.)

    Maybe stealing from any other secure facility. (Like go in an art museum and shift with painting)


    Maybe finding out where Big Diamonds or other crystals were found. 

    Legal I would consider radioactive stuff, but I am a coward so fck that

    Build many homes around the alt earth. (with the stolen money) And lightweight plane. Use weather stations.

    If not necessary always act like I can only do it once a day.

    Get small people over there and let them produce drugs there. They don't know they are on a different earth.

    You can mine for gold without actually doing any digging. 

    Get a 2m x 2m reinforced steel box & go inside with enough scuba tanks to last you an hour. Go to a location of historical gold mines, places with a lower elevation than before the human gold rush. Go inside the box & warp. You will end up underground & a block of stone will be offset to human earth. Get an assistant to move the box of stone that you offset & check it for precious minerals before you teleport back (if the stone block is worthless, put it back into the position where you left human earth from so that it is returned). Repeat until you get something.

    First trip - make switch in a coastal location to limit potential change in land height and switch on top of a mattress held 1m above the ground. Mattress and scaffolding holding it are taken upon teleportation, therefore if land is lower mattress protects me from the fall and if land is higher only scaffolding goes beneath ground. I would also take a gun to defend against any hostile wildlife, though they'd be unlikely to attack an unknown form of animal. The first trip would be extensively videoed to prove I have the ability.

    On subsequent trips I would create a mining company and use more expensive equipment to safely travel to valuable sites (gold deposits, places where exceptionally large gemstones were found) and make money that way.

      I was thinking:

      Step 1: Zorb 

      Step 2: scuba with rebreather

      If I fall, I get Zorbed. If I sink, I can still breathe for an hour.

      You could capture rare or extinct wildlife and sell to national parks

      Similar-ish, but I think there's a massive difference between being the only one who can move between Earths and everyone being able to.

    An unspoiled earth, unfouled by human greed?

    I'd offer my services as a nuclear waste disposal specialist.

  TL;DR you are a "magic talking sword", how do you achieve your goals?

  You are a sentient sword in a D&D-style high fantasy world, with a twist. You're actually a knife-missile-style drone from a Culture-like civilization. Unfortunately, your flight capabilities are broken, so you must find a willing sack of meat to carry you around and stick the evildoers with you.

  Powers:

  * Immortality - you've got tens of thousands of years or more, if necessary, to achieve your goals.

  * You can talk by sending sound waves through the air

  * You can read the thoughts/communicate via telepathy with anyone touching you. You can't use this to gaslight/plant false thoughts/manipulate your wielder in a way that involves pretending your thoughts were originally theirs.

  * You are obscenely sharp and never dull.

  * You are immune to the magic of the era, whatever that is.

  * Limited effectors give you holograms/fine-grained manipulation/pyrotechnics within about ten centimeters of your surface. You *could* use this for anything from "pretend to be a neat glowy sword" to "record and play back video for your bearer."

  You have unspecified goals that at default include "bring peace and prosperity," "disincentivize evildoers," etc. Or, for fun, try to rule the world.

    Depending on my database, teach the idiots how to do stuff. Like magic scroll printing press. Or how education is good for peasants.

    Starting a bank system. That I control.

    Find an immortal I like and have him/her as pet and hands

    Learn magic (and use Wish). Train mindcontrolled mages until they can make Wish spells for me. (Maybe use shortcut of scrolls)

    Make taskforces for specific threats (like group of paladins to fight undead) get enough priests to search all lands for undead.

    Get some of the necromancers in a taskforce to fight monster with poison.

    And sometime after killing all gods I don't like I ascend to godhood.

    Fine-grained manipulation? What prevents me from building myself some limbs and walking off? And then using my fragment of the Culture database (or whatever, don't know how that works) to make nanotech and achieve technological victory?
