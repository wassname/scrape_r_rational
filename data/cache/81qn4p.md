## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  You have the power to spread disease. That is, the power to *spread* it, not manufacture it. Whenever you see two people that are within 100m of each other, you can infect one with any disease that the other has. You just need to see both people, not touch or go near them. There is no limit to the number of times you can use this ability. You can only spread diseases that are caused by germs, not injuries or genetic problems. Can this power be used to become rich/conquer the world/help humanity?

    Are you immune to any diseases? Can you ~~move~~ Shift the disease from one to another, without making both have the disease? 

    Can you use any of your ability on yourself?  This is incredibly powerful, but still somewhat dangerous, especially if you go seeking rarer diseases, because even if you don't need to touch the afflicted, you might expose yourself to other diseases along the way.


    The power to transfer say, HIV from one person in a crowd, to everyone else in a crowd and within such a short period of time is VERY powerful.

    Point of information for others to use: most people have a butt-ton of asymptomatic diseases, so even a single person would be a vector for a few dozen diseases.

    Question: Does it work on animals? I'm guessing not because you said 'people' but if it works on animals I can carry a bat with rabies around with me... (in a cage!)

    Question: By 'germ' I assume you're using a catch-all designation for viruses/bacteria. Do parasites (e.g. rabies) count? Do prions (e.g. mad cow) count? What about toxins (e.g. poison mushroom, medication overdose)?

    Question: Can you tell what diseases someone has by looking at them?

    Question: Do you have to see them IRL or, for example, if you watched a video of a president giving an address to a large crowd, you could give the president the worst disease in the crowd?

    Generally, if I have the ability to identify diseases, I'd use that to be some sort of medical psychic and win a bunch of skeptic prizes, use that fame and some cold reading to become famous that way and I'm rich. (Even without identifying diseases, I can also "predict" who will get which diseases by causing them, cast "curses", and so on: the problem is if people are able to prove I did it I could go to prison and that would suck). 

    If I wanted to help humanity, I'd get some of the worst diseases in the world and bring them to rich people - multi-millionaires tend to start charities to raise money and awareness for diseases that people they know have, so I'd take advantage of that.

    I can't think how I'd conquer the world, short of killing probably the entire population of England and then also most of Australia and getting myself on the British throne somehow, and I'm not sure I'd even be eligible as I was born out of wedlock and the British royal family has weird rules like that (my parents, who have been together since 1980, finally got married three years ago because they went to vegas and they figured they had to since that's what you do there; but I digress...).

    In conquering the world and/or helping humanity, I'd also do some Kira-like vigilantism, which would be an easier feat if I could carry a rabid bat around with me which I probably can't. I don't think this would be very easy as the sort of people I'd most want to kill in this context would be people who would have good access to medicine and poor access to really, really sick people.

      I'm going to limit the ability to only work on humans, and only on diseases that actually affect the first target. So you cannot bring around some kind of carrier who is immune to tons of diseases but carries all of them.

      I will allow parasites and prions, but not toxins. The disease has to be something that can reproduce itself and so look like it could have spread without your ability. Rule of thumb: if the disease can be spread by taking blood from one person and injecting it into the other, your ability will work.

      No you cannot tell what diseases someone has by looking at them. But you can say, see that someone is coughing, and spread whatever disease is making him cough to another person without knowing what that disease is. Your ability will fail if his cough isn't actually a disease (or the target you are trying to spread the disease to is immune to that disease), but there are no penalties or side effects from failed uses of your ability.

      > If I wanted to help humanity, I'd get some of the worst diseases in the world and bring them to rich people - multi-millionaires tend to start charities to raise money and awareness for diseases that people they know have, so I'd take advantage of that.

      You just blew my mind. That is a very unorthodox approach to curing disease, but I can't see any reason why it wouldn't work.

      Hmm. Yeah, you would need to somehow get them near fatally ill people, which would probably require you to get accomplices willing to abandon their hospital treatments to come around with you. It also wouldn't be very safe, since the diseases you spread may end up spreading on their own, killing innocent people by accident. For example, if you go visit an imprisoned serial killer with your accomplice, and spread rabies to him, the serial killer may later bite another prisoner and then the disease may end up spreading to the entire prison before it is caught.

    Honestly your best bet with this power is almost certainly to use it to spread colds/influenza in controlled circumstances in order to prove you have powers and get rich/famous. At some point in the future there might be utility from this power in that you can use it to rapidly spread retroviruses and that it's creating matter from nothing, thus preventing the heat death of the universe long term.          

    Fundamentally using this to spread pandemics just isn't likely to serve you any good, and you'd probably get caught pretty quickly (since the CDC is smart enough to know if a disease looks like it's spreading through deliberate infection).
