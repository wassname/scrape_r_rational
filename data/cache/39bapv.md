  this is a new story I've started. My last one I intend to publish in the traditional fashion, so I didn't share it, but this one I specifically intend to share, and I invite others to contribute story ideas or even characters. 

  The setup is simple. In 2065, a 40 kilometre wide comet slams into the earth at 59 km/s. There may be survivors, but the conditions on the Earth are inhospitable, and at the very least all of civilisation was brought to its knees in an instant. 
  The story centers around the crew of the Opis II mission to Saturn, who watched the drama unfold on the Earth behind a 75 minute signal lag, helpless to save their world. The Earth is gone, the only surviving members of the human race may be the 20 member crew of Opis II, and the 50 person strong colony at Valles Marineris. The goal of the Opis II is simple: survive. Keep the human race going.

  This looks interesting. I'm unfamiliar with the site you're using to publish it, is there an RSS feed?
