## [D] Monday General Rationality Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics!  Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world?  Have you:

* Seen something interesting on /r/science?
* Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
* Figured out how to become immortal?
* Constructed artificial general intelligence?
* Read a neat nonfiction book?
* Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?

  I was watching [Son of Dracula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Son_of_Dracula_(1943_film\)) for research purposes, and it's not a rational film, but it was interesting to watch a film that was so very, very old. 

  There were some things I was put off by but completely unsurprised by (the main character calling her black servants 'boys', a situation that to modern sensibilities might ring alarm bells for an abusive marriage being treated as normal), but there was one thing I really didn't understand and I'm wondering if it was a plot hole or if it was just the was society *was*, or if I'm too much in a rationalist transhumanist bubble. 

  Anyway, the arc I'm curious about goes like this:

  - Kay is engaged to Frank, but is dating Count Alucard (really) on the side

  - She marries Alucard and Frank sees them together and is understandably hurt

  - After she marries him, Alucard turns Kay into a vampire

  - Kay visits Frank and explains her plan to him: she wanted to be turned into a vampire so she'd live forever, and now she's a vampire, she can turn Frank into a vampire too and they can be together forever. She just needs Frank to kill Alucard so there's no loose end

  - Frank is so horrified by this proposition that he *doesn't even consider it*, and after killing Alucard in a dramatic show-down, he finds Kay sleeping in her coffin

  - He takes a ring off his finger, puts it onto hers, cries, and then up and sets her coffin alight in cold blood

  - There's no beat where he's sad or anything, it just goes straight to "THE END" and a reminder to buy war bonds

  I'm like - they didn't address that he'd been offered immortality, like, *at all*!? No line from him about it being an affront to God? No line about it not being worth all the people he'd have to kill (it's not explicit whether vampires must kill humans to feed - it seems they don't)? No fuckin' line about how he'd really like to be with her but they wouldn't be able to have children and continue the family name? It's just taken as a complete given that Frank wouldn't even consider turning into a vampire to be with Kay. 

  So, is it bad writing? 1940s sensibilities? My rationalist/transhumanist bubble? Discuss.

    Although the comments the others have made are rather short, they have a strong point. Vampires weren't their own category of creature: they are first and foremost a creature of horrors, Evil with a capital E, the kind you fear will drink your blood at night. All the other traits are specific to how they are represented in stories, until they become common enough to be consistent; they aren't central to what it originally meant to be a vampire. The immortality of vampires is a trait that is used to coax people into becoming evil, and Kay is shown to have fallen for it. For the people of this context, and indeed for most people today, the rational benefits are inconsequential to the main plot point.  


    Perhaps this is comparable to *the power of love.* In many pop movies, the main character has to choose between something and *love* and generally love is picked even though it appears to be the worse option. Of course, since in popular media the main character's decision is always correct, it turns out there was a hidden benefit to it. Most people take it for face value \- love is good \- rational decisions don't have a chance to come in. Perhaps my view is incorrect, I do not watch many movies. I know in particular though, that the latest Spiderman movie did break this mould, much to my surprise.

      I really appreciate this comment, I'm beginning to get it. Especially the analogy about *the power of love*. I can see people from 1918 and 2118 being equally confused about our modern movies with *the power of love*. I might have to see if I can find a copy of *The Daughter of Dracula* to see if vampires are treated similarly there, except for the fact that *Son of Dracula* was so boring that I'm not sure I want to sit through a similar movie that my romance novel protagonist wouldn't been likely to have seen.

        It's also worth pointing out that rationalists are much less appalled by [taboo tradeoffs](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/psychology-of-taboo-tradeoff/) than general populace. 

        >When people are asked to trade their sacred values for values considered to be secular—what psychologist Philip Tetlock refers to as a “taboo tradeoff”—they exhibit moral outrage, express anger and disgust, become increasingly inflexible in negotiations, and display an insensitivity to a strict cost-benefit analysis of the exchange. What’s more, when people receive monetary offers for relinquishing a sacred value, they display a particularly striking irrationality. Not only are people unwilling to compromise sacred values for money—contrary to classic economic theory’s assumption that financial incentives motivate behavior—but the inclusion of money in an offer produces a backfire effect such that people become even less likely to give up their sacred values compared to when an offer does not include money. People consider trading sacred values for money so morally reprehensible that they recoil at such proposals.

    Reading this it does sound as if he's sad in that he cries and does the thing with the ring. In the days when Men Didn't Cry that was probably enough. Also you must remember that Vampires don't have souls, so to him she already died.
    ```

    - u/MagicWeasel:
      ```
      I don't know if he "cried" (they didn't exactly film in 4K in 1943) but he had a mournful moment. 

      I wish the movie had been more  explicit about exactly what he was concerned about, regarding the soul or whatever. It was the most fascinating part of the film, because it was just completely glossed over as though it'd be obvious.
      ```

    I love that it cuts to a reminder to buy war bonds. I know that was just the way things were done back then, but it comes off as if the movie was a 90 minute commercial to "Buy WAR BONDS, or a vampire fiance could happen to you, too!" 

    (Though, I suspect that this would not be a strong incentive to buy war bonds, in your case >:P )

    So... vampires are kinda *evil*. It's only in the last few decades where that changed. [Interview with a Vampire](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43763.Interview_with_the_Vampire) was published in... 1976. Maybe there's something older that portrays vampires in a sympathetic light, but I don't care to research it. Point is, vampires are evil, and it shouldn't need to be explained that no sane person would actively choose to become a monster.

      Vampire!Kay seems to be just like her normal self, though. She seems to have the same thoughts, feelings, desires, etc - she's continuing her plan to get immortal with Frank, after all. She doesn't kill anyone and makes no plans to. 

      Count Alucard kills a fortune-teller (yes, *of course* there's a Romani fortune-teller) in the first minutes of the film, kills Kay's father (actually - Kay may have been complicit in that, but that was while she was human) and Alucard leaves a young boy for dead after feeding from him, and he tries to kill Frank and the Professor, before the Professor whipped out a handy cross, so Alucard's pretty evil. But Kay wasn't presented as evil or even misguided or anything. 

      I'm just shocked the movie didn't even have Frank say to her, "what? Why would I want to be transformed into an *evil demon*?", he just was disgusted and said no and then set her on fire first chance he got. 

      I'm trying to think of what modern concept the 1940s concept of a vampire maps onto so I can understand what the viewers at the time were thinking when they saw Frank turn Kay down. Like, I know that Romani people were seen as mystical and magical in the time, I know that African-Americans were seen in a very different way, but I don't know what people then thought of vampires. 

      I can't liken it to modern zombies because modern zombies have no higher brain functions. So I'm trying to figure out what that concept can *map onto*. The nearest I can think of is maybe, like, "a thinking and feeling being who is considered by society to be evil with no possible redemption" - so, like, a pedophile or something? Like if it turned out that pedophiles got immortality, would I want to become a pedophile?  (blah blah blah non-offending pedophiles blah blah blah). 

      So yeah, that's where I'm confused/struggling. Were vampires really considered so EVIL that not wanting to be one went without saying? When at least in *Son of Dracula* they have their own agency and aren't like starving zombies?

        Vampires represent degenerated elites. For modern sensibilities it would be like asking "do you want to become slave owner?" It's not the question that makes moral people weight pros and cons.

        I think you're maybe trying a little too hard to map the logic of that one movie to values shared by everyone in the expected audience.

        It's like if someone in 2118 watched *Avengers: Infinity Wars*, watched Thanos's character and went "Uh, I guess these people used to think death was an acceptable answer to overpopulation back then". Okay, so it's a little different because Thanos is portrayed as the villain (is he though? the movie spends a lot of time focusing on his perspective and his emotional struggle), but my point is, movie characters don't have to make sense, especially in big budget movies.

  Most of my political commentary podcasts are left-wing, so I'm looking for a podcast or two on the political right to round things out and reduce the opacity of the bubble that I'm living in. 

  I would prefer to not listen to someone who supports Trump *in general* (support of specific actions or policies is fine) and I don't want to listen to someone who's going to be spending time making fun of the opposition. I'm not here for bad jokes or sick burns, and even when I *agree* with the host, I tend to find myself wishing that we'd get back to the subject. It would also be nice if the host isn't religious, because there's no chance in Hell that I'm going to be convinced by an argument whose foundation is "Because Jesus." 

  Non-U.S. podcasts are fine, since I'm less interested in right-wing thoughts on particular issues than in right-wing *thought*, period.

  - u/ben_oni:

    I don't listen to podcasts, and I've only kept half an ear on politics for the past year, but I think [The (National Review) Editors](https://www.nationalreview.com/podcasts/the-editors/) is what you're looking for. While essentially defining what right-wing conservatism is, these guys famously gave Trump an *anti*-endorsement in 2016. They know the issues, can speak intelligently about them, and stay on point.

    I think they still have a left lean, but they seem to try harder than most for balance. You might like reconsider. It's not a current event's podcast, but it's quite good. [https://www.reconsidermedia.com/podcast/](https://www.reconsidermedia.com/podcast/)

  I would love advice on how to disassociate certain things from my ex and how you force myself to stop forward trending thought spirals.

    Time works, not too much else. Getting rid of the mental trigger stuff and keeping busy work acceptably well. E.g. Seal away those fotos, favourite movies, books, mp3 files etc away and get a hobby where you get out lots and meet new peope. 

    As for the thought spirals, they can be a symptom of depression - any chance thats it? If so, treat it. 

    Thought spirals are hard to keep up when the body is busy and tired -start with regular cardio, or just run for a while until your brain is too busy breathing.

      It has been over a year since the break up. I just had a bit of a breakdown this Monday and last. Was hoping I'd be past those experiences. Especially for a short relationship.

      I do have depression. I'm going to therapy but I feel tired all the time. I do work out and exercise but rarely have enough energy to put my all into it.

        Yeah, unfortunately the thought spirals are such a big part of depression, I got no further advice. Best of luck, I'd love to get irregular updates if you are doing better.

  I mentioned it in Friday's thread, but has anyone else read [Enlightenment Now: The Case for Reason, Science, Humanism, and Progress](https://www.amazon.com/Enlightenment-Now-Science-Humanism-Progress/dp/0525427570). I just finished listening to the audio book and will be reading the physical book once I get a chance. I would say it's the best description of how I feel about a lot of issues and actually directly mentions the rationalist movement, though not in the context of fiction.

  In essence, the book attempts to make the case for enlightenment ideals. It argues, that they have been important it human progress along with laying out the evidence that humans are indeed progressing. He also makes an argument that there is a large group of intellectuals who are anti enlightenment. I agree with almost everything he said, which is honestly the biggest problem I had with the book. It didn't leave me re-evaluating many of my positions.

  As I mentioned before he does argue that the potential for catastrophic disaster is over stated. I think he's only partially right. He states that since it takes a large group to create a powerful weapon one mad man can't then use one to destroy the world. I think the problem here is that in many cases the information may be hard to create, but using it may be easy. Let's say biologists in the next 10 years perfect gene editing to the extent that it's cheap and easy to build a totally synthetic virus. At that point all that is necessary is for someone to leak the information for a super virus and information is very hard to contain.

  I'm writing a story that isn't exactly a rational fiction, but uses a rational setting (consistent rules, realistic).  As part of the this, I've been reworking all the mechanics of the games into something that makes more sense.  One thing I'm not sure about is how to do a rational explanation or alternative to pokemon evolution by trading.

  I have two ideas at this point.
  1. In the wild, evolution by trade is actually a result of migration
  2. Results from moving between different "packs" of that species, like when a male lion leaves the pride it was born into to make or take another.

  Any suggestions would be much appreciated.  Thank you.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    The two ideas you already have are good. A possible third one is that Pokemon have co-evolved alongside humans for so long that trading has become part of their standard life cycle.
    ```

  - u/hh26:
    ```
    Imo, evolution by trading one of the more questionable mechanics in the games, and I would certainly remove it if I made a pokemon game.  I'm not entirely sure if it's appropriate to remove in a fanfic, in which every change is likely to meet some resistance.  However, I believe this mechanic is removed in the anime, where we occasionally see trade-pokemon evolve without being traded, so I would recommend just removing it.
    ```

  - u/phylogenik:
    ```
    hmm, how about --

    Pokemon evolution (/near-instantaneous maturation/metamorphosis, bypassing normal developmental pathways) is an exceptionally costly event, and carries some substantial risk of sterility or substantial germline mutation (due to the incredible energies released, some of it in the form of [heat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat-based_contraception) and [radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiobiology#Health_effects)) or death (in the case cancer development and overdepletion of the body's energy reserves -- maybe to the point of temporary lethargy, maybe even to death itself).

    As such, in the wild it is to be avoided except as a measure of last resort, when the alternative is certain death. Usually, it is triggered by extreme trauma, such as one might find through exposure to violent combat. Hence, its induction through the accumulation of stressful fighting experience -- eventually, some threshold is reached, and whatever body systems monitor these things "decide" that metamorphosis is preferable to its usually much safer and more stable alternative. 

    Alternative triggers to pokevolution can also include environmental stressors, such as direct exposure to [dangerous substances](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Evolutionary_stone). Some especially eusocial species of Pokemon build elaborate communities and find their strength through interdependent social structure. To them, loss of community (through exile or cataclysm) carries not only substantial risk of death, but also extreme emotional trauma. This emotional trauma serves as such an excellent proxy of impending need for "fighting strength", and this association over anagenic (previously "evolutionary", at term which is now deprecated) time has allowed the emotional trauma itself to serve as "evolutionary" trigger.

    When captured by a pokeball, pokemon undergo substantial neurological restructuring as part of a brainwashing regime that ensures obedience to their "trainer". This is often glossed over in popular understanding, but is required for hitherto aggressive pokemon to abandon their prior lives and enslave themselves to their new masters for the purposes of vicious bloodsport. The act of trading, then, induces feelings of traumatic separation and abandonment -- a severance of the bond between slave and master. In aforementioned eusocial Pokemon species, this can be enough to trigger metamorphosis.
    ```
