## Reed Richards is Not Useless

### Post:

So there's this thing in comics where no matter how rich or smart certain people are, they never use their assets to affect large scale improvements. Are there any works, comic or otherwise that have characters avert this such as Dr. Manhattan synthesizing lithium or Soviet Superman making a functional Soviet Union?

  According to SMBC a rational superman should not fight crime.

    I think in settings where Superman's powers are incomprehensible and static and there regularly appear existential threats (in the form of Darkseid, Doomsday, General Zod, etc.) whose primary mechanism of defeat is "getting punched really hard"  it makes sense for Superman to focus on honing his punching abilities, keeping keen his sense of justice and heroic responsibility, etc. If he stops to focus on mundane utilities and his punching skills falter the world is quickly forfeit.

    In other settings, [I personally disagree](https://nikvetr.wordpress.com/2016/07/20/superman-effective-power-application/) that transporting grain, plowing farmland, or cranking a generator are anywhere near the best applications of Superman’s powers.

      I really don't like the message that comic is trying to convey. Superman is not obligated to dedicate the entirety of his time and energy to be maximally efficient at benefiting humanity. First of all because nobody is obliged to do that (good people are still allowed to have a life) and second of all because people need downtime to remain sane and maintaining the mental well-being of the most power being on the planet is kind of a high priority.

      Also, there is absolutely no way the best use for supermans powers is to spin a dynamo all day long, even if you agree that unlimited energy is the best goal to strive for. Worst case scenario: just have him build and run a park of nuclear power plants and dump the waste products in the sun. He can keep the damage contained if a meltdown threatens to occur and if we run out of fissionables he can just pop over to an asteroid with a high uranium content and get us some more. 

      Edit: This was supposed to be a reply to /u/ThorShield's post.

    Seconding this. Best demonstration of that principle that I can think of.

  [The trope page](https://allthetropes.org/wiki/Reed_Richards_Is_Useless) explicitly lists [Alternate-Universe Reed Richards Is Awesome](https://allthetropes.org/wiki/Alternate_Universe_Reed_Richards_Is_Awesome) as the opposite of this trope. The latter page provides several examples of heroes that change the status quo.

  The principle was set early on that you couldn't have Superman winning World War II when World War II was actually going on. That established a trend that no matter what superheroes did it couldn't really have long term consequences.

  I read that at some point Lex Luthor became President. Presumably he had a plan for using his super science to effect social change. What exactly happened there?
  ```

    Lex has been president three times, as seen [here](http://www.denofgeek.com/us/books-comics/superman/260081/lex-luthor-and-the-three-times-he-was-elected-us-president) - you can guess how it ended.

      _Red Son_ seems to be the only one arguably rational.
      ```

- u/thrawnca:
  ```
  How rational do you want? With This Ring leans in a rational direction, though not strongly, and certainly opposes the trope.
  ```

  - u/DangerouslyUnstable:
    ```
    I'd argue that With This Ring is a very rational protagonist forced to live in a highly irrational setting.
    ```

- u/phylogenik:
  ```
  I think most sci-fi would qualify, though oftentimes there the supergeniuses are unnamed entities in the past, or more “well-coordinated teams of engineers” and “international conglomerates of scientists” than singular individuals. I guess in those cases the progress itself is not shown unless the work is a space opera spanning centuries or something.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    I mean, Schlock Mercenary is pretty good about this. Near the beginning, a scientist/engineer develops effective FTL teleportation. This sets off massive upheaval as the monopolies on the clunkier FTL is overturned, teleportation blockers and teleportation blocker blockers are developped, obseleted superweapons become viable now they can be easily teleported around, etc.

  With This Ring is superb and all about this.

    Any sign of completion on the horizon? I went through it like a year ago, but SV is a godawful place to host something that size, and I could never figure out how to just get a link to the latest update emailed to me when it posted, so I didn't keep up.
