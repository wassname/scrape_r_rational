    The Latin nerd in me wants to gently correct that to "infernum", in the nominative rather than ablative case.
    ```

- u/traverseda:
  ```
  This chapter has some pretty obvious kabbalistic implications.
  ```

  - u/Darth_Hobbes:
    ```
    You should post this comment in every chapter discussion.
    ```

    - u/PeridexisErrant:

      That's because every chapter has kabbalistic implications, which is not a coincidence, and is therefore kabbalistic.

      For example, to 'traverse' an array of some information is to visit each item in the array, such as chapters in a story.  An "eda" is a norse epic story, and the person identifying kabbalistic implications of each chapter is Named /u/traverseda.  This is not a coincidence either.

        The twist: This story is a secret attempt to destroy us as rationalists, by slowly training our sense of pareidolia until we are incapable of distinguishing noise from signal.
        ```

        - u/PeridexisErrant:
          ```
          There's no need to propose a gigantic conspiracy to degrade the rationalist capabilities of the general public - background incompetence is much more likely to be a coincidence.

            > much more likely to be a coincidence.

            If you believe in such things.
            ```

    - u/traverseda:
      ```
      I've got a strategy[.](#n "Some day, there's going to be kabbalistic *invocations*" ) But yes.
      ```

- u/LiteralHeadCannon:
  ```
  Somehow I find this depiction of Peter Singer much more sympathetic than his real-life incarnation.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Isn't it nice when problems can be solved with violence?
    ```

  - u/Escapement:

    I had the exact same reaction. 

    I've tried to analyze my own reaction, and I think in my personal case it possibly boils down to tribalism and near-far perspective stuff - I see a lot Singer's effective altruism stuff as benefiting people unrelated to me, those foreign to me who are not part of my 'tribe', while the destruction of Hell I view as benefiting me and my 'tribe'. Plus the goal seems somehow more concrete & achievable. Plus of course the tendency to love a martyr. However, the first bit is probably what persuaded my emotional reaction the most. That's just me, though.
    ```

    - u/Sparkwitch:
      ```
      Destruction is not just easier than construction, it's easier than maintenance:

      Hell is something which *can* be defeated. It's a standing edifice, ready to be torn down. It would likely collapse on its own without constant influxes of time, effort, and energy.

      Starvation (to pick one of our real Singer's sources of suffering) happens through a *lack* of time, effort, or energy. It would require all of those, in perpetuity, to prevent starvation entirely.

      Removing a wicked edifice is always easier than establishing a virtuous one. Not only is the construction expensive, the result is often less effective than advertised, or less efficient, or even ultimately counter-productive. Genuine virtuous edifice are so rare that most effective altruism doesn't take them seriously, and goes after lower hanging fruit instead: Saving individual lives, one bed-net at a time.

      Genuine wicked edifice? Also more nuanced than Hell, and possessed of better funded Public Relations departments. They're still more popular as rhetorical targets (Big Tobacco, Big Oil, The Media, Communism) because destroying them sounds like a winnable fight. It has an easily conceivable end.

      Fights against suffering are, by and large, eternal.

  So how powerful is Thamiel? One would think he would be on the level of an arch-angel like Uriel, but he needed to put a price on Singer's head in order to have him killed. Even if he couldn't smite PS, you'd think he could dispatch some agents to kill him in some more demonic way than a car bomb. Furthermore, Hell could apparently be laid siege to.

  On the other hand, we don't know how powerful the Comet King is to be able to threaten Hell, and the fact that it seems to literally have billions of tortured souls suggests other biblical facts about it and its ruler may be accurate.
  ```

  - u/callmebrotherg:
    ```
    Thamiel's activities on Earth could also be restricted in some way, requiring the use of intermediaries.
    ```

    - u/LiteralHeadCannon:
      ```
      What if there's a Prohibitive Name?  Something you can use to ban individual others from using any names, and which has obviously been used on Thamiel.
      ```

      - u/callmebrotherg:
        ```
        Perhaps, but since angels can't use names, I doubt that the Devil can either.
        ```

        - u/LiteralHeadCannon:
          ```
          Oh.  That's, um, something I forgot.
          ```

      - u/gwern:
        ```
        If Thamiel couldn't go to earth, where was he holding the summit with the President? Surely the President wouldn't go to Hell.
        ```

        - u/callmebrotherg:
          ```
          I didn't say that he can't go to Earth, but that his activities there are restricted (e.g. Thamiel can visit, but he can't directly wield power beyond some particular limit).
          ```

        - u/philh:
          ```
          At least not while alive.
          ```

- u/dalitt:
  ```
  This is incredibly good.
  ```

- u/Frommerman:
  ```
  I love making this argument with theists when I put on my angry atheist hat. I like Unsong!Singer.
  ```

- u/psychothumbs:
  ```
  So hell and angels are things that people in this world have physical proof of and can directly interact with. But god apparently is not around, to the extent that people think he may not be a 'personal' type god at all? Very interesting.
  ```

- u/psychothumbs:
  ```
  This story is so great.
  ```
