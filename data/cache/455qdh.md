  Wow, I'm flattered! There was actually a past thread [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3yf55g/rtrst_scifihorror_novel_eden_green/), where I asked about whether it qualifies as 'rational' fiction (consensus was yes). I can't wait to see the new discussions that take place here!

  If any rationalists would like a free ebook copy or an Audible code, please PM me and mention this thread. There's a print version coming soon; if you'd rather wait until you can buy that, I have a newsletter on the above page where you can sign up for ~monthly updates.

  If anyone here already read it and enjoyed it, I'd really *really* appreciate it if you posted a review on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26058753-eden-green) and/or [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B010ON836U/)! 

  AMA about the book, writing, tropes, self-publishing, etc!

    Just letting you know, I posted a review on Amazon.

    > I bought the book about three hours ago and I'm now writing a review after finishing it.

    > It's an extremely fast-paced book and while I initially thought it would be too short at ~150 pages, it turned out to be the equivalent of a 500 page novel packed into a shorter book. I was sucked in by the interactions between the characters from the very first pages and I felt rage, sympathy, love, and disgust for each of the three main characters at different points of the story. Unusually, I learned more about the characters through how the others' reactions rather through the behaviors of the people themselves. I suspect it's due to how insane and bizarre their situations are that I was swept up in the flow of the story and couldn't take the time to consider my own reactions. To me, they are real deeply flawed people.

    > As a warning, there are fairly gory scenes, but the real horrifying parts of the book are the descriptions of mental trauma. Fiona has managed to make being insane, amnesic, or sociopathic viscerally terrifying instead of being a clinical concern associated with the diagnosis of a mental disorder.

    > Favorite parts are when Eden is striving to learn all she can about what is happening to her and using logical reasoning to work around her questionable emotional stability. Worse parts is how the story is so intensely focused on these three people. Despite an event with world-wide consequences, there is very little interaction with other people (two scenes). But that's a manner of personal preference.

    > Now if only I could figure out what Veronica's secret is!

    Now for a quick review tailored for this subreddit.

    I'm mildly annoyed at how good the story was. I only meant to read a chapter or two, but I got sucked in and couldn't stop to do work. I'll definitely buy any sequels. Eden does act rational for the most part, the difficulty is that her goals change very rapidly at certain parts of the story, so it may seem mildly irrational when her quick decisions are giving the readers whiplash. I actually liked it though since part of rationality is making the best decisions when under pressure, particularly time pressure.

    Hands down, this story redefines rational horror.

    By the way, what was Veronica's secret? I know it should be very obvious, but I'm very uncertain about my guess. [Is she](#s " transexual or something similar?")

    Thanks for the story!

        Ah, thanks for the confirmation.

    I read this. It was good. I especially liked the ending. :)

    Like, *really* liked it. It was a breath of fresh air.

    [](#s "I did not like the Kazuma/Eden moments. Fffffffffffuck I hate Kazuma, no matter how pitiable he is he's incorrigibly suspect. Though that's exactly what you were going for, wasn't it?")

    [](#s "Ron's treatment could have been a little more circumspect. The hints got really unsubtle.")

    [](#s "Good job representing the mental effects of shock and trauma.")

      ```
      [](#s "I get that 'grr why doesn't Tedrin die in a fire on page 15' reaction a lot. He, and in a more mundane way, Veronica, represent ways the non-rational world can screw with Eden. Thanks to them, she meets with failures and horrible suffering despite usually taking a rational approach.")

      I'm going to add to my post above, but: If you enjoyed the book, I'd really *really* appreciate it if you posted a review on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26058753-eden-green) and/or [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B010ON836U/)!

        I've never reviewed on Amazon before, but I'll definitely do that.

    After writing a book, how do you get the word out?  

    What process of reasoning led to you deciding to publish by yourself?
    ```

    - u/FekketCantenel:

      I'll answer those out of order, since one flows from the other.

      > What process of reasoning led to you deciding to publish by yourself?

      I spent a few months in the agent query game, sending samples and letters and summaries to probably 50 agents total. ([QueryTracker](https://querytracker.net/) was indispensable.) All I got back was radio silence, form rejections, and two interested parties who eventually decided they weren't interested.

      And I completely get it; any who open themselves to unsolicited queries are absolutely *spoiled* for choice. There must be loads of much more marketable books coming across their desks every day.

      However, based on the reader responses I've gotten (before and after publishing, from friend and stranger alike), I know my work has an audience. I'm extremely lucky to live in a time when self-publishing is not only possible, but very cheap and even easy. I've been a proofreader/copy-editor for years and know some great people in that industry (hi [Yvonne](http://helpedit.com/)!).

      If you're ever interested in self-publishing your own work, I encourage you to check out [Help Edit](http://helpedit.com/) (run in part by the above-mentioned Yvonne) and /r/selfpublish. Between them, you can get everything you need to put out your work.

      > After writing a book, how do you get the word out?

      First of all, let go of the idea of having amazing career success with just one book. Of course, every book is your baby, and you should make sure it's good and pound the pavement finding readers for it. But from everything I've seen, no one so much as *breaks even* before their third or fourth published book. Start now, taking small steps every day (write 1666 words, proofread a chapter, move forward on publishing, send a copy to a new reviewer, etc.).

      Also, while we're at it, let go of the idea of the first novel you write being the first one you publish. Loads of people do that and still find success, but in my experience, it takes a few novels before you really learn how to put together a good story and what mistakes to avoid (both plot-wise and in your writing routine). *Eden Green* is the tenth novel I ever wrote, and the first one I felt was ready for a big audience.

      Speaking of which, always keep this question in mind: 'Who is the audience for this book?' In my case, it's rationalist tropers who like internet humor and female protagonists. (This thread has been an utter delight so far.) Whatever choices you make in promotion, always keep that audience in mind. Make a list of books you like that are similar to the one you self-publish, and seek out those readers.

      *Eden Green* has only been out for only seven months, so I'm advising based on limited experience. However, here are the top three things that have brought me new readers:

      1. Make sure your book has a TVTropes page. I put this off for a long time, hoping someone else would do it for me, but (even according to their own rules) it's perfectly fine to create and add to it yourself. Start out with the description and a few obvious tropes, then go in every day and add more until you literally can't find any more tropes that fit. Then (I'm at this step now) go through every day and add your book to five of those tropes' pages, so they cross-reference. This is how tropers will find your book.
      2. [Put the book is on Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/author/program) and become active there (review books you like, participate in interesting group threads, etc.). Once you've established a presence, message reviewers who have liked similar books and offer them a free ebook copy of yours. (Goodreads discourages this, but I haven't seen any blowback yet.)
      3. Tell people IRL about it! Have something ready that you can hand to them if they're interested, like a bookmark or business card with the cover, a plot teaser, and shortlinks to where they can find it.

      I also recommend ACX, the service through which anyone can put an audiobook on Audible. I recorded my own at home, and while it was a full-time job making sure the audio quality and editing were up to standard, it was *so* worth it for the extra income stream and the ability to say I have an audiobook version. You can also hire narrators through ACX and even pay nothing up front, instead granting them 50% of royalties.

      If anyone has any further questions about self-publishing, please let me know!

    Whoops! I don't know how I missed it, because even if I had decided not to buy it yet, I would have at least added it to my wishlist.

  I was poking around in the [Rational Fiction](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RationalFic) section of TV Tropes and found this story which hasn't been mentioned on this subreddit before.

  I haven't read the story yet, but it sounds good enough to try recommending.

  The author's also a redditer by the name of /u/FekketCantenel.
