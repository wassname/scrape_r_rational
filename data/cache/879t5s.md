## [D] Monday General Rationality Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics!  Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world?  Have you:

* Seen something interesting on /r/science?
* Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
* Figured out how to become immortal?
* Constructed artificial general intelligence?
* Read a neat nonfiction book?
* Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?

  I sometimes check out topwebfiction just to see if anything new catches my eye. I noticed a new series (new to me, at least) has taken the number 2 spot: ["Small Worlds"](http://webfictionguide.com/listings/small-worlds/) by Alex Raizman. Apparently it's only been up since March 15th, but I'm a bit surprised it has so many votes. The author says he regularly posts to /r/writingprompts, so maybe that explains it?

  Anyway, before investing time into that, or its follow-up ["Strange Cosmology"](http://webfictionguide.com/listings/strange-cosmology/) (currently number 18 on the site), I was wondering if anyone else had read them yet, if they were recommended, and if they were rational?

    Just a follow-up; I decided to give Small Worlds a shot. /u/Turniper hit it dead on as "popcorn reading;" it's quick and action-packed, and while it has hints of deeper themes to explore and threads to follow, it's rather shallow overall. This isn't necessarily a plot you need to think about and wonder what comes next, because "what comes next" will literally happen in the next chapter.

    Like /u/dalitt said, it definitely draws inspiration from American Gods and has some MiB influence too. I also felt echoes of Unsong; a lot of the gods alter reality by manipulating equations, which felt similar to the Word manipulations in Unsong. But overall I'd say the entire thing felt like a superhero story where the heroes are gods. 

    Definitely not a rational story, though. *Everything* happens because the plot requires it - or at least, we don't get enough insight into seeing why characters act like they do to say otherwise. Rather than delving too deeply into the rules of the world, the most common catch-phrase is literally "just roll with it." That said there are some decent applications for solving fights, but they seem designed solely to show off a cool outcome. The characters themselves act in such a way that these moments feel railroaded to an extent. 

    Anyway, it was a quick read (I finished it in less than a day). I may read the sequel, as the story stopped without remotely resolving the main plot, but only because I don't have anything else to read right now. I'd give it a 5/10, maybe a 5.5/10 because the dangling threads make me a bit curious as to where it'll go.

    Thanks to the two posters for chiming in!

      Lol, np. If you have questions about anything on TWF, ask me, I've either read or started then dropped about 25 of the top 30 on there.

      If you read the sequel, I'd be curious to know what you think.

    I read "Small Worlds."  It was alright; clearly inspired by American Gods, with a hint of Men in Black.  Nothing too exciting.  There are a couple very cool moments, though.

    I finished small worlds and caught up on the sequel in a day. Nothing to write home about, but good popcorn reading if you're looking for something light.
