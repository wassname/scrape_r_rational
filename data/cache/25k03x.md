## [D] Thoughts on the anime Log Horizon?

### Post:

Log Horizon's about people who get trapped in an MMO world, the distinction being that it's actually still an MMO with many of the same rules, such as reviving from death and abilities having cooldowns and players having a personal UI to access items and spells.

In other words it's not just "Modern people in a fantasy world," and it does a lot of interesting things with the premise beyond what other "trapped in a video game anime" have done.  I've enjoyed it more than I thought I would, and kept feeling like it was skirting around the edges of being a rationalist fiction. 

The first season has its flaws: there was a bit too much tell and not enough show, the villains so far seem a bit one dimensional, and on a personal note I'm not a fan of the "super-kawaii" style of anime that certain characters kept slipping into (also, seen one male character obsessed with panties, seen them all).

But the main character is very cerebral, and there's lots of munchkinery. I feel like it has a lot of potential in the later seasons.

For those curious, the whole anime is available on crunchyroll.com.  Has anyone else here seen it, and if so what do you think?

[As a preemptive aside, the next Pokemon chapter should be done by this weekend :)]

  It started well, went down the drama uber alles road pretty fast.

  Aside from that, keep in mind it's an adaptation from a novel, and from what I've read it seems that the anime has been rushed quite a lot, and a few things have also been censored (quite important as well, like the whole backstory of the girl in the last episode), so as always to have the whole story it's necessary to read the original material, not the adaptation.

    Heh yeah, I was okay with that for the most part because it was clarifying how THIS MMO works and answering some of the questions I had about the mechanics.

    That said, I almost skipped through the one episode where they go over how a party functions role by role. That was painful.

  I watched while it was airing, and while I greatly enjoyed most of it the last few episode veered deep into Haremia and sucked the soul out. Still a fine watch, but it's not a must.

    Agreed, the season ending was very weak.  They seemed to have nipped the harem thing in the bud at first, by addressing the young girl's feelings for Shiro, but then they introduced the new villainess who seems to be fixated on him, which was disappointing. 

    I'm hoping the next season's focus sidelines that as much as possible in favor of exploring the whole Player Nation vs Player Nation concept, which has a lot of promise.
