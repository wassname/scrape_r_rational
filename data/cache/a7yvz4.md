  Very nice chapter, finally found time to catch up. I really enjoy the story so far. Its getting way more fluid, but i am also very interested what implications telepathy will have on the general students university lifestyle. Will normal tests still be effective ? I see some sort of challenges ahead... are there materials to inhibit telepathy? etc..

    Really most people who follow this kind of stuff are good as long as you keep updating. I know I am! It's really exciting seeing each new development in the story, and this chapter certainly introduced a couple of doozies.

      Edit: Spoke too soon! Great chapter!

        Thank you! I'm glad the slow updates aren't too bad. I keep telling myself that the important thing is that it gets written.
