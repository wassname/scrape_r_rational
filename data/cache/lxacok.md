## Ghostbusters: Afterlife

### Post:

So what I always thought was a missed opportunity in the Ghostbusters franchise and pretty much any work where ghosts exist like Bleach or Danny Phantom is never addressing the theological implications of ghosts. If the Ghostbusters put something like Slimer on an exhibit, how would religious individuals and institutions handle the fact that they were wrong?

  ```
  First off, Ghostbusters is a comedy about a group of exterminators whose 'pests' just happen to be ghosts.  Funny it is, rational, it isn't.

  Second off, they actually kind of do mention that in the movies, as there is at least one scene where they are listening to the radio or TV commentary about how some religious people are questioning whether it is the "End Times" or not.

  Thirdly, assuming they put Slimer's ugly green mug on exhibit, it wouldn't contradict or 'prove wrong' any of the religious institutions.  It doesn't prove or disprove anything, it just shows there's a green ghost-like creature that likes to eat everything in sight and leave slime all over the place.  Nobody is really proven wrong.

    If anything, the courtroom scene from Ghostbusters II would be much more alarming, as the ghosts that erupted (the 'Scoleri Brothers') were recognizable as individual people that had been convicted in that courtroom and later executed. Even then, they could simply use the "Hell is full" or "The End Times are nigh!" approach to explain it.

    Or just "Some ghosts look like people who died. Doesn't mean they *are* those people."

      "Demons can appear in the guise of dead humans" has been a belief among Christians for a long time (this is one reason why Hamlet doesn't just kill the king as soon as his dead dad explains the situationâ€”it might not be his dad!)

  ```
  Many religious folk already believe in demons. The idea that some of them finally decided to not work subtly and instead just try a new scheme where they pretend to be dead people with the news that there is no heaven or hell or whatever.

  ```
  It seems like the existence of ghosts would confirm a lot more religious viewpoints over secular ones. The real question is what secular philosophers are doing to adapt.
