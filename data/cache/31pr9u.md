## The Golden Coin

### Post:

You are given a magical golden coin. This coin has a range of 3 meters, within which probability functions exactly as the people inside the range would expect it to.

Let's expand on this idea a bit. The probability of a given event occurring within the range of the coin is the average of the probabilities of said event occurring as provided by the expectations of the people within the range. The natural most probable outcome counts as a single additional person towards this calculation.

If three people are within range, and one of them assigns a 100% probability to a house of cards falling down in the next minute, and the two others assign 50% probability, and the actual chance is 100%, there will be a 75% chance of the cards dropping in the next minute.

The coin can only influence events within the three meter range. It also can only influence probability, not physics. Even if you find someone who's willing to believe 100% that you're a god the coin won't make you 33% god, because it can't.

The question is this: How do you utilize the coin once you acquire it? Do you go to Vegas and hire a hypnotist to brainwash you into winning slot machines 6 times out of 10?

  What *doesn't* the coin know, that it has probabilities that you call the actual chance?  

  For example, let's say that I have a coin-flipping program on my computer run by a pseudorandom number generator (like a lot of computer programs are).  When I look at the screen and click the button, I predict a 50% chance of heads and a 50% chance of tails.  When a competent computer programmer looks at the code and current state of the computer, they can have (theoretically) 100% confidence of the outcome.  

  Me (50% heads), the programmer (0% heads), and the coin (???) are next to the computer.  What is the true probability?

  Or perhaps a better example:  Someone flips a coin onto a table, sees that it landed on heads, then covers it with his hand.  I open my eyes and predict a 50% chance that it will be heads when he takes his hand away, he predicts a 100% chance, and the coin (presumably) predicts a 100% chance of heads.  Would that make a 83% chance of it still being heads when he takes his hand away?

  Edit to add:  Who gets to ask the questions?  In my last example "what will be facing up when he takes his hand away?" returns different behavior than "will the coin flip itself while under his hand?"

  How could it possibly alter the outcome of physical events with its magic without altering physics?

  Also, how do you define the "actual" chance?  As ulyssessword pointed out probabilities are not properties of things, but rather states of partial information about things (I'm paraphrasing [Yudkowsky](http://lesswrong.com/lw/oj/probability_is_in_the_mind/) here).

  No, you become a three-meter-radius God.

  Can you make appear a lamp with Genie?

  Can you feed an RNG into an assembler file to do very stupid experiments trying to make an FAI?

  Can you make more coins?

  Can you start warping space around the coin to include more and more of the universe in its 3-meter-radius?

  Is there some sanity rule that prevents all the gazillion probabilistic events that nobody talks about from blowing up the universe in the way you'd expect when you start messing around with the ones and zeros in the universe simulators's RAM?

  I assume you are trying to say that the coin can only alter the probability of plausible outcomes, not add additional outcomes that are implausible.

  In other words, if you go to a casino, you aren't going to be able to use the coin to make tarot cards show up in a standard deck, but despite altering physics, your coin can make different cards appear in different orders to give you good hands.

  It stands to reason that you are going to need an irrational person to work with you to have any benefit.  A rational person will probably not be very useful, unless they are legitimately ignorant about the events you are trying to influence.  It's somewhat likely that a rational person will puzzle out more realistic odds than an irrational person though, making them less useful.

  This generates a situation where it's most rational to work with an irrational person.

  Recruit a gambling addict and start buying high dollar scratchoff lottery tickets.  Gambling addicts are gambling addicts because they think they can win.  The more they win with you, the more they think they will win.  With scratch off cards, even if you know the odds, the gambler doesn't.  Not really.  So you know the chance is somewhere around zero, the reality is somewhere around zero, but in the gambler's mind, it's much, much higher than that.  Average of zero + zero + ludicrous probability = ludicrous probability.

  EDIT - After you prove to yourself that the coin works, the odds of winning would jump significantly, because your expectation of winning would go up.

  ANOTHER EDIT - You can reinforce your gambling partner's dependence on you by simply letting them see what happens when you (and your coin) walk away from them.  YOU know this will work.  Once they see that their chances of winning drop when you aren't there, they will lock into you as their luck.  That's when you go to Vegas and sit at high dollar slots.  Be nice though, set them up a trust fund after you both have enough to retire, because they are never going to stop after you do this to them.  You're probably going to have to fake your own death or something to get them to leave you alone.

  Write a computer program that accepts text input and outputs random text data, ala "Infinite Monkeys on a typewriter"

  Use hypnotist to convince me that the program is actually a specific type of mechanical genie, which can output instructions for how to build or do anything I ask of it by request.

  Ask for next week's lotto numbers, than how to get big returns on the stock market, to get a large monetary base.

  Then get- Anything really. Cold Fusion plans? Done. Protein folding problem? Solved. 

  Complete laws of physics? Eat your heart out, Einstein.
