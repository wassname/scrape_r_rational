  OH. MY. GOD. It's alive! Now excuse me I'm gonna run in circles screaming in delight for a couple minutes.

    Literally beat me to those first 3 words.  I'm so damn psyched!

        Really? Monthly? Could have sworn it was more than that between the last few chapters.

          Probably nominally (or aspirationally) monthly rather than *actually* monthly. The chapter prior to this one was June 29th, and the one before that was December 1st of last year. There's not enough to develop a trendline at this point, and I'm not quite ready to call this fic back on a proper schedule yet.

  I love how Hannah doesn't even bat an eye at Milo going catatonic for 20 minutes. For her it's just Milo being Milo as usual.
  ```

    ```
    Gotta take those 20s
    ```

- u/ArisKatsaris:
  ```
  There's a blatant continuity error in this latest chapter. Fiona had already read about Sirius and his lack of a trial back in ch.69.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    You're right, and she didn't get obliviated in the meantime. I guess /u/SirPoley could've forgotten about it.
    ```

  ```
  I assume this was semiauto, and haven't read the chapter yet, but I assume this was intended to be "SD 21" in both the submission and chapter number as opposed to 212.

  Praise Azathoth, Yogsothoth, and all the outer gods in-between!
