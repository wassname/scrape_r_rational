  "...and then I'm going to consult with Hermoine on something I'm going to do." *oh shit*

  I am reminded of phrases from some remarkably iron-willed characters from someplace else entirely: "The situation as it stands is untenable." and "Don't do that, because then I'll have to kill you, and then you'll be dead."
  ```

  - u/endtime:
    ```
    I think it's a reference to his Vow from MoR.  IIRC he had to check with Hermione if he wasn't sure whether some course of action would endanger the world, or something like that.
    ```
