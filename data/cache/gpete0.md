## [META] Web Fiction Guide not dead after all

### Post:

Just heard about this.  [https://forums.webfictionguide.com/t/new-site-development/7479](https://forums.webfictionguide.com/t/new-site-development/7479).  There's still a good deal of work to be done, but by and by WFG will have a new administrator and, with luck, new entries will start flowing into TWF.  This is wonderful news; I thought it was hopeless.  Three cheers for Rocode.

  Awesome, I've been hoping this site gets faceted searches for a while now, hopefully it's on the list.

    I think there's a whole lot of things on the list.  Just semi-automated listings like they're talking about would be a huge improvement.

    This is great news!  I thought I'd missed the boat and that WFG was in dire straits.  I'll post there as soon as submissions open again.
