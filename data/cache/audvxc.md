## Recommendation: the Beginners Guide to Magical Licensing

### Post:

Off the bat I'd say this isn't a rational story. I can think of a couple of bizarre decisions / discrepancies in the protagonists behaviour. 

But I think this story will appeal to people here. It's abut a corporate mage who discovers a new and potentially lucrative magical technique; and his battle with entrenched monopoly interests who're willing to play very dirty.

  Sounds kinda like *Unsong* but less Jewish. (That's not particularly a criticism; fantasy books keep ripping each other off, on purpose or not on purpose, depending.)
