  This article sort of reminded me of something else: Zalgo Jenkins wrote [a neat little thread about the narrative structure of Dan Brown's fiction](http://forums.nrvnqsr.com/showthread.php/4821-Notes-on-Plotting-Grail-Wars-a-k-a-If-Dan-Brown-had-written-Fate-Stay-Night). It's ostensibly written to try to apply it to Fate/Stay Night fanfic, but I found it remarkable how regularly and thoroughly Brown had everything in his books set into patterns, and also how thoroughly Jenkins deconstructed and analyzed how the format of the book (pacing, high-level structure, etc) worked. 

  note: [Jenkins' FF.net profile](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/3726889/Zalgo-Jenkins); He is probably most known for Postnuptial Disagreements, a F/SN and Sekirei cross that was actually readable and interesting; the biggest improvement Jenkins made compared to others trying that crossover (esp. In Flight) is that he got the pacing and structure very *right* - 88k words tells a full and complete and satisfying story quite easily when used correctly.

    You should submit those links separately sometime; they seem to have the quality to deserve more attention that they'll receive in this comments section.

      The first link has basically nothing to do with the /r/rational subreddit, and the second is mostly a rec for a story where most factions are driven by irrational motives and which is not particularly rational in any real sense IMO. 

      For that matter, I personally wouldn't have linked the parent article to this sub. The observations are facile, and what substance there was would be way more suited to /r/writing or some other similar sub.

  *ASOIAF* is some really good hard fantasy, but not always appreciated as such. It definitely fits the characteristics of rational fiction, and there's something about it that's just so â€¦ *historical*, it doesn't even really feel much like fiction. GRRM is a truly masterful writer.

  He just needs to do it faster.

    Are you and I defining hard fantasy in different ways? To me, the fact that almost all the magic in the world of *ASOIAF* is completely unexplained means that it can't be hard fantasy. I'd agree that the characters actions are presented well, and I never think that anyone is doing something just for the sake of plot, but the magic ...

    There are about a dozen different types of magic within the world, and we only have vague rules for two or three of them. There's plenty of completely inexplicable magic happening all over the place. I would classify *ASOIAF* as more low fantasy.

      Interesting that you say none of the characters do things just for the sake of plot. When I read the books, I couldn't look past Catelyn Stark. Everything she did seemed to be for the sake of plot. Sure, I understand that she was a worried mother, but it seemed to me at least that all her decisions happened to be bad in the best way to advance the plot. I didn't feel as if her back story adequately explained them/made me expect those actions, even in a retroactive aha way.

      I assume some of the historical feeling comes from the fact that it is loosely based on the war of the roses. But I don't know enough of that history to say how much it is based on it.

  > "I cannot think of such disruptive change to story telling technique without going back to the middle ages".

  Now all I'd like to say is that this has been done before, just not successfully, nor so mainstream.

  >He's the protagonist! He just cannot die like this in the middle of the story! Ridiculous! What's the next season going to be about?

  I'd also like to say that ASOIAF never really had a single Protagonist, and that's what most stories that kill off a main character are like, they either have a secondary character who is telling the story of the protagonist (who then dies half way through or something). In GoT there were a ton of chapters from other perspective.

  It kind of defeats the whole "omg this is so unique he killed off the protagonist no one has done that before" when the whole point that makes that surprising is the lack of someone else to take up the mantle. 

  So yeah, the whole premise of this article is wrong, this isn't unique and GRRM certainly didn't invent it, though it's an interesting method of story telling. (Edit: When I started with this comment I did assume there would be more substance to the article than just praising GRRM for his uniqueness)

    Can you list some examples?

      *Legend of the Galactic Heroes*, for one.
