## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  The superhero genre is about as irrational as they come. The nearly universal premise is a person discovers they have abilities beyond what a normal person does, so they put on a mask to fight crime and help people as they choose while still living a normal life. In reality, this is not an efficient use of their abilities, nor is it particularly effective at fulfilling their goals on a macro scale.

  However, one thing rational fiction authors need to understand about these genre conventions before they play with them is why they exist. When people see someone notice injustice and use the power they have to fight it, it inspires the audience to do the same. Superheroes are fundamentally just good samaritans, and therein lies the basic reason people get emotionally invested in superhero stories.

  Seemingly a good way to compromise would be for the hero's job to to be helping others, such as a police officer, firefighter, or paramedic. However, this risks denying the central conceit of a heroic protagonist: autonomy. People recognize heroism when the protagonist chooses to help when they don't have to. When you institutionalize heroism, it risks taking the inspiration away.

  I'm not critiquing any story or setting in particular, The Metropolitan Man was most certainly not a superhero story and I thought Worm actually stuck too closely to superhero conventions given the setting. I just think it's important to understand why people like irrational stories before you write rational fiction.

  Note: I have not yet read Strong Female Protagonist.

    There are different ways to write rational fiction.

    You can take a reconstructionist approach, where you see this trope (or genre) that people like and try to have it make sense somehow -- that's completely valid. But you can also take the deconstructionist approach and tear down a trope (or genre) to expose its weak points.

    I think superheroes-fighting-petty-crime is generally a bad trope. It gives people warm fuzzies, sure, and *maybe* inspires them toward being good (more likely, it short-circuits the altruistic reward pathways in the brain), but it's ultimately a model of charity that exaggerates all of the worst aspects of charity-as-warm-fuzzies or charity-as-signaling. It's ineffective altruism. One of the things that people like about rational fiction is that it's willing to examine things like that. There's a connection between Superman pulling a kitten down from a tree and slacktivist culture that you don't often see pointed out; to my mind that's one of the reasons that rational fiction exists. (And yes, you still need to make a satisfying story, but you can do that without doing a reconstruction.)

    An interesting proposal I've heard for the strange behavior of super-heroes is that it is driven by a system similar to Mantling from TES, or Archetypes from Unknown Armies. Essentially, there are timeless prototypes that exist in the universe, which allow for an actor with the right qualities, following the right script, to do things that are otherwise impossible (with escalating levels of impossibility for a more complete replication of the prototype).
    ```

    - u/Iconochasm:
      ```
      That's essentially the secondary magic system in Practical Guide to Evil.  Certain tropes played out so many times in-universe that they took on ontological weight of their own, resulting in a massive difference between an incompetent mage as opposed to *The* Bumbling Conjurer.

      *Strong Female Protagonist* has the simpler excuse that people are easily influenced by the media, so people with powers become superheroes because that's what they think you're supposed to do when you get powers. That state of affairs only lasts for a few years, until the relative shortage of supervillains forces people to rethink their assumptions.
      ```

      - u/trekie140:
        ```
        I was under the assumption that the setting treated superheroes as a transitional state. There was a need for heroes and people answered the call, but the state of affairs changed so they didn't need to rely on good samaritans anymore. What I know for sure is the characters acknowledge that putting on masks to fight crime was a good idea at the time, it just wasn't the fix-all solution that they thought it would be.
        ```

      - u/Aabcehmu112358:
        ```
        Yeah, but that doesn't have the added benefit of also shedding light on the structure underlying superpowers.
        ```

    - u/scruiser:
      ```
      That sounds like an even more overly precise excuse for superheroes and supervillains than what Worm has, but it does avoid some of the possible implied grimdarkness of the circumstances that force a balance of superheroes and supervillains (which Worm fully embraced).
      ```

      - u/Aabcehmu112358:
        ```
        I mean, those two examples arose entirely independent of the superhero genre, and even in the real world there are lot of various religious or semi-religious practices intended to imitate mythic characters and thus replicate their feats, so I hardly think the idea comes out of left-field.

        A way to make it feel less excuse-y, I guess, would be have there be more than just 'hero' and 'villain' templates, and to remember that, besides people who are possibly insane, a character is different from the ideal they're replicating. Which conveniently also sets up some conflict over choosing to sacrifice the power or to make compromise.
        ```

          > two examples arose entirely independent of the superhero genre

          > would be have there be more than just 'hero' and 'villain' templates

          ...now that I think about it, it would probably be pretty easy to justify a general magic system which in particular made superheroes and supervillains.  Something like Pact, where precedent and tradition have power in and of themselves.

          > Which conveniently also sets up some conflict over choosing to sacrifice the power or to make compromise.

          That sets up an interesting choice... working for the government or using a power for maximum efficiency resulting in a loss of power would be a important conflict.  Once the government starts to catch on to how templates work, it would be a trade-off between PR to the general public, having efficient heroes, having powerful heroes and dealing with all the general government stuff like bureaucracy, tax dollars, and corruption.
          ```

            Figuring out what collection of templates make for a particularly interesting story seems like an interesting challenge. Would it be good to have the templates have a theme running through them, or would it be better to have them be alien to one another?
            ```

            - u/scruiser:
              ```
              You could design the rules behind your templates, and then let the history and mythology of your setting dictate the rest, or you could plan out what story you want to tell and then fill out the templates you need, plus a few more to make things interesting.

  So something I've been thinking about recently is how you could plausibly keep something like the Harry Potter verse hidden. I don't think the Obliviators portrayed in the books be nearly enough. That kind of localized mind magic would always have problems with missed people convincing a large number of others.

  On the other hand, this is clearly a universe with anti-memes in the style of SCP (forgive me I forget exactly what they called those things). Many charms work on this principle most notably the  Fidelius Charm ignoring for the moment that it isn't used nearly as often as it ought to be given it's properties.

  There's also the other side of things which is the massive lack of culture flow form the muggle world to wizards. Yea I get that they're separated but there ought to be more flow. Somebody who's studying them should have a basic understanding at least. The only way you end up with something like we see in the books is with spell work. Something's prevent the worlds mixing. If I were to guess something related to the Fidelius Charm preventing muggles from learning of the existence of wizards and preventing wizards learning much about muggles and also possibly giving them a level of protection. The amount of crime aimed at muggles given wizards can wipe memories again seems unreasonably low.
  ```

    A Masquerade is comparatively natural when the magic world is physically separate from the real one. Perhaps like a parallel universe. And magic people don't commonly come and go between worlds, so their presence is fairly easy to hide, particularly if they need some sort of travel visa so the magic government knows what they need to cover up.

    I thought Harry Potter was going in this direction at first, with places like Platform 9 3/4 and Diagon Alley and Hogwarts being completely inaccessible to Muggles, but it eventually gave up on that.
    ```

  - u/trekie140:

    Agreed, the setting doesn't make much sense when you look at it too hard. The only justification I can come up with is that the whole series is told from Harry's perspective, and he isn't exactly the brightest kid. We're just hearing what he's learned from personal experience since he never bothered to study the wizarding world.

    The Masquerade is such a common trope, however, that I'd love to find a way of having it make sense. How can you possibly keep an entire world a secret right under the public's nose, let alone keep it up forever? The SCP Foundation uses the trope as Fridge Horror when we discover reality is a lie created by , but that isn't applicable to every story.

    The only solution I have for when you don't want to fall back on conspiracy, is to throw out the idea of objective reality in your setting. Make the supernatural real, but impossible to objectively prove. Mental effects are the easiest to do with this, but Genius: The Transgression does a remarkable job of making the unscientific true.
    ```

    - u/rhaps0dy4:
      ```
      > Make the supernatural real, but impossible to objectively prove

      How can you do that? If you put the supernatural in the story, then it affects the story's world. Therefore in the story's world the supernatural is observable, so it is possible to prove.
      ```

      - u/scruiser:
        ```
        > How can you do that? If you put the supernatural in the story, then it affects the story's world. 

        I think he answered it.

        > throw out the idea of objective reality in your setting. 

        If you really throw out objective reality, then it could be that there isn't a single unified true state of the world, and there isn't a single true history and there isn't anything making one future more probable than another in an objective sense, and there definitely isn't a single unified model that can explain reality at all phenomenological levels.  Everyone's subjective probabilities are different.  The mundane reality is an island of stability, or rather meta-stability, it asserts itself because [insert whatever general metaphysical rule comes close to being true in the setting: mundane reality is mathematically simpler, mundane reality is commonly agreed upon, mundane reality is enforced by powerful supernatural entities, etc.].  For the average person, any evidence of the supernatural they could try to find will have more parsimonious mundane explanations because the very metaphysics of reality is enforcing such an apparent explanation.  Mages/wizard/witches/mad scientists are the few humans able to overcome this mechanic [depending on the setting by force of belief/will, contact with a higher power, ability to outsmart reality itself, etc.]
        ```

      - u/trekie140:
        ```
        A good example I've seen is the movie Oculus. The mirror can control people's perceptions and actions, so everyone thinks the victims are insane and they often agree. The entire film is about an attempt to prove the mirror is haunted, but it's intelligent enough to fight back. I don't normally like horror movies, but this one was terrifying and surprisingly rational.

        In Genius the reason mad science can't be proven is because the effects can't be replicated, showing them off to people turns them in to mad scientists or Igor-like creatures, and when the gadgets are examined they tend to explode. The central personal conflict of the setting, besides dealing with psychosis, is being torn between science and pseudoscience that works.

      Have you read Artemis fowl? I thought it was an interesting answer-- magic speeds up tech acquisition, so aside from all the magical tricks, they also get to beat mundane society at their own game.

    You don't have to worry about missing people you should have mindwiped so long as no one will believe them. There are people who say they've seen ghosts or angels, and I dismiss them pretty much on reflex. A fair number of those you missed will chalk what they saw up to being a fever dream or hallucination.

    Edit: I've actually got a story I'm (idly) working on where this is the case:

    > On the whole, the masquerade was surprisingly easy to maintain. The mind was a wonderful, complex thing, and one of the things that it was very good at was matching patterns. If something deviated from the pattern, the mind simply glossed over it. A gleaming sword became an aluminum bat. A unicorn became a horse. People would dismiss what they saw as a hallucination, a trick of the light, or a practical joke. Even if they had some hidden suspicions of the truth, and never fully fell for the pattern matches the brain offered up, the average brain was also very good at conformity. You didn’t mention the man with the wand, because you didn’t want the social stigma that came with that. There was nothing magical about any of this; that was simply how people were.

    >	Sometimes, in exceptional cases, the twin friends of pattern matching and conformity simply weren’t up to the job. And that was where the Department of Memory Management and Modification came in.

      That works most of the time, but personal cameras are becoming more and more common. The Dresden Files had to say magic disrupts electricity so cell phones don't work around it, but even that seems like it would become noticeable after a while. I want an explanation for The Masquerade that could last for the foreseeable future, instead of fall apart once technology has advanced enough.

        There really isn't one. People, technologies and institutions are getting better at collecting and analyzing data year after year, and people are getting increasingly connected.

        It mostly depends on the magic system and the masquerade scale (hiding a town of faeries basically just requires hypnotizing all outsiders into ignoring everything, controlling communications with the exterior, and a lot of accounting), and the effects of the masquerade. If it's "some people are somewhat stronger, faster and more attractive than average because they descend from Apollo", it's easy to hide because the most visible effects will be something like most Olympic medalists having Greek lineage. If the masquerade is about vampires going around killing people, keeping it secret is a lot harder because the existence of a cast of superhuman killers will leave traces, patterns in the murders, physical evidence, recordings, etc.

        It might be possible to hide it for some time, especially with mind control, memory altering and financial or administrative power. But there's not system that will give high odds of keeping the masquerade secret in a modern world for more than a few years.
        ```

        - u/space_fountain:
          ```
          My basic contention is that it requires large scale mind control. You can't get by on a case by case basis, you need something that completely eliminates certain knowledge. You want a situation where certain thoughts can't be had or at a minimum certain things can't be remembered. 

          Alternatively you can get by with a god like entity working on a case by case basis.

          Keep in mind the goal isn't to prevent all knowledge of something, just prevent the knowledge from becoming commonly known.
          ```

          - u/CouteauBleu:
            ```
            Sure. Personally, I've never liked masquerades, because they're always more of a writer's trick to say "Look, this takes place in reality, except you never realized it because it was kept secret!", than actually thought-out worldbuilding.

            Like, there's nothing unrealistic about keeping a secret. It happens all the time. But keeping a secret shared by thousands/millions of people, who might live among those they're supposed to hide from, for hundreds/thousands of years? It's hard, it's expensive, it's probably not going to work, and it'll create loads of problems when the bubble inevitably pops. It's almost never worth the handwavy benefits it's stated to have. And the way the masquerade forms is never clearly explained, and usually boils down to "And then people stopped believing in fairies even though the number of fairies remained exactly constant." A reductionist approach to "what would we do if we were people with these magical powers" gives something very different from "let's spend the next centuries in hiding!"
            ```

            - u/CCC_037:
              ```
              Of course, the really *brutal* way to enforce a Masquerade is to have a setting wherein, if the Masquerade gets broken, then *bad stuff happens*.

              One such setting is El Goonish Shive, where there exists a masquerade to hide the existence of magic - and, more importantly, to hide *how incredibly EASY it is to get magic* once you know it exists.

              And the reason for the Masquerade is that people who get magic wind up with spells that fit their personality. As one character puts it; who do you think will end up getting the *really* violent and destructive spells?

              --------------

              When the people maintaining the Masquerade can point at Pompeii and say "That's what happened the last time the mask slipped", then almost everyone has *really* good reason to work hard at keeping the secret.
              ```

              - u/Chronophilia:
                ```
                This hits an important point: If the Masquerade is a conspiracy (as opposed to a law of nature like in *Genius*), there must be some reason it was established in the first place. One which presumably holds true to the present day.
