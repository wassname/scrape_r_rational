## Short Story - Amazing Man

### Post:

[Amazing Man](http://www.deathisbadblog.com/amazing-man/)
I dashed off a little short story, inspired by the Sad Puppies Hugo Fiasco. I had fun writing it, I hope someone finds it enjoyable to read. I don't think it's Rational or Rationalist really, but it kinda waves in that direction in the few thousand words I had. For anyone who reads it... would it be approriate to post to http://rationalfiction.io/ ?

  Please leave politics out of the sub. This isn't rational or rationalist at all, it's political satire. This doesn't belong here.

  Proposed alternative title: The Adventures of Straw-Man.

  I don't see how. Did you seriously set out to write a rational protagonist, and end up with this?

  So, would you call him a Dork Lord?
