## Gamer stories? Comics?

### Post:

I really like the gamer stories! Any particularly good ones? Its not a problem if they are translated, fanfiction or comic/manga. Now that i think about it, i really haven't read any rational comics either.

  Do you mean litrpgs, isekais where the MC is transported to a game world, or stories involving VR gaming in the real world?

    They are probably talking about the [The Gamer](https://www.webtoons.com/en/action/the-gamer/list?title_no=88), a manhwa largely based in our world where the main character is the only one who has access to a game-like system, if I remember correctly. Fanfic crossovers with it are more popular than the original, as it's quite easy to think "But what if Frodo could spec into magic and just summon his own eagles?" and get to writing. The Erogamer has been mentioned numerous times on this sub, and that story is basically "What if The Gamer, but lewd (and better written)?"

  Solo Levelling >!Probably the closest to what you're looking for. Similar in nature to The Gamer in that you have a main character with video game powers in a world with non-levelling supernatural powers. Less whimsical, more gritty, death happens a fair bit. Korean web novel being converted into a manhwa.  I'd recommend reading the manwha first until you run out and then picking up from the web novel.!<

  "Greg Veder vs The World" >!is a The Gamer/Worm fusion fanfiction.  I haven't checked up on it in a while so I don't quite remember where it's at.  Main character has game type statistics but is not in a video game. Warning: Has a lot of the grittiness you'd expect from Worm.!<

  "The City and the Dungeon" by Mathew Schmidtt >!is a good audiobook. Set in the near future, main character has game type statstics but so do all "Delvers".!<

  "Dungeon Crawler Carl" >!used to be free on royal road, now the first book can be gotten from Amazon and I think the rest of the chapters are still available on Royal Road. Fantastic. Main character has game stats, and so do most others, but the nature of reality is a little bit uncertain. Each chapter has an afterword by the author where he chronicles his pug's valiant struggles against an army of clone infiltrators!<

  "Worth the Candle" >!is a high fantasy type story available on Royal Road and AOOO. Main character has stats and is working through what appears to be a fantasy world. Nature of reality is heavily uncertain.  Warning: Really heavy sometimes. Author chooses not to use content warnings.!<

  "Street Cultivation" >!Audiobook series. Low powered street-level fantasy. Technically everyone has stats- Everyone has access to ki and it can be quantified using a phone app.  I recommend it if you've got audiobook access but it's much more of an underdog story than the Deus Ex Machina stompfest that The Gamer tends to be.!<

    I’d HARD de-rec Solo Leveling. Now I’m less of the rational-seeking type of reader here, commonly delving into the trash piles of Japanese, Chinese, and English webnovels(and god forbid, sometimes even MTL!), and even then Solo Leveling was one of the worse ones I’ve read.

    After the MC gets his Gamer Power, his identity literally turns a complete 180, from a hardworking, average, and kind Korean teen to an aggressive mega-attractive Kpop star-looking asshole who responds to even the slightest provocation with death, all while acting very arrogant.

    It’s not wrong to say that he becomes the stereotypical Chinese webnovel protagonist, and that is NOT a good thing, given their propensity for violence, arrogance, and violence. He also really never uses his brain for any fights since his abilities are so broken, and then there’s the extreme nationalism and the treatment of Japan and America. After the shit Japan pulls they literally call him his savior, and both America and China are licking his boots.

    The ending was also quite a mess. The story is so unpolished that I wouldn’t recommend it to anybody on r/rational, and even on subs like r/noveltranslations I’d be very cautious about it. The only thing good about the series is the manhwa’s art.

    Worth the Candle and Dungeon Crawler Carl are fantastic though. WtC is praised enough on this sub, but I really appreciate what DCC does. I don’t really like how over the top comedy is blended into a lot of stories, especially ones as dark as DCC, but DCC does it perfectly. It fits so well with the dark story without ever feeling out of place or unnecessary, I’d even say it’s crucial to the atmosphere of the story, which I absolutely love. The writing is not a masterpiece but it’s my favorite in how it blends in the humor so perfectly. For a web novel, Carl is surprisingly rational too, arguably showing more smarts than you see from the typical game system MC. I really enjoy watching him try to break the limits of the system constantly for one benefit or another.

      My least favorite part about Solo Leveling is the fact that no one other than the MC can improve. Like what’s the point of training or practicing if you’re always stuck at the same rank regardless of what you do. Maybe this changes later, but I couldn’t get past more than 30 chapters. The world just seemed very poorly thought out.

        I mean thats kind of like saying why train with any tool since the tool never changes or gets better. I mean a specific tool, like "this hammer" vs "any hammer including sledge".

        How you use your abilities matters as much as what they are.

        My issue with solo leveling (dropped it early) was how most every antagonist is so eeEeEevillll they seem barely able to not skin every living thing around them.

          >	How you use your abilities matters as much as what they are.

          Sure, but whether this can actually make a meaningful difference really depends on the design of the world. If you have a world like Worm, this can work because powers are so varied in scope and application. There’s a lot of room for creative uses of ‘weak’ powers.

          But if you have fairly generic video game skills with limited scope (e.g. attacks deal poison, increased durability, etc.), this doesn’t really work. At some point, diminishing returns from practice means that you’ll reach the peak of what you can achieve with that skill.

          Also, to make a setting like this work, you pretty much need the MC to have a ‘weak’ skill that they use creatively. Or if they have have a strong skill, then there needs to be meaningful limitations or restrictions. Otherwise, it’s basically a power trip with very little that’s interesting in terms of plot. (Unless it’s a parody of some kind, but that’s a different discussion).

      The Solo Levelling *manhua* is great purely from a rule-of-cool spectacle sense. The plot and characters are pretty garbage, but it's sort of like complaining about the plot at a fireworks show. If the OP likes The Gamer they might even like the plot idk.

      I'm not sure I really get the degree of praise for DCC, having only read the free chapters. It's fun, and the occasional cleverness can be interesting, but it feels bogged down by just how much of the story is the setting being gratuitously dickish. Everything ends up revolving around that to the detriment of depth in almost any aspect of the story; what the characters do, how they do it, the humor, the NPCs, etc. WtC also has a fucked up setting, but it's also a lot more than just that, whereas it's plausibly half the word count of DCC.

        This is a common turnoff early but it plays into it well as it goes on. There is serious factionalism among the aliens along various lines and it blunts the sloggy "omnipotent asshole ROB" nature that it kind of has going at the start.

    Note that the whole thing is also available from Patreon https://www.patreon.com/dinniman for $3 / month.  That means you can get the entire story, first to last, for $3. You don't get the cute Toby bits (his pug, not part of the book proper) and there are tiny differences between the three versions (Patreon, Royal Road, Amazon) -- a sentence added, a typo fixed -- but nothing that matters.

    Also, the part that's on Amazon is in Kindle Unlimited, so you can read it free of you have a KU account.

    I strongly recommend this series. It's brilliantly written and incredibly engaging.

  The Gamer has been ridiculously popular for fanfiction crossovers, but they're almost all written for the "Wow, cool!" factor rather than being rational. 

  [Kill Them All](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/kill-them-all-worm-gamer.830187/reader/) is a Worm/Gamer crossover where Taylor gets the Gamer powers instead of her usual bug control. It's a train ride of escalation, bad teenage decision making and some actual character growth, and is complete. I wouldn't call it rational, but it was a fun read.

  [A Hardcore Game](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-hardcore-game-gamer-40k-si.846904/) has a Gamer character inserted into Warhammer 40K. The writing quality is not great, but the character makes reasonable decisions, faces actual consequences for his actions, and real threats.

  [Siren Song](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/siren-song-worm-x-the-gamer-oc.633613/reader/) is another Gamer/Worm cross. One of Heartbreaker's children from the original story gets the Gamer powers. This actually makes him more sane rather than less. He exploits the system reasonably well, experiments with it, weighs the pros and cons of various social decisions, it's sort of rational. Long but probably dead now.

  [A Daring Synthesis](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-daring-synthesis-worm-the-gamer.607375/reader/)
  Another Worm crossover. Spacebattles loves Worm. This one has a canon-correct Greg Veder. In other words, 100% cringe. One of the few Gamer crossovers that has mental stats actually affect personality. Greg grows into it. Painfully. It feels very realistic, and given Greg's low starting point, it's rational enough.

  [The Games We Play](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-games-we-play-rwby-the-gamer-ryuugi-complete.351105/) The most well known one on this list. A cross over with early RWBY, it's better viewed as injecting a Gamer into a completely original world, since so little of the canon worldbuilding was complete by the time this was finished.
  Its own worldbuilding is very good, the Gamer makes good use of his abilities, but it does start to feel like a treadmill of bigger enemies, bigger numbers. Still, complete and fairly well written.

  Why are these all Spacebattles? Because it's easy to find the stories and they have Reader Mode to make it easy to read.

      A warning for you and others: the author isn't great at dialogue (self professed in comments) and tends to avoid it which leaves some odd gaps.  There's also a fair bit of timeskip "and then he was super powerful..."

      Not really a bad story but there are potholes in this back country road.

  Always gonna recommend the Erogamer; be warned tho, it /is/ porn. It's also a very good, very philosophical gamer story that does a better job than many of grappling with the axiology of them.
