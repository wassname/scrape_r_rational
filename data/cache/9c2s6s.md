  That was a masterfully interesting way of showing Giovanni without *showing* Giovanni.  
  So many different people seeing different sides of him, and we're supposed to try and build ourselves an image through their no doubt biased perspectives.

  Though I have to ask two questions: Just how common are Renegades, that there are percentile statistics about how many were killed vs abducted? And how did Giovanni manage to conceive a child, if he's always been this cold and distant?

    Thanks! I was actually going to have a section from his perspective too, but decided fairly early on that I like the idea of a Dark character whose perspective isn't given, and that's where the idea of having a perspective from his personal psychic comes in. Like the reader, they're similarly unable to truly understand what Giovanni is thinking or feeling: just observe his actions.

    >Just how common are Renegades, that there are percentile statistics about how many were killed vs abducted? 

    In my head, a few dozen or so renegades get branded per year per region. The vast majority of them in most regions are killed.

    (How many of them are actually renegades is left as an exercise to the reader)

    >And how did Giovanni manage to conceive a child, if he's always been this cold and distant?

    Eh, I work with at-risk kids and families. Cold and distant people having kids is not particularly rare, unfortunately.

      Okay, P(renegade|branded)=P(renegade & branded) / P(branded)…

      Hmm, I think I need to step back to a certain previous chapter ;-)

      ```
      Thats unlikely ,  electric type gym leaders are obviously  resistant to electric moves , and weak to ground.  
      But humans have ridiculously  low hp so maybe he could die anyway I guess (seriously , level 1 pokemon  can 0hko even high level  humans in the right circumstances, humans are squishy, and somehow  weak to fire despite being clearly  water typed  )
      ```

      - u/Sailor_Vulcan:
        ```
        If humans are water typed simply because their bodies have a lot of water in them, then most large land dwelling Pokemon would also be water typed.

        Humans can swim sure, but they aren't the only non-water type Pokemon that can learn surf. As I see it, Human have a few forms with different typing: normal/psychic, normal/dark, normal/fighting and normal. It sometimes might seem like they have more forms than that but they don't. It just seems that way because their signature move, Sapient Comprehension, basically works like a cross between copycat and Smeargle's sketch move, except that it has REALLY high PP, has a low base accuracy which improves every time it's used after the same enemy move (resetting to base accuracy when used after a different move) and it doesn't disappear after it's been used. And since human's special ability, Memory Palace, let's them know a lot more than just four moves...

        They basically have the largest movepool of any Pokemon ever so they can adapt abnormally well to habitats and lifestyles that they aren't naturally equipped for.

        :P
        ```

        - u/crivtox:
          ```
          Yeah you are right about the water tiping.
          I  Aso heard that there are gost type humans but aparently that's just an urban legend .

          Sapient Comprehesion is really op , and worse ,in the pokeOutside meta nintendo seems to want to add a buffed version of  it in new AI mons this century which will unbalance the game even further .
          On ubers they  already had to ban certain used of sapient comprehension like  copying poison type moves .

          Though  for some reason copying vcreate is still not banned even if there is a game breaking bug that happens If two players use it against each other  , that can set the weather to "nuclear winter" for a long time  and kill all mons in both teams .
          :p

  Oh you tease, that Mewtwo part didn't even have a real Mewtwo! Kids these days and their vr tech, cant even have an old fashioned face-to-face anymore.

  "Silver blinks, then hurries back to his seat in front of the secured monitor that's connected directly to the camera in Father's office. The candy can wait." The image of Silver reaching for his oh-so delicious candy only to stop midway the moment his dad has another business meeting made me chuckle more than I would like to admit. On a related note, that's some serious hero worship he has towards his dad. If you're going to stick to Silver's og storyline then what the hell happens that'll turn him into an angsty anti-Gio teen/preteen? Gio would have to screw up pretty royally to get such a large change in his son's opinion of him. On another less related note, I now want to see a Blue/Silver chapter. They'd get along so well.

  Thanks again for the awesome chapter! See you in one month for the group reunion at the seasonal slaughterfest.

    There are a number of ways I can see this going, including changing the flavor or severity of how anti-Dad he becomes, but in general there's something to the idea of "the higher the pedestal, the harder the fall."
    ```

- u/None:
  ```
  What happens when you put a human in a Pokeball? The scientist guy reacted with terror, so I'm assuming it's really bad, but is it actually death? Mewtwo is half-human, and so they couldn't put him in a ball without risking 'damaging his mind'; is it that putting sapient beings in Pokeballs drives them insane? Is that why the scientist reacted badly; because he was about to be driven mad by an incomprehensible experience?

  Or is that it just inflicts brain damage on sapient beings; completely lethal to humans, and with a very high risk of at least significantly damaging the half-human Mewtwo's mind?
  ```

  - u/Real_Name_Here:
    ```
    You got it right. It was stated before that people come out mentally damaged. It is so bad that research into human/pokeball use has been banned.
    ```

    - u/nipplelightpride:
      ```
      It's too bad there isn't some shady group of people doing research that might be outside of certain laws.
      ```

  - u/sicutumbo:
    ```
    Pretty close. Not fatal brain damage, but I believe that it was described as turning an adult into a mental toddler. Normal Pokemon aren't smart enough to be affected by this.

    There was also that bit about how Bill has his AI programmed to put him into a ball if he suddenly dies, in the hope that the brain damage is preventable and he can be revived when technology gets better. It's why he doesn't leave his house.

    its his canon... to him pokeballs are containers, nothing more, nothing less.  Earlier in the fan fiction it relates that pokeballs aren't perfect in storage... human minds are very complex that those who are balled are effectively reduced to slightly improved vegetables.

    Personally, my "canon" is that pokemon are specialized energy creatures... this way i get around the shrinkification of everything... but i can't get around their transportation of regular items with this object.  I just reject the idea of instant transmission for regular items and go with the standard shipping via guy using a truck.

      Same, sort of. I go for the idea that pokeballs only reliably work on organic matter, so really they're only useful for pokemon. Maybe some specialized occupations like a butcher or botanist could use them for more efficient transport, but generally shipping still works like it does in our world.

      The whole world of Pokemon kind of suffers if pokeballs are just all-powerful containers. Entire cities in the games like Vermilion, Mistralton, and Slateport are all dependent on their shipping industry.
      ```

      - u/DaystarEld:
        ```
        Pokeballs actually work on everything: if anything they work MORE reliably on non-organic matter. We know this from the games, where pokeballs in the overworld contain items, and it helps explain how you can carry hundreds of potions and other items in a backpack, without invoking generic RPG bullshit-physics :P

        This was actually brought up as a major change to Vermilion when Leaf and Aiko are talking about the city back in chapter 48!

          Right, I was just sharing my personal headcanon about the world of Pokemon. I actually had that part about Vermilion in mind while I was writing it that comment out lol.

  Sakura's part was breathtaking, I really needed some "Renegades are people, too*

  Silver made me fangirl scream. Maxie and Archie blew my mind. I had spent time thinking how to make a story about them make sense. I just resigned to "radical religious background", but if someone can find an alternative, that one is you. I'm dying to know more about your version.

  Oh, and about Silver... He looks like an amazing character. So much potential. I dream of what story you could make, with a contrasting Gold with the "actually, those heroes had a point"

  And more mew2. That's always great. Thank you for all of this

  How old is pokeball tech? With Sakura, Giovanni seems to be interested in her methods, and he's talking like it's rare and exceptional to know how to actually manually train a pokemon without brainwash- I mean, "conditioning" them digitally. Are the old ways that old, and have they been stamped out that thouroughly? Or is he specifically interested in tricks that are specific to training kill commands, which official channels might understandably supress? But then, without a pokeball programming a pokemon to think that humans are special, surely any hunting pokemon could do that? Either way, I like interaction with the renegades.

  Love the dynamic among Team Magma. But then, I'm biased because Courtney is by far my favorite mook in the entire series. Pity that I don't expect to see much more of them now that they've served their narrative purpose to set up Giovanni's machinations.

  I agree that it's neat to see Giovanni's different faces all from the outside. Strangely, even after he kills a person, manipulates crime syndicates, and has his own son expect that he's plotting to kill his friends, I was still surprised when he casually murdered a guy. Given how Giovanni is shown to respect his resources, Dr. Collins must have done something quite foolish indeed. Pure coincidence that the timing of his punishment got some unrelated matter resolved instantly afterwards, I'm sure.
  ```

    >How old is pokeball tech?

    Professor Oak's generation was the first to grow up with it, though it was the big, heavy "basket ball" type that didn't have any mental conditioning involved.

    I couldn't be sure from the chapter, did Sakura live? It sounded to me like he was saying, "you don't deserve to die, but your morals mean that no one will buy your life, and I'm sorry that the system is so broken" - which would suggest he executed her as normal.
    ```

    - u/Anakiri:
      ```
      I share your reading, and I expect that she died. I also share your uncertainty. I would only be a little bit surprised to find out that Giovanni spared her. He's an ambiguous enough character that he might have actually gotten her a relatively normal life in exile, or else he might have found a use for her in one of the cleaner black projects. She might end up teaching actual anti-renegade teams; Giovanni's allowed to play both sides. But, yeah, I expect she's dead.

          - u/thrawnca:
            ```
            Well, saying that there are no trainers alive *or* able to help suggests that they could be alive without being able to help, or they could be able to help without being alive. The first makes sense, the second doesn't. Since what you need is a trainer who is both alive *and* able, that's what I'd suggest.

            However, if you're saying that there are in fact no living trainers at all, incapacitated or otherwise, then it's not necessary to talk about "able".
            ```

            - u/DaystarEld:
              ```
              The second one does make sense, actually, when you assume that the reason for bringing it up is that being "able to help slow it" is what's being scanned for as a separate quality. 

              "No one alive" is reporting on lack of survivors.

              "No one able" is reporting on the lack of help.

              They're two separate categories. To me the word "and" is actually the one that makes the "alive" redundant, because obviously if someone is able to help they're alive.

    "She knows better than to stop a bitchfest this massive before it lets off some steam, and despite what Dr. Collins said, she knows what it's like to be hurting for manpower too."
    It was Dr Sato who pointed out Cinnabar's special status, I'm not sure what Collins said that would prompt this.

    "Apologetic Resoluteness"
    Sounds like it should be Apologetic Resolution.  If it's meant to show Silver's childish side in making up words, it comes with too huge a gap between it and the only other made-up word, "judgey".

    I think there was a weird instance of "the [word] the", where the first "the" shouldn't be there, or read weirdly or something, but I can't find it again on mobile.  May try a regex when I get to my desktop, and edit this comment.
