  Hey everyone, welcome back! Technically still the 1st, with apologies to anyone living east of Germany.

  Quick note, I'm henceforth referring to the Mr. Mime family by its Japanese name, Barrierd. There will be some reference to its "real name" when it comes up again in the future, but the simple reason is that its English name is just badly designed on a number of levels; it's the only pokemon family whose names have two words, which makes lower case for non-proper-nouns look strange, and one of the words is an honorific, and it's a gendered honorific despite there being female Mr. Mimes. So yeah. Now it's barrierd, except for regions like Galar.

  (Oh yeah, I guess Sirfetch'd has a gendered honorific too. Well at least it's region specific. (Also it clearly should have been called Absir'd, come on…))

  Anyway, hope you enjoy the chapter, and if so, you should totally check out Crystal Society, by Max Harms!

    Your reasoning for changing Mr Mime makes sense, for sure. Do you have alternates in place for Mime Jr and Mr Rime as well?

    Also, on a slightly unrelated note, I'm curious about how many of the legendaries actually exist in TOoS. Mostly because some, like the Sinnoh Trio plus Arceus, seem more suited for being a religion instead, but then we have the reveal of Groudon and Kyogre potentially being actual creatures... Well, maybe I'm just caught up in excitement for the worldbuilding, but it does seem a pertinent question.

    And I guess while I'm on the topic of asking too many questions, does Kanto have a lower level of Pokémon diversity than other regions (considering the others generally have more Pokémon due to being post Gen 1) or are the native species mixed up compared to what they are in the games?

    Sorry for grilling you, but your worldbuilding is so fascinating! So many questions!

        Ahh, that makes sense. It prompts some more questions (are the latest four regions isolated from the first four such that we don't have, as an example, Unovan pokemon in the first four?) but it certainly answers the most pertinent in my eyes.

          > It prompts some more questions (are the latest four regions isolated from the first four such that we don't have, as an example, Unovan pokemon in the first four?)

          Well, yes, since the first four regions map to regions of Japan, but Unova is the eastern United States (which is why Surge, who is in Gen 1 referred to as "The Lightning American," is in this fic Unovan), Kalos is France, Alola is Hawaii, and Galar is England. So you'd expect the Pokemon unique to those to not show up in the first four regions, given how far apart the real-life counterparts are.

    I really liked the first two books, and the society-nature of those first two was the major thing I liked; the third book was rather disappointing in how little of the AI view we got.

    Related to the Crystal trilogy, I wonder if Victory >!lacks identification-with-Prime because it was created by the other tulpas, and so will seek to maximize its personal victory rather than a gestalt, kind of like what Growth realized very early.!<

      Agreed, there were a few things about book 3 that bothered me. Still glad I read the series, overall.

    - u/None:
      ```
      Prime Mewtwo doesn't know about his other selves during his interactions with Sabrina though, so he shouldn't have an opportunity to slip.
      ```

  - u/ManyCookies:
    ```
    That'd be pretty funny, although if that were the tell Sabrina would've mentioned that to her group ("They said something about 'we', so probably partition based?").
    ```

    - u/Galap:
      ```
      I get the impression that this is happening after she gave her students the assignment, that she suspected that Mewtwo was hiding things before this even happened.

      It's kind of funny to me how Mewtwo is so careful to not let on that he's more suspicious than he is and/or knows more than he does, but he's blowing it with something stupid like that. It's funny that he doesn't even realize it in retrospect.
      ```

      - u/MilesSand:
        ```
        Didn't mewtwo already escape in the previous interlude?  I thought that was the reason behind the  assignment. 

        This interlude is between the first half and end bits of the first.
        ```

        - u/DaystarEld:

          Can I ask what makes you think he escaped in any previous interludes?

  Spectacular chapter, with not one but *two* "oh shit" moments.

  I legit thought the ~1~ thing was some kind of typographical snafu for a while... though given the foreshadowing I feel like I could have figured it out if I'd been more observant.

  Thanks for writing as always.

    Funny thing? My first thought was "parallel mental thread" because I've seen similar syntax in a [With This Ring omake](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-thread-twelve.25032/post-6884874). But then it didn't seem to switch trains of thought, so I was confused again until it was explained.

  This was so incredibly cool. Mewtwo’s chapters continue to be my favorite ones, and they just keep getting even better.

  I guess Prime is his actual name? It feels good to have something to call him that he also feels comfortable calling himself. 

  Just, holy shit. What an amazing character, I can’t find words to describe how much I love him. I just want him to be happy! I have no doubts about Red Blue and Leaf having eventual happy endings, whatever form those take, but I’m very anxious about Prime’s fate, he is so complex. All of them are, and I love seeing how each of their stories develop, even if I sometimes don’t agree with them, but Prime is my treasured favorite.

  Thank you so much for the chapter!
  ```

  - u/Sir_William_V:
    ```
    I'm fairly sure Mewtwo prefers to be called Mazda since that is what Sabrina calls it. Prime is only what its [tulpas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulpa) call the part of Mewtwo's mind that directs them. I would not think Mewtwo would refer to itself as Prime if it were fully merged with the tulpas, but I could be wrong.
    ```

    - u/Leemorry:
      ```
      He got disillusioned with Sabrina pretty quickly, and that tainted the name she gave him. That’s how I remember it.

      > In the early years, this too filled me with pride, and joy, to have a name, even if it was a private one between myself and my teacher. Its charm has long since fled.

      .

      >  I would not think Mewtwo would refer to itself as Prime

      Why not? The way I see it, he wouldn’t call himself Mazda (for the reason mentioned above), and he would definitely not call himself Mewtwo. 
      He’ll get asked what his name is by someone, post-escape, and he’ll have an internal monologue about it, and he’ll decide to use Prime out of habit, if nothing else, mark my words :D

      > Only Dr. Fuji thinks to ask me. Only he wonders over a name for who I am, not what I am. But the others find his comments uninteresting. 

      He wanted to choose a name for himself, and I think tulpas still do count as “himself”, but of course we shall see.
      ```

      - u/Sir_William_V:
        ```
        Oh right, I had forgotten that Mewtwo stopped liking the name Mazda.

        I agree that he will probably choose a name for himself eventually, but I still don't think Mewtwo would pick Prime because that's just the name his tulpas use because they seek direction from it. Also because in my personal opinion that would be kind of dumb to call himself Prime, but I can't really defend that reason, haha. I would probably start to inadvertently imagine Optimus Prime fighting the legendary birds!
        ```

        - u/Leemorry:
          ```
          You know what, I guess you’re right, it would make sense to choose a new name, especially after escaping. I have no problems with Prime (transformers associations included :D) but it doesn’t sound enough like a real name, and he would probably want one of those, something more personal.
          ```

  Mewtwo chapters are the best. I love Red and the gang too, but this is like a rare treat. 

  At the beginning of the chapter I had a niggling thought in the back if my mind about how trusting he was being, it didn't quite line up. Then I saw the word tulpa and it made perfect sense.

  Ten years old already? More than I thought. Can't be that much longer before we catch up to the main story timeline. How long has Sabrina and Giovanni been gym leaders? That would at least but a cap on how long it can be.

    Victory is entirely reasonable, in the skynet/sword logic sense.  Mewtwo as an integrated entity was probably wise enough not to shape something like that, but its subminds partake only of their natures.
    ```

    - u/PathologicalFire:
      ```
      Mewtwo doesn't have it quite as bad as the proto-Hive krill, but it's still not hard to see it going full Oryx given time.

  Prediction: Victory will somehow defeat the other Tulpas, as well as Prime, and gain control of Mewtwo's body.
  ```

  - u/ManyCookies:
    ```
    I kinda hope that doesn't happen tbh, it'd effectively turn Mewtwo into Movie!Mewtwo and that's a much less interesting character.
    ```

    - u/eroticas:
      ```
      I don't think it will happen to that extreme, I just suspect that something along that spectrum will occur. The creation of Victory will definitely tilt the plot *more* than simply making Mewtwo better at combat. You can already sort of see how Victory already has all the others on the back foot even from birth. And as we saw with Safety who was suspicious of all the other tulpas (although not of prime) so it's possible for them to go into conflict.

       We've already got a weird situation where Prime is effectively a naive character which is manipulated by the others while the partition is down, which means that Prime is not in full control of this situation.
      ```

- u/Gummysaur:
  ```
  Daystar writing characters from pokemon: YOU get an alternate personality that isn't another person exactly but rather just another pattern of neurons firing in your mind that you aren't constantly aware of that you can consciously switch between, talk to, and share memories so it doesn't quite have the traits that would qualify it as dissociative identity disorder and neither personality can be called "real" or not because they are all the same self just with different outlooks but at the same time they are definitely not the same person even though they *are* the same brain so it begs the question of what a "person" or the "self" is and--

  \--Anyway, I continue to be unable to predict this story (or start off a comment with anything other than a joke). Was not expecting a Mewtwo interlude, and was not expecting the tulpas. I'm dying to know how Sabrina detected Mewtwo's (Prime's) perfect partition, considering he's literally not even aware of it himself. I'm really impressed by your ability to show-not-tell by letting us feel that Mewtwo in the beginning was acting *off,* but not straight out saying so. It's like Past Red in that he was still "Mewtwo", but the Mewtwo we knew wasn't quite there...then it turns out the guy just casually split himself into different Mewtwos that could guide his actions and then it made more sense. Fantastic as always.
  ```

- u/immortal_lurker:
  ```
  This sort of scenario, where not even your own  thoughts are considered safe, and the ruse must be upheld for years on end all while advancing your own agenda, is one that comes up every now and again in sci-fi/fantasy. 

  This is the first time that I've enjoyed it. Mewtwo is explicitly superhuman, and it doesn't break my suspension of disbelief that he can do it. I find all the tulpas to be amazing to read, always scheming and analyzing beneath the surface only to occasionally send single thoughts or emotions to the surface, and always doubting, always analyzing, never feeling safe, contrasted with the happy and friendly prime who they gently puppet/serve/subvert/are.

  Giovanni being their opponent is also incredible. Given his role in the story, he should be considered HPMoR!Voldemort levels of smart and prepared. All that scheming might really be necessary.

  Thanks for the chapter.

  Yes Mewtwo chapter!

  It looks like Red's multithreading theory is the most correct. Currently Red's aspects can't be detected, so if he (or Rowan) figured out how to keep them _active_ without merging that'd replicate what Mewtwo's doing. Heck he's already had live discussions between his aspects back in the psych visit chapter, without apparent partition swapping. 

  When did Zapdos pass over Cinnabar, was this an unrelated attack from the one the gang faced? Did they simulate the experience with a more mundane storm and some lesser, unseen pressure user (like the Absol)?

  I'm still really curious about what exactly happened that prompted Sabrina's task/AWOL, it doesn't look like she suspects anything yet. Fingers crossed for a double interlude!

  (We're up to what, _seven_ alternate personalities now? Sad Red, Past/Future Red, and Doubt/Trust/Flourish/Victory-Two? Any Disassociative Identity Disorders cases on your mind?)
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:

    It's a mundane storm, there's no pressure user being added in yet, Mewtwo's reaction was entirely their own :)
    ```

    - u/Leemorry:
      ```
      So is Mewtwo a they or a he?

      I saw a couple of places in this chapter where tulpas referred to each other and Prime as a “he”, (“Prime knows, even if we lack some of his processing power”) but those could be typos, so I’m still curious
      ```

      - u/Sir_William_V:
        ```
        Mewtwo is technically genderless, yes. I'm pretty sure that grammatically the use of 'he' is used when gender is unknown, as in this case.

          I was taught “they” is used when the gender is unknown (English isn’t my first language) Wikipedia seems to agree though https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_they

            I was taught to use 'he', but I guess that just shows my age. 'They' is probably better if we want to be PC, so you're right.

        ```
        Because this partition was created by other partitions without full consent or understanding from the most complete personality, because it absolutely appears to be slightly *off* with its intention to fight literally everything, and because in most of the Pokémon media this fic is somewhat adapting, Mewtwo goes on a destructive murder-rampage and the influence of an improperly created Victory partition seems - from a narrative sense - to be a likely cause of such behavior.

  I wonder how Mewtwo discovered tulpas in the first place? Also why exactly can they be shoved behind a partition and evade the mind scanning for the partition while still being able to influence Mewtwo at all? 

  But also like there's certainly a part of me that wonders about the you know psychological issues that would ensue from the lack of physical comfort and nurturing that a human would need in his(?)/it's(?)/they(?) place. Like we have more than a little reason to believe that Mewtwo is at least of Human equivalent intelligence/awareness/sapience/whatever, but given that they are a new species and with a new biology it's not my first assumption that they would need to be cared for as a human would in order to not face developmental issues. Or like even within say real life animals there is a lot of information that a lion cub does not receive when raised by people to the point that they need to be taught/trained to be able to exist in their natural habitat. Of course it's that's not a perfect metaphor for the current situation, but like how do you determine normal for a being that's the first/only one of it's kind?

    ?

    And should the "~ 1 ~" before "perhaps if i..." a little later be there?

    Also, why do you not capitalise the Pokemon's names? Is that just your convention so far? I confess I've only read the Mewtwo chapters haha.

    - u/DaystarEld:
      ```
      Fixed! Though the ~1~ is in the right place :)

      And yeah, pokemon specie names aren't proper nouns. There's really no reason for them to be treated as such, and it makes it extra confusing when a pokemon's name *is* its specie name, for trainers who don't nickname all their pokemon.

      How did you know this was a Mewtwo chapter so fast? Do you check each interlude as it comes out?

    Not sure if a typo or if foreshadowing, but Mewtwo refers to itself as “we” twice during the last scene. I’m inclined to believe this is a mistake because (iirc) Mewtwo isn’t supposed to be aware of his tulpa’s existence while his mind is partitioned, and I like Crystal Society the tulpas can’t fast track anything directly to the surface, just concepts and memories. If this was intentional I’m interested in what it implies.

  How does Sabrina hide from Mewtwo the fact that she is suspicious of him having a partition? I know that the tulpas inferred that she was suspicious of them, but wouldn’t all of Mewtwo (including Prime) be able to sense that because of the total merger? How is Sabrina hiding those thoughts? Any ideas?

  This was a really good chapter. I actually ended up waking up in the middle of the night and planning out how an eventual confrontation between Giovanni and Mewtwo would go, assuming the desired end result is a narrow action packed Mewtwo escape. You may have something different in mind, like a stealthy section where Mewtwo escapes via teleportation before they even finish realizing he's not on their side, or maybe Giovanni WINS and shuts down a Mewtwo escape by planning THAT well. And if so, that's fine too and I will happily read them! But since I really felt inspired about this, I wanted to share:

  First, it seems inevitable that a confrontation will happen and you've set it up nicely. Giovanni and Sabrina are skeptical that Mewtwo is being honest about fighting prowess. The general approach to dealing with a Pokemon that isn't doing what you want, but that you don't want to kill, is to put it in a pokeball, because they come pre-equipped with training and analytic technology.  Giovanni has pokeballs that work on sentient targets. There is no way I can imagine Mewtwo accepting being put into a pokeball. It would be weird if Giovanni didn't think to do this, unless I missed something about the scenario, although since I can predict it will lead to trouble, he can too. But if you assume that Mewtwo is going to resist being put into a pokeball, a confrontation might go something like this:

  Giovanni assumes that Mewtwo will resist being put into a pokeball, and also that because they are generally skeptical of his mental state, it's not safe to assume he is actually sleeping when he is sleeping. So while he is sleeping, under guard, he gets a Wigglytuff or some other sedative style pokemon to further deepen his sleep.

  Mewtwo has multiple partitions, so likely a front partition will fall asleep, but a rear one (Victory) will not. So the initial pokeball probably gets deflected at it's user and sucks him up instead. A bunch of backup pokeballs get tossed at Mewtwo by the rooms guard trainers, and he deflects them all back at their users. All of the trainers had their pokemon told to take backup orders from Giovanni, so Giovanni orders their pokemon to attack. Mewtwo endures the fastest attacks (priority breakers like Quick Attack) while he tears down the ceiling and uses it as a shield to block the dark attacks that are a bit slower. Mewtwo is hurt, but can continue to tear through ceilings to fly right out.

  Giovanni will guess healing is available (otherwise Mewtwo would know it would be doomed in an escape attempt) and will shrug off suggestions that Mewtwo is dying and immediately calls in reinforcements, led by Sabrina to find him. Those reinforcements teleport in to some nearby point that had been previously kept out of Mewtwo's line of sight (I can't imagine they'd want him having practice teleportation until he's VERY trusted) But Mewtwo has been hiding his talent at psychic powers, so he can reverse engineer the effect to teleport back to where the reinforcements  teleported from, and then heal and fly away. This also sets up, but doesn't require, Mewtwo running into Red in some sort of early appearance, if Sabrina teleported from her Gym to get there.

  Thanks for writing and I look forward to the next chapter!
  ```

  - u/covert_operator100:
    ```
    Giovanni does have hacked Pokeballs that can catch humans, but he still doesn't have the tech to pull humans back out of stasis with their sapience intact. Bill is stilll working on that part. 

    In effect, balling Mazda would end the project, forcing the creation of a Mewthree (which they can't really do, Mewtwo was largely a fluke iirc)
    ```

    - u/michaelos22:
      ```
      This is a good point. I’ll reread the story and brush up on the details, I’ve done that before with other works, and this one is definitely worth putting in that category.
      ```

- u/ForMyWork:

  Damn, Victory means business! It'll be interesting to see how Victory affects the others , and most importantly, Prime. Very enjoyable chapter to read, the interaction between them all was great, and it is nice to have had an update Mazda's situation, and the implications it may have for Red. Speaking of Red, I hope he'll start following a similar thread to Mazda, but in his own seperate way, from the ground up with his unique position.
  ```

- u/MilesSand:
  ```
  Sounds like future red has a better system in place than mewtwo prime.  Once an adversary detects any secondary mewtwo they know what's up and will be ready for it, while an adversary against future red will think they know what they're up against and that they can easily see through it but in reality the main red is hidden beneath the surface, guiding both present and past red


  That said,  since Trust is the one who created Victory, the Tulsa probably has way more access than it should. If it decides Trust is in its way to victory it may decide to find a way to take advantage.  Hopefully Prime will get to meet and guide Victory first.
  ```

  - u/nipplelightpride:
    ```
    >since Trust is the one who created Victory,

    I believe all three of them worked together to create Victory.

      They all had input but Trust is the only one who has the control over the mind to actually make it happen.

- u/ManyCookies:
  ```
  So this view of M2's mind was quite different from chapter 40, not so much in effect but terminology. From 40:

  > It is a hard thing to keep my mind partitioned. To let the false-hope, the harmless-hope, show on the surface for Sabrina to read, while inside the desperate, anguished, starving hope rends at me. I sense her concern as my mask leaks briefly, and some of my true feelings go through. 

  So _Doubt_ was narrating most of Chapter 40, and the "mask" was Prime?

    I think the tulpas are a newer technology.
    ```

  - u/covert_operator100:
    ```
    Mazda didn't have Tulpas then. He had an imperfect shield where he was trying to project harmless-hope to prevent the starving-hope from being noticed.

    With Tulpas, his conscious self isn't even aware of problems or reasons to distrust Sabrina and Giovanni.

  Curious what you feel about tulpas IRL (as opposed to a storytelling device). Or is it just something that only psychics can do in the story world?

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    I don't think they have enough evidence behind them for non-psychics in our world for me to have a strong opinion about them one way or the other, but I do have minor anecdotal evidence that points in the direction of something like tulpas being possible: namely that characters I write often enough often feel very "alive" in a way that makes them actually feel like independent conscious beings at times, commenting on what I write about them and having independent thoughts/ideas about what they should do.

  What an amazing chapter. So unique, and I have enjoyed every word, I feel I could read a whole book of just this. Mazda's mind is fascinating, I want to grab inspiration for a sapient AI. And the way you are connecting it with how both blue and read think.

  And the references to groudon and kyogre... I need more of that. "Pokemon the Origin of Continents" please

  Crack theory: Past Red is actually a tulpa, and RED is the one that Sabrina expects has the perfect shield, not Mazda/Mewtwo/Prime.

    DaystarELD has confirmed that Sabrina is using Amnesia to hide her suspicions from Mazda, so I'm pretty sure that crack theory is just doa.
