## [RT][Repost] Everything by Ted Chiang

### Post:

Ted Chiang is an author noteworthy for his excellent rational science fiction. I consider his work to be some of the most relevant to this subreddit. He pretty much exclusively writes short stories, and they're all amazing. Many of you will have read his writing, but I feel like since it has been some months since the last "Everything by Ted Chiang" post, it's time for a new post to show our new readers some of the very best this genre has to offer.

The first story of his I read was [Exhalation](http://www.nightshadebooks.com/Downloads/Exhalation%20-%20Ted%20Chiang.html), the story of a scientist who isn't afraid to face the truth. I cried at the end, because the beauty of the story was too much for me. Read it first, and you will end up reading the rest of his work.

Many of his short stories are in a collection for sale on [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Stories-Your-Life-Others-Chiang/dp/1931520720/), or you can read them [online](http://www.ibooksonline.com/88/Text/tower.html). One short story, [The Truth of Fact, The Truth of Feeling](http://subterraneanpress.com/magazine/fall_2013/the_truth_of_fact_the_truth_of_feeling_by_ted_chiang) is not in that collection, but is available online and generally considered an excellent rationalist work.

I highly recommend all of Ted Chiang's stories.

  Thank you for showing me links to his stories. I've been finding more and more of his writings to read, but there's always just one more story of his I missed.

  For people first learning about rationalist fiction, I consider Ted Chiang's works to be ***the*** first thing one should read, then Eliezer's short fiction stories as a warm-up before hitting them with the epic length ones like HMPOR, Luminosity, Worm, and Ra. The finale is, of course, a lifetime membership on /r/rational as one of our minions to scour the Internet for more rationalist gems.

  Ted Chiang is one of my favourite authors, I can't recommend him enough. He's a brilliant writer, and he seems incredibly knowledgeable about a lot of things, even accounting for the fact that he chose what to mention in his writing. I'd strongly recommend *The Story of Your life and Others* and *Understand*. *Understand* is a good example of a super-intelligent character being written well, and the limits of super-intelligence actually being explored.

  *The Story of Your Life and Others* draws parallels between linguistics and physics, and it touches strongly upon the concepts of free will and determinism. It's about first contact with truly *alien* aliens who visit Earth.

  I read Exhalation in a short story collection.  What a fantastic story.  Thanks for reposting, I'll be looking up more of his work.
