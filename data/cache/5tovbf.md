  The Daimen meeting is almost there... Next chapter sounds like loads of fun.

      ```
      If it turns out that Zorian could have found out loads of helpful information about the Key just by talking to his mother any time in the past 4 years, then he's going to be kicking himself. Maybe he'll literally summon an extra simulacrum just for the purpose of kicking himself.
      ```

      - u/Frommerman:
        ```
        Wouldn't that be sweet justice? Kid actively avoids his family except his kid sister for four years, going so far as to teleport out of their house on some occasions, then finds out his entire quest would have been five times simpler if he'd done literally anything else.
        ```

      - u/MoralRelativity:
        ```
        Oh, that would be so funny. Both the need to talk with his mother, and him getting kicked by his simulacrum. Do you think the simulacrum would enjoy it?
        ```

        - u/braiam:
          ```
          Nope, he would get kicked back and the memories of the pain transmitted to the original.
          ```

      - u/Xtraordinaire:
        ```
        He knows about the key only for several months so I doubt that it will be that way. I did say back when he warmed up to Kirielle that maybe he will improve relationships with other family members as well. Kinda went that way with Fortov. 

        So maybe Damian will get some love too. After ZnZ wipe the floor with him, of course.
        ```

        - u/thrawnca:
          ```
          > He knows about the key only for several months

          But what if talking to his mother about what Daimen is doing would have given him clues to it years earlier? Or, at least, given him information whose importance became clear as soon as he learned about the Key?

          > After ZnZ wipe the floor with him

          Time will tell, but I suspect that after Zorian has spent so long griping about his older brother, the story won't give him that satisfaction :D.

        It seems really out of character for their father, who's been portrayed as not the type to have fun and show affection, only approval. I suspect there will be some big event with lots of nobles and merchants, and his father wants to make some connections. Maybe treasure auction or something.
        ```

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    I suspect Daimen will turn out to be much friendlier than Zorian gave him credit for. And he'll get along great with Zach :D. Leading to a split, with Zach and Daimen on one side, and *n* Zorians on the other...
    ```

    - u/FireHawkDelta:
      ```
      This would be great. Daimen saying he regrets how he was as a teenager and currently being an alright guy, leaving Zorian with no one to get sibling justice on.

      I still think that it's quite likely that Daimen is a psychic, like Zorian. No idea to what extent, though.

      - u/thrawnca:
        ```
        Zorian speculated that Daimen may be an active psychic, back when Batak told him that empathy is usually hereditary. Apparently Daimen is good at reading people.

        I'm guessing that Daimen has only empathy, not telepathy, but has better control of it than Zorian previously did.

    Well, in the long term, I'm sure that they could massively increase the efficiency of Black Rooms. But that's not feasible to try within the Sovereign loop.

        Maybe they're using soul magic because it's the closest analogue they understand to whatever they should be using. It's like using a dusty N64 cartridge: It'll work, sometimes, but you need to jiggle it around a little bit and keep trying to fire it up.
        ```

  - u/kaukamieli:
    ```
    Oh... The Sovereign Gate is a computer!

    This is all a computer simulation.

    Sovereign gate has this fancy AI that your soul can hook into. Then it simulates the world, but it can't handle simulating gods or stuff.

    User gets better at magic, because it interacts with the admins soul and magical power is about information, which the soul can get there, and the computer is so fast multiple time loops can happen instantly until it runs out of power.

    The computer can simulate souls and hook any real soul to a simulated soul, which is how Zorian got there. It can also save the data back to the real soul, which is what Z&Z are trying to do.

    Probably not the first to think about this. There was the talk about ADMIN keys and stuff after all, when they touched the gate.

    Time looping really is impossible. But they bypassed that by having blazing fast virtual reality that can feed you back what you learned.

    That's also how the black room operates. It's just very very slow compared to that and the area is very very limited.

    EDIT: black room can't operate like that, could be real time magic, but is probably a trick of some kind as it's closed off the world for the time.
    ```

    - u/throwawayIWGWPC:
      ```
      Essentially, what you're saying is . . . 

      The sovereign gate is an elaborate illusion, and by illusion, I mean a magical and purely graphic/haptic interface that models the world---a literal computer simulation.

      Rather than rebuilding the world atom-for-atom, it just models the world graphically/hapticly. This approach would require significantly less mana to do, especially because the area you would need to time dilate would not need to be bigger than a freaking laundry closet.

      The marked soul would *feel* like it's interacting with real stuff, thus giving realistic training for a fraction of the mana cost.
      ```

      - u/kaukamieli:
        ```
        >The marked soul would feel like it's interacting with real stuff, thus giving realistic training for a fraction of the mana cost.

        Yes, and magical power is just data in the soul. They probably didn't know enough about soul to just tweak some numbers with "hexedit", so they simulated the thing instead. Like we can't just code AI that is good at playing Go, but we had to show it games and make it learn instead.
        ```

        - u/throwawayIWGWPC:
          ```
          Right. That level of fine tweaking is beyond us right now and was probably beyond the capabilities of the Maker as well.

          In fact, as a rule, knowledge may be too complex to efficiently upload into someone's mind wholesale. Running a computer or a person through a speed simulation may be, surprisingly (or unsurprisingly, giving the current state of machine learning), the best way of assimilating knowledge.
          ```

    - u/GoXDS:
      ```
      oh, and probably the strongest evidence to contradict a simulation is the one month limit. the Guardian has stated that the whole reason one month was set is because mass killing of souls is unethical but killing a copy is tolerable. one month is within tolerance of a copy soul being "the same" as the original as there's not enough divergence to claim they're different. but if it's all a simulation, none of the simulated souls are actual, real souls. then there should be no ethical issues at all in wiping it out, is there?
      ```

      - u/throwawayIWGWPC:
        ```
        Yeah, there's definitely the opinion that if an AI is advanced enough to make it indistinguishable in behavior from a person, then it is a person in all important ways. Turning it off is equivalent, or at least is nearly equivalent, to killing a person, and that should give us just as much pause.

        I'm glad this theory was proposed and explored by you guys. It led to some interesting places.

        /u/kaukamieli
        ```

      - u/kaukamieli:
        ```
        You know some people think it is not ok to kill an AI, so about those ethical issues...

        But I do agree I've been presented with some good reasons why this is not it.
        ```

    - u/throwawayIWGWPC:
      ```
      You may want to give chapters 54 and 55 a reread. As much as I like this hypothesis, I was looking at these chapters and they cast doubt on the computer simulation idea.
      ```

    - u/GoXDS:
      ```
      if there's a "real" soul to feed back to, there's no reason the simulated souls should ever receive dmg that stays across restarts
      ```

      - u/kaukamieli:
        ```
        Only if you want to lose the damage too. It doesn't reload the "real" soul every time and save stuff back to it. It copies your soul when you start and only overwrites the original if you "exit" before the system crumbles. It can only save the whole state, not just what you learned and stuff.

        Technically it _could_ have been built to notice when the soul is too damaged to save and use a backup of the soul instead, but it apparently wasn't. Though if you don't remember the last reset, you would just do same things again.
        ```

    - u/throwawayIWGWPC:
      ```
      I love this idea. It would be a very elegant solution, especially because it'd be significantly cheaper than actually recreating the world atom-for-atom.
      ```

      - u/thrawnca:
        ```
        > it'd be significantly cheaper

        In terms of mana, perhaps. But in terms of processing power? Modelling every subatomic interaction of a sphere with a radius of one light-month?

        Also, the fact that its activation is tied to the planar alignment makes me think that it's real and spending mana, rather than a simulation.
        ```

        - u/throwawayIWGWPC:
          ```
          It's unclear how the magic works, but advanced heuristics might ease the processing power difficulties of such a model.

          To give an example, the US Air Force recently developed an AI that consistently out-class top pilots, even when the AI is handicapped. To accomplish this feat, it was unnecessary to for the computer to model neurons arranged as well-trained brain; only the emergent phenomena were needed: piloting ability, strategic planning, etc.

          Maybe this advanced illusion uses heuristics to bypass modeling atomic and subatomic interactions perfectly.

          I mean, the Sovereign Gate is already able to perform a planetary scan and recreate details and information that would not necessarily have be accessible to the Maker. Maybe this scan allows a high-fidelity illusion to be constructed.

  - u/sambelulek:

    I agree it sounds fantastic, and I wonder at what cost. Remember that only Silverlake is ever suspected to master the spell. To put it into perspective, Xvim never recognize one, while Black Room strictly a hasting pocket.

- u/over_who:
  ```
  This chapter was immensely satisfying. Finally seeing some progress on deep mysteries, finally having assurances of meeting Daimen. I am glad that the Silverlake thread might be meaningful, and that there are still challenges that aren't easily leapfrogged with the loops. 

  March 5th can't some soon enough.
  ```

  - u/MoralRelativity:
    ```
    Agreed. I found the final scene particularly satisfying. That's quite some leverage they've managed to apply to learning about the gates. Very, very smart work.
    ```

- u/thrawnca:
  ```
  I *thought* that Zorian's idea of sending a simulacrum to Koth so he could use the Black Rooms was flawed. Sure enough.

  If they can manage to release the primordial into the loop and keep it there during a reset, that's almost certainly the end of the thing (although, if there is a reliable and safe method of primordial disposal, why wasn't it used originally instead of imprisoning them?).
  ```

  - u/cathemeralman:
    ```
    That method of disposing primordials assumes that their pocket-dimensional prisons put them somewhere outside both the real world and the time-loop world, somehow connecting to both at the same time (i.e., the primordials and prisons aren't themselves duplicated in the time-loop world).

    I came up with an idea similar to Zorian's a few chapters ago--using the dimensional break to move between the loop and the real world. I discarded the idea because it seemed unlikely that there's only *one* Panaxeth prison which is anchored in two separate worlds, but I guess nobody103 thinks it's plausible.
    ```

    - u/thrawnca:
      ```
      I don't think that it's clear yet whether or not the primordial and its prison are duplicated by the loop.

      Presumably other pocket dimension contents, like Silverlake's house, are cloned. Things would get pretty weird otherwise (eg entering and leaving the temporal acceleration). And there's no indication that her comings and goings are treated as a loop breach, so presumably they are considered to be part of the loop.

      We can presume that the Maker knew lots about the primordials and their prisons. So it's possible that they have special rules. And if there are special rules to keep primordials contained, then that means primordials are a threat to even a pocket dimension. Which tends to support the idea that the Maker would *not* have the Gate create thousands of copies of them and then attempt to dispose of them each time; instead, it would just continue the strategy of keeping them contained, by destroying the pocket universe and thus the bridge when there is a danger of escape.

      But it's only speculation.
      ```

      - u/Frommerman:
        ```
        >We can presume that the Maker knew lots about the Primordials and their prisons.

        Actually, we can't presume that. The Maker clearly didn't even have a solid grounding in soul magic. We can tell this because the Sovereign Gate's UI has no idea how to deal with multiple Controllers, and seems to think that having multiple controllers is impossible. At the very least, the Maker didn't know about the soul fusing curse. Even though they were capable of creating a hereditary soul marker for controlling the gate, they didn't know that it would be possible to use mechanics in the loop to bug the system and didn't bother creating any contingencies for them.

        This is why I think it's more likely that the Maker just made the gate force end the loop because they didn't know what else to do about that kind of disaster. They didn't know how to re-bind a Primordial, and since they were already creating and destroying a massive pocket dimension anyway, why not just push the ultimate panic button? It's the simplest solution when you don't know what else to do.
        ```

        - u/thrawnca:
          ```
          Having a thorough knowledge of soul magic, and having a thorough grounding in robust defensive programming practices, are two different things.
          ```

        - u/Fredlage:
          ```
          > The Maker clearly didn't even have a solid grounding in soul magic

          Seriously? Every soul mage who has taken a look at the soul marker was awed at how well crafted it was. The loop has mechanisms for detection of soul damage (to the point where wrenching it out of the controller's body is enough to trigger it) and it did protect Zach from damage by the soul meld. The addition of Zorian to the loop was a fluke that is most likely irreproducible, and the Guardian not understanding the presence of more than one controller just shows that the Maker was a little too confident in their knowledge of soul magic and was certain that there couldn't be two controllers.
          ```

      - u/cathemeralman:
        ```
        These are very good points. I suppose if pocket dimensions weren't duplicated, Zorian and Zach could just exit the time loop via Silverlake's house. That would be far too convenient.

        Since this is the case, I'm very unclear on what Zorian's logic is re:Primordial prisons. Perhaps he also thinks primordial prisons are somehow exceptional when it comes to pocket dimensions within the loop. Maybe the reason why the loop automatically terminates when the primordial is summoned is because the gods can't actually destroy a world with a primordial in it (since this would involve destroying the primordial, which they apparently can't do). Successfully letting a primordial into the copy world might stop the looping mechanism altogether.
        ```

        - u/space_fountain:
          ```
          I think the problem is the Primordial's themselves. It sounds like they are at least similar in power to the entity that created the loop itself. The idea that you could make a copy of them seems really odd even with copying everything else.
          ```

          - u/Caliburn0:
            ```
            Compared with copying an entire planet, it shouldn't be that hard.
            ```

            - u/space_fountain:
              ```
              Maybe? I forget exactly how the premedials were described, but it's worth noting that the Gods were not copied. Premedials are at least close.
              ```

              - u/Caliburn0:
                ```
                Well... the gods are in a other dimension. Depending on the power of the gods, it shouldn't be impossible to copy themselves, and I get the impression that Primordials are weaker.
                ```

        - u/thrawnca:
          ```
          > Perhaps he also thinks primordial prisons are somehow exceptional

          They are, in some way: breaching one triggered a loop reset. So there's *something* different about those prisons. Apparently the Maker either didn't want the primordial to get into the loop, or didn't want anything from the loop to reach the prison. Or both. Either one would tend to suggest that the prison is unique, not copied.
          ```

          - u/throwawayIWGWPC:
            ```
            A model that supports this is to think of each dimension as a bubble, which I'll give a letter to.

            The real world is the bubble A. The loop is a separate bubble B, that connects to bubble A at one point.. 

            Pocket dimensions are tiny bubbles attached to their main bubble. Non-loop pocket dimensions are A1, A2, etc. Loop pocket dimensions are B1, etc. These tiny bubbles only interface with one main dimension, so only one speed of time needs to be observed.

            However, a primordial's dimension interfaces with both the non-loop and loop dimensions. Thus, when the primordial's dimension is accessed, the sovereign gate senses a new connection to the non-loop dimension and ends the loop to break that connection.
            ```

            - u/thrawnca:
              ```
              Nice analogy, but are you modelling the prison as an A-bubble, or a B-bubble?
              ```

              - u/throwawayIWGWPC:
                ```
                Er, I should have specified: 

                The prison would be an A-B bubble, as it intersects the temporal reference frames of both dimensions A and B.

                Accessing any A-B-type dimensions would create a temporal conflict due to the time dilatation that would have to be reconciled between the normal and loop dimension.

                However, this analogy may be incorrect if Zorian can successfully access the primordial's pocket dimension by wrapping it in a second pocket dimension:

                The sovereign gate restarted when the primordial summoning occurred---it has a fail-safe. If that fail-safe is indeed to prevent conflicting time references, then a loop pocket dimension B1 with a time dilatation of B that wraps around a primordial A-B dimension with a time dilatation of A would not bypass the fail-safe.

                Wow, I feel like that explanation is going to be confusing to read. Sorry :P

                If time dilatation conflicts are somehow not an issue for the sovereign gate, however, then my guess is that wrapping a primordial A-B dimension in a pocket dimension *should* allow Zorian to tunnel into non-loop dimension relatively easily.

                I say relatively easily because if Zorian learns how to wrap a primordial dimension in a secondary pocket dimension, then learns how to tunnel into the primordial dimension, then my guess is that tunneling into the non-loop dimension will already be a subset of what he learned.
                ```

                - u/thrawnca:
                  ```
                  > tunneling into the non-loop dimension will already be a subset of what he learned.

                  Yes and no. Remember that, regardless of your skills, pocket dimensions only connect to others at specific points.

                  It could well be the case that tunnelling through the primordial's prison back into the real world requires more skill than passing through the direct connection located at the Sovereign Gate. However, if it allows Zorian to bypass the Gate security system, it's still worthwhile.
                  ```

    - u/DerSaidin:
      ```
      Iirc, the primordials are also surposed to be the source of Mana. You would need to connect the looping dimension to the primordial prisons to supply the population (and maybe the SG itself) with Mana.
      ```

      - u/cathemeralman:
        ```
        They *seem* to be *a* source of mana.

        From Chapter 59:
        >Finally, he walked over to the Hole and spent some time peering into its fathomless depths, idly wondering whether the primordial’s prison was placed here because of the Hole or if the Hole was the product of the prison being placed here.

        There is definitely a strong connection between powerful mana wells and primordials, but it hasn't been confirmed that Panaxeth is producing the mana coming from the Hole.

        The primary source of mana in the world (besides the mana automatically produced by people's souls) has never been confirmed either, though according to the Ikosian creation myth it is the "heart of the World Dragon, from whose body the entire world was fashioned."

      They have other things to do during the invasion, like raid the library. The initial assault already succeeded; they pinpointed the ritual location, identified the shifter children and many of the cult's inner circle, and learned the ritual's true goal. It might be worth visiting the ritual platform again directly, to get the remaining names, but until they have a reasonable strategy for obtaining the crown, it's just not a good risk-benefit tradeoff to challenge QI again.

          But the question remains, Is it worth doing *first*? Zach's combat magic may have peaked, but Zorian will get better and better as they keep working on seeking the other keys.

          Who knows; maybe obtaining some of the pieces might even help them to unlock their Controller powers.

  - u/thrawnca:

    > it's possible to separate QI and his part of the Key

    Yeah, but I'm not sure how helpful it would be. At the very least he'll know of its historical value, if not its magical importance, and he'll want it back. Especially if they show up, grab it, and run; that's a huge tip-off to him that the crown is very significant (important enough for very powerful and skilled mages to take the time and risk to challenge *him*, in the middle of the invasion, just to obtain it).

    So they would probably end up having to kill him somehow anyway.

    - u/kaukamieli:

        > Forcing him back to his phylactery worked once

        Yes, but if you can do that, then you don't need to bother blasting his crown off first. Just take it from his corpse.
        ```

        - u/Frommerman:

          Precisely. They already have an easy method to get the crown when they need it.

              I they should spend a couple restarts trying to recreate that situation.

              I would expect doing so to be very difficult, as RR is gone, as are the aranea who were aggressively interfering with the invasion, which means it's impossible to retrace that loop the way it happened originally.

              In fact, the entire pretext for Zorian using the coin on was entirely dependent on RR and the aranea. The reason QI and company only showed up in the dance hall in the first place was because Red Robe was searching for Zach so as to learn who the other time loopers were.

              > Unlike the lich and the vampire girl, who did their best to look dignified and imposing, Red Robe (which is how Zorian promptly named him in his head) walked carefully and scanned the shocked crowd with interest, his cowled head swinging left and right in search of something. Or someone, as it turned out: the moment his eyes locked onto Zach he immediately stopped and spoke.

  Zorian should take the Bakora Gate activation ritual to some experts he knows.

  The aranea have more practical experience with opening the Gate, but I doubt that they're soul magic specialists. Being secretive and lacking hands, they'd have an even harder time making soul sight potions than humans do, if they even know how, and their smaller natural mana reserves would make enhancements less affordable. So I suspect that none of them have soul sight.

  Kael and/or Alanic may be able to offer some valuable advice about why the Gate activation ritual is so hit-and-miss, and how to fix it.

      Zorian doesn't need the web's cooperation. He watched them and then made a memory packet of the experience. He can demonstrate it to others at will, maybe even let them experience it themselves if they let him in.

      > not providing any huge competitive advantage over the other webs.

      On the contrary; if they can quickly and reliably activate the Bakora gates with a single aranea, then they indeed have huge advantages over other webs, both military (logistics, communication) and economic (directly trading transportation services, or using it to efficiently trade other goods and services).

          It makes a big difference if, say, you're losing a fight and need to escape, or call in reinforcements. It makes a big difference to the total number of trips you can manage in a day. It would surely make a difference to the kind of courier fees you could charge.

          And there's also the fact that it would be one spell for one aranea, instead of potentially magically exhausting 15 of them.

      - u/throwawayIWGWPC:

        I'm not sure Zorian is able to directly, mind-to-mind convey memory information. However, the memory packet should allow him to accurately reproduce the ritual via illusions.
        ```

        - u/thrawnca:
          ```
          > directly, mind-to-mind convey memory information

          He passes memory packets back and forth with his simulacra all the time. He worked out a while ago how to establish a two-way telepathic link with non-psychics (from practising with Tinami). He can alter people's senses and edit their memories. I'm pretty sure he's capable of transmitting an experience to a willing recipient.
          ```

          - u/throwawayIWGWPC:
            ```
            His simulacra are all mind mages of significant ability.

            He can convey speech and he can read minds.

            He can delete memories and fudge senses.

            These abilities don't mean he implant memories wholesale like a movie. Remember how long it took him to learn how to interpret the memory packet? If I recall correctly, it wasn't merely hard to read the memory packet because it was given to him by an aranea. There was also the difficulty of successfully opening a memory packet without damaging the information.

            And mind you, this took a lot of training for someone who had already spent years learning mind magic and is a natural mind mage to begin with.

            I may be totally wrong and maybe he can implant movie-esque memories into people's heads, but I feel that's stretching it. And I should also mention that he had to train his kind to be able to store high-fidelity memories in the first place---which is not skill that even Zach seems to share.

            I doubt so-and-so ritual master will be able to do all that, or would be happy with Zorian blatantly implanting memory packets in their mind. Anyone he hires is essentially a stranger.

            But I hope I'm wrong about it because it would be very convenient for him to simply go around hiring prominent ritual specialists, implanting all their minds with a perfect memory of the Silent Adepts ritual.
            ```

            - u/thrawnca:
              ```
              Zorian had no difficulty understanding the memory packets that the matriarch implanted in the males, nor did he have trouble understanding the message she left inside him.

              The reason he did all that training is because he thought he would have to interpret the whole packet himself - which, in hindsight, would never have worked, simply because her thoughts are beyond him. But when she wanted him to understand a packet, it was easy for him.

  This chapter is awesome, can't wait to see what they find with regards to the gate.

  Unrelated to this chapter, but I was wondering why Witches used things like enhancements if their cost is so high. It's possible the reason mind magic lowers Zorians mana reserves significantly is because enhancements don't inhibit the growth of the reserves.  Since Zorian was young and had yet to grow it seemed like his reserves were below average, but if not for the mind magic ability it might have been closer to his brothers! That's maybe why he can cast expensive spells like the gate spell and keep simulacrums. It's so simple and obvious but I never thought of it like that until now...
  ```

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    > enhancements don't inhibit the growth of the reserves

    Yes, the author has confirmed that.

    For example, Zorian is magnitude 8; let's say that his mind magic costs him 2 points, so he would normally be 10. In that case, he'll eventually grow to 38 = (4 * 10) - 2, not 32 = 4 * (10 - 2). Although his increased magic missile skill makes it infeasible to measure that.
    ```

    - u/Vakuza:
      ```
      The real question is what enhancements does Zorian have, and how much they cost for him. I reckon he's got some sort of foresight ability, but it seldom shows for some reason. Maybe if his soul sight advances enough he'll understand it and whatever other secret abilities he might have.
      ```

      - u/thrawnca:
        ```
        > some sort of foresight ability

        That's an inherent part of being Open: natural talent with divinations, occasional prophetic dreams.
        ```

      - u/notintractable:
        ```
        has he displayed foresight?
        ```

        - u/Vakuza:
          ```
          Just before Quatach-Ichl tried to bind their souls Zorian moved Zach out of the path of a flying projectile he couldn't see, acting on impulse from something.  
          Chapter 4 about 3/4 down, starts with "Zorian wasn't sure what tipped him off..."
          ```

          - u/thrawnca:
            ```
            It could even have been an instinctive reaction to the presence of QI's powerful and dangerous mind - or emotions. We know that he was using a degree of empathy before he had any training.
            ```

                QI would have mind shielding, yes. But would he have been using Mind Blank and thus be invisibile to empathy? Not necessarily.
                ```

              - u/throwawayIWGWPC:
                ```
                Also, considering QI has been around for a 1000 years, I would guess he is fairly conservative about using mind-damaging spells like Mind Blank.
                ```

              - u/thrawnca:
                ```
                Hang on, here's another possibility: Zorian "just got a vague feeling of dread", according to chapter 4. Maybe that was from someone else in the vicinity (Akoja?) who saw QI and was terrified?
                ```

      - u/kaukamieli:
        ```
        Is the cost like -2, or is it like -20% growth? Does the cost actually limit anything if you have time to grind like Zorian?
        ```

        - u/nobody103:
          ```
          -2

        - u/thrawnca:
          ```
          > Does the cost actually limit anything if you have time to grind like Zorian?

          Yes, your reserves will eventually max out, as Zach's have done.
          ```

          - u/kaukamieli:
            ```
            But unlike others, you _will_ get it maxed and you will also get very efficient at casting stuff so I think it kinda evens itself out.
            ```

            - u/Cheese_Ninja:
              ```
              Maxing reserves doesn't seem to be difficult, just a slow matter of casting magic frequently for about 10-20 years.

              Depending on the permanent enhancement type, (ritual vs blood magic?) it might be passed on to their descendants, and too high a mana cost would make them stillborn/inconceivable. Inherited abilities are at minimum cost, and acquired ones have varied efficiency compared to their actual cost. I'm guessing an inherently 2 cost ability might end up needing anywhere from 2.5-6 from the reserves if it is an acquired ability, with the higher end being it done badly. Actually, maybe blood magic is minimum cost too, I can't remember for sure and can't remember where exactly nobody103 mentioned these things. The wordpress page's comments?

              There's also a risk of permanent soul damage, again depending on the quality of the enhancement ritual.

              But I agree, Zach, and to a far lesser extent, Zorian would benefit from enhancement rituals, but I kinda doubt it will go down that route too much. It would be interesting if Zach decided he needed 40 or so improvements to up their success rate upon leaving the loop.
              ```

              - u/thrawnca:
                ```
                > I kinda doubt it would go down that route too much

                I, for one, will be very surprised if he doesn't copy Kael's soul sight at some point.

                Enhancements that can be largely duplicated with regular spells probably aren't worthwhile for ZZ, but abilities that can't be properly developed without innate talent are a different matter.
                ```

    - u/Xtraordinaire:
      ```
      I think he already did grow to ~40. His mind magic being a flat modifier (confirmed) is a good way to explain irregularities in his growth.

      But what about Zach?
      ```

- u/Fredlage:
  ```
  Well, pretty sure QI gate works via some poor sap's soul filling in as gate spirit. At least we know the simulacrum's wandering won't have been for naught, since they'll need to reach the other Bakora gates before using them.

  Okay, I’ve had a day to mull over this chapter. Here are some thoughts:


  **Immortal Eleven Theory**

  >…I heard there are people who gained great powers by binding the blood of primordials to themselves

  All this talk about the ancient blood of primordials has got me thinking. If the blood of Panaxeth can be used to give people shapeshifting abilities, what sort of properties do the bloods of other primordials have? In the worldbuilding blog /u/nobody103 recently mentioned that the Immortal Eleven “are a group of eleven mages that created and drank a potion of eternal youth,” but he seemed reluctant to talk about them any further. I wonder if the basis for the Immortal Eleven’s “potion” was actually the blood of another primordial (besides Panaxeth). Maybe when Zach and Zorian get around to visiting the other elementals, they will find that they are not the first humans seeking such information.

  Maybe, if the other elementals are unwilling to further cooperate with humans, they end up seeking out the Immortal Eleven for the location of another prison?

  This is, of course, all highly speculative. 

  **Primordial Prisons for Loop Escape**

  After some discussion with people here, I think it’s unlikely that the primordial prisons are duplicated in the copy world. They are instead anchored to both the real world and copy world simultaneously.

  Some compelling evidence for this conclusion is that the gods (who presumably built the Sovereign Gate) seem incapable of destroying the primordials (which is why they’re imprisoned). This is likely why the time loop is designed to terminate when a primordial is summoned. Destroying the copy world with a primordial roaming in it requires destroying the primordial in particular, which the gods (and by extension, the Gate) simply can’t do. I think Zach and Zorian will need to be extra careful while investigating the prisons. I think tricking the Gate into allowing a primordial into the copy world could break the looping mechanism. This would be extra bad since if they’re killed in this scenario, it’s effectively game over for them.

  **Second Date with Akoja**

  I’m disappointed that /u/nobody103 didn’t talk about the followup date that Zorian agreed to so that he could “give her employment materials.” Everybody seems to have forgotten about it already...
  ```

  - u/throwawayIWGWPC:
    ```
    It's underappreciated how nice some simple formatting makes everything.

    I agree that the inability to kill the primordials may be the nail in the coffin---it's unlikely they and their pocket dimensions are created and destroyed every loop if killing them in the first place was impossible.

    And I would very much like a follow-up on the dating life of Zorian's simulacra. I really love the character development chapters, although I believe the author is trying to balance the pacing, so it's always a hard call.
    ```

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    > seeking out the Immortal Eleven

    I'm pretty sure that they're already seeking one. Potions master, unusually well preserved, prefers to stay out of the spotlight and has apparently mastered an extremely rare field of magic to do so (implying long experience and vast skill)...
    ```

    - u/cathemeralman:
      ```
      Ooh, this is an interesting idea.

      The only mention of the Immortal Eleven in the story proper (so far as I can tell), is Taiven discussing Oganj in Chapter 16:
      > And I heard he killed two of the Immortal Eleven too.

      This made me think that the Immortal Eleven were a well-known group, with public identities. This comment also directly followed Kael's anecdote of Oganj annihilating an army sent to subjugate him, which made me think that the two who died were attached to said army, and that the Immortal Eleven had government ties. This could be me reading too much into a passing comment though. It is more than possible that not all members of the Immortal Eleven revealed themselves to the public, or that Silverlake has multiple identities (likely).

      I guess we'll just have to wait and see, presuming the story ends up incorporating them at all.
      ```

- u/notintractable:
  ```
  Wonder how they convinced all those scientists and professionals to analyze the gate while the city was being attacked, though?  I can't imagine they explained the time loop to all of them, right?
  ```

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    > I can't imagine they explained the time loop to all of them

    Xvim's instructions make it clear that they didn't. However, we've already seen that Alanic has significant influence in the military, so the soldiers aren't an issue. Presumably the specialists were simply hired to do a job and not to ask questions, with most of the payment being scheduled for after the fact :).

  ```

  - u/spanj:
    ```
    That's only if the Silent Doorway Adepts truly believe that Z&Z are looping. They still seem skeptical based on the conversation with Glittering River of Stars, and it's not rational from their viewpoint to ruin their source of economic strength based on conjecture.

    It will be a whole different story once they are fully convinced.
    ```

    - u/thrawnca:
      ```
      > only if the Silent Doorway Adepts truly believe

      Yeah. Handing over a Miasina gate code should do wonders for their credibility.
      ```

- u/WriterBen01:
  ```
  So, the Bakura gates are simpler than thought. They basically just consist of spellcasters making a gate together like Zorian and his copy did to Koth. The spellcasters are probably artificial and can contact each other in some way, probably similar to the telepathic relays (bigger range?).

  They work like phones and you need a phone number to contact another gate. The Aranae know the number, but not enough about how the machine works, so they are trying to input a phone number while wearing a boxing glove. Very hard to do, but it will succeed if you try often enough.

  It surprises me that they need so much crystalised mana to open the gate. Wouldn't ancient mages want the gates to be built somewhere they could cheaply open them?
  ```

  - u/TimTravel:
    ```
    If they're really artificial spellcasters then that means it's possible to create a soul. I suppose it's not surprising, since normal biological reproduction does it, but hopefully the souls don't mind being trapped in a Bakora gate forever.

    Maybe it's not a "proper" soul, so it requires an external mana source to cast and maintain its gate spell.
    ```

    - u/kaukamieli:
      ```
      If gods can make people, then ofc it's possible to create a soul. But it doesn't have to be a proper, perfect soul, it can be very bare bones, more akin to an AI they can teach to communicate and stuff, like for the Sovereign gate. The souls would not care any more than your butter passing robot... wait...
      ```

- u/thrawnca:
  ```
  It's kind of a shame that their grey hunter farming is being backgrounded. I didn't think that they really had it down to routine yet. But I have hope that we'll soon see them try a new scheme to actually bring it down with the eggs intact :). After all, Silverlake has now become a higher priority.
  ```

  - u/kaukamieli:
    ```
    Well, after using some of those potions they know better what it sees and how to kill it better.
    ```

    - u/throwawayIWGWPC:
      ```
      Yeah. I'm currently wondering if Zorian can make a spell that stills the air within a certain radius and have everyone flying around or something to rob the grey hunter of a primary sense.

      I'm very curious how they take it down!
      ```

      - u/thrawnca:
        ```
        I still think they could get a long way by disrupting its senses with flash-bangs so that it can't dodge everything so easily. There are plenty of spells, or grenades, that could bring it down if it weren't going all Matrix on them.
        ```

      - u/thrawnca:
        ```
        > have everyone flying around or something

        You do know that it senses air currents and mana, right? To the point where it can dodge *homing* magic missiles, and even managed to dodge a magical rope *while in midair*?
        ```

      - u/spanj:
        ```
        The problem I see here is that due to the grey hunter's superb magic sense it might be possible for the grey hunter to deem the area as a trap and thus remove itself from the area. Presumably the area under effect would be perfused with mana. 

        So in order to confuse it's physical senses by using magic you'd either have to have such a large area of effect that the grey hunter can't possibly escape in time or you'd have to overload its magic sense. Maybe the latter can be achieved by evaporating tons of crystallized mana.

        So flash bangs in the form of extreme ambient mana perfusion, ground tremors, and turbulent air.

        I think one thing Z&Z are overlooking is simple biology. Spiders are cold blooded and become less active in the cold. Even warm blooded animals don't function as well in the cold. Simply cast a large area of effect spell to lower the temperature such that the eggs are still intact but that biological reactions take longer to propagate. Think stiffer muscles, slower propagation of neuronal signals, etc.
        ```

- u/OchreOgre_AugerAugur:
  ```
  Are they actually contacting a spirit of they gate that is completely undetectable when not in use or are they creating a temporary one each time they perform the ritual?  Maybe the gates are inert because the network's central control system went offline for some reason, and they are just temporarily animating their gate and the destination node.

  Should the gate really be somewhere without sufficient ambient mana to power it?  Perhaps there was once a large well nearby, but it has been diverted to somewhere else.
