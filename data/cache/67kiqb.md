  >I miss being able to just toss out ideas as posts and actively discuss them. I still visit for discussion of various web serials, but a lot of the initial draw of the sub has been lost. The closest thing to what I'm talking about might be the power munchkinry threads on /r/parahumans, where you take a concept, sometimes inane, and run with it to find cool usages and ideas.

  So here's the spreadsheet! Got some tabs at the bottom where I've created some pivot tables and charts and what not! I also have a chart where all of the comments have been placed into their own little pivot table. 

  Only issue is formatting for that last section where I asked you guys what your favorite part of the sub was. Because I'm a dumbass, I put checkboxes instead of multiple choice to give you guys a~~n illusion of~~ choice. And because I'm a super dumbass, I put commas in some of the checkbox answers. So there goes my plan of just splitting them up with commas as a delimiter!

  I've changed the questions so that they use hyphens instead of commas in them but any data before row 353, which I've highlighted in green, may not be incorporated into the table I'm planning to make, marking out people's favorites. If any of you guys are excel wizards and have suggestions on how to somehow format the data to be usable in my sheet without deleting any inputs, I'd be very grateful.

  >Doxxing myself, but I quit for a while once one of our mods advocated violence.  Glad to see r/rational leadership pass back intto my personal overtone window.

  Surprisingly not me, since I was one of the people who raised a stink about that more vocally.

    I'm confused by both that comment and your reply, lol. Care to expand? If not, that's fine too :)

      I did not make that comment in the the survey. I did complain about the mod/event in question quite a bit, which could lead one to assume that I made the comment.

      Not that it really matters all that much.

      One of the mods was going around with flair saying "bash the fash", which made apparently more than just me uncomfortable.

        That's it? I was hoping for some more juicy /r/subredditdrama than that. :(

        I guess I missed that.  But why does he hate [western Iranians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fash) so much?  ^;)
