  ```
  [Seventh Horcrux](http://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/seventh-horcrux-thread-2-a-harry-situation.311264/) - The presenceÂ of a foreign soul may have unexpected side effects on a growing child.

  Here are some fanfics I've enjoyed:

  Narnia:

  1. [Chanson de Geste](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5615090/1/Chanson-de-Geste) by LVDB is my all-time favorite, a Narnia fanfic that presents a more realistic view of Narnia based on medieval history and politics and focuses on the ghost of the White Witch, Jadis, haunting Edmund. It even manages to make you like Jadis while not undermining her status as a genocidal villain.

  Harry Potter:

  1. The [Alexandra Quick](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/AlexandraQuick) series takes place after the events of Harry Potter, but in Magical America. The cast is all OCs, but the story is great and makes good use of its setting with plenty of references to American history.

  Zero no Tsukaima/Familiar of Zero:

  1. [Emperor of Zero](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7736264/1/Emperor-of-Zero) is a Zero no Tsukaima fic in which Louise summoned Napoleon Bonaparte instead of Saito, resulting in a story that focuses more on politics and military strategy. Yudkowsky has recommended it in one of the HPMOR author notes.

  My Little Pony:

  1. [Night's Favored Child](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/5523/nights-favoured-child) is an MLP alternate universe fic in which Nightmare Moon won against Celestia long ago and rules Equestria, which hasn't seen the sun in thousands of years. Twilight becomes her student.

  2. [Blueblood: Hero of Equestria](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/55377/blueblood-hero-of-equestria
  ) is an MLP fic where Prince Blueblood is forced into being an officer in a war with the Changelings. He's selfish and cowardly and doesn't really want to fight, but he ends up doing some pretty heroic things because he's not as stupid or stubborn as the military higher-ups. This fics has really engaging narration and does a good job of making Blueblood likeable.

  Avatar: the Last Airbender:

  1. [Gilded Green](http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7108225/1/) is an Avatar: the Last Airbender fanfic about how the Dai Li capture and brainwash Lu Ten after the Battle of Ba Sing Se. The brainwashing is chilling and is balanced well by the portrayal of the Dai Li as humans with families and ambitions that they are willing to do horrible things for.

  2. [The Problem with Zuko](http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3036180/1/
  ) and [When All Your Dreams Come True](http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6360866/1/) are excellent, unrelated-but-similar oneshots about the Avatar from Avatar: The Last Airbender being captured by the Fire Nation/by Zuko and Zuko realizing that that is not a good thing.

  3. [His Father's Son](http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4845588/1/) is a oneshot about Zuko from Avatar: The Last Airbender learning to rule the Fire Nation. Some of the plotline might seem familiar, but it was actually written long before the comics were released.

  Madoka Magica:

  1. [To The Stars](http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7406866/1/To-the-Stars) is a Madoka Magica fanfic that takes place four hundred years in the future, where magical girls have come out of hiding to help fight an alien invasion of human worlds. This fic has a lot of excellent worldbuilding and an interesting story. 

  Code Geass/Elfen Lied:

  1. [Galton's Children](http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5327665/1/) is a Code Geass/Elfen Lied crossover. It's also written by LVDB and has really good dialogue.

  2. [Lelouch of Britannia](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3816236/1/Lelouch-of-Britannia) is probably the most popular Code Geass fic, and for good reason. It's an AU where Lelouch wasn't exiled from Britannia and has some well-written battle scenes. Updates are very slow, though.

  Bartimaeus:


  1. [A Day in the Life](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3854897/1/A-Day-in-the-Life) is a Bartimaeus Trilogy fic set in an AU without magic. Bartimaeus is a human bookstore owner and Nathaniel is his employee. Kitty is a waitress at the cafe across the street. Unlike some modern AU stories, it has an actual plot: Nathaniel overhears Simon Lovelace, a politican, doing something shady and is put in danger because of it. The dialogue and narration are great, which is essential for a Bartimaeus fic. It's slow-paced at first, but the humor and dialogue keep it entertaining even then.

  Animorphs:

  1. [Sacred Host](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3464631/1/Sacred-Host) is about a Yeerk who infests a religious young Christian girl and is influenced by her faith. I know a lot of people here aren't particularly fond of religion, but this story is well-written and quite funny.

  2. [Out of the Blue Box](http://archiveofourown.org/works/93341/chapters/127330) is a sort-of-munchkiny Animorphs fic about transgender people post-series who use or choose not to use the morphing technology to permanently morph into the opposite sex.
  ```

- u/Kishoto:
  ```
  [Embers](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5398503/1/Embers) is an AtlA fanfic. It is ridiculously good. It expands on the spirituality of the series in a believable way. Starts slow, but rapidly picks up the pace.

  [A Matter of Honor](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4381366/1/A-Matter-of-Honor) is another good AtlA fanfic. Not very serious, light hearted and believable Taang and Zutara. Plays with the series' spirituality as well, in a unique way.

  [Time and Again](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4041754/1/Time-and-Again) is a Naruto time-travel fic handled pretty well. It's fairly old, and the sequel was never finished, but it's worth a standalone read. The twist ending's also pretty amazing.

  [Naruto: Ouroboros](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7415078/1/Naruto-Ouroboros) An AU where Orochimaru didn't leave the village, Naruto was born eight years before the Kyuubi's attack and becomes his apprentice and his little sister's the jinchuuriki. Very well written.

  [Kenchi](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2218705/Kenchi618) is a prolific Naruto fanfiction writer. I would highly recommend all of his fics (although the older ones are not as good) He does Naruto crossover ridiculously well. He made NarutoxStreet Fighter WORK.

  [A Protector's Pride](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5002293/1/A-Protector-s-Pride) is a Bleach fanfic that's really good. It's a retelling of canon after a certain point. Nothing's drastically different, at first, it's just grittier and more well written. This butterflies into AU later. Wouldn't suggest going into it without prior Bleach knowledge, at least up to when Ichigo meets the Vizard.


  General tip for the noobie fanfiction viewer as well: On fanfiction.net, I suggest sorting by reviews and going from the top down in whatever category you please. Obviously, not all top reviewed stories are AMAZING but you can usually find some of the best of the bunch in at least the top 30-40 in any fandom you can name.

Amon is replaced with a different character, but that's about as far as characters are changed. Much fun.
  - The Son of Suns Trilogy: [Into the Storm](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4302076/1/Into-the-Storm) is what happens when Vader captures Luke after Cloud City and turns him over to the Emperor. This doesn't end well.

He's ready to be kiled by his dragon, but then something magical happens. Elements of HP and DRoP, with many OC characters and a heavy helping of judiciously-applied justice. NSFW chapter disclaimers, but no smut, and all sex is off-screen.

With the Endbringers and other parahumans being played by magical artifacts. Hermoine gets Dragon. **IN PROGRESS**
  - [This Bouletcorp comic](http://english.bouletcorp.com/2014/11/04/its-a-kind-of-magic/).

Not a pleasant fic, about 0.75 *Worm* in terms of gruesome. Invents a lot of things.  
  Warnings: grimdark, torture, various injuries, sex unpleasant magic, Harry/Fleur, **Finished** with a cliffhanger and a [sequel](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6325846/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Heartlands-of-Time).

  ### Marvel, DC, and suchlike:

  - [In Which Tony Stark Builds Himself Some Friends (But His Family Was Assigned by Nick Fury)](https://archiveofourown.org/series/18228): Tony Stark does his usual depressed/bonkers thing and builds an AI toaster with wheels. The Avengers live in his tower. Very funny, lots of hijinks, and oh by the way it's Tony/Cap Coulson/Hawkeye m/m slashfic.  
  Warnings: mental illness, homosexual couplings, Tony/Captain, Coulson/Hawkeye, kidnapping
  - Really [anything by Scifigrl47](https://archiveofourown.org/users/scifigrl47/pseuds/scifigrl47/works), the author of the above series. She mostly uses Marvel Cinematic Universe characters.
  - [Wand and Shield](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8177168/1/Wand-and-Shield): Harry gets dropped in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, right in front of Agent Romanov, just as Tony Stark goes missing in Afghanistan. Deviates from movie plot, accelerates many things.

  More NGE: 
  - [NGE: Nobody Dies](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5579457/1/NGE-Nobody-Dies): a rewrite of the series, where you'll be surprised to hear that none of the main characters die permanently. At times dark and messed up, lots of body modification, some downright disturbing accidents, and any sort of canon plot progression just got thrown out the window. **Long and unfinished**. Author wrote a lot of side-stories.

  ### Specifically time loops: 

  - [The Finale of the Ultimate Meta Mega Crossover](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5389450/1/The-Finale-of-the-Ultimate-Meta-Mega-Crossover): Pretty much what it says on the box; starts in the Vernor Vinge's *[A Fire Upon The Deep](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Fire_Upon_the_Deep)* and spoils its ending.  
  Warnings: people who don't like contemplating living in The Matrix, **Finished**
  - [How to Train Your Dragon Loops](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7305602/1/HTTYD-Loops): covers a whole lot of universes. Occasional crossovers with MLP, frequent crossovers with *Dragonriders of Pern*. Spoilers for HTTYD2. **Occasionally updated**.

  - [Awesome Gendo](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7449830/1/Awesome-Gendo): More Evangelion, but pure crack.

  - [The My Little Pony Loops](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9216685/1/MLP-Loops): Say what you will about MLP and bronies, these loops are pretty awesome. Cross-loop character development is fantastic, and the crack loops are well-balanced. Excellent example of the potential of The Infinite Loops. Updates every few weeks.

    Thank you so much for your list! You know, when I was thinking about this thread I was thinking exactly about people like you - who have been reading a lot of fanfiction and have the same interests like I do - personally I think yours is the best response in this thread. I'll be coming back frequently here over the year whenever I'll be in a need of a fic, because your response is so good - so much new stuff to check out! Thank you once again ;)

  Anything marked with a (u) is unfinished, but they all are worth reading IMO. As a warning, Bond is Drarry slashfic, it is just a really good one.

    Thanks for the reminder of 'Here be Dragons' - I forgot to include that in my list, it was so good, especially [Spoiler](/s "The fight between Eidolon and Taylor") - it was really only one of a few scenarios where it'd work well  . Sadly I couldn't get into 'An Imago of Rust And Crimson' despite 3 separate attempts. Security and Zenith were kind of meh for me, but I'll definitely read 'When a Lioness fights' and I don't mind the Drarry slashfic - especially when it's well done, like it was in [Again and Again] (https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8149841/1/Again-and-Again).

    Sadly I couldn't get into any Naruto fanfiction I've found as well - and I've tried at least 5 separate stories.

      Have you tried Team 8? If you can't get into that, I guess you wont like any Narufic. It is exceptionally written IMO.

      Thanks for Again and Again, somehow never noticed it (I'm not really a slashfic reader which is probably why, but I will read anything if it is good).

  [Pokemon: The Sun Soul](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5367085/1/The-Sun-Soul) is my all time favorite fanfic. It's ALMOST a rational fic, the world is realistic and brutal and the characters, while I wouldn't call them exactly rational, are often very smart. I cannot recommend this one enough. Also, it's finished, and it has an ongoing sequel in [Foundations of the World](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10539516/3/Foundations-of-the-World)

  **Harry Potter:**

  [Harry Potter and the Battle of Wills](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2009130/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Battle-of-Wills)
  Really good alternate Book 6+7 (before the release of either), and a wonderful characterisation of Severus.

  **Star Wars:**

  [The Shadow of Vader](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2897153/1/The-Shadow-of-Vader)
  Don't let the fact it's not "Published" deceive you - it's just lacking a planned epilogue, so the story is completed and in a very satisfying way. Best SW fanfic I've read. It's an alternate universe diverging from ROTS where Obi-Wan becomes Darth Vader.

  [Fall of the Sith](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2945228/1/Fall-of-the-Sith) & [Descent into the Dark](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2987152/1/Descent-Into-The-Dark)
  Absolutely brilliant AU diverging from ROTS where Mace Windu kills Palpatine. Has a prequel (which works with canon) set hundreds of years before that tells the story of Yoda's touch with the dark side (and explains how come Yoda knows so much about the Sith in Episode I).

  **Star Wars EU:**

  [Legacy of the Sith](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/gvdfqocb976an44/-W4fVfxqbf) This is a series of eight books. Technically, Legacy of the Sith is books 5-8, with 1-3 being an AU of New Jedi Order. *However,* it's not entirely necessary to read 1-3 (or the intervening short fic 4), nor to know much about the EU - I started reading book 5 (Age of Heroes) and understood everything in short order even without reading any of the post-movie EU (just relied on Wookieepedia to fill in gaps), and it was so brilliant it actually got me into reading the EU!
