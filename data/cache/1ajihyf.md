## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  Recently [Theodicy [DiscovAres] [F/Z] [SI]](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/theodicy-fate-zero-si-caster.125134/) had just finished it's first half, so I guess its about time I stop procrastinating and recommends what I've been reading. It's a pretty good SI fic, and I particularly like how it started from another character's perspective and continues to switch back and forth between SI's pov and another characters in the following chapters. Another fic I read in the past that does similar thing is [Forbid/Forget [Chairtastic] [Dragon's Age] [SI]](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/forbid-forget-dragon-age-si.958637/), which might outright never had an SI's pov, and instead only from the surrounding characters.

  Theodicy's blurb:

  > Summoned into the body of the infamous murderer, Gilles de Rais, Caster of the Fourth Holy Grail War, destined to bring devastation and suffering to the city of Fuyuki, our protagonist attempts to chart a way back home, away from the dangerous and unpredictable world of Fate. But each Servant must have a Master, and so, our unfortunate SI must ally with an ambitious young mage, whose goals only apparently align with his own.

  Last month I also read some more Youjo Senki fics, and the ones that stand out was [A Young Girl's Delinquency Record [Gremlin Jack] [Youjo Senki]](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-young-girls-delinquency-record-youjo-senki-saga-of-tanya-the-evil.788149/) and [A Young Girl's Criminal Record [Robo Jesus] [Youjo Senki] [Worm]](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-young-girls-criminal-record-youjo-senki-worm-au.1017039/). The former I described in my note as "A globe-spanning game of cat-and-mouse-and-misunderstanding, where Tanya inadvertently causes the Great Depression." Pretty great, although I kinda put it on hold in the middle and haven't picked it up again since. The latter is about poor Tattletale being the psychotherapist of a more unstable Tanya >!who had just lost Visha before transmigrating over (spoilered but I forgot if its really a spoiler or not)!<. It's awesome.

  Request: Any good self-insert, OC-insert, or crossover-insert that's like, *really* long? Recently I've only been reading new fics that had just gone over my arbitrary 100k threshold, and I'm kinda craving for a fic that I can chew on for a *long* time. If nothing forthcoming maybe I'll pick up [The Divine Hunter [隐约点] [Witcher 3] [SI]](https://reaperscans.com/novels/5172-the-divine-hunter) again, which had piled up a juicy over-700k-words of updates since I last read it.
  ```

  - u/Naitra:
    ```
    You sir seem like a connoisseur of self-insert and oc-insert fics.

    I'll give these below recommendations in the hopes that I can get some recommendations back from you

    [Occult Classic](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/occult-classic-d-d-pathfinder-historical-si.831491/) A regular person transmigrates into the BC period of Earth with a pathfinder system.

    [A Young Vampire's Everyday Life (Hellsing Historical SI)
    ](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-young-vampires-everyday-life-hellsing-historical-si.744079/) A regular person transmigrates into the Roman Republic, in an Earth that is precursor to the Hellsing Ultimate anime series.

    [A Young Girl's Game of Thrones](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-young-girls-game-of-thrones.1095557/) Tanya in ASOIAF as Myrcella. Very compelling

    [Harry Evans and the well-lived death (Harry Potter SI)](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/68260/harry-evans-and-the-well-lived-death-harry-potter) Harry is the son of Lily and someone else? James Potter is alive and is an Auror? What happened to canon? Entertaining as the SI tries to figure out what the hell happened while furthering his magical education.

    [A Harry Potter Quest: He who was not](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/a-harry-potter-quest-he-who-was-not.47920/) Not an insert, but the very interesting OC as well as the deeper look at magic makes this a fascinating read.

    [Legends Never Die (Ahistorical/CKIII Gamer)](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/legends-never-die-ahistorical-ckiii-gamer.1030193/) Historical OC with a Crusader Kings system. Scratches the same itch as the oc-insert fics for me.

    You've probably already read some of the really good and popular ongoing SIs such as Ghost in the City and High Tide, so I'm not recommending them.

      As the proofreader for A Young Girl's Game of Thrones, I'm always delighted to see it mentioned here!

      Now, to give my comment an actual reason for existence, and fitting in the vein of fairly long, although more portal fantasy than fan-fiction, I've recently enjoyed [Markets and Multiverses](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/61244/markets-and-multiverses-a-serial-transmigration/). Basically, serial transmigration, but with an overarching plot where the protagonist and her friends have to grow strong over their lives quickly to get new lives from the place between lives that has been attacked and is being held by strange entities hostile to transmigrators way out of their weight class.

      Similarly, [Elydes](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/67742/elydes) is simple but good fun about a guy trying to get good at magic in his second life, even if (mild spoilers) >!the neighbouring empire thinks that his paradise island home is better used as a tourist resort, and the indigenous people don't really need all that space or even food!<.

      I also occasionally enjoy catching up on [Applying Exotic Metaphysics for Fun and Profit](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/applying-exotic-metaphysics-for-fun-and-profit-elder-scrolls-oc-i.1021125/), which is an SI that explores the Elder Scrolls magic system in interesting ways. Only 140k words though
      ```

      - u/serge_cell:
        ```
        I support " Applying Exotic Metaphysics" recommendation. The last part magic battles depictions are awesome, like someone explaining  Grothendieck topology to 5-year old with pictures. There is a lot of *deep* TES lore referenced though, some small experience with Bethesda games is not helping at all, prepare to do some googling if you risk to read it...
        ```

    - u/greenweird:
      ```
      Some I've already read and is following (A Young Girl's Game of Thrones, Legend Never Die), some kinda was in my radar but fell of the list without me giving them a proper go (Occult Classic, High Tide), and some I've never heard (A Young Vampire's Life, harry potter ones) partly because I'm not too big into HP but your description of them seems plenty interesting. Gonna give them all a shot.

      [Ghost in the City](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/ghost-in-the-city-cyberpunk-gamer-si.1046809/) I have read before and mildly enjoyed it but eventually became bored by it. Maybe I'll pick this up again too, since it has over 100 new chapters since I last read it.
      ```

    - u/abcishere:
      ```
      If you liked Occult Classic and A Young Vampire's Everyday Life, the author has another work called [shieldmaiden](https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/shieldmaiden-ahistorical-ck3-si.13178/) on qq that I found just as enjoyable.

    >  crossover-insert that's like, really long

    [Ghost in the Flesh](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/ghost-in-the-flesh-worm-love-death-and-robots-complete.819108/) is a complete crossover where Sonny, the beast from [that one Love Death and Robots short film](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLOSJ5LDuEE) is tossed into Earth Bet's Philadelphia, just as Faultline's Crew is running a job there.

      Seconding, read this today and it was definitely one of the better worm fics I've read. Unique perspective and writing that feels much like wildbow in the later arcs of worm. Good example of found family done well
      ```

- u/CaramilkThief:
  ```
  I sort of recommend [Bog Standard](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/69512/bog-standard-isekai-a-litrpg-progression-fantasy). It's good and solid, but there are some things that this subreddit would dislike. It's about Mark, who gets transported to another world in the body of a child, alone in a village in the middle of a bog. 

  At first it's about Mark's struggles to survive and learn about the new world. Later on Mark joins another Bog as an official citizen, and then we learn about the small town politics and lives in the new Bog. What I like about this story is that it does "bog standard" things well (and yes the pun is used multiple times in the story on multiple levels). The story is pretty simple, it's about Mark's growth in the new world using the system and his advantages and connections. The adult characters have depth and actually use their powers well. The main plot involving national level politics and actors also has depth. The system is well thought out and the powers it gives are nothing groundbreaking but make sense within the setting. 

  What I liked most of all is that the story hits the right balance of making Mark (later called Brin, due to a hilarious mistake) feel like a person. Mark is sometimes an adult in the body of a child, and sometimes a child who has some adult memories. It's confusing and difficult, and he slowly learns to deal with it by being something in the middle. 

  There are problems to the story too. One of the arcs later on takes too long, and imo the resolution didn't feel as satisfactory as it could've. Some of the emotional beats are a bit wonky, like it gets very close to not feeling like an authentic character reaction but it also doesn't? But overall it's solid and good.

    I disliked Bog Standard, and I’ll lightly de-recc it. It’s tough to explain but it felt like the author doesn’t respect their audience. There’s a character engineered to draw as much hate as possible from readers, and the natural curiousity about what class the MC is going to end up with is milked for like fifty chapters. This is a very fuzzy thing but I had the palpable impression that the author was more concerned with using engagement tactics than telling a good story. Just felt gross. I understand this could just be a weird personal thing but I thought it worth mentioning.
    ```

    - u/TheColourOfHeartache:
      ```
      I find it weird how much hate the weaver (I presume that's whom you reference) gets.

      I'm not saying she is a good person, or made the correct judgement call, but she was acting to save lives and her actions make sense given the information she has to work with. I've seen protagonists in the genre do worse things for worse reasons (usually revenge). 

      If anything I think Hogg comes off that whole conflict looking worse than she did. She was doing bad things because she had genuine reasons to believe they were a necessary evil. Hogg let those bad things happen by refusing to even acknowledge the problem when Brin directly told him of it because of his preconceptions.
      ```

      - u/Kaljinx:
        ```
        True, I felt like for the first time I saw an 'evil' character I could truly see and understand the actions of, especially as of chapter 42 once she explains how much she sees.

        It did not justify her actions, I am sure she has her own personal bias (especially with her desire to do everything to for mainly >!good of her daughter!<) and incorrect thoughts that she refuses to fix and consider while also choosing shitty ways to do things, but it seems like the situation itself was convoluted.
        ```

    - u/DRMacIver:
      ```
      Another light derecc - I think these things were more tolerable when I was reading it as an archive binge, but after a while reading it on regular updates it acquired a... not exactly gross feeling, but very unsatisfiying like I wasn't getting very much out of it.
      ```

    - u/sephirothrr:
      ```
      > the author doesn’t respect their audience

      > Just felt gross.

      i'm glad someone else shares this - i was feeling this the whole time but the praise otherwise seemed very positive so i just assumed i was being way too critical, but now i'm vindicated
      ```

  - u/TheColourOfHeartache:
    ```
    I like this one a lot, I wouldn't call it rational but its a very solid implementation of an Isekai litrpg with good writing, characters, and a solid magic system. 

    Its kinda nice to see gods who aren't jerks in the genre too. They're only a small part of the setting but seem to be fundamentally decent. The reason they brought him to this world being >!they had an opportunity to help him when he was dying and nothing more!< was cool.
    ```

  - u/megazver:
    ```
    I like it. 

    I like it as a story in itself. I am also very amused by the visceral reaction some webserial/litrpg readers have to standard fiction tools of 'MC suffers a setback', 'MC doesn't exactly get what they thought they wanted', 'an antagonist actually succeeds at something', etc. At this point reading the comments whenever something like this happens is extra entertainment value.
    ```

    - u/TheColourOfHeartache:
      ```
      The amount of readers having a reaction to the MC being forced to >!take a specific class just to survive the next hour!< and claiming this was the author not giving his protagonist agency was quite amusing. The solution to the problem was clearly established in advance, and the MC used it at the first opportunity, textbook agency.

  Discovered Apocalypse Parenting last week thanks to /u/EdLincoln6

  Really enjoyed it, it's a litrpg about a mother and three children surviving after aliens decided to use Earth for a reality television show (similar to Dungeon Crawler Carl, slightly less unfair).

  Characters are well fleshed out, the children actually behave like children (bright children for sure but not unbelievably so). The main character tends to think things through and make good decisions.

  I have a kid and I can relate a lot with the interactions between the mother and the children.

  World building is quite good and the author does a good job in imagining how different group of people react to different situations.

  Sometimes it feels that the MC is slightly too competent (or maybe a bit too lucky) but that's par for the course in this type of stories. 

  Honestly was a great surprise.

  There's a spinoff Engineer's Odyssey about the father, an aerospace engineer, trying to get back to his family from his business trip. It's good but not as good as Apocalypse Parenting. The characters just don't feel as fleshed out. It's fun though to see them think things through from the point of view of engineers.
  ```

  - u/NTaya:
    ```
    Seconding Apocalypse Parenting. I read it in ongoing back when there were only ten chapters or so. It's really good, especially in terms of character writing. Realistic children that are nonetheless a joy to read? This book might be one of a kind!

    One thing DCC obviously does better is setting up mysteries and pay-offs. AP has some cliffhangers and short-term goals, but they weren't juggled as masterfully as in DCC. I stopped reading somewhere around Book 3 due to losing interest, but this is by no means a de-rec. I think reading the story in bulk as opposed to in bi-weekly updates might be just the cure for losing interest.
    ```

    - u/tomtan:
      ```
      Yes, I'd say that DCC feels bigger scale, more chaotic and with great pay offs (plus the world building is a lot crazier).

      Apocalypse Parenting though is very bingeable, I'm not sure it'd be that good when reading weekly updates.

  I just stumbled on this rec of Graydon Saunders, which immediately made it jump to the top of my readpile: 

  >I want to give a strong rec here for Graydon Saunders, whose commonweal series is quite unlike almost anything else in Fantasy. It's perfect for fans of Gene Wolfe and John M. Ford and C. J. Cherryh and like your fantasy worldbuilding extremely chewy.

  Read the full rec here, it sounds like quite the experience:

    ```
    Seconding this, at least The March North, as I haven't read further yet. Definitely read this at about half your normal pace, and maybe reread the first half of the book again after finishing. Its very readable, but dense and full of world specific jargon, so a second pass gets a lot more meaning than just the surface level actions. (a lot of actions taken have reasoning and tradition behind them that isn't immediately apparent on first read) Even if you don't catch all the subtlety the first time around its still entertaining, and you can tell its at least internally consistent if not a little obscured.
    ```

    - u/Nick_named_Nick:
      ```
      Definitely listen to this advice if you decide to pick up the first book. I had to put this down after struggling for like 30 minutes to read the beginning bits of this book. It’s not a Tuesday night wind down, brain-switched-off kind of read.
      ```

  - u/N0_B1g_De4l:
    ```
    I started reading the second book based on that recommendation, actually (I read the first one a bit back). So far it's pretty enjoyable. It's a magic school story in a world where magic is *incredibly* lethal (both for the mage and everyone around them), and the education is treated with a corresponding seriousness.

          This is his only sentence in the post mentioning "extermination".

          1. extermination.  This is the most expensive option; given that it's patriarchal white supremacy, don't bet against the consensus of the matrons going for this in a few years as the demographics shift.  But as a political plan it's not helpful.

          I would hardly interpret it as an endorsement for genocide given that he is outright saying it isn't a valid political plan.

          - u/chiruochiba:

            Also note that he put the obviously bogus 'extermination' route in option 1, but a few paragraphs later he explicitly said he preferred the other options 2 & 3.

            People labeling this author as "endorses extermination" are the equivalent of the people who claim that Jonathan Swift endorses baby eating after they skim read [A Modest Proposal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Modest_Proposal).

          Huh. To be honest, I expected exaggeration and taking something out of context. But no, it's as bad as it sounded, maybe even worse. I'm definitely in the "separate art from the artist" camp—but reading something, even a pirated copy, and then discussing/recommending it *is* supporting the author if the author is sufficiently small and thus still cares about these things. I totally understand unwillingness to participate in the fandom after that.
