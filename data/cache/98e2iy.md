  I had a lot written, but if I'm being honest, I've rehashed this argument so many times I'm sick of it. Go to /r/DebateAnAtheist, or visit www.lesswrong.com and start a thread about it, or go to www.slatestarcodex.com and post in the latest open thread about it. /r/rational is for discussing rational fiction, not rationalism. (for reference, the last two are rationalist and the first one is just very likely to give you a similar answer)

  What exactly "seems shortsighted" about life not continuing after death? What actual evidence do you have to support the idea that reincarnation exists in any form?

  I think samsara is an appealing concept, for me as well as, apparently, for you. But there's no evidence for it, just feelings. The only evidence for samsara would be the unlikeliness of living this life (yours or mine) here at all. Unfortunately, that can more or less be explained by the anthropic principle...if we didn't exist, we wouldn't be here thinking how unlikely it is that we didn't exist.

  A better path to go down, I think, is the negation of self. If you can internalize the idea that there is no "you," no hard line between you and everything else around you, then you've just extended your life expectancy quite a bit, because the universe isn't going anywhere for awhile. Kind of hard to stay in that mode and actually live, though.

  You're blatantly overusing and misusing the phrase "doesn't make sense". I can't even understand what you mean by it. It seems to me that you use "doesn't make sense" for whatever doesn't aesthetically please you. 

  But whether that's what you mean or not, I suggest tabooing that phrase. By "doesn't make sense", what *exactly* do you mean. What exact conditions would an AI have to check to verify whether an idea/theory/concept 'makes sense' or not?
