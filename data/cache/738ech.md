## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  Weekly update on the [hopefully rational](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11QAh61C8gsL-5KbdIy5zx3IN6bv_E9UkHjwMLVQ7LHg/edit?usp=sharing) roguelike [immersive sim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbyTOAlhRHk) Pokemon Renegade, as well as the associated engine and tools.

  I got the itch to keep working on compiler-related modding stuff, so I kept working on that.  The basic idea is to replicate the dynamic parts of Supreme Commander’s modding engine while staying firmly within compiler-enforced object-oriented land.  

  In SupCom, you could mod the core game files (and other mods) by simply indicating that your mod was to load later than the mods in question, and then provide a script that overwrote the particular functions (or classes or variables) that you wanted.  The way that this was handled meant that each mod that touched that function would be evaluated in turn: first the core version would be loaded and its version of function `Foo` evaluated, and then ModA would load and perform its modification to `Foo`, all the way down to ModZ that would have the final say on what `Foo` looked like.  For something like functions, this whole process was more or less pointless, since the function wasn’t actually *used* until some code later referenced it, so the last version was all that mattered.

  In other cases, however, this process turned out to be surprisingly valuable.  For instance, a dictionary variable that saves something such as keybindings could be affected by multiple mods during this process.  Core would run and populate it with all the base game keybinds, and then ModA could load and add one or two keys, and then ModB would load and add a few more, and so on and so forth.  This could be problematic if mods didn’t play nice, and this particular case of a keybinding library would probably be better served by a concept such as a registry, but it was so *fascinating*, watching the Rube Goldberg-like cascading of modifications to a particular object.

  There was one more feature that I felt was super useful, and that was how function hooks were handled.  Hooking into a function is basically a polite way of saying you hijacked it, with the entity calling the function none the wiser that you have usurped authority.  In SupCom, since Lua is a dynamic scripting language, you could save the entire function pointer of a function to a variable, then redefine that function, calling the saved original as needed.  Like so:

      local sneakylocalcopy = ImportantFunction

      function ImportantFunction()

      #I can perform my own code here

          sneakylocalcopy () #calling the original version of the function

          # and here I can do even more of my own stuff

      end

  This was *so powerful*.  Yes, you could easily destabilize the game by hooking the wrong functions, but it was *so nice* to be able to inject code wherever you needed to, if you needed to.  I wanted to duplicate this functionality within C#, in XGEF.

  The means by which I will do this is to have a series of [Attributes] that functions or classes can be tagged with.  As a preprocessing step, XGEF analyzes any given script, finds the attributes that are important to it, and then transforms the code accordingly.  

  If we have a function Foo in some other mod (or in the core game) that we want to slap a few extra lines on, it can be done like so:

      [Append]

      public void Foo()

      {

          DoSomethingSpecial();

      }

  And that’s it.  XGEF sees the `[Append]` tag, looks up the original version of `Foo()`, copies the whole of it into the file, and then ensures that the modder’s latest addition is included.  Successive uses of Append can be used by multiple mods, letting everyone get their grubby fingers where they need to.

  (As an aside, I’m well aware that probably about 80% of the problems that *could* be solved this way *shouldn’t* be.  XGEF will have extensive support for registries and event handling, which more elegantly solves problems that most of what this code transformation can, but at the end of the day there are some problems that require you to reach down into the pit of the game’s source code and tear it apart with your own bare hands. I intend this to be an option to those who need it.)

  The total number of tags that I want to include is around 10, ranging from `[Overwrite]` to `[Extend]` to a small number of tags that deal with making event generation boilerplate easy.  

  So anyway, I spent the better part of this week working on really making Roslyn flex its muscles and getting comfortable analyzing code files.  I ended up spending the last two or so days writing an intermediary set of classes, since it turns out that Roslyn can actually be unwieldy for some of the things I need it to do.  But as of right now, I have a means of analyzing a C# file, turning it into my intermediary `ScriptFile`, and regenerating the original source file. Now that I have this, I can use it to regenerate the original slightly differently, which is all I really need for the code transformation to work. 

  This next week I plan on  implementing the remaining attributes (one and a half are done already, mostly done before ScriptFile was written).  Once those are done (or at least Overwrite and Extend), I can finally collapse the call stack and get back to writing the core mod in the way I wanted to two weeks ago.

  1. Shouldn’t the investigation and practice of 2 or less daily hours of sleep be considered as an example of real-life munchkining? 1.2.

    What's the latest word on the long-term health effects of different sleep schedules? e.g. something more recent than [this](https://www.supermemo.com/en/articles/polyphasic2010)? What's the risk of eventually suffering from the effects of chronic sleep deprivaton, or actually dozing off periodically untracked, or whatever?

    This might be very obvious to you, but what works in stories and tabletop RPGs doesn't work in real life.

    Most stories emphasize ideas and uniqueness over logistics and comparative advantage. The protagonist doesn't train 10% harder or dabble in a few different skills, he trains 3000% harder and learns The Ultimate Technique of Doing [the goal] Right. I'd argue that in real life, success is way less about good ideas than about good habits.

    And personally, when I don't sleep enough I lose all my motivation and I have a way harder time concentrating.

  Any advice on how to broach conversation with extremely introverted people? I am in the process of reforming my school's Science Olympiad team and I came across someone who would be a perfect candidate, if only he ever talked to anyone. 
  1. We had an oral test in my Chinese class, and as he is a native speaker he has no reasonable chance of failing. I jokingly asked him how he fancies his chance of passing, and he proceeded to explain in great detail the recent immigration of his parents and how he was raised on the tongue, etc.
  2. I was joking around with a classmate about the age of the Earth being 6000 years, and he turns around and quietly gives not only the correct approximate values for the age of the universe and the earth, and also how they were calculated. I explained that I was being sarcastic, and he responded in a professorial tone that this was not the case, as sarcastic people change their affect to indicate sarcasm. "Meta-sarcasm" was apparently not a sufficient response on my part. 
  When I excitedly brought up him becoming my partner for the Astronomy Science Olympiad event, he thought for a moment and replied equivocally (and very quietly) that, "we shall see."
  I personally find him very compelling when he deigns to speak, and he does not seem to find social interaction unpleasant, he just lacks the apparent desire to ever really *begin* a conversation.
  ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    First, figure out whether they're actually introverted.

    When I say "I'm introverted" I mean that I've got a little "social energy" meter, which gets drained whenever I talk to people. This meter is not very big, so I don't tend to enjoy random conversations with strangers, because they drain an important resource I might need for other things, like talking to a friend. After social interactions, I need some time to be by myself in order to let that meter charge back up. I'm happiest having two to four close friends that I see once or twice a week, because close friends take less social energy and I don't really need that many of them (or that much of them) to meet my small social needs. (My understanding of extroverts is that they're the opposite, where they have an empty "social interaction" meter that they regularly need to fill, and they get distressed when they don't have enough social interaction, a feeling that I get only rarely.)

    There are two related concepts:

    * Some people don't have friends, or have trouble making friends. This *is* the case for a lot of introverts, because a lot of introverts don't pick up the skills and habits needed to make friends, but not everyone who doesn't have any friends is an introvert. I've met clear extroverts with no friends, people who talk a lot at work or in class in order to get their required dose of social interaction in, and then go home to no friends, or maybe a house full of children and a romantic partner (and introverts tend not to like extroverts like this). So if you see someone who's alone or doesn't speak much, it might be that they're an extrovert in disguise.
    * Some people don't have social skills. Being awkward is a typical introvert trait, because having less social interactions means that we don't tend to develop social skills, especially those which involve being socially proactive (like starting conversations with strangers, flirting, or making introductions). But just because someone sucks at social skills doesn't mean that they're introverted; maybe they just never learned, because social skills are typically one of those things that aren't properly taught. (I have, again, met extroverts who were socially inept. Learn to read a room, Brenda!)

    (I suspect that your particular introvert is an introvert with poor social skills in addition to introversion.)

    So once you have found an *actual* introvert, the first thing you need to be aware of is that a lot of introverts won't want to be your friend. Personally, I've found that with a once-weekly D&D group and an extroverted wife, I only need about one social interaction thing on top of that a week, which I almost invariably get. If someone tried to get me to sign up for something or to be friends, I would internally grimace and then try to be polite about not doing that.

    If an introvert *does* want to be your friend, then you will probably have to be the one who makes the first move, and the second move, and most of the moves after that. Introverts will often get accused of making the other party "do all the work", which can be true, but usually because there's unequal needs in the relationship. (Me not wanting to see a friend more than once a week when he wants to see me three times a week has been the cause of a few friendships ending. They interpret that as me not liking them, or not putting in effort, rather than me just getting socially drained too quickly with no time to recover. For me, seeing them *is* the work, and I might enjoy our time, but it's still a draining effort on my part.)

    If you want casual conversation with an introvert, I personally think it's best to be as gentle and non-committal as possible, so they can choose their own level of engagement. "Tell me about X" obligates the introvert to talk about X, while saying something that allows them to relate their own story or thing *if they want to* will tend to work a lot better (and again, lack of social skills, which is somewhat common in introverts, complicates this, because the socially unskilled won't always pick up on an open-ended invitation to speak). Similarly, if you're in a group setting, asking the introvert to speak about something seems, to me, like not the right way to go; you want to give them openings, and offer them ways into the conversation, but not directly tax their social batteries. If you do try to make them talk about something, make sure that it's a topic they actually have something for, otherwise it's like trying to give a book report on a book they haven't read. (I've had extroverts try to include me in conversation like this, asking me "what was it like to grow up Mennonite" in a way that was clearly meant to be an olive branch but which I found really taxing.)

    Did he grow up in China? It's possible there's some cultural barriers at work here. Especially with stuff like social skills and sarcasm. I know Japanese people sometimes have difficulty 'getting' sarcasm, but I don't know about Chinese people.

  Parasyte Maxim - Anime Recommendation!

  So I know most anime aren't rational, and I'm not going to say that Parasyte has overarching rational themes (though it sort of does) but I think anime lovers that enjoy the content of this sub would find Parasyte a good watch (though it's quite gory, so it won't fit everyone's appeal)

  To put it simply and with only slight spoilers for episode 1: Our protagonist wakes up one day with a titular "Parasite" where his right hand and forearm used to be. The parasite is cold, logical, curious, intelligent and most importantly selfish. He prioritizes his own life above all else and (as his life is tied to the protagonist's) prioritizes the protagonist's life as well. We quickly learn that the parasite is not alone and others of his kind start cropping up and causing trouble. 

  The parasite and our protagonist often have arguments about topic such as the sanctity of human life vs all life and altruism vs selfishness. Our protagonist is your fairly standard human anime lead, though I will say he's notably more realistic and level headed. While he's still sometimes prone to charging in blindly for emotional reasons, those moments aren't nearly as frequent as they are with other leads.

  We also get to see the parasite (both the lead's and the others of his kind) evolve as organisms and characters as the series progresses and time passes. As parasites all have identical beginnings, you would think that they would be stock, cookie cutter characters of each other. And they both are and aren't. It's done in a fairly impressive way that feels somewhat realistic. 

  People die, a lot. And plot armor isn't really a thing for anyone, even the most important characters.

  Overall, it's a very good watch. And a fairly short one, as it's only 24 ~22 minute episodes. And the themes it tackles (such as nature vs nurture, is *life* intrinsically valuable) are very much up the r/rational alley in my opinion. I think it's worth a watch :)

    I liked parasyte. It was kinda miraculous it even got an adaptation since its an old manga. But seeing it revitalised in a modern setting was awesome. I was just slightly feeling blueballed that it was so short and havent discussed the subjects fully.

    In terms of anime oh boy oh boy today there was ton of annoucments like Index 3rd season and SAO 3rd season + offspin of season 2...

    i kinda like index even tho it has plenty of flaws i really like the characters, character designs and worldbuilding while SAO....oh man......
    ```

    - u/Kishoto:
      ```
      I really enjoyed SAO as well. It's one of my favorite animes and though, like most, I feel the Aincrad arc was the best by far, I'm still invested enough in the characters and the story to be interested in future seasons.
      ```

      - u/IgonnaBe3:
        ```
        ughhh i didnt mean the "oh man" in a good way....but you do you. I found SAO really BS in terms of narrative, BS power of jesus-kun and BS deus ex machina and also the VR didnt make a lot of sense also the implications and themes of VR wasnt explored + we got cockblocked on the 70th floor and also ...yeah i am one of the haters of SAO. Personally i think SAO started or atleast popularized the whole VR and isekai wave of Harem LNs(even tho it technically isnt a harem but come on the club of girls the MC has around him even tho he is OTP with asuna is ridiciolous)

        edit. ALso i will probably enjoy all the yt content that will be made from the next season of SAO shitting on it or something. It will be glorious.
        ```

        - u/Kishoto:
          ```
          Haha, that's funny.

          SAO is definitely not rational and I can see why a ton of people don't like it. It definitely jumped through more than enough hoops to deserve a few cliche trope labels. But I think I like it because it delivers on a fantasy that's fairly stereotypical but still satisfying: The bad ass nerd who's good at video games gets to be actually badass and land the girl. Unlike in a lot of other animes, Kirito and Asuna's relationship is established in the middle of it, as opposed to in the end like most other series. 

          I understand that's just my personal bias though and don't ever try to defend SAO as gamebreaking or deep or any of that stuff. It's just fun. And cool. And kinda sappy. 

          Also I completely agree that the harem-ish thing is completely unnecessary. 100 percent.

  SlateStarCodex has been talking a lot about Predictive Processing lately (the idea that you brain mostly runs a hierarchy of modules, where each modules receives predictions/guesses/orders from above, data from below, and tries to 'connect' the two with Bayesian-like computations).

  Does anyone know if there is a plausible framework / theory out there that uses PP to explain and predict Ego Depletion?

  My personal gut feeling is that the two are probably strongly connected (assuming they're both real). I'm guessing that whatever mechanisms we use to take non-obvious decisions is heavily dependent on the Top-Down part of PP, and Ego Depletion happens either when some sort of limited resource powering Top-Down PP runs out, or when the Top-Down part of our brains "overheat".

  Obviously, I don't have a strong background in neurology, and I have no idea if what I said even made sense. Has research been done in that direction before?

  I'm in the middle of exploring my tastes in music, in a project that I'll eventually describe in full here for the benefit of the two or maybe even three people whose idea of "exploring the world of music" involves a spreadsheet and charts. 

  Right now, I'm interested in song/album/band recommendations for any of the following: 

  * Art rock
  * Baroque pop
  * Blues rock
  * Comedy songs
  * Electronic rock
  * Folk pop
  * Garage rock
  * Glam rock
  * Pop rock
  * Trip Hop

  I've mostly been going by Top 10 lists and such that I've found online, but I've found that the process is more enjoyable (and a tiny bit more successful too) when I'm going off of personal recommendations.

      Yes, absolutely. If I were sent to a desert island and could pick only one artist's collection to take with me, I'd pick Weird Al, hands down. 

      > If there's specific genres within that list that you'd like, I could try to make recommendations

      Most of the list above is comprised of subgenres of rock music, so I suppose that anything beneath the umbrella of rock music has a decent chance of working out. 

      Or did you mean "specific artists" rather than "specific genres"?

  I assembled a new computer recently! Well, two, actually, to help me with some projects I've currently in the works. Took a few hours and still have a few things left to do, but they seem to work well enough (been running @ 100% load for a week+ now with no issues). Some [pictures](https://imgur.com/a/dfqvr) and an [animation](https://gfycat.com/pitifulthoroughgalah) to look on, and a more [detailed thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/72e8p5/build_complete_ryzen_1700_work_builds/)* regarding the builds.

  I also wrote [another poem](https://nikvetr.wordpress.com/2017/09/26/wrinkled-lips-and-cold-sneers/) this week. My level of travel pretentiousness is the maximum allowable level of travel pretentiousness!

  *(incidentally, I seem to be having trouble on this account -- and also my previous one -- to get people to engage with OC.

It might be that reddit's overall quality has gone up, leaving me in the dust, or my postings have gotten worse, but it doesn't feel like it. I feel kinda silly and whiny for griping about this, but, like, I want attention! Maybe just a bit. Especially when I put time into something.  Anyone else experienced similar?)

    Timing is super important with Reddit posts. Post at a time when few people are voting and you get shafted by the post that's put up later but during peak hours, as Reddit weights the votes made in the first hour more heavily than those of the next several.
    ```

    - u/alexanderwales:
      ```
      The hot ranking is:

          Log(abs(Upvotes-Downvotes)) + (age/45000)

      In other words, there's a decreasing impact from each additional upvote, and then "hotness" is also decreasing over time. A new post will beat an old post, all else being equal, but a sufficiently upvoted post can stay ahead of newer posts for quite a while.

      Timing is important partly because the "age" factor is one that you can never beat, only stay ahead of for a bit. I think the general rule is that you should actually post *ahead* of peak hours by a certain margin depending on subreddit, in order to be one of the things that's on the top when peak hours roll around, which will likely get you the additional votes to stay ahead of age. (Same logic for website design and picking what to put "above the fold", because a lot of people will just stop by to look at that and nothing else.)

      From recollection, the timing differs somewhat for text and image posts, but 8am or 9am Central (UTC -6) is a good starting place. This is why all the threads on /r/rational are set up to automatically post around that time; it maximizes how long the posts will stay on top. (Of course, once everyone knows this, then the ideal strategy changes in order to avoid competition.)

      Edit: You can see all the python code [here](https://github.com/reddit/reddit/blob/master/r2/r2/lib/db/_sorts.pyx), though reddit code is no longer maintained open source, and the actual code they use might have diverged (though I doubt it). Also, shout out to /r/TheoryOfReddit.
