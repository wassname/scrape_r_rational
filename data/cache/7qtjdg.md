## I made a Matrix channel for /r/rational

### Post:

I don't want to split the community, so feel free to bridge my chatroom to Discord. This looks like a good program for bridging: https://github.com/42wim/matterbridge

I've messaged the admins about this, I hope they respond soon.

  why?

    because I like matrix, and I don't like Discord. I like open source software because for the purposes of rationality it makes it easier for me (and others) to map and modify what I observe, in terms of software.

        Thanks!

        However, I think at some point I ought to test my beliefs about free software. For example, I believe that proprietary software is often malware. I think I could test that by taking samples of popular software that is commercial, freeware, open source but nonfree, and free, and figuring out how many from each category contain features/antifeatures that I wouldn't like.

          I don't think "malware" maps to "features that I don't like". Personally, I like Discord. Ideally, every program would be open source, but I feel like decentralized communities are bound to be smaller, and Matrix doesn't seem to have all of Discord's ease of use features (let alone video chat), so it's not a real competitor.

          i bet if you wrote it up or made the project open source people would be into that
          ```
