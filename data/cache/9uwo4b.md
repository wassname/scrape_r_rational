  Thus Cat invented Sim-Earth, though forever after her people wondered wtf "Earth" means.

  Seriously, this means she can reshape massive amounts of terrain very quickly. Valleys, mountains, creating or filling in mountain passes.  She is become the changer of worlds.  

  In the real world geography controls far more than people realize. Cat doesnt need an army any longer to destroy empires.  She can fill in harbors to uselessness. Reroute rivers important to trade. Bury or steal forests. 

  I am in awe of the possibilities...and amused at the idea of calernian farmers trying to irrigate with a river filled with underdark leviathans.

    Well, she's going to have a pile of hideously empowered drow that she, a demigod, can't really touch. Just apply those to the problem and let it the fun begin.

  > Great Strycht had proved as much of a wonder as Great Lotow, in its own way.

  Have we just skipped over what happened in Lotow then? Because things were not settled there, and the exact way things shook out seems important to know. If Cat's going the classic evil route of kidnapping people and forcing them into her magically bound army, then the details are quite important. Especially if it's literally the first time she's doing it. Outside the serial it lets us know what to expect with this strategy when she does it off screen later on, and inside the universe of the Guide it determines how she's able to move onward to Strycht and the inner cities and is a fairly important turning point within her own narrative.


  Like, are the sigil holders still in Winter? Did they all humbly agree to sign up? Did some of them wander off in search of a way out? Did they try and fight Cat? What's the deal with the seven demigods who were individually a threat to Cat and had a great reason to band together?

  This chapter has no information, except that Cat's gone to Strycht, and a passing comment that Soln is now with Cat.


  >“Yes, Indrani wants me to start dropping mountains,” I sighed. “I’m well aware.”

  >“There are also volcanoes in what was once Summer,” the shade reminded me. “Actually triggering an eruption when we need it would be significantly more difficult, but not outright impossible.”

  >“There’s basically everything in Arcadia, if you look long enough,

  What? When did this become an option? First she's apparently secretly had the ability to use her portals to cut through things the whole time, and now she can drop mountains on people and steal cities? This is a crazy amount of power escalation coming out of almost nowhere.

  Not too mention that she's apparently now capable of using Absolute Positioning, which was set up as an incredibly difficult, dangerous task, without Masego. She's not even done any practice or training that we've seen.

  I mean, Cat's gotten a lot of power ups over the series (an awful, *awful*, lot) but this is one of the biggest so far and has also happened without any commentary or explanation?

  >this is basically Dread Empress Sinistra’s plan only with riches instead of hero-delivered death at the end.”

  What have we learnt about raising death flags Cat?

  >Night could be taken without killing

  Did we know this? It feels like the kind of thing that could have consequences for Drow society.

  >“I should have killed her myself, mother to daughter.”

  God damn Akua. I occasionally find myself liking you, but then you keep dropping things like this. Fantastic character though.

    >the exact way things shook out seems important to know.

    I couldn’t disagree more. Cat having a dramatic showdown with the 7 leaders would be important if it were the climax of the arc. But the 7 were explicitly said to be small fish in a bigger pond. Cat found a winning move without drawing her sword, and the implications of her choice are shown in this chapter. We don’t need stilted dialogue where the antagonistic characters assert that they have no choice but to comply, followed by more stilted dialogue where Cat agrees.

    Imagine that we got the update that you’re asking for, where Cat pops in to Arcadia to check on her prisoners. Maybe it takes a few tries. Eventually they submit. This might be an engaging sequence of dialogue or torture porn but is there any plot-relevant information that we wouldn’t otherwise discover?
    ```

    - u/hailcapital:
      ```
      I strongly agree with this. What we're getting right now is mostly character work between Cat and Archer and Cat and Akua, as well as world-building, so it hasn't been too bad, but ultimately there's a ceiling for how much interest you can have in "Cat takes on some Strong Mighty who we've never seen before and she has no real reason to care about."
      ```

    - u/sparr:
      ```
      > but is there any plot-relevant information that we wouldn’t otherwise discover?

      I want to know whether or not any of the drow survived and remained in Arcadia to become antagonists later, rather than being surprised by it later. Also if they had any notable interaction with fae while there that Cat knows about now.
      ```

    - u/Agnoman:
      ```
      >at having a dramatic showdown with the 7 leaders would be important if it were the climax of the arc. But the 7 were explicitly said to be small fish in a bigger pond

      We spent a couple of chapters building up just how strong the weakest sigil-holder in Lotow was, and how the 7 leaders were individually a threat to Cat even before they had a great reason to band together. Then they were put in Arcadia, where they had a whole host of options for getting out, and probably weren't in an incredible amount of danger themselves.

      But leave aside the more logistical concerns and look at the narrative: Cat is abducting people, forcing them into magical service, and I'm pretty sure we've had chapter quotes about this exact situation. She was also monologuing about her inevitable win before locking them in an "inescapable" trap and walking away. Knowing how this played out is important if this is going to be standard operating procedure for her, exactly so it can be glossed over in the future.

        They had a great reason to band together against the Dwarves too.  They're culturally incapable to working together because of the Night.

        > whole host of options for getting out

        Like how?  If it is not in the Night then it's not known to them.

        > probably weren't in an incredible amount of danger themselves

        Did you forget that Cat and company can travel though Arcadia safely only because of her deal with the Fae Queen?

          I think you might have missed the part about cabals.

          >Like how? If it is not in the Night then it's not known to them.

          I listed a few [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/9uwo4b/rthf_a_practical_guide_to_evil_book_4_chapter_68/e99qrsx/).

          >Did you forget that Cat and company can travel though Arcadia safely only because of her deal with the Fae Queen?

          Cat, hakram and Apprentice were walking through Arcadia back before they had a deal and *while activley at war with the fae* just fine, and this was when Cat was the squire and far weaker she or the Drow are now.

          Will survived wandering around for six months on his own, back when he was roughly equal to cat circa book one.

          Black, notable in part for his relative weakness, used it for fast travel.

          And Juniper/Cat's only concern about sending scouts into Arcadia back at the start of book 3 was time dilation, and they talked about how they'd send an army of normal soldiers in if they knew it wouldn't escalate the situation.

          And Arcadia itself is so vulnerable to stories that Cat literally just had to say, in a hesitant voice, "you'll never get away with this" to utterly upend a fight with a powerful Fae who was easily destroying her. What do you think happens if one of the Drow, after being monolouged too and locked in what's meant to be an inescapable death trap, say "I will escape and have my revenge"? Because personally I think things might start looking like the Count of Monte Christo.

          That's fair. A few of the top of my head:

          * Will went into and out of Arcadia through a set of permanent gates that exist

          * Black and Warlock used Arcadia for fast travel. We don't have the full details on this, but to my best knowledge it involved Black summoning a fae to creation to open a gate into Arcadia, and then Black later finding one and coercing it to open a gate back out of Arcadia

          * We've seen magical rituals involved in moving things from creation towards Arcadia

          * Book three we find that any high-ranking fae can open a gate out of Arcadia. Which brings us to two sub options: 1) Eat the faerie and take it's knowledge and the Secret of Gate-Making. 2) force it to open a portal with their faerie-queen crushing strength 

          And what are the chances of any of these things happening, you might ask? It's Arcadia - chance doesn't mean anything.

            Yes but how would the Mighties know any of these methods?  Considering how poor Ivah's knowledge of the humans are, I think they're pretty ignorant of anything outside of Everdark
            ```

            - u/Agnoman:
              ```
              Ivan's knowledge of humans is poor because the Drow have been isolated from outside civilizations for millenia. But Arcadia has existed since literally before Creation, and so that knowledge isn't going to go out of date.

              Add onto that that there's a significant risk factor just from escape methods *existing* - the way Arcadia has been explained is that it's going to drop things into you if they're story relevant. Like, say, a way out of the death trap a villain just you in after proclaiming the imminentcy of their inevitable vixtory.

        Regarding her narrative, I believe she even said that this being an Evil vs Evil aligned conflict, she can employ the most effective means necessairy to reach her goal without Above getting involved.

        As long as the plan looks solid from the outside everything should go according to it since there's no story shenanigans going on.

        - u/Agnoman:

  - u/BaggyOz:
    ```
    IIRC Akua can help with absolute positioning but I don't think stealing the lake requires absolute positioning. Cat had to open a portal at a specific location in Arcadia during the battle of the camps. She doesn't need to open a portal in a specific place in Arcadia to drain the giant lake.
    ```

    - u/Agnoman:
      ```
      >She doesn't need to open a portal in a specific place in Arcadia to drain the giant lake.

      She does if she wants to be able to keep the lake in a usable form. Or if she wants to drop a mountain on her enemies like she apparently can now.

      >IIRC Akua can help with absolute positioning 

      Where was this mentioned? Because I can't recall that coming up anywhere. Plus they needed the Observatory, which itself was a huge investment of resources.
      ```

      - u/BaggyOz:
        ```
        Perhaps I should have been clearer, she doesn't  need to be able to open a portal at a specific place such as a particular lake like before, due to the volume of water she just needs to be able to open a portal with an accuracy smaller than a province.

        I believe that it was never stated absolute positioning required anything specific to Hierophant, he merely guided Cat and provided the bowl of water. There's nothing to suggest that he couldn't be replaced by a mage of similar knowledge such as Akua. Plus for all we know Masego left the bowl with Cat.

        Youve also got to consider that Cat is much more in tune with her mantle now and can shove the side effects in to hindred or thousands of Drow.
        ```

          Yes. On creation side. On Arcadia side she's got to put it somewhere it can remain as a lake if she wants to pull it back out again. Or, if she wants to drop a mountain on her enemies, she's got to open a portal to a specific mountain, and then above her enemies.

          This is all approximately as complex as what she was doing in the Battle of the Camps, where she opened a portal to a specific lake and then roughly above the armies she wanted to destroy, and that instance was treated as a huge deal.

          >I believe that it was never stated absolute positioning required anything specific to Hierophant, he merely guided Cat 

          He also explicitly used magic to help the process along. And saying that Masego can easily be replaced is something of a leap when he's one of the most powerful mages around and he's doing one of the larger rituals we've seen in the series, with Cat temporarily embracing the perspective of a god

          I'll agree that if anyone could replace him here, then it'd be Akua (even without a proper name of her own)... but there's also no evidence that Akua is doing that? And if she was, then it'd be a fairly huge deal anyway, if for different reasons?

          >Plus for all we know Masego left the bowl with Cat.

          As a reminder, that "bowl of water" was a link to the observatory, which was a huge investment of time and resources and is presumably less accessible from the Everdark. If Cat even has the bowl, which has never been stated. And where would she carry a bowl for months on end anyway? Do you think she took it to the Dead King?

          >Youve also got to consider that Cat is much more in tune with her mantle now and can shove the side effects in to hindred or thousands of Drow.

          And if this is something that lets her make super powered portals, it'd be nice to have some reference to that in the text, rather than glossing over what's arguably the biggest power boost Cat has gotten thus far.
          ```

          - u/Ka_min_sod:
            ```
            From what I understand The absolute positioning was a big deal to do because of the size of the gate. It was so large that is created a swamp after a few seconds, 5 iirc. They did this not by creating a traditional gate but overlaying the fae over creation, which I guess is an entirely different thing than gating. 


            Draining the drow lake isn’t as difficult, just put one portal in a really deep spot and the other end over a natural basin in winter. 

            So I guess what I’m saying is that Cat can do the same thing by herself with her new control and grasp of her powers, but at a different rate than absolute positioning. The math and time required to drain a province sized lake over several days is a question of fluid dynamics that I can’t answer, but in a word, absolute positioning just makes it happen near instantly by comparison.
            ```

            - u/vimefer:
              ```
              Cat, Larat and now Akua all can create gates to and from Arcadia, with some degree of "aiming" to the other side and precise control of where the gate appears on whichever side they are currently sitting on, this we already know and was established. Larat can make the largest gates, with Akua second and Cat trailing behind, IIRC.
              ```

            - u/Agnoman:
              ```
              >was a big deal to do because of the size of the gate.

              Not quite. Cat and Masego, even working together, required the Observatory to pull it off.  The observatory which is an incredible tool for scrying, and was an incredible sink of resources to build.

              The fact that they needed an expensive scyring tool points towards this being something of a precision act.

              >They did this not by creating a traditional gate but overlaying the fae over creation, which I guess is an entirely different thing than gating

              The event was still described as a gate opening up over the armies, several times. The fact that Cat called out the process as somewhat distinct from gating just reinforces how difficult a task it's meant to be.

              > Cat can do the same thing by herself with her new control and grasp of her powers

              I'd buy this more if cat had made a comment literally anywhere about how her capability with gates has expanded, instead of her just receiving one of her biggest power ups seemingly in the background.

          ?

          Because for a start that math wasn't about the act of gate keeping, and beyond that Masego was doing a lot more than crunching numbers back when we saw the first lake drop.

    The sigil-holders apparently took the oaths and may have been granted fae titles; as Akua now calls them the Peerage. Though I do agree that forcing Mighty into service like that seems worryingly villainous. 

    Absolute positioning involved aligning specific places in Creation and Arcadia and opening a portal between them. That wasn't what she did when she stranded the Mighty or drained the lake here, she just opened a single portal to whatever part of Arcadia corresponds to this area and then closed it again.
    ```

    - u/Agnoman:
      ```
      >as Akua now calls them the Peerage

      This actually isn't stated. Akua calls the titled Drow the Peerage, but all we know of who those Drow are is that it includes "Soln and its fellows". How many of its fellows? Your guess is as good as mine. How did Soln end up oathed and titled? Your guess is as good as mine. Was there any change in protocols with the Drow who didn't originally sign up by choice? You get the idea.

      >Though I do agree that forcing Mighty into service like that seems worryingly villainous.

      Add onto this that there's a single obvious failure point for the Drow - the oaths - and it gets even more worrying. We've been told how obvious failure points tend to fail at just the wrong moment, even if we haven't really seen it happen.


      >she just opened a single portal to whatever part of Arcadia corresponds to this area and then closed it again.

      This potentially makes it difficult/impossible to get the lake back *out* of Arcadia like she thinks she can (if the other side is, say, a hill/incline or even just flat land)

      But throwing mountains and volcanoes on her enemies is definitely the sort of thing that absolute positioning would be used for. Hell, she threw a *lake* onto her enemies just a few chapters ago, the exact act that was shown to require absolute positioning.

        Yes? I'm not sure what your point is here. You’re right, we know very little of what happened with the sigil-holders. All I was saying was that at least some of them appear to have been given Winter titles. 

        >Add onto this that there's a single obvious failure point for the Drow - the oaths - and it gets even more worrying. We've been told how obvious failure points tend to fail at just the wrong moment, even if we haven't really seen it happen

        In fairness the reason we haven't seen it happen much is because Black taught her to avoid single points of failure from day one. Although there are two examples I can think of-Cat's plan in the war games back in Book One and the lake-dropping at the start of this book.

        >This potentially makes it difficult/impossible to get the lake back out of Arcadia like she thinks she can (if the other side is, say, a hill/incline or even just flat land)

        The lake is described as being half the size of Daoine. It's not going to drain away any time soon

        >But throwing mountains and volcanoes on her enemies is definitely the sort of thing that absolute positioning would be used for. Hell, she threw a lake onto her enemies just a few chapters ago, the exact act that was shown to require absolute positioning.

        True. Hopefully we'll get an explanation in the next few chapters.

          Right, I think we're on the same page here as my point is exactly that - we know very little of what happened with the sigil-holders, which is an important thing for us to know about for the reasons I mentioned.

          >The lake is described as being half the size of Daoine. It's not going to drain away any time soon

          But put it out on flat land and it's not going to form a lake, so much as spread out into a very thin marshland-looking thing - and that's not exactly conducive to getting the water *out* with portals, because it wouldn't drain neatly. She just talked about the difficulty of pulling all the water out of the lake due to irregularities in the topography, and that's happening in what was already the basin of a lake.

          I mean it could work, I guess, as there are a lot of unknowns in play here. But it doesn't really matter either way? My point is that Cat can 
          can apparently do absolute positioning on her own now, and what happens with the lake here doesn't really change that either way when she's talking about dropping lakes/mountains/volcanoes from Arcadia onto her enemies.

          >In fairness the reason we haven't seen it happen much is because Black taught her to avoid single points of failure from day one. Although there are two examples I can think of-Cat's plan in the war games back in Book One and the lake-dropping at the start of this book.

          I think a big part of the reason is that Cat tends to avoid *plans* full stop and go for a more improvisational approach to problem solving. 

          Although the specific ones I was thinking of were the more recent plans from Juniper and Black against the Crusades, which had big obvious failure points that triggered nothing (even though there was explicit discussion of the need to avoid such plans right beforehand). But that's straying from the point here.

          >True. Hopefully we'll get an explanation in the next few chapters.

          Fingers crossed. Personally my preferences run more towards getting foreshadowing and setup happening *before* important things occur, but I'm certainly not going to say no to an explanation.

              "Trifle" in that individual members of the group were actual threats to Cat, and who are a vital first step along that more dangerous path. Plus there's the whole narrative importance of Cat kidnapping people and forcing them into her magically-bound army.

      Not really?

      We've never heard of Cat's gates being able to cut things until a few chapters ago, despite her having them for over a book now. And the last time  she was doing precision work like this required Masego, the Observatory, and a whole lot of set up.

  Sort of a rush-job chapter to get us back up to speed after a month skip.

  Akua's separation of personality might be the means of betrayal, though. Cat's questions might be being asked to one and not the other. I doubt Diabolist would tip her hand so early, but maybe Akua would.

  It's generally agreed on this subreddit that Akua will take the Mantle of Winter and we'll get Cat with a Name again, while I tend to agree, Cat is still clenching her teeth about Liesse. How does the Queen of Winter make up for past sins? Nothing about Akua, Diabolist or Winter suggest to me that it'll be a peaceful abdication.

    Really? Why do people think akua will get the winter mantle, it seems like a hilariously bad idea to me
    ```

    - u/signspace13:
      ```
      Yeah, I'm not to into that idea either, I haven't been keeping up too much lately (mostly because I'm waiting for some chapters to build up, I check these comments cause I enjoy spoilers) but I'm not a fan of Cat losing a power that she rightfully earned, I like the idea of her harnessing the power to her will more, changing it in such a way that it conforms to her desires, which has always been Cat's brand of evil.

      My pet theory on how her plot with Akua is that at some point their will be a merger, similar to what happened with the mantle, she will somehow merge with Akua and gain all her memories, which would make her better at magic and politics, both of which she dearly needs, but not change too fundamentally as a result. 

      I have had this theory ever since Akua managed to weave herself into the mantle, it might however happen in such a way that conforms to the above suggestion, Akua makes off with the mantle and to get it back Cat has to take her in with it, this could result in a name, something defined by the act of bending the power of a god to your will, rather than just having it.
      ```

      - u/vimefer:
        ```
        I hope Akua ends up dissolving into Cat's persona rather than a melding, if you're right. And I hope that the process is properly mind-chillingly horrific for her to undergo while conscious and able to understand what is happening to her.

        That sounds awfully like Hierophant's area of expertise, although he is focused on actions performed by the power of gods (miracles) he isn't shy of binding, brainwashing and generally fucking over gods
        ```

        - u/signspace13:
          ```
          That is a bit of an overlap, my assumption of Heirophant, and most other mage named, is that he is doing it with magic, not name magic, but actual sorcery as it is defined in the world. I believe this because if it isn't true than mage names are complete bullshit. 

          Heirophant can use the magic to imitate a god's (lower case intentional) action so long as he has *witnessed*, my idea for cat is more domineering than that, she would be an actual threat to all Gods, including above and bellow, and I say this because the story has to have an end, and the most conclusive end I can think of is if Cat manages to tell the Gods to go fuck themselves and leave her continent alone, a conclusion in which she would need the ability to kill and utilise the power of gods for, because the best reason I can think of for them to leave her and her stuff be is if they are *terrified* of her.

            So you are talking about a return to Take/Break/Fall Cat or some version of it?

            I can see that happening if Cat loses the Winter mantle, gets a dope new name and somehow breaks Creation in the process.
            ```

      Yes, and Akua is famous for those.  So she’ll steal the winter mantle and horrible things will happen

    - u/leakycauldron:
      ```
      Catherine hasn't been doing a great job of using winter power. The guess is that Akua will be her treacherous lieutenant and usurp the moment winter is cut from her by Saint of Swords again
      ```

    - u/leakycauldron:
      ```
      After all, she Named the Lords, has been the shunting spot for Catherine's power and has been getting in close with cat's Fae faction since they left for Arcadia. Diabolist is more than prepared to usurp extraworldy powers.
      ```

      - u/tavitavarus:
        ```
        Yeah but Diabolist herself admitted she has no hope of taking the mantle by force as in Kaleidoscope part 6

        'In her current state, it would be impossible for her to claim this body if Catherine disallowed it. The discrepancy in will and power was overwhelming.'

        And any more complicated plot will be discovered by Cat during their regular chats.

    No, there is no such consensus, and I wish people would stop treating Cat like an idiot.

      Wouldn't you agree that she's going to try to usurp Winter, though? She's got 'Traitorous Lieutenant' carved into her soul.
      ```

      - u/werafdsaew:
        ```
        No, she currently has no plan to usurp Winter, or else Cat would find out during one of her daily chats.  She certainly would try if she thought she would succeeds, but she won't until she's certain.
        ```

          Akua the Diabolist definitely knows a thing or two about avoiding questions and subverting oaths

  - u/LordSwedish:
    ```
    I think Cat's words are on point here, the "veil" Praesi use to separate themselves from their titles is fragile. Catherine doesn't just ask Akua or Diabolist, she asks her soul..and by ask, I mean force.

      I've always suspected that Sinistra was one of the more intelligent villains.  She saw an overarching problem caused by geography and tried to solve it through her only lens.  The Gods probably leaned heavily on the scale to make it blow up.

        intelligence and classical villainy aren't necessarily in opposition- I think Kairos and Akua speak to that.
