  Too much smut for me.

  Decent amount of things-that-look-like-thinking, one possible example of actual thinking.

    +1. MC uses resources in fairly trivial ways, contrasted with everyone else being 'heroic'. And that's presented as some kind of tactical genius. (Wow, you're going to use *sleep* and *silence* together to ambush a camp! So creative!)

    Seconding this. Also, I'm not interested in seeing goblins rape somebody every chapter or two.

    I agree that the rapefest is utterly tasteless.

    However, I did quite enjoy the rest of the story. No, the protagonist is not HPMOR-style brilliant, but the story is still a decent deconstruction of all the usual fantasy stories. It is kind of nice to read a story for once where adventurers act more like a SWAT team and less like muscle brains. 

    I also liked the little details like the kid swinging his sword around too much so the others can't help him, and getting it stuck against the cave wall. That sort of thing makes the story feel much more realistic/rational.
