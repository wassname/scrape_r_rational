## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  So, I had this idea (actually I think it was /u/ccc_037 who had it, so credit where credit's due...) that vampires can become zombies in the right conditions. But after finding out more about brains it's probably not possible. I wonder if it can be rescued?

  My vampires are powered by the brain (mind) and heart (magic). They can regrow limbs and whatnot. All good. This is powered by the heart's magic.

  Then we realised that there's no reason why a whole head can't grow back if the heart is damaged. So, immediate thought: it's a "blank" brain and it has only the basic vampire instincts (avoid light, seek blood). Basically, a fast zombie! Cool, huh?

  Problem: Brains Don't Work That Way. The brain is made by having a lot of connections grow during infancy and then die until only "good" connections are left. 

  So you've got basically got two choices for the new brain:

  1. Copy of the vampire's original brain (say at the time of turning), which would naturally include memories and personalities - bad because then you have young memories with old bodies, and old vampire bodies are very powerful. Bad because death is not necessarily permanent. Bad because where does the brain get "backed up"? Good because you can play with "what is the self" type things. Good because it's interesting and different to stuff I've seen before. Good because the new vampire is still dangerous. Good because the new vampire is probably scared and alone in this new world and might be easily manipulated, which can make for a good story. Good because you can see powerful vampires beheading their subordinates to "reboot" them if they know too much or get too plucky.

  2. Infant brain, which cannot even control the muscles in the vampire's body. So you end up with a vampire who can't move, maybe some odd twitching, definitely can't talk. No threat to anyone. Brain can't grow as, while vampires can will their bodies to do things like heat up, grow hair, etc, if the brain doesn't work it can't will itself to grow. Good because it's kind of creepy and you can see a BBEG keeping a "zoo" of his enemies' infantile forms for intimidation (but BBEG can do the exact same thing by staking the vampires from #1). Bad because it's not dangerous at all. Good because the vampire personality is definitely dead.

  I really wish there's a way I can make a zombie-like vampire work (just any sort of bloodthirsty monster really). Anyone have any ideas?

  Originally I was leaning towards #2 but after writing out #1 it's probably a lot more interesting. I can also see a #1 who is staked for a few centuries slowly going insane from sensory deprivation and maybe acting like a zombie. At one point in the past, it was trendy for vampires to make "doubles" of themselves by cutting out pieces of their own hearts and letting them grow into full human size. So my main vampire has one of these things staked in a coffin in his giant storage room. But if they were #1 I think my main vampire would kill it upon realising it was him, but as he was before, because it would be horrifying to be faced by someone saying to you in the language you spoke as a child "did it work? Am I immortal?" and realising what you've done...

    Where does the structure and layout of cells in a dismembered arm get backed up?

    Here's an idea for vampiric regeneration which should work for allowing zombies.

    *  The vampiric regeneration works at different speeds depending on how damaged the vampire is. The more damaged the vampire the faster it works.

    *  The vampiric regeneration only works on one part of the body at a time.

    *  The vampiric regeneration automatically prioritizes where to apply regen on the body based on the type,severity and area of the injury. Brain damage has extremely low priority.

    The above means that you can easily have vampires with partially assembled brains walking around as zombies. They could heal eventually but it will take time, particularly if they keep getting minor injuries that stop their brain from healing.
    ```

    - u/MagicWeasel:
      ```
      > Where does the structure and layout of cells in a dismembered arm get backed up?

      I had that based on DNA. The question that naturally arises is that how does the heart know what DNA to use - after all, different cells in the body have different DNA, what if the heart's magic happens to lock onto a tumor cell, etc. 

      Way around that: turning someone into a vampire often fails, so the vampires who "rise" are the ones where the DNA "snapshot" was taken of a cell with appropriate DNA features.

      Using DNA as the explanation for regeneration does mean that #1 is harder to justify as saving the memories would require a snapshot of the actual physical brain structure at time of death rather than just DNA.

    > Problem: Brains Don't Work That Way. The brain is made by having a lot of connections grow during infancy and then die until only "good" connections are left. 

    Yet infant brains can and do show certain instinctive behaviours. Horses can stand up within an hour of birth, and gallop by the end of the first day. Human babies will [grab anything placed in their hand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmar_grasp_reflex) (and there are a number of other [primitive reflexes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_reflexes), many of which will also affect a new-born human infant as well).

    So, alright, #2 is never going to be able to make complicated plans, but I don't see why it can't display a few primitive instinctive behaviours. Not to the point of being able to sneak up on someone, perhaps, but certainly to the point of "if you put your arm in his hand he'll grab it and suck out the blood". (One of those could even be the instinctive reflex to will the brain to grow, I guess). Or do I just not know enough about how brains work? (That's quite possible, I'm not a biologist).
    ```

    - u/MagicWeasel:
      ```
      Yeah, but horses aren't humans. Horse brains are designed very carefully to allow them to gallop at hours old because otherwise they'd die. Human brains are designed to have protective parents. 

      Added to that, brain #2 is not really a proper infant brain, since I believe there are actual physical differences between adult and infant brains, and a vampire doesn't grow a baby arm when they regenerate their arms, so why would they grow a baby brain? So the brain itself wouldn't be an infant brain, it'd be an adult brain (i.e. pruned I guess?) but without having had careful connections made. 

      I think getting zombies to happen is going to take way too much handwaving. I think I'm beginning to make peace with #1, it's just as interesting but in a whole other way. But how the brain structure and thus memories are "snapshotted" is an issue, because DNA is easy for the vampire to have a record of, the brain structure not so much...

        > Yeah, but horses aren't humans.

        Neither are vampires. (Come to think of it, is there any reason - besides that the human vampires think it's squicky - why one can't have vampire horses?)

        --------------

        Here's another thought for the vampire brain structure (#3, perhaps) - it's the same for all vampires. If Tom the Vampire and James the Vampire both get their heads cut off, the regrown heads have different faces but share the exact same brain... which is already templated in the magic, and doesn't *need* to be snapshotted.

          > is there any reason - besides that the human vampires think it's squicky - why one can't have vampire horses?

          If I cling to DNA, perhaps it's a DNA thing: you'd need a vampire with horse DNA to seed it. Vampire transmission is what the previously human digestive tract is co-opted for: to make a new vampire, you vomit up Special Vampire Goo^TM into the new vampire's heart. That goo somehow is the seed material to create the new vampire. So you could say that that goo is for humans only, and you'd need to start a line of horse vampires with the appropriate magic skills to have something that makes sense. 

          >the regrown heads have different faces but share the exact same brain... which is already templated in the magic, and doesn't need to be snapshotted

          This was something else that came up - because vampires are 4D, perhaps the "vampire brain" is in the forth dimension and that has all the "RAWR KILL" stuff going on and ends up fully in control. The problem with THAT is that if you do that, it gets complicated because would cutting the human head off really work that way if they're 4D, you know? Like, 99.99% of the mass of that brain is in the 4th dimension, so losing the tiny slice on *this* dimension should be meaningless.

            Okay, so the victim needs to have what the spell classes as 'human DNA' to be turned into a vampire. This allows for some DNA strains to be completely immune, or to have other side-effects ('all descendants of that drooling idiot will be turned into especially stupid vampires!' kind of thing - petty familial grudges lost to the modern day).

            Then there's the question of what exactly is classed as 'human DNA'. Would *homo erectus* count, if you could find one? What about a chimpanzee? You could go with *modern* humans only, but there has to come a point where humans, through natural genetic change, become different enough to usee different DNA - beyond what the original spellcaster thought of as 'human'. Now, this is an *extremely* slow process... but it does become important.

            Because one possible definition of 'human' is 'sufficiently close to my current host's DNA'. This avoids the problem of humans slowly departing a narrow definition of 'human' to become something new, by allowing vampires to *follow* that evolutionary change.

            And that, if true, would allow a sufficiently dedicated vampire with some genetic cloning equipment and no moral or ethical qualms to create a series of bodies, working from more humanlike to more equine, change the first one, use it to change the next, and so on, and he can change his beloved steed into a vampire as well (this might be done to prevent having to keep buying and training new horses every few decades or so).

            Oooooh. It gets worse than that. Why would cutting through the vampire's neck remove his head in the first place? After all, 99% of the mass of the neck isn't reachable by your normal three-dimensional weapons. So if you, say, cut off a vampire's arm (or head) then, instead of falling to the ground, it should just stay there in mid-air and re-attach itself. (And then the vampire will be cross with you, not for cutting off his arm, but for ruining the sleeve of his exquisitely tailored suit).

            Now, if you have a four-dimensional sword - call it a 'magic sword' if you like - then you can go around cutting off vampire's heads, much to their shock and surprise. Or maybe if you take advantage of their weaknesses, by, say, arranging to shine sunlight on their heads. Or maybe the neck - and head - doesn't extend four-dimensionally and only the torso does (so you can cut off the head but not cut off, say, the kidney).

              DNA / vampire transmission would probably be in the "could I breed with this person" level of similarity required. So, ten million years from now a modern vampire probably couldn't turn the neo-humans into vampires, even if we assume they look pretty much the same.

              Vampire horse: I'd imagine each intermediate form would require an advanced enough brain to will the "transformation goo" to be made. I had in my head that it takes a few dozen/hundred years for a vampire to have enough transformation goo in the tank, or that the goo increases in potency over time, etc. And then the goo has to be deliberately vomited up. So it would have to be able to will the goo-vomiting (gross). 

              I want making a new vampire to be an "expensive" process in that it can't be continuously done to raise an army, "difficult" so you can't have your childe create a childe who creates a childe and thus have an army like that, and "risky" so you are not guaranteed to be successful. 

              But yes, if a vampire was willing to genetically engineer intelligent human-horse hybrids and continuously have them make slightly more horsey vampires, waiting the requisite time/taking the requisite risks of failure to produce them, you probably could. And then you'd have to keep a stable of horses for your vampire horse to feed from.


              -----

              >  It gets worse than that. Why would cutting through the vampire's neck remove his head in the first place? 

              Below is my earlier response to the same sort of question in this thread:

              That said, given vampires, werewolves aren't born in 4D, it's pretty easy to conceive that they have a very odd shape. Perhaps a tiny "spur" from their heart from which a whole second body comes, so they would perhaps flicker a tiny bit as they left their first body and their second (identical) body appeared, and then got smaller and turned into a bat. Could mean earth!body is vulnerable to beheading.

              Vampires can't control their transformation, just will it to start (since they're not 4D natives: werewolves don't even get to will it to start). So there's no chance of a vampire wearing "morph armour" by having their transformation stop at the full-size double body.

              >  Or maybe the neck - and head - doesn't extend four-dimensionally and only the torso does (so you can cut off the head but not cut off, say, the kidney).

              Yeah I think I'm going to say there's a ~1 atom thick spur coming out of the heart, which perhaps directly joins to the bat form, with no intermediate shapes visible to onlookers during transformation (except for perhaps "disappearing" altogether). With vampires not having control over the transformation process it's easy to conceive of it as "*poof* all of a sudden I'm a bat" and no need for more fine-grained control.

              My gargoyle does have fine grained control of his transformations though! Made me realise he'd have an interesting way to carry out one of his orders:

              > There was a knock at the door. Red grinned, placing the heavy book down to go answer it. William stood there, his clothing looking ever so slightly dishevelled; his shirt seemed to have hints of light grey powder on it, and his trousers were wrinkled. His tie was loose around his neck. A faint smell of smoke followed him inside. He did not smile; for the first time, Red thought he looked tired.

              > “Come in, please. Are you okay?” Red asked, concerned. William entered and began stripping as soon as Red closed the door behind him.

              > “I am fine.”

              > “Do you have… a bag?” Red murmured, not quite sure what William - who was now naked as the day he was born - was playing at.

              > “Why would I have a bag?” William asked, and then called out. “Julias!” 

              > “For the… thing you had to get for Elodia.” 

              > “Oh, that has already been delivered.” William said calmly. Julias appeared in the doorway, apparently unconcerned by his master’s state of undress.

              > “How may I be of assistance, your majesty?”

              > “Take this clothing and destroy it.” He handed Julias his clothes, scrunched into a small bundle.

              > “Of course, your majesty.” Julias replied, and his skin started rippling in that strange, hard to focus on way that it did whenever he transformed. The bundle of clothing disappeared instantly. Red squinted. He’d never seen Julias do that before. It seemed William hadn’t, either. He raised his eyebrows and gave a small, impressed smile, the same way he had when Red had found everything on that shopping list of his all those months ago.

              > “I take it that you have destroyed it as directed, rather than transporting it somewhere else?” William asked, apparently a bit uneasy.

              > “In a manner of speaking, your majesty.” Julias shrugged.  “My magic is complicated. Rest assured that no trace of it will be found, your majesty”

              > “Very well. You are excused.”

                That's reasonable. So, fair enough, a modern vampire couldn't turn neohumans, but his great-great-however-many-greats-grandchildren vampires will be neohumans and could thus turn neohumans.

                On vampire horses:

                > And then the goo has to be deliberately vomited up.

                Why can't the vampire cut his genetic chimera's stomach open and get at the goo that way? Sure, it'll take a while - especially if it's taking decades to get enough goo - so you'd have to have a pretty dedicated vampire to even try this...

                --------------

                > Yeah I think I'm going to say there's a ~1 atom thick spur coming out of the heart, which perhaps directly joins to the bat form, with no intermediate shapes visible to onlookers during transformation (except for perhaps "disappearing" altogether).

                This works out really well. And has consequences.

                - The humanoid form of the vampire is vulnerable to beheading - but the chiroptean form is not. You can cut off the vampire's bat head and he'll be no more than annoyed until it regrows.

                - Having said that, the bat-form may very well still be vulnerable to a stake through the heart - especially as the two forms are probably joined *at* the heart.

                - Whether in human or bat form, the human-form brain is doing the thinking.

                - The thin link between the two halves is vulnerable - to a 4D native. Breaking it doesn't kill the vampire (but probably hurts). If the bat-heart counts as part of the vampire-heart, then this might be a relatively neat way to grow a clone of the vampire - let it grow from the severed bat.

                - When the vampire turns into a bat, the bat always appears where the vampire's heart was (thus always in mid-air, hope you've got those wings out)

                - When the vampire turns back into a human, the heart always appears where the bat was. Thus, the bat has to be in mid-air before transforming.

                --------------

                (Destruction of clothes)

                Neat. Though, pedantically, another 4D native could still find traces of those clothes (unless perhaps Julius just shifted the clothes enough to toss them through the wall at the fireplace in the next room).

I think that doesn't have any odd consequences - though the 4D thing is so far in the background I don't know if it matters whether it's specific.

                  > another 4D native could still find traces of those clothes

                  True. I guess Julias is not concerned about this, or more likely the 4D world is inhospitable enough to normal matter that simply being in it would destroy the clothing (I'm imagining a 1 atom thick sheet of metal would be destroyed in a slight breeze). Not that the 4D world *has* a breeze...

                  Now i'm imagining the BBEG getting his own gargoyle detective on the case, and the gargoyle detective coming across the ruined remains of William's clothes. Then again - that'd make Julias not be very good at his job. 

                  I think I'm going to settle on the 4D world being inhospitable to non-4D objects as the easiest way to have the cool little detail and also have Julias be doing the right thing.

                    Well, he might not have had time since creating such DNA chimeras became possible to go through the whole centuries-long process.

                    > they'd be valuable gifts, I suppose???

                    Intriguingly, they'd be valuable - but quickly become *less* valuable if ever gifted. See, once you have *one* vampire horse, it's not hard to get twenty more - the difficulty lies in getting that one.

                    But oh, if you have the *only* one, then it is *extremely* valuable - because, short of getting one from you, anyone else can only have one with centuries of dedicated effort.

                    So it might be more valuable as something that he - casually - lets the other vampires know he *has* without ever letting anyone else get hold of one.

                    > RE: Consequences of heart-spur plan: Those are all excellent observations. Thanks for that! We'll say that the two hearts are joined, maybe that the heart is the only 4D object.

                    Sounds good (but see below).

                    The first trouble with this is that we've just established the vampires as being mostly 3D. There are a few other troubles as well - if Julius is wearing a 3D suit and is forced to change shape for a bit, his human form should still be wearing the suit on return; Julius can't store a few personal items just outside 3D space for security; but the idea that the vampire's human form starts degrading as soon as he is a bat is probably the biggest problem.

                    One could say that there are *specific* locations in 4D space that are dangerous to 3D objects, but that just means that there are places where, if William walks past, his bat-body suddenly dies.

                    An alternative option is that Julius is still holding the clothes (e.g. in his tail) outside of 3D space, and is intending to quietly toss them in the next fire or furnace he finds. Or maybe he intends to make a fire, outside 3D space, burn them there, and scatter the ashes. Or he deliberately *threw* the clothes down and 'out', such that they'll be pulled back by Earth's gravity but not otherwise interact with the 3D world until they're either deep in Earth's crust or possibly in the mantle (good luck finding it *there*).

                      Very true... hm. There's probably a vampire out there with the patience, though like you said, probably not with the technology to see it through yet.

                      > Julius can't store a few personal items just outside 3D space for security

                      That's something I don't want him doing, to be honest. The idea of Julias having his own hammerspace is pretty bad, though then again, if his masters don't know about it, it probably isn't going to come up. And if he's allowed to keep his clothes between transformations then he *has* hammerspace whether we like it or not. 

                      > Julius is still holding the clothes (e.g. in his tail) outside of 3D space, and is intending to quietly toss them in the next fire or furnace he finds. Or maybe he intends to make a fire, outside 3D space, burn them there, and scatter the ashes.

                      True. Julias definitely has a whole horrific "rest of the iceberg" type form underneath everything, since I've established that his humanoid form has blood but no bones, so the blood has to get made somewhere. He probably has a horrific flesh sac type thing further "above" his human form. And that could quite easily have all manner of limbs and organs that could be used to grab that bundle of clothes. Hell, maybe he'd *eat* them to destroy them.

                      > Or he deliberately threw the clothes down and 'out', such that they'll be pulled back by Earth's gravity but not otherwise interact with the 3D world until they're either deep in Earth's crust or possibly in the mantle (good luck finding it there).

                      Also a very good idea, though I'm not sure if putting them perpendicular to the mantle probably isn't conducive to "destroying" them. 

                      I think I like the idea of him grabbing them out of 3Dspace with his "tail", popping them into a 4D mouth of his, and then they're incorporated into his body.

                      Then again - canonically he can eat *rocks*, so why didn't he just eat the bundle of clothing? I suppose then he'd have to explain that he doesn't poop and William would not quite trust it, whereas if the bundle just seems to disappear it would make his master feel better about it whilst still being just as good.

                        How is it narratively different from him having a well-hidden safe in his room? He'd still have to be within reach of his "stash" to actually *use* it - it's not like he's going to be carrying it around everywhere with him. (He *could* carry a small bag with him everywhere he goes, but he can do that in 3D space as well - and what would he want to always have close, anyway? His teddybear?)

                        > maybe he'd *eat* them to destroy them.

                        ...this is a far better idea than any of the ones I came up with. Shift it, eat it, no more clothes, very impressed Master, no embarrassing questions about digestion.

                          Well, if we imagine him having at least one 4D arm that he can use to grab the clothing and eat it, he would be able to put all the items he wants to keep in hammerspace onto his 3D cross sections and so hold *quite a lot* of stuff. I mean, he'd have to concentrate to keep his fists closed or something, but he could even tie them to his arms if we say that any movement one of his forms makes is repeated on all of them. 

                          > no embarrassing questions about digestion.

                          That's where you're wrong! I can ask tons of embarrassing questions about gargoyle digestion. Because I seriously don't know whether he has an anus.

                          I mean, he's got a human-looking body, and all of his bodies can eat in that the mouth is attached to his 4D stomach. So he's got a functional mouth.

                          He has a son, so he can obviously make babies. So he's got some sort of penis in at least one of his forms (his son is with a siren, so, probably a human-compatible penis). He's canonically slept with men and women, so that's more evidence for a human compatible penis as well. 

                          So he can need a penis, that's fine, since who doesn't want to reproduce, or at least, do the things that are conducive to it. (I know, I know, our ace friends don't)

                          But he doesn't need an anus. All his waste just gets put into his hammerspace. So, does he have one? It would make his human form more convincing if he needs it to be, so maybe his human form has one - because why have a human form if it can't pass a strip search? Actually, now I think about it, if he's a two inch thick layer of flesh over a stone core, he wouldn't pass a modern "is this prisoner smuggling drugs up his butt" type test. So he probably also has a fake colon for some appropriate length so he'd be able to pass those things??? Or perhaps he has a fleshy tube joining his mouth and anus to keep appearances of having an esophagus and colon, though he'd look very weird with an endoscopy or colonoscopy and presumably the type of epithelium would change halfway through? (Probably at the nexus where food is transferred out of his 3D form and into his 4D form) 

                          But then, the fifteen foot tall stone gargoyle doesn't need to have an anus *at all*. So I suppose it doesn't? Or if we give him a tube, perhaps he does to maintain his topological shape? I'm going to need to ask my husband... 

                          Anyway.... this is why we try to ignore the embarrassing mechanical questions about anatomy and digestion. There's a lot of evidence around the place but it's all rather more information than I'd really care to know. And yet you start wondering about these things and you can't stop.

                            I was thinking he would use his tail for that, being the limb that doesn't have an analogue in his 3D body.

                            > Because I seriously don't know whether he has an anus.

                            Alright, there are three points to consider here.

                            First of all - his human form was clearly *deliberately* made to *look* human. Human shapes are complicated; but most of that complexity is in things like eyes, which need to be visible. Any craftsman capable of making a suitably accurate human eye isn't going to be tripped up over something as simple as a convincingly human rear end. So, on that basis alone, I'd say he has to be at least as human as [R. Daneel Olivaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._Daneel_Olivaw) - at a minimum, he has to be able to pass as a human when naked.

                            (But he might not be able to pass through a metal detector without setting it off, depending on exactly what sort of stone he's made of).

                            There's another question, though - where does what he eats go? Is he powering himself from the complete conversion of matter to energy (in which case he might well need only a small snack every century)?

                            And, related to that, what does he breathe out? (Humans tend to stick carbon onto the oxygen before we breathe it out, and that carbon comes - eventually - from the food we eat).

                            Once these three questions are sorted out, the remaining messy little details are easily resolved.

                              Regardless, he can use whichever limb it is to "hang" things in other parts of his 4D shape, allowing him to use hammerspace... Which is not necessarily a problem. I might have to ask on the upcoming munchkinry thread "how would you abuse hammerspace?" to see what I'm not thinking of.

                              >  What sort of stone he's made of

                              Sandstone, so he should be fine.

                              >  at least as human as R. Daneel Olivaw

                              Have not read much with him (though I have read *mirror image* a long time ago). I take it he'd have a realistic butt going on?

                              > where does what he eats go?

                              Just into 4D space. Like I said, the calculations were done previously and they indicated that 0.01% of his total mass is in any one of his cross-sections (or that his whole 4D body weighs more than the Earth). Either way, anything he eats just gets glommed into his 4D body: probably digested in some ineffable way, used for any raw material he might need for regeneration, etc. 

                              > And, related to that, what does he breathe out?

                              If he chooses to breathe, he's probably just breathing out the same air he breathed in. So a scientist would be able to tell something was odd about him by measuring his breath.

                              >  Is he powering himself from the complete conversion of matter to energy 

                              Nah, sunlight. He spends the daytime in a fully stone form that does some sort of advanced photosynthesis. Because it has to feed a gigantic 4D body, it has to be *very* advanced photosynthesis. He can forgo it for a few hours at a time, but only occasionally as he probably has very low power reserves. If he doesn't manage his energy very carefully he's probably going to die - like a hummingbird I suppose. 

                              > in which case he might well need only a small snack every century

                              He eats regularly, mostly for social reasons. His sense of taste is... different. (Aside: I'm actually doing an assignment on the determinants of food choice right now. Or rather, procrastinating.)

                                Hmmm. Here's a another thought - 4D backpack. Just holding things with his tail is going to get in the way when he needs to *use* his tail - a backpack will have more space and be easier to carry. (And the 3D cross-section of the straps will probably just look like a pair of fabric loops around his shoulders - he might be able to get away with calling it a fashion statement).

                                > Have not read much with him (though I have read mirror image a long time ago). I take it he'd have a realistic butt going on?

                                Oh, yeah. Olivaw was designed in order to be able to walk amid humans, observing them and gathering sociological data, without anyone being able to (immediately) tell they have a robot amongst them. This includes the ability to look convincingly human in a public shower or nudist colony. (Mind you, he doesn't excrete through it - if he eats anything, it goes into a bag in his chest - chewed but undigested - and he has to open his chest to empty the bag later).

                                Unlike Julius, Olivaw can't actually have children.

                                > Either way, anything he eats just gets glommed into his 4D body: probably digested in some ineffable way, used for any raw material he might need for regeneration, etc.

                                A reserve of raw material for regeneration makes a lot of sense. Then, no matter how old he gets, he's never going to completely fill up that reserve - even if he eats his way through a few entire planets over the centuries.

                                > If he chooses to breathe, he's probably just breathing out the same air he breathed in. So a scientist would be able to tell something was odd about him by measuring his breath.

                                  Yeah. I imagine the physics of the 4D shapes is loose enough that the extra mass isn't an issue (actually, he's probably got the lovecraftian equivalent of extremely long hair or fingernails in 4D space, since 4D objects are *so heavy*)

                                  This is probably true, and though I'd imagine given he lives a pretty safe life, over the centuries he's probably got such an unimaginable excess of matter that it would take one of those ["if he was reduced to an atom in size once an hour for ten thousand years, he'd use 1% of his mass"](https://what-if.xkcd.com/34/) type of koans. 

                                  Just going to do order of magnitude on the amount he eats: The average human eats ~1000kg per year. He's probably eating about 1% of that, or 100kg. His human form weighs something like 250kg, so he can regenerate that with 2.5 years of food. I think his gargoyle form weighs 2.5 tons so he'd need 25 years of food to regenerate the whole thing. He doesn't live nearly that dangerously I don't think. I mean, if he had a master who liked using him for target practise he probably wouild need to eat more.

                                  I looked into what sort of elements are in food as opposed to sandstone and they were surprisingly similar. Aluminium and Silicon would be the main differences. There's lots of potassium, sodium and oxygen. He'd have a *ton* of carbon, nitrogen and hydrogen excess if he ate a lot of food as opposed to rocks, though. Heck, maybe he poops diamonds? (Nah, he'd store the carbon to regenerate the organic portions of his body).

                                    Not *really* surprising, considering that plants get a lot of their matter from sand which is just ground-up rocks. (Maybe Julius occasionally crunches his way through an aluminium pot or a handful of computer chips in order to maintain a balanced diet... *that* will probably lead to questions if Red stumbles across him doing so).

I didn't mean literal fingernails; I more meant, his gelatinous blob "blood factory" "rest of the iceberg" probably has the equivilent of long hair/nails: might just be a series of orgasn that hold a bunch of different elements in reserve, like bones do for calcium. 


                                      > An atom? His 3D body could be *entirely disintegrated* and he'd merely shift over one slice 

                                      Nah, I don't think I like that. Long ago I conceived of him having a "heart stone" that was a big red gem in the centre of his body, and if it's destroyed he dies. I assume it's some vital 4D organ that holds him together. But that's an awful lot similar to vampires. Then again, assuming supernatural creatures have some sort of common origin, it's probably actually pretty good that "destroying the heart" works on two different beings. 

                                      It is an interesting idea if we do allow him to survive being bisected. I'd probably rule that he'd end up like a starfish if we did allow that. So now he's pissed off and there's *two* of him - though the far-from-the-gargoyle-side half is going to die of starvation *very* quickly with no ability to photosynthesise (probably in a day or two). And all the flesh on the near-the-gargoyle-side is going to die and rot away with no new blood source. It would be pretty cool though.

                                        Whatever it is, it's got to do so without limiting his combat capability in any way.

                                        Okay, this is reasonable. He must have some vulnerability. (If nothing else, if the bit he does his thinking with is destroyed, then he's not able to do anything even if his body pieces itself back together).

                                        But this heart stone - it doesn't *have* to be part of his 3D human body. (It might very well only be part of his 3D *gargoyle* body, which means that a prospective assassin has to get him to go into full battle-mode - perhaps by destroying his human-shaped "disguise" body - and *then* break through all his outer skin and armour and *then* destroy this tough-as-nails Heartstone. A tall order.)

                                        Hmmmm. But only one side - presumable the gargoyle side - still has a brain. So the gargoyle side prompty shifts to full battle-mode and Deals With whatever just tried to kill him - while the non-gargoyle side regenerates a human body but otherwise kind of just lies there, having no brain to think with (bit of a distraction but not much else). And, once he's safe again, he's lost a massive pile of mass, but hey, there's this big fleshy lump just hanging out into 4D space, ready to be eaten... the whole thing will be pretty gross, but he can get most of his mass back.

                                        Fair enough. But just crunching through an aluminium pot could have happened a long time before computer chips. I don't actually know when aluminium refining started being a thing that could be done...

                                          Oh yeah - I wonder what that is? I never really considered that. Maybe the heartstone *is* the brain? And that's why it's present in all slices, so that they can all be controlled (okay, probably more like a spinal cord: a small heartstone spinal cord in most cross sections with a larger heart stone "brain" in the other, "more important" cross sections - where would they be?). 

                                          His body is shaped like this:

                                          Stone --> Battle --> Human --> Iceberg of flesh

                                          So it'd make most sense for his "brain" heartstone to be in his *stone form*, not his battle form. So you'd have to get him virtually starving so he'd be forced to be in his regenerative stone form, and then destroy all of *that* - which is no doubt the most protected part of him.

                                          But if you destroy any part of his spinal cord stone, he loses control of his body *below* that. The iceberg of flesh still keeps it all alive unless you sever everything, but he's not going to be able to use it. Maybe the spinal cord stone will heal given time, though?

                                          > Hmmmm. But only one side - presumable the gargoyle side - still has a brain.

                                          Yeah, unless we go for him having a distributed brainy-heart-stone-thingy, so he'd be able to control every part of it. I kind of like the possibility of existential angst as he gets severed and the human side realises that he's doomed.

                                          > the whole thing will be pretty gross, but he can get most of his mass back.

                                          Yeah, but with the flesh iceberg severed, unless he can find a 4D surgeon, the fleshy parts of his gargoyle body are going to die. Presumably he'd have a pretty ordinary-looking stone gargoyle body that would allow him to live a more or less normal life, only now hiding is completely impossible and he's not nearly so cuddly </3

                                          1% is probably closer to the right order of magnitude; then again if he eats rocks, those are pretty dang heavy. And when he's in relationships he'd eat just to be polite, so he might be eating 100% if he was in a long-term relationship - or even more as no doubt his son would bring him tasty rocks from time to time.

                                          Looks like it was from the 1890s, so they probably had cheap aluminium in the 1940s onwards. Not sure if Julias would eat garbage in front of his masters though; he'd know from experience that many find it disturbing and would not want to weird them out, after all...

                                            When you mentioned the Heartstone, I assumed that was it - a silicon-based hypercomputer 'brain' would be somewhat stonelike.

                                            Of course, he might use something as advanced beyond silicon as silicon is beyond abacuses; but silicon doesn't seem to cause any trouble.

                                            Doesn't need to be in a slice to control it. Neither your brain nor your spinal cord are in your feet, but you can still wriggle your toes.

                                            > where would they be?

                                            Centre of mass. Most space for heavy armour around it.

                                            Ooooh, yeah, that makes sense. So you'd have to utterly destroy his human form, *and* his battle form, *and then* break through his stone form...

                                            He's a good deal more terrifying as a fighter if the whole of him can (eventually) heal from just the Heartstone and a suitable supply of matter (anyone got a spare planet?)

                                            Hmmm. That's more a case of two hims than one that controls everything, but yes, I can see that working.

                                            Even more existential angst when the gargoyle side tells the human side that he has to eat him to have enough matter to regenerate his *own* fleshy side.

                                            I was assuming that, as long as he had the mass available, his gargoyle side could regrow the fleshy side.

                                              At which point he'd go into battle form and rip the net apart. You could definitely use that idea to do it, though, but he's got some pretty unique ways to deal with whatever situation he's in: lock him in a small room? He can go human, stick his butt against the door, transform into a gargoyle and then his tail is making a hole in the door which he can probably leverage to break through.

                                              You'd be best off with some sort of gauntlet with his master at the other end, tire him out that way. Then again, he might reason that he's doomed either way and he's not going to be able to help any hypothetical future masters otherwise.

                                              Good thought: is he devoted enough to his masters to die for them? Given Blue and Orange Morality, *probably*?

                                              ... maybe his apparent size depends on his total mass. And the reason he's so giant is because he's so heavy. But if you destroy him, he'll come back together but be perhaps only a foot tall? And if he ever eats the moon or whatever, he might be 5% larger?

                                              Probably better to have an iceberg of flesh, just because if he ever accidentally transforms into *that* it would be gross.

                                              Again not sure if that would be possible - how much regeneration can he do? Can he regenerate all his fleshy organs with just the stone side (like a starfish), or does he need the organs that grow flesh in order to regenerate his flesh? Either way, he'd be eating his other half when appropriate.

                                              Here's a family picture I drew in 2005: http://i.imgur.com/W0jTe6E.png - needless to say the mythology has changed over the past 12 years, but the broad strokes are there...

                                              The "father gargoyle" has been redesigned to be Julias who was originally a completely different character, and the son (Malik) has been slightly redesigned too. Malik looks mostly human, and indeed can pass for such with appropriate fashion choices. 

                                              His non human features include bat-like ears, wings with glossy brown feathers (not bat wings as in the picture), and he doesn't grow hair but down. The hair on his head are actually made of tiny long tendril-like feathers, similar to what emus have. The son eats garbage and meat (including human flesh that he buys from demon fast food restaurants regularly).

                                              I think it'd be hard to sneak up on a gargoyle what with their x-ray vision and all, but I get your point.

              This came up in earlier discussions with MagicWeasel - it's how they turn into bats. One end of the four-dimensional vampire is human-shaped, the other end is bat-shaped; sliding back and forth along an axis at right angles to reality allows them to appear to suddenly shrink down to bat size or grow to human size without actually creating/destroying matter.

  I'm sort of tinkering with an urban fantasy story along the much loved trope of monster hunters and an atypical (and rational) vampire. My worldbuilding issue right now is the monster hunter organization. 

  In today's world of CCTVs, mobile phones, NSA surveilance and the internet, maintaining secret headquarters for monster hunting seems difficult if not impossible. Even more so when the monsters may have additional resources. 

  How would you maintain a secret organization of monster hunters in a world much like today, where monsters such as vampires and demons exist, hidden from most. And how would you do to have the solution maintain an air of ancient heritage from a branch of the original Knights Templar or similar? 

  Next question is, how does the *monsters* remain hidden? If the world, or even just a nation state goes to war against a small number of monsters, there can only be one result (why else would the monsters hide instead of rule?). And with the above mentioned information tools, especially the ever present cell phone vidoe cameras, how could they stay hidden? 

  My current line of thought is World of Darkness inspired, in that vampires have infiltrated or influences key positions in leadership and media (including YouTube) to keep the lid on, and most monster factions actively self-police to stay hidden. Does that sound feasible? 

  Any ideas would be greatly appreciated!

    - The organisation has armour and weapons that are in some way extra-potent against monsters (blessed weapons?) but would have fitted right in with ancient European knights, so think swords and so forth

    - In the modern day, members of the organisation claim to be LARPers and insist (should anyone ask) that their weapons are 'merely props'. They tend to avoid going armed into any place where carrying a sword will lead to trouble (e.g. airports).

    - *Some* anti-monster weapons (e.g. silver crucifixes - good against vampires *and* werewolves) are not considered 'weapons' by most security personnel, and can thus be carried into airports or banks should such be necessary

    - Why do the monster *hunters* need to be secret, anyway?

      Thanks!

      Hunters need to be secret because monster are. 

      Also, having large numbers of weapons (modern and medieval, apologies if I made it seem like they were restricted to ancient stuff) and walking around with it raises all kinds of flags, especially in today's age of shootings and terror attacks. 

      I want the kind of secret war often portrayed in urban fantasy novels, but with a bit more plausibility. I keep thinking, "the acronym agencies would be *all over* that".    

      If they can ferret out terrorist cells, how does a group of people that are heavily armed in their day to day work stay secret?
      ```

      - u/CCC_037:

        > Hunters need to be secret because monster are.

        This is a horrible in-story reason.

        If having the monsters revealed to the world will result in them being hunted down and killed, then the Hunters should be deliberately *trying* to reveal the monsters to the world; because successfully revealing the monsters to the world means that they win.

        Plus, then the monster hunters can walk around with weaponry without too much trouble from the acronym agencies (in fact, said acronym agencies would be helping them to find and track monsters).

        --------------

        Alright, so here's a few options to consider that look more sensible to me:

        Option 1: Revealing the existence of monsters won't result in the monsters being wiped out. In fact, no-one's even sure whether or not it will result in the monsters losing the resulting war. What is known is that the resulting war will most likely lead to the deaths of a substantial (80%+) portion of humanity (so the Hunters don't want to trigger it) and *might* lead to the Monsters being wiped out but will certainly lead to them being put to significant trouble (so the Monsters have reason to remain hidden).

        Option 2: The Monsters have already won. They control, directly or indirectly (vampires can hypnotise, right?) every major state and government body. This includes *all* the Acronym Agencies. The only reason humanity is still around is because we're useful to them - the vampires, for example, prefer the taste of human blood. The werewolves might prefer to be able to hunt prey that is intelligent enough to make the hunt *interesting*. (In fact, some werewolves might even deliberately set out to *start* monster-hunting agencies and hire and even arm humans, just so they have reasonably challenging prey).

        Another thought which can combine with either of the above: A lot of monsters are only harmed by special weapons or materials, most of which do not look like weapons (e.g. silver for werewolves - throw a handful of silver coins at a werewolf and you'll do more damage than a hundred iron swords). Since the anti-monster weapons are not the sort of weapons that the anti-terrorism agencies are looking for, they tend not to bother... too much.

    Here is an idea

    * Earth is a very minor unimportant place in the grand scheme of things and like a primitive hunter-gatherer tribe are ignorant of the much larger polities and civilizations around them.

    * A strong relatively nearby major power or coalition has a prime directive of sorts. (This could be for ethical, religious or pragmatic reasons, though it might be better off to leave them relatively unknown.) that gets them to counter and punish obvious attempts at reveals.

    * The nearby major power serves as the patron as the monster hunter organization and supplies the magic or technology needed to equip them, manipulate governments and keep things hidden. 

    There are various ideas you could have for the prime directive. It could be philosophical, religious or pragmatic. For WoD I would expect something like

    *  Every species develops it's own unique magic system if they are allowed to develop it naturally

    *  If a species achieves widespread exposure to another species magic system then they adopt it and lose their ability to develop one naturally.

    *  Local major power became a major power because their magic system enables them to steal magic from other places and they are just waiting for Earth to develop magic before one comes to consume us all.

    As to why the local major power contracts out to humans instead of using normal humans. 

    *  It could because their citizens can't navigate an earth-like environment (e.g size of small city, used to different magical field, or are used to strange geometries)

    * Individuals are all powerful and high quality but they only have a small population and Earth is not worth having a dedicated individual managing it.

    *  They have passive magical effects which would effect our environment

    *  Earth is one of many backwood planets and they are too busy using resources for their own entertainment or a major war to commit more than a token amount of resources.

      > If a species achieves widespread exposure to another species magic system then they adopt it and lose their ability to develop one naturally.

      If the aliens abduct a breeding colony of humans and dump them on another world, can they get two human magic systems from the same species? If so, I expect a lot more alien abductions and mysterious disappearances in this universe...

        The transportation magic would taint the magical field of the breeding colony. If for some reason that didn't apply then you would still have to wait for ages for the new collective magical field to build up and find a stable pattern. If for some reason you waited that long then you would find that the new magical system is not significantly different from and is in fact practically interchangeable with other human magical systems.

          Use non-magical, tech-based spaceships. Keep your breeding colony unconscious during transport, so they have no memory of it.

          > If for some reason that didn't apply then you would still have to wait for ages for the new collective magical field to build up and find a stable pattern.

          Well, yeah. Naturally. But you'd have to wait a good deal less time than it would take for a new intelligent species to develop entirely on its own.

          And it does sound like we're talking about some *extremely* patient aliens here, in any case.

          > If for some reason you waited that long then you would find that the new magical system is not significantly different from and is in fact practically interchangeable with other human magical systems.

          Oooooh... this would be the bit that makes it impractical. (Though, I'd been considering the possibility that separate human colonies that had already found their individual magics might be the origins of things like vampires...)
          ```

            You don't need human colonies for that because magic is infectious. 

            Humans and others without a magical system have raw chaotic magical fields that are constantly interfering with each other as well as any other magic in the area. 
            Systematic magic is magic that has found a stable self-reinforcing configuration. It passively shapes other magic to be more like itself. This doesn't really work on already stable magic. It does work on raw magic but only if there is a lot of exposure (As in the magic was actively used on them or they are surrounded by people with the same system) or if the magic system is particularly suited to the species to question. (In which case the magic system spreads extremely rapidly from passive interactions betweeen magic fields and works much better for that species than others) 

            I would say the vampire aliens have a magic system that allows them to control the people they bite and draw power from their vampiric descendants. They go to a backwater world, bite someone, force their magical system on them and then get them to keep biting others.
