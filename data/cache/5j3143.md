  If you want to encourage people from here to watch the movie, you probably should have mentioned that it was a film adaptation of the short story, *Story of Your Life*, by Ted Chiang.

    Having already read the story (and not realizing the movie was an adaptation of the story until it started and seemed very familiar), I actually found it a bit disappointing knowing what was going to happen.  [ ](#s "But I guess that's appropriate considering the theme of the story.")
    ```

      ```
      Agreed. Apparently [people who see the movie without reading the story first](#s "think the scenes with the little girl are a flash*back* rather than a flash*forward*, which provides a nice twist on the 'woman scientist can't science because she has a traumatic past' trope")
      ```

  I recommend seeing the Arrival too - it's a solid movie - although it does dumb down the story a bit.
  ```

  - u/MagicWeasel:
    ```
    I think it completely misses some of the most important themes of the story by changing one relatively small element! [Particularly,](#s " in the short story, the daughter dies in a rock climbing accident (preventable) whereas in the movie she dies of some sort of disease (not preventable). Added to that the knowledge of the general's phone number being propagated back in time, it kind of kills what I thought was the main theme, which was that the protagonist knowing the future required the loss of free will.")

        I agree, the adaption was really good, considering! I agree on your point about what they did with Renner's character, and excluding the science lesson. Some cool hollywood visuals would have really made it awesome!
        ```

      [I don't know about that first point](#s " I saw the movie before I ever read the short story, so I didn't know the original point of it was that the death was supposed to be preventable, but I still took away that basic point. They *could* have simply not had the daughter to begin with, and they wouldn't have had to deal with the grief of losing her. That's what I thought the husband was upset about, later on.")

      [The main thing I have a problem with the movie glossing over is](#s " the reveal that the Heptapods already knew English. After seeing the movie, one of my main problems with it was that they seemed to still need to teach the Heptapods how to understand English, despite it effectively being a Stable Time Loop. However, in the short story, this is explained in a single sentence of narration, right near the beginning.")
      ```

      - u/MagicWeasel:
        ```
        In response to the first point, in the book, using the movie's logic, she could have [](#s "had the daughter and then told her never to go rockclimbing (telling her she dies at 23 in a climbing accident should do it!), thus preventing her death. In the movie, she had to have the daughter (who was doomed to die) or not have the daughter. She doesn't have the opportunity of the third choice of having the daughter but preventing the death.")
        ```

          Or she could have had IVF and screened the embryos for susceptibility to that disease. Or only allowed embryos which had genetic characteristics which would make them entirely different to the vision-of-the-future child.
          ```

          - u/CreationBlues:
            ```
            [My problem with the movie was](#s " you should either be able to solve your problems with time travel or you shouldn't. Not having humans to save you in 3000 years? Sure thing. Entire world devolving into nuclear holocaust? Fix it with a phone call. Dying due to some people planting a bomb and refusing to say to these scientists "lol there's a bomb behind you talk to you in 10"? Kid dying due to cancer and either not having her at all, or using the amazing power to get news from 3000 years in the future to get a cancer cure? Nope, not options.")

            It's like the movie tries to say you can prevent BIG BAD THINGS from happening, but you're on your own for the small travesties, because reasons????
            ```

          - u/MagicWeasel:
            ```
            That's true, but you don't have the knee-jerk "oh my god she could have saved her so easily!" sort of reaction like you do with the accident. It happens on a smaller scale in the story, too - she remembers a salad bowl falling on her kid's head and making her cry, and then that same day she's in a supermarket and she sees the salad bowl. She decides to buy it, even though all she knows about that bowl is that it hits her kid in the head and makes her cry.

            Plus, the point was that she *loved* her vision-of-the-future child. If your Favourite Person (partner, kid, parent, Eliezer Yudkowsky, whatever) were to suddenly get hit by a bus and die horribly, and I said, "hey, I'm Omega, I can make it so that person never lived. You will forget about them, but they wouldn't have died young in that bus accident" - you'd be like, "no, I love them, I remember them, and although our time was cut tragically short I would rather have a little than none of it". Louise *remembers her future*, so she loves that little girl just as much as you'd love your own kid. 

            Can you imagine going back in time and deliberately stopping yourself from conceiving a child you *already have raised for 10+ years*, by, say, making yourself have sex 10 seconds later so a different sperm meets the egg? Sure, you'd probably love that new kid just as much as the original one, but you would lose *that* kid.

              Well, I can, yes, but then again I don't tend to have the same visceral reactions to such things that most people do.
              ```

- u/Geminii27:
  ```
  I've seen it. I like the alien parts, the language, the antigrav, etc. I didn't like the B-plot with the future child or the idea that speaking a different language allows you to break physics. Wasn't a fan of the unsubtle pro-US-military-above-all approach, either.

  I'll admit I haven't read the book - that might bring it together more smoothly.
  ```

  - u/MagicWeasel:
    ```
    The book completely removes the military angle and the part about the child becomes the A-plot (and far more compelling!), and the language doesn't let you break physics. It's a short story, not a book, and it's *very* good, so I would absolutely recommend it.
    ```
