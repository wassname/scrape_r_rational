## Mother of Learning, confusion about trans continental travel

### Post:

I am not sure if I understood the mechanics employed by Z&Z to get to distant continents correctly, so I will lay out what I think happens:

* Bakora gates used by arinae - To use these one must have the ritual and the password for that specific gate. Z&Z travel around and gather passwords for these gates when they are physically present to inspect a new gate. Now can they just give the new passwords to the arinae web in another restart and the gates would work? Don't they have to be physically present at the new gate to activate it?

* Using interdimensional gate spells - I am under the impression that it requires that 2 casters be present at each end of the gate/portal. So this would be a huge time sink if Zorian makes one of his simulcrums to travel using more mundane means and then open the portal. It would imply that to get to Koth they would have to wait for the simulcrum to reach there in a weeks time and then open the gate. Somehow I think this isn't how it happens.

So my question is basically how much time do Z&Z spend going to an already traversed distant location in subsequent restart and could someone please explain the mechanics of these long distance travelling magic?

  As far as I can tell, it's just a matter of knowing the password.  They have to visit any new gate once, to *get* the password, but that's it.  Any gate they've already been to in the loop, they don't have to visit again.

  They were shown as being present at the *old* gate the first time they gave a password to the Silent Doorway Adepts, because neither side trusted the other.  But now that they know what they're doing, it's just a matter of giving the Adepts the password, and they're able to go to that gate.

  I think you're right that you need someone on each side.  However, if you can send a simulacrum through a Bakora Gate, that cuts down the vast majority of the travel time required to get the much-more-convenient Gate spell working.

  That said, I could be wrong about that; [Ch 99](https://m.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/99/) mentions Zorian's ability to open a gate to Koth "at will" a couple of times, in such a way that it sounds like a simulacrum doesn't have to be on the other side.  However, I don't remember him ever acquiring that ability.
  ```

  - u/Banarok:
    ```
    personally i think the "at will" is due to him always having a simulacrum over there, and since he can contact any of his simulacrum by soul messaging it effectively become "at will"
    ```

    - u/Nimelennar:
      ```
      It's possible, but I really don't get that impression.

      Simulacra are mana-drains, so Zorian is limited in the number he can have.  With the Bakora gate so convenient, why would he waste one sitting around doing nothing in Koth?
      ```

      - u/Banarok:
        ```
        several reasons, one the Tarmantula give him access to spells that he can't really get his hands on in Cyoria so it's another orchard of low hanging fruit when it comes to useful spells, it can also build stuff there without fearing intervention from anyone that "matters" aka knew him before he got so good at spell formula.

        Damien was usually there with his fiance and while he traveled around Cyoria i'm pretty sure he needed to go back, requiring Zorian to keep a simulacrum there.

        Bakora gates are far from THAT convenient, they take a lot of mana to activate and a lot of chanting spiders to hope they get the request right, and it could take anywhere from 30 min to hours, they also require Zorian to teleport to their web, bribe them & supply them with crystals enough for the portal to have enough mana since their bakora gate is in a pretty low ambient mana area.

        Having a simularcum in Koth give him a perfect escape route from anywhere since he know nobody will be able to teleport to follow him, meaning it's a perfect retreat spell.

        I'm sure there are more good reasons those are just the ones at the top of my head.

          ```
          Minor clarification: the convoluted Bakora Gate ritual is only necessary without a password, which is why Zorian was able to revolutionize things for the aranae after he went password collecting
          ```

          - u/Banarok:
            ```
            nope that's where you're wrong, the ritual is always needed, without the password you can't travel to that gate period that's why they were not able to go to especially many places at all before he collected the passwords, that's also why they were so eager for passwords for areas they can't normally acess, if they could travel there with the gate anyway it would never have been a issue.

            in real the ritual is crap, it's a makeshift solution since the real one is lost to time, and Zorian have so far not mentioned any way of skipping the "ritual".
            ```

  - u/xachariah:
    ```
    During the period where Zorian was watching the Silent Doorway Adepts, I remember him trying to puzzle out and find the underlying mechanics, and using those mechanics to power the bi-directional simulacrum gate.  

    Is he able to do them mismatched, where there's a simulacrum on one side, and a bokoran gate w/ password on the other?

    Either that or Zorian's just running so many simulacra that he's everywhere.
    ```

    - u/tst619:
      ```
      Yeah both seem plausible, but it would waste so mucg time to get all those simulacrums in the correct place. It feels like Z&Z spend almost a week or two preparing everything.
      ```

  - u/tst619:
    ```
    Thank you so much for this. 

    > hey were shown as being present at the old gate the first time they gave a password to the Silent Doorway Adepts, because neither side trusted the other.

    I didn't notice that it was more of a trust issue rather than the underlying magical limitation.

    > I think you're right that you need someone on each side. However, if you can send a simulacrum through a Bakora Gate, that cuts down the vast majority of the travel time required to get the much-more-convenient Gate spell working.

    That would cut down the time yes, but many times Zorian is shown to just open the dimensional gates without mentioning the simulacrum at the adjoining gate. Now it is entirely possible that the simulacrums *are* present just not mentioned because it's not that important. But take chapter 83 for example when they have that fight with QI, only Z&Z attack him and none of simulacrums are even mentioned. I find this instance pretty glaring, so I guess Zorian can just straight up open gates like you mentioned about chapter 99, but again I dont recall him having that ability.

    I do however remember that he was modifying/optimising gate spells after studying QI's gate, bakora gates and mixing coaching instructions from Xhim and Silverlake. So I guess he might just have that ability to straight up open intercontinental gates.
    ```

    - u/Areign:
      ```
      Yeah there's also a number of times he goes into black rooms and later contacts damien that stand out since his simulacra would have been destroyed by the room.

      My understanding was that he learned to do it to places he was familiar by modifying the spell that required a simulacra on the other side.
      ```

      - u/thrawnca:
        ```
        I'm pretty sure the author fixed the black-room-destroys-simulacrums plothole; he either coordinated with Daimen in advance, or just sent another simulacrum. If you find a case that doesn't work, you should post it.
        ```

      - u/tst619:
        ```
        Makes sense, I was also getting that feeling but wasn't sure.
        ```

        - u/Areign:
          ```
          working on my final reread and i think i can at least a new reference relating to your question.

          the first mention of the modified gate spell is when he talks to silverlake (in chapter 74)

          >Zorian smiled. That was only natural. After all, Zorian’s gate creation skills were a fusion of more orthodox gate creation skills that Xvim had taught him, as well as the insights Zorian had made from studying the Ibasan permanent gates and seeing the Bakora Gates in action. He doubted many people had had the opportunity to study so many different gate creation methods.

          >...

          >“Throw in that modified Gate spell of yours and we have a deal,” Silverlake said.

          the 'modified' aspect would imply its not just the basic spell he's been using with simulacra and the reason he can do it is all the other gates and dimensionalism he's studied. I wish it was more clearly stated but there it is.

          Edit: ugh

          Now in chapter 79 Zach makes the gate because he left a simulacrum in eldemar....I take back what I said above
          ```

    I think that once they have the bakora gate password, they send a simulacrum through to the other side, and the simulacrum stays there for the rest of the restart.
    ```

- u/Keshire:
  ```
  A lot of people forget the gates are semi sentient. Like the sovereign gate. If the password itself acts like a coordinate system or phone number then the gates can contact each other regardless of anyone being present. The only reason some would need to physically travel to a gate is to get its code once.
  ```
