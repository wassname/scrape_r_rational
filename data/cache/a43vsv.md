## [PGTE] On Genocides of Catherine Foundling: Tasteless Review of Book 4

### Post:

This has been the most dissapointing book of the Guide so far, in my opinion. Catherine keeps making stupid moves, and keeps getting away with it. In every single confrontation she achieves her most important goal perfectly, and only "loses" in ones that are third or lower in her preference ranking. She keeps being granted enormous advantages (Winter mantle, being friends with dead king, having access to thousands of drow), barely uses any of them, and then proceeds to not lose her next confrontation anyways. To make things worse, her character is stuck on the same bloody arc for the past two books (get into fight, get hurt, angst about not being human anymore, reject humanity for the last time pinkie promise, get powerup) with no end in sight. 

Let's start with the utter lack of experimentation on Catherine's part.

Book started out pretty well too. Catherine was getting to kill some heroes, her being stronger than before was clearly demonstrated, it was implied she was collecting dead heroes for some sort of doomsday plan - perhaps raising them as undead, Dead King style. Then came the crusaders with their fancy pants army, and there was a nice scary moment where it was revealed that 12 whole heroes of unknown capabilities would be going against Cat, who, in the interlude, was not strong enough to instantly overwhelm just 3 mediocre ones (paladin, swashbuckler, and the fire mage). Cat was using her powers creatively enough, which all culminated with the Battle of the Camps where Cat dropped a lake onto an army. In a move seemingly stronger than what any fey below the level of Kings and Queens have pulled in the last book, it was clearly demonstrated that Cat did, in fact, have a huge reservoir of power to tap into, even if you could guess she wasn't using it to the full capacity (like Ubua).

Then came Keter.

First warning bell actually went off a little before the party arrived in Keter, when Catherine was arbitrarily reshaping Ubua's body image. All that it took for her to learn the trick was for someone else to suggest the possibility, and that was that. It already suggested a whole new dimension of possible tactical uses of Winter - could Catherine make her arms longer mid-swing, or just make herself 3 feet taller at all times for extra reach? Could she change the appearance of other fey, and make them look like mortals for infiltration purposes? But that was all relatively minor, up until the point where Catherine up and turned to mist.

Wait, wait, hold the fuck up. Mist? She can just *do* that? 

Well, okay. Did it at least take something time or resource intensive, like jacking into a bigger well of power, having her soul hacked to improve her finesse with magic, stealing memories of a lifetime of wielding magic from a mage, or something similarily difficult?

No, not really. She just, like, tries it. It works immediately, no training or experimentation necessary. In the middle of combat, no less, where she would be maximaly distracted, so it can't take all that much focus and concentration either. 

And yet she did not have this trick for the crusader fight, where it would have been really useful. Meaning that neither she, nor any of her close friends, so much as suggested she try anything of the sort in the *months* between Liesse and crusader army arriving. Juniper "First thing I ask when I find out you are half fey is how well your winter powers can help preserve our supply train" Hellhound did not suggest Cat experiment with possibly *the* strongest weapon their side has to see where it's limits are. Masego did not try to poke at the limitations of her body. Cat herself didn't try increasing her height by sheer accident during one of her angsty rants about how short she is.

Cat had ability to arbitrarily reshape her form(she also grows wings later) and function at any time for *months*, but just was too blindingly stupid to realise it.

Fine, fine. At least she realises this now. Does she learn the general lesson of "Your power is not fully explored, and you desperately need extra functionality because your kingdom is on fire"?

Nope. She needs to go to the drow and *again* start trying things mid combat with agonising slowness to figure anything new out. Instead of jumping from "I can make wings" to "I wonder what are the limits of modifying the topology of my body" she just... stops at wings and regrowing limbs. Can she turn herself into a dust speck, while preserving speed and power (She constantly mentions how those don't rely on muscles), and just shoot herself through the heads of enemies, impossible to hit or hurt? Can she grow 20 tentacles 40 meters long and smash people from far away instead of relying on measly two hands and a *sharp piece of iron*? If her body is just an avatar for Winter power, can she make a second one, hand it to a minion, and effectively "teleport" across the battlefield by shifting her awareness from one body to another? Hell, can she use multiple bodies at once? Who the hell knows. Certainly not Catherine.

With how badly she is using her power, it's honestly a wonder she didn't get killed by a passing kitten.

This is all just body manipulation. Now let's talk Gates. Back during Battle of The Camps, Catherine opens one (1) gate above the army, with special help from Masego in order to make it allign with the lake. It is heavily implied this is incredibly difficult to achieve, takes a minute to do and flat out impossible without an assisting mage. Then, in the recent fight this happens:

>The first gate opened in front of the Night construct, and it slowed by a fraction as it prepared to leap over it. That was enough. Another two, caging it in a triangle. Another two, above and below. All of them leading to the bottom of the Fields of Wend, that depthless glacier lake at the very heart of Winter. 

[I count five gates](https://youtu.be/U1Psm3H54Ek?t=18s), simultaneously, to the same lake, opened in less time than what it would have took for the supernaturally fast panther drow to get out of dodge. With *zero* power growth in between. This leaves two possibilities:

* Catherine had the power to do it back then, but it would have dunked her into alienation like a cookie into milk, and trick with Masego was meant to prevent that. Now she can dump alienation onto drow, and thus can pull this off.

* Catherine, in her sheer blinding stupidity, honestly believed it was supposed to be "hard" to do this, because she still thought she was a mortal and not a damn Queen of Winter. Sadly, this alligns far too well with her character "growth" for me to dismiss this.

That's number and speed of Gates. In another chapter she opens a Gate *through* a stone column, implying Gates can cut things. Would sure have been nice to know this during the battle of the camps, where you could have opened the big gate five meters underground beneath the enemy army, making it much harder to target by enemies, leaving them less time to react, and leaving behind much more mud and water (water under enough pressure to squish drow into mush would have broken through mere five meters of earth easily, leaving behind a five meter deep lake of mud, *definitely* drowning anyone that was left there). What about other things planar travel can do? In yet another chapter, this happens:

> My Lord of Silent Steps moved with unnatural agility, waiting until the bone trident had struck out before… moving. The description failed to convey what had taken place, though. One moment it’d been standing in the way of the weapon, the next it’d been behind the Mighty and striking with its own glass staff. Afterimages followed a heartbeat later, revealing how it had moved and the whole affair reeked of Winter.

>It’d skimmed the edge of Arcadia, I realized with a start.

Well what do you know, you don't even need proper gates if you try using the power properly.

"But melmonella", I hear you say, "maybe she tried all the various tricks, but couldn't do any of them because she lacks education in magic and couldn't dump alienation onto a small army. With limitations like that, how can you blame her?"

Well, a flat metal plate on a door can be pushed, and a handle on a door can be pulled, and limitations usually can be overcome. So let's see if there were any easy, obvious tricks Catherine could have done to overcome one or both of these drawbacks.

Oh look, she can tear memories out of people, and uses that to learn Corpuscular from Ubua. She knew about this trick way back then too, as she used it during her assault on the Procer camp with the Wild hunt to sift through the memories of her soldier and locate the officer tent. And she had an incredibly talented disposable mage tied to her collar. Meaning she could have ripped all that knowledge out of Ubua's mind at any time. Ubua mentions that her experience with Diabolism lets her handle winter alienation better than Catherine, so Catherine's usable powerset would have flatly expanded.

There is **no good reason** for Catherine to have remained utterly ignorant of magic for all this time. That ignorance lead to her underutilising her power during the battle of the camps, leading to thousands of her soldiers being utterly slaughtered.

But what about alienation? Surely she couldn't have figured out a way to deal with that?

Well, no, she totally could have. She had a small army of borderline fanatical folowers at her disposal. One call for volunteers to accept titles would have given her hundrends if not thousands of willing title holders, boosting her alienation resistance levels up to what she had after absorbing her first few sigils. Them being volunteers would have also neatly sidestepped any "villain forces people into magic slavery" storylines. Oh, and she'd get a fey analogue to the Watch out of the deal too, *again* boosting the power of her army by the time Battle of The Camps rolled around, and *again preventing thousands of unnecesary casualties.* Which would have been a good idea regardless of wherever or not alienation could be dumped on them, but I digress.

But surely she didn't know that she could dump alienation onto others before she did it with Ubua by sheer accident?

And that is why you experiment with all your new powers, instead of just assuming what they do in advance. Granting a title to just several experimental subjects (not to mention a thousand volunteers) would have allowed her( if she tore sorcery knowledge out of Ubua's mind, or, alternatively, Masego) to notice the dump of alienation onto other title holders as soon as she tried exerting herself, instead of waiting for Dead King *and* Ubua to metaphorically beat her on the head with the idea.

Practically every personal trick she discovered in this book could have been researched before the Battle of The Camps rolled around. Given that Catherine was making easy pickings of the heroes on display there, and that she was at least close enough to Saint in the power level to not immediately die, it's not unfeasible that she could have soloed the whole army herself if she was more powerful. You could even say that **every single Callowan death** in Battle of The Camps has been caused by Catherine deciding that using her powers effectively was for boring people.

I'd mention exploits you could do with vows, memory manipulation, domains or other things Catherine is apparently natively capable of, but this thing is already getting too long. Instead, let's focus on the most blatant example of world bending itself over backwards to suit Catherine so far, which is her fight with Sve Noc inside Sve Noc's soul.

Let's see what we know up to the moment where Cat loses Winter. 

* Catherine is an incompetent buffoon when it comes to magic in general and utilising her own power specifically.

* Sve Noc has centuries of knowledge and experience at using magic in general and Night specifically

* Sve Noc is blatantly more powerful than Catheirne in what she can throw around, if only because Catherine is jobbing so much.

* Sve Noc has such control over magic, that while *inside* Catherine's domain(where, presumably, Cat would be natively stronger) and losing a magic fight she manages to cut Catherine's soul up to the point where Cat loses all Winter.

Now let's see what happens after Catherine becomes mortal again:

* Catherine gets a mortal body. Somehow. If her previous one was made entirely of Winter, where did this one come from? Was it conveniently stored somewhere, ready to pop out and catch Cat's soul in the event of catastrophic winter failure? Does Winter, if it fails, always reconstruct your mortal body just before exploding?

* Catherine gets into a "metaphorical" fight *inside* Sve Noc's soul (where, presumably, Sve Noc would be natively stronger) and *wins*. Let me repeat, Catherine, with little to no experience at magic, wins in a magic-based fight against an immortal millenia old goddess. After she *lost* a similar fight inside *her own domain*. And after losing whatever power she had availible to her. And with no gain of knowledge in the meantime.

Let me quote some things from that fight:

>Smoke was inhaled by gaping maw, the maw escaped by a scuttling rat, the rat crushed by boot only for mud to stick at the bottom of the sole. 

How does Cat know that becoming a rat helps against maws? How is she holding her own against a bloody goddess? Where is she suddenly getting all this knowledge for how to wage a fight inside someone else's soul? I dunno, it just works, I guess. Whole fight is Hollywood hacking perosnified as far as our understanding how any of this funcitons, and Cat essentially wins because of plot armor. This is even worse than turning into mist, since here she doesn't even have Winter to guide her actions. Frankly, instead of reading that paragraph, you'd be better off just watching [this](https://youtu.be/ZTwCtQIEswM).

This fights follows a pretty long sequence of things mysteriously working out in Cat's favor even though she is horribly underutilising every single advantage she has. Let's look at the previous things she did in this book.

What were Cat's strategic objectives in Battle of The Camps? Get crusaders out of Callow, get Callow a breather for a while, ensure her army doesn't get completely obliterated, survive. What did she achieve? Exactly that. Where did she lose? Well, she lost a bit too many troops, and Pilgrim maybe possibly set a vague redemption story arc that might kill her in a year or more.

What were Cat's strategic objectives in coming to Keter? Ensure Procer gets backstabbed so it doesn't even look in Callow's direction for a while, figure out what Dead King wants with her, survive and not lose any Woe. All of them, achieved. Cat even got an unintended powerup out of the deal. Where did she lose? Well, *she* didn't sign the treaty with DK, and instead Malicia did so, for slightly more brutal terms. Which is arguably another win, since now Malicia and not Cat has a "Let DK out of the box" damocles story sword over her head. And that deal might turn out to be negative to Cat in the long term if Malicia turns DK against Cat. Again, full win in short term, vague possibly negative consequences in long term.  

Catherine always gets exactly what she wants while putting in the minimum amount of effort. Screams of thousands of innocents dying for no reason can be heard in the background. I have no doubt that she would get Sve noc on her side with liberal application of Friendship No Jutsu too, and would continue to angst about sacrificing oh so very much while actually doing oh so very little.

But enough about her objectives. Let's talk about her character. 

Who is Catherine Foundling, really? Well, let's see what her positive and negative qualities are. In Book 1, she was a brutish pit fighter with a snarky streak, who was inexperienced at all the various magical and esoteric stuff, and was willing to make tough choices if that got her what she wanted, which was safety and independance for Callow. Now we are three books later, so she is a budding professional at dealing with magic, and has accquired a wealth of combat experience, thus ra - 

Wait, sorry, give me a second, I have a call on another line. Yes, melmonella speaking. What is it? She is what? What do you mean no desire to learn? Oh my. Alright, thank you for your call.

Well what do you know. Catherine *still* has not the foggiest idea about what magic is. Indeed, she jokes about her lack of knowledge in various fields constantly, which would be endearng if it wasn't so bloody aggravating because it shows her total inability to prioritise her learning (and thus, her personal power, and thus, the safety of her kingdom) over short-term fun. How many people intensely dislike, say, Philosophy, yet manage to keep attention in university class enough to pass the required course? Well, all those people have a better attention span than Catherine, who could not keep herself awake through various characters (as far as I remember, at least Killian and Masego attempted, and possibly Archer) giving her lectures on magic, which could literally be a difference between life and death in her line of work. 

Best as I can tell, only skill of Catherines that grew throughout the books was her ability to kill things with a piece of metal, which brings her to the level of ability of an average rifle. Not rifleman, rifle.

And let's mention her continuing arc of rejecting her humanity for power. (I bloody well hope it's completed now that she is mortal again, though with how conservative Catherine tends to be I can just see her picking up another source of immortality and starting on the same arc again.) To my counting, it happened at least four times by now. First somewhere around Liesse, where Catherine ripped at her soul to murder Ubua. Second, during the Battle of The Camps, if memory serves, when she got back from her magic coma. Third, in Keter, when she learned to turn to Mist and such. And several more times in the Underdark. Every single time she goes through the same motions - she needs more magical power, so she rejects her humanity (with much angsting about how good it must be to be mortal and full of lice, and ignoring that she has a *bloody country* to look after), which allows her to go over one conceptual block or another and allows her to use her powers more efficiently. And each time Catherine treats it like this grand revelation *even if it already happened before*. Girl, get it over with already.

Of course, what would Catherine be without a dash of hypocrisy. Let's take the most recent chapter:

>I forgive her for it. And Akua, well, she was raised in a bucket even more vicious than this one. She’s still learning to let go of those blinders. You, though? I’m disappointed that at no point you figured out you could simply ask.

>How much could we have avoided if instead of clawing at each other we’d sat down and talked?

Kettles who live in glass houses should not throw bricks at pots for being black, Catherine. Remind me, for how long did you discuss your goals with Malicia once you became queen of Callow? Did you, mayhaps, attempt to settle on a good old-fashioned compromise? Callow gets independence, Praes gets food, with terms enforced by oaths? Or did you decide that virtue signaling about how terrible Malicia was for funding Liesse was more important than lives of your own subjects?

Those assassinations Malicia performed? Yeah, your fault. Should have visited a marriage councelor before that relationship broke down that far.

In Keter, did you talk to Malicia, and arrange a deal where you agree to not fight so that Dead King can't bring down your prices by playing one of you against another? You literally had the same general goal of "get Dead King to attack procer", it's hard to pick an easier spot for compromise. Or did you jump straight to assassination as first responce policy?

"But that was my mantle, it totally controlled my thoughts and made me uncreative and stuff!"

No, sorry, Catherine. Stupid was in you all along. Komena said it best:

>You could, at least, attempt a believable lie. ‘Nike, she’s not even held her half of the Garden for a decade. The drift would be negligible. It was still her. The only difference was that she had power enough to cow her foes.

I do wonder what would be the stupidest thing Catherine does in this book. Currently she is up to tens of thousands of innocent deaths. At least Diabolist was going somewhere with her own genocide, instead of making it happen due to sheer bloody obliviousness.

    Not necessarily agreeing with op, but I would argue that the world building from the drow arc is basically the definition of non-rational. With the fact that you have basically armies of god level drow stretches belief, especially when they have not gone to the surface despite every incentive to do so.

    - u/ICB_AkwardSituation:
      ```
      I've seen this opinion that the Drow staying where they are and only sometimes harrassing people is non-rational when it's been established in story why they have been forced to stay in the everdark. I'm not sure if it's been explicitly stated but the narrative has been hammering home on the fact that the Drow can't leave the everdark because of the night. They can survive outside of the night which is why they made raids, but due to the curse of Sve Noc and the night they can not survive up there. 

      They can't make massive raids on the surface because there is no night there. The Dead King is held in his kingdom unless someone offers him a way out, it's the same thing with the Drow. They can't leave the everdark because they are shackled there by the curse of immortality that Sve Noc brought them. Why is it so hard to imagine that the Drow are held in the night due to the curse that Sve Noc brought them when the Dead King can be withheld due to the shackles of his immortality in the exact same way. The only difference is that the Dead King was smart about it and was successful in his ascension.

  In fairness, she is a bit busy doing other stuff. She doesn't have endless time for experimentation and emulating Masego.   


  Not immediately trusting/diving into things with Akua was also probably wise. She might have to run the risk now, but trusting Akua isn't something anyone ought to do unless truly desperate.

    It took her, what, a second to learn to turn into mist? She doesn't have a dozen seconds a day?

    > Not immediately trusting/diving into things with Akua 

    Who said anything about trust? Rip knowledge out of her mind, you don't need consent. She started using her for negotiations with Procer pretty early, no reason to be coy about it.
    ```

    - u/TheAzureMage:
      ```
      She frequently takes bigger risks in combat, when she has few other, or at least better, options that she would not take otherwise. This is certainly not her first instance of leaning into risks in combat. 

      In addition, a great deal of her increasingly large uses of power were enabled by the addition of lots of expendables to offload alienation unto. Your premise that she could have just as well used Callowans ignore the story problems of doing so. By using her own people as expendables to further empower herself, she'd be leaning into the sorts of stories of Empresses past, and heading down a path that will inevitably lead to failure. 

      Giving Akua any leash at all comes with dangers. So far, she's been gradually accepting more and more of that danger in return for the utility granted. This is already pretty risky, but it's not as if better options exist. It's also been explicitly stated that going to full on mindrape levels with Akua would initiate the kind of monster-abuse story that results in the monster breaking its chain and destroying her. 

      So in both cases, we have remarkably good reasons in terms of story/name lore why doing as you suggest would be straight up suicide.
      ```

      - u/melmonella:
        ```
        Indeed, and no other mages exist in her entire kingdom who would be willing to share the knowledge with her. She doesn't delete the knowledge she takes, since Ubua didn't need to re-learn Drow language, so she could have asked Masego for that part too. Didn't even need to do memory stuff for a few magic lectures.

        As for alienation, she doesn't sacrifice people she dumps it onto, just temporarily makes them think a bit differently. And I already mentioned volunteers for countering story bait.
        ```

        - u/TheAzureMage:
          ```
          There are other mages who could educate her a bit in general. It is deeply unlikely that there are other mages in her entire kingdom that can tell her what Winter can do in full. If it's at the level of Masego/Akua/Warlock not fully understanding it, then random mage on the street is deeply unlikely to be helpful. 

          You're missing the point that it's a fundamental aspect of the story that Stories have power, and both of your suggestions run afoul of that, and are called out as doing so in the book itself. 

          Merely minimizing it as "just temporarily makes them think a bit differently" isn't addressing the problem with your ideas. 

          A Cat who treated Callowans as she did the Drow, volunteerism or not, would be following a story that is guaranteed to end in death. Even for the Drow, it was kinda pushing fate towards risking her own death, but there's a lot more latitude in behavior when dealing with evil opposition than stripping the free will from one's own followers. The latter is the sort of capital E evil that gets you on a fast track towards being Akua. Loads of power, right up until your heart gets ripped out.

      > Who said anything about trust? Rip knowledge out of her mind, you don't need consent. She started using her for negotiations with Procer pretty early, no reason to be coy about it.

      Yeah, the story really should have defined the limitations on that power.

      I can kind of imagine explanations for why it's totally safe to extract an entire language from Akua's mind, but extracting her strategic, arcane, diplomatic and historical acumen from it isn't and Cat instead has to give Akua increasing amounts of independence and leverage (like, maybe she could only extract the language knowledge because it was recently learned, or maybe Akua's political skills are deeply tied to her philosophical outlook and you can't have one without the other), but it's still pretty odd that nobody seems to even consider it.

      I mean, "extract every useful skill from Akua's soul, while she feels it happening, without her consent, and leave only a sentient husk behind that's just smart enough to understand how much it lost" is a pretty straightforward way to fulfill Catherine's promises to Akua and Vivienne; everyone who hears of it would spread the story of *Akua's Folly, and the Woe that came from it*.

      (also, that's personal bias, but I really wish the story would outgrow Akua already; my opinion of her matches Assassin-disguised-as-Black's)

        This is a series that went to great pains to tell the protagonist and audience that it is a terrible idea to use a magic sword stolen from the previous owner, but people need an explanation for why the protagonist is hesitant to rely on *knowledge and experiences* forcefully stolen from someone else's mind?

        Now there is an idea that might as well have "backfire" blazoned across it in glowing letters.

          And how is it safe to use that knowledge and experience *by having Akua manage her own drow army*?

            > Then why is it safe to extract a language from her mind?

            Because it is a single instance, rather then being repeated. Because it is information freshly learned, not something foundational to Akua's identity. Because it is only a language, not something as complicated as magic or intimate as her innermost thoughts.

            Notice Cat didn't hesitate to make use of William's sword in the battle where she claimed it, but made sure to shatter it afterwards. There is a difference between making use of something before moving on and trying to keep using it regularly, becoming reliant on it in the process.

            > And how is it safe to use that knowledge and experience by having Akua manage her own drow army?

            >Especially since "get the chained monster to rebel against her master" is how Cat defeated Akua in the first place.

            It absolutely isn't. Using Akua is a gamble, but it is one she has prepared contingencies and countermeasures for, unlike becoming the Villainous Mind Leech.

          Masaego wouldn't though, and you are venturing into the realm of contrivance for rationalities sake, in the end PGTE is still a story and has to be an enjoyable one, if Cat could learn everything she does in non-threatening and easy ways, the story would be boring as hell, as she would just be horribly over powered.

          Cat *does* work out how to use her mantle to great effect with Masaego, that's what absolute positioning is, you know, the ability to drop a 100 tons of water and ice on her enemies from the comfort of her home?

  I'm kind of weirded out how this post is called the "Genocides of Catherine Foundling" but it barely even engages with the fact that the entire plot with the Drow is her going on a rampage of colonialist adventurism to enslave a species with winter magic in order to use them as a disposable army against her enemies.

    ```
    I mean, Cat calls *herself* out on that shit.

- u/None:
  ```
  Unlikely and implausible stuff happening because the plot demands it, rather than because of forethought or logic, is kind of a main theme of PGTE. E.g. Iast minute power ups during boss fights despite a character having arguably not earned them are par for the course.

  It's often fun how PTGE recognizes these tropes (and even has the characters go so far as to plan around such things, like with the "rule of three") but at the end of the day if you find these tropes unsatisfying then a fair bit of PTGE is going to be irksome. The Black Knight was the most rational actor IMO, and now that he's stepped off the stage other characters are going to lean on more "rule of cool" and "literary railroading" style methods. (For the former see Thief being used to "Steal" a miniature sun, and using this improbability as the lynchpin for a battle plan.) 

  PTGE is a pretty good story all told but not one where you should expect the protag to inventory their tools/goals, put together an optimized plan given said resources, and then execute the plan to the best of their ability, a la The Waves Arisen. At least not in real time in a way that is transparent to readers. 


  TLDR: Someone on this sub once commented that Worm wasn't rational fiction but was at least firmly "rationally adjacent", and I think the same is true of PTGE.
  ```

  - u/signspace13:
    ```
    Worm has a very rational protagonist in a world that gives 0 shits about her, I would say that PGTE has a few rather rational individuals and a world that is *explicitly* built against them. 

    Cat is rational in a very different way to Black. Black is all about following the path of most resistance in order to turn the story on its head, and just being so good at it that he is terrifying. Cat is almost instinctively aware of the story layer, and instead of banging her head on a brick wall like Black does, she tries to manipulate the story in the direction she chooses, and is very good at it.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      Your last sentence makes a good bit of sense. 

      Rational thought/action in a world like PTGE - where "narrative causality" (or w/e) is as fixed a rule as gravity - would probably look very different than rationality in the real world.

          The main focus of the above rant appears to be :its the stuff of stories:
          .
          Yes, that has been lampshaded all through the story. The world is -canonically- based on tropes! All of the characters who are trying to manipulate events in their own favour *explicitly* plan around making the trope they desire the one which occurs.
          Eg: cat takes the side of "good" against the winter king to get the upper narrative hand.

      I would disagree in saying that Worm has a very rational protagonist.

      WORM SPOILERS

      Taylor constantly justifies her actions to herself after she does them (threatening hostages to do the bank job to infiltrate the Undersiders to get that information to Armsmaster to build up her rep as a hero, never mind that she's burning her bridges), or lies to herself about her own intentions because she's uncomfortable with intersection (thinking she's infiltrating the Undersiders to arrest them, not to have friends for the first time in years). There was even a 50% chance she would have changed her mind about Dinah to keep her the same way Coil did, even after all that trouble to kill him, because she's useful.

      These aren't the developments of a rational character.

      You could argue that she's rational in that she munchkinned her power a lot. She did do that, I guess.

        >!You are confusing rational thinking and ethical thinking, Taylor is very rational, but her ethics and Morals are all over the place. The whole Dinah thing is the perfect example, Taylor had to actively resist doing the Rational thing, keeping Dinah, over the moral thing, taking her home. Taylor makes plenty of incredibly sketchy moral decisions, but she never makes any entirely irrational ones unless she is specifically bending to her conscience. This works to her advantage in some ways and against her in others, but in the end, the world just doesn't care.!<
        ```

        - u/SOD03:
          ```
          These are immoral things, but I'm arguing that she's being irrational when she lies to herself do as not to make herself uncomfortable, or when she convinces herself her morals are one way but she acts in another.

          Also, she makes plenty of irrational decisions. When she dismisses the Wards as more high school drama without collecting more data, when she disregards Armsmaster's valid points because he's rude, when she compromises her morals not to do the rational thing, but to fit in with her friends, when she puts off giving Coil's relation to the Undersiders to the PRT for no reason, and a lot more. It's not rare, most important decisions are driven by her conscience and emotions.

          I also think it's unreasonable to think that keeping Dinah would be rational. She would look wishy washy if she spent all that time since around Leviathan protesting Dinah's treatment, she would have made killing Coil pointless since he handled things better, aside from Dinah, and she would have known it would weigh down her conscience and decrease her performance. She can't turn off her emotions, so she had to work around them.

    > It's often fun how PTGE recognizes these tropes [...] but at the end of the day if you find these tropes unsatisfying then a fair bit of PTGE is going to be irksome

    Yeah, that's my main problem with the story.

    The way I see it, PGtE emphasizes concepts like "character gets instantaneous powerup at the last minute for a boss fight and then never uses it again" because they're well-known story conventions, but the story never seems to quite realize that they're *bad* story conventions, that people either dislike or tolerate.

    I mean, I guess you can say the story isn't for me, and I should just read something else instead of complaining... but I feel that's a little unfair. The serial is being advertised on r/rational. The story itself constantly makes fun of "heroes" for doing things pretty close to Cat's own behavior, like expecting to automatically win against more experienced enemies because their cause is righteous. The summary says "Her name is Catherine Foundling, and she has a plan", no "Her name is Catherine Foundling, and she's going to win because she deserves to (but she'll keep complaining about how the universe never lets her catch a break)".

    And, really, the potential's there. Book 4 starts with Catherine building an administration, raising an army, accumulating trump cards, planning for future encounters, trying to learn from her past mistakes, and she even sounds like she's reaching some level of self-actualization. It just goes completely out the window once the Battle of the Camps is over.
    ```

    - u/melmonella:
      ```
      Pretty much, yes. It's established quite a few times that planning is necessary and relying on story tropes, wherever hero or villain, will get you killed. Blacks entire strategy consists of minimising story-reliant factors whenever possible and maximising effect of mundane planning, quality and numbers. There was that Prince that got shot in the neck because he thought that challenging a villain to single combat was a good idea. But Catherine apparently doesn't think that planning around her own power is even necessary.

  Ugh.

  &#x200B;

  UGH.

  &#x200B;

  I don't even want to respond to this rant, because you're so tied up in your base assumptions that you can't even see the trees, much less the forest. But here goes:

  &#x200B;

  Cat has told you, over and over and over, that she's not really *that* special. That she has some fancy tricks that put her way over the heads of humans and even most Named, but that she is *absolutely nothing* compared to the top-tier Named. That people like Sve Noc or the Dead King or even the Empress could squash her like a bug if they really wanted to in a straight up fight.  


  She has also told you, over and over and over, that she has one very, very large advantage. To such an extent that it's the primary thing that she relies on, even when winter frankly drove her completely nuts. (I hope she doesn't get it back, she's been much more fun these last chapters). Do you remember what it is? Hint: it's literally the primary motif of the entire story. I suspect you don't remember, going by the above rant about how she's not optimizing her powers to become a clever badass who maximizes her abilities and curb-stomps ancient inhuman deities.

  &#x200B;

  *Cat understands stories and tropes on an intuitive level.* And she understands intuitively how those stories intersect and accentuate her own narrative arc.

  &#x200B;

  That's it. That's all she really has going for her. And in a world that is *clearly*, 200% manipulated and shaped by the gods above and below to be a endless parade of overlapping stories, where the *only* rule or physical law that isn't broken whenever narratively convenient is the law of narrative itself? That's the strongest power there is. So no, she hasn't acted like a crazy automaton who works out the cleverest ways she can use portals and body-shifting to kill things and take power, an unstoppable scourge of death and inhumanity. Because that is an incredibly dumb thing to do, because even though all Earth logic says she'd achieve her aims, what would actually happen is some plucky farmboy (who has an angel on one shoulder and a chip on the other from how her own actions ruined his life) would kill her in some improbable way, because he would be the underdog to her evil queen. So, she's explicitly not the evil queen, never the likely winner- she's the perpetual underdog, always striving, always sacrificing herself and pushing herself to defeat some awful threat even though, yes, some rational forethought should lead her to have better magic skills/weapons and maybe not almost die in literally every fight like it's a narrative trope or something. Because she *is* rational, and knows that being the strongest and most deadly is very much not the way to win in this world.

  The one thing this "review" reminds me of above all else is when Wildbow criticized the rational community as having people who will get outraged that your characters aren't computers dedicated solely to maximizing combat functionality.

  > In every single confrontation she achieves her most important goal perfectly, and only "loses" in ones that are third or lower in her preference ranking.

  Since when? She routinely fails at her objective and settles for a hasty pyrrhic victory through self mutilation.

  > She keeps being granted enormous advantages

  Not really.

  > (Winter mantle, being friends with dead king, having access to thousands of drow), barely uses any of them

  Minter Mantle? Now lost, was never a good thing.

  Friends with the Dead King? This is an absolutely laughable interpretation. The Hidden Horror does not have *friends*. He treated her relatively well when she showed up in his kingdom. That isn't friendship, it is *manners*. Most importantly, she failed to secure an alliance.

  A drow army was what she went to the Everdark to *get*. What would be the point if she used it up in the attempt to claim it? If she recruits half the drow, then sends them into a deathmatch with the other half she accomplishes exactly nothing. Of course she tries to spare the drow.

  > proceeds to not lose her next confrontation anyways.

  She got her ass kiicked *pretty goddamn hard*. Just like at Second Liesse.

  > To make things worse, her character is stuck on the same bloody arc for the past two books (get into fight, get hurt, angst about not being human anymore, reject humanity for the last time pinkie promise, get powerup) with no end in sight.

  Have you even paid attention to the last few chapters? Cat broke that pattern and rejected power at the cost of mortality. She literally outright said

  > “Mortal,” I whispered. “To the end, whatever that may be.”

  That's pretty unambigious.

  > Book started out pretty well too. Catherine was getting to kill some heroes, her being stronger than before was clearly demonstrated, it was implied she was collecting dead heroes for some sort of doomsday plan - perhaps raising them as undead, Dead King style.

  No, she was turning them into single use artifacts. She literally says that the hero's will make good artifacts while deep in alienation. Trying to be Dead King Jr would backfire pretty hard. She is just borrowing an aspect here and there.

  > Cat was using her powers creatively enough, which all culminated with the Battle of the Camps where Cat dropped a lake onto an army. In a move seemingly stronger than what any fey below the level of Kings and Queens have pulled in the last book, it was clearly demonstrated that Cat did, in fact, have a huge reservoir of power to tap into, even if you could guess she wasn't using it to the full capacity (like Ubua).

  After extensive planning and co-ordination with Heirophant, and even then the backlash nearly killed them.

  >First warning bell actually went off a little before the party arrived in Keter, when Catherine was arbitrarily reshaping Ubua's body image. All that it took for her to learn the trick was for someone else to suggest the possibility, and that was that. It already suggested a whole new dimension of possible tactical uses of Winter - could Catherine make her arms longer mid-swing, or just make herself 3 feet taller at all times for extra reach? Could she change the appearance of other fey, and make them look like mortals for infiltration purposes? But that was all relatively minor, up until the point where Catherine up and turned to mist.

  >Wait, wait, hold the fuck up. Mist? She can just do that?

  >Well, okay. Did it at least take something time or resource intensive, like jacking into a bigger well of power, having her soul hacked to improve her finesse with magic, stealing memories of a lifetime of wielding magic from a mage, or something similarily difficult?

  >No, not really. She just, like, tries it. It works immediately, no training or experimentation necessary. In the middle of combat, no less, where she would be maximaly distracted, so it can't take all that much focus and concentration either.

  >And yet she did not have this trick for the crusader fight, where it would have been really useful. Meaning that neither she, nor any of her close friends, so much as suggested she try anything of the sort in the months between Liesse and crusader army arriving. Juniper "First thing I ask when I find out you are half fey is how well your winter powers can help preserve our supply train" Hellhound did not suggest Cat experiment with possibly the strongest weapon their side has to see where it's limits are. Masego did not try to poke at the limitations of her body. Cat herself didn't try increasing her height by sheer accident during one of her angsty rants about how short she is.

  >Cat had ability to arbitrarily reshape her form(she also grows wings later) and function at any time for months, but just was too blindingly stupid to realise it.

  Cat's new situation is literally completely unprecedented. Neither it nor anything like it has ever happened before. It taking some time before she discovers and grows comfortable with her new capabilities is to be expected.

  Cat's ability to change her form required her *abandoning her image of herself*. She literally had a mental block where she had to be tormented into giving up more of her humanity before she could access this power.

  Most importantly, the Keter arc was the Dead King, the great Apotheosis success story, putting Cat through her paces to both discover her capabilities and explore her resourcefulness. It was this books version of a training sequence.

  > Fine, fine. At least she realises this now. Does she learn the general lesson of "Your power is not fully explored, and you desperately need extra functionality because your kingdom is on fire"?

  All the power in the world won't save Callow. Literal gods are trying to have it destroyed, there is no minmaxing your way out of that.

  > Nope. She needs to go to the drow and again start trying things mid combat with agonising slowness to figure anything new out. Instead of jumping from "I can make wings" to "I wonder what are the limits of modifying the topology of my body" she just... stops at wings and regrowing limbs. Can she turn herself into a dust speck, while preserving speed and power (She constantly mentions how those don't rely on muscles), and just shoot herself through the heads of enemies, impossible to hit or hurt? Can she grow 20 tentacles 40 meters long and smash people from far away instead of relying on measly two hands and a sharp piece of iron? If her body is just an avatar for Winter power, can she make a second one, hand it to a minion, and effectively "teleport" across the battlefield by shifting her awareness from one body to another? Hell, can she use multiple bodies at once? Who the hell knows. Certainly not Catherine.

  Huh, it's almost like fundamentally altering your form and identity isn't something to be casually done on a whim but at a measured pace when required by necessity.

  > With how badly she is using her power, it's honestly a wonder she didn't get killed by a passing kitten.

  Can someone pass me an eyeroll emoji?

  > This is all just body manipulation. Now let's talk Gates. Back during Battle of The Camps, Catherine opens one (1) gate above the army, with special help from Masego in order to make it allign with the lake. It is heavily implied this is incredibly difficult to achieve, takes a minute to do and flat out impossible without an assisting mage. Then, in the recent fight this happens:

  >>The first gate opened in front of the Night construct, and it slowed by a fraction as it prepared to leap over it. That was enough. Another two, caging it in a triangle. Another two, above and below. All of them leading to the bottom of the Fields of Wend, that depthless glacier lake at the very heart of Winter.

  > I count five gates, simultaneously, to the same lake, opened in less time than what it would have took for the supernaturally fast panther drow to get out of dodge. With zero power growth in between. This leaves two possibilities:

  > Catherine had the power to do it back then, but it would have dunked her into alienation like a cookie into milk, and trick with Masego was meant to prevent that. Now she can dump alienation onto drow, and thus can pull this off.

  > Catherine, in her sheer blinding stupidity, honestly believed it was supposed to be "hard" to do this, because she still thought she was a mortal and not a damn Queen of Winter. Sadly, this alligns far too well with her character "growth" for me to dismiss this.

  > That's number and speed of Gates. In another chapter she opens a Gate through a stone column, implying Gates can cut things. Would sure have been nice to know this during the battle of the camps, where you could have opened the big gate five meters underground beneath the enemy army, making it much harder to target by enemies, leaving them less time to react, and leaving behind much more mud and water (water under enough pressure to squish drow into mush would have broken through mere five meters of earth easily, leaving behind a five meter deep lake of mud, definitely drowning anyone that was left there).

  Huh, it's almost like Cat got better at something the more she did it. Almost like the pace of her experimentation pays off. No, that can't be right.

  Also, something you seem to miss is that she had Akua as accompanying mage standing in for Masego.

    > What about other things planar travel can do? In yet another chapter, this happens:

    >My Lord of Silent Steps moved with unnatural agility, waiting until the bone trident had struck out before… moving. The description failed to convey what had taken place, though. One moment it’d been standing in the way of the weapon, the next it’d been behind the Mighty and striking with its own glass staff. Afterimages followed a heartbeat later, revealing how it had moved and the whole affair reeked of Winter.

    > It’d skimmed the edge of Arcadia, I realized with a start.

    > Well what do you know, you don't even need proper gates if you try using the power properly.

    Huh, it's almost like Ivah is a veteran with decades of experience shaping mystical power while Cat is a twenty year old scrabbling to play catch up.

    > "But melmonella", I hear you say, "maybe she tried all the various tricks, but couldn't do any of them because she lacks education in magic and couldn't dump alienation onto a small army. With limitations like that, how can you blame her?"

    > Well, a flat metal plate on a door can be pushed, and a handle on a door can be pulled, and limitations usually can be overcome. So let's see if there were any easy, obvious tricks Catherine could have done to overcome one or both of these drawbacks.

    > Oh look, she can tear memories out of people, and uses that to learn Corpuscular from Ubua. She knew about this trick way back then too, as she used it during her assault on the Procer camp with the Wild hunt to sift through the memories of her soldier and locate the officer tent. And she had an incredibly talented disposable mage tied to her collar. Meaning she could have ripped all that knowledge out of Ubua's mind at any time. Ubua mentions that her experience with Diabolism lets her handle winter alienation better than Catherine, so Catherine's usable powerset would have flatly expanded.

    I am honestly in awe that you managed to get this far into *A Practical guide to Evil* and still think that in this setting routinely stealing people's knowledge and relying on it as your own will not ensure your horrific and unpleasant downfall. That is narrative bait of the highest order. Cat was trained not to rely on stolen magical *swords* and you want her to constantly rely on taking stolen magical knowledge into her mind and soul?

    *Have you paid literally no attention*?

    > There is no good reason for Catherine to have remained utterly ignorant of magic for all this time. That ignorance lead to her underutilising her power during the battle of the camps, leading to thousands of her soldiers being utterly slaughtered.

    CXatherine taking the time to study magic before becoming Monarch of Winter would have been criminally irresponsible. Ones magic ability is inborn, it cannot be raised or decreased. One cannot "become" a mage. So, outside of this impossible to predict occurrence that has even the Dead King giddy with surprise there is absolutely no reason for Cat study magic.

    Once she became Monarch of Winter she only had a few months, during which she had endless demands on her time.

    > But what about alienation? Surely she couldn't have figured out a way to deal with that?

    > Well, no, she totally could have. She had a small army of borderline fanatical folowers at her disposal. One call for volunteers to accept titles would have given her hundrends if not thousands of willing title holders, boosting her alienation resistance levels up to what she had after absorbing her first few sigils. Them being volunteers would have also neatly sidestepped any "villain forces people into magic slavery" storylines. Oh, and she'd get a fey analogue to the Watch out of the deal too, again boosting the power of her army by the time Battle of The Camps rolled around, and again preventing thousands of unnecesary casualties. Which would have been a good idea regardless of wherever or not alienation could be dumped on them, but I digress.

    Oh, all Catherine would have to do is sacrifice thousands of Callowan souls.

    Pffft, who cares about silly things like characterisation and the actual story, she *could be more effective in combat!*

    > But surely she didn't know that she could dump alienation onto others before she did it with Ubua by sheer accident?

    > And that is why you experiment with all your new powers, instead of just assuming what they do in advance.

    Yes, this is *definitely* a setting where randomly fucking around with unprecedented magic nobody understands will go well for you. Won't be a problem at allllllll.

    >Granting a title to just several experimental subjects (not to mention a thousand volunteers)

    Would have allowed Above to intervene. It took going to a place consecrated to Below for millenia, where Above has no stake in the fight, for Cat to be willing to grant titles.

    > would have allowed her( if she tore sorcery knowledge out of Ubua's mind, or, alternatively, Masego) to notice the dump of alienation onto other title holders as soon as she tried exerting herself, instead of waiting for Dead King and Ubua to metaphorically beat her on the head with the idea.

    Oh yes, when you have a loyal and loving follower who is an unparalleled asset and whose greatest passion is acquiring knowledge you should definitely start forcefully and torturously ripping knowledge out of their minds.

    Also, Aragorn should have raped all the hobbits. The decrease in stress from sexual gratification would have made him more ready and capable for combat.

    > Practically every personal trick she discovered in this book could have been researched before the Battle of The Camps rolled around.

    Every scientific discovery could have been figured out before it was. But, alas, figuring shit out is a lot harder without hindsight.

    > Given that Catherine was making easy pickings of the heroes on display there, and that she was at least close enough to Saint in the power level to not immediately die, it's not unfeasible that she could have soloed the whole army herself if she was more powerful. You could even say that every single Callowan death in Battle of The Camps has been caused by Catherine deciding that using her powers effectively was for boring people.

    This literally goes against the entire foundation of the story. Trying to solo an army is one of the leading causes of death for Named. Saint couldn't manage it. Amadeus' predecessor was said to be an unstoppable juggernaut with horrific power.....and even he couldn't solo armies.

    This is another point that leaves me honestly shaking my head and wondering if you have actually been paying attention while reading this story.

    > I'd mention exploits you could do with vows, memory manipulation, domains or other things Catherine is apparently natively capable of, but this thing is already getting too long.

    Yeah Cat should have done all these things she didn't know how to do. She should also build a fighter jet. Someone is bound to figure one out eventually, that means Cat should be making use of one *now*.

    > Let's see what we know up to the moment where Cat loses Winter.

    >Catherine is an incompetent buffoon when it comes to magic in general and utilising her own power specifically.

    >Sve Noc has centuries of knowledge and experience at using magic in general and Night specifically

    >Sve Noc is blatantly more powerful than Catheirne in what she can throw around, if only because Catherine is jobbing so much.

    >Sve Noc has such control over magic, that while inside Catherine's domain(where, presumably, Cat would be natively stronger) and losing a magic fight she manages to cut Catherine's soul up to the point where Cat loses all Winter.

    >Now let's see what happens after Catherine becomes mortal again:

    >Catherine gets a mortal body. Somehow. If her previous one was made entirely of Winter, where did this one come from? Was it conveniently stored somewhere, ready to pop out and catch Cat's soul in the event of catastrophic winter failure? Does Winter, if it fails, always reconstruct your mortal body just before exploding?

    >Catherine gets into a "metaphorical" fight inside Sve Noc's soul (where, presumably, Sve Noc would be natively stronger) and wins. Let me repeat, Catherine, with little to no experience at magic, wins in a magic-based fight against an immortal millenia old goddess. After she lost a similar fight inside her own domain. And after losing whatever power she had availible to her. And with no gain of knowledge in the meantime.

    *This was not a magic fight*. It was a *metaphor* fight. A *narrative* struggle. It has more in common with a riddle then a magefight.

    > Let me quote some things from that fight:

    >>Smoke was inhaled by gaping maw, the maw escaped by a scuttling rat, the rat crushed by boot only for mud to stick at the bottom of the sole.

    >How does Cat know that becoming a rat helps against maws? How is she holding her own against a bloody goddess? Where is she suddenly getting all this knowledge for how to wage a fight inside someone else's soul? I dunno, it just works, I guess. Whole fight is Hollywood hacking perosnified as far as our understanding how any of this funcitons, and Cat essentially wins because of plot armor. This is even worse than turning into mist, since here she doesn't even have Winter to guide her actions. Frankly, instead of reading that paragraph, you'd be better off just watching this.

    Yeah, given your repeated failure to notice the most basic thematic and factual rules of the setting as well as basically all characterisation it isn't a surprise you completely failed to understand this.

      > What were Cat's strategic objectives in Battle of The Camps? Get crusaders out of Callow, get Callow a breather for a while, ensure her army doesn't get completely obliterated, survive. What did she achieve? Exactly that. Where did she lose? Well, she lost a bit too many troops, and Pilgrim maybe possibly set a vague redemption story arc that might kill her in a year or more.

      Not quite. Cat's objective was to repel the Crusade in a way that would lead to a lasting peace while maintaining Callow's war capability.

      She repelled the Crusade but was unable to achieve a lasting peace, only a ceasefire, and at the cost of Callow's ability to wage war (which left her defenseless to Malicia's interference).

      She got a third of what she set out for.

      > What were Cat's strategic objectives in coming to Keter? Ensure Procer gets backstabbed so it doesn't even look in Callow's direction for a while, figure out what Dead King wants with her, survive and not lose any Woe. All of them, achieved. Cat even got an unintended powerup out of the deal. Where did she lose? Well, she didn't sign the treaty with DK, and instead Malicia did so, for slightly more brutal terms. Which is arguably another win, since now Malicia and not Cat has a "Let DK out of the box" damocles story sword over her head. And that deal might turn out to be negative to Cat in the long term if Malicia turns DK against Cat. Again, full win in short term, vague possibly negative consequences in long term.

      Again, incorrect. She wanted Procer *occupied* by an incursion from the Dead King, not utterly devastated by an apocalypse set to sweep the world. The Dead King's antics are going to create hero's by the hundred and give Above plenty of excuses to not just put a finger on the scale but to fucking hammer it.

      > Catherine always gets exactly what she wants while putting in the minimum amount of effort. Screams of thousands of innocents dying for no reason can be heard in the background. I have no doubt that she would get Sve noc on her side with liberal application of Friendship No Jutsu too, and would continue to angst about sacrificing oh so very much while actually doing oh so very little.

      You have repeatedly failed to understand both Catherine's goals and motivations.

      > But enough about her objectives. Let's talk about her character.

      At the beginning I would have been delighted to get to this. Now I am extremely apprehensive.

      > Who is Catherine Foundling, really? Well, let's see what her positive and negative qualities are. In Book 1, she was a brutish pit fighter with a snarky streak, who was inexperienced at all the various magical and esoteric stuff, and was willing to make tough choices if that got her what she wanted, which was safety and independance for Callow.

      You completely fail to mention her greatest assets, literally the things that define her as a character, in order to focus on surface level observations.

      > Now we are three books later, so she is a budding professional at dealing with magic, and has accquired a wealth of combat experience, thus ra -

      >Wait, sorry, give me a second, I have a call on another line. Yes, melmonella speaking. What is it? She is what? What do you mean no desire to learn? Oh my. Alright, thank you for your call.

      >Well what do you know. Catherine still has not the foggiest idea about what magic is. Indeed, she jokes about her lack of knowledge in various fields constantly, which would be endearng if it wasn't so bloody aggravating because it shows her total inability to prioritise her learning (and thus, her personal power, and thus, the safety of her kingdom) over short-term fun. How many people intensely dislike, say, Philosophy, yet manage to keep attention in university class enough to pass the required course? Well, all those people have a better attention span than Catherine, who could not keep herself awake through various characters (as far as I remember, at least Killian and Masego attempted, and possibly Archer) giving her lectures on magic, which could literally be a difference between life and death in her line of work.

      >Best as I can tell, only skill of Catherines that grew throughout the books was her ability to kill things with a piece of metal, which brings her to the level of ability of an average rifle. Not rifleman, rifle.

      Cat has had a few years to work against plans decades in the making put in place by the continents greatest minds. Oh no wait, one of the masterminds she is working against can't be dated because she *predates record keeping*.

      Cat outright states at one point that she is working against someone so entrenched that they could have arranged for her grandparents to die before her parents were born if she thought Catherine would one day be a threat.

      She is working on an impossible schedule and doesn't have *time* to master every esoteric subject which may be relevant. What she *can* do is win over experts in various fields and use them as advisors. And that is exactly what she fucking did.

      Cat cannot learn to become a mage. And so magic will always be an academic subject for her. And so Masego and Killian are enough.

      > Best as I can tell, only skill of Catherines that grew throughout the books was her ability to kill things with a piece of metal, which brings her to the level of ability of an average rifle. Not rifleman, rifle.

      So long as you ignore her ability to manipulate the most important fundamental power in her universe, her ability win people to her cause, her ability to plan ahead. So yeah if you put a lot of work into ignoring her improvements she hasn't made much of an improvement.

      > And let's mention her continuing arc of rejecting her humanity for power. (I bloody well hope it's completed now that she is mortal again, though with how conservative Catherine tends to be I can just see her picking up another source of immortality and starting on the same arc again.) To my counting, it happened at least four times by now. First somewhere around Liesse, where Catherine ripped at her soul to murder Ubua. Second, during the Battle of The Camps, if memory serves, when she got back from her magic coma. Third, in Keter, when she learned to turn to Mist and such. And several more times in the Underdark. Every single time she goes through the same motions - she needs more magical power, so she rejects her humanity 

      It's......it's almost like important themes repeat themselves in a story. Wow, that couldn't possibly be. It's almost like Cat making this her worst habit was setting it up for the ultimate subversion recently where she rejected that practice wholesale and clung to her mortality whatever the cost.

      > (with much angsting about how good it must be to be mortal and full of lice, and ignoring that she has a bloody country to look after), which allows her to go over one conceptual block or another and allows her to use her powers more efficiently. And each time Catherine treats it like this grand revelation even if it already happened before. Girl, get it over with already.

      Yes, the leader of a nation having their decisionmaking process compromised aint no thang but a chicken wang.

      > Of course, what would Catherine be without a dash of hypocrisy. Let's take the most recent chapter:

      >>I forgive her for it. And Akua, well, she was raised in a bucket even more vicious than this one. She’s still learning to let go of those blinders. You, though? I’m disappointed that at no point you figured out you could simply ask.

      >>How much could we have avoided if instead of clawing at each other we’d sat down and talked?

      >Kettles who live in glass houses should not throw bricks at pots for being black, Catherine. Remind me, for how long did you discuss your goals with Malicia once you became queen of Callow? Did you, mayhaps, attempt to settle on a good old-fashioned compromise? Callow gets independence, Praes gets food, with terms enforced by oaths? Or did you decide that virtue signaling about how terrible Malicia was for funding Liesse was more important than lives of your own subjects?

      >Those assassinations Malicia performed? Yeah, your fault. Should have visited a marriage councelor before that relationship broke down that far.

      >In Keter, did you talk to Malicia, and arrange a deal where you agree to not fight so that Dead King can't bring down your prices by playing one of you against another? You literally had the same general goal of "get Dead King to attack procer", it's hard to pick an easier spot for compromise. Or did you jump straight to assassination as first responce policy?

      >"But that was my mantle, it totally controlled my thoughts and made me uncreative and stuff!"

      For fucks sake, Cat was so struck by the hypocrisy of not having lived up to what she was asking that she immediately fucking killed herself afterwards.

      And you don't even use the right fucking examples. Cat already provided them!

      In point of fact, Cat *did* negotiate with Malicia regularly. Malicia betrayed her because she is fundamentally incapable of trusting anyone.

      >"But that was my mantle, it totally controlled my thoughts and made me uncreative and stuff!"

      > No, sorry, Catherine. Stupid was in you all along. Komena said it best:

      >You could, at least, attempt a believable lie. ‘Nike, she’s not even held her half of the Garden for a decade. The drift would be negligible. It was still her. The only difference was that she had power enough to cow her foes.

      > I do wonder what would be the stupidest thing Catherine does in this book. Currently she is up to tens of thousands of innocent deaths. At least Diabolist was going somewhere with her own genocide, instead of making it happen due to sheer bloody obliviousness.

      Yes, I am sure Komena is a perfectly rational and unbiased perspective.

      You have fundamentally failed to understand not only the character you are continually insulting but even the world she inhabits.

    And i agree with wildbow, atleast partially. This community tends to fixate on those things a lot. One of the more annoying things you can see are the many fix fics where some SI with meta knowledge gets thrown in as one of the main characters and solves everything going counter to the famous advice of "if you give frodo a lightsaber then you need to give sauron the deathstar". That doesnt mean that your interpretation as many others in the thread was extremaly uncharitable to OP. The underlaying themes of the guide arent complicated and you ridicule his arguments without giving them a fair trial.

    All in all even if you call Caths wins as pyrric victotories she had a pretty good run as far as it goes. Even if she mutilated her own soul in the process her achievments cannot be waved away. Maybe it was scraping by but still. She had advantages from the start tho. Being the squire to black and having the help of malicia and calamities behind her. The training they gave her and the influence she got because of it. Especially so compared to your usual dime  z dozen heroes she defeated prior to this arc. Getting an apotheosis even which is kinda ridiciolous in power. You can shout that it was never any good all you want but it was pretty damn useful anyways. Creation is not arcadia and still has an element of physicality to it meaning that crops still grow at the normal speed and the narrative wont save the callowans from emptying their reserves. The same goes for armies. Didnt one of the princes get shot in the head because he was stupid ?

    She did finally break the patern by giving away winter, all of it. Why do you think its a pattern in the first place. As OP said she had been on the same character point atleast 4 times which was pretty damn repetitive in the long run and rather annoying. Rejecting her humanity/recognizing that she no longer is human atleast 4 times. I can get excited only so many times for the same character arc all the time. It shouldnt have been repeated at all. By repeating it it cheapens the previous instances of it. We got it, she isnt human and has problems with that, what else??? In the end she rejected winter alltogether and thats why the pattern was broken and not because she gained real character growth.

    Cats situation isnt unprecedented, we just learned that there are other guys in the immortals club and sure, maybe she didnt know that at the time. Sure, its expected to take some times but although she governed a kingdom in decline she had made plans for heroes and had a bit of time to think over her new powers. It is a rather glaring flaw considering that thinking of the powers winter is capable of is rather simple. And sure, she had to abandon the image of herself with the mental block and all of that but whats after that. SHe had to do it 4 times. How many mental blocks are we talking about here. we are repeating that character arc with the mental block constantly and its tedious while reading this. The Dead King thingy was a test but it was just another desperate situation, it didnt have anything really that unique to it besides cath needing a sudden power up. The OP straight up adresses this thing. Cat just doesnt learn and its frustrating when reading the story. Its not a diffifuclt realization to have that winter maybe could be capable of more things than just healing your body and growing wings. SHe could ask other mages etc. And sure, maybe no amount of power will save callow and pilgrim is against her but there are more subtle ways of winning that fight, she could learn from the dead king and do something with all the heroes she has been hunting ? idk

    Why cant she alter her form tho. After the whole "wow winter is capable of so much more than i thought thingy" and turning into mist and whatever its not hard to go, wait what if? Its not a great leap to make after learning that she isnt human.

    Cat is learning but its at such a slow and agonizing pace that its pretty meaningles. She has enormous innate capabilities in vows and domain things yet somehow its too hard or she didnt have the realization to do the things.

    In general although i do not agree with everything OP has said you make it as if the story has no flaws at all, going on a damn crusade against OP over disagreement about the story. The snarky tone also doesnt help. It reeks of fanboism.

      > That doesnt mean that your interpretation as many others in the thread was extremaly uncharitable to OP

      OP is the one who set the tone. He labelled the protagonist stupid in literally his second sentence and only got harsher from there, all the while demonstrating that he was often simply not paying attention.

      Frankly there is a *reason* so many people here have been "uncharitable" to OP. And it's not like this is even the Guide's sub.

      >The underlaying themes of the guide arent complicated and you ridicule his arguments without giving them a fair trial.

      I ridicule his arguments because they are ridiculous. He repeatedly fails to understand the basic rules of the setting.

      > All in all even if you call Caths wins as pyrric victotories she had a pretty good run as far as it goes. Even if she mutilated her own soul in the process her achievments cannot be waved away. Maybe it was scraping by but still.

      Agreed.

      > She had advantages from the start tho. Being the squire to black and having the help of malicia and calamities behind her. The training they gave her and the influence she got because of it. Especially so compared to your usual dime z dozen heroes she defeated prior to this arc.

      Oh absolutely, she had people in her own corner from the start, but that mentorship had a price and no shortage of strings attached. Like how Malicia leaned on Black to lean on Catherine to go easy on Akua.

      It was also something she was forced to earn in blood. Even with Black's pick she had to kill off the other claimants to get the Name.

      >Getting an apotheosis even which is kinda ridiciolous in power. You can shout that it was never any good all you want but it was pretty damn useful anyways. Creation is not arcadia and still has an element of physicality to it meaning that crops still grow at the normal speed and the narrative wont save the callowans from emptying their reserves. The same goes for armies. Didnt one of the princes get shot in the head because he was stupid?

      Apotheosis is fundamentally incompatible with Catherine's approach as taught by Black. The reason behind Black and Malicia's success is that in defiance of thousands of years of Praesi tradition they relegate power as being a means to an end rather than an end in and of itself. Winter changed the way Cat thought and acted, which inherently compromises her goals. Power she cannot use to accomplish her goals is worse then nothing. Just like that prince who pranced around as if power was all that mattered and got a crossbow bolt in the throat. If the power makes you too stupid to do anything with it, it was never worth having.

      Yes, the power the mantle offered was instrumental in fighting off the Crusade. But it was also the main reason the Crusade wouldn't back down when she tried to negotiate.

      In *A Practical Guide to Evil* power itself is a trap, so being handed a great big blob of it is no blessing. 

      It's really telling that upon having the power of a god torn away from her Cat's reactions is *"Oh god, finally!"* 

      > She did finally break the patern by giving away winter, all of it. Why do you think its a pattern in the first place. 

      Because it is one of the most frequently used storytelling techniques. If you listen to the podcast discussing Wildbow's works, they refer to it regularly. Good old three beat.

      It's even directly referenced in universe withinin the context of Named interpersonal conflicts (the rule/pattern of 3).

      > As OP said she had been on the same character point atleast 4 times which was pretty damn repetitive in the long run and rather annoying. Rejecting her humanity/recognizing that she no longer is human atleast 4 times. I can get excited only so many times for the same character arc all the time. It shouldnt have been repeated at all. By repeating it it cheapens the previous instances of it. We got it, she isnt human and has problems with that, what else??? In the end she rejected winter alltogether and thats why the pattern was broken and not because she gained real character growth.

      Op conflated several points. It is actually three occurrences, the final one of which was just subverted (after being stretched rather far).

      > Cats situation isnt unprecedented, we just learned that there are other guys in the immortals club and sure, maybe she didnt know that at the time.

      No, Cat's situation is 100% completely unprecedented. Immortality has been claimed.

      But never before has a mortal become fae.

      Never before has a fae court been reduced to one individual.

      Never before has there been a fae ruler in Creation.

      When Cat became Sovereign of Moonless Nights she became the intersection of at least three completely unprecedented magical phenomena *as well as* achieving apotheosis.

      >Sure, its expected to take some times but although she governed a kingdom in decline she had made plans for heroes and had a bit of time to think over her new powers. It is a rather glaring flaw considering that thinking of the powers winter is capable of is rather simple. 

      It *seems* simple, in retrospect, once she has figured some things out. But things always do with hindsight. Gravity existed for the entirety of human civilisation. How long did it take for us to develop a true understanding of it?

      > And sure, she had to abandon the image of herself with the mental block and all of that but whats after that. SHe had to do it 4 times. How many mental blocks are we talking about here. we are repeating that character arc with the mental block constantly and its tedious while reading this.

      No, she didn't. The earlier times she contemplated her humanity were unrelated to Winter.

      Once she abandoned her view of her body she didn't need to do so again, she just needed time to mull it over and reasons to experiment and she did more with her body.

      >  The Dead King thingy was a test but it was just another desperate situation, it didnt have anything really that unique to it besides cath needing a sudden power up.

      It was a desperate situation deliberately designed by someone with a greater understanding of the apotheosis transition then anyone else in the world. It took the Dead King more then a decade to plan his apotheosis and millenia since to fully leverage it. Cat has had less then a year after having had no preparation.

      > The OP straight up adresses this thing. Cat just doesnt learn and its frustrating when reading the story.

      No, she very clearly *does* learn or people wouldn't be able to point to the things she learns and ask why she wasn't doing that from the start.

      What people take issue with is that they feel Cat is learning too slowly, which I disagree with.

      > Its not a diffifuclt realization to have that winter maybe could be capable of more things than just healing your body and growing wings. SHe could ask other mages etc.

      She *did* realize that and she *did* ask other mages. What do you think Absolute Positioning was? Cat and Masego spent months plotting out how to use her new nature offensively in battle and when the situation called on it they applied it to kill more then ten thousand enemy soldiers in five minutes.

      But people *completely ignore that* and insist Cat should also have spent all her time figuring out her other powers despite the demands on her time.

      > And sure, maybe no amount of power will save callow and pilgrim is against her but there are more subtle ways of winning that fight, she could learn from the dead king and do something with all the heroes she has been hunting ? idk

      *She has*. When she kills a hero she turns their corpse into a single use artefact. She wasn't using them because she wanted to keep her trump cards and avoid escalation.

      > Why cant she alter her form tho. After the whole "wow winter is capable of so much more than i thought thingy" and turning into mist and whatever its not hard to go, wait what if? Its not a great leap to make after learning that she isnt human.

      She began altering her form pretty regularly. It's hardly a surprise that becoming an entirely new kind of creature that has never existed before requires an adjustment period.

      Babies are so damn lazy, look at how long it takes them to learn to walk. Don't they know they had legs the whole time?

      > Cat is learning but its at such a slow and agonizing pace that its pretty meaningles. She has enormous innate capabilities in vows and domain things yet somehow its too hard or she didnt have the realization to do the things.

      There are *enormous* drawbacks to using vow and domains, which the story doesn't hesitate to point out.

      Notice how using her domain *lost Cat the fight*?

      > In general although i do not agree with everything OP has said you make it as if the story has no flaws at all

      That wasn't the intention in the slightest. Book 4 has been very uneven and is in need of a critical eye.

      > going on a damn crusade against OP over disagreement about the story.

      Just because criticism is needed, doesn't mean all criticism is automatically right. If my *response* to OP (where I simply quote them and reply with a usually shorter counterpoint) is a crusade, then what is his post? A megacrusade?

      It isn't that the story has no flaws. It's that OP couldn't find them with both hands and an aspect designed for it. Making complaints isn't enough, people need to find the *right* complaints or it is just shit flinging.

      "This ice cream doesn't taste like a ham sandwich" is not a valid complaint. And neither is what OP rants about.

      Looks look at his hypocrisy rant again:

      He complains about Cat coming off as hypocritical when literally seconds after his quote ends she is so struck by her own hypocrisy that she literally fucking kills herself. She even lists out all the examples of her hypocrisy. Then OP completely ignores all of these perfectly made examples and lists a bunch of stuff that is just wrong.

      > The snarky tone also doesnt help.

    What makes PGtE different from typical fantasy novels? The world built on the tropes, the characters made aware of the tropes, weaponizing the tropes.

  I think EE's recent chapters have been angling for a **"Winter inhibited rationality"** argument, what with how Cat basically amended her victory conditions to "No Winter Immortality" after losing it and her quips about Winter insulating her from Creation or being drunk on the ability to walk off lost limbs. That tact basically writes off EE's need to justify anything post-Winter as rational. Which was this entire book.

  Hell, maybe Winter made Cat go to the Drow in the first place, because story reasons. So I won't even fault her for that incredibly poor decision, or the fact that Cat didn't pull out of the Battle of Great Strycht with her perfectly sufficient army of demigods when it became clear she was heading for a pivot and potential complete loss over a *BATTLE THAT DOES NOT EVEN MATTER*. Loot & leave would have been perfectly sufficient, but let's chalk that decision making process up to Winter logic.

  What **really** bothers me, is Cat angling for an alliance with Sve Noc AFTER she's divested of Winter and presumably back in her right mind. I mean for fuck's sake, joining the Drow in Jolly Cooperation™ to solve her 1) Crusade, 2) Dead King, 3) Praes problems is a fantasy *when the first issue the alliance would have to address would be the Dwarves*. The Dwarves who would have the earth swallow Callow out of spite if she crossed them, the Dwarves she entered into a contract with to kill Sve Noc, the Dwarves who she needs to save Callow's budget crisis, the Dwarves who plan to exterminate any Drow remaining underground. All while her allies would be a goddess of unknown ability, competency, or sanity, and the isolated but murderous herds of cats that make up what's left of Drow society.

  But I guess those are 'later' problems, because Cat has bigger issues to worry about--like not dying.

  It's hard to write a rational character's loss.
  ```

  - u/JustLookingToHelp:
    ```
    What the dwarves want is to take over the Drow's territory, and for Sve Noc to go away.  If Cat takes Sve Noc and all the drow to the surface, solves their "we have to be murderous assholes or we all die immediately" problem, and leaves the Dwarves the hell alone, I don't think they'd have a problem with her.
    ```

    - u/Gr_Cheese:
      ```
      And that's totally the way I expect this to go, but my problem with that plot's direction is that it flies completely counter to the picture that we have of Drow society. Drow don't have a government, they don't have trust, and they solve their problems with violence. That does not equal mass exodus, that does not even equal retreat.

      If there's an easy answer, if Winterized Sve Noc can just power through those fundamental problems with Drow society, and spirit them away to Arcadia to live in relative peace, then my response is: Why isn't that level of power sufficient to deal with the Dwarves directly?

  Long form of my grievances with the story:

  The entire point of Black's philosophy is that the way to win as a villain is avoid stories to minimise their narrative impact and just rely on pragmatism and rationality instead of stories. This method WORKING is proven time and time again early on in the story, for example with Cat shooting that one hero with a crossbow bolt in the throat in book 2.

  Moreover, early on, the story says multiple times that being a Villain and trying to lean into Hero tropes is signing your own death warrant as the Gods Below won't stand for it. For example, during the battle of Marchford, Cat tries to act like a Hero, ignoring Masego's warnings that that is a bad idea, and ends up horrifically mangling her soul by letting a demon inside it.

  And both of those things just end up being thrown aside later on, seemingly simply forgotten by the author. Catherine doesn't act rationally, she constantly leans into Hero stories, and then despite being a Villain she still constantly ends up being rewarded by the universe and wins, which makes no sense.

  That is just extremely aggravating and shows the author has a complete disregard for internal consistency in the work.
  ```

  - u/AntiChri5:

    Black's method is *not enough*. It is a way to prevent defeat, not a way to achieve victory and as we see with the loss of Captain and capture of Black, now that the true powers of the continent have taken notice of him it has stopped working entirely.

    Turning herself into a lesser version of Black would accomplish nothing, even he didn't want that.

    You are also dramatically oversimplifying Cat's narrative manipulations while failing to mention the many times it has been invaluable for her.

      Black held Callow for 20 years, slowly integrating it into Praes. The book points out that Callowans were slowly becoming more and more used to being part of Praes, with it being a matter of time until it became part of Callow's story.

      If that's not victory, I don't know what is.

        Black felt so strongly that he could never integrate Callow into Praes that he created Catherine. His entire goal was stasis. Stall until he could shape a Callowan into someone who would bring Callow into the fold fully. And even then that stasis was only possible because the oppositions real champions, The Saint of Swords, the Grey Pilgrim and The Wandering Bard, were all occupied elsewhere. Now that they have turned their attention to the Calamities what has happened? The Calamaties have started dying off. First Captain, then Warlock. With him captured and ranger having fucked off that leaves only one Calamity active on the board.

        Black had a unique approach which served him well, but there is a *reason* he has been pondering how to live in the world Catherine is going to create, and not the other way around. Black can dodge stories. Cat can co-opt them.

          He created a Squire because he knew noone lives forever and he couldn't be truly immortal, not because he thought that was the only way to integrate Callow.

          After all, Callow did slowly integrate into Praes, and that was the only reason someone like Catherine (who draws culturally on both Callow and Praes) became possible in the first place.

          Further integration was just a matter of time.

            He turned over control of the country to her before she was twenty years old. That isn't "I must someday have a successor". That is "Only she can really do this".

            Black could get Callow to play along. To not rebel. To keep the food shipments coming and not make trouble. But he had to do so by actively stamping out Callowan culture. The same culture which let them hold the line for so long against Praes. If extended a few more decades, Callow would not have successfully rebelled or rejected him in any effective capacity.

            It simply would have died.

            It would have ceased to be Callow, becoming just an imperial province.

            But Cat can get more then Callow playing along until it bleeds to death. Cat can get Callowan knights riding down the enemies of the empire, priests of the house of light healing legionaries. Cat can make Callow a unique valued partner, not just a broken resource mine.

            Callow under Black meant no peasants pulling swords out of stones. Callow under Cat means the peasants pulling swords out of stones are *on Blacks side*.

  [You](https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2018/05/02/court-i/) [missed](https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2018/06/01/court-ii/) [these](https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2018/07/02/court-iii/) it seems.

  Also, time is a thing you know. At the end of Book 3, she was a newly crowned Queen of a country which just had its second biggest city turned into Walking Dead. Economic and military problems exist, refugees need to be rehabilitated, decisions need to be made, dependance on Malicia should be reduced before ultimately being stamped out, a war machine must be started, heroic incursions must be stopped, armies must be recruited, trained, and fitted for - oh it's the start of Book 4 already.

  > She had a small army of borderline fanatical folowers at her disposal. One call for volunteers to accept titles would have given her hundrends if not thousands of willing title holders, boosting her alienation resistance levels up to what she had after absorbing her first few sigils.

  Making her just a "monster on the Callowan throne" that must be eliminated at all cost, destroying pretty much ANY chance of negotiation (which are growing slim already, even with the little Winter she's used), ensuring that two of the *OLDEST HEROES ON THE CONTINENT* have a narrative advantage by fighting with a monster and not having the whole "invading a sovereign nation" devil on their back.

  Bonus: Might allow Winter to spread roots in creation, specifically Callow, turning it into a wasteland, thus fucking up her own country AND Praes. And if you had paid just a little bit of attention to the story, Cat knows this and has mentioned it multiple times in-story.

  Best example.

  *“Ah, but do you rule it as Sovereign of Moonless Nights?” she said. “Hardly. Even the Wild Hunt are merely in your service, not true vassals. You bound neither the Woe nor the realm to your mantle.”*

  *“Making Arcadia but worse out of my home isn’t exactly in the works, yes,” I flatly replied.*

  *“And so you have not grown roots,” Diabolist said. “An apotheosis incomplete, so to speak. Did you not wonder why the Grey Pilgrim and his ilk are so desperate to remove you from the throne?”*

  *“I’m a villain ruling Callow,” I said. “I don’t believe we need to revisit the whole Calernian balance of power argument, Gods know I’m tired of hearing about it.”*

  *“The Carrion Lord ruled it for decades,” Akua said. “And, to be frank, the legitimacy of your rule is only marginally better.”*

  *“Roots,” I said. “That’s what you’re implying. The Peregrine worries about me growing roots in Callow.”*

  *“It is one thing to slay a villainous queen of Callow,” Diabolist said. “Quite another to seek the destruction of the immortal Black Queen, the wintry personification of centuries of her people’s grudges. The first is a threat. The second is another Dead King, one whose armies can march through the realm of the fae.”*

  *“He knows,” I said, then hesitated. “Or at least suspects that I intend to abdicate.”*

  *“And so you were handled with gloves,” Akua said. “Deals and stories, marching armies instead of a Choir unleashed. You ascribe this to the man being reasonable, but he is a hero. If that decision was made, it was made because he feared that cornering you would see you tumbling through the threshold of apotheosis complete.”* - [B4C72](https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2018/11/16/chapter-72-outflow/)

  > Catherine. Remind me, for how long did you discuss your goals with Malicia once you became queen of Callow? Did you, mayhaps, attempt to settle on a good old-fashioned compromise? Callow gets independence, Praes gets food, with terms enforced by oaths? Or did you decide that virtue signaling about how terrible Malicia was for funding Liesse was more important than lives of your own subjects?

  *"I had my plan. It’d taken me months and more people brought in to put it together than I was truly comfortable with, but I had the the skeleton of the Liesse Accords on parchment. Malicia, I knew, never would agree. That meant Malicia had to go, sooner or later."* - [B4C5](https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2018/04/23/chapter-5-interests/)

  Also this -

  *"Asked," I repeated in a murmur.*

  *Hypocrite to end, was I? Demanding what I would not offer. Was compromise on my own terms even compromise at all, or just victory by another name? For all I’d said tonight, one thing had not changed: I had not learned to lose.*

  *"Hear me, Sve Noc," I said. "Whatever claim I yet hold to Winter, I pass to you. My crown of Moonless Night, I lay at your feet. I stand before you without power or right to my name, mortal at your mercy."*

  *'Help me,' I asked, begged, prayed. 'Please.'"* - [B4C81](https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2018/12/07/chapter-81-only-to-the-just/)

  How do you not get this?

  The entire point of this dumpster fire seems to be that you want to read a completely different story instead of this one, one where the protagonist is a rational munchkin of any and all powers that (s)he gets, and isn't really constrained by shackles like narrative or morality.

  Maybe... read a different story? There are plenty of power fantasies out there that focus on munchkining. You would probably enjoy those a lot more instead of wasting your time hoping every story you read fits one archetype.

  I second this in that, what drew me to the story initially, was Black's belief in the power of institutions and subversion of story logic.   

  Cat in the last arc has been leaning ever harder on being a powerful fighter, faerie queen, evil lady.  It's very lone hero/named character.      


  The story of how Black turned Praes into professional clockwork brutality is a more interesting story than Cat's current arc.
  ```

  - u/CouteauBleu:
    ```
    The story does suffer from Eragon syndrome a bit, where the side-characters are more interesting, nuanced and multi-dimensional than the main character. I often find myself thinking, "Man, this would be so much better if Cat was more like Black in every conceivable way!"
    ```

- u/signspace13:
  ```
  You are viewing the story from such a narrow perspective as to miss the whole point.

  From my perspective PGTE is a story about exploring the significance of stories, by making stories the *most significant* thing in existence, Cat is the lense that we view this world through for the most part, and she is a fucking fantastic one because she *understands*. Cat understands the meta level at which her world operates, and gives us the perfect viewpoint from which to watch this world unfold, she gives us a biased view of it, but that is also the point, as it gives us baseline assumptions and expectations that can be subverted later on. 

  PGTE could be renamed 'A practical guide to Stories' and still have a completely accurate title, this is a story about a character that has to breakdown stories to understand them and then build them up in her own way in order to win, thus teaching us of the components of the story we are reading and still surprising us with the direction that Cat takes because she (and of course EE) understands the story much better than we do. 

  PGTE is so much more than the story of a 16 year-old girl trying to save her country, it is a story about stories, of hero's and villains and how they interact, of protagonists and antagonists and their place in the narrative and the world, of morality and it's ability to be bent to fit a story and how in a world and society so vastly different from our own, we should not expect morality to be viewed and judged in the same way as we do.

  PGTE is one of those stories that I consider near perfect, and calling it bad because the MC isn't Munchkining her powers into oblivion is missing the point entirely.
  ```

  - u/AugSphere:
    ```
    And did Catherine come by her aptitude with stories honestly? Does she work on it ahead of time, does she practice, does she plan to set up advantageous narratives? No, she tries to win by mundane means first, by training a professional army, by setting up Masego with that scrying McGuffin and so on. Let's not pretend mundane (and magical) power means nothing in that world. Oh, there is a pretence she is paying attention to it, with archer remarking on how she constantly thinks in narrative terms and Catherine ruminating on narrative of her invasion from time to time, but it's ultimately inconsequential to her strategy. It's just that whatever she's at the end of her rope and her mundane abilities aren't enough due to her being shit at exploiting them, she *happens* to know what the right thing to do and say to exploit the narrative is by natural talent.

    It's set in an interesting enough universe, don't get me wrong, but Catherine is just a bumbling fool who happens to win by luck and author fiat vast majority of the time, which doesn't do my enjoyment any favours. Not to mention that her character arc amounts to endless whingeing about how she's not good/human enough any more with almost no actual development of character (yes, I remember that there is an excuse of winter-did-it for it, doesn't make the lack of development magically interesting).
    ```

      > with archer remarking on how she constantly thinks in narrative terms

      Yeah, that line felt a little dishonest to me.

      We've definitely seen other characters think in story terms before.
      ```

      - u/PotentiallySarcastic:
        ```
        Archer's point was that she was always doing that. Her and Black are their own variety of crazy even in universe. They never relax and always are running narratives in their head from a 3rd person perspective.

        It's brilliant, but it is also exhausting and pretty alienating. Other Named relax more.
        ```

    - u/signspace13:
      ```
      She *absolutely* thinks and plans ahead using narrative terms, the entire conflict with the faeries was won entirely through her planning how she was going to turn the story against them, she hasn't been as good at it of late as she has had a rather dominant and corrupting entity influencing her thoughts, but she is still very good at it, in both short and long term situations, she doesn't win everytime and she isn't infallible, if she did and was then the story would be boring.

      Catherine's character has indeed progressed significantly throughout the narrative (someday I need to do a write up on my differentiation of character development and character progression), her learning her aptitude for stories is one of those serious progressions, she is certainly more proud as the series goes on and she isn't nearly as naive as she was in the begging, and that isn't even considering the most recent chapters, which have shown in *immense* character growth on her part, now that she isn't held quite so stagnant by the mantle of winter.

      The idea that Catherine is 'Whiney' is honestly odd to me, how often does she actually *whine*, not often, she is certainly an introspective character with a heavy conscience that dislikes some of the choices she has had to make, it's almost as if deep down she doesn't agree with a lot of those choices and she is having a harder time justfying them to herself, thus making her more introspective over time. Go read Savage Divinity if you want to see whiney, that Main character has the *woe is me* track playing in his head every chapter.
      ```

  - u/exceptioncause:
    ```
    Nope, in most situations the author has not showed us how Cat understands the stories, at best she comes to the understanding closer to culmination points, probably to take readers by surprise. But Black does, and it looks really impressive. I do love to see more characters openly showing their understanding on the matter, more story politics and manipulation. Unfortunately, it mostly reserved for rare moments...
    ```

- u/werafdsaew:
  ```
  I agree that she should have been exploring the limits of her power with Masego.  But in her defense ruling over Callow is a full time job.
  ```

  - u/melmonella:
    ```
    She has most of the rulership outsourced to competent people, like Hakram, Vivienne, Kendall, Juniper and etc already. All she actually does is make broad decisions about the direction of the country, which does not take 16 hours a day. She can perfectly well sit in a large hall experimenting with her powers and wait for people who need her input to come to her. Didn't she also stop sleeping? That's an extra 8 hours a day right there. Given that at the higher levels of her power it's ridiculously strong, and how little invested time is necessary to get those returns, you can argue that her prioritising (say) gathering an army over experimentation is a foolish choice.

  I try to hold back from criticizing PGTE when I can, because it's clear a lot of people on r/rational enjoy it. But when a criticism thread comes along, I consider it enough of an excuse to point out that in my opinion, it's not only not particularly rational, it's not that good. As it's progressed, its flaws have only grown while its strengths wither. I don't even care to debate over whether Cat's actions/character/narrative arcs make sense anymore because I flat-out don't care about them. The story is boring. I've been bored since book 2. The demon fights were boring. Battling fairies was boring. Akua's rebellion was boring. The crusade was almost not boring, but got boring. Keter was nonsensical and boring. The underdark is somehow the most boring arc yet.

  Chapter after chapter after chapter of slogging through dozens of samey, meaningless action sequences glued together with chapters that can sometimes be ONE SINGLE CONVERSATION in which the same point is reiterated over and over, the same growth points rehashed. 

  And the banter - I know I've used the word "boring" a lot this post, so I'll just say it feels like a crutch EE leans on far too heavily, to the point where it feels awfully -- not gonna say it -- *repetitive*, to the point where by trying to differentiate characters through their different banters, he ends up flanderizing them because the percentage of their dialogue/thoughts that _is_ banter is turned up far too high.

  Of course, the plot is a mess, the characters inconsistent, and the world fundamentally broken, to the point that the entire story is basically running on Rule of Cool. Which is great, until the cool parts stop being cool and start being tedious.
  ```

  - u/Xtraordinaire:
    ```
    Boring (I said it!) banter was the final reason I dropped the story mid book 2, so I think you have a point. Cat's companions were hard to differentiate. There were other more fundamental reasons, but this was the most obvoius one.

    So I think you have a good point.
    ```

  - u/Banarok:
    ```
    well... why do you keep up with it if you've found it boring since book 2?, I'll understand reading on a little bit and hoping it change but for that long you're either overly stubborn or way too optimistic.

    I can agree with that some things are a bit samey, but personally i don't mind too much i expect competent writing not masterful one, and the aqua spiel is a bit old with "shes good, but i cant trust her" it's true but should be omitted at this point.

    your complaint is in general good, it's mainly about opinion and everyone have a right to one of those, so feel free to think that it's boring, everyone's taste differ and that is great!

    the OP however state many things as facts rather then opinions, and many of those things makes me wonder if he've even read the novel or just glanced at it just reading the fights since he don't seem to understand the universe at all since many of his complaints are addressed in universe, like why she don't absorb all the night, "oh free experiences from other people will totally come with no mental repercussions at all......" not to mention it feels very much like a trap, akin to drugs.

    so if you're gonna write a a4 of rants about why you hate something you better make sure it's correct and twist and turn it so your arguments for it holds water now his post grate my nerves.
    ```

    - u/royishere:
      ```
      I have a strong predisposition towards finishing things I start, to the point where even being aware of it does little to dissuade me. I suppose "overly stubborn" applies here. 

      And absolutely right -- people are free to enjoy it! I stay out of the chapter-by-chapter discussion threads because I don't feel like crapping on peoples' good time. And every so often, EE puts up a solid, enjoyable chapter. There was one of those very recently, but now, for the life of me, I can't remember which one it was.

    Oh yeah. 

    It's weird, because EE can definitely write compelling conversations without resorting to juvenile banter. Most Black interludes, for instance. They're great because it's a nice change of pace to have a character that takes things seriously.

  I only got halfway through before i got sick but from a quick skim it just goes on the same way.  If you aren't caught up with the story ahem spoilers ahead, and I'll put it in big capital letters like the engineers do on their drawings so there's less room for misreading:

  >!THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT OF THE CHAPTER. THE ONLY CHOICE CAT MAKES IS IN THE FINAL FIGHT.!<
  ```

- u/Mashallah1488:
  ```
  I have to agree. It's been painful to read through Catherine being stuck on the same character arc, stagnating for what felt like forever instead of ever showing any character growth, and yet still being handed freebie wins by the writer. 

  Catherine being so painful to read was the reason I dropped this story.
