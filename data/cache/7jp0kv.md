  (This doesn't really go anywhere in particular. It's just some out-loud thinking about my writing as it relates to self-destruction)

  People who have read [Heroes Save the World](https://heroessavetheworld.wordpress.com) (which should be getting revived next week, sorry for the wait...) probably won't be surprised that self-destruction is a recurring theme in my works. My characters, in HSTW and elsewhere, have a tendency to, say, create doomed duplicates of themselves despite knowing there's a 50/50 chance of waking up as the duplicate, ingest poison to convince an enemy that a drink is safe, mutilate themselves to acquire magical power, or are voluntarily scapegoated in order to heal wounds in the community. 

  This usually doesn't crop up much in a single story (HSTW is a big exception, because there are so many characters), but across my stories there is a definite pattern there. Given that I've frequently gone through periods of suicidal ideation in the past, my guess is that it has something to do with that--my characters don't have much of a problem with harming themselves for the greater good because *I* don't, and I don't because my dream has often been to find something that I can sacrifice myself for so that my suicide is selfless rather than selfish. Even now, when I'm past the point of regular suicidal ideation, there's a part of me that still yearns for an opportunity like that. In my stories, it just so happens that I can arrange circumstances so that such sacrifices are both necessary and legitimately useful (as Dan Carlin said in an episode of Common Sense, if you're willing to set yourself on fire to bring attention to a cause then that cause probably needs you alive more than it needs you burning and then dead). 

  Not that this recognition means that the pattern isn't going to keep going. It's fun to see how readers will react, for one thing, but it's also genuinely cathartic to write these scenes. 

  (There could also be a religious element. I grew up Mormon, and I can't discount the idea that many of these are "types and shadows" of the crucifixion of Jesus, especially since the part of me that responds to mythology has not ceased to respond to the crucifixion. [In HSTW] (#s "I've gone so far as to explicitly draw out the parallels in a scene that transforms the self-sacrifice and symbolic cannibalism of Communion into a literal act of self-sacrifice and cannibalism to keep other people alive"). I hope that I'm not just writing Jesus expies, though. That would be kind of disappointing.)

  At any rate, for whatever reason, self-destruction is my thematic crack. Please recommend me stories where the protagonists kill themselves for the greater good. >:P

    As the one who posed the challenge, I really like that at least one person has some kind of personal resonance with it. I can certainly connect with a lot of what you've written there, as well. (The suicidal ideation parts, mostly, I've never been a Mormon.)

    > self-destruction is a recurring theme in my works

    Well, not in mine (that would probably be Metafiction), but I have a soft spot for it in the works I consume. It's still really, really hard to recommend those, mostly because the protagonist's suicide tends to be the end of the story, and usually shouldn't be spoiled. Therefore, I'll tag the names of works in the discussion below, and I'll be quite vague in my recommendations.

    I invite you to watch [spoilers as discussed](#s "Madoka and Serial Experiments Lain") if you're not averse to Anime. They're pretty different in just about every aspect, but they do share a plot, though its connection to suicidal ideation is more evident in [as above](#s "Lain than in Madoka"). I absolutely love that specific implementation of self-destruction, and I invite anyone who wants to talk to me about it to send me a pm or reply to this comment. 

    ([On the Continuity of Consciousness](http://archiveofourown.org/works/9829580/chapters/22071191), my recursive fanfiction of various Harry Potter fanfictions, covers that topic as well, though it kinda... subverts it a bit? You might not like the ending, but if you are interested in reading it, it's probably best to do so after watching [as above](#s "Lain").)

    As far as christ-y examples of heroic sacrifices go, the trope [Messianic Archetype](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MessianicArchetype) might deliver for you. As usual, the most over-the-top examples of the trope are found in the Malazan Book of the Fallen, where one character manages to sacrifice himself for roughly four different causes in quick succession.

    I would strongly recommend Bujold's *The Curse of Chalion*.

    Introduced in the very first chapter of the novel is the concept of "death magic" - one of their five gods has a ritual that will send a demon to kill the person you specify, but it kills you at the same time.  I'm certain you can see how someone who is deeply devoted to someone else might choose to use this magic.

    Sacrifice, the giving over of oneself to another, is the central theme of the work.  It is also, in my opinion, just a very good book.

    I recommend you ~~read~~ finish reading Worm. You should like the ending.

  I have long held that MIRI ought to have a large red lever labeled "self-destruct lever" which, when pulled, self-destructs.
