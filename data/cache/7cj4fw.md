  ...This is figurative, right?

  So Dizzy can control the wraiths too, surprising. And hopefully Nick isn't too much of a mess when she finds him.

  Hmm. It's weird how Davo and Fanny keep insisting that Nic is hiding of his own free will, after everything they've been through, considering what happened to Simole, and knowing that they know Nic is haunted by a demon. *Too* weird. Are they trying to get rid of Dizzy, as per Nic's adamant "under no circumstances she is to be involved" order, or is something even more weird going on?

  >If nothing else, it had been an excellent lesson in humility. He had entered the dragon’s lair as though he was a mighty warrior, worthy of the challenge. But he was a fool. A child.

  u/mooderino, I think this sentiment has been expressed enough times.

  >Even if he’d got here in time, what could he have done? It had been a stupid, childish idea. He didn’t have any power, no special abilities, no source of supernatural strength. There were certainly people like that in the world <...>, but he wasn’t one. He wasn’t special. — *Chapter 20*

  #

  >He was no match. He was a child pitted against adults. <...> Realisation of his own folly and lack of ability took him away from whatever the demon and the Archmage were talking about. It didn’t seem very important to him. — *Chapter 28*

  #

  >Nic knew he was embroiled in affairs far beyond his control. His role was only important in as far as his connection to the people who were the true players on the stage. He felt both a fraud and an unworthy participant in such momentous events. — *Chapter 30*

  #

  >He wasn’t foolish enough to think the reason he had become the focal point for such strange happenings was due to him. It wasn’t he who was special, it was the school itself, he had just been the one to unearth it. — *Chapter 35*

  It's understandable that the plot so far somewhat traumatized Nic and made him feel powerless, but maybe decrease the amount of explicit descriptions of it? At least to me, it creates an impression of "trying too hard", as if Nic/the author is trying to convince himself/the readers that Nic is totally not special, nuh-uh, right before the Grand Reveal that Nic is special and extremely talented. (Which is I'm pretty sure not the intent, but still.)

    This is one of the issues of writing a serial. It’s difficult to judge how vague/heavy-handed I’m being other than by going on reader response. If I had the liberty of rewriting and editing, it would read a lot smoother.  

    But readers are a mixed bag, and I get opposing criticisms and advice all the time.
    So, if I write a scene where a door is locked, and in the next scene a character walks through the door, some readers will point out the error, not thinking it’s intentional.   

    I can counter this by having the character say, “Wasn’t this locked earlier…” but then it’s like putting a neon sign over it, Look, important and it annoys readers who got it already.  

    And there’s the third possibility, which is that I genuinely did make a mistake.   

    Recently I’ve been getting a lot of people finding Nic to be passive and not worthy of being the MC. Which is okay if they don’t like the direction I’m taking, but it’s annoying when they don’t acknowledge it’s a deliberate choice on my part. I tend to underline and put it in bold to make a point, which is probably not the best move, but it’s tricky to find the right balance when I’m writing so many different things and also trying to sort out irl stuff.  

    You’re right to point out the redundancy (and I appreciate it) and I will be more wary of doing it again, but it will properly crop up in relation to some other element of the story. What I really need is an assistant to help me keep everything in order. But first, of course, I will be hiring a monkey butler.

      Well, I apologize, but I can't help but blame your choice of readership for it. If I understand correctly, gravitytales.com and royalroadl.com are notorious for their wish-fulfilment stories about overpowered MCs, which I imagine are usually also lacking in depth. Your comments about their feedback only confirm it: Nic *explicitly thought* about his lack of ability and power multiple times, he discussed it with Fanny and Davo, there were jokes about it, his uninterest in studying magic is important to the plot, etc. Your analogue doesn't fit: it's not a small detail akin to a closed door, it's a long-established plot point. If people still complain about it as if it's something new, I think it shows poor reading comprehension, which is a problem with the readers, not a problem with the story.

      ... Hm, okay, that last sentence was somewhat meaningless. If a story is intended for a certain kind of readers and doesn't work for them, it *is* a problem with the story. What I meant to say is that perhaps the story you want to tell is not the story meant for the audience you're likely to gather where you're publishing.

      Take this subreddit as a counterexample. Nobody here complains about Nic, they only sometimes complain about the seeming lack of plot direction.

      It's also difficult reading serials. When I read a finished story front to back (or back to front, as the case may be), it's all whole in my mind at once. When I get a chapter each week or so, it becomes difficult to keep track of details. Even larger plot points slip away. The point with the (un)locked door? When reading serially, I *need* that neon sign. When I'm reading it all at once, it becomes heavy-handed. I don't know the solution to this.

      (And when reading serial fanfiction, the problems are compounded even more, because the details get confused with canon and every other fanfic I've ever read. I read one HP fanfic where the writer was determined not to make Rowling's mistake and to make sure Flint graduated, specifically mentioning he wasn't on the quidditch team. And a few chapters later, there he is, team captain.)

  Does anybody else have a problem with the site being very resource intensive? I've tried chrome and firefox on windows, and firefox on linux, and it uses whole 1 processor core.

    Yes, this website is awful. I suggest using an adblocker. This bookmarklet also seems to help:

        javascript:(function(){var newSS, styles='* { background: black ! important; color: white !important } :link, :link * { color: #0000EE%20!important%20}%20:visited,%20:visited%20*%20{%20color:%20#551A8B%20!important%20}';%20if(document.createStyleSheet)%20{%20document.createStyleSheet("javascript:'"+styles+"'");%20}%20else%20{%20newSS=document.createElement('link');%20newSS.rel='stylesheet';%20newSS.href='data:text/css,'+escape(styles);%20document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0].appendChild(newSS);%20}%20})();

  The ending of the nested story reminds me of the poem "Power of Taste" by Zbigniew Herbert:

      It didn't require great character at all
      our refusal disagreement and resistance
      we had a shred of necessary courage
      but fundamentally it was a matter of taste
                                      Yes taste
      in which there are fibers of soul the cartilage of conscience

      Who knows if we had been better and more attractively tempted
      sent rose-skinned women thin as a wafer
      or fantastic creatures from the paintings of Hieronymus Bosch
      but what kind of hell was there at this time
      a wet pit the murderers' alley the barrack
      called a palace of justice
      a home-brewed Mephisto in a Lenin jacket
      sent Aurora's grandchildren out into the field
      boys with potato faces
      very ugly girls with red hands

      Verily their rhetoric was made of cheap sacking
      (Marcus Tullius kept turning in his grave)
      chains of tautologies a couple of concepts like flails
      the dialectics of slaughterers no distinctions in reasoning
      syntax deprived of beauty of the subjunctive

      So aesthetics can be helpful in life
      one should not neglect the study of beauty

      Before we declare our consent we must carefully examine
      the shape of the architecture the rhythm of the drums and pipes
      official colors the despicable ritual of funerals

                Our eyes and ears refused obedience
                the princes of our senses proudly chose exile

      It did not require great character at all
      we had a shred of necessary courage
      but fundamentally it was a matter of taste
                                  Yes taste
      that commands us to get out to make a wry face draw out a sneer
      even if for this the precious capital of the body the head
                                                      must fall
