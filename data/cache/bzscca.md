## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding and Writing Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*
* Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is *also* the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  A lot of standard vampire mythology holds that they can't eat or drink (consequences ranging from disgust to pain to death). Well, of course, they can drink blood, naturally.

  A lot of standard human anthropology holds that people like to take mind altering substances, alcohol being the most popular [citation needed] because it just requires leaving plants to rot and then being bananas enough to try and consume them anyway [citation needed].

  So, how could vampires get drunk?

    Responding to my own post with the obvious suggestions for people to riff on:

    - Get the humans drink enough and their blood is an (extremely dilute) alcoholic beverage in itself ! (So in the rules of this system, you probably can't dilute human blood with ethanol and make a 6% beer for a vampire that way: say the upper limit of spiking blood with ethanol is the upper limit a human's blood contain without killing the human, in which case we're extremely charitably able to get human blood to a 1% alcohol volume which is pitiful)

    - Magic potions. Yawn. 

    - Heroin, coke, etc - anything that doesn't require an oral route. Presumably something absorbed by snorting might still count as "eating"? And heroin doesn't necessarily affect vampires the same way?

    - Turns out werewolf(say) blood gets vampires drunk - this is interesting, but why?

      I've seen this used alongside the idea that vampires have truly *atrocious* alcohol tolerance, so that 1% really hits them *hard*.

      Another option; alcohol is more or less fruit (often grapes) that have gone a little bit *off* in a very specific way. How do vampires react to blood that's been allowed to ferment a little? (*Can* blood ferment? I presume it can because it's organic, at least if you can keep it from clotting first...)

        > Can blood ferment? 

        Sugars are what ferments; blood doesn't really contain much sugar at all, the calories come from protein. So blood wouldn't ferment the same way that if you leave a hunk of cow flesh out for long enough, it will rot rather than ferment.

        So no, unfortunately, I think blood can't really ferment. 

        > I've seen this used alongside the idea that vampires have truly atrocious alcohol tolerance, so that 1% really hits them hard.

        The problem with that is as someone else said, vampires are meant to be "better" than humans - if they can heal a massive arm wound, why are they suddenly not able to metabolise a mild poison? (admittedly, those are two very different systems in the body)
        ```

        - u/CCC_037:
          ```
          Maybe the rot hits vampires the same way as alcohol? Or they have to mix in a lot of sugar into the blood and then let *that* ferment?

          [](/piecupcakeget) Or you just feed some a whole lot of sugar, then extract and ferment their blood?

          [](/sp)

          > The problem with that is as someone else said, vampires are meant to be "better" than humans - if they can heal a massive arm wound, why are they suddenly not able to metabolise a mild poison? (admittedly, those are two very different systems in the body)

          Maybe they can metabolise it instantly - but they can *also* turn that ability off temporarily, in the same way as humans, despite having to breathe, are able to hold their breath for a while. (This also means that vampires would have a limit as to *how* drunk thy can get, because they can't get drunk enough to stop 'holding their metabolism').

          --------------

          Alternative: vampires can heal everything *except* blood, which they have to replace. Drinking enough blood from drunk people leads to a drunk vampire, who will then *stay* drunk until such time as he drinks some blood from enough sober people to thin out the alcohol a bit. (And regrowing an arm leads to a massively thirsty vampire because he's got to get an arm's worth of blood from *somewhere*).

            Feeding someone a lot of sugar won't make their blood sugar high enough to make it fermentable: if you don't have diabetes, you're going to digest that appropriately rather than have it go in the blood all willy nilly, and if you do have diabetes, you'll go in a coma and presumably die before it gets up to fermentable levels of sugar.... 

            > but they can also turn that ability off temporarily, in the same way as humans, despite having to breathe, are able to hold their breath for a while

            I like this idea, and I especially like the implication that you can only get drunk if you choose to, and you can un-drunk yourself at will

            >  vampires can heal everything except blood, which they have to replace. 

            This is brilliant! If you drink only drunk humans you get drunk, and then you stay as drunk as the average human you drank. I'm not sure if I want to use it or not but I love it, and I think it's the cleanest, most sensible way for vampires to work. It also has some interesting corrollaries, like vampires can inherit the hormones from their food source (so drinking from scared humans all the time = scared vampire), which might explain why vampries might prefer willing, calm prey.
            ```

              Yeah - it also implies that you can't get a vampire unwillingly drunk, i.e. by spiking his drink.

              > If you drink only drunk humans you get drunk, and then you stay as drunk as the average human you drank. I'm not sure if I want to use it or not but I love it, and I think it's the cleanest, most sensible way for vampires to work.

              It has implications for any scene involving vampires, really, because hormones have a lot to do with emotions. Vampires can presumably control themselves well, whatever emotions they might be feeling under the surface; but a vampire who recently ate from a vampire hunter will probably be feeling combatative and punchy for a while after. On the flip side - and importantly for vampire romances - a young woman in a low-cut nightie is not going to get the reaction she might be expecting from a vampire, unless he has a sip from some other guy who's had the relevant hormones floating around in his blood. (This might even be a reason why many vampires seek human mates and *don't* want to turn their partners, because they enjoy having someone around who can provide the relevant hormones for them to partake of).

                I'm more thinking, the hormonal thing is really going to heavily strengthen your attachments to the humans you feed on as individuals; if you feed from a man who is crazy about you, afterwards you have this wonderful glow of love that persists. If you feed from him exclusively, well, he'll die, but you'll always have a ~10% level of love from him just from the feeding thing, which spikes after feeding. It's... interesting. A manipulative human might make sure they are in adoring bliss mood before offering their neck to their vampire, just to make sure the effect is as potent.

                That said, thinking about My Vampires, they must produce hormones if their brain is working normally, and I'm sure that oxytocin or whatever has a short half life in the body. So the hormonal effects are only going to be immediate, and probably not that strong. 

                (actually if we have the alcohol rule, probably whatever breaks down alcohol breaks down other hormones, so maybe not?)

                I don't know. This is fascinating to think about and my knowledge of physiology is limited to first year university, so I know just enough to get into trouble...

                  That depends on what the human is feeling. If the vampire feeds exclusively from humans who feel scared, then he's hardly doing to feel attached to them - and if he feeds from humans who find the act of being fed on innately distasteful, then he's going to eventually face his mealtimes with disgust.

                  If, on the other hand, the human enjoys the process, well, then it will likely strengthen their bonds.

                  But yeah, it would have all sorts of implications, and my knowledge of physiology never ever reached first-year university levels...

                    ```
                    Yeah, thinking about how the hormonal effects are likely to work, I think the vampires are either going to run on human hormones or run on vampire hormones. If they run on human hormones, then feeding gives them a nice, small blast of adreneline / oxytocin / whatever, which their physiology is able to attenuate the same way it attenuates the adreneline the vampires produce naturally. 

                    Or, is the reason vampires are so dangerous because these fear hormones build up in their blood from feeding on humans, and the only way they can get rid of them is by depositing them back into the next human they feed from as a waste product?? Are vampires just dangerous because they're "scared", and feeding on scared humans means the affect doesn't attenuate? It's an interesting thought. 

                    The other option is vampire hormones run on some sort of vampire-specific system, in which case the human hormones are irrelevant (unless they're grandafthered in, I guess?)

      I'd say it all depends on the mythology.Are the vamps dead?  If so, no liver function, no intoxication.  Also, if the blood isn't pumping, kinda hard for intoxicants to hit the bloodstream and have an effect.

      Is vampirism a curse/virus?  If so, they're not really dead, per se, so all the standard human functions should work, such as liver processing toxins.  Perhaps they just have an incredible tolerance simply because the regeneration provided by their curse causes the poisoning that is intoxication to be healed entirely too quickly for most people's delights.  Bring on the kegs!!  Seriously, 3 for me and 2 for my friend here.

      You can take alcohol non-orally as well, right? I mean, it's not necessarily healthy or a particularly sane thing to do, but you _can_ get drunk that way and, well, see your original comment about being bananas enough to do it anyway.

      Another idea is just fermenting blood like how you'd ferment grains or fruits. It wouldn't be the easiest process, but I think some determined vampires would go through with it.
      ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    I actually do think there's something to vampires adulterating blood in order to consume mind-altering substances, especially if there's some bit of vampire mythology that means it has to be *fresh* blood. Injecting someone with straight alcohol and then draining them of their blood before they die is pretty metal, and fits will with vampire decadence, as well as being kind of horrifying.

    Works best on the "only blood because of disgust" type, I feel, because there you'd be using blood to mask the taste of something else.

  I'm writing a world with a bunch of magic systems. So I'll probably be doing a bunch of these (once a week). These are mostly to confirm what I already thought of but to make sure I'm not missing any consequences or ideas *about the magic* not necessarily the spells I present as examples. I'm mostly interested in munchkin opportunities and professions in a modern world. [Previous Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/bx3lvb/d_wednesday_worldbuilding_and_writing_thread/eq51qez/)

  Sigil Magic. Sigil magic is about using a metaphorical pictogram to describe an effect (on conceptual objects). The sigils can be drawn in or of anything, as the spell works it course it erodes itself, a metal wrought sigil will evaporate, a drawing in sand will become homogeneous again, ink on paper will evaporate along with a portion of the paper thinning it (the power of the spell relative to the material consume will determine it's life time or potency, a weak spell made of iron might last decades, a powerful spell made in sand might last less than an eye-blink). Unlike many other magics sigils don't count against universal enchantment limits of the caster - they do however consume a relatively large amount of raw materials for the effects they provide - so in theory they can create effects of unlimited power, to do so would require forging a sigil of such size in a single casting.

  Examples:

  * Translation Sigil: A sigil of two people talking allows people touching the sigil to understand each other when they talk.
  * Firestarter Sigil: A sigil of a fire allows the user to start a fire by touching it to something flammable.
  * Traps: Carvings in stone of people meeting brutal deaths in certain locations of a building are a common mechanism for security. Though as a practical matter this often involves walls and walls of slight variants of the same pictogram to catch edge cases and prevent a single variant from being burned out quickly.
  * Magic Items: Most magic items are forged with sigils.
  * Power Sources: While the cost (in both materials and labor) of using sigils as common power sources is untenable, many things do use sigil engines of one form or another as a power source.
  * Other Magics: Refinements to sigil magic over the millennia have created other magics, weaker and more constrained yet with an easier representation of concepts like sequences, conditions, and so on.

  Charles X Xavier should have been the main supervillain in the X-men universe.  
  \- His main motivation is to build a world where mutants and humans can coexist peacefully.

  \- there's no better superpower than his for this purpose.  
  \- He's known to have controlling tendencies, eg. controlling Jean Grey.

  - u/None:
    ```
    I think he'd make for a great villain in an AU X-Men series, but I don't think he's a good fit for being the main villain for the main X-Men. The main continuity X-Men are fairly mainstream, a villain who's less morally grey and more evil is easier and safer to do. Also it's useful to have the main villain in super hero series be able to have big fight scenes, Professor X could be taken down easily by anyone with a mind control resisting helmet like Magneto, so you'd never get a climatic fight scene with him outside of perhaps a mental battle. 

    But I'd definitely like to see an AU with a plotline like maybe Magneto is employing solely moral methods to fulfill his goal of a mutants-only world, like peacefully creating a mutants nation and only using violence in self-defense, but Charles employs any means necessary to place himself as a dictator who can force through civil rights reform.
    ```

  - u/Silver_Swift:

    I kinda like the theory that Charles is a good guy primarily because of his abilities. After all it's a lot easier to see the good in people if you can literally see the world from their perspective.

  Maybe too late to post, but here goes.

  I'm imagining a futuristic "hellene" society. In the distant past the roman empire  never took root, and as a result the west stayed under Greek hegemony for much longer and its influence is significantly magnified even into the present(1900's or so, equivalent tech development of a cyberpunk 2077 or thereabouts).  The main divergence would be that [Pyrrhus of Epirus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrrhus_of_Epirus) wipes the floor with the Romans instead of eking out a few close victories (maybe pyhrric victory would come to mean an overwheliming victory?) and establishes a dynasty that rules over Sicily and most of Italy and some of the Balkans. 

  Think of how much of european civilization is built on or inspired by the romans, how much of an effect they had on every level of society. Now imagine that there is a greek replacement in terms of culture, but not in terms of size or scope, a more distributed pan-hellene meditarranean which survives the "barbarians" invasions better(better use of cavalry and so on), which does not succumb to Christianity(which never existed, together with Islam), and which views intellectual pursuits significantly more positively, and is thus able to advance technologically much more quickly. 



  Anyway, **the point of this post**: in a cyberpunk-ish dystopian future, a Hellene-descended government in europe has a similar problem as we do now with regard to the replacement rate, i.e. not having enough children. They institute a breeding program with the initial aim of making and raising children, but which gets distorted by utopian(or dystopian if you're lower class) ideals into making "perfect", idealized citizens. 

  The program has 4 lineages (sort of like a soft caste system) which aims to encompass the entirety of the elites in a society. 

  * Fates - The ruling lineage - civil, political and military leaders, strategists
  * Furies - The enforcement/physical lineage - warriors, police, athletes
  * Muses - The intellectual lineage - philosopher, scientists, artists
  * Graces - The support lineage - engineers, doctors, psychologists, priests, etc. 

  Thoughts? Is there something that I'm missing? I also don't like that these 4 are orignially all women, is there any male groups that would fit in this theme? Is there any story that has a divergent hellene empire type of deal that I can use for inspiration? Any historical site or book or video that you'd recommend for some insight into ancient greek culture?

    You could try looking into modern Hellenistic polytheists for inspiration, see if there’s anything that you can adapt and scale up. 

    The easy solution I can think of is to make something up or pull from somewhere else. Some other culturally significant forces had to have popped up in the last ~3000 years, draw from that. I think a monotheistic religion makes sense as a foil/contrast. Maybe Judaism has a larger influence?

    Also, have they not figured out genetic modification, or the possibility of it as a method? It would be a lot more practical than breeding systems, and could also correct sex disparities. Though I wasn’t aware countries other than Japan were currently having problems with replacement rate.

    Having all four groups be named after women might make sense if the lineages are matrilinear: if your mother was a Fury, you're of that lineage.

    I assume you've already looked at Plato's Republic, but if not that has a lot of material for what a Hellene-descended breeding program and utopia could look like.

    You've mentioned how a Hellene civilisation would better resist the forces that caused the fall of Rome. How would other key historical events have changed, like the Columbian exchange or the Black Death?

    Christianity not having existed is huge. do native Americans still practice their native culture and religion or do Greek gods demand absolute homage? there's no Spanish Inquisition or witch hunts. certainly no discrimination of LGBT people. do LGBT people then get discriminated because they don't reproduce?  do Americans still believe in Providence? is beer still a thing? without the dark ages, are people still going to have a Renaissance? are black people still going to be enslaved?

    Islam not having existed is also huge. does India still get conquered and Buddhism all but wiped out? without a buffer in the middle East, do we see a direct clash of Hellenistic empires and china? do people still drink coffee?
