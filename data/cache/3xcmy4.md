## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  Just spent the morning looking at OCR (optical  character recognition ) software and my thought was ... pretty good,  but it's 5 years from being truly done.  Which was my exact thought from 20 years ago. The real strides are in making it easier for people to confirm or correct. 

  The implications for this with respect to AI?  Possibly none, but this is a multi billion dollar industry and they don't seem able to solve this. FWIW

    That's a result of the 90-90 rule. The first 90% of the code accounts for 90% of the development time, while the last 10% of the code accounts for the remaining 90% of the development time. The less tongue-in-cheek version is a version of the Pareto principle; 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes. My experience with software development suggests that OCR is *still* not going to be truly done in another ten years, but it will probably be good enough for *most* use cases, with development effort slowly dropping off after that.

    One of the arguments given by Bostrom, Yudkowsky, et. al. is that we don't really have any idea where superintelligence lies on the scale of effort for AI development. It might be that once we have a proper model, the jump to 1000 IQ is equivalent to getting a computer to read text in a single font and a single color from a page situated the perfect distance away from the camera under ideal conditions. Or it might be that *100 IQ* is that equivalent. Or *50 IQ*. If we assume that there are big easy chunks and small hard chunks, then that still doesn't really help us because we don't know what our curve of difficulty/effort looks like.

      I feel like part of the confusion is that everyone expects "general intelligence" to be a single "master algorithm" (a Google talk actually has this title), whereas I think there actually exists a large space of learning algorithms capable of inducing arbitrary programs (causal structures) with greatly varying degrees of compression/generalization/transfer learning.  And even once you've got one of those, you have to hook it up to good perceptual algorithms.

      So we should really ask two questions: which algorithms, with what degree of implementation efficiency?

    Alex St. John thinks that we're pursuing AI [the wrong way](http://www.alexstjohn.com/WP/2015/06/24/no-azimov-ai/). He argues, essentially, that while simulating biological processes is possible digitally (per [Shannon's proof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Symbolic_Analysis_of_Relay_and_Switching_Circuits)), it's hopelessly inefficient compared to the massively-parallel atomic-level physics tricks than life can pull with organic chemistry.

    He proposes that minds, of flatworms or of humans, don't operate like computers at all. Our ability to simulate them in simple or specific situations is, from his perspective, essentially a parlor trick: We're fooling ourselves into believing that computers think like animals, rather than actually creating computers that do so.

    Agree or not, it's a thought-provoking read... even if he can't spell Asimov.

      I think he really needs to say what kind of "computers" he means.  From the theoretical perspective, it's all Turing-complete, which is why that theoretical perspective is largely uninformative.

      EDIT: Oh God my head.  Why did I click on that link?  That was one of the stupidest things I've read in a while.  I mean, I've got a friend who claims cognition has to involve infinite-precision real numbers and Lebesgue measures, but that's why he's designing a programming language semantics linked to physics.  He's *wrong*, but he at least manages to be wrong without being a *fucking crackpot* like the guy who simultaneously claims that the real universe uses infinite-precision real numbers (it sure might) *and* "computes" with them (which is flatly impossible).

  It just so happens that, in the upcoming set, Magic: The Gathering is printing a card called Endbringer. Does anyone know how to get into contact with Wildbow to ask him what he thinks about altering the art of that card into depictions of The Simurgh?

  WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!

  A lot of things came together for me this week, but waking up by 4:00 to Skype into a meeting where the image and sound are grainy and everyone tries to teach each-other Babby's First AIXI while you're mostly still bleary... does not work.

  So I now feel somewhat guilty on top of my normal mental and emotional background.

  WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!

  Edit: New episode of *If the Emperor Had a Text-to-Speech Device* is out today!  YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES!

  Is anyone watching *The Expanse*?  I enjoyed the books, but haven't seen the TV show yet.

    My expectations for Syfy projects are rock bottom, but I was pleasantly surprised. They're doing wonders with what is obviously a rather small budget, and it carries over the dirty, corrupt future feel of the books. Good eye for detail, and harder sci-fi than you might expect. Give it a try.
    ```

    - u/Escapement:
      ```
      I just saw the first episode of the *The Magicians*, another Syfy adaptation. The pacing is markedly faster than the books, and a lot of plot elements are different. However, it's still pretty interesting and technically very well done. I am cautiously optimistic, and at the very least will be trying the next couple of episodes as well.

  Let's talk about rationality in regard to names.

  Yesterday I heard an expecting couple discussing possible names for their child. They kept saying phrases like, "He doesn't feel like a Nathan."

  From a rational standpoint, that's ridiculous. The reason your child doesn't feel like a certain name is because of your own personal biases. In fact, the most rational thing you could when naming a child is to research what name gives them the most advantages in their life. Does the name stand out? Is it memorable? What immediate emotions/thoughts will it illicit in others?

  In your opinion, what is the most rational name you can give a child (boy or girl)?
  ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    I think you ideally give them a name that they can alter for themselves as they grow and change as people. You don't know which name is going to be most advantageous, because you don't know what skills or aptitudes your child is going to be able to leverage. So when trying to find a name, you want to find one that's modifiable, which probably means that it's longer. So, for example, "Theodore" can be "Ted", "Teddy", or "Theo" depending on the circumstances (with none of the difficulty or social stigma of actually changing name).

    An alternate consideration is having a name that's unique enough that search algorithms can find them or common enough that they can't, depending on preference. Getting confused with other people that have your same name is a hassle.

    And stay away from names that reflect low class or leave unfavorable impressions.

    Try not to give your children names belonging very identifiably to minority ethnicities.  I'm not sure if it's stereotype-expectation effects or what, but it does seem a little harder to grow up normal that way.
    ```

    - u/Gcrein:
      ```
      Are you referring to the research about how people named LaShawnduh (for example) have a more difficult time finding employment than people named Jennifer (also for example)?
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        Yes, although I've more experienced being "the Jew in the room".
        ```

  - u/Sparkwitch:
    ```
    I think the best names are ones that are unusual, but not *too* unusual. That's actually one of the advantages of naming children after their grandparents: Names that were popular two generations ago are still familiar, but no longer omni-present.

    I also wanted a good excuse to post a link to [this toy](http://www.babynamewizard.com/voyager#prefix=&sw=both&exact=false). It's a super fun way to waste some time.
