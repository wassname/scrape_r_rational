  Quick summary?
  ```

  - u/ToaKraka:
    ```
    The protagonist is a 400-year-old necromancer who has survived for so long by keeping his head down. His body is failing him, and immortality is impossible without becoming a lich (which The&nbsp;Holy&nbsp;Kingdom™ would immediately detect and destroy), so his plan is to transfer his soul to the body of a prince of The&nbsp;Holy&nbsp;Kingdom™.
