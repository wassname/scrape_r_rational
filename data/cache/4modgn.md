      > A monstergirl story with a main character who isn't a weak little boy? Is that even allowed?

      No shota? That's HERESY!

      Now seriously, its great that they're diversifying their work. I wonder if Monster Girl Quest set the trend for shota protagonists or its a cultural thing from earlier.
      ```

      - u/Rhamni:
        ```
        Maybe it's just to accentuate that monster girls are supposed to be 'powerful'. That said, lots of anime have useless twelve year old existentialist boys for main characters (though not on the level of Luka), so monstergirl stuff probably just taps into an existing trope and exaggerates it.
        ```

        - u/AugSphere:
          ```
          Now that I think about it, I suspect that the deciding factor in MGQ was probably the desire of artists to draw monster nee-sans having their way with a cute shota, rather than story-telling considerations.
          ```

            And vore, don't forget the vore.

            I have to admit the story was impressive and I loved Promestein's character and last lines. She could have been a great rational protagonist too and her cause was just even if her methods weren't.

              > And vore, don't forget the vore.

              The vore is hard to forget. One of the more memorable parts of the game, I'd say. Now you've also given me the gift of an amusing mental image of a poor monster-girl trying in vain to stuff a beefy protagonist down her gullet.

              > I have to admit the story was impressive and I loved Promestein's character and last lines. She could have been a great rational protagonist too and her cause was just even if her methods weren't.

              I thought the story was a bit simplistic, to be honest. It felt like Promestein's side-plot was tacked on without being properly integrated with the main narrative and underdeveloped overall. It's a bit disappointing, since it resonates much stronger with me than the trite "love that overcomes all obstacles" main plot.

    I don't know if I should hate you for recommending this or thanking you. :D

    Awesome story, couldn't stop reading it, but sadly it's not really rational, especially near the end.
    ```

    - u/whywhisperwhy:
      ```
      Yeah I couldn't help but feel the author had let their main character grow too fast, too quickly and thus had to come up with a contrived scenario to make things interesting. And, you know, in general just trying to make anyone aligned with the protagonist happy/successful with no backlash.

      Crackfic at the beginning, though, and very well-written. Maybe it's because I'm taking an interest in RPGs but I also felt like the author did a wonderful job fleshing out their characters.

  ```
  "The Dagger and the Coin" Quintet by Daniel Abraham.  

  It's entirely rational except for one thing, which is perhaps explainable with in-universe reasons.

  The author's been recommended here before for a short story, and I've recommended him as well.  I've heard good things about his other works, but can't attest to their rationality myself.  I'd wager they are, though.  He seems an author of a thoroughly rational bent.

    I read The Dragon's Path, but it didn't particularly catch my interest. How do you think the rest of the series compares?

    [The Cambist and Lord Iron](http://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/the-cambist-and-lord-iron-a-fairy-tale-of-economics/), however, is excellent; I highly recommend it.

  - u/Drexer:
    ```
    I've read 11 chapters, does it get any better?

    It's not that the character is blunt or rude, although the fact that he's an asshole even beyond his anxiety to communicate with others doesn't do him any favours. But between his obsession that he must be in a game and so many avenues of exploration left unsaid, it kind of gets on my nerves if it won't ever grow into semi-competent exploration of the situation.
    ```

  - u/AurelianoTampa:
    ```
    Seeing this recommendation I decided to try it out. Like /u/Drexer, I was... less than impressed with the beginning. The main character is so damn unlikable. But the chapters are short, and sometimes wit, humor, and memes showed through, so I stuck with it.

    Now it's less than a day later and I'm on chapter 80. I've laughed out loud plenty of times. The MC is still really unlikable but more in a curmudgeonly way than an outright asshole like he first was. Still pretty frustrating with his sexist tirades, though. I don't know the age of the author, but I wouldn't be surprised if he was mid-20s or younger - the immaturity that oozes through the MC's words just seems too genuine. But hey, if the author is instead a woman in her mid-40s or something, damn good job getting into the head of an annoying male college student! 

    I wouldn't necessarily call it rationalist fiction (because the MC lacks the social grace to make rational choices and seems to have INSANELY good luck), but it's really humorous and catchy. I feel like the story caught its stride after the first score of chapters - probably about the time they found the, uh, unicorn bunnies. 

    Thanks for the suggestion!
    ```

    - u/whywhisperwhy:
      ```
      Eh, I'll concede "rational-ish" because the universe seems to have some help guiding it, but I would say that for their stated values the main character acts consistently and logically. It's not high quality fiction though, I'd agree, just entertaining.

      Definitely also agree that the main character's sexist views are annoying. Along those lines, I wanted to warn that literally the day after I posted this, the most recent chapter took a rather disgusting turn so I'm going to edit my post to note that it's graphic.
      ```

      - u/Drexer:
        ```
        What was exactly that disgusting turn? I'm either desensitised or I skipped a paragraph because nothing in the latter chapters jumped out at me as specially problematic.

        The sexism of the main character doesn't bother me as much because it's clearly the main character, and the story lampshades it enough while his thoughts seem more taken from the frontpage of reddit than someone would think and write non-ironically. I'm more bothered by how the universe apparently agrees with him.

        [](#s "For instance the girl group from the start which simply gave up and killed themselves, or how none of the women in the groups really had any physical self-improvement in combat or otherwise when all of the group, male and female, coming from our world should be around the same 'flat-line' of abilities compared to what they might gain from training.")

        Actually, one question /u/whywhisperwhy and /u/AurelianoTampa , do you feel that, excluding the sexual content of the story, if the characters were 15-16 years old instead of 19-20 it would work better? There have been a lot of occasions where their stereotypical behaviour has seemed unfounded to me for their age, but could easily be justified by pulling them towards the more common years of immaturity of their adolescences.
        ```

        - u/whywhisperwhy:
          ```
          [Chpt 92ish - ](#s "The girl the main character is accompanying get stabbed in the genitals, slick with blood, and he basically fingers her for healing purposes. And if I remember right, he smells his hand afterwards and talks about masturbating to that scene later.")

          I don't know how much of a difference changing the ages would make to me- depending on the people, ages 15-19 doesn't change maturity much imo, unfortunately. I think it was implied most of them were university students? That kind of behavior still happens at that point, so I didn't feel like it was too ridiculous.
          ```

        - u/AurelianoTampa:
          ```
          >do you feel that, excluding the sexual content of the story, if the characters were 15-16 years old instead of 19-20 it would work better?

          Hmmm, maybe... but I feel like /u/whywhisperwhy is correct when he says the characters act consistently. The MC *does* act like a socially reclusive and antisocial late teen without any higher education might act. If their ages skewed lower the behavior might be more forgivable and less alienating to readers. But even at their current ages I think it's still believable. Heck, I'm sure we all know people several years older than the characters who behave and think far worse.

          I actually think it would be less believable with younger ages in some ways. At 15-16 you could be jaded and cynical, but usually it's based on emotional rebellion (feeling superior because you're stand-offish and act like an asshole). At 19-20, I more easily buy that the MC is just depressed and cynical, but still has the life experience to detach himself from others and think about the situation in a different way. He's an asshole not because being an asshole is cool, but because he expects nothing from the world and doesn't give anything back to it. I see that as requiring more years of experience than a 15 year old would have.

          Yeah, thinking about it, the ages work. If he was 5-10 years older he'd probably have his temper under control and at least be smart enough to think before he goes off on people. At 19-20, he has enough experience to recognize the illogical actions of his group but not enough to stop himself from making things worse with his outbursts.

          Not sure if that answered your question or just rambled ;-)
          ```

          - u/Drexer:
            ```
            It did both things, but do not worry because that was the purpose of my question. :)

            To me the question of the ages was less about the main character and more about the other visitors, as their organization in stereotypical high-school groups seemed to me much more of an younger behaviour than a university behaviour. But then I reminded myself that my local culture and behaviours in that regard can be wildly different than the UK one, so maybe it's minimally consistent?

            It just seems to me like the behaviour of the other groups/characters is far too similar to what one would expect from a teen movie to feel realistic.

  Alright, what I'm really looking for right now are at least semi-rational romances along the lines of **["What Do You Want?"](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11840095/1/What-Do-You-Want)** from one of the latest writing challenges here. I have always been a sucker for romance, but I do hate manufactured drama and stupid characters. So stories where the characters deal with issues reasonably and the story isn't driven by drama that could be solved with a five minute conversation. Anyone have stories like this, whether fanfiction or anime? The romance itself doesn't have to be the main focus of the plot.

    Have you read the  [Spatterjay] (https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/240297.The_Skinner) trilogy? [Acts of Caine](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/311864.Heroes_Die?from_search=true&search_version=service) is a mix of Science fiction and Fantasy, and is suitably bloody. While I have mixed feeling about it myself, I believe some people here might like [The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/64341.The_Metamorphosis_of_Prime_Intellect?from_search=true&search_version=service)
    ```

  - u/Panksworth:
    ```
    Whilst I've read and admittedly enjoyed the Spatterjay trilogy mentioned in another comment, it does read like it's been written for young adults. Predictable in places but overall enjoyable. 

    Whilst not especially violent Iain M Banks' The Culture remains the best science fiction creation I have ever encountered. I don't claim to have understood all of it but they are fantastic books if you haven't read them. 

    I remember Use of Weapons being particularly dark in places.

    "A Deepness in the Sky" by Vernor Vinge gets pretty dark.  So dark that I had to put it down for a while because of how horrible some characters were being.  Not sure how rational it is, but the characters are intelligent and as a Physics undergrad, I found no issues with the science.
    ```

    - u/OrzBrain:
      ```
      *Marooned in Realtime* by Vernor Vinge is the best science fiction book I have ever read. Hell, it's the best book period I have ever read. And one of the few that has ever made me cry. He really makes you feel the wonder of the possibilities of intelligence enhancement and related tech by the device of (among other things) showing people who had previously been enhanced to very high levels operating without many of their enhancements and resources and doing things that look to the reader positively superhuman, but which seem to them rather pathetic. 

      Hmm, I don't think I explained that very well. That's only a part of it. The rest is a lot of absolutely brilliant writing, and also a heartrendingly sad story of a person marooned in a hostile environment without support struggling with everything they have against the inevitability of death and decay.

    I found myself annoyed at the inconsistent power levels. They describe mages as *very* powerful, and that doesn't mesh with the amount of them there are when you look at their effects on society.

    Then they revealed that the nation they've spent months traveling through is a small, probably third world, "island" nation. It's the size of eurasia, but not big by local standards.

  Well....I had a list of things I wanted to recommend, but I misplaced it so I'm going to go with the only three I remember.

  [All Night Laundry](http://www.all-night-laundry.com/) which is an awesome interactive illustrated serial story about time-travel and Lovecraftian abominations. Fairly rational since the characters are intelligent and the readers actually want Bina to succeed unlike other MSPA forum stories where the readers were just giving goofy commands. Been updating **daily** for three years now and the author has never missed an update deadline yet.

  [Prequel](http://www.prequeladventure.com/2015/10/3834/) is a really good character-development story about a Kajit from Elder Scrolls trying to turn her life around from alcoholism and inexplicable nightmares by running away to another town to reinvent herself in an attempt to improve her life. It's not rational, but it's not irrational either, since she has very good reasons for messing up. She genuinely struggles with bad luck, alcoholism, and being homeless/poor (and maybe some depression), but it's all about being optimistic and taking matters into one's own hands to make life better rather than relying on luck or others to do it for you. The first few posts should be enough to decide if you like it.

  [Dark Horse](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/235720/dark-horse-a-five-score-tale-from-the-dresden-files) is a really good cross-over between *My Little Pony* and the *Dresden series*. Nothing glaringly rational or irrational. I don't think any more needs to be said.

  Recommending Berserk, a dark fantasy manga (and old anime). Nobody's *stupid*, but the mc does solve his problems with the power of a 600 pound 'sword' rather than using his brain. What it has going for it though is very good characters, a world darker than Lovecraft, and demons.

  In a somewhat unusual way of structuring things, I recommend (strongly) that if you read it you start with the 'Golden Age' arc, which starts at the end of volume 3 and runs all the way to volume 14. This is where a 'flashback' starts that is about 100 chapters long, and the plot twist at the end of it is revealed in the non-flashback chapters that precede it. Reading everything in publication order is like walking into the cinema to watch Lord of the Rings with giant posters outside saying "You'll be so sad when Gandalf dies, but then he doesn't!"

  Anyway. The anime agrees with me. It skips most of the stuff before the 'flashback'. Though even there, skip the first episode for optimal enjoyment.

  Recommending [Sankarea](http://kissmanga.com/Manga/Sankarea/Sankarea-1?id=3097) manga. Really interesting dark and weird supernatural romance story about zombies.

  I like the Transhumanist angle of trying to overcome death that its explored a little bit in the later arcs.

  The characters interact nicely and the story picks up after the first arc conclusion. I like how they discuss their problems unlike most cliché works where all the drama comes from misunderstandings. Be warned though that its not a rational work.

  --------------------------------------

  Also looking for something like [Mother of Learning](https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/1/Mother-of-Learning). I love time travel stories and protagonists that try to optimize their situation, particularly if they use logic to overcome their problems.
