  I read two webnovels this week, both of which I liked.

  **[Vigor Mortis](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/40373/vigor-mortis)**. I Gotta say the Hype is well justified. The worldbuilding is very unique, I was worried after hearing that the MC is a necromancer (It's a bit overplayed in webnovels in my opinion) but the novel has a very unique spin on it. I don't really have any complaints on what I've read so far, maybe dial down on showing us how poor Vita is and was. I got it after the first few times it came up.

  The next was a new sci-fi series on RRL. It's just starting up so there isn't much to really talk about, what's there I loved. There are a few creative uses of powers. **[Cosmosis: Above The Sky](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/43212/cosmosis-above-the-sky)**, is what it's called. 

  And since this is the first time I am posting here **[Displaced](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/15538/displaced)** is one of my favourite webnovels. I think this sub would love one of the male main characters who is basically a more rational >!fantasy iron man!<.

      >!6!< people from Earth are dropped on >!6!< different areas on a  new world. As the story goes along you learn about the new world, see how the political balance of the world shifts with the arrival of the Earthers, how our main characters carve a life for themselves in the very unfriendly new world, what happens when they meet etc.. all of which sounds like classic Isekai story beats.

      The story is good because of the writing but has a weak premise. It's not as attention capturing in the first chapters as something like "Into another world as a hive of telepathic beavers". The story instead gets progressively better and better.

        In the first three chapters both the protagonist and the big antagonist organization are shown to be actually incompetent. It feels like they're not even trying to achieve their stated goals.

          Chapter 5 is where Blake's arc ends to be picked up later in chapter 15. Read till there, if you don't like what Blake is doing, Maybe you would like Arlette (chapter 6 - 14), But I remember her story being even slower to get started.

    I really wanted to like Displaced, but I just could not stand Blake's character. 

    Even knowing it has multiple viewpoints, I wasn't able to break through the wall that is Blake's Mary Sue character.

    Maybe it's because I work in tech and I've worked with (mostly against) people who act similarly enough to his opening chapter that it totally soured me on the story.

    >!The entire fight scene felt like one unreasonable dues ex machina after another. Finding the cave which solves all his immediate and future problems, using his special unique snowflake senses... It was too much too fast. !<
    ```

    - u/Dragongeek:
      ```
      If you think Blake is a Mary Sue character, then you haven't read that much at all of the story. His existence is literally suffering.
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        Maybe, >!I got to the part where he built in iron man suit in a cave out of random crystals he pulled out of the ground!<. In my opinion that's not really suffering.

        It's easy to just have a character "suffer" but if their character building and interactions with the world don't change as a result - it's not actually meaningful or impactful.

        >!Having his arm cut off could have had an impact... if he didn't immediately build a fully articulate replacement prosthetic by pulling a crystal out of the ground!<.
        ```

        - u/Dragongeek:

          >!His entire character is about how he's essentially a mechanics savant but completely inept at everything else, especially  social stuff and how his descent into madness through social isolation and paraplegia drives him into creating a dystopian dictatorial technocratic nightmare nation and commiting all sorts of other moral compromises.!<

          >!Yes, he can whip up robots and technology like nobody's business, but the tragic irony is that none of those inventions actually solve the big problems he faces.!<

            Hey there, author here!  u/HeatedSpoon, you should listen to u/Dragongeek.  Judging by their comments, they are clearly both wise and insightful, and I can only assume they are virtuous and loved by all as well.

            But in all seriousness, you may be surprised that I actually agree with you in a lot of ways.  Chapters 1-5 were the first chapters of fiction I had ever written and it shows.  I made a lot of mistakes.

            One of the biggest is that the first five chapters, in my mind, really functioned as a sort of prologue or prelude to the rest of the story.  More than anything, this gave me a strong urge to rush things so I could "get to the good stuff" and led to some seriously contrived plot developments.  I grew out of that quickly and the urge left once I got through Chapter 5, but still, the damage was done.  It was, as you say, too much too fast.

            There's also stuff I just wasn't very good at executing back then.  There's a reason that Blake's missing arm doesn't bother him as much as it should, but I don't really give that enough attention.  The general initial plot could be more varied and interesting, and he could start to figure out his powers earlier, giving me a longer stretch of time for him to work out everything, instead of it being all at once.

            I plan on going back to rewrite much of the early story now that I'm 4 years more experienced and I have a better grasp of who the characters are.  The problem is that I'm a terribly slow writer and it's going to take me another 3-5 years to finish at the rate I'm going.  If I start rewriting now, I'm going to fall into that hole and the story won't progress for at least a year or two as I end up rewriting chapter after chapter.  But at the same time, seeing some of the comments here about the opening turning people off just strengthens the ever-present urge to go back and fix everything immediately.  First impressions are important, after all.  But no!  I must stay strong.

            I guess this is just a longwinded way of saying "I know it's bad, but give it a chance and it gets better".  Somebody on my discord pointed out this thread and for some reason I felt compelled to respond.  Because you're right in some ways, but only for the small part you read.  If that makes sense.

            Also...

            >Maybe it's because I work in tech and I've worked with (mostly against) people who act similarly enough to his opening chapter that it totally soured me on the story.

            I also work in tech, and Blake is based off of several people I have had the "pleasure" of knowing.  He's not really somebody that is supposed to be liked, especially at the start.
            ```

            - u/Audere_of_the_Grey:
              ```
              I just started reading and also dropped the story for now because of the frustration of reading Blake.

              He's not at all a Mary Sue. However, his flaw reads less as a realistic flaw and more as *having literally zero theory of mind.* Like, you know that psychological test where a child is shown a piece of candy being taken from a candy box and placed under a basket, and then another person walks in, and then the child is asked where they think the new person will look for the candy? Blake seems utterly incapable of taking half a second to imagine how another person will react to his words or actions.

              Now, there *are* real people who are like this, but it's usually wrapped up in a lot more complex and explicit rationalization. And they aren't people who you can expect a reader to empathize with. Alternatively, they're on the autism spectrum, and if high-functioning (to the point of being employed) have developed ways of coping with their deficiencies which don't involve immediately demanding to talk to the highest authority in a foreign environment they know nothing about.

              There are characters in fiction who are assholes, who readers nevertheless enjoy reading about. Blake does not seem like that. Blake is more on the level of Umbridge, if Umbridge was a main character and also monumentally stupid. What did Blake expect to hear, when he said that the living conditions of the town suck and he had ideas to improve them? "Our suggestion box is right this way! We review the contents every morning and vote on them as a town!" "Gee, you've clearly demonstrated your expertise by walking in here and telling me you have ideas, so I'll get to work on implementing whatever you suggest right now!"

              How did he expect the townsfolk who have clearly demonstrated themselves to be religious fanatics to respond when he yelled that their book was wrong? "Oh, now that you mention it, I guess it doesn't make sense!" "We respect your position, and will consider it seriously!"

              The thing is, there are people who are super good at engineering but terrible with people... but Blake just reads like a caricature. Contrary to popular belief, intelligence in one area correlates *positively* with intelligence in other areas. His social deficiencies read less like social deficiencies and more like being transformed into a literal four-year-old.

              Frankly, it gave me the impression that you took the trope of "genius nerd who sucks at people," thought it made for a compelling character, and played it completely straight.
              ```

              - u/None:
                ```
                I think your post does a much better job of describing what I was trying to express. I will give this story another shot, if only because the literal author chiming in makes me feel a bit guilty about dropping it so soon.

                I think I first read Displaced about two years ago, but reading your description of his interactions with the townspeople brings it all back. His acting like a particularly dim anime isekai protagonist clashes with his intended characterization, if for no other reason than eventually even socially stunted people learn basic cause and effect.

  I'm looking for some military space sci-fi/space opera similar to:

  * Interdependency series
  * Expeditionary Force series

    The Hyperion Cantos by Dan Simmons might fit the bill, depending how military-focused you want your reading to be.
    ```

  - u/GlueBoy:
    ```
    * Vorkosigan Saga is great, and oft recommended here. Definitely a space opera, only occasionally delves into military stuff though. 

    * Starship Troopers is a classic that still holds up. Pioneered the concept of power armor/exoskeleton, I believe. 

    * Armor is a story inspired by Starship Troopers above. It delves more deeply into the power armor conceit. 

    * Forever War is another classic story with power armor that holds up. The "sequel" Forever Peace is also pretty good. 

    -1 on Lost Fleet that someone else recced. Tropey, formulaic mess, I hated it.

    - u/WalterTFD:
      ```
      Armor is some old school stuff, haven't seen that recc'd in forever.
      ```

  - u/netstack_:
    ```
    Bujold's Vorkosigan novels are an obvious option. I'd recommend *Shards of Honor* as a starting point. It's older but is definitely military focused.

    *Revelation Space* has an Expanse-adjacent aesthetic, but with lots of institutional knowledge lost due to the crippling of certain forms of technology. The first book isn't following soldiers, but deals with a lot of related themes like exotic weapons, interplanetary power balances, and posthuman combat.

    It's been a while since I read it, but Peter Hamilton's *Fallen Dragon* was a quality dude-becomes-space-marine book with a good setting.

    And to round things out, *[The Last Angel](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-last-angel.244209/)* is about a revenant human capital ship carrying on a guerilla war in a universe where humanity has been subjugated by the not!Covenant. I thought it had a great aesthetic and might be exactly what you're looking for.
    ```

    - u/Dragongeek:
      ```
      *The Last Angel* is fantastic. It really gives me the HFY-goosebumps at times, and its a prime example of one of my favorite subgenres (Human-made AI avenges/functions long after humanity is gone).

    [Grand Design](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21216/grand-design) is set after a cataclysmic event wiped out all humans across the galaxy, as new races have slowly started settling Humanity's old space stations. It follows two of humanity's last soldiers (gynoids) as they investigate a clue about what happened on that day 600 years ago.
    ```

  - u/gramineous:
    ```
    Its... maybe a decade since I've read it at this point, I was familiar with the author from his young adult work at the time, but I enjoyed reading The Risen Empire (and its sequel, although I just read the reprinted version that has them both printed together under the name of the first). My nemory is particularly fuzzy, but it was towards the harder end of the sci-fi spectrum. For example, FTL travel is impossible, so soldiers have to contend with the effects of relativity at the speeds they travel leave them decades out of sync with the people they grew up with, those in power cryogenically freeze themselves for decades between sessions and experience the same disconnect, the morality and politics of immortality is a major plot point, there's an AI spawned from an entire planet's interconnected networks.

    Probably the scene that I most remember (besides the really unnerving torture method scene) is the one were a fairly notable and successful soldier (and the point of view character at the time) is part of a an ambush against semi-superhuman enemies, but he reached his position with his unusual and significant physical prowess being considered too important by those directly above him to get rid off him, despite his low intelligence and understanding far below where a soldier should be, so he bungles the ambush by choosing the wrong setting on his rifle as he didn't understand the projectile fired would be slower than the speed of sound from the action, alerting the target of the ambush before it is hit.

    So yeah, worldbuilding points that fit with the crowd here, but its so long ago I don't know if the plot is actually rational at all.

  Saw [Man Off the Moon](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12904733/1/Man-off-the-Moon) recommended last week, and as I enjoy both Fate and Mass Effect, I decided to dive right in despite the length (over 700k words) and warning of slow updates.

  Quick summary: *This is a Fate x Mass Effect cross-over, where Heroic Spirit Emiya (aka Nameless, aka Archer) is summoned to run an errand for the Moon Cell in the Mass Effect universe, circa CE 2172 (about a decade before ME1). He ends up getting sent into the body of a boy, and decides to enlist with the Systems Alliance navy where he meets another new recruit, Jane Shepard.*

  Four days later and I'm caught up (mostly; at chapter 39/41 at the moment) and REALLY want to replay Mass Effect. Also wishing I could get my hands on Fate/Hollow Ataraxia, since I am used to Fate:Stay Night's Emiya (and to a lesser extent, his cameos in FGO), and there were references to events and characters that went over my head. The setting is entirely Mass Effect, while the Fate part has to do with Emiya and his powers; I wouldn't say that you need to know Fate to enjoy it, but you definitely get more out of it and Emiya seems a little less Marty Stu when you understand how magi, codecasting, and heroic spirits work. I would say that you need to know Mass Effect, however. Knowing context as well as the alien races really helps set the scene after the setting gets into space.

  I disliked how inconsistent Emiya's character can be, though there's usually some internal monologue that explains why he's acting as he does; he goes from caring too much, to caring too little, to having a food fight, to walking away from everything, almost chapter-to-chapter. He's also pretty much a Marty Stu, though his character in Fate can be that way too - he gets to use other Servants' Noble Phantasms as his own, and finds that his Trace/Projection ability effectively gives him super hacking skills (!) and the ability to halt time while inside electronics (!!). He gets an upgrade later that allows him to effectively be his own omnitool, so... yeah. At any given time, he can learn everything about everyone or jump out of his body into his "superhero ghost" form. And as a result of him being the protagonist, Shepard is very much a side character who gets shelved for much of the first half of the story, which is a shame.

  That being said, the setting is a great throw back into the ME universe, and the interaction Emiya has with ME characters hits my nostalgia meter hard. Getting to see how he deals not just with main characters like Shepard, Miranda, and Liara, but with secondary characters or antagonists like Nihlus, Saren, and Benezia, is a delight (and already throws the canon into havoc, as later characters >!like Tela Vasir!< get offed much earlier than in the games). I'm really interested in seeing where things go from here, as there's the possibility of working with Saren and Benezia before they are fully Indoctrinated to prepare the universe for the Reapers about 5 years prior to the events of the ME videogames.

  But again, the most prominent effect of reading the series is that I REALLY want to play the games again! No need for the Legendary Edition at least, since I have them all on my computer :-)

  Edit: If it wasn't clear, I am enjoying the story quite a bit. I'd recommend the work, but only if you like the two properties (Fate and Mass Effect). It's not something like "Maybe I'm a Lion?" where you don't need to know the IPs to enjoy the story. Also be aware that it's already about the length of the Bible, so expect it to take some time/effort to get through.
  ```

  - u/ThePhrastusBombastus:
    ```
    I found this story frustrating, because I was really enjoying it for the first quarter-million words or so. It wasn't a masterpiece or anything, but it was quite entertaining watching Emiya muck around in the Mass Effect setting with literal magic, and the writing quality and characterization were perfectly decent. Sometimes, they were even great! There was some legitimately creative plotting at times!

    (some spoilers ahead)

    And then it happened.  The *fucking* escape Thessia arc.  The arc that just would not freaking end.  It wasn't even bad at first! Emiya got tracked down by the citadel council, and he had to outwit a Specter or two to get away.  And that was fine, because we could have fun watching Emiya have an exciting action sequence, and then get back to the plot!  You know, the plot where he would use the information he spent the previous arc collecting to locate a missing person, who had been built up as being important...

    I thought I could see the shape of the arc to escape the planet. I thought I saw where the author was going.  And then at the arc's end... it didn't stop.  No, the arc just *kept on going*. New plot threads were introduced! Characters that could've easily stayed offscreen, reappeared. New plot elements were shoved in out of freaking nowhere! (Why did sportsgirl have to be a vampire all of a sudden? I DON'T FREAKING KNOW)

    And the arc just. Wouldn't. Fucking. End.

    In total, it was around 159k words long.  That's the length of multiple novels!  There was a logical stopping point at 48k words that would've worked perfectly to wrap up the arc. It was utterly maddening, and past a certain point all I wanted was for the arc to just *end*, so we could get back to hunting down the rest of the pirates from the last arc, or whatever.

    So yeah. That was my experience with the story.  Enjoyable, but then the author forgot what goddamn pacing was, and I got sick of it. And for me, it was tragic, because there was something legitimately good there, but I couldn't bring myself to enjoy it any further.
    ```

    - u/AurelianoTampa:
      ```
      I just wanted to say, this rant was absolutely amazing and I 100% agree. Thessia took foreverrrrrr. I am wondering if the various characters who showed up are going to be relevant going forward or if they are more-or-less just little nods to ME fans. I feel like Sportsgirl in particular is probably going to show up again at some point, but yeah, right now she feels pretty superfluous. Same with Liara's "father," and even the museum professor (who I liked as a character) ended up not really being necessary for the plot. The Cerberus agents also didn't have much of a role to play, especially Kai Leng, but I felt like they were there more as an introduction than anything else. 

      That all being said, the end of the arc was pretty awesome. It just could have happened a lot sooner.
      ```

  - u/xachariah:
    ```
    How much Fate do I need to know for this story?  

    I've seen a couple Fate stories that start out fairly reasonable.  Like, 'okay, this guy can stab a lance really ridiculously well and can use magic'.  But then suddenly he's got some other dozen different abilities I'm suddenly expected to know (or worse, suddenly a dozen new characters).
    ```

    - u/AurelianoTampa:
      ```
      The Fate stuff is contained mostly to Emiya's character and abilities; there is some plot involving the Moon Cell, especially at the beginning, but the only other Fate character who shows up is Archimedes, from Extella, and he's mostly just an excuse to get the plot started.

      It does help to know more about Emiya, especially his life after the Fate/Stay Night stuff where he effectively becomes a terrorist in his pursuit of being a "hero of justice." And understanding his heroic spirit's powers, especially his Unlimited Blade Works, Trace, Projection, and Reinforcement, give you a better idea of his powers. But as said, he's pretty much a Marty Stu; he'll keep pulling out new and more ridiculous stuff, which while based on his abilities, really feels like he has no true upper limit to using his skills. A quick overview of each (some slight spoilers):

      * Projection becomes overpowered enough that he can basically will almost anything into reality, like perfect eezo, not just weapons as he does in the Fate series. 

      * Reinforcement let's him effectively act almost as strong as his Servant self while he's still in a human body. He can also survive a lot of damage and heal himself, though it costs him (in an ill-defined way).

      * UBW gives him instant access to a pocket dimension and to almost any Noble Phantasm he's seen, and he can also summon defective versions of them to use as bombs. 

      * And as mentioned before, his Trace and Projection abilities let him hack everything seemingly without effort, and if he enters electronics in Servant form, he slows or stops time while inside.

      * I guess it's worth mentioning too that when he leaves his body for his Servant form, he can "astralize," causing him to be untouchable and invisible and able to phase through walls and floors at will. Interestingly, biotics DO still affect him while astralized. His body restores his magical energy, so he needs to return every so often to replenish his power, but his class (Archer) has an innate skill called Independent Action which extends this time limit much further than other classes. At the start of the story he can basically go a full day without needing to go back to his body and recharge.

      That's basically his move set, and he develops it over time, not all at once, but you can see why I feel he's a Marty Stu.
      ```

      - u/None:

        He can already project permanent objects at the start of the Fate series. The magical weapons came later, not the other way around.

  I'm not sure how self-promos are received here, but I thought I'd drop a link to my story here just to test the waters. It's a fantasy isekai, updates weekly, and the first arc has just wrapped up.

  [https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/40641/displacement](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/40641/displacement)

  I'd describe the main character's actions/decisions as "inquisitive" and "meticulous" more so than strictly "rationalist" (she is very much a flawed human being who does not always make the wisest decision on the spur of the moment), but that's a pretty fine hair to be splitting and I'll leave it to any interested readers to judge whether it belongs in this sub.

    Harry Potter and the Natural Twenty had an arc on this in the later chapters, but sadly it stopped midway and is no longer updating. The first 2/3 of the story has nothing to do with it but the last third is a perfect match. I’ve seen some other HP fanfic with this theme but nothing particularly great.

    AH HAH I FINALLY FOUND IT

    I knew I saw something that EXACTLY matched this description

    but I couldn't remember the name

    thankfully that 'search the entire subreddit tool' came out not long ago

    can you imagine some janky hacked together github project is better than reddit's search function

    anyway (h/t u/linuxguy64): 

    >BTW, this isn't rational fiction but I found a podcast/ARG related to Animorphs called "[Sporadic Phantoms](https://www.sporadicphantoms.com/home)" (it's an anagram). It's about three investigatory podcasters trying to figure out what The Sharing is...takes place in the modern day, and the three hosts do not have any idea anything about yeerks, andalites, morphing, etc, so it's all from an outsider's perspective. IT's very well made for something that I can't imagine more than like 60 people listen to.


    I remember reading the description and thinking 'hey that's cool' and then forgetting about it

    I havent listened to it yet but it is precisely what you are asking for
    ```

  - u/sprague-grundy:
    ```
    That's an incredibly specific description.  Are you thinking of some story in particular that you liked?

    I think the plot of The Order (a fun but mediocre TV show) matches that description pretty well.  It even has >!overcoming memory erasure!< as a major plot point.

      No, I have no particular story in mind; I just want something about uncovering a conspiracy, and everything else is just a bunch of ideas I think I'd like in a story like that (or at least which I would try to include if I wrote a story like that).

  If you are not monitoring trending on royalroad and can take "lewd descriptions and depraved sexualization", I got hooked today by this: [An Infinite Recursion of Time (~15 chapters as of this post)](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/43761/an-infinite-recursion-of-time)

  Its too early, but it got me thinking how WtC could have been, if less rational, more lighthearted, with more NSFW DM and enabled saves.

  Here is the annotation:

  >I always wanted to be taken to another world, and as they say, there are no atheists in the foxhole that we call real life. I prayed, and prayed, and prayed until one day, I opened my eyes to see my dream had come true.

  >A time-loop fantasy story written after getting into litRPGs a bit. I wondered what it would be like if I just went and wrote a story about all the things I liked in web fiction without holding back: time loops, RPG stats, certain character archetypes, and harems played straight. Please be warned of lewd descriptions and depraved sexualization. If nothing else, this will be a sincere work.

  I’ve recently started [Wander West, in Shadow](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/39018/wander-west-in-shadow) (formerly The Glimmerling) which is a slow paced fantasy story about a young traveling wizard and witch. It has excellent worldbuilding, horror and mystery. For more plot info, the first chapter is a short synopsis by the author without spoiling much.

  Though the grammar and style are flawless, the author considers the story a first draft, so I’m happy to look over some weaker scenes (I found the ending of the second arc a bit too lucky >!Martim’s plan of using the mob to kill the bogge-rider worked flawlessly and in the end everybody is smiling at each other!<).

  I'm curious if anyone knows any Fanfiction of Manga/Anime that use the original material to construct it? The most obvious example is Abridged versions of anime (Hellsing, Yugioh, Fate/Zero) which are somewhat prevalent on YouTube.  
  Manga seems like it would be easier to achieve though, and would allow easier editing of scenes (since it is a far easier medium to cut bits out and rearrange them). There are mangas which are fanfiction (essentially), but they are redrawn.
  Though, I do imagine the reasons that this is nowhere near as common is due to two aspects: Being more challenging (but easier than drawing things yourself); and of being of more dubious legality (though, Abridged series already upload only lightly edited episodes with different audio).
  ```

  - u/sunshine_cata:
    ```
    I would imagine that the complex paneling of manga makes it harder to edit than film. You would have to use whole pages, and that would cause discontinuities.

    There are some where they really skimp on backgrounds and it's just talking heads where it might be possible.

  First off: a meta rec. I love to see fanfiction that are respectful, realistic takes on lighthearted universes. Stories that take the original characters of the work and endow them with mature emotions and themes and adventures, without trivializing the original work or substituting the light of the original work for pointless darkness, and without fundamentally altering the characters involved. So while I can't recommend My Little Pony: Friendship is magic *per se*, because it is indeed a children's cartoon in the strictest and most limited sense, I *would* recommend getting to know enough about the original work to start reading fanfiction, because MLP is quite possibly the quintessential playground for fanfiction authors. (And in particular, fimfiction.net is easily the best laid-out fanfiction website I've ever seen.)

  Normally if I recommend pony stuff here it's because it's the kind of story I would expect even non-pony-fans would enjoy. These stories aren't those stories-- they won't be enjoyable to people without knowledge of the source material, like say [Friendship is Optimal](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/62074/friendship-is-optimal) or [Hard Reset](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/67362/hard-reset) might be. These are stories that play directly into fanfiction's strongest point-- telling stories that rely on and benefit from the conventions of the source material to tell a story that can play with the reader's expectations and feelings about the characters and settings of the source material.

  Also, if anyone has any recs in line with what I talked about in paragraph one, please post them!

  * A series of stories set in a broadly 'canon compliant' world over a significant span of time, but dealing with themes of loss, regret, self-hatred, rebellion, redemption, and immortality. The stories are a lot more connected than you'd expect from reading their summaries.

  If anyone’s looking for a new rational Pokémon fan fiction, I’d like to direct your attention to [Borne of Caution](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/36950/borne-of-caution). 

  Basic premise is a lion keeper gets dropped into the world of Pokémon with a telepathic Vulpix after the US is nuked to hell and back. He’s a logical, cautious sort of person, with a degree in zoology and experience working with big cats, and he’s just been dropped into a whole new world of weird, whacky animal physiology. A fair amount of the novel is given over to comparative physiology, tangents regarding diet and physical therapy for Pokémon, and animal behavior. 

  This one is definitely not as hardcore ratfic as Origin of Species, but it’s a good read if you’re looking for something fun with a rational take on the care and keeping of Pokémon.
  ```

  - u/NTaya:
    ```
    I began reading it, but got put off by the telepathic Vulpix. I came into the story expecting precisely what you said—a dive into whacky animal physiology. I did not expect them to be sentient. That feels rather, uh, contradictory to the premise in a sense?

    (I did like the nuclear-holocaust-kun taking place of the truck-kun. The resulting trauma felt well explored.)
    ```

    - u/cloudymcloudface:
      ```
      Understandable. I did point out that it’s not as hardcore rational as Origin of Species. That being said, I don’t think that the sentience takes away from the story, in particular since it’s a big part of the original work. It’s a rational approach in an irrational world, I suppose. Although of course everyone in the world thinks it’s perfectly rational that Pokémon are sentient lol
      ```

  - u/burnerpower:
    ```
    Ah I tried that one briefly but was extremely put off by the first chapter. I could believe it will be good but opening with a random nuclear holocaust isekai... Well I'm not sure what the point was or why the author thought this was a good idea, but I took it as a giant red flag to stay away.
    ```

    - u/Darkpiplumon:
      ```
      Why was it a red flag for you? I took it as a new and interesting way to be truck-kuned.
      The MC is also affected by this, not being something that happens and is immediately forgotten.
      ```

      - u/burnerpower:
        ```
        Truck-kun is pretty played out at this point, but it's a trope for a reason. It quickly and easily gives some establishing facts about the main character while moving them promptly into the actual story without wasting too much time.

        The nuclear apocalypse has none of these benefits. It's not quickly told. It doesn't tell us anything about the protagonist's character besides the fact that he's traumatized from burning to death and experiencing the death of humanity. It's a huge amount of emotional baggage to dump on the first chapter of a pokemon isekai of all things. New and interesting does not mean good.

        I guess the best way too put it is that it's incredibly tonally dissonant. Unless the author was priming the reader to expect the Pokemon world to be a dark and grim place, which is atleast not the first impression the reader is given. I also just don't find the idea of the main character having to work through their trauma from dying in a nuclear apocalypse that compelling.
        ```

    - u/cloudymcloudface:
      ```
      Fair enough. Although I will say that the novel treats the MC’s resulting trauma and loss with a sense of realism, so if you can move past the manner of death, you’ll find a surprisingly thoughtful isekai.

  What are peoples' thoughts on the red ~~riding~~ rising trilogy? I liked the plots within plots and the level 2 intelligent plays. I wouldn't say it's rational, but I found it acceptable, my main gripe being a couple of too-accurate predictions. I enjoyed it a lot.

  I think another thing to mention is that the first book is considered meh, and the second and third are considered amazing.

  - u/GlueBoy:

    I liked it until I figured out the structure(constant cycle of escalating one-upsmanship), and then it got old fast. It basically becomes a mexican soap opera version of [this scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyOAxh4Iybg) from rick and morty.

    >red riding trilogy

    I'm confused, Red Rising or Riding? Rising is the scifi with castes, riding seems to be a murder mystery from the cover..

    &#x200B;

    As far as Red Rising goes, I didn't get much past the first chapter, but it's still on my tbr. I was coming out of dropping Eragon because it was boring me, and the start felt very similar. 

    &#x200B;

    From what I heard book 1 is a bit subpar, as far as female characters go. But book 2 and 3 are much better and quite good fiction.

  I only noticed the post disparaging  Friendship is Optimal yesterday so my comment recommending one of its recursive fanfic is doomed to go unseen, so I'm reposting here with a longer intro:

  ----

  Friendship is Optimal is a my little pony fanfiction setting that, to me, is about AI safety and the philosophy behind that. Think of Metamorphisis of Prime Intellect but with ponies instead of freaky sex and torture. 

  I know, you are saying to yourself, "I don't like ponies! I can't get past this!" - that's part of the point. The ponies are the paperclips and the AI is maximising them. Part of the horror/dread for many readers is that the world is turning into PONIES and that is HORRIBLE. (Flipside, of course, is that plenty of bronies are like "wow this is so cool i wish it was real" - I vaccillate from one to the other personally). 

  Maybe now you're saying to yourself, "okay, I'll give it a shot, but I don't know anything about ponies and I assume without knowing Strawberry Sparklehoof's life story I will be hopelessly lost!". Unless you delve into the recursive fanfic quite deeply, all you need to know is that My Little Pony is a TV show/toy brand that little girls and some adult men really enjoy(ed). Some characters appear, but they are *as fictional characters*. You might be lost for a second here or there (they talk about Fluttershy's Cutie Mark - what is a fluttershy and what is a cutie mark? - but it is irrelevant to the plot completely). 

  Now maybe you're saying "well, I read the review, and the OP said Friendship is Optimal is written only OK but not great! I am not wasting my time on that". 

  You don't have to. There's recursive fanfic, particularly three by the author Chatoyance that I'll recommend here, that  are well written and completely overshadow the original. Chatoyance appears to be, if not part of the rationalist community, very familiar with the "themes", so to speak.

  So, I want to second the other thread's strong recomendation for "Friendship is Optimal: Caelem Est Conterrens (Heaven is Terrifying)". If you had to read either FiO or CEC, it's EASILY CEC that is the most interesting and best-written story. 

  I delved into the recursive fanfic a few years ago and most of it is bad, some of it is OK, and a rare few are fantastic. Some talk about philosophy and AI safety and what it means to be human and some talk about how cool it would be if you had your mind uploaded because then you could be a pony, or how cool it would be if you had your mind uploaded because then you could murder people. 

  (Aside: there's another recursive fanfic that I recommend if you want to see a diverse range of peoples' AI upload utopias, including some that are very much weirdtopia. It's called [All The Myriad Worlds](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/137717/friendship-is-optimal-all-the-myriad-worlds) and is made of about ten 1,000 word flashes. This requires you to understand the friendship is optimal setting, though, so don't read it as a one-off unless you are happy to not be quite sure what's happening)

  Caelem Est Conterrens (CEC) is about AI safety (not *quite* as much as the original, as the original is from the angle of vision of the AI's designer) but one of the main themes for me was identity. It was written in a beautiful, poignant way and pulled no punches as to the horror of some parts of it. 

  Chatoyance's two other optimalverse works (Implacable and Leftovers) are both great but less about AI safety. 

  Implacable is how you would munchkin a base that would prevent the AI from catching you (has an excellent ending), and Leftovers is about a bunch of people who were cryonically frozen being offered the option to upload themselves to ponies even though the AI doesn't technically count them as human.

  Caelem Est Conterrens (54k words): https://www.fimfiction.net/story/69770/friendship-is-optimal-caelum-est-conterrens

  Implacable (16k words): https://www.fimfiction.net/story/406526/implacable

  Leftovers (10k words): https://www.fimfiction.net/story/386867/leftovers-a-friendship-is-optimal-story

  In general, if you are only going to give this author/setting one chance, read CEC as it's the best, unless the synopsis I provided of one of the other two really grabs you. Otherwise I rank them in the order listed above for overall quality. 

  Some more rankings:

  AI-safety-stuff: CEC > I > L

  Pony concentration: (most ponies) CEC > L >= I (least ponies) [all contain ponies]

  Philosophy/makes-you-think: CEC > L > I

  Action: I > CEC > L

  Accessibility to someone without FiO (and/or Rationality) background knowledge: CEC > I > L
  ```

  - u/GaBeRockKing:
    ```
    > Chatoyance 

    It's always hard for me to read chatoyance stuff because she's kind of a nut, but she's certainly made some interesting stuff. Funny that we both independently decided to spam ponyfic at the recommendation thread today lol.
    ```

    - u/MagicWeasel:
      ```
      is it independent if FiO was mentioned in a top level post since the last recc thread?

      What's the Chatoyance goss? I love the glimpses from her author's notes so what's the rest? I have not read her non-optimalverse work.

      (And I notice she's published something with GPT2 cowriting it in FiO universe so I'm looking forward to having a chance to read that eventually)
      ```

      - u/GaBeRockKing:
        ```
        > What's the Chatoyance goss? ... I have not read her non-optimalverse work.

        That would explain it-- I almost exclusively read (e as is dead, not deed) her TCB stuff. tl;dr, she's kind of infamous for being a misanthrope. She acquired a substantial hatedom back in the day for being relentlessly anti-human. She might have lightened up-- I wouldn't know, since I haven't looked at her stuff in so long, but there's a reason all her ratings are disabled.

        Side note: I've never actually read FiO (and don't intend to) because I find the premise too existentially horrifying.
        ```

        - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
          ```
          >  I find the premise too existentially horrifying

          Sounds like someone has the grumps-grumps and needs a healthy dose of friendship and ponies.

          > I find the premise too existentially horrifying.

          If you ever feel like waxing lyrical at length on this please indulge me :)

          > she's kind of infamous for being a misanthrope

          Oh, I definitely got that impression! But I kind of liked it. Then again, I know the conversion bureau centers on human/pony differences, so maybe that would get a bit soapboxy.
          ```
