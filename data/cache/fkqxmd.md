## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding and Writing Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*
* Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is *also* the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday Recommendation thead)

  Cross-posted from [this /r/magicbuilding thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicbuilding/comments/fk7yis/magic_of_the_week_magical_seas/fks2jri/).

  I like the ideas of seas being different, each possessed of their own unique magic. There's magic in water, and if you get enough of that water in one place, it's going to take on a character of its own, one shaped by the conditions around it.

  The Benumbed Sea grows colder the deeper you go, and glaciers break off from the Gelid Depths sometimes, breaking through the surface of the water like enormous, frigid whales, one of the primary hazards for ships that make their way across the waters that are beat down on by a baking-hot sun. They say that the bottom of the Benumbed Sea is coated with ice a mile thick, and that whole civilizations live down there, unaware that there's anything above the ice and water.

  The land beneath the Morphic Sea rarely settles for long, undulating and occasionally rising above the surface, sometimes revealing ruins or treasures, other times underwater communities that grumble about their brief periods of island living before being pulled down into the depths once more. Charting the Morphic is a hazard, and ships always pack extra food, for fear that they'll be lifted up and stranded for a week or two, a not-uncommon occurrence.

  Everything moves faster in the wide Breaker Sea, and when a ship catches a good wind, it will soon find itself going incredible speeds, so fast that an ill-prepared ship will be torn apart by the slap of the waves against the hull. The biggest problem for ships isn't getting from one place to another as fast as possible, but slowing down enough that they aren't broken into pieces by their speed, and being able to stop once they're near their destination. A cutter on the Breaker Sea spends half its time speeding up and half its time slowing down.

  The Vivium Sea is teeming with life, all of it unfortunately bony and inedible. What's said to be most striking about sailing it is the sound of the fish and eels constantly slapping up against the hull, and the way the sailing goes slower from the friction of all that life hitting the ship. There are enormous monsters in the Vivium, to be sure but they're rare, and far out-numbered by the smaller ones. It's said that a long dip in the Vivium will remove a man's need to eat for a full day, but only the desperate would try it, given what lives there. (I do like the idea of the fauna being used for other purposes, more in the sense of byproducts, their inedibility a quirk rather than a real limiting factor for exploitation.)

  By contrast, the Sea of Glass is perfectly still, unmoved by winds or tides, and as near as anyone can tell, completely lifeless. It's the only of the Seventeen Seas that's completely lifeless, and it's the most difficult of them to sail, which can only be done with a special craft that skids along the surface, as any boat with a hull will find itself deprived of its speed.

    seems well suited to water magic being tied to emotions.  Maybe \*all\* water magic isn't depression?  It may depend on the individual, and the water they are sensing/manipulating.

  This isn't a problem, but I'd still like to hear what /r/rational makes of it.

  In my world there are some things that work differently than in reality. Magic is real, and there are a lot of cases where even simple real world physics and biology are completely set aside in favour of magical explanations. There is still internally consistent logic, though it's not always obvious. And I wonder what you guys make of this:

  In my world, heterochromia (Having eyes of different colour) is severely stigmatized, and often seen as deeply sinister. Old legends and religious texts often portray villains as having 'witch's eyes', and even the few good characters with such eyes are always morally gray tricksters or reformed villains. Odysseus level sneaky bastards who help out their friends but screw over everyone else is about the best you can hope for. If you were putting on a play where it's obvious from the start who the baddie is, the baddie probably has heterochromia.

  Babies born with such eyes are sometimes killed, and usually their birth is enough to make their families social outcasts overnight, or at least get the rumor mill going. The 'scholarly' explanation is that, being born EVIL, there is something in their soul that is disharmonious and causes birthmarks, witch's eyes etc.

  The *actual* explanation is a little less sinister, but still unfair to the child. Reproduction in my world is a union of bodies, but it is also a union of souls. And if there is deception between the parents, that does affect the soul of the child. Such deceptions can vary - if one of the parents seduces the other to get ahead in life but doesn't have any romantic feelings themselves, you may get a child with witch's eyes. If it's a political marriage or drunken one night stand and both parents understand it, no deception and no witch's eyes. But if one parent's view of the other clashes significantly with reality or one is keeping an important secret, the child suffers. Even something as innocent as "I was a nobleman in the capital, but I hated serving the evil king so I disappeared and started a new life as an innkeeper and never told my wife" could be enough.

  Now, there's still an element of self fulfilling prophecy there. On the one hand, a child treated cruelly and with suspicion by everyone they meet *is* going to be a lot more likely to grow up to be maladjusted, learn to manipulate people, make an effort to seem nice and harmless regardless of their actual feelings etc. And on the other hand, they also have parents who are not having a healthy relationship - and their birth provides evidence of that which will likely cause a lot of tension and drama even if nothing was visible on the surface before. And if the deception is something like one of the parents being a sociopath or narcissist pretending to be normal, again that doesn't bode well for the mental health of the child, because one of their parents sucks.

  While I have the details worked out in my head, I don't think it will be explicitly explained in my actual story. The readers should be able to fill in the blanks and get it mostly right, and even if they don't it's just an unimportant detail about the world. One of the main characters has witch's eyes, but she's conveniently chaotic evil anyway.

  # Writing Rational Dragons

  Hi! I’m working on a fantasy setting that includes a civilization of Dragon Riders.

  I’d like to try to build the most rational-seeming dragons possible that still fulfill the role of “massive deadly fire-breathing flying mounts.” They should conform to many traditional dragon tropes, but I’d like to find justifications for these behaviors.

  Here are my notes on Dragon biology and behavior so far.

  *Dragon Biology:*

  Dragons are feathered, with four limbs: two powerful rear legs, and two wings with hooked claws at the joints.  I want to avoid the strange 6-limb anatomy, and as we’ve learned that more and more dinosaurs were feathered, this seems appropriate for a flying creature.

  They breathe fire using internal gas sacs and sparking glands in the throat.  Their feathers are slick and flame resistant, coated in a fireproof oil that gives them a rainbow sheen in sunlight.

  The gas sacs also serve to provide some buoyancy for lighter than air flight despite their massive size.  The gas is created by a chemical reaction in their stomach between the acid and something like Limestone.

  Dragons typically live in craggy, mountainous regions, clinging with their forelimbs to cliff faces, and using super-hot fire and powerful rear legs to burrow into soft parts of the rock and make Creche caves.

  Their tunnels will follow weaknesses in the rock, and they have a knack for finding veins of metal which they can melt with their flame to create soft spots and gaps in which to dig.  Their burrows will often trace these veins to a mother-lode of softer precious metals, which they will melt down to form smooth, round dens in which to lay their eggs.

  Behaviorally, they are pack hunters with a strict social hierarchy (essential for any tameable species.)  Social clusters are led by a Brood Mother, an alpha female that rules over a group of breeding males.  As dragons are long-lived, the dominant female is typically ancient and large, and capable of producing several eggs when she goes into heat.  Each of these will be laid with a different male for fertilization and safekeeping, with mates selected based on their hierarchical position and quality of their Creche burrows.  These eggs can take years to gestate, requiring constant attention and warming from their paternal caretakers.

  Males, for their part, are divided into a hierarchy of Breeders and Hunters, based mostly on age and fighting prowess.  Males compete for position through ceremonial dominance contests, with the strongest taking possession of the most desirable burrows, typically those situated in rich Gold veins.  Usually these coveted positions are held by old, large male dragons, lifelong mates of the Alpha Brood Mother.

  Younger males form hunting parties, roving in packs to take down both small prey and megafauna, and carry the meat back to feed their elders. Those who perform well in the hunt earn favor within the pack, and can earn the rights to challenge others for low-tier breeding positions.

  The oldest males will eventually become sluggish and through pestering from younger upstarts be unseated from their breeding burrows.  These lifelong partners of the Brood Mother are allowed to join her in the heart of the mountain in retirement, warming her nest and defending it from intruders until they finally pass.

  Occasionally, inter-pack conflict will break out, usually in the form of a younger female challenging and ousting her elder.  Females are born with much less frequency, and are often killed or run out by their mother at maturity.  But occasionally one survives and grows, sometimes by taking on other roving young and low-status males without breeding rights.  These rogue packs will roam until they either find a suitable new breeding ground, or manage to unseat an existing matriarch.

  While it is rare, there have been recorded instances of an older male taking a paternal interest in his female offspring, and defending it from his partner brood mother.  The resulting conflict usually results in the death or ouster of the male from his breeding position, but can make survival of the young female more likely.

  The Dragon Rider society has shaped itself over the generations after the practices of their Dragon symbiotes.  They maintain a strict social hierarchy and have ritualized the hatching and bonding process for new dragons to maintain the monopoly of the elite warrior caste over them.  Bonding to a dragon is a symbol of power and prosperity, and bonded dragons are often passed down through noble families to maintain that status.

  I’m interested in any thoughts, brainstorming, or critiques to help rationalize Dragons and the setting!

    >Dragons are feathered ... and as we’ve learned that more and more dinosaurs were feathered, this seems appropriate for a flying creature.

    The feathers seem like an unnecessary deviation from typical dragon tropes. While it would make sense if they're genetic cousins of birds, that would make the fire breathing very hard to explain. Fire breathing is the most unusual part of dragons from an evolutionary perspective so I would start with explaining that before moving on. Instead of being related to birds, I suspect they would be most closely related to several species of small fire-breathing lizards, around the same size as geckos or iguanas, which use fire as a defense against large furry predators like bears, apes, and big cats.

    >They breathe fire using internal gas sacs and sparking glands in the throat. The gas sacs also serve to provide some buoyancy for lighter than air flight despite their massive size. The gas is created by a chemical reaction in their stomach between the acid and something like Limestone.

    This biologically-produced lifting gas you're talking about would be methane. It won't lift as much as you think, and it would make for a very poor weapon which would likely hurt the dragon more than its target. It would also be hard to explain any gradual evolution of some ignition mechanism since it would initially be so deadly to the dragon itself, even before it's learned to use the methane as a weapon. Instead of gas, I would suggest a liquid jet, much like the emission from a [bombardier beetle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombardier_beetle). This could evolve in an animal which starts off by spitting at predators, like a [spitting cobra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spitting_cobra), and then, with enough random mutation and natural selection, gradually evolves into an increasingly noxious and deadly cocktail until it's actually a hypergolic flammable mixture, like a mixture of hydrazine, hydrogen peroxide, and very oily sebum. This would be immensely effective against their furry predators, and allow the tiny lizards to quickly become a fairly dominant species.

    Most of these fire-lizard species would probably live in dense, tropical bamboo forests. I imagine these lizards would have to climb to hunt for their prey, but would live in fire-resistant burrows at ground level. Occasionally, their own fires would force them to jump down to reach their burrows, so natural selection would favor the ones that can survive falling from great heights. They'd start to become flatter and develop webbing between their forelimbs and bodies, much like the various [draco lizards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draco_\(genus\)). As a a side note, the occasional fires they create would create a symbiotic relationship with the bamboo, since the fires would wipe out all competing plant species and the bamboo would grow faster than any other plants can keep up with.

    During climactic warm periods, these lizards and their bamboo forests would spread poleward fairly easily. However, once global temperatures drop again, the lizards living furthest from the equator would start to have selective pressure for [gigantothermy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigantothermy), where the bigger lizards have less surface area for their body mass and thus tend to remain warmer and more functional in cool weather. This is when you'd start to see pterodactyl-sized fire-lizards becoming the predominant species.

    These larger fire-lizards would start to have trouble living in dense forests, so the ones which can fly would probably start inhabiting temperate plains. Indeed, they might even use their fire-breathing ability as a hunting tactic, setting a forest fire and then catching the creatures that go running away from it. This fire-setting behavior would tend to eliminate forests and replace them with plains where the hunting would be easier anyway.

    As the temperatures get colder still during the course of an ice age, the fire-lizards would face selective pressure to grow even bigger. By this point, these mammoth-sized flying fire-breathing lizards that live in burrows or cliff faces might be properly called dragons.

    >Dragons typically live in craggy, mountainous regions, clinging with their forelimbs to cliff faces, and using super-hot fire and powerful rear legs to burrow into soft parts of the rock and make Creche caves. Their tunnels will follow weaknesses in the rock, and they have a knack for finding veins of metal which they can melt with their flame to create soft spots and gaps in which to dig.

    Remember, any fire these dragons are making needs to be propelled out of their own bodies. If at all possible, it'd be better to have a low-temperature fire which is just hot enough to ignite fur and wood. Anything hot enough to melt rock is going to melt them too. Similarly, digging and burrowing into dirt or soft sandstone certainly seems reasonable, but hard rock and ore veins seems unlikely.

      thanks, lots of cool ideas here! I think you are right that I should think about the order of evolution.

      for the melting metals - I wanted to give a basis for the idea that dragons hoard wealth and gold.  The idea that they build their nests in soft metal veins seemed interesting to me as a naturalistic explanation for the trope.
      ```

  - u/TJ333:
    ```
    Do people make hot air balloons from dragon parts? Or use a smaller dragon as a fire source and the oil from its feathers to make a fireproof air bag?

    One area to explore would be the chemistry of the rocks that allow for dragon gas production and its possible other uses.
