## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  Once a day your body can clone itself through magical means. Only your own body can do it, your clones cannot clone themselves. Each cloned body has the same nutritional requirements as your own body, which can change depending on what diet plan and activity your clone body follows. All clones start off looking identical to you and having identical DNA. However, that can also change depending on diet, exercise, and injuries. Basically, your clones are real biological human bodies. The mass for them comes through magical means.

  Each clone is in a mental link with every other clone, and there is mutual trust between you and your clones. You cannot share everything through this mental links, but you can share thoughts, images, and videos (or whatever the mental equivalent is, memories?). The sharing is instantaneous, but it can take time to parse the information into useful understanding.

    Send them all to business school or seminary. Climb the corporate ladder while also climbing the religious hierarchy ladder. Become the Illuminati.

    I have a (slowly expanding) hivemind.

    With care, I can have members of my hivemind start taking on different studies, developing different expertises. (The education, accommodation and food costs will be the major limit on how fast I can expand my hivemind). This will lead to me quickly developing mentally-accessible experts in a variety of fields. Being able to put together techniques from disparate disciplines will help me to develop new... well, new just about anything. (If I knew what I could specifically develop, then I'd just develop it without bothering with the hivemind).

    Moreover, having clones who live in different places and never physically meet will help to ensure that no pandemic can easily stop me. (My main body, being the only one capable of generating new clones, will stay out of contact with everyone; one of the clones will deliver any necessary sanitised food supplies).

    My clones can take on skilled employment in various fields once their educations are complete (there will be some confusion regarding things like identity documents, but a half-dozen clones all turning up at once and claiming to be different people should resolve that) and thus become self-sustaining...

    I would openly reveal my cloning powers, then look for multiple different PostDoc/research positions in related fields, advertising my ability to share knowledge with myself as a strength that will let me integrate knowledge more broadly.  For example I think in neuroscience, neurobiology, and cognitive psychology there is enough data and theories and ideas across levels of description that no one person has put it all together into a comprehensive understanding.

  Chaos Magic Powers.  Inspired by Discord from MLP.  You can make almost “anything” happen but it always takes a chaotic twist, with bizarre side effects and misdirected primary effects. The more precisely you try to control your primary intended effect the more chaotic the side effects. Trying to undo the side effects tends to creates even more chaotic side effects, although with luck, practice, and skill you can occasionally get side effects to cancel out.  If you deliberately make the primary effect chaotic, you can make the side effects more manageable.  If you avoid repeating yourself this also make the side effects more manageable.

  For instance healing a missing arm:

  * if you try to directly replace the missing arm exactly how it was before it might dramatically mutate the person’s body elsewhere for instance turning a leg into a monkey leg.

  * if you just try to “replace” missing limb, it might give the person a lobster arm or monkey arm or tentacle.

  * if you try to regrow the arm, it might trigger weird growths all over the person body

  * if you are intentionally chaotic and try to grow/replace their arm with a monkey arm they might only grow monkey hair or have another limb made monkey like as side effects.

  * if you tried to heal multiple people in a row, your power would get more unruly and chaotic with each healing

  * on the other hand, if you only healed once every now and then with no particular pattern you might find the side effects easier to control.

  Creating persistent magical effects tends to result in persistent magical effects that oppose or subvert the intended effect.  For instance replacing an arm with a magically empowered monkey arm might summon into existence a magical monkey that steal people’s arms.

    Have a thousand different things that you want done, each wildly different from the others. Pick one, and do it the most egregiously Rube Goldberg way possible.

    Cause c'mon, you only need to make it rain carbon nanotubes once to put a dent in global warming.

    It's always easier to destroy something than to build something. And there are *so many* ways to destroy things... I could turn in into pudding, have it dismantled by bees, take a giant eraser and simply rub it out...

    So *destroying* things should be simple and straightforward. I could destroy a large swathe of seaborne plastic by turning it into fish; I could erase the hole in the ozone layer; I could turn nuclear bombs into cake. (I might even be able to restore someone's arm by erasing the injury that took it off in the first place...)

    *Creating* things can be a lot harder. But even there, there are options... I could try to pull fictional objects (or characters) out of books or stories. I could create new forms of life where I specify only one or two characteristics (like *smart* and *empathetic*) and let the rest all be random. The important thing is never to try to create the same thing twice, or in quick succession. And I'd need to create random, minor props on a very frequent basis, so as not to build up too much of a chaotic charge...
