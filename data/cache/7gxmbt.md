  So, odds that the [chapter 66 spoilers](#s "person the kid wanted her to meet is Norman? Might be too soon to reintroduce him, but this chapter gave us a clear reason why he could have survived.")

    My thoughts exactly. If it is him, I expect him to have a head start on the next step of the next puzzle and information about the farms that can help free the next batch. Although I doubt they will find Minerva in the next few chapters, if at all.

    I hope it isn't him. Because it would imply that the farmers and the poachers are working together, which would make the world of the monsters feel less interesting in my opinion.

    Or it's possible that he escapes on his own, but even that makes all the trouble they went through trying to escape seem trivial. Especially since they likely know that he knows the truth at that point.

      Fair. I do think having competing factions is more interesting from a world building standpoint.

      Agreed. I doubt he escaped on his own, but I do expect some sort of twist with his fate at some point, even if it isn't this soon.

  I already had my doubts, but now I'm seriously questioning whether Minerva ever existed.

  Either he was just a fabrication made by the poachers to lure unsuspecting children to their hunting grounds, or the poachers somehow discovered that escaped children where gathering at that place and decided to make it their base of operations.

  Or alternatively Minerva was fully aware that he was leading the children to the base of the poachers, but there is some vital reason that the children must go there in order to cross the boarder to the human world (or accomplish whatever Minerva's real objective is).

  Either way, it seems as if the children can no longer fully rely on Minerva's information to lead them to safety.
