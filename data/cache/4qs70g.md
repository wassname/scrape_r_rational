## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  In playing *[Star Wars: TIE Fighter](https://www.gog.com/game/star_wars_tie_fighter_special_edition)* a few days ago ([video](https://youtu.be/e1GegZSOblA?t=21m18s)), I was reminded of one of *[GURPS](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/Vehicles)*'s most awesome optional rules: [abstract dogfighting](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/42443024/Dogfighting%20Combat.html)! In wondering whether these rules could be applied to *Star Wars* vehicles, I ran across [this *Star Wars* Technical Commentaries page](http://www.theforce.net/swtc/units.html#lucasarts) that shows how *TIE Fighter* represents snubfighters as moving at only around 100 m/s (360 km/h, 224 mi/h). It's funny to imagine [the top-of-the-line TIE Advanced](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/TIE/ad_starfighter) moving at a speed of only 540 km/h when high-tier propeller-driven planes in *[War Thunder](https://warthunder.com/en/game/about)* regularly exceed *700* km/h ([example](https://youtu.be/BZ9AD9v6ZA4?t=4m35s))--to say nothing of the *jet*-propelled aircraft that are playable in the same game!

  On the other hand, of course, a starfighter also is far more maneuverable at such speeds than any fixed-wing aircraft could be, with [inertial compensators](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Inertial_compensator) and no resistance except [Space Friction](http://allthetropes.wikia.com/wiki/Space_Friction). Based on personal experiments, I estimate that all the *TIE Fighter* spacecraft have a maximum pitch rate of around 72 deg/s. (On the TIE Fighter, TIE Advanced, and Missile Boat, I can get 36 deg/s with the mouse controls, and I assume that I could manage twice this rate with a joystick, based on how quickly the mouse controls automatically recenter and decelerate the pitching.) This implies maximum G-forces (in *GURPS* terms, aMR--aerial Maneuver Rating) of 72 deg/s × π rad/180 deg × 100 m/s ÷ 9.81 (m/s^(2))/G = 13 G for a TIE fighter, or 19 G for a TIE Advanced. (Modern fighter aircraft, in contrast, have [turn rates around 30 deg/s](https://defenseissues.wordpress.com/2014/01/11/comparing-modern-western-fighters) and [aMRs around 9 G](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_Martin_F-22_Raptor#Specifications_.28F-22A.29).)

  Of course, there are several other items whose determination would be necessary for conducting an abstract dogfight in *GURPS* with *TIE Fighter*'s vehicles--most obviously, aAccel (Aerial Acceleration), shield generators, armor, and weapons, to say nothing of the other components that go into a starfighter (sensors, cockpit, power plant...). There might also have to be some house rules adjusting the G-forces, since a pilot (HT [Health] 10, plus a G-suit and a G-seat to reduce the effects of high acceleration) risks blacking out when pulling maneuvers above 8 G without resorting to ultra-tech items (e.g., inertial compensators).

  Someone in r/ParadoxPlaza came up with [an awesome idea](http://np.reddit.com/r/paradoxplaza/comments/4q68gu): Play an *infinite* megacampaign of grand-strategy games by assuming that, after 1936 or 1950 (whenever your preferred *[Victoria 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/Victoria2)* mod ends), the world falls into chaos (due to war or plague) and reverts to the level of 769 or 867 (whenever your preferred *[Crusader Kings 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/CrusaderKings)* mod begins)!

  I was somewhat astonished to come across these old Facebook posts ([1](http://i.imgur.com/6rF8PjH.png) [2](http://i.imgur.com/hAzHaRP.png)) stating unambiguously that, at some point, I named *[Background Pony](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/19198)* over *[Time Braid](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644)* as my official Favorite Story Ever, and kept it in that position for more than six months! My recollection of events surrounding *Background Pony* is that it was *tied* with *Time Braid* after my first reading of it, and that it sank to second-favorite fanfiction story after my second (and most recent) reading--but, of course, memories can be incorrect.

  [A side-splittingly hilarious example](http://i.imgur.com/8tcbn0x.png) of the incredible awesomeness of the MEIOU & Taxes mod for *[Europa Universalis IV](http://www.reddit.com/r/eu4)*: A player whines about how the people of his humongous, multiethnic, solidly-Catholic empire are turning to Protestantism during the Catholic Reformation! The modder with whom he's arguing explicitly compares his problems directly to the totally-historical situations of [Austria-Hungary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austro-Hungarian_Compromise_of_1867) and [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Wars_of_Religion)!

  > Put yourself in the shoes of the king of France, whose vast Kingdom was divided by heresy in a short time. He would probably have also railed against the unfairness of it all.

  I mean, being annoyed at history is fine! A few months ago, I myself rage-quitted a campaign as [Fez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marinid_dynasty) because my country--in possession of all of North Africa, but still a pathetic weakling compared to Western Europe--was about to be stomped flat by the aggression of Spain and its ally the Netherlands. (Thinking back on it, I probably should have just capitulated, moved my capital to Tunis, and continued the game. [shrugs]) However, complaining about historical accuracy to modders who have made historical accuracy their *goal* seems rather hilariously pointless.

  An interesting opinion: [Let's Ban New Books](https://www.gwern.net/Culture%20is%20not%20about%20Esthetics#lets-ban-new-books)!

  > 1\. Society ought to discourage economically inefficient activities.

  > 2\. If some good *a* can be created to fill a need, and there is an existing and available good *b* that fills that need equally well, then it is economically inefficient to use *a* and not *b*.

  > 3\. Consumers of new art would be equally satisfied by existing art.

  > 4\. By 2 and 3: it is economically inefficient to produce new art.

  > ∴ By 1 and 4: Society ought to discourage new art.

    That is not an interesting opinion; it is deplorable. If a strong AI proposed that, I would erase it.

    EDIT: On reflection, I think it *is* interesting in a reductio ad absurdum way, in that it demonstrates what kind of awful conclusions one will reach if they are missing basic moral axioms. It's an interesting scenario to scare me into remembering the importance of avoiding value divergence.

      I know several people on this forum have pointed out similarities between publicly traded companies and Unfriendly AIs optimising for a quantity called "shareholder value", and though the metaphor has holes in it it's not a bad place to start. (For-profit companies are not in any way *required* to maximise profits. They're strongly incentivized to, but other incentives exist.) 

      Something like that chain of logic is why, say, Coca-Cola doesn't write poetry (except for adverts, which doesn't count). Though they don't care at all whether other people write poetry, as long as it's not done on company time. Even from the perspective of an unfriendly AI, I would amend point 1 to "I should not perform economically inefficient activities" and change the conclusion accordingly.
      ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    I think the essay's point on new art being a drain on the economy is wrong. When it comes down to it, actual monetary resources are the only things expended on movies - the human effort and material effort is low. The effect is to make a few people rich, and facilitate economic flow for the rest of us. The point being that the trade in entertainment resources is an important part of the economy, and with the presence of digital media the only way to *effectively* trade entertainment is by making something new.

    His point about copyright somehow reinforcing the entertainment industry is, to put it lightly, completely fucking retarded. I don't know how someone could draw this conclusion (an irrational hate-boner for copyright or something) but it is most definitely wrong. Remember what I said in the last paragraph, about how the presence of digital storage and the internet made trading old works obsolete? Copyright deals exclusively in the rights of (now digital) distribution - that is, who is the one making money off of that Netflix deal. It's one of the *very* few pillars making traditional media distribution possible. Taking it away would strengthen the ability of content creators, not stop the tide of art and artistry.

    If you want to get a glimpse at where entertainment is headed, look at YouTube or DeviantArt - on DA, artists will take commissions (normal) to create a drawing that anyone can download and mess around with (not normal). The artist has made the money and the reputation, and the commissioner has the right to use the picture for commercial works. But if you want to gaze at the picture, hoping to find inspiration? Well go right ahead - it's not in a museum, it's on DeviantArt! In fact, there's nothing stopping you from downloading it and printing off your own poster, so long as you don't sell it. On YouTube, the majority of money made off of a video is made within the first month. After that, it's up to you to make a new video so that you can continue your profits. To a normal viewer, it's free - so long as you are willing to watch a fifteen second advertisement, the only limit on your time watching YouTube is your time. A producer might cut a sponsorship deal with something like Crunchyroll or Audible, but that goes on behind the scenes. Most advertisement is unobtrusive, so as to not scare off the audience. In both the case of YouTube and DeviantArt, the content and the distribution is basically free, but the creator is paid and the audience is satisfied.

    There are still a few kinks to work out, but that's the direction I think *all* entertainment is going.

    As usual, the "Parable of the Skills Gap" post has reminded me how terrible I am at understanding extended metaphor. Somewhere buried in the comments somebody explains what real situation each parable is meant to evoke (which I definitely did not understand on my own) and even so, I still feel like I'm missing something. I get the feeling that Ozy had a fundamental *point* to zer post, and I have no idea what it was. This is a feeling I experience very frequently with extended allegories where the exact correspondences are not made explicitly clear.

    I agree that Subaru is pretty stupid/exactly the kind of foolish main character this sub would like to collectively pick up and shake in the exact way you mustn't do with babies.

    If you are not caught up yet, the most recent episode will be suffering of a very different kind than just being killed over and over. The people who have read the Japanese web novel are saying that the current arc will break down most of Subaru's personality and force him to Grow The Fuck Up. 25 episodes is not short for an anime season, but the author has written a story several times longer than all of Harry Potter, so we are still 'early on'. I like the series, but I do look forward to seeing what happens when Subaru levels up.

    >currently learning Kanji and Hiragana

    If you are still on Hiragana, I found [tofugu](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/learn-hiragana/) to be great for both Hiragana and Katakana. Also [this drag and drop exercise.](http://www.csus.edu/indiv/s/sheaa/projects/genki/hiragana-timer.html)

      Just caught up yesterday. It was great and he deserved it. Their relationship felt [Re:Zero](#s "forced anyway (as in Subaru forcing it to happen rather than a natural progression of their interaction), I think he interacted more naturally with Rem than Emilia and as other Redditors suggested in the anime sub, they don't communicate effectively, both expect impossible things from the other based on an idealized image of how the other must behave and Emilia doesn't seem to respect him as a person. She always treats him like a child or a pet which may have to do with her age, it hasn't been explained yet but I believe she's probably several hundred years old or more. He also doesn't give her reasons to trust or respect him as he ends up undoing it due to brute forcing his way on all problems.")

      Hopefully he gets better afterwards, I read the author hates harem and classical shounen tropes and made the story to break from them so hopefully he grows beyond the [Idiot Hero](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHero) trope.

      I thought of making a fic with Kazuma ending up in the Re:Zero world, I guess I'll add it to the endless pile of ideas that haven't been able to start LOL

      Thanks for the resources! Currently was using spaced repetition with [Anki](http://ankisrs.net) but that site looks neat, will check.
      ```

      - u/Rhamni:
        ```
        Wanikani is another site that uses spaced repetition, although it assumes you know all Hiragana and starts with radicals and kanji. It's free for the first few weeks, and I found it helpful. That said, it only teaches you about 100 kanji per month, so lots of people just do the free levels and then switch over completely to Anki.

  >  Different ways to plot meteorological data?

  I've been sitting on this for a while, but yes!  As part of my Honours thesis I spent a month or so working out how to show fairly subtle local seasonality with custom meteorological figures.

  https://imgur.com/a/f7rNk

  The first (F4.1) is a pretty standard [climograph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climograph), though I show both max and min temperature as well as dewpoint (at which relative humidity would be 100%, a measure of moisture content which is very high in this area).

  The second (F4.2) shows wind direction, which is important in local Indigenous seasons.  The monsoon south-east winds are clear!  (further explanation in caption)

  Finally, F4.4 shows every day of observation for each of the eight variables, since the station opened ~15 years ago.  Tricky to read, but very very useful when I didn't yet know what I was looking at... and to show examiners that it's a complex topic!

  Years long lurker here posting for the first time, hello everyone! With all the awesomely intelligent  and creative people here I wanted to ask some quick questions:

  I've been recently wanting to recreate my online ID's and was wondering how everyone else runs theirs. I currently run 3 groups of emails and account: personal, professional, and fun(gaming/reddit/reading). With overlap between personal and professional I've decided to merge the two as best I can. The current debate I'm having is weather or not to merge my fun account into it. So I was wondering how everyone here felt/thought.
  Do you keep your online personalities separate from each other? From your personal identity?

  Also: I'm a avid note taker/theorizer/research compiler kind of person and I've realized that OneNote is becoming/is a mess once you reach a point. Does anyone have any suggestions on all the different software out there for personal databases? I'm currently honed in on ConnectedText but was wondering if anyone here had any hands on experience with other systems?
  ```

  - u/callmebrotherg:
    ```
    I try to keep everything overlapping, personally, but that's because I'm trying to build a writing career.
    ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    I have a personal/fun/everyday identity that I use for everything (this one), which is mostly kept separate from my actual identity. It's not terribly much work to connect the two, especially since I've been using this handle since before Google, but I think it helps put up a barrier between working life and personal life (since obviously I don't want to introduce myself to coworkers or clients using my online handle).

    I keep some other identities lying around, but they're usually paper-thin and just for posting things that I don't want directly connected to this online persona. I always keep them collapsible and follow the rules for ethical sockpuppetry though.
    ```

    - u/callmebrotherg:
      ```
      Collapsible?
      ```

      - u/alexanderwales:
        ```
        There's probably a better word for it.

        They need to be able to be merged back into my regular online identity with, at most, only mild embarrassment and no actual scandal or damage to me. I think of them as little inflatable extensions of my online identity that can be collapsed back in to the center mass, rather than blown.

  How do you make modern gunpowder from scratch?

  Black powder is comparatively easy for me to understand; find a surface source of sulfur, make a nitrary using manure and urine for saltpeter, burn wood to get charcoal, then mix them 10:75:15. Each step there is complicated with steps I don't exactly know, but at a high level I have little trouble with it.

  But how would you go about making modern smokeless powders (or even something like cordite) from base materials if you didn't have access to modern supply chains?

  Edit: Alright, someone correct me if I'm wrong. To make cordite you need nitroglycerin, nitrocellulose, and petroleum jelly.

  Nitrocellulose is made by dipping cotton into nitric acid. To make nitric acid, you run air through an electric current to create hot nitric oxide. This combines with atmospheric oxygen to create nitrogen dioxide. You dissolve that in water to create the nitric acid. So all we really need for base materials are water, cotton, and a powerful electric arc (the last one not really being a problem for my purposes).

  Nitroglycerin is made from white fuming nitric acid, sulfuric acid, and glycerol. You make WFNA by purifying nitric acid (somehow) and leaving a specific amount of water (again, somehow). Sulfuric acid can be made by burning sulfur with saltpeter in the presence of water. Glycerol can be made by gathering animal tallow and adding lye; it's part of the process for making soaps. Mix that all together in the right way to get nitroglycerin.

  Petroleum jelly ... that's a comparatively harder thing to get, it seems, but I don't know what function it serves in cordite and whether it can be replaced with a material that doesn't require comparatively modern and infrastructure heavy natural gas. Chemistry is a weak point for me.

  If any chemists are reading this, I'd like to know whether I can somehow get by without sulfur, natural gas, or any petroleum products, or any exotic metals (and I'm hoping that the answer is no, because I'd like for sulfur mines to be a plot point).

  Tried out the M&M pen and paper gaming system today with a new group, and I'm pretty happy with how it went. I need to re-think my character a bit now that I know how things work, but the group itself seems like a lot of fun.

  The quest I was writing, [Shinji Quest](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/shinji-quest-bleach-fate-stay-night-crossover-complete.389478/), has come to an end with 55,000 words. It's the longest thing I've written, and I almost didn't complete it. I'm glad I did. It felt good to actually complete something, even if it's just a quest.

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    So ... what exactly is a quest? I feel like I see them posted a lot and never read them. It's like some kind of reader-mediated prose fiction? People vote on where the story goes or something? But I've also seen them with stats and dice rolling, which makes it seem more like a pencil-and-paper RPG. I only have a tenuous grasp of the concept and conventions.
    ```

    - u/blazinghand:
      ```
      Basically, it's like D&D but instead of each player controlling a character, all the players jointly control a single character. This is usually done via voting. The character interacts with the rest of the world as written by the author, but character sheet generation and certain key decisions are up to the players. It's usually expected that the author use some kind of RPG system as a base to provide a framework for character generation and actions. 

      I wrote Shinji Quest in an attempt to do daily writing and hit 50,000 words. It's not actually great writing, but I don't think I'd have been able to write so much without the quest framework to motivate me.

        What's the copyright status of such a work? 

        I would like to be able to publish an original quest, but I never felt entirely comfortable because in some cases, the reader's participation are the key ingredient in writing such a story.
        ```

        - u/PeridexisErrant:
          ```
          Usually questionable. Requiring copyright assignment to participate would be possible I guess, and refusing write-in options could help. But ultimately there's enough uncertainty to invite lawsuits if commercial success ever sets in :/
          ```

        - u/callmebrotherg:
          ```
          Worst case, include a notice at the beginning of the thread that yada yada yada, participants participate in full knowledge that the quest may be edited and converted into commercial fiction and they waive any rights to the profit etc etc. 

          IANAL but that should that will cover you.

      As far as I'm aware, some operate according to an established structure of stats and skills (like a slimmed-down version of D&D) and give only some liberty to the DM/GM/QM; others roll with only the vaguest stats and penalties and give tons of liberty to the DM/GM/QM (e.g., Roll to Dodge); and still others have no die rolls at all and let the DM/GM/QM use his unfettered judgment. Formats vary *very* widely. 

      Both 4chan (the new /qst/ board) and Sufficient Velocity (the Quests subforum) contain many easily-perusable examples of the various kinds of interactive stories, and I occasionally see similar endeavors on FIMFiction.net. (FanFiction.net has banned them.)

  I'm seriously starting to wonder whether training like an athlete is worth it for me anymore. It's incredibly enjoyable, and I adore being strong and becoming stronger as a powerlifter, but the injuries are starting to become a problem, and for now I'm not willing to get on drugs, which would help a lot with injuries and recovery.

  On the other side, if I drop to a bodybuilding routine I would stop being competitive, and I do enjoy meets a lot, both for the competition and for the people.

  Guess I'll continue until I'm either willing to get on drugs or I get injured enough that I can't compete regardless.
