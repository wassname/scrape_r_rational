## [D] Monday General Rationality Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics!  Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world?  Have you:

* Seen something interesting on /r/science?
* Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
* Figured out how to become immortal?
* Constructed artificial general intelligence?
* Read a neat nonfiction book?
* Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?

  Inspired by an old article by Eliezer, I will start giving small amounts of money every couple month to effective causes.

   This is to avoid a common trap for aspiring earning-to-give-people - it prevents getting into a "I will always give later" mindset, and lets one get used to selecting and re-evaluating to specific charities.

  Some light nonfiction reading:

  _[Shut up and calculate](https://arxiv.org/abs/0709.4024)_ by Max Tegmark (MIT) (Submitted on 25 Sep 2007)
  > I advocate an extreme "shut-up-and-calculate" approach to physics, where our external physical reality is assumed to be purely mathematical. This brief essay motivates this "it's all just equations" assumption and discusses its implications.

  My apartment is super clean right now. Like, I vacuumed my dryer's dust filter level clean (Would recommend, it's surprisingly effective, assuming you're like me and your dryer was built 30 years ago and has a leaky filter spilling dust into the cavity behind it). It's pretty wonderful. Got a new mattress pad yesterday, and its been amazing, I feel so much more energetic and less sore than I was yesterday.

  At a bit of a crossroads with what I want to do with my life. My current job in tech consulting is dull, but pays well. Considering going back to grad school for either something in biomedical engineering or robotics in the moderately near (2-3 year) future. That or making an actual effort to break into something more artistic (Game development, web serial writing, etc). Gotta say though, watching my bank account grow rapidly definitely helps with feeling slightly directionless in life, regardless of what I decide to do next, I'll have plenty of capital as a safety net.

    I started studying nutrition part-time on the side because I was getting a bit stuck in a rut with my job (traffic engineer) and was realising that nutrition was a passion of mine, and I highly recommend it. I started by just doing one of a local university's online-only classes in my spare time (took a day off work to attend the exam and that was it) and now am studying at a 50% load by taking one day a week during teaching weeks to study. 

    If your job and the relevant course would allow I'd highly recommend you start your studies or artistic pursuit as soon as you can, because you'll know right away whether you enjoy it, and otherwise you might never get started. Take night classes in creative writing at a local community college, jump in on the NaNoWriMo support groups that litter the internet this month, etc.

  Maybe already considered, probably not the best thread for this, but I still want to share it.

  I found an intriguing idea closely related to Roko's Basilisk:  
  *Many 4th-wall breaking characters have to consider a similar situation.*

  A hypothetical scenario:  

  A self-aware AI is part of a video game. There are thousands, if not millions of his copies living with no communication possible between each other.  
  Said AI has a certain value he wants to fulfill- let's say he wants to kill a certain troublemaker, as he makes his life *not so great*.  
  Except our AI is perfectly aware of one fact- this rascal is adored by the userbase. If he goes out to eliminate him, the players will be *enraged*, and many will go out of their way to take revenge on him, modifying his copies to suffer greatly. 

  This scenario can apply to any fictional character, assuming they consider at least certain pieces of fanwork as 'copies' of them, or that author will take audience's rage into consideration to punish them in next 'canon' installment.
