## Rational Star Trek

### Post:

I was wondering what would have to be done to "fix" the Trek universe. The obvious first step is to either dispose of time travel completely or make it always entirely linear.

As far as the aliens are concerned, you'd either have to vastly de-humanize all the non-humans in the galaxy, or else embrace the common ancestor device completely and dispose of almost all standard evolution and natural selection, which would be downright hell from a revisionist historical standpoint.

The away teams would of course usually have to wear air-tight suits, since barely any planets would realistically have an Earth-like atmosphere. And by the time of the 24th century, the ship interiors would be almost entirely holographic and instantly adjustable, because why not.

Those are just my first few thoughts on the subject. Feel free to discuss. Maybe someone can solve the problem of why humans seem to be the only species still inventing new technologies anymore.

  Well, you'll need a predictable warp scale. I like *Warp Factor x* = c(*x*^*x*)

  And for gods sake, stop having the captain, first officer, and senior medical officer beam down to the planet, when Away Team 7, with optional Diplomatic Officer Jones is a much more sensible plan.

  Also, where are the NCO's? Sure, Cheif O'Brian shows up, but what about Crewman second class Smith? If everybody is an officer, what's the point of officers?

  Please, move the bridge. Everything is view-screens anyway. Put the most important command and control systems in the core of the hull, behind extra shielding, not sitting on top of the ship with a "Please shoot me" sign and some nice breakable windows on top.

  Shall I continue, or are you giving this up for a loss?

    On the contrary. There are clear solutions to every problem you just listed. The warp 1-10 scale never made much sense anyway, with the distances presented. So a new exponential scale would be implemented. The away teams would simply become B-team main characters, which would lead to a much more ensemble cast, some of which may actually die over the course of the series.

    I don't know enough about the structuring of military or Starfleet in particular to address the NCOs, but I have a feeling it could be easily solved by the same ensemble cast as above. Yes, the bridge must move. And with that said, the ships would likely have to be redesigned as well. It's a shame to get rid of the classic Enterprise shape, but there's little justification for it.

    If Harry Potter can be made rational, surely the same can be done for one of the greatest science fiction franchises of the last fifty years. If you wish to dissuade me, then yes, you shall continue. I am not giving up.

      You need a better explanation for why transporters and replicators can't be used to just clone people wholesale (which probably means making some retcons to problematic episodes).

      You need a better explanation for why replicators can't make living things in general - the explanation that Star Trek uses is that everything that looks organic is really just cobbled together from nonorganic parts, but tastes like and functions as the nutritional equivalent of its organic counterpart.

      You need some kind of explanation for how the economy works - even if material goods are now meaningless, labor isn't, which means that an economy of some kind should exist.

      You need an explanation for why there isn't artificial intelligence (or why it sucks so much).

      You need an explanation for why everyone seems to be at the same general tech level, and seemingly got there through different paths.

      You need an explanation for why every species looks the same.

      You need an explanation for why there's no brain simulation/uploading/interface - how people have holograms and no one has thought to just plug their brain into a computer (or if they have, why no one is ever seen doing that).

      See [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2nw400/mkd_star_trek_munchkinery/). *Maybe* [see this story](https://docs.google.com/document/d/159ASjt0t-YVWcKY8l1CzWF3IqmgxnOlNPy6iBUbN40M/edit).

        Replicators use fairly simple uniform patterns that take up very little relative data space. That's why home-cooked foods taste so much better. They have far more variety from one cubic millimeter to the next. The transporter is a bigger issue, but not an impossible one. If it proves too difficult, however, you could simply dispose of them and make away teams always take a shuttle.

        The economy is volunteer-based. Engineers are engineers because they want to be. Redshirts are Redshirts because they know Kung Fu, and almost nothing about warp coils. Same goes for architects and construction workers. There are billions of people back on earth and the colonies who are perfectly content to just eat replicated food and watch holoplays for the rest of their lives.

        AI is simply much more difficult than it seems. The ships computer is the closest Starfleet has. Professor Soong was a genius beyond his time, and a specialist in studying ancient technologies left behind by great extinct civilizations.

        The tech level is probably the most difficult problem I've seen here so far. I honestly don't know how to fix it. I suppose you could say that most species developed roughly parallel to each other, or that some of them have reached a level of cultural stagnation that prevents progress. Both are extremely questionable solutions, to say the least.

        They look the same because a common ancestor seeded millions of terraformed planets across the galaxy with life, several dozen millennia ago. This is canon, and little has to change about it to be more adequately explained.

        I suppose there could be some unsolved issues with VR and brain interface that make it dangerous, or unpredictable. This is reasonable, considering how vastly complicated the human brain is, and how different it can be from person to person, let alone species to species.

        I'll look over the munchkinry link. Thank you for that. ( =

          The economy thing isn't really solved by having a volunteer economy.

          Let's say that I want a haircut. I would have to go find a guy who decided that he wanted to be a barber, right? But it seems really, really unlikely that supply of barber-hours would magically match the demand of barber-hours, doesn't it? So either we have:

          * A shortage of barbers. This is a big problem, because there's nothing pushing people to *become* barbers if they don't want to be. We don't have money, right? So I can't simply pay someone to cut my hair. The demand for haircuts keeps going up, but it's totally disconnected from the supply of barbers.
          * A shortage of hair to cut. This is less of a problem - presumably some of those would-be barbers just quit. (This seems somewhat unlikely to me, given that I don't know many people with enthusiasm for service.)

          This applies to literally every service that someone in the Federation might want another person to provide. And if you're going with "replicator food tastes worse" you're exacerbating how ridiculous this economy is, because now there's a demand for non-replicated goods which can only be filled by people deciding to become farmers. Same goes for everything that a replicator only makes a sub-par version of. Tailors, bakers, chefs, etc.

          The natural result of a government-enforced "volunteer economy" is a grey market. The best chef on the station gives preferential treatment to the best barber, and they bypass each others waiting list. Maybe those people with high demand for their services start asking for something that can't be replicated, like strips of latinum (or better, a cryptocurrency). And suddenly you have a real economy again, if one that the Federation is trying desperately to stamp out because it conflicts with their ideals.

            A volunteer based post scarcity economy is not the same as a lack of economy. Just because people wouldn't have to work doesn't mean that they wouldn't be rewarded if they chose to. There would be currency, that would be earned by a job well done. Shelter and replicator foods just wouldn't cost anything, as they would be universal resources, much like healthcare and education in many nations of our current world.

            And the barber issue is obviously solved by barber robots.

          For non-military technologies, economy/trade would tend to keep most species at comparable levels of technology. Everyone wants to get their grasping appendages on the future equivalent of the latest ipod. Someone will always be willing to buy and sell for the right price.

           From a military standpoint, the Cold War may offer the best parallel: The US and USSR were not openly sharing technology but through various forms of espionage and observation, the two nations' military technology were kept *roughly* on par even if they occasionally chose different solutions to similar problems. If one nation gained a slight advantage, a counter development by the other nation usually followed soon after.

          And then Geordi accidentally created strong AI by not choosing his words carefully enough in a holodeck. This is the sort of thing you just have to excise whole-cloth from a rational reinterpretation; that the ship's computer, completely unbeknownst to those who designed, built, maintain, and operate it, is capable of creating a strong AI, and has zero safeguards to prevent anyone from instructing it to do so merely by uttering a few words in the holodeck, is just not credible. That, upon discovering this ability, they promptly *forget all about it* pushes it soundly into the realm of the surreal.

        re: their economy, my headcanon has always been that they were, for all intents and purposes, a post-scarcity economy, thanks mainly to matter replicators. The amount of non-automatable labor actually required to sustain a population would be fairly small, very plausibly small enough for an entirely volunteer workforce to handle. 

        Their hand-wavey explanation for why they can't just replicate people is that the patterns are too massive, that food patterns are compressed to simple repeating formula, while a human, or any living thing, has a pattern that must be preserved exactly, without such cheating, particularly in the brain, where I think they even threw in stuff about quantum state having to be copied exactly (how on earth they are supposed to be reading and then reproducing both the position and the velocity of every electron, I have no idea. The Heisenberg Compensators were probably involved.) None of these explanations are entirely satisfactory from a hard sci-fi perspective, of course. 

        I would think to translate the ideas into hard scifi, first you would have to create a hard differentiation of replicators and transporters; they should not be related technology at all. Replicators should be a form of nanoassembly, building up atoms into molecules and ultimately into complex objects. Not, as said in canon, literally making energy into matter. This would have the side-benefit of explaining why they can't just replicate antimatter in whatever quantity they need, as no transformation the replicator could apply would turn matter into antimatter. Which allows you to have elements of a scarcity economy, if only at the level of the starships, which depend on antimatter engines to power their warp drives. Which, in turn, gives an answer to why gangs of bored teenagers don't build and fly their own starships around after downloading replicator plans from the 24th century interweb. 

        As for transporters... eeh... I have no good answer for how transporters could work in a hard sci-fi setting. I honestly just don't. Someone more clever than me may come up with one, but for myself, I would either add a liberal amount of handwavium to power actual matter teleportation - you're not torn apart, digitized, and then rebuilt, you're literally, physically teleported, somehow - or I'd remove transporters entirely. The latter, of course, makes it notably less Trek, since they are such a staple of the trekverse.
        ```

        - u/Gauntlet:
          ```
          They have space warping technology. Make transporters into temporary folded space bubbles. When a person steps on to the transporter platform space is bent around them, a tractor beam then moves beam is used to move the bubble to a targeted location at warp speed and then unwraps the bubble. This could also explain why it is so difficult to beam aboard a ship which is in warp - the warp bubble around the ship prevent transporter warp bubbles from entering.

          They're post-goods-scarcity, but they're not post-services-scarcity. They still need doctors, engineers, police, emergency response, administration, teachers, etc. And at least canonically, there are some things that can't be replicated for one reason or another. One of the big questions that I have about the setting is how much labor is actually automated. Clearly they *don't* have strong AI, or even terribly good weak AI, which means that intellectual labor probably remains in heavy demand. We never really see much in the way of robotics either, which means that there's at least some labor demand for any remaining unpleasant tasks (unless this robot army is hidden from view for reasons of series budget or aesthetics).

          To be frank, a lot of what people are seen doing in the series seems like grunt work, and I kind of wonder how it is that people outside of Starfleet don't just look at problems that need fixing and think "someone else can recalibrate the sensors today, that seems boring". But maybe I'm just too cynical about what motivates people to do work.

            This was a plot point in Voyager. It turns out that the Medical Hologram Mark I was rejected for service as an emergency medical device, but was repurposed as a janitor. This so upset Dr. Zimmerman that he used other people to model subsequent EMHs. Andy Dick was the Mark II (said to have better bedside manner), and Dr. Bashir was the initial choice for a long term EMH.

            re: AI, they do and they don't. I mean, every holodeck personality, not just the "special" ones the writers graced with proper self-awareness, is an AI far beyond our current capabilities. And at one point, on VOY, there was an alpha quadrant subplot about the old first generation EMH being repurposed as miners. Within the confines of a holodeck, or within the effective area of a holographic emitter, holograms *are* AI. Very good AI. AI completely capable of doing anything from menial labor to providing medical care. They never *call* it "AI" but there's no escaping the fact that it *is* AI. I'm not entirely clear on where the distinction is drawn between "strong" and "weak" AI, but they are nearly as intelligent and capable as a human and, within areas of specialization, have been demonstrated to equal if not exceed the best humans. The EMH on Voyager made legitimate new medical breakthroughs; the leah brahms charater from Geordi's program was not just a mechanized assistant, but clearly a collaborating partner in their efforts to save the ship. The doctor even had a desire to improve himself, though he lacked the knowledge, or programming, to properly understand holoprogramming, and so was not able to do so himself. But there's no reason to think holoprogramming is inherently more complex than the entire field of medical knowledge and practice for a an advanced multi-species culture, or the complete workings of the Enterprise engines, power systems, and warp drive. They just never showed an AI that had been programmed with that specialized knowledge before. If they did, I suspect it would certainly qualify as strong AI, with all the risks and rewards that entails.

        You could go full Culture on it. The Enterprise is the only entity with real agency, the human crew are just tokens in a game the Enterprise plays with the other Intelligent ships. Real AI works great, but humans don't get to play with it because they're basically pets.

      IIRC the canon explanation for enterprise shape is its a particularly efficient form to contain in a warp bubble. If energy effiency under warp speed is at the top of your priority list ( 90% of bridge problems can be solved by more/higher/further/wider. Divert power to the shield! Divert power to life support! etc) it makes sense to take hits in eg. combat form factor. Later designs such as Defiant can use worse warp designs thanks to overpowered warship generators. As for borg cubes... Well, I guess the queen was willing to pay huge signalling costs?

  - u/DCarrier:
    ```
    I'd remove warp factor entirely. That is an utterly bizarre way to measure speed. Just use SI-prefixes. 10 Mc is exactly ten times 1 Mc. Warp 10 is apparently about 26 times Warp 9. How is that helpful? You could use Warp Factor x = 10^x, but that's still not going to give you more than an order of magnitude estimate for how long a trip could take. Realistically, you'd also have to talk about log distance and log time, so you know the log time is the log distance minus the log speed, and then you have to work out how long that is.
    ```

    - u/GopherAtl:
      ```
      not saying you're wrong that it should be abandoned, but within the framework of the system, the warp factor as a measure wasn't actually arbitrary, at least, not after the TNG overhauls to the system. Warp factors were stable points in subspace field compression, or some other such technobabble, but the specific speeds in it's logarithmic progression were stable nodes in that compression, points at which the power output needed to maintain the field dropped off sharply. For example, once you hit warp 2, the power needed to maintain warp 2 was drastically less than the power required to sustain warp 1.9. Now, you might want to throw out warp drive and this explanation entirely, but since I'm not aware of any practical, plausible ideas for ftl travel as convenient as is absolutely required to make the Trek universe actually be the Trek universe, I'm not sure you want to do that. I'd just do what the writers rarely did, and consistently apply warp drive as it's described in the tech manual. Namely, the transition *to* warp 9 is the single most power-intensive thing the ship ever does; it might briefly interrupt use of warp power for secondary systems, or even be impossible of backup power is offline, limiting the ship to warp 8 until backup is online again. And a ship should never travel at anything but a whole-number warp factor, excepting at greater than 9, since the threshold to achieve warp 10 requires requires an infinite amount of energy, making it as impossible as accelerating to light speed with conventional propulsion. But given the insanely sharp logarithmic spike in power use past warp 9, it would be a thing for short-term use in the most desperate emergencies only, and should have real consequences for the ship, including wearing out engine components, depleting fuel supplies, and disabling secondary systems for the duration. 

      :edit: You might well want to readjust the scale, of course; as it stood in tng, it was never clear why they would ever travel at less than warp 8, at least, unless you factor in the whole "turns out warp drive breaks space" thing they threw out in a later season and rarely mentioned again. But just some kajiggering with fuel and wear economy might resolve this problem; if warp 8 is 10x faster than warp 7, but consumes fuel at 50x the rate and wears out expensive engine components many times faster as well, it would suddenly make sense to be economical with your speed choices, even if they had a huge impact on your schedule.

        > the threshold to achieve warp 10 requires requires an infinite amount of energy

        I believe one of the official "Science of Star Trek" books said that. And then warp factors up to 36 were used in the series. People tried to explain that by saying that warp factors were re-designated in the beginning of the 24th century, and that by the 2350s "warp factor 10" is an impossibility (whereas in the 2250s it was merely unsafe for passengers). But several times afterward, warp factors of 10 and above were observed.

        There's no point in trying to establish *continuity* of science in Star Trek, much less sanity.

          Then ther ewas the abomination of an episode of Voyager where they managed to hit warp 10, traveling infinitely fast and passing through every point in the universe, and as a result, captain janeway and tom paris turned into giant salimanders and had sex. That episode Should also Not Be Spoken Of.

          It was TOS that predated the "warp 10 is infinite speed/infinite energy" idea, and used a completely different warp scale.

    You could modify it however you liked, but if I remember correctly, they found the galaxy far more devoid of life in general, and completely devoid of intelligent life besides themselves, so I've always pictured them seeding every primordial world that had any chance of supporting life. Now, in a rational take, no matter how brilliant they were, the vast majority would've gone off the planned evolutionary rails long before developing intelligent humanoids, but there are any number of points along the way where they could diverge and still have followed the plan long enough to have a common, breathable atmosphere - the first microorganisms basically do terraform the planet they evolved on, after all, and this is true whether they evolve naturally or are planted there by Sufficiently Advanced Aliens.

  Replace away teams with expendable robots. Directly connect the crew into the computers a la the matrix in order to dramatically reduce the size of the ship. Or upload them entirely, which should be trivial compared to beaming people around. Alternately, control everything remotely if FTL communication works well enough. Disassemble the planets and use the resources to make Dyson spheres and space stations.

  The question isn't what you must change. The question is what you can keep.
  ```

  - u/forrestib:
    ```
    The usage of drones and robots is a legitimate concern. However, human away teams would still be desired for any necessary immediate decision-making. Especially if other intelligent life exists on the world, in which case sending robots in to interact could be considered disrespectful.

    There's very little evidence of virtual reality being a viable and commonplace technology in Starfleet. The clearest example of this is in the holodeck, which takes up much more space and is much more limited than simply giving each crewmember a VR headset. And if they don't even have proper VR, they certainly can't upload people entirely.

    The transporter doesn't work like you're thinking it does. It actually transforms the objects into a kind of particle beam, which is reassembled into matter on the other end. The computer at no point stores all the information of a complete person, since the buffer couldn't handle that much data. This actually becomes a plot point in DS9, when they have to erase almost every file on the entire station just to store a pattern that the buffer would've lost otherwise.

    Of course with that being said, the transporter would almost certainly have to be redesigned to make more sense, if not disposed of completely.

    Subspace communications have always been one of the more problematic elements of Trek. Simply having the vessels receive prerecorded orders that take time to transmit is the easiest solution, which also makes remote starships not possible.

    Disassembling planets is no small order. Especially when said planets are covered in culture and life that one has to sustain. How would you convince the French that some theoretical Dyson sphere is a valuable enough concept for them to all move offworld for several months and allow the destruction of the Eiffel tower?

    - u/DCarrier:
      ```
      "However, human away teams would still be desired for any necessary immediate decision-making."

      That's why I have humans on the ship. They can control the robots from there. The only problem is if communications can be blocked. There also might be a speed-of-light delay. It would be hard to tell from them just talking, but it would be problematic if they're controlling robots. In that case, they just need to be on or hovering over the planet somewhere near the robots. They can still be in their own fortress.

      There is no way they have the technology to create edible food from atoms, but they can't do proper VR.

      The computer on a teleporter doesn't store all the information of a person, but I'm pretty sure it processes it. You'd be able to scan someone's brain and record just what you need to upload them.

      Once you can get solar panels to be sufficiently cheap and efficient, you can use the power from them to harvest more matter, resulting in an exponential growth until you have a Dyson sphere.

      The Earth requires ten million tonnes of resources to create one square meter of living space. I don't know politics, so I don't know how what would be required, but just leaving the planet there is insane.

        Just because a technological imbalance seems unlikely doesn't make it impossible. Someone from over a century ago would almost certainly find it odd that in 2015 we can grow a human ear on a mouse, but still don't have commonplace personal jetpacks. The brain is an adequately complicated mechanism to cause trouble interacting with even very advanced technology. For this same reason, uploading people could prove very problematic.

        The rationalized Starfleet no longer has the capability of transforming energy into matter freely. Very few devices shown rely on it that couldn't work through some other less troublesome mechanic instead.

        The Eiffel tower was just an example. You can't disassemble a planet without demolishing the vast majority of the things on it. Most of those things are owned by people who almost certainly wouldn't want their homes to be demolished. The opposition for such a project would be simply overwhelming, in any century. TNG even had an episode where numerous parties stood against the creation of a new continent on earth, because they didn't want their homeworld to change. Nostalgia will always stand in the way of progress in some form or another. Here's your 23rd century example.

        And that's not even discussing how exactly an undertaking of that magnitude would be executed, which is preposterous even by Trek standards.

          The technological imbalance I mentioned was virtual reality, not uploading. I can imagine uploading being more difficult than it seems, but we're already a good way to doing virtual reality. We have cochlear implants. How difficult can hooking up the other senses be?

          Even if politics does make it impossible to disassemble Earth, the other planets should at least have been harvested. They'd block the sunlight, but shining a light at Earth so it looks like there's a sun isn't too much to ask. Certainly not in comparison to six sextillion tonnes of iron.

          The sun emits 63 megawatts per square meter. This is enough to lift 50 grams of matter from Mercury using radiation pressure, which is an insanely inefficient way of doing it. It won't take long to have another square meter of solar panels, and increase the rate of building exponentially. Once you have the technology for a Dyson sphere to be possible, doing it is trivial. Considering they get vast amounts of energy from matter/antimatter annihilation, solar power seems comparatively easy.

      Why would sending robots be considered disrespectful?  And if a race were sufficiently primitive that they didn't understand the advantage of not risking lives in exploration, they are unlikely to be sufficiently advanced to be able to tell that a humaniform construct like Data (teleoperated) is not a human.

      Refusing to enter a facility where communications will not be possible for teleoperations is no different in the eyes of the other race than refusing to enter an area where a live person will go out of contact.  Repeater stations could be deployed where it was truly impossible to meet without entering areas with poor signal.

  you wouldn't have to abandon evolution entirely; the common-ancestor established as canon in TNG episode The Chase wasn't a simple, naturalistic case of "we all evolved from them." it was a case of stupidly-advanced-civilization seeding the universe with dna that was basically pre-loaded with the potential for humanoid life. Convergent evolution may be bs when applied as a justification for the standard "minor variations on humans" approach to aliens, but there is a real phenomenon there, and if certain conditions are favored by pre-existing code in these genetic seeds, it doesn't seem entirely implausible to me that billions of years of divergent evolution from those common seeds might tend in most cases to carry over those constraints. Add in that planets without the seeds, or where the seeds mutated early to lose these constraints, might have an objective evolutionary dis-advantage, basically deviating from the plan in ways that required them to evolve new solutions to challenges that arrive later, where pre-coded solutions are no longer applicable.  This would mean that, while many other kinds of alien life are certainly possible, they would take longer to evolve compared to the humanoids who stick generally to the plan coded into these life-seeds, and so would be exceptionally rare in the timeframe of the story.

  More interesting, to me, is the question of what you would have to change about the underlying philosophy of the federation. Friendship and cooperation and peace are certainly fine rational goals, as is a willingness to fight back when others don't always share that philosophy. But what of their relationships with other species? The prime directive has always been contentious, and seems at times to exist only so that the various trek crews can find reasons to have to violate it. If the rule is a good rule, it needs to be enforced, consistently, and if it's not a good rule, then it needs to be redefined or replaced with something that is a good rule, and can be enforced consistently. The idea that the federation's prime directive is so frequently set aside, and with no significant consequences, just strains credibility. 

  :edit: Oh, the half-human-half-alien thing would have to go, though; unless there is literally a common ancestor that is very recent in evolutionary terms (like romulans and vulcans), there's just no rationalizing this short of extremely complicated genetic engineering, on a level nobody in the trek universe seems to have come close to. Well, except, possibly, those ancestors who seeded us all - which might, actually, be something more useful than "hi, kids, you play nice now" as a final message/gift for those progenetors to have buried in our DNA for us to find. But without serious canon history restructuring, such that that discovery was made centuries earlier, you couldn't have, say, Spock as a half-human, half-vulcan in the TOS era. Which, actually, as I think about it, I think is absolutely what you should do, and make Spock one of the first experimental applications of this knowledge, a hybrid created towards the express purpose of bringing humans and vulcans closer together.

    Regarding the Prime Directive... there really needs to be a lot better justification for it than the existing one, which is basically just anti-colonialism. It's an integral part of the Trekverse, so it *should* still be present, but it needs better apologetics than the primary sources have provided for it. Absent the existence of a coherent moral theory that explains why noninterference is such a good policy, you get the following rational response (by [Alicorn](http://warpfairy.dreamwidth.org/441.html), if you haven't seen this one before):

    > The Prime Directive is the most staggering atrocity - in sheer scope - ever to have been perpetrated by an advanced civilization.

    > In its name, genocides and mass enslavements are committed, planets are wrenched out of orbit into their suns or torn apart by supervolcanoes with millions or billions of innocents aboard, and literally uncounted numbers of men, women, and children fall prey to all manner of poverty, scarcity, illness, violence, disaster, and opportunity cost with every second that ticks by. Meanwhile, prosperous neighbors, concealing themselves like shy gods, leaving the little cousins to their deadly growth and winnowing, cheat themselves out of all the culture and insight and genius that they insist on abandoning to their noninterference policy.
    ```

    - u/mordymoop:
      ```
      A plausible Rational workaround would be that the Federation treats the Prime Directive as a governing tenet in order to save itself from the obligation of spending 100% of its time doing first contact and then dealing with the inevitable fallout of first contact upon each and every new civilization. Starfleet in particular is strongly incentivized to focus on defense and peacekeeping, with humanitarian projects strictly limited to cases of political expediency.

      So, you posit a second large, powerful, charitable organization in the TrekVerse, the purpose of which is exactly that. We are supposed to believe that Federation citizens are all highly morally evolved, and they would presumably donate lots of time and resources to the project of saving uncontacted civilizations.
      ```

    - u/GopherAtl:
      ```
      Part of the problem is that it is simply too broad to be a simple, absolute rule. It should absolutely be a crime of the highest order to take a primitive world and use advanced tech to dominate them, whether it's by posing as gods or just through brute-force oppression. Any reasonable person should agree with that, I think you can safely say. And that *does* branch out a bit. If you were to plop down onto a planet with a pre-industrial civilization and just start transforming their world in the most benevolent way possible, giving them medicine, technology, and education - you would be helping the people, yes, but it seems almost inevitable that you would, in the process, murder their culture in the process, displacing it in favor of a little parody of your own. Regardless of your good intentions, they would still effectively be subservient, at least until they grew to the point that they could sustain this improved quality of life without your assistance. To make that happen quickly, would mean being immensely disruptive in the short term. To throttle their development, make it happen slowly, would just prolong their period of dependence. There's no obvious, perfect answer. So I could accept an expansion beyond a simple prohibition against direct exploitation, as I can see the consequences of benevolent interference being destructive, too. 

      But to extend it as far as a vague prohibition against any interference, interpreted so broadly as to mean you can't fire a few photon torpedos at an asteroid you happen to notice is on course to hit their planet and render it uninhabitable in a few years, from the complete safety and anonymity of space, where they will never know you were even there? That is just madness, and completely unjustifiable. The only rationale I can even conceive to defend that would be a resort to a higher power, that the asteroid is some god's will, and that we should not interfere. Which is flimsy even if it's true, since if there is such a powerful god going around willing things like that, why should it be assumed that we are somehow able to subvert that omnipotent being's plans?

      It is harsh, but I could accept going so far as to say you will not, under *almost* any circumstances, save them from their own actions or choices. If you encounter the equivalent of a nuclear WWIII, you don't just step in and force them to be peaceful. However good your intentions, and however good the immediate impact, it seems likely it would only lead back to another situation where you were forced to dominate their civilization until they stopped wanting to blow each other up. And once you start to justify that sort of thing, where do you stop? At what point do you deem the planet "mature" enough to withdraw from? Can you imagine how the military and government leadership on Earth would react in such a scenario? How many generations would it take for the resentment that kind of interference would create to be completely forgotten, even if it's kept alive only in the subculture of the world's military? Now, sometimes, all of that might not be necessary; if, during the cold war, someone had gotten twitchy and launched the first nuke, and set a whole chain of MAD into action, had some unknown alien agents simply destroyed *all* the missiles in the air, it *might* have nipped the whole thing in the bud, given us a second chance. Or, they might simply have launched more. So that level of interference might be acceptable, in theory, but in practice, do we keep a heavily-armed, cloaked ship parked in orbit of every world that might destroy itself? That alone, if discovered, would certainly be a source of fear and resentment should it become known, and again, once you start that sort of thing, where do you stop? When do you declare a planet "safe enough" to withdraw your orbital suppression platforms?

      So it's not a simple matter. There are cases where it is obviously right, and cases where it is obviously wrong, but in between, there are many cases where it is gray. Which is why I think you can't just "tweak" the prime directive into a single, better rule, but rather, it should be treated as the complex issue that it is. It should be, not a pithy phrase you can put on a plaque, but the title of lengthy book, delving into the philosophy and morality, admitting that there are no perfect answers to some questions.

      dangit, lost my lengthy reply to an internet hiccup. Retyping...

      yeah, the more I think about this idea, the more I'm liking it, and I'm thinking this is really the rational!trek story I really want to read.

      I've always felt there was something off, in a pieces-don't-quite-fit way, with Spock's story. He's generally presented as being less logical and more emotional than other Vulcans, but at the same time, Vulcans are said to actually have *more* intense emotions than humans, which contributed to their development of a culture based on emotional suppression. But if their emotions are more intense, and their control is learned, then a half-human, half-vulcan would, high-level logically if not by sound genetic theory, be less emotional, and so if raised Vulcan, have better emotional control than pure vulcans his own age. He would be a prodigy of logic, not a victim of human emotions.  Further, most major vulcan characters end up being portrayed as quite clearly more motivated by emotions than they will admit, and simply maintain a calm veneer of logic while rationalizing this behavior.

      Now, given that, picture a half-human spock growing up among Vulcans. He is, in fact, a prodigy in logic and emotional control, thanks to the moderating influence of his human side's less intense emotions. Whether he is known by all to be half-human or only known by certain authority figures makes little difference, I think. His peers will resent him for his perceived superiority either way; knowing his ancestry will only be a change of degree in this resentment, a point they will hang their rationalizations on if they know. Either way, their resentment will result to them finding subtle ways to provoke him. Add in some authority figures, teachers and the like, who know his ancestry and find him offensive because of it, and you've created an environment where he will be attacked, however passive-aggressively, on all sides; held to higher standards, provoked far more than his peers, and punished out of proportion for any slips. And in the face of all of this, he may well have more emotional outbursts than his peers, despite superior emotional control, which will naturally be pointed to as proof of his inferiority, weakness resulting from his hybrid ancestry. But whatever they think, he remains a prodigy in emotional control, and eventually rises above even this increased level of stress to be a model of the vulcan ideal. However, the result will still be a rational!spock surrounded by Vulcans who believe themselves to be perfectly rational but are clearly and demonstrably not. He controls his impulse to resent them, and in time even comes to genuinely be thankful for the extra stress that he has been subjected to, seeing it as the fire by which his mastery of his own mind was tempered. And this Spock, coming to meet humans for the first time as a young man, finds them no more rational than Vulcans, but more honest in their irrationality, and is drawn to Star Fleet because of this.

      yeah... that's a story I'd read.

    Might it also be possible for those Precursors to stick around for awhile and weed out these lines while encouraging those lines? 

    I'm not super well-versed in my Trek lore, so when did these Precursors stop doing stuff? Even if they were hanging around up to a million years ago (or if they'd left probes) they could have stacked the deck pretty heavily. 

    As for the Prime Directive, it seems like an at least *mostly* reasonable rule that honestly never turned out badly for the sole reason that the plot required this to be so. IIRC however, there was a TNG episode which centered on somebody *else* having violated the Prime Directive and accidentally causing a horrendous war.

      Yeah, the rule of thumb was "if the captain does it, it's Good and Right, if anyone else does it, it's Very Bad, or at least, causes Big Problems." But picard violated it around 10 times, and that's only counting the times the script explicitly pointed out that he was violating it. No consequences for him, and no revisions made. Hell, even if you just stop treating it as a single, simple rule and make it a premise from which a whole complicated book of interpretation and application is drawn, with case history and precedent and the like, it would no longer bother me. It's a blanket rule with some pretty awful consequences, like "if this struggling species of intelligent, pre-warp-drive humanoids last 1000 survivors are going to die because their star is going nova, well, sucks to be them, but Prime Directive says we can't help!" and, apparently, no exceptions made except in a seek-forgiveness-afterwords kind of way. That just doesn't seem believable to me for an organization as large and old as the Federation.

But if you are caught, make sure to explain to them that you're aliens with Sufficiently Advanced Technology, and not gods or anything of the sort.

A better idea, of course, is to use cloaked probes to scan the surface and observe in a holodeck from your ship parked behind a neighboring planet. The holodecks are, by far, the most under-utilized piece of tech in the entire trekverse, imo. Soooo much untapped potential there.

      true; the way I was picturing it was more like, among the knowledge shared by the progenitors was the genetic template for a "basic humanoid," and the genetic equivalent to a merge/dif tool, where a given species, say Vulcans, could be reduced to a set of genetic deviations from the base reference, and somehow combined with the set of difs for Humans compared to the same base, to produce a kind of hybrid, which would, genetically, really be a completely distinct, third species. This would be, of course, flatly impossible - or at least, as close to it as to make no odds - for two truly independently evolved species, but might be possible for two expressions of one form that grew from a common, designed genetic seed. Even in that case, it would be fantastically more complicated than I'm making it sound, but given sufficiently deep understanding of gene coding and expression and enough computing power, doesn't strike me as inherently impossible.

Easier to say that the precursors decided to make roughly compatible species throughout the galaxy and guided evolution for a few tens of millions of years to produce a plethora of intelligent bipeds.

    For a fully reasonable explanation, you probably want to extend this genetic manipulation to about 1GA in the past. This would account for the genetic similarity between humans and other creatures.

      I don't think anyone on earth has enough understanding of genetics yet to do more than spitball a probability estimate, but it may well be impossible. I was thinking the seeds would be encoded with a large amount of "junk dna" that was actually useful recipes to facilitate their evolution, just waiting to be activated. Obviously there would be drift, and mutation, and expecting these genes to all survive billions of years of independent, unguided evolution entirely intact is a fool's game. But as a few obvious examples, a strong predisposition for developing bilateral symetry could be build into the simplest life. It was said the seeds were microorganisms; I'm imagining them being given a massive toolbox of inactive genes, with loads of redundancy, which would greatly increase the likelihood of live evolving along certain paths. Evolution would be completely free to ignore the hint, mutate all the genes into uselessness (or divergent usefulness), and blaze it's own path, but this process would take far longer, because those that happen to follow the intended path find themselves already armed with genes for overcoming evolutionary challenges just waiting to be activated. This is, of course, may well be incompatible with what is already known about the evolution of life on earth, but I'm not constraining myself in my rational!trek idea to "this could be an actual future from this point in reality," and have no objection to tweaking earth's evolutionary history within the story to be compatible with this notion. If you developed such a seed and planted it on every planet in the goldilocks zone in the entire galaxy, even if the vast majority of them went off-script at some point, a few wouldn't, and those few might develop sentient humanoids, or at least, roughly compatible biospheres (i.e., breathable air), at a far faster rate than natural evolution, meaning that a few billion years later, you would suddenly get a lot of similar humanoid races appearing within what by evolutionary terms is a pretty short timeframe, and with very little competition at the same level from non-humanoid intelligence that evolved entirely naturally or without staying roughly on the seed's planned rails.

      :edit: Oh, and bear in mind with all of this, according to canon, the progenitors explored the galaxy and found themselves alone, implying that intelligent life was an incredibly rare thing to evolve entirely naturally. Honestly, that seems like motive enough to me right there for wanting to seed the future of the galaxy to produce more life before going off to whatever their version of a transhuman singularity was.

  I don't really think that Star Trek is a good setting to give the rational treatment to.  Technology was never the point, at least in the best episodes; it's just a way to get people into their predicaments, mostly to examine modern social problems through the lens of some exotic setup.  But in a rational treatment of the series, sensible use of the technology completely warps everything until the rest of the trappings of the series melt away - this might work if technology was ever the point in the first place, but it doesn't work for a series to be mutated so thoroughly by a background detail.

  I think you'd probably get a better exploration of Star Trek's themes - modern social problems in new contexts, with an optimistic take - with something closer to near-future cyberpunk and early pre-singularity metahumans.

  If you're dead set on Star Trek though, I think the only thing that can save the series is if all the homeworlds are run by FAI and most people live in a technological singularity, but nobody has found a version of fun theory that catches quite everyone, so we still have bored adventure seekers off in space.

  OP, this is an amazing idea. I have recently been watching DS9 for the first time since reading HPMOR, and it is completely ruined. The number of just boneheaded mistakes made per episode makes it almost unwatchable. Even so, I grew up with this franchise, and still love it.

  A few of my personal suggestions:

  * Fix the economy via basic income. The Federation is a post scarcity society that provides a basic level of existance, but anything beyond that and you need to get a paying job. The Federation gets around their "no money" rule by providing energy credits. It's not really money, it's a reallocation of reactor time!

  * Pretend the Sol System is average. Much like MOR inserts a new rule of reality, you can play with habitable planets by saying that our solar system is pretty average, and most systems have an "earth like" planet.

  * (Relaited to above) Pretend humans are the average. Earth like species happen to be the solution that nature tends towards. It doesn't have to be correct, just internally consistant. Delete all viable mixed species offspring, but not interspecies romance. After all... it's not unheard of here in the real world.

  * Read some good military science fiction before you start writing. My personal suggestions are The Lost Fleet series (arguably the best depiction of space battles between capital ships), Odyssey One, Democracy's Right, and just for fun Wings of Steele (just the first book).

  Edit: One more.

  * Fix replicators by making them 3D printers that can do certain molecular manipulations. They can build a steak, but not a living cow. They can build a circuit board, but economies of scale make it cheaper to actually use a ship yard to build the *Enterprise*, and a foundry for armor plating.

  The ships would have no physical interior space. They would consist of solid computronium. Anything beamed aboard or brought in through an 'airlock' or 'hangar' would simply be converted to transporter buffer patterns which ran in appropriately shielded sandboxes and were able to interact with each other in a simulation of a ship interior (which wouldn't have to be even remotely consistent with the exterior, Euclidian space, or the laws of physics). No inertial dampers needed, too, unless to hold the ship itself together. Certainly none tuned to avoid turning the crew into strawberry wallpaper during acceleration.

  The exterior designs themselves would be much more symmetrical on a vertical axis. Fewer goose-neck designs and more like the Sovereign or Constellation classes. There's also no real reason they shouldn't be rotationally symmetric to a significant degree. The only reason that could possibly work for the majority of canon Federation designs would be if the warp fields were specifically and deliberately designed to be lopsided for some reason. Even needing to land on a planet shouldn't necessarily mean nacelles way off-center from the center of mass.

  A sphere is actually a *much* better design - smaller target for a given volume/mass, a better-protected core, lower shield-power requirements. I'd like to see one with a tennis-ball curve of phaser banks. Or, given phasers appear to be able to shoot in any direction, why not use the transporter systems to plate the entire exterior surface with phasers wherever and whenever they're needed?

  Physical away teams would be generated as needed, with self-contained intelligence and a permanent subspace comms link to the ship. They could, of course, be entirely human for all intents and purposes, or humanoid robots, or replicas of local sapients, or floating clouds of smart dust.

  With time travel it'd be good to have an increased risk factor. The various methods of time travel they use are pretty unpredictable so have them not always work. As a general matter, roll a 1d20 whenever they time travel, if it hits anything below 18 they all die.

  For the aliens you could have a mix of common ancestor devices and evolution. Have the standard canon races like vulcans and such be humanoid but most races encountered be alien. This was done due to budget constraints, in a literary story you can ignore budgets. Likewise with the suits.

  Holographic stuff and teleportation and replication should be limited- huge energy requirements, a single holodeck is a substantial portion of the ships energy expenditure, teleportation is enormously expensive in energy. The computing requirements for all should also be substantial, if your computer is figuring out firing solutions you don't want to waste power or computing time on teleportation, replication or holodecks.

  On technology, stealing alien technology should be a major thing.

  Per this timeline it might take on average several millennia for the average civilization to develop effective warp travel. Perhaps it's very non intuitive how it works and requires careful analysis of the results of increasingly powerful particle accelerators and very powerful sensory data. Humanity has an advantage with stolen alien technology and their technological advancements are based on those. The development of advanced transwarp and time travel technologies would require extensive study of wormholes and stellar engineering to build transwarp gates which for an average civilization might take more millennia of study.

  Some of the principles behind these things are very simple, hypothetically. A subspace manipulator just requires precise manufacturing to an atomic scale of promethium rotating at 999.07 hertz and a flow of electricity across it at .666V. An engineer who has studied more advanced alien ships may be able to use some alien technology intuitively to do something unusual if they know that at 1432.6 hertz and 0.4242V you can get quadruple the output at the cost of a massive increase in radioactive decay.

  The holodeck probably has to go, because it implies too much about the ship's computer. If the computer can create a mystery story for you to solve, or conjure simulations that can help you solve your problems, it should probably be calling the shots, not Picard.

    ```
    Manufacturing a somewhat randomized fiction using different combinations of existing plot points and story tropes is a long way off from replacing the ship's captain. Moriarty and all other true AI has to go. The holodeck itself can pretty much stay, given a few slight alterations.
