  Warlock's theory is interesting, but Masego's argument is correct, people change all the time. Second Liesse was a traumatic event for Catherine and even now she regrets not being able to stop it, and it's obvious that such an event would change a person. Masego's doubts can be attributed to either winter influence or Cat just being more cautious after losing so much, or even part of the burden of Queenship. It will be interesting to see how she plans to transfer her mantle though.
  ```

  - u/haiku_fornification:
    ```
    I think both Warlock and Tikoloshe incorrectly assume the Mantle has completely replaced Catherine when there's evidence to it simply covering up her human being. When the Saint of Swords damaged Cat's domain, she temporarily returned to her human body. The cases they bring up are the Dead King and the Revenant, whose original bodies were killed in order to achieve apotheosis. This is not the case here and if the mantle was ever usurped or destroyed, I think Cat would go back to being a human rather than being vanquished.
    ```

- u/None:
  ```
  I understand the Warlock's point, and think that generally people are underestimating two things:

  1. The potential of an imperfect copy.  At what level of fidelity is a copy no longer the same thing?  This isn't quite the same thing as the ship of Theseus question, because it would be like if the ship got a redesign every time a new part was added.
  2. That different physical forms may have different effects on thought processes.  The way we store information in our brain and act on it may be quantum, and thus impossible for a normal computer replicate let alone magic or elemental fae powers.

  &#x200B;

  However, we have evidence that this is not the case for Cat.  When the Saint of Swords cut Winter, her body changed into a human again.  This implies that Winter is a layer running on top of her thoughts and body, and something of her true self remains.
  ```

  - u/CouteauBleu:
    ```
    My answer to both these points would be "Who cares?" It's like the teleporter problem all over again.

    Even if current!Catherine has fundamentally different thought processes from past!Catherine, saying that "Catherine is dead" still feels extremely inaccurate by pragmatic metrics. Maybe she's been irreversibly altered by the mantle, but then again she's also been irreversibly altered by letting 10'000s of her countrymen die, becoming Queen, etc.

    If the responsibility of Queenship can make her a radically different person (and it does, she's nothing like Book 1 Cat), but doesn't count as "being dead", then her becoming an imprint on the Winter mantle shouldn't count as "being dead" either, quantum brains or not.
    ```

  - u/lolbifrons:
    ```
    A “normal computer” can emulate a qubit, it’s just slow and computationally expensive.  This to the extent that solving a problem with an emulated shor’s algorithm is slower than just brute forcing it.
    ```

- u/BaggyOz:
  ```
  The transition between subjects is a bit confusing. Am I correctly understanding the reason his parents lied about Keter was because they didn't want Masego to find out enough about apotheosis to attempt it on himself?


  Regardless, given the title of the chapter I think it's very likely that this represents a definite break between Masego and his father, leaving Cat and knowledge as his only allegiances.
  ```

  - u/Zayits:
    ```
    Given that Masego's desire for knowledge is centered around having a world of his own and Neshamah is the only person known to have achieved that, it's not an unreasonable fear.
    ```

- u/Nimelennar:
  ```
  In our world, "is a copy the same as the original" is academic and complicated

  In PGtE, it's simple, because *souls exist*.

  Catherine is still Catherine because Winter is grafted to the same soul she had in the beginning.

  In a world where immortal souls demonstrably exist, I'm confused about how there's even a dispute about whether the same soul transplanted into a different body is the same person.  The soul *is* the person: that's what a soul *is*.

  In our world, where souls (probably) don't exist, sure, there's an argument to be made that an identical copy of you isn't you.  I don't buy the argument, but I recognize it has some validity.  In PGtE, though, whatever entity has Cat's soul *is* Cat, and SnowCat still qualifies.
  ```

  - u/Aegeus:
    ```
    Souls are mutable in this setting.  Mages can remove and dissect them, Masego has done surgery on Cat's more than once.  Winter also has an influence on her personality whenever she draws too deep.

    I think it's fair to ask "Is Cat's soul really the same after all the aftermarket mods she installed?" in the same way that we ask if the Ship of Theseus is really the same ship.
    ```

    - u/Nimelennar:
      ```
      I think we may have different definitions of "soul" here.  A soul is your personality, memories, mind, etc., everything you *are*, given nonphysical existence.

      Obviously, her soul isn't the same as when she started.  But that's, as you pointed out, something Masego already knows all too well.  And, as souls are insubstantial representations of who you are, they're expected to change, as "who you are" changes.

      Unless Winter obliterated her original soul (and I think Masego would have noticed *that*), or the word "soul" means something different in this 'verse, then I think Cat is, by definition, still Cat, because "Cat" is the person who has Cat's soul.
      ```

- u/CaseyAshford:
  ```
  I think that the reveal that the Warlock and likely most Praesi do not believe that the existence after death is a continuation of the self that exists in Creation makes a lot of sense considering that they will almost certainly end up in Hell. This seems like a logical way to explain why the followers of the Evil Gods are not particularly concerned with the  fact that their lifestyle would inevitably end with them suffering eternally in the Hells.
  ```

  - u/Frommerman:
    ```
    The existence of the Serenity casts doubt upon the whole "limitless torment" thing as well. Some of the Hells are certainly like that, but we don't know about all of them.

    Also, way back when Cat entered the Tower for the first time it was mentioned that demons can destroy souls entirely. The likelihood that any given soul in a Hell which ever contains demons gets eaten approaches one over infinite time, so it's really asymptotically limited torment.
    ```

- u/Agnoman:
  ```
  So we've got the first half of the chapter from Warlock's side, which is filled with a lot of magical jargon.

  I'm not a huge fan of that, because a lot of what's said just comes off as noise and doesn't really help enumerate the limits of our characters. Although there were some interesting pieces amongst all this, like how wards cannot be placed over water, the focuses of Ashuran sorcery,some history, and a lot of detail about how Thalassina's defences function (after nearly 2000 words of that, I'm assuming that this city is going to be important moving forward).

  Then there's Masego's half, which is dominated by talks about secrets and apotheosis.

  I feel like Tikoloshe and Wekesa had a pretty damn good reason for keeping the secret they did (if they were telling the truth, which we have to question because Praesi), namely preventing Masego from turning himself into an undead zombie and suffering (what they consider to be) personality death. Like, Masego talks about how much he's grown since leaving his parents, but what he doesn't mention is how much room he had to grow. You couldn't reasonably say that the Apprentice when we first met him was someone who could be trusted to be responsible with some of the most dangerous knowledge around. He was a kid, and it was his parents job to protect him as best they knew how.

  As to Cat and the ego death, I thought that was an interesting twist. There's been something different about Cat this book, which has been frustrating me a little, so an explanation for that is appreciated. For whether she's "gone" or not I figure people are going to have different definitions of personhood, and thus different answers to this question, but my take on it is that Cat is no longer Cat. She's something very close, sure, but if she has different values, is making different choices, and can't grow or change in the same way then she's not the same person on a static or dynamic measure.
  ```

  - u/IgnatiusFlamel:
    ```
    Interesting analysis. I agree with most of it (though I like the jargon); but the talk between Masego & his parents is interesting in multiple ways:

    1) It displays a struggle between autonomy(of Masego) and (benevolent) guardianship(of his parents towards Masego)


    2) It displays the expectations Masego still has towards his parents;
    he expects them to act in a certain way 

    (IF you raised me to fear nothing but ignorance, THEN you shouldn't act against this value you have instilled in me; e.g. you should never keep secrets from me that I want to learn)


    3) Masego still fails to understand both the motivations of his parents and their freedom to choose and act contrary to his expectations of them -> this is why is is feeling "betrayed" and hurt


    4) Tikoloshe & Wekesa, however, have underestimated Masego's desire to learn and strength of character; the Time spent with Cat & the Woe have given Masego the strength to stand up for himself even against his parents
    (He also has never encountered "limits" from their parenting before, which is why this matter is a BIG DEAL to him)


    Finally, the chapter ends with "Arc words" from Masego - just as Black's **I do not kneel**, Catherine's **Justifications matter only to the just**, Masego has found his voice: **I do not flinch**.


    And that is pretty awesome.
    ```

    - u/Agnoman:
      ```
      > **Justifications matter only to the just**

      Speaking of, whatever happened to that?

      The last time that was mentioned in the story was chapter 61 which was a *rejection* of the phrase, both because of it's Evilness and because even Cat doesn't think she holds to it. The time before that was chapter 1, where Hakram threw it back at her, and she rejected it there as well. The last time she invoked the words and meant them was book 2, which is how many hundred thousand words ago?

      Even outside of the specific phrase, Cat is constantly justifying herself and questioning the justifications of others - it's clearly very important to her. This has even been directly pointed out to her a few times.
      ```

      - u/CouteauBleu:
        ```
        On the other hand, she never really believed them in the first place.

        It was always "What the hells am I doing? Should I be doing this? Fuck it, I'm doing it anyway". My biggest disappointment with Catherine is that she keeps hinting at utilitarianism, but never self-actualizes as an utilitarian.
        ```

        - u/Agnoman:
          ```
          Fair point. It's sort of a strange angel-defeating catchphrase for someone who cares an awful lot about justifications when you look at it.
          ```

          - u/JustLookingToHelp:
            ```
            It can be taken another way.  The logical flow most people read her words as is:

            IF NOT "Just" THEN NOT "justifications matter"

            But you can take the inverse:

            IF "Justifications matter" THEN "Just"

            Which suggests that because Cat *does* seek justifications for most of her actions, she's enacting her own kind of justice.
            ```

            - u/IgnatiusFlamel:
              ```
              this double-meaning of the phrase actually describes Catherine's struggle with morality and her search for "decent behavior" as opposed to "Good" as presented by heroes/angels and "Stupid/megalomanic evil" as presented by oldschool villains.


              She rejects both of these stances, yet wants to avoid becoming a complete monster / completely willful...

              An eventual "redemption" arc could be foreshadowed in her Arc words.
              ```

            - u/Agnoman:
              ```
              But that doesn't work at all with how the phrase was introduced.


              Cat first said it in Book One, right after fulling embracing her role as a villain and deciding she was okay with being on the side of Evil. It was meant to be an answer to Will's question ("how can you possibly justify working for these Tyrants?"), and it was an answer strong enough for her name, which had left her at the time, to come back out to play.

              The next time she mentioned it was her deciding it didn't matter whether she was morally right after committing murder.

              Then we get to the big one (and the last time the words aren't subverted), where the Heavens themselves demand contrition and justification  for her actions, and when she tells them "justifications only matter to the just", they flinch.

              Saying that this whole time the phrase meant precisely the opposite of what Cat meant kind of robs this events of their weight. And they had a huge weight, these words carried her through pivotal events.

              A response to "you need to justify the terrible things you've done and will do" with "yes, justification are quite important" doesn't really work.
              ```

              - u/Frommerman:
                ```
                Why would the Heavens flinch when told that justifications only matter to the just if they know themselves to be just? It would be tautological to them. "Why yes, justifications matter to us because we are the embodiment of Justice, thanks for stating the blindingly obvious." They would have just kept on with the forced brainwashing because being the embodiment of justice means that no spoken justifications are even required.

                But that's not what they are. The Gods Above are no more just than the Gods Below, and the Choir of Contrition *know* that. When Cat says justifications only matter to the just, she's *mocking* them. "Oh, you want me to justify myself? Is that right? Well, if you want my justifications, I'll have yours first!" They flinched because they had no answer to that. Justice is an alien concept to them, just as love, and hope, and "not brainwashing everyone in a 49 mile radius just by existing for a few seconds" are. Even the Choir of Justice is arguably unjust, as it creates monsters who kill whenever a coin comes up tails and who tolerate monsters like Tariq.

                The concept of justice appears, in the Guideverse, to be entirely manmade. Neither Above nor Below really champion it. That is the true meaning of Cat's motto, it seems. If justice only comes from humanity, then the Gods must be defied no matter the costs. Justifications only matter to the Just, and if only we are Just, then we only need to justify ourselves to ourselves.
                ```

                - u/Agnoman:
                  ```
                  >When Cat says justifications only matter to the just, she's mocking them. "Oh, you want me to justify myself? Is that right? Well, if you want my justifications, I'll have yours first!"

                  She really wasn't though. We saw what that phrase was supposed to mean on three separate occasions. Again, when it was set up before the climax of book 2, Cat was using the phrase to tell herself she was unconcerned with whether she was morally justified in killing a person.

                  There's not really evidence that the entire time there was a secret meaning unbeknown to Cat herself, and there would be issues if there were.

                  >But that's not what they are. The Gods Above are no more just than the Gods Below

                  Not according to EE:

                  >I don’t recall ever stating that. The Gods Above and Below do roughly correspond to “lower case” good and evil, as far as entities that far removed from mortals can be understood. That neither side of the equation intervenes directly means there’s a lot of room for interpretation in the respective philosophies they preach, but the bare bones are there.

                  .

                  >"not brainwashing everyone in a 49 mile radius just by existing for a few seconds" are. Even the Choir of Justice is arguably unjust, as it creates monsters who kill whenever a coin comes up tails and who tolerate monsters like Tariq.

                  The Angels promote extremism because they have an extreme perspective. Look at Hanno's extra chapter:

                  >They showed him, then. What it was they saw


                  >The endless shifting tapestry that was all the decisions that were made and could be. The impossible lay of action and consequence, of motive and result. It was too much. It was too much for him to see, to understand. The boy screamed, felt all that he was fray as he glimpsed a whole he had never been meant to glimpse. The sum of all that was and would be, the culmination of endless paths. Hanno felt feathered wings envelop him, cold arms of metal embrace him closely. He was blind, now, and had never felt more blessed.

                  The angels have extreme judgements, because they have no need for moderation when they can just make calls based off of a perfect understanding of everything. Is it alien and inhuman? Definitely. But they themselves are alien and inhuman - that's the point and that's why Hanno defers to them in the first place. It's an Omniscient Morality License played disturbingly straight.

    Sorcery in this work is basically a plot device that can be whatever the plot needs at the time.
    ```

    - u/Agnoman:
      ```
      Basically.

      I just struggle a little bit with that, because there's no real way of knowing what problems it can or can't solve trivially, and it's used often enough that it can be a bit of a deus ex machina.

      Plus we end up with chapters like this one, where half of it is an essay about magic which ultimately doesn't  have any real impact upon our understanding of the main magic users at all. Personally I'm not a huge fan of that, if you couldn't tell.
      ```

      - u/CouteauBleu:
        ```
        I feel the story does an okay job of conveying what problems sorcery can or cannot solve trivially. The general idea is, if you put X amount of sorcery into a thing, then the other guy needs X amount of sorcery to counter it. The specifics are story-dependent.
        ```

        - u/Agnoman:
          ```
          >The general idea is, if you put X amount of sorcery into a thing, then the other guy needs X amount of sorcery to counter it

          This would be useful if the concerns about magic's capabilities centred around countering other magic. This is not the case.

          It's also not particularly true? There have been plenty of times where skill and weird unexplained magical techniques are the deciding factors in sorcererous contests. Warlock vs Witch of the Woods, for one example.

          >The specifics are story-dependent.

          Not really? The vast majority of mages aren't Named. And stories don't seem to influence the laws of physics/magic so much as they empower Named or bend coincidence. I think this logic also shifts the problem; the *story* itself is often ill-defined. But that's a whole other issue.
          ```

  - u/Zayits:
    ```
    Well, I'd say that the jargon at least fleshes out what to expect so EE can work with those expectations. It also showcases differences in perspective and focus of Wekesa and Hierophant.
    ```

    - u/Agnoman:
      ```
      At the same time, lots of the rules of sorcery introduced thus far were brought up in the context of the characters  breaking those rules (often with Named shenanigans).

      And discussing the relative advantages between Praesi Trismegistan, Procerean Jaquinite, Miezan Petronian, Gigantes Ligurian, Baalite/Ashuran Sabrathan, amongst others, doesn't help distinguish between what Hierophant or Warlock can or can't do when we know they're deeply familiar with all of these fields. I'm curious if you can tie their perspectives and focuses to these different theories, because I sure can't.
      ```

      - u/Frommerman:
        ```
        You don't really need to know those things, though. I consider them window-dressing for the much more important and interesting character interactions in this chapter. You don't need to know exactly what the words mean to understand that Warlock and Heirophant disdain foreign magical systems for their lack of scientific rigor and lackluster feats.
        ```

        - u/Agnoman:
          ```
          No, but after multiple essays about how magic works, I'd like to at least have an idea of the limits of our main magic users. It's part of a broader issue where, without really knowing the limits of magic ahead of time, it can be a bit deus ex machina-ish when it's used to resolve conflicts and solve problems.

          Take, say, food shortages in Callow. This is a problem that's we've been building up to for a long while. Can Masego solve it, help in a limited way, or is he powerless here? We have no real idea where he falls on the spectrum here. Cat thought about asking him help with the devastation of southern Callow's farmlands, but we never saw that conversation or what resulted from it. 

          Can he help out? How much can he help out? What would the costs of that help look like (if any)? Does he have things he could do that he hasn't mentioned because he doesn't really care about people starving? How concerned should we be about this situation, if the magical demigod can potentially pull a solution out of nowhere?

          There are so many questions here, and no real way of knowing what the answers are short of waiting for an answer to be given after the fact. And this is just one example.
          ```

    I liked the magical jargon, but mostly because it was just thinly-veiled character work, and damn good character work at that.

        The concept of the Ship of Theseus has been thrown around, but check out the Moravec procedure.

        How so? One could argue that every time you go to sleep there is a break in consciousness, and as such the person who wakes up is fundamentally different. Following your chain of logic, going to sleep would be equivalent to killing ones-self, which in my opinion is ludicrous.


        By definition, if two things are identical, they are the same. I guess a counter argument would be that the difference comes from their *position* (referencing how electrons are all fundamentally the same, yet we know that there is more than one electron in the universe), but that ultimately feeds into the initial point I made. If you get drugged and moved 20 miles while you sleep, and wake up in a different position than you normally would be, you're still you. 


        There's an argument to be made if there's more than one *you* existing at a time, but even then I'd argue that they are both you, just different instances. (Again, electrons). These "yous" can go on to do and be different things, while still fundamentally being you.

          Your original body will be killed in the process.

              >I recognize that I'm an outlier

              I do believe you are. I wonder where do you draw the line? Everybody has one, only it's at different points for different people.

              For example, what if there was a break in consciousness? If the original walked out of the machine alive and had to be shot in the head, while the copy would have all the memories up to exiting the machine but nothing after that?


              How long of a break is acceptable?

                It's a bit of a fuzzy line. The amount of time necessary for the two of our utility functions to vary significantly. As I am now, I would be perfectly happy to take a bullet for myself if it earned other me utility.

                I would put the time in terms of decisions, after around 5 'major' (actively choosing something rather than subconsciously) decisions I feel we would diverge enough to be considered different people. At that point it would be murder.

                  Would you think of it like a binary thing - it's either 'murder' or not - or a continuous thing - after each decision it is more morally bad to kill them?

                    That's a really good question. Honestly, I'm not sure. I lean more towards it being binary though. 

                    The mental imagery I have is two notes, moving out of sync with each other until suddenly they're no longer in unison. There *is* a change as the pitches shift, but it doesn't reaaally matter until the difference is large enough to be noticeable, at which point it's very noticeable. Does that make sense?

                If the "original" must be murdered, then the problem with this procedure is with the murder, not the duplication. If the machine needs to destroy the original to create the duplicate, however, it's just a teleporter.

          Sure, I agree that there's no fundamental difference between one and the other, except that they're still two separate people. If one of them dies, he's no less dead for there being a second one.

        The universe disagrees with you on this one. It can't distinguish between identical particles and atoms: one arrangement with the same properties is the same as all others. A copy of you made right now has the exact same right to call itself the original as the singular you which currently exists because the universe cannot tell the difference. To say otherwise is to say that the specific arrangement of atoms which currently contains you is somehow unique from all of the other possible arrangements which could do so. This would imply that you cease to exist every planck-second as particles shift and waveforms collapse.

        You can't have it both ways. You cannot self-consistently say that all past versions of you are you, and also that the existence of a second you implies that one of them is not you. All past versions are exactly like copies of you, made in a different place, and reacting in different ways, to the way you would right now. They're even *less* like you than what we propose, even. The copy would be exactly as you are now, while no past version of you can claim the same.

        Ultimately, you are not your body or your brain. You are a pattern which is currently supported on those media. If you aren't, it implies that the bundle of matter which currently contains you has some unique, uncopiable you-ness about it. Saying that a copy of you is not you implies that you believe in souls. It implies that something metaphysical confers you-ness upon the universe, rather than you-ness being contained entirely within the material realm. Perhaps you are not a materialist. That would allow you to continue to believe as you do. But be warned: rejecting a hypothesis which has thus far been confirmed by every single test ever devised requires something more than logic.

        It requires faith.

        Do you have faith in your own singularity?

          I'm not saying that a perfect clone wouldn't be 'me,' in the sense of having the same identity, I'm saying it wouldn't be 'me' as in it's a different person altogether despite the similarity in body and mind. If it could exist at the same time as you, it isn't you.

            Continuity of consciousness is a pernicious illusion. If we really believed we had it, we would mourn everyone who went under anesthesia as having died, as the process makes it temporarily impossible for the brain to support consciousness. If you have ever gone under, no mind which could appreciably have been called yours existed until you woke. A complete interruption.

            Therefore, since the universe cannot tell the difference between two copies of me, and because we already ignore a process which completely turns us off temporarily, the fact that this situation is only strange by the number of extant mes temporarily increasing rather than decreasing is irrelevant. The outcome is the same.

                      Sleep is a little different. You might consider deep sleep an interruption, but you are still you while dreaming. Furthermore, the brain is still looking for serious, immediate threats like having been stabbed or very loud noises, and can rouse itself if those occur. Sleep is a decreased state of consciousness, to be sure, but someone sufficiently determined to believe in personal singularity could, not unreasonably, hold that sleep-them also qualifies as them for their purposes.

                      Anesthesia, on the other hand, induces a state where all the parts of the brain that are supposed to fire in unison instead fire in a slow, seconds-long wave moving from the front of the brain to the back. It is utterly unlike anything you find in normal operation. Furthermore, people under anesthesia often report going to sleep and then immediately waking in recovery with no percieved time gap. You still feel like time has passed while sleeping (although less of it) because the part of the brain which tracks the passage of time doesn't completely shut off during sleep. Anesthesia interrupts that as well, hence the percieved teleportation.

        Thing is there is a difference. In the dead kings case and others they had to die, thus destroying the continuity of their mind. In a world where souls are an undisputed fact, that likely makes them copies rather than the original. 

        However Cat never did that. Her continuity has been preserved. It has also been demonstrated that she still has a soul, and at least Masego has seen it and still believes it to be her original, however mangled. As such she is no copy, but mearly an evolution of the original.

    Definitely a Ship of Theseus situation.

    But I disagree, a man is more than a sum of his parts, especially in a world with Roles. Even in real life, our cells are constantly replaced over years with frequent breaks in consciousness yet we remain ourselves. Catherine will only "die" between her mortal life and her new life as a winter abomination if such a death had made her utterly inconsistent with the way she was before, and as a reader I see no such sign.

    Or to frame it another way, we are different from one instance to the next, changed from experience and environment. Every journey would thus never be finished, as one would return as a different person. A man going to sleep at night would be a different man when he wakes at dawn. He will thus die uncountable number of deaths between cradle to grave, especially if he seeks out life-changing experiences. The question itself is a meaningless pursuit.

      >Definitely a Ship of Theseus situation.

      Not quite how I see it. Cat's situation would only be analogous to the Ship of Theseus if instead of being slowly replaced, the ship had been burned down in a single night and Theseus had then gone and bought a new boat that was exactly the same. The question of 'is this a different ship,' seems rather easy to answer when the ashes of the old ship are still settling into the silt of the harbor.
      ```

      - u/Rice_22:
        ```
        But there isn't any leftover of old Catherine after apotheosis, though. Not even ashes.

        And burning down is still a transformation of the base material, from wood to energy-spent ashes. The text keeps referring to how her body is now made of Winter. So more replacement for every single mortal part of her with magic rather than buying a new MC from the MC store.

        It's more like the ship got set on fire but it had a bunch of grey goo stored in the cargo hold which the fire let loose and now tehre's a ship made of nanomachiens floating in the harbor.
