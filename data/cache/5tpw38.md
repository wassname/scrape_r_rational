  Is there actually any choice in the game? If it's just rolling dice then you have no real choice.        

  I suppose if the first roll wasn't too bad (but still let you know that the game was for real) then you could just live your life normally. Study a bunch of current tech as the decades progress, then finish the game and come back with knowledge decades ahead of your time.             
  Sort of like a time loop except extremely dangerous.
