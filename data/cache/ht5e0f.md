## Should I return to reading Worth the Candle?

### Post:

I absolutely loved WtC for 100 chapters or so. However, I eventually dropped it for a specific reason. I'm wondering if anyone would be willing to advise me on whether that reason was really true, or if the story takes a turn and does something different. Spoilers incoming:

>!As the story goes on, the plot driver increasingly becomes narrative theory. Juniper believes that the narrative needs to escalate in a specific way: as he becomes more powerful, the encounters and challenges will also become more powerful, at the exact level required to provide a serious, potentially unwinnable situation. Furthermore, he'll experience personal losses, in his relationships, that are more or less inevitable. There's more to it than that, but I think that's a decent summary. !<

>!My issue with this is that it made the story feel really, really predictable. True, I didn't know exactly what wacky event or villain would pop up next. But I knew the narrative shape of it -- because Juniper seemed to be correct in his narrative theory, which he endlessly expounded and agonized over in between encounters. It began to feel like Shakespearean tragedy -- knowing that tragedy is coming and helpless to really do anything about it -- which largely doesn't interest me.!<

Anyway, to be clear it's a great story, top 10 in the genre IMO, I just got exhausted by the feeling it gave me as a reader. I already tried picking it back up once and read up to the chapters with >!Mome Rath!<, but those chapters only further confirmed what I was feeling about the story. I want to read more if it changes, though.

  The next arc kinda maxes out what you are describing, but the latest published arc published (ending chapter 205) pays it off really well and dramatically changes things. I'm looking forward to the next arc, I think the characters are developing in novel ways.

      I would argue that the entire story is set up to be a subversion of "narrative theory", of course to subvert it, the story has to set it up first!
      ```

      - u/vimefer:
        ```
        That's been my hope too, with Juniper's belief in how the narrative theory "ought to work" being the actual reason why it is currently verifying, all because the DM makes the world work the way the PC expects it should work ; and >!this being a future point that Juniper and gang have to disprove to Arthur once they eventually meet him - so that Arthur realizes his being trapped by narrative was all his own doing in the first place.!<

  "top 10 in the genre", wow what weighty praise lol


  Edit: To answer your question though, for a while WtC was honestly getting a little too depressing and feeling a bit aimless to me but I've been in love with the story again as of the last couple of releases.

    Worth the Candle is at absolute worst the second best story ever posted to this subreddit.
    ```

    - u/assbutter9:
      ```
      On this subreddit I'd say it's #1 and it's honestly not that close. 

      Just the quality of the writing in general puts it head and shoulders above anything else in this genre.

        I like Worm more but I see mixed opinions on whether or not it belongs here.

        Nothing else is close to those, though. PGtE is the next closest and is very good, but it's still a step behind.

          >Nothing else is close to those, though

          Guess everyone has already forgotten about Mother of Learning :/ I'm pretty sure that fic is the reason a lot of people found out this sub.
          ```

        - u/cstmorr:
          ```
          Oof, Worm's author is offender #1 when it comes to writing predictable challenges that scale to exceed the power of the characters by the precise amount needed to be nearly impossible. He's gotten worse about it over time, too. I tried to start Ward a couple weeks ago and had to nope out after the first fight, because it was just a frustrating, shitty mess of "ooh I'm slightly too strong for you".

          I actually felt like WtC was partially based on wanting to call out the narrative theory cycle that produces that kind of stuff. And that was even fun, until it went on for too long.
          ```

          - u/assbutter9:
            ```
            ....honestly not sure what you're looking for buddy. Don't think your kind of story really exists, I literally never had that impression a single time reading worm/ward. Pretty sure you got this idea in your head and now you see it everywhere.
            ```

            - u/cstmorr:
              ```
              I loved Worm, actually. I got that idea from Pact, and then from Twig. Each seemed to progressively intensify the worse parts of the plotting style that produced Worm, although the ideas and worldbuilding were still great. Did you read those two?
              ```

              - u/assbutter9:
                ```
                I can actually absolutely see that in Pact, 100%. I loved Twig though and don't see what you mean there, I think it's Wildbow's best work.
                ```

                - u/cstmorr:
                  ```
                  Oh, I looooooooved the worldbuilding in Twig. It's an amazing premise that nobody else has succeeded with the same way. I don't mean to give the impression that I hated the story, I ate up most of it. But every single fight or emergency, they only escaped by the skin of their teeth, and the escalating pattern ultimately felt predictable for me. That's not a pattern I see in all fictions, or even most.
                  ```

      - u/PastafarianGames:
        ```
        While WtC is indeed very good, I think it's a reach to call it head and shoulders above APGtE or some of the short stories people have written. I mean, Scott Alexander has written some stuff that stands just as tall as WtC.
        ```

        - u/assbutter9:
          ```
          Oh I was mostly talking about the litrpg genre in general, where nothing is really close to the same league as WtC. 

          I didn't know APGtE really got posted here anymore but if we're counting that I'd rate it as a reasonably close #2 to WtC, I'm a big fan.
          ```

          - u/PastafarianGames:
            ```
            Yeah, most of the LitRPG genre is absolute dross, I'll grant you that. The first book in Andrew Rowe's Arcane Ascension series was quite good, but it's not a free web serial so it's not really the kind of thing this subreddit goes for.
            ```

          - u/None:
            ```
            The WanderingInn is really good. Not particularly rational and unfortunately the first book is the weakest. But IMO more enjoyable than WTC which is probably my second favorite litrpg.
            ```

            - u/assbutter9:
              ```
              I absolutely love The Wandering Inn, it's currently my favorite web serial and I'm a patreon supporter who looks forward to every release.

              I honestly don't really consider it part of the LitRPG genre anymore though, it has basically just become a fantasy series with a power system.
              ```

  - u/cstmorr:
    ```
    Just personal opinion obviously :) But I feel like 90% of the competition is utter schlock, and I'm not even referring to the wish fulfillment stuff -- just poorly written LitRPG that utterly fails to justify its worldbuilding. I admire WtC for the high effort attempt at rationality, heh.

    5 seconds later edit: oh you were probably being sarcastic. facepalm.
    ```

    - u/assbutter9:
      ```
      Lol yes I was absolutely being sarcastic. Compared to any other litrpg that exists WtC is a masterpiece. It's the only one I've ever read with genuinely quality writing and a fully realized world. Everything else in the genre is borderline gutter-tier garbage.
      ```

      - u/cstmorr:
        ```
        Eh, I wouldn't call everything else garbage, not by a long shot. I think LitRPG is actually much harder to rationalize and turn into a believable story than the broader fantasy genre, because it's inherently about something trivial (a game) that has no reasonable purpose for existing (especially looking at the grimderp System Apocalypse stories here).

        WtC kind of slides around that criticism by acknowledging that the world is fucking ridiculous and utterly broken, and that the reason for that is that it's a poorly cobbled together collection of ideas from a single person, and also only exists to antagonize that same person. In other words, it didn't find a "solution" for the challenge facing the genre as a whole, it just created a very specific solution for itself -- and that solution still has the potential to fall apart when the story reveals the full justification for it.

        Some other stories are trying to create fully-fledged worlds that matter for more than a single character and/or provide a solution that would work for the whole genre, and I think that's worth points for effort, and mega points for success, if any should actually succeed.

        ... goddamnit I word too much.
        ```

        - u/assbutter9:
          ```
          Nah, every single LitRPG out there right now is written in a terrible, stilted, amateurish style. I've tried basically every single popular one and that is what always ruins them for me. 

          It isn't a matter of making the plot more rational or anything like that, it's just the fact that for 99% of them they are the authors first work in any genre. And it shows.
          ```

          - u/cstmorr:
            ```
            That's true in general. But I also think the average quality of new stories has risen over the past year. Compare something like Seaborn or the Menocht Loop to the top new fictions from 2-3 years ago on Royalroad and I think you'd agree they don't deserve to be put in the same bucket, even if you still don't like the two I named.
            ```

            - u/assbutter9:
              ```
              For sure I can agree with that, stuff like Delve, while not actually "good" is 10000x better than some of the older stuff that was almost unanimously praised at the time. The authors who have been at it a little while have been getting better and better too. 

              For example, The Wandering Inn was barely readable to me at first and I dropped it like 5 times during the first couple arcs but I think it's genuinely good now, I look forward to the releases every week. Practical Guide to Evil was really roughly written at first too and I love that one now as well. For both of those though, Wandering Inn started off LitRPG and is pretty much just a fantasy story now, and Practical guide was always just fantasy. The litrpg genre is getting better but still just really rough.
              ```

              - u/cstmorr:
                ```
                The Wandering Inn started off as quite unremarkable, even boring / frustrating, but it's my absolute favorite now. I'm basing that solely off arcs 6 and 7, but I think it's fair to consider the latest 2 million words of a 5 million word fiction. The problem is how a new reader would get into it. Skimming? That's unique to webfic; no traditional fantasy author ever had to worry about spending their entire career on one ongoing story, and they all have notoriously bad stories / series that got buried under new stuff (e.g. Glen Cook's Dread Empire versus the Black Company).

                Similarly to TWI, I tried PGtE and bounced out early on, but never gave it another chance. We've been arguing all through this thread but I suspect we're actually seem pretty similar in terms of taste, so I guess I'm going to pull up my socks and give it a real try. Thanks (if I don't hate it).
                ```

                - u/assbutter9:
                  ```
                  Yeah The Wandering Inn is wonderful now, it's just like a smooth, addicting read every chapter. There aren't many serials out right now that scratch the same itch. It's long-winded but I honestly prefer that in a serial. The author is insane no idea how she churns out 40-60k words a week this consistently. 

                  But yeaaah I've never been able to recommend it to a friend lol. "Just lightly read/skim the first 1 million words and it gets great I swear!" Not the best sell. 

                  And yeah I'm pretty convinced our taste is very similar, hope you didn't get the impression I was arguing angrily or anything, just a good discussion. I would thoroughly recommend PGtE, it's the same situation as Wandering Inn where the first 1/2 arcs are very mediocre but it gets much better. I think I've heard English isn't the authors first language and if true it makes perfect sense, it becomes more and more fluid as it goes. 

                  Won't say it's my favorite or the best web serial out there but it's very good and worth reading if you like fantasy.

                  I sing the praises of PGtE every chance I get lately. Especially in the latest 2 arcs I honestly feel it's some of the best written stuff out there. Its politics, especially, have been incredible lately, and that's not only hard to write but hard to make fun to read.

                    Push through several books worth of material to get to the good stuff? ... yeah, it won't be my first time. Challenge accepted.

                      Good luck! For what it's worth I recall thoroughly enjoying books 3 and 4, though I suspect from your discussions my standards aren't quite as high as yours and assbutter's. I also liked 1 and 2 but it's been too long for me to recall criticisms clearly.

                  Gotta chime in that you need to read Practical. The first arc is a little slow, but particularly from book 2 onward it's absolutely on another level compared to anything else on TWF or on Royal Road. From your comment I may need to give Wandering Inn a 3rd try, I kept getting stopped at the first or second chapter. Honestly it being insanely long is a plus for me, I keep knocking out million word stories in a week and as long as I know it gets better I'll probably stick it out. The writing in the first chapter and a half is almost painfully stilted though.
                  ```

                  - u/cstmorr:
                    ```
                    TWI is becoming a weird anomaly. The author keeps getting better, even as the story keeps getting larger and larger. I think arc 7, the latest, is by far the best. It's just inhuman to not get burned out, run out of ideas, or lose the plot after 5 million words. 

                    But, it's a long haul to reach the very best material. My advice: if a particular character annoys you, just skip their sections. A lot of readers apparently do that for characters they find disagreeable or morally objectionable.

                Totally agree about the wandering inn. It started out as a weird little 4/10 story but now it's the height of my day whenever a new chapter comes out. Mostly the the negative things i see from other readers is that it's too long or that pirateaba changes character perspectives too often. But all the people that say that just don't get the story or the format it feels like. It's a huge story and it's gonna take years and years to tell it properly. I read all the popular stories on here and love the wandering inn as well. Not because it's rational but because it's just good.

                Im not an english speaker and I was a little drunk but this looks fine to me. I had to give TWI some love.
                ```

  ```
  Honestly, I kind of like the narrative thing, because we're never *entirely* sure whether it's actually true, or just something Juniper is seeing due to his own background. Maybe Aerb does run on Joon-style narrative. But maybe it runs on Arthur-style narrative, which is subtly different. Or maybe it's neither; it's just that Joon and Arthur came close to getting the framework right.

  Essentially, we still don't know if there are underlying frameworks that Joon is missing entirely, which could become problematic. He seems to have found something which is broadly correct, but the world is stuffed to the gills with weird shit that can suddenly leap out and be horrifying. We already know that there are memetic agents, memory-wipers, and ways to alter people fundamentally. How do we know that such things didn't happen to Arthur - and might have *already happened* to Joon and co?

- u/theLastHaruspex:
  ```
  This is really funny. I think the reason you dropped the fic-- that it's getting too predictable, I think that's exactly what the author is going for 😂

  I may be wrong, of course. It just struck me that I do that kind of thing all the time :)
  ```

  - u/cstmorr:
    ```
    Yeah, I totally agree. That's what made me give up hope -- because I think the author is competent and he'll succeed at what he's trying to do :P
    ```

    - u/Mason-B:
      ```
      I think he is going for it as well, but I think he is doing it to subvert it.

      The way I view it >!is that it was necessary for the narrative theory to be addressed in character due to the plot. But further than that I think it's a predictable sequence for a little while because the author is trying to make sure we "get" how the meta-narrative system works (kind of like PGtE, if you've ever read that, but in a more acknowledged way).!<

      I'm not quite sure when you stopped, >!but after it's established to an extent the author begins to subvert it and play with it. Because now that the characters are aware of it, it's no longer a useful way to predict what happens sort of thing. If I knew when you stopped and what specific parts you took issue with I might be able to better answer if it gets subverted or not.!<
