  Based on the responses on the last post, I'm going to keep on posting each one as it comes out.

    I just want to agree with /u/SaberToothedRock and let you know that these posts are useful. I'd probably not remember to look at the new releases if it weren't for you.

    I wish they had an RSS or email update feature that alerted you when the new chapters were released.

      They have an RSS for the whole site, which is how I find out about it. It is definitely a bit annoying to get RSS alerts primarily about stuff that I don't care about though.

        Your sacrifice is appreciated.

        Yeah I knew that actually. I didn't sign up for it for exactly that reason. Too much clutter.

            Thanks! This site is pretty useful. It took some fiddling to figure out exactly how to format things, but I was able to create a feed that displays the chapters.

    Please do, I would never have found this awesome manga if it were not for your weekly posts as I don't visit this sub all that often.

  It's starting to really creep me out the way they do such unsympathetic drawings of Mama's black helper. It's not necessarily a racist thing, but it seems likely given how comparatively flattering the drawings of Mama herself are (unless, as some have speculated, they're setting Mama up to be an unexpected heroine).

  Look at [page 4](http://mangastream.com/r/neverland/008/3701/4) for example. [Page 19](http://mangastream.com/r/neverland/008/3701/19) is also quite extreme, but there she's at least doing something sinister.

  They have previously drawn her in a more natural way, but she's the only character that's had these strangely dehumanising moments when she's being villainous. Strange as it sounds, even the demons are drawn with traditional, flattering pespective.

    I think you're judging the whole thing a bit prematurely. I think the reason she looks unflatteringly is more because of her intentions and motivations. The demons want food, the kids are just a farm to them. The woman is trying to not only kill the children by sending them off to the demons, but also upend mama at the same time. It may not be just because of Japanese perceptions of Black people, but also to show that the helper is evil in more ways than either mama or the demons. It may even be in the way 

    That said, manga and anime in general haven't done flattering representations of black people for a long time (ever?), so you may be accurate in your perceptions.

      The black characters in Eureka 7 are pretty normal looking. But that's the only example I can think of off the top of my head. There really aren't a lot of black characters in anime to begin with.

  Honestly, even with the AssClass training montage, I seriously doubt that more than a dozen kids will escape, Trio included. 

  Art took a dip, which is understandable, not every week is a good week. Emma continues to be 'the heart' (and that's being generous, she's slowly becoming just a mhm machine while Norman and Ray get to have chessmaster moments) which is jarring, since the first chapter showed us she's consistently top scoring, just as the guys.

  Crone is still creepy and has a punchable face.

  Also.. did Mama just casually bug Emma? Fixing her collar my ass. 

  I do wonder how this will play out. The chances are ridiculously stacked against the kids. Unless Mama makes a heel face turn, I don't know how believable the escape seems.

  Side note, TPN is fourth in this weeks Jump, so we're not in danger of losing this gem. It's nice to see some compelling plots in Jumps again.

    She was checking to make sure they hadn't removed or tampered with the tracker that was already there.

    That makes sense to me, because in a lot of stories, it can be very difficult to explain what's going on to the reader without having the characters talk about incredibly obvious things. To get around this problem, authors use a character who know nothing as an audience surrogate which is Emma in this case. So by explaining things to Emma, the audience can understand what's happening.

    An example of a badly done version is in science fiction stories where someone talks about widely known futuristic technology which is odd, because everyone in the setting should already know about it.

    Oh man, I hope not, allthough it would make sense... If mama has access to mics, the kids are so screwed.
