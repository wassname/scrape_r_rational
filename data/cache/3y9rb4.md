  This is frankly a *much* better ending than the actual one for BSG.

  ```
  It's caught my interest.

  Do I need to know the source material to appreciate this?

  Eh, I'll keep reading, but treat it like *in media res.*

    The only source material I felt like looking up was [Spoilers](#s "some of the Trek stuff about Apollo").

- u/Marthinwurer:
  ```
  Very good - I just finished. I have not watched either series, and was greatly entertained. I would definitely recommend this fic to others.
  ```
