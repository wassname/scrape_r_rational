## Munchkin the green pill.

### Post:

I'm sure everyone's familiar with this story by now:

http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/06/02/and-i-show-you-how-deep-the-rabbit-hole-goes/

The green pill guy in the story is particularly bad about using pill powers. Now, the green pill isn't one that's super effective (I was all over the black pill myself) but surely there's a better way to use it...

  You could earn large amounts of money if you say you have super high-rez photographs/x-rays of long-extinct animals that you just happened to find in your dead grandpa's safe and you'd be willing to release for some compensation. Especially the human-primate missing link.

  Edit: probably even easier money would be if you can regenerate; I'd bet there'd be a lot of people willing to pay you a lot of money to eat extinct animal bits.

  edit:edit: you can also sell some animal byproducts that have some value, like rattlesnake poisons.

  editx3: humans are animals! You can perfectly impersonate literally anyone. The implications are pretty clear. You'd be of great interest to militaries but as long as you manage to stay off their radar, it should be pretty easy to have a fantastic life. Depending on how the power works, you could also be able to temporarily simulate all kinds of diseases in yourself that others can use for medical research.

  editx4: regarding the above point, the [demon comic](http://www.shigabooks.com/) should apply--depending on how the power works, you'd be pretty much immortal.

    Alas, that's been taken down. Elaborate?

    Whether you can imitate other humans isn't a given. It could be that you only have one template for each species, and you're already that one.

      ? still works for me. It's a comic about the MC whose soul flies into the closest person nearby when the MC dies.

      If it's a template thing then you're literally invincible to anything, depending on how fast the transformation works. You can grab nuclear rods while completely naked, it'd probably be a huge help to science.

        Not having read the books, the summary there seems helpful: 

        > No matter how hard he tries, Jimmy Yee cannot die.

        > A noose around his neck, a razor across his wrist, and even a bullet to his head all yield the same results: he awakes from each suicide attempt, miraculously unharmed, in his shabby room at the Sunbeam Motel.

        > Has he gone mad? Or has he truly died and found himself in hell? Jimmy is willing to tear the world down around him to get at the truth. Highly analytical and utterly unscrupulous, he is uniquely suited to unraveling this bizarre mystery.

        > From the brilliant and profane mind of Jason Shiga, known for his high-concept graphic novels, comes Demon: a four-volume magnum opus about the unspeakable chaos that one indestructible man can unleash on the worldâ€”and the astronomical body count he leaves behind.

  Humans are animals. Humans who have taken the *other* pills are animals.
  ```

  - u/ArgentStonecutter:
    ```
    That depends on whether, when you turn into an animal, you can turn into a specific animal or into a generic member of the species. Being able to turn into a different *specific* human would be super effective in all kinds of ways, but even being able to turn into a generic human-who-is-not-you is useful.

    Or maybe when you turn into a human you always turn into you, and when you turn into a sparrow you always turn into the sparrow that got mauled by the hawk?

    And picking up acquired abilities is a bit iffy.

    Of course you could turn into a member of a species where every individual is a powerful wizard, that would be an inherent ability.

        The question now is whether these descriptions are actually the definition of the power the pills grant you or if they were written by whoever created them.

        In the second case I'd rather not rely on technically being correct, when there's a good chance the creator just didn't think about the semantics when they described their pill.
        ```

        Any malicious narrator could paper over that difference. \^^

        I'd still try something like the Mobiles from High Wizardry first.

    This is head canon for me now. Black pill guy just ended up selecting for a future where green pill guy dies before he figures this out, so that he doesn't have to deal with the suboptimal outcome of competing with someone who has his power.

    edit: To add, since black pill clearly uses the most OP interpretation of "can see one month into the future" it seems to be in line with the flavor of the story to give green pill a similarly OP treatment. Turns out early game advantage is the most OP of all though.

      Black Pill guy seems to be more about synergy between powers, more than competing with them.

  Obviously you are the world's best spy.  Also, Assassin.  The number of ways in which these jobs could be accomplished is basically endless.

  You can make yourself near invincible by turning into a [Tardigrade](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2280286/Meet-toughest-animal-planet-The-water-bear-survive-frozen-boiled-float-space-live-200-years.html).

  You could perform entropy shenanigans much like red does (for example creating a machine that can take advantage of spinning you up to several G's as a tick then turn into a blue whale - suddenly a lot more energy in the system. 

  Obviously lots of exploration could be done, the bottom of the ocean and places humans can't easily go.  

  We don't really know the extent of the power of the green pill so below is some speculation.

  Dinosaur and other extinct species.  Obviously interesting from a research perspective... Already mentioned but He also clearly violates physical laws so could provide energy in a variety of ways.  Turning into a very large dinosaur for a sort of 'super strength' to increase the energy but only needing to eat what a human eats (as far as we know).   Could also explore lots of other extinct species, depending on exactly how familiar with the species you need to be there could be all kinds of exotic creatures that are possible.

  Not entirely certain if wounds taken in animal form carry over to human form and to what degree, knowing that would be useful (the only mention of wounds came from when the eagle had him by the leg in human form, it sounded a bit like he had taken more damage as a sparrow).  If they do carry over, you can heal a lot faster in sloth form or even regenerate limbs in salamander form.  If they don't, you can harvest materials more aggressively than mentioned earlier and perform all kinds of shenanigans.

  If he is not limited to animals but any living creature:
  Having human intelligence as a bacteria would certainly be interesting from a scientific perspective and might yield useful information.  Could you reproduce in bacterial form and split into several yous?  

  Could he turn into an aspen forest, which is technically a single organism?  I just don't know the extent of his shapeshifting powers...



  I'll try to think of some more but thats what I got for now.

    A perpetual motion machine with a cycle time limited by how fast you could transform would be pretty easy to design.

    > Obviously lots of exploration could be done, the bottom of the ocean and places humans can't easily go.

    Blue pill guy is already doing that, but yeh.

    > Having human intelligence as a bacteria would certainly be interesting from a scientific perspective and might yield useful information.

    Or insanity. Bacterial senses would be super different.

    > Could you reproduce in bacterial form and split into several yous?

    And once you do, when you change back, does Rule 34 apply?
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      Is "sense" even the right word for what bacteria do, qualitatively? What if you found that a bacteria is totally mechanical, with no brain or brain-equivalent for the mind to jack into? You'd just go totally dark, deprived of all senses, and then you'd probably die eventually.
      ```

      - u/Ozimandius:
        ```
        Well, if he is able to think normally as a sparrow, obviously there are some supernatural shenanigans going on, which is why I mentioned it.  You would obviously want to try it first on a sliding scale of creature sizes and brain capacities until you were sure.

    He'd get a lot less dizzy by simply standing on a spring-loaded platform and rapidly switching between blue whale and flea.

    Though he'd still only generate a tiny fraction of the energy that Red does, of course.
    ```

    - u/Ozimandius:
      ```
      We don't have exact numbers on red's super strength, but exerting 300,000 lbs of force would be hard to call a tiny fraction of it in my opinion.

        We do have that people thought he had 'no upper limit'. I get the impression he could have easily picked up beached whales and tossed them into the sea in order to try to impress girls at some point. He might even have juggled them if he had the coordination.

  It says 'any animal', that leaves open at least three possibilities that I haven't seen yet. 

  1. Fictional animals

  2. Alien animals

  3. Future animals

  Future variants of humans could be particularly useful as transformation subjects

  The problem with this pill, as this thread is demonstrating, is that there's such an endless amount of ways to interpret the powers it grants that it's hard to really know if it's overpowered or terrible. 

  Assuming it works even remotely like Animorphs (or, even better, r!Animorphs) would make it incredibly useful for a spy or assassin, but what I'm more interested in is the potential scientific benefits.

  You would be the first conscious being who was capable of inhabiting another mind with (presumably) all its perspective and instincts intact, but your own intellect and values as well. You could learn so much about how different animals learn and experience the world, and help push our understanding of neuroscience immensely.

  Assuming the most permissive version of this power, it is extremely powerful, rendering the red and yellow pills redundant, and even having a fraction of the abilities of the orange pill (or even just letting you copy any other people with powers).    

  As others have stated you can get free energy by turning into a heavier animal and then draining the created kinetic energy. However this is among the worst ways to get energy out of this power. Much more sensible would be to turn into a whale then have your head (well head area) chopped off then turn into something else before you could die. You could then extract all the caloric energy in that flesh (assuming it sticks around separated from your body when you change into something else, but I already said this was the most permissive interpretation).                             
  However since this power would be most useful in preventing the heat death of the universe what you'd probably do is just feed the excess material into a black hole in order to get direct matter to energy conversion via black hole farming see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qam5BkXIEhQ, thus this power is vastly superior to the red pill for energy creation (though the best way to use the red pill would probably not be turning turbines but using the regen to create matter to feed to black holes)

  If you can turn into _any_ animal (though I think it should be assumed you are limited to real animals that you know about), then by turning into specific humans you can read their mind, not only to gain any sensitive information they possess, but also potentially in order to learn skills faster, directly from their mind. [Animorphs the Reckoning spoiler] (/Some of you may remember something like this this from Animorphs: The Reckoning, which is where i'm getting this idea from). You _may_ also be able to copy their powers, or at least copy the powers of orange (though only the knowledge he had already used his power to acquire).                         
  Plus you may be able to turn into highly intelligent people and use your versions of their mind for advice. If you can copy powers then you can also turn into yourself _turning into yourself, turning into yourself, etc_. Which basically means you might be able to leverage this into gaining access to an arbitrarily large number of simulations of yourself (plus a simulation of one other mind) in order to get mental work done faster.
  ```

  - u/DropZeHamma:
    ```
    I think you have to assume that your mind stays your own when you turn into another animal. If that wasn't the case you'd turn into a cat once and no longer have the mental capacity to turn back into a human.

  The guy was obviously an idiot. When he was injured, he could have transformed into either something that doesn't have legs to be injured, or an animal with an amorphous body structure to heal quickly.

  Even before that, turning into something like an alligator when the hawk attacked would work much better. Hard scales protect you from it's claws while you eat the hawk.

  Even before that, why fly around as a sparrow when you can fly around as a hawk, or an eagle? Why would you chose one of the smallest birds, pretty low on the food chain?

  Anybody who is given the option to take any of the pills and chooses green is probably not the smartest person, but I guess it is nice to have that confirmed in story.

    Yeah, he was simply unoptimal to the extreme.

    If I could choose, it's a Peregrine Falcon for sheer speed. Better yet, a brazilian free-tailed bat is the 5th fastest animal on earth, has the fastest ground speed at over 160km/h and echolocation. Nothing will ever catch me, and if I get caught the correct action is to change into something microscopic ASAP to both escape and assure a perfect landing due to Square-cube law.

    And why the hell turn into any sea animal, when a regular ship like a cruiser tops them all? You're a shapeshifter, money shouldn't be a problem with you being the best assassin in the world.
