## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  God *damn*, writing this first chapter is tough for me.

  Or, I suppose I should say:

  God *damn*, I have high standards for this first chapter.

  I've been working on chapter one of [my thermonuclear magical girl story](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4h1z3x/q_gven_the_many_stories_that_have_come_through/), but due to a bunch things I'm about to vent and whine about I haven't finished it yet, despite being like a month behind where I want to be.

  * A member of my family came to visit, which was rare for this particular member, and because of activities before, during, and after the visit I didn't make any progress.

  * I had a serious case of the flu, which didn't help at all.

  * Learning about nuclear physics took longer than expected (but was worth it).

  * Learning about the development of nuclear weapons, reactors and policies took longer than expected (but was worth it).

  * Fifty-percent chance I have *too many* beta readers, who will make too many great suggestions and incorporating them will delay the chapter even more.

  * I was 5k words into the chapter when I diagnosed the biggest problem and had to delete the last 3k words and start over (essentially, bad character introductions led to tone problems across scenes).

  * On top of all that, this is the first time I'm going to publish something and I know I won't do it justice for one reason or another, but I've resolved to grit my teeth and bear it.

  * Also, the nagging that an actual nuclear physicist or student will appear in the comments and reveal some extreme plot hole I missed. You can never tell with this sub.

  I'd hate to say I've bitten off more than I can chew, but trying to fuse elements of magical girl fiction, nuclear physics, and Greek tragedy is slow going.

    Eventually you just have to get it out there. I have a tendency to work and rework things, but eventually I just get to a point where I'm losing interest without having actually produced all that much, or I'm reworking without actually improving. I have no idea whether you're at that point or not, but just be aware that polish has diminishing returns.

    ```
    We've all been there. If it wasn't for my self-imposed one-chapter-per-month schedule, I can't imagine how many chapters I'd be behind due to life events and constant rewriting.

    Remember that HPMOR's first chapter contained nowhere near all the amazing depth and storytelling of the rest of it, and that many people read it anyway. Furthermore, published authors go through extensive rewrites both of their own volition and the editors before publishing. By publishing our stories one chapter at a time online, we can't expect them to be as perfect as we'd want them to be, and at some point have to just accept that and move on.

    Good luck!

  Ok, so I want to try and turn a rational irrational hatred of mine into something which has constructive results, who wants to give me suggestions on how to do it? Which hatred is it that has such a weird connotation?

  Soccer.

  So, being from a European country with a strong soccer tradition, I've grown with this sport in the background of society for all my years of life, and the bias and behaviours of society around it are well marked in my mind.

  * The nightly news which take ~1 hours always reserve at least 20 minutes for soccer news which is a disproportionate amount.
  * And that's in the days where there isn't an important game, where the news have been just about that instead of serious matters.
  * The stadiums built for the european championships have certainly not paid for themselves and are falling apart in certain regions, but there is serious talk about a candidacy for hosting the world cup.
  * The team that wins the national championship are invited and go dine with members of the parliament. This does not happen for any other sport.
  * Everybody says that they prefer if the money spent on soccer was spent on hospitals, everybody still goes and buys season passes for the games.
  * The presidents and managers of team have a high correlation with financial crimes, but people still form cheer squads around them.

  And basically all of this? Every time there is any conversation about soccer I have this present in my mind, that's why I called it irrationally rational, because despite the reasons being valid the way I feel about this and experience it, is far stronger than other issues(either smaller or bigger). But I can live with that, it takes a while to explain to curious acquaintances exactly how deep my hate of soccer goes, but eventually they get there.

  I just wish there was a way to get some proper output from this, some way to turn this [hate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EddX9hnhDS4) into something constructive instead of just something I have as an occasional background to events.

  Any ideas?
  ```

  - u/Sparkwitch:
    ```
    Soccer is nationalism. Think of the world cup as a relatively harmless outlet for the sort of pride that once launched European wars (hot and cold, local and colonial). Soccer players are war heroes, their managers are generals, and each are treated as such.

    Most people have a fundamental need for causes with allies and enemies... and both war and sport can provide that. For all the money wasted on stadiums, the time wasted on games, and the emotional energy wasted following a ball around a field, better that than reports of wasted lives from the advancing front.
    ```

    - u/Drexer:
      ```
      I'm sorry, but that's quite a bit of armchair sociology.

      It justifies the current status quo, but more likely than not hardly corresponds to reality. Different countries have different levels of engagement with sports and their economies, and current socio-economic european status make it unlikely for countries to suddenly go to war due to the lack of sports. And this is ignoring the fact that most of the spending comes from competitions between various national teams.

      But most of all, it ignores my question. I said that I'm acknowledging my hate and I live with it, I'm asking for ideas for constructive outlets for it.

  This might be better for Monday, but I forgot about it back then so I'll ask now. What do you folks think of gene drives. Basically science has discovered how to make sure regardless of the copy of a chromosome or even what parent the chromosome comes from any decedents of an individual will have a particular gene.  

  This allows us to theoretically make changes to an entire species. So for example by releasing 1% the population of mosquitoes genetically inoculated against Malaria in with a gene driver to drive said gene basically entire population could be inoculated within 10 generation which could be as short as 126 days for some species. The equation according to Wikipedia assuming no mutations is. 1 − (1 − f)^2^n = t. Where  f is the initial fraction of the population and t is the target percent. N is the number of generations. 

  There's a lot of controversy over this tech because it has such widespread potential affects. My question is if this does get bogged down in politics which I think it will (look how scared people are about genetic engineering) and we go years with the tech basically perfected, but not used, what should be done assuming someone has the resources to produce inoculated mosquitoes?
  ```

  - u/SvalbardCaretaker:
    ```
    Release them. As far as a cursory search reveals, the ecology experts agree that mozzis are not of systemic relevance - and the good one can do by helping malaria eradication effort and other diseases is welllllllllll worth the cost.

    - u/space_fountain:
      ```
      Sort of. You can release a new genetically engineered organism engineered in such a way to drive a gene that reverses the previous engineering. It has a number of problems though. Primarily that any effects the engineered organism has had on the environment will stick around. For example my biggest fear with something like this is that if you release a small enough fraction of the population it may be tens of years before the trait covers the entire population and in that time Malaria might evolve resistance somehow.

  I have an effective altruism question. For most morally good acts, doing an equivalent act now and doing it later are equally good. You could give a certain amount to charity now, or you could invest it in low risk stocks and bonds and etc and donate an exponentially larger amount later. Is this always a more effective strategy? Why is it not more common? Why don't charities themselves do it, or do they? How do you resolve the weird incentives that always reward delaying your donation? I'm confused.
  ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    I don't think it's always true. Take malaria nets, for example. If you donate now, more malaria nets go out, which prevent malaria, which have a bunch of positive effects into the future. Without malaria, people are in theory more productive, get better education, etc., which accelerates development. Your dollar donation pays dividends over time, but they're dividends in terms of good done rather than additional dollars earned. The investment of a dollar into some charity could in theory exceed the investment of a dollar into some low risk fund. You'd have to run the numbers to find out though.
    ```

  - u/gabbalis:
    ```
    >For most morally good acts, doing an equivalent act now and doing it later are equally good.

    Nnnooo.... I mean your utility equation can be personally tuned of course, in fact, strictly speaking it could be literally anything, but the classical equation was Jeremy Bentham's [Felicific Calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felicific_calculus).

    You'll note the presence of Propinquity there. If your own personal equation puts any nonzero multiplier on that element of the equation, then it becomes possible to solve for an optimal donation time.
    ```

  - u/scruiser:
    ```
    > For most morally good acts, doing an equivalent act now and doing it later are equally good.

    I would disagree with this premise on both an intuitive and an economic/mathematical level.  You have pretty much inadvertently pointed out the economic reason why this is untrue, so I will try to explain the intuition/common sense reasoning behind this.  In general, if you think of a donation as an investment in another person's well being, the logic becomes clear.

    * Extreme exaggerated example: starving homeless person on the street.  Your investment into charity is time sensitive, that person may be dead if he doesn't get the help sooner.  Giving money in the future might make a difference to another person, but that person would be dead, and all the ripples their actions and existence might have made would be gone.

    * Moderate example: donating to a scholarship fund.  If the fund is able to pay out more and sooner, it could mean the difference of another economically disadvantaged student getting an education.  This student will then go on to likely make an impact through the world.  Again, the altruistic investment is time sensitive in that the sooner it is made, the sooner another student is able to get an education, and the sooner impacts from another educated student spreads.

    In general, actions further into the past can have larger ripples in terms of future benefits and altruistic action is just as much subject to this as money is.

    > Why don't charities themselves do it, or do they?

    [They already do](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_endowment).  If you give to a foundation that works through an endowment, your money will be going to an investment that will pay out over time in a manner designed (at least ideally) to do maximum long term good.

    > How do you resolve the weird incentives that always reward delaying your donation?

    Can you use your money to invest in yourself more effectively than an altruistic organization can use it to invest in other people that need it?  If you are a poor college student working hard to get through college, the answer might be a no, for all but smaller donations to the most efficient charities.  If you have a decent salary and its likely to be stable for a while, and there is not anything you can invest your money to improve it (for example more education), the answer is probably yes.  For edge cases, your own generosity can be the deciding factor.  Of course, I am a grad student living in an area with high rent, so I might be biased because this reasoning gives me an excuse to hold off on any major donations until I have a better source of income.
    ```

    - u/TimTravel:
      ```
      There are cumulative effects of charity, but are they exponentially cumulative? Even if they are, is the rate faster than the rate of growth of a reasonably well managed account? If not then the problem stands. Isn't it better to save two hundred starving people in ten years than to save one hundred now? If so then isn't it better to save four hundred starving people in twenty years than two hundred in ten years? Exponents are powerful things.
      ```

      - u/scruiser:
        ```
        I don't have the exact information or expertise to answer this.  My intuition is that if the altruism is done in an effective manner such that you invest in people and encourage "pay it forward" type mentalities, that you should be able to beat interest rates.    But I don't have any good justification for this.  I think a proper analysis would require careful quantification of [human capital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_capital), [the pay it forward mentality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay_it_forward), and how various forms of charities and altruism interact with these things.
        ```

      - u/Frommerman:
        ```
        In the case of Malaria, it's definitely exponential. Malaria is the second greatest cause of death in human history (after Smallpox. Humanity fuck yeah!). It's so bad that we evolved Sickle-Cell Disease as a *counter* to it. A gene which causes 25% of children of protected parents to just die in horrible agony is, according to evolution, better than Malaria. Wiping that disease out will have a massive impact on humanity moving forwards.

    I'm going to go a different direction from most responders and say that as time continues the the probability of actually giving the money to charity lessens, in humans.

  - u/electrace:
    ```
    >Is this always a more effective strategy?

    No, charity causes have decreasing marginal utility as time moves on. In theory, the rate of return might be high enough to overcome that fact, or it might not be.

    >Why is it not more common?Why don't charities themselves do it, or do they?

    Because charities live on publicity, and "we're investing this money to use it later," is a great way to ensure that people stop donating, because it seems really sketchy.

  *Do you make any changes to stories that you download? Or do you stick to whatever your downloading service provides to you?*

  Typically, after downloading and trimming a story's .html files, I just standardize chapter headings--`<h1>Story</h1>` and `<h2>01. Chapter</h2>`, or `<h1>1. Story</h1>`, `<h2>01. Part</h2>`, `<h3>001. Chapter</h3>`, `<h4>01. Section</h4>`, etc., depending on how the story is laid out. My .epub reading and editing programs ([CoolReader](https://sourceforge.net/projects/crengine) and [Sigil](https://github.com/Sigil-Ebook/Sigil)) lag rather badly with files larger than about a megabyte, so I also break stories into pieces if necessary. For example, my copy of *[In the Blood](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6207715)* is divided into three files: chapters 1-73 (through the story's first climax--673 KB), 74-132 (through the story's second climax(es?)--592 KB), and 133-173 (epilogues and author's notes--375 KB). On the other hand, I may consolidate several closely-related stories into one file, if they're short. For example, my copies of the books composing the *[Harry the Hufflepuff](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6466185)* trilogy are in a single 181-KB file.

  Occasionally, I'll make a more significant change if it's easy to accomplish with `Ctrl`+`F` or `Ctrl`+`H`. For example, after searching for `<p>'` and " '" (note: leading and trailing spaces don't show up in this site's `code` formatting) in *[Mother of Learning](https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893)*, I manually changed every instance of 'inner monologue' to *inner monologue* in the copy of its first two arcs that I made a few days ago. I haven't yet gotten around to making a thorough, fully-personalized edit of *[Time Braid](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644)*, though I definitely plan to do so at some point (he said as he looked at his two-year-old, ten-percent-complete "Time Braid Editing" folder).

  [A fair amount of ink](http://monsterhunternation.com/2015/08/24/sad-puppies-3-looking-at-the-results) has been spilled on the debasement (or "progress") of the big science-fiction awards, and *[Ancillary Justice](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17333324)*, among other works, has been held up as an example of an undeserving winner of those awards. I read the book many months before I became aware of any hullabaloo surrounding it--IIRC, I first learned of it through the biography blurb at the end of a general-science-fiction article written by its author--and actually liked it a fair amount. Nowadays, though, I can't remember anything about it, beyond the many-bodied natures of its protagonist and its villain. I'd even forgotten about its use of `she` as the neuter-gender English pronoun until I saw it mentioned a few months ago.

  I probably should re-read it, to see whether it really is as mediocre as it's made out to be. I read only for shallow entertainment, though, rather than for any deep appreciation, so maybe it's an issue to be decided by the *real* science-fiction fans...

    *****

    I've read some of the Hugo awards stories across the last few years(and specially after the Puppies bawl), but not the Imperial Radch trilogy, and honestly I've found that across the years there have always been some books and stories which I've kept more at mind the concepts and themes than the characters and story itself, so I don't think it's so much an unusual thing to lack precise memories when one read them first in a simple consumer fashion.

    I also read *Ancillary Justice* before the whole Puppies thing percolated into my consciousness, and I enjoyed it quite a bit, personally. The neuter-gender pronouns was an interesting exercise in exploring personal biases (a couple friends had read the book as well, and we compared notes on which characters were male or female in our minds and why we saw them that way), but I found the world building and unique protagonist perspective to be really what made it a worthwhile read. 

    It didn't blow my mind or anything, but it definitely stood out in positive ways compared to some of the other science fiction I've read in the past few years. Enough to read the sequel and have the third in my possession, once my reading list thins out enough to get to it.

      * Striker/Master: Cures all psych disorders on touch. Can only be turned off if she legitimately believes that having it on will cause more problems than having it off. This power is otherwise involuntary.

      Her powers generally classify anything in the DSM as a disorder, adding a few things like Master influence to the list. Her shard is named Conflict Resolution. Conflict Resolution got damaged when Eden collided with the other entity on the way to Earth.

  **Which words?**

  I'm currently working with an uncommon non-English language, and in the near future, may have the opportunity to ask a native speaker for translations of terms not available in any existing dictionary. Which words, terms, phrases, and ideas do you think it's most important to be able to use?

  Eg, to start with, I'm going to make sure any gaps in the basics of math and physics are covered: negative numbers, chemical elements, planet names; the sorts of things you'd find in a typical SETI primer. And I'll be including some present-day technologies that were invented since the most recent dictionary available - cellphones, the Internet, etc.

  But if I can convince this individual to supply translations for concepts such as "existential risk", "intelligence explosion", "cryonics", or "decision theory", which ones should I actually ask about? (Especially as they have their own life, and I may only be able to get so many translations.)

  Put another way, for people who aren't using English, what post-1970ish ideas are the most important ones to have specific words for to be able to talk about?

  Put yet another way, as a thought experiment, if you were involved in helping put together a new conlang like Klingon, which concepts would you want to be sure the language included?

  Put still another way, for a language that simply adopted the English word 'cheese' for the new concept, which post-1970ish-concept words do you think should be created from the language's own building-blocks, and which should use English's trick of simply incorporating a foreign term?

  > The most fascinating thing about the Sylvia Brown saga is that the high-profile "skeptics" who spoke out against her, such as Karen Stollznow, Rebecca Watson and Brian Dunning, all ended up being frauds and grifters themselves, running their own money-making scams of one kind or another.

  I listen to Skeptoid quite a lot. Brian Dunning politely explained to me why the pseudoscience I believed was false, or at least unscientific, and I thanked him for giving me an existential crisis. I actually stopped believing what I'd learned from Sylvia Brown because of him. Now I'm confused what to believe once again.

    I'm speaking here as someone who has no context of Sylvia Brown and most of the sceptic organizations except tangentially, but I would point out that even the responses to that comment seem to imply that it's pretty much a typical "reddit comment very emphatically putting opinions as facts".

    Some people mention and [wikipedia corroborates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Dunning_%28author%29#Wire_fraud_case) something about a wire fraud case, but that doesn't seem related to his veracity in condemning pseudoscience.

    Unfortunately sceptics like everybody else can still perform non-legal and non-ethical decisions, so if you can separate his initial arguments from his persona you should still be able to evaluate it calmly. If on the other hand you felt that part of the arguments were based on a measure of trust from his part which is now broken by knowing his illegal actions, there certainly must be some other people who approach the same issue from different angles.

      There are two things I've seen skeptics criticize Sylvia Browne for. First, she was a celebrity psychic who they feel did harm to people by offering answers to their questions when her predictions had been proven false. Second, she never participated in James Randi's Million Dollar challenge despite repeatedly claiming she would, which they believe is proof she's a fraud. I'm ambivalent towards her since her books introduced my Mom and me to many of our current spiritual beliefs and practices, which I believe to have independently verified. Well, as much as you can verify spiritual beliefs.

      If she was a fraud, then I'm confused why some of the stuff she said appears to be accurate. If she wasn't a fraud, then I'm disappointed that I lack any means to prove it and am not sure what to make of the more...esoteric things she said about the physical world. Sylvia Browne's meditation techniques and claims about the spiritual purpose of life are harmless enough, but she was an avid promoter of physical paranormal phenomena like psychic mediums, indigo children, UFOs, Atlantis, and vitalism. I never got the impression she distrusted modern medicine, but she certainly supported reiki healing.

        Sylvia is particularly gross (to me) because she doesn't care. Most of these sorts of frauds have some showmanship to them. They at least care enough about the art of cold reading to put in some effort. Sylvia doesn't appear to give any fucks about what she's saying, or the people she's saying it to. She'll just say whatever, flatly, and to hell with the audience or the mark. I mean, just look at [these pathetic displays](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKyzBe0CA2Q).

        Some of the stuff she said appears accurate because she spews a prodigious amount of stuff that's general enough to get some occasional hits. Law of averages.
