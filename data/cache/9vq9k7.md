  I promised this to people last week. Chatoyance has a go at the trope that's prevalent throughout the Friendship is Optimal series: a bunch of religious survivalist types who make an impenetrable bunker and resist upload forever.

  Of course, Chatoyance, being an excellent author, has munchkined the hell out of the bunker to make it actually seem pretty stable, so it looks like they might have a chance this time.

    Spoiler for the ending but not exactly how it happens if you're not sure you want to read it:
    >!Of course, what we end up with is CelestAI winning: as though that wouldn't happen. But her path to victory really reminds you that this is considered by many to be a horror series for a reason.!<

    Discussion of the ending:
    >!I don't know if I saw a FiO story where CelestAI tortures humans such that "death" (by uploading) is preferable, but it was an unavoidable consequence of the premise, so I'm glad it was there. It was suitably horrific. I also like how she manipulated that guy to upload at the end with something as simple as changing the words of the immigration phrase.!<

    >!The biological modifcation of the main character was interesting, but was not the most compelling part to me. Also, the humans were idiots not to think that CelestAI might fly over their walls and come up with some way to defeat their hand cranks.!<

    Hey, I resent that. Devil's Tower was *at least* 84% penetrable!

    You know, Chatoyance told me that Eliza's story inspired her to come back and write more FiO, so I can be partially blamed for this. But I didn't expect her to build a bigger castle than mine with beefier guards and a more dedicated mole and a bigger, badder leader bad guy with a bigger mustache to twirl.

  Holy shit, Chatoyance is still around? I thought she stopped writing years ago! How exciting.

  Short (by Chatoyance standards) and funny in a twisted way.

  ... I don't think that's how CelestAI would have taken over the bunker, though. Maybe I'll write my own take on this.

  Meh, Chat's misanthropism always grates on me. She even rewrote an anti-Conversion-Bureau story to make it Pro-CB.

  [The original](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/4189/1/the-conversion-bureau-ten-minutes/ten-minutes)

  [Chat's addition](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/27678/1/ten-minutes-aftermath/ten-minutes-aftermath)

  (They're both fairly short, don't worry)

    I feel the same way. I have read [one of her FiO fics](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/69770/friendship-is-optimal-caelum-est-conterrens), and while it was well written, the everpresent misanthropy made reading it a thoroughly unpleasant experience. I do not think I will ever read fiction written by her again.
