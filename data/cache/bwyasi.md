  Oof. Did Neshemah really think that trying to possess one of, if not the strongest sorcerer on Calernia and then killing his love in front of him would end well?


  I guess I've been attributing Black/Cat's ability to see and manipulate stories to every player of a certain level of sophistication, but the Nessie really seems to overestimate the degree of control he can exert by getting directly involved.

    I refuse to believe this is the first time the Dead King has been foiled by the Power of Love™
    ```

    - u/Morghus:
      ```
      Maybe, considering everyone thinks of the Woe as pure villains, that the Power of Love is an unexpected factor? Because Villains can't love others?
      ```

      - u/leakycauldron:
        ```
        Neshamah has full power over Masego but sort of forgot about his love for Archer
        ```

        - u/Morghus:
          ```
          I see what you're saying. My impression was that there was no such thing as full/complete power. There's only the power you manage to accrue, minus the power of stories, minus the power of opposition. 

          The more power you manage to accrue, the more the power of the story is gained against you, and thus as an opposition. That's 99% of the reason why Black managed to do so well, he never accrued power actively, he did it passively. Like a person would do it politically, not through a Name. The universe can handle Name-aquisition, but it does not understand PR and politics. If that makes sense. 

          Neshamah has enough power over Masego to make him do what he wants, up until the point where the story says he's gone far enough. That's when Masego and Indrani's story takes over

          I am thinking that Masego is going to get worked on one of the abused/used/outraged tropes (which this subreddit has had me reading far too much). There will be happenings
          ```

  - u/Nic_Cage_DM:
    ```
    I doubt he knew about the relationship
    ```

    - u/Razorhead:
      ```
      He definitely knew, he went through all of Masego's memories after all.
      ```

      - u/LordSwedish:
        ```
        To be fair, did Masego know that he was in love with Archer? Based on how Masego is a bit odd, it’s entirely possibly that the Dead King didn’t recognize the love story.
        ```

        - u/Razorhead:
          ```
          One would imagine that while Masego himself perhaps didn't pick up on it the Dead King probably would, but this is a fair point.
          ```

      - u/Oaden:
        ```
        He might have misunderstood it due to masego being kinda weird about it.

        Its not exactly the standard love affair between a nerdy mage and hot archer
        ```

- u/Academic_Jellyfish:
  ```
  inb4 the Dead King just shouts "She's trying to ___!"
  ```

- u/OmniscientQ:
  ```
  I'm a bit disappponted in Nessie here. Much praise has been heaped upon him for surviving thousands of years by never giving the Plot an openning. He was raised up as the (un)living epitome of the Sun Tzu passage, paraphrased, "To secure yourself from the possibility of defeat lies within your power. The opportunity to defeat your opponent lies with him."

  I really hope that Nessie has some scheme at work here that we aren't seeing, or this turns the only thing that made him actually scary into an informed ability. I don't expect him to play the entire thing flawlessly. He has to be defeatable in the end. A mistake this big, though, is straining my suspension of disbelief.

  In other words, I notice that I am confused...
  ```

  - u/Razorhead:
    ```
    This is the same mistake that has been shown just a few chapters ago though, when he failed to account for Kairos' personality - that the Dead King assumes everyone of a certain level will act rationally. This is only worsened by his apotheosis, which we know from both Sovereign of Winter Cat being extremely stuck in her violent ways and Sve Noc having Cat as their advisor to avoid this exact situation railroads you into thinking a certain way.

    In case of the Dead King, who sacrificed his entire kingdom for power, this tunnel-vision as it were is that people with certain level of power behave rational and practical at most times, always looking for the most beneficial option.

    Here the mistake was that due to the Pilgrim being close at hand Indrani will most certainly be resurrected by him. Every one of the heroes knows this, the Dead King knows this, and, since Masego can see what's going on now, Masego himself will almost definitely also realise that the Pilgrim is going to resurrect Indrani seeing as they appear to be on the same side.

    So from a rational point of view all the Dead King did was dissuade Indrani from interfering since, well, death has no consequence this one time. It's quite literally a warning shot. And he assumed Masego would see this as well, and not risk himself trying to fight off the Dead King in his soul.

    Unfortunately he underestimated (once again partly caused by his apotheosis) that human relationships can cause people, even highly intelligent and powerful ones, to behave quite irrationally. I assume next chapter Masego is going to attempt something very risky that will put his life and soul at risk to fight the Dead King off, something he would never do in a right frame of mind, which is why the Dead King thought it ludicrous for him to do.
    ```

    - u/Mountebank:
      ```
      Maesgo has been working on a resurrection ritual the entire time, and now Archer now needs to be resurrected. That's the "something risky" he's going to do in the near future. He'll unsubvert his ritual and maybe even consume this shard of the Dead King to power the resurrection.
      ```

      - u/RiOrius:
        ```
        His ritual depends entirely on Papa's demonic nature. It can't resurrect a human like Indrani.
        ```

  - u/Mingablo:
    ```
    When you undergo apotheosis you lose what makes you human in order to gain what makes you divine, this includes the ability to truly learn. I think Nessie is just a bit behind on how tight and loyal to each other the Woe are. He hasn't been around for the Calamity's reforms so he probably expects them to be as loyal to one another as villains normally are. That, and while he is extraordinarily cautious and intelligent, he is only risking part of his soul and one plan. This is a loss, and a permanent one, but he's not beaten by a long shot.
    ```

  - u/CaudexCapite:
    ```
    It is also possible that killing Archer was his best move there even knowing how Masego would react to seeing her dead, and he'd planned to conceal that fact; it seems like Bard did something to clear Masego's sight, there at the end, and that may be something that the Dead King didn't realize she could do.

    A living Indrani would probably have been even more dangerous to the Dead King's control over Masego than a dead one, honestly. Once she made it inside the circle, there was nothing stopping her from snapping him awake in some dramatically appropriate way (confession of love, kiss, whatever), and I suspect the weight behind that would have made it harder for Nessie to conceal from Masego. A quiet, clean kill and an illusion let him put off the moment of realization for a few crucial moments to finish his investigation into the Bard, after all.
    ```

  - u/melmonella:
    ```
    >He has to be defeatable in the end.

    Why?
    ```

    - u/PastafarianGames:
      ```
      In-story, because otherwise he gets taken down by a bunch of children shouting platitudes. That's what happens when you get too invincible.
      ```

- u/Arganthonius:
  ```
  He said "Every last one will turn on you."

  She can't be a hero, villain, devil, angel, god (Above or Below), elf, fae, or regular sapient species, or that wouldn't hold true. What could she possibly be?
  ```

  - u/Ardvarkeating101:
    ```
    She's referring to heroes and villains, Named in general, not literally everyone, just everyone that matters.

    I'd guess something like, "fuck up the continent so bad the gods will just declare do-over and kill everyone, including me hooray!"
    ```

  - u/over_who:
    ```
    I posted this on /r/pgte, but I think that she exists to serve all the gods, to forcibly continue the "contest" that is creation (or just, the circus that is creation). The Hierarch called her the servant of stillness, and what else besides someone trying to ruin any long term plans could unite nearly all heroes and villains?
    ```

  - u/Mingablo:
    ```
    I'm still holding out for the Gnomes to become plot relevant as well as lore-relevant. Maybe the Gods really just want a real life Truman show and the bard is the presenter who smooths things over and the gnomes are just there to stop it getting too out of hand. Hell, maybe its a simulation created by bored sci-fi humans.
    ```

  - u/best_cat:
    ```
    We've only seen one person who's more feared than the dead king. 

    Obviously the intercessor is Dread Empress Triumphant
    ```

    - u/Frommerman:
      ```
      No, Neshamah is way, way older than Triumphant. We know this because she was the last person he made a deal with, before Malicia. The Intercessor is older than Neshamah.

      So, obviously, Triumphant was just a particularly public incarnation of the Intercessor. Way more terrifying than the other way around. If Triumphant is just the mask, what the hell is the Intercessor?

      What if Praes has been praying for the wrong thing the whole time? What if she can't return, because she never left?
      ```

  - u/AStartlingStatement:
    ```
    She can't die even if she wants to, and is being endlessly slingshotted around from suffering to suffering. Her only real way to escape is to manipulate the flow of events towards destroying the universe and all of time/reality.
    ```

    - u/Frommerman:
      ```
      That's an interpretation I hadn't considered. I thought she was just plotting her own suicide somehow, but omnicide is definitely possible too.
      ```

- u/sparkc:
  ```
  > The dead withdrew all the way back to Graueletter and for three months took not a single step forward.

  So from the previous extra chapter we know that The Dead King honoured his part of the deal with Cat. If The Dead King was able to relay the nature of this deal back to his 'true' self it seems likely he will also manage to relay information regarding Bard back too.
  ```

  - u/DihydrogenM:
    ```
    That was the fragment of the Dead King inside the revenant that Cat held hostage. The fragment of himself in zeze still has to escape.
    ```

- u/night1172:
  ```
  Archer dying and being reanimated was so unexpected it actually woke me up a bit from shock

  EDIT: oof big play by Bard, though dying last words are a big deal (even if the person is already dead)
  ```

  - u/Halinn:
    ```
    Not reanimated yet
    ```

  - u/signspace13:
    ```
    I think you mean Resurrected? Reanimated would be a tottally different ballgame, and I think Indrani's resurrection has been pretty heavily Foreshadowed, that was the entire Rationale of sending the GP with her to begin with, because he will almost certainly Resurrect anyone acting heroicly.
    ```

- u/thatsciencegeek:
  ```
  I'm really, really curious what secret of the Wandering Bard did Neshemah uncover. I really hope that if Masego survives and is freed from the possession, he will be able to recover the memory.
  ```

  - u/Morghus:
    ```
    I'm actually, in a lot of ways, more curious about how he came to know about WB and turned into her antagonist. My old professor in history kept telling me to follow the money back to it's source if I wanted to know why something happened. And by that he meant 'whatever had the most value' in total, and to a singular person. 

    So some of the questions I'm asking myself is how he came to know her, how she intervened with his machinations, and what he did to avoid her machinations. Amongst other questions

    Maybe the answers to those questions are obvious to some, but to me they aren't
    ```

    - u/Frommerman:
      ```
      He avoided her machinations the same way he's avoided all machinations for thousands of years: by hiding. They don't call him the Hidden Horror for nothing, he's been hiding in the Serenity for almost all that time. For some reason, it seems the Intercessor can't or doesn't bother with you if you aren't doing anything story-related, so he was safe from her at all times except when he left the safety of his sanctum and acted.
      ```

- u/Mountebank:
  ```
  It seems odd that the fragment of the Dead King in Zeze is relying on Cat keeping the Tyrant contained so that he can make his escape, or at least to open enough space to send a message out. Relying on your enemy, especially one as savvy as Cat, for the literal final step of your master plan, seems extremely risky.
