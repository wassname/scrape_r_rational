  Glanced in on this.  I am...  honestly extremely confused as to why, in his introductory meeting, an ambassador would go straight to the most shameful things he could say about his civilisation.  Covering up completely, delaying, glossing over...  the ambassador seems to fail completely at diplomacy, or even necessary-for-a-job-level bureaucratic savvy.

    I couldn't imagine what would cause someone to act oddly in a universe that contains psychics.
