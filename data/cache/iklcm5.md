  LOL. Fairly sure you meant Moore's Law. 

  To me all the "is reality a simulation?" talk is kinda bunk. Not because I think it's some kind of impossible concept, but because it's one of those utterly unfalsifiable claims that is basically pointless to explore. "Is reality a simulation?" is just a modern hand of digital varnish away from that good old question at the foundation of metaphysics and theology, "did God create the world?". The only possible honest answer to both questions being, "how the fuck am I supposed to know?".

  In both cases, we have to admit the recursion at one point must end - there must be "real universes" just like there must be "someone who was not created but always was" (I guess infinite recursion isn't an impossibility but no one seems really interested in that, and frankly, it doesn't sit right with me either). So there are universes or entities that are original, and universes or entities that are derived, created within the larger framework of the original ones. What's the probability of ours being the latter kind? We don't know because *we have no terms of comparison*. If we saw ten universes, five of which are simulations, we could draw some conclusion about how are simulations any different from regular universes. 

  And no, probabilistic arguments saying "there should be infinite simulations for each normal universe so we're infinitely more likely to be a simulation" are utterly broken. They assume as a *certainty* that it is possible to build infinitely many simulations nested into each other starting from a single simulating machine of finite power. To me, the likelihood of that being true seems much less certain. Scratch that, it seems to me like it might as well be zero. Start plugging finite numbers in that formula and suddenly those certainties vanish.

  Besides, Moore's Law isn't even a "Law" per se. It's more of an empirical observation that happened to be true when it was formulated. It's not a rule of physics. To extrapolate it to infinity is to commit the same sin illustrated in [this xkcd comic](https://xkcd.com/605/).

    Not only are probabilistic arguments assuming some wild shit, there are literally no priors in ontology. Normal bayesian probability has broken down, you are through the looking glass.

    It's like reaching into a bag, pulling out a marble, observing that of all the infinite colours a marble could be, it's probably not blue, then asserting that it musn't be. You don't have priors, the logic is fundamentally flawed.
