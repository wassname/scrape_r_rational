  "Finally," thinks Catherine "a place that isn't under time pressure from an ongoing war or genocide or disaster or magic! I can take my time relative to the surface problems and do this properly! Minimal murder and arson, maximum professionalism."

  Meanwhile the story logic running reality is snickering behind its hand.

  Jesus, she's pissed off literally every nation on the surface by now, time to move onto greater foes now I guess?  Truly, a disciple of Irritant.

    ```
    Eh, the Gigantes dont really give a crap about her right now, outside of her being on the opposite side of a war as Levant
    ```

    - u/Ardvarkeating101:
      ```
      Giants are super into Good, I think.  She's a villain who's succeeding so...
      ```

        ```
        So is Procer, and Procerians get killed on site there.  Their only contribution was training/arming 2 heroes, neither of which faced Cat.  They seem to be as isolationist as 1930s US, at least when it comes to Callow
        ```

          > So is Procer, and Procerians get killed on site there.

          Yeah, but apparently Procer fucked up real bad with something called "The Humbling of Titans"
          ```

          - u/ATRDCI:
            ```
            That's entirely the point. For all that the heros are teaming up, the nations of Good are not "one happy family" dead set against Evil anymore than villains are all in one team.
            ```

            - u/Ardvarkeating101:
              ```
              The point is that good hates evil, and therefore Cat has pissed off everyone aboveground and is moving downwards
              ```

  I'm sure once we get a closer look at them I'll find the dwarves as petty and vexing as surfacefolk, but until then...

  That was awesome. Everything, from the epic description of the dwarven invasion, to the slow back and forth of our protagonists as they realize the scale and scope of their ambitions... I am gleeful.
  ```

  - u/ATRDCI:
    ```
    We already know from intro quotes they've stolen family jewels and forced the family to buy them back, so they can be plenty petty

  Well, on the bright side it will be easier to get a drow alliance if she figures out a way to save their civilisation. Now all she needs to do is turn back a massive invasion, decades in the making, by the most powerful force in the continent and she can't be seen to kill a single one of their soldiers....and it has to be done before one of the other great powers in the world invade Callow since they all have reasons to do it.

  At least it's unlikely that the rats or gnomes will get involved.

    For now.

    Offer to evacuate them maybe. Maybe give them Liese to live in XD

  - u/None:
    ```
    > At least it's unlikely that the rats 

    We had a lot of worldbuilding about the rats in the last arc, and they are one of the bordering nations to the dead king and drow, so I suspect they'll turn up at some point sooner than later. 

    > or gnomes will get involved.

    Agreed on this one. The gnomes are more like an [Out of Context Problem](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutsideContextProblem?from=Main.OutsideContextVillain) or Existential Risk for the nations we've seen so far in calernia. There's nothing they could do to meaningfuly fight them.
    ```

- u/BaggyOz:
  ```
  Well my Dwarf alliance theory took a hit. Guess it'll be Drow refugees instead.
  ```

- u/narfanator:
  ```
  Ten points says the Dwarves are fleeing something.

  I also kind of want to bet Cat comes out of this with an alliance of some sort with the Kingdom Under, but, things never go THAT nice for her.
  ```

- u/AurelianoTampa:

  It would be horrifically hilarious if this entire dwarven invasion is the result of a drow killing a single dwarf some time ago. The previous chapter mentioned that killing one dwarf would cause the entire race to come down upon the killer's location and wipe it out.

  It also means that Cat & Co's hands are tied when it comes to assisting the drow. Either they do so while hidden, or kill all witnesses (much like the dwarves are doing to the drow, actually...). I think the smartest thing to do would be to find some way to destroy the dwarven lanterns that the main army has, which would cause them to get lost in the Gloom and be unable to meet up with the vanguard. Then make sure none of the vanguard escape alive. But that still means having to deal with 15k+ dwarves who have already slaughtered at least three sigils seemingly without issue...
  ```

  - u/Menolith:
    ```
    Seeing how the lamps are fragile sunlight devices, Cat's title as the Duchess of Moonless Nights should be a pretty scary thought for the dwarves.

    Still, I don't think Cat can afford going against them. From what we've heard, they'd burn down Callow and salt the ashes if anyone ever caught a whiff of her actions resulting in the deaths of thousands of dwarves and the failure of their astronomically expensive invasion.
    ```

- u/None:
  ```
  So in a lot of comments on the story, people are expecting her to end the invasion and kill all the Dwarves.  I agree that's likely considering the way the story has gone so far.  However, wouldn't it be much smarter to see if she could side with the Dwarves and get a favor or three?  She didn't really have a dog in this fight and the Drow are fucking terrible.
  ```

  - u/CrimsonOwl1181:
    ```
    I remember it being said that the Dwarves do not consider any non-Dwarves as people. Any kind of deal with them would probably end with them immediately backstabing her and running off with the most valuable resources they could get their hands on.
    ```

    - u/GandaG:
      ```
      Wouldn't the fact that she's fae impact their ability to back out of a deal?
      ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      Not for the purpose of ownership no, but they clearly make mercantile deals.
      ```

- u/xland44:
  ```
  >They’re going through in massive caravans carrying hundreds of them, like a giant snake of light.

  >One of the lamps further in went dark just before I left a place, and what must have been thousands in the distance just… vanished. The dwarves weren’t happy about that

  Not sure how to describe this really, but what if the only way to avoid getting lost in the gloom is to have an unbroken line of light to the exit? Like a tendril reaching into the gloom - and when one of the connecting light sources break, the "tendril" is cut: everyone who was after that point is now lost to the enchantments of the place

  So then, the best way to deal with the dwarves - all of them - would be to destroy the very first lamps, the othes that all the rest are connecting to
  ```

  - u/Nimelennar:
    ```
    I doubt they'd undertake a risk with that kind of single point of failure, especially when the lanterns are deteriorating so quickly without any assistance.

    That said, the lanterns are definitely a legitimate target, if destroying one will take out a thousand dwarves.  However, they're certainly aware of that, and I'm sure the lanterns will be guarded proportionally to their importance.
    ```

  - u/turtleswamp:
    ```
    The main weekness to that which I see would be that the gloom doesn't actually kill, it juts redirects you back out.

    The dwarves could just form up with their remaining lanterns and try again.
    ```
