  Based on the fact that a scan of your recent posts doesn't reveal any recent participation on /r/rational, and the fact that in the past 12 hours all of your activity has been posting links to your book on various subreddits (where the response has been tepid indifference), and the fact that your post contains more starting points for discussion, this post seems more like a cynical marketing ploy to try and put your product in front of more people's eyeballs and less like an attempt to actually start a discussion about whether your work is rational.

  If you *are* actually interested in starting a discussion about whether your work is rational, perhaps you might include in your post a mention of the things that might (or might not) qualify your work as rational, or comparisons to work that you consider to be rational (or not), or an explanation of your understanding of the definition of "rational fiction,"  or perhaps the barest of plot synopses or genre tags, or *anything* above the level dumping an amazon URL in a forum where you have no history as a contributor.
