  Recently got around to finally reading The Thrawn Trilogy for the now defunct Star Wars expanded universe. Very impressed by it, probably the closest thing to a rational take on the universe that's been published. Among the many munchkiny tricks employed, it also works to answer questions like "Why don't starships just run off of AI, instead of being staffed by thousands of crewmen?" and "Why was the Emperor (who as far as we saw just shoots lightning out of his hands) so valuable to the Empire?"  If you're like me and somehow missed them, worth picking up.

  Also, Practical Guide to Evil is fantastic. Working my way through book 3 at the moment, not looking forward to reaching the current frontier.

    I read the first book in the Thrawn Trilogy and enjoyed it, but had trouble finding the second (I've got a pdf of the third). How does the second book compare to the first? I'm not sure if it's worth me trying to hunt it down while I still have other stuff lined up to read, but if it's even better than the first one I'd probably go for it anyway since I really liked book one.

      Do you use IRC? I can confirm that #bookz on undernet is a place that exists. I can't confirm that is has exactly what you want, in mobi, epub, and pdf formats.

      If one were very interested in books, learning how to use IRC is probably very worthwhile, and a lot easier than the alternatives.

  Some works that piled up in my backlog.

  **Fanfiction**

  * [*Man in the Middle*](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9303028/1/Man-in-the-Middle), a *Sword Art Online* fanfiction. Instead of focusing on the people trapped in the death game, it shows a government-sponsored rescue operation conducted by programmers and engineers. A fascinating deconstruction of SAO's premise, done in a way that would appeal to this subreddit. **Complete.**

  * [*Transcedent Humanity*](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9271192/1/Transcendent-Humanity), a *Mass Effect* fanfiction. Premise: humanity never developed FTL, and was forced to grow within the Solar System's bounds, achieving a "soft" singularity â€” building a Matrioshka Brain filled with uploads around the Sun. Canon gets horribly derailed the moment transhumanity meets Turians. **Appears to be dead.**

  * [*Modern Cannibals*](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12446468/1/Modern-Cannibals). Nominally a *Homestuck* fanfiction, it's set in a world mostly indistinguishable from ours, and follows a group of ~~friends~~ acquaintances on a trip to a Las Vegas FanCon. Among its positives is very good and unique characterization, entertaining plot, discussion of author/consumer relationship, an absolutely fascinating last chapter, and some metafictional shenanigans. Negatives: the majoiry of the characters are irrational, or have crippling psychological issues. **Complete.**    
   Additionally, it's a work of Bavitz, the author of a rational *Puella Magi Madoka Magica* fanfic [*Fargo*](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11228999/1/Fargo).

  **Movies**

  * [*Coherence*](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Coherence), a movie. A group of friends find themselves isolated in their house and its immediate surroundings; shortly thereafter, strange happenings begin. It's a curious case where the majority of characters are pretty *irrational*, as real people are, but despite that, they're clearly Level One Intelligent: they think about their situation, compare it to their experience with movies, and so on. [A moderately spoiling hook:](#s " the main characters could travel to alternate versions of their house by walking into the dark place on the street. Warfare against themselves ensues.")

  * [*The Last Horror Movie*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Horror_Movie), a movie. Follows a competent serial killer's activity, as he films his kills and talks to the hypothetical viewer. Filled with attacks on the viewer's morality, some meta-commentary, disturbing contrasts between the murderer's murdering and his "daily" self, and [ending spoiler](#s " a pretty damn good The Fourth Wall Will Not Protect You twist").

    I just read _Man in the Middle_! I was really obsessed with SAO when the first anime came out, and even read the 6 first light novels (which were horrible by the way, or at least the translation was). However this fic is great.

  If I'm ever going to be thrown back in time or into another world and I have no idea of what I'll be facing, then [Timelines of Science](https://www.amazon.com/Timelines-Science-Dk-Smithsonian-DK/dp/1465442472) is the book I want to take with me. It's a very well-illustrated book about the scientific inventions and history of scientific figures throughout time from the prehistoric era to the modern day. It doesn't go very in depth into the separate scientific principles mentioned, but it's a great way to review the various technology developed over time and the order of such technology. Kinda expensive, I got mine slightly used but like new for $13.

  [Math Girls](http://bentobooks.com/mathgirls/) is an incredible series of books about three teens in high school discussing math from an elementary to college/graduate level. There's a sample from each of the three books in the series provided in the linked website. The samples are a very good indication of the quality of the rest of the book and should be helpful in deciding if you want the books.

  **My Hero Academia**

  * [Yesterday Upon The Stair](http://archiveofourown.org/works/8337607/chapters/19098982)

  * [know what i've made by the marks on my hands](http://archiveofourown.org/works/11356197/chapters/25417506)

  * [but you gotta get up at least once more](http://archiveofourown.org/works/7392847/chapters/16792135)

  Not necessarily rational, but rather recommendations for anyone who really wants to read more stuff about the anime, but the series is updating too slowly for your tastes. Mostly about Midoriya with a quirk or something unusual about him.

  [The Steerswoman](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/793297.The_Steerswoman) - It's a series that has been recommended here a few times, but it's been a while since the last one and I've been rereading it. Here's a summary someone wrote and posted to this subreddit previously

  > Steerswomen, and a very few Steersmen, are members of an order dedicated to discovering and disseminating knowledge. Although they are foremost navigators of the high seas, Steerswomen are also explorers and cartographers upon land as well as sea. With one exception, they are pledged to always answer any question put to them with as truthful a response as is possible within their own limitations. However, they also require anyone of whom they ask questions to respond in the same manner, upon penalty of the Steerswomen's ban; those under the ban do not receive answers from the steerswomen.

  I got gifted *The Rise and Fall of D.O.D.O.* from the Reddit sci-fi exchange! I love Neal Stephenson, so I dove right in. A government agency discovers that magic was real until 1851 and hires an adjunct professor of ancient languages to translate relevant documentation. Pretty solid explanation for why magic worked and why it stopped working, and at least the main characters are rational (but definitely not rationalist). 

  EDIT: 300 pages in. This book has made me laugh out loud more than anything since the Hitchhiker's Guide.

  I'm sure a lot of people on here have already read some of Sir Terry Pratchett's Discworld series (if you haven't, go do it now - *Mort* or *Guards, Guards* are good starting points), but I'd like to recommend the Bromeliad trilogy.

  It's a young adult series but I recently reread it and really enjoyed it anyway. While not fully rational, it has some rationalist traits (it explicitly rejects storybook thinking a few times, but it also has Pratchett's classic style of worldbuilding, albeit without magic). The core theme of the series is also something I think a lot of people on here would enjoy.

  Most importantly, it's fun and creative.

  ---

  I also read the first book in the Banners of Blood series, called 'Son of the Morning'. It's... kind of hard to describe, except that it has some similarities with Unsong despite not having much humour. Set during the start of the Hundred Years' War, it's excellent at capturing a foreign culture and mindset and its approach to reinterpreting a more active religion is excellent. I recommend it to anyone who liked Unsong for reasons other than creative puns, kaballah and the humour. You don't need to know anything about the relevant time period going into it - I didn't, at least - but it might add some extra pleasure if you recognise some of the characters.

  Can anyone recommend to me racing stories? Specifically stories that involve a race of any type where various contestants have to cover a long distance to obtain a prize. I find such stories to be really interesting, but I only know two of them.

  * [Wolf by Wolf](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24807186-wolf-by-wolf) - It's 1956, and can Yael use her supernatural powers of shape-shifting to win a motorcycle race and earn the prize of an audience with the reclusive Hitler to kill him?

  * [JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Steel Ball Run](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventureSteelBallRun) - Part 7 of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure which is centered around a cross-country horse race.
  ```

  - u/LazarusRises:
    ```
    [The Adventure Zone](http://www.maximumfun.org/adventure-zone/ep-1-here-there-be-gerblins-chapter-one) has an amazing, cinematic, Mad Max-style car chase arc! It's called Petals to the Metal. I recommend starting from the beginning as it's a fantastic story, but you could probably just listen to the one arc and be fine.

    Caveat: does not even try to be rational. Still hilarious and great storytelling.
    ```

  - u/duffmancd:
    ```
    [Hovercar racer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hover_Car_Racer) by Matthew Reilly might fit your bill. It's about a season of the fictional "hovercar" races, the courses vary from F1-style street loops to rally-style scenic circuits (and one points based orienteering race). It's a lot of fun, and Matthew Reilly is a master of characters thinking their way out of a situation whilst in the middle of an action scene. The book was originally released free on-line so you may be able to find a pdf copy if you look hard enough.

    The smart characters are at Level 1 intelligent characters with moments of murder-mystery brilliance (putting together Chekhovs from earlier in the plot). It's tonnes of fun but it isn't rationalist in the slightest.

    [Edit] It's also very much in the YA genre, so keep that in mind.

    I assume you like anime if you like JoJo, so I recommend [Redline](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeaYaI-VAI) purely on the merits of its visuals. The video I linked talks up the characters, but I personally found every scene that wasn't during a race rather boring. However, when the race is on, it's some of the most spectacular high-energy animation I've ever seen in my life. It's totally irrational, of course, but it's such a fun rush.

  [The final book in the The Aspect-Emperor Trilogy by R. Scott Baker is out.](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MQY4CA1/ref=series_dp_rw_ca_4)

    How did you like the Aspect-Emperor Trilogy?

    I finished the Prince of Nothing trilogy, and oscillated between loving and hating the series. The writing would sometimes strike me as impressive, deep, and almost poetic, while at other times just came across as "faux-intellectual" to a masturbatory degree. The characters were unique and compelling, but were also almost entirely unrelatable, and all but a few were extremely two-dimensional. Not to mention that the entire first trilogy is just one three-act (fairly short, timeline-wise) story, so it often felt extremely slow, especially around book 2.

    Given my opinion of Prince of Nothing, how do you think I would find Aspect-Emperor? Are there significant shifts in writing/characterization/pacing, or is it along the same lines as PoN?

    ----------
    Also, note for new readers: this series is definitely NOT rational
    ```

    - u/sparkc:
      ```
      As someone familiar with one of the larger online fan bases for the series the general opinion is that the first trilogy is superior but not massively so. There's still plenty of philosophical wankery on the exact same ideas as the first trilogy, there's still lots of unlikeable characters - though certainly some interesting ones - and there's plenty of epic moments, more than the first trilogy in my opinion. 

      The ending suffers from a distinct lack of payoff in many ways so I can't recommend it without that caveat. Also, if you do decide to read the second trilogy then afterwards do not read the authors reddit AMA unless you want to retroactively taint your entire reading experience.
      ```

      - u/tonytwostep:
        ```
        Oh man...I want to take your advice, yet simultaneously now *really want* to read this AMA...

    - u/xamueljones:
      ```
      Hate to break it to you, but I haven't gotten around to reading beyond the first book in the Prince of Nothing trilogy. I just know that a number of people here follow the series, so I'm just posting the link to let any followers know that it's finished.

      I definitely plan on reading the whole series, but I don't have the time for it yet.

      Sorry. I hope someone else can reply to let you know what the Aspect-Emperor is like.

  I just found out that some old favorites of mine have updated within the last few days without me noticing!

  * [Shinji and Warhammer40K](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3886999/49/Shinji-and-Warhammer40k) - Shinji Ikari finds a boxful of insanity and becomes even more unhinged than before. Somehow, this is A Good Thing. As the grim dark future melts into stark bleak present, upon a throne of tropes humanity might find the savior it so requires.

  * [Sleeping with the Girls](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6052381/31/Sleeping-With-The-Girls-Vol-II-Chaos-Theory) - The experiment continues. What are the side effects of one's pressence if you give it a little time to percolate? Think you can call the shots?

  * [This Bites!](http://archiveofourown.org/works/4833515/chapters/11070479) - Sea Kings, sea-sickness, sunburns, a 95% genocidal Marine Corps and more than a million and one other assorted ways to die. It's official: Being inserted into an anime sucks ass... Buuut I guess it could be worse. I mean, look on the bright side: At least I'm sailing with the future king of the pirates.

  Lol I was just writing one up. Beat me by 5 minutes.

  Edit: Uh I should probably contribute too if I'm here anyways. Talos was pretty easy for most of the game but still interesting. I'd also like to second someone else's recommendation of "[The Fall.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fall_(video_game\))" Both of these games have to do with getting plonked somewhere and trying to sort out what's going on in your environment, which seems to make for a decent plot hook. I don't think either of those are rational though.
