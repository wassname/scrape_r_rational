  Am I the only one who's bothered that whoever wrote the book didn't find a more efficient way to communicate information to the kids than one morse word per book? Come on, if whoever bought the book didn't notice the matching owner tags, there's a lot more information they probably wouldn't have noticed either. Bolded letters, underlined words, etc.

  Although, maybe there are more messages that the kids didn't find.

  As others have mentioned before; the intuitive jumps they make are really starting to push the suspension of disbelief. I know that they're really bright kids, obviously, so they're all genius level. But that doesn't explain how they magically intuit all of these things. Especially considering the short time frame they've given themselves to work in. []( #s "The morse code leap had me rolling my eyes. Noticing the owls, I can buy, but how do you instantly make the jump to the borders being morse coded messages?")

  It feels like this work is becoming less rational and more "intellect porn" than anything else. "Oh hey, we have these really smart kids with all the odds against them. Let's have them Sherlock Holmes their way through this."

    There's no instant jump to morse, you'll notice. Emma had already figured it out off-screen, and so had Ray. The only one to not know beforehand was Norman, and he didn't make the conclusion.

    And, while figuring it out in a second would strain disbelief, doing it five minutes really wouldn't. They're kids. Looking for a code in a line, Morse is going to be the first thing they think of. Perhaps that's being right for the wrong reasons, but it's still perfectly plausible.

      Yeah I think it's a more or less natural conclusion to come to if you're paying close attention to the details.

      You see this owl picture in most of your books, but you notice that it's slightly different in each book you see. So you begin to wonder why it's different and what that might mean. Then you notice that the circles are made up of dots and lines. And if you're familiar with morse code that's probably the first thing that dots and lines would make you think of it.

      It's a pretty natural progression I thought.

      (Note: Not saying that I would be smart enough or observant enough to figure this out. Just saying that it all makes logical sense.)

        Personally I made the jump immediately, so it's at least plausible, but then again, I know they live in a story and they don't.

    Definitely. Intellect porn is what you'll mostly find of the rational genre outside of this sub. Out there it hasn't evolved into what we like here yet.

    Would it be better if they had shown the owls beforehand, with the morse code each chapter/page before the actual characters find out about the nature of their reality?

      > Morse code is one of the first things you would think of when looking for a hidden message

      This whole thing would have made sense if Ray was the one who had pointed them towards the stickers -- since he's the one who actually knew about the thing for years. Or if the story had begun with one of them having playing around having decoded the messages, but not imagining the thing was for real...

      But somehow it was Emma who knew about the stickers, and introduced the other two to them, so she somehow wasn't noticing them for years, and only noticed them in the few weeks since they discovered all the information on their own, independently of the stickers?

      What the fuck, these stickers came out of nowhere, plot-wise.
      ```

        I think Emma started looking at books much more now that Ray pointed out the useful information the books presented about the outside world, which was very recently. And I assume she was only examining the most recently published books for information, which had the owl stickers.

        So she noticed them only recently because of Ray.

    It may turn out that the children are actually "superhuman" in some way, compared to the humans of 2016. What are the chances of three geniuses of this caliber showing up on the same farm in the same generation, unless humans have been altered in some way to make them more "delicious"? We can only attribute so much to Mama being a really good farmer. Not to mention Krone's exceptional memory--are there actually real-world humans capable of flipping through several pages of written information and instantly processing and memorizing all of it?
