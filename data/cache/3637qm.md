## Munchkin the Pathfinder RPG RAW

### Post:

Given the Pathfinder RPG rules as written -- not counting any third-party content -- how far from the classic peasant dirt-farmer feudal system can we get? 

My motivation is this: I am building a campaign in which a benevolent rational lich-king has taken the reigns of society for the public good. Things like Create Food and Water "traps" are the obvious first step; can we go further? What would such a society look like?

  [Here's a link to the Definitive Guide to the Tippyverse](http://www.giantitp.com/forums/showthread.php?222007-The-Definitive-Guide-to-the-Tippyverse-By-Emperor-Tippy), which might share some similarities. Crafting doesn't cost xp in Pathfinder, so you can basically ignore all the stupid xp harvesting schemes. IIRC, an automatically resetting *Wish* trap only takes 100,000gp. Less for an automatically resetting *True Creation* trap.

  Better, you can use [*Blood Money*](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/blood-money) to get around (most) money requirements, and *Restoration* will get all your Strength back. Depending on whether you're allowed to pay more Strength than you have, you can make permanent teleportation circles for the low cost of having a cleric cast fourth level spells on you.

  The end game is a total elimination of scarcity, every important location linked to every other important location so that travel times are negligible, and no real need for a labor class because you can make golems all day, every day. Anyone important is going to have +5 to all stats from the *Wish* traps, magic items are handed out like candy. [*Simulacrum*](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/simulacrum) removes the need for real work, given your nigh-infinite money supply.

    Well, that's horrifying. Thank you for the references!

    Note, however, that Blood Money can't be used by undead for bypassing the cost for expensive material components. So not as directly useful for the example lich-king.

  As it was already said by alexanderwales, Tippyverse is worth chekcing out, as it's one of the rare examples of what would probably happen with world of such magic.

  Another thing that you should check out is this greentext from 4chan: http://i.imgur.com/q6NwLbl.png

    Oh, you.

    >You can read it for free by creating a Kindle Unlimited account (free trial at: bit. do /ku-free-trial) and then going to the book at bit. do /amazon-2YE

    I've paid for your stuff before, but if you're going to do stuff like that I'm not going to do it again. Natural monopolies are a lot worse in the tech world, and it's even more important that one company doesn't use anti-competitive practices to own humanities books, and how humanity is allowed to use those books.

      Seems like kind of a raw deal for readers, even leaving the deal with Amazon aside. There are a bunch of links to that story that now basically say "go jump through these hoops if you want to read it", which doesn't feel great. I get the desire to monetize, but I would way rather have that monetization be upfront instead of after-the-fact.
