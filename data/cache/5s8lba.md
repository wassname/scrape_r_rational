    The plotting in the first couple of books was very well done, and I really liked the setting of the story and the backdrop of a rebellion.

    The thing that's kept me from checking out this series is that I've heard it's Anvilicious in its message about religion. As a spiritualist, I really don't think I'd enjoy listening to an atheist explain to me why I'm wrong, again. Is it actually as bad as I'm presuming it to be based upon *incredibly* limited information and my personal biases, or is this more like Narnia where you can still enjoy the story without agreeing with the author's belief system?

      > or is this more like Narnia where you can still enjoy the story without agreeing with the author's belief system?

      Much more like this. Both series move more toward their respective views as they approach the end. But honestly, I found *The Last Battle* more anvilicious than *The Amber Spyglass.* I didn't get the feeling His Dark Materials was especially atheistic when I read it as a devout Catholic teenager; I just felt it was highly critical of religion as it was portrayed within the series. But considering the main religion of the series was like an extreme alternate universe version of Calvinism, I didn't feel my own faith attacked. 

      On the other hand, I felt annoyed by the end of Narnia because, ugh, he basically just plagiarized Revelation. And threw Susan under the bus. Still angry about it now, haha.

          I think you're right! I haven't read the full series in several years (I lost all but *The Subtle Knife* when I moved a while back), but that jives with my recollection.

  I must strongly recommend Neil Cicierga's Mouth Trilogy (AKA what I've been looping for the past couple of weeks) to anyone who loves music.  The first two albums, [Mouth Silence](http://www.neilcic.com/mouthsilence/) and [Mouth Sounds](http://www.neilcic.com/mouthsounds/), came out in 2014.  (Mouth Sounds came out first, but it's been stated that Mouth Silence is intended as the first in listening order).  The third and thus far final album, [Mouth Moods](http://www.neilcic.com/mouthmoods/), came out just this year.

  They are expertly-crafted mashup albums that create a wonderfully surreal feeling that only barely relies on familiarity with the original song, if at all - indeed, I loathe a good number of the songs used, but am still continually fascinated with what Cicierga manages to make of them.  The use of others' intellectual property means that they cannot be sold, but the work Cicierga put into the albums is very real, and actually greater than what many professional musicians put into their work.  Cicierga's mashups are always a different experience from any of their composite elements, and on occasion what he's created is essentially an original song that merely uses a sample as its instrument.  ("300 MB", a track early in Mouth Moods that plays Moore's Law for cosmic horror, comes to mind.)  I can only hope that Cicierga will continue this in the future; these three albums are enough, but if he continues to put the effort in that he's put in thus far, I don't think the potential is ever going to run out.
  ```

    I totally loved Mouth Sounds and Mouth Silence. I haven't heard Mouth Moods yet, because I wasn't aware it existed. I am downloading it now to rectify this. Thank you, sincerely.

  I've been reading [Perilous Waif](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33962948-perilous-waif), the first book in a new SF space opera series by the same author as the oft-mentioned Time Braid. So far it's much better than all his other stuff, I'm impressed. It's set like 500 years in the future where much of the galaxy has been colonized by humans, and where body augments and 3D printers and human-level AIs are common as dirt. The worldbuilding has been stellar(heh), he's setting up an interesting universe to explore.

    The person in question wrote some interesting worldbuilding stuff for this book - the book itself, I haven't read yet. About [hyperspace](http://wiliamscorner.blogspot.ca/2016/05/sf-setting-hyperspace.html), [momentum exchange devices](http://wiliamscorner.blogspot.ca/2016/07/sf-setting-momentum-exchange-devices.html), [artificial intelligence](http://wiliamscorner.blogspot.ca/2016/07/artificial-intelligence.html), and [nanotech](http://wiliamscorner.blogspot.ca/2016/10/sf-setting-nanotechnology.html). These articles are about trying to set up a physics that naturally creates the sort of stories he wishes to tell while avoiding problems that would destroy the plausibility of his stories, reconciled with our current ideas about these technologies, and overall they left me cautiously optimistic about the book. I'll probably get around to trying it soon, after I finish reading my current novel - his non-Time-Braid stuff hasn't impressed me but the worldbuilding looks interesting and well done.

      See, that doesn't surprise me at all. He doesn't over do it with the exposition, but it's still clear there's a lot of depth behind those concepts. 

      As cool as all that high concept stuff is, my favourite part of worldbuilding so far is pretty simple, his abbreviation for kilometres (kloms) and centimetres (cems). This makes it different and futuristic enough to not offend touchy americans, but familiar enough to be instantly recognizable.  Tbh it's kind of mind boggling that those words aren't abbreviated in common speech already. Perhaps a big factor people resist transitioning is how unwieldy the words are in metric.
      ```

      - u/AugSphere:
        ```
        If you start calling kilometres kloms, then what are the poor electrical engineers going to use for kiloohms? And if you start using cems, you'll just confuse poor typographers with their ems. Seriously though, those prefixes aren't there just to sound fancy, they have a precise technical meaning. Butchering them isn't a good idea. If you seriously need a shorter word for kilometre, just make up some slang like US army did. They use "klick" and it seems to work fine.

      Yeah, that was a point against. Like the fact that [spoiler](#s " the mysterious orphan who was born around the end of the last big war with billions of dollars in body augments and who, for some reason, kept the same last name as her fugitive royal mother who was the target of a galactic genocide.") 

      Also, he could really work on the subtlety of his foreshadowing. That reveal was ridiculously obvious.
      ```

  - u/GlimmervoidG:
    ```
    I enjoyed it. Still a power fantasy but I felt the powers were far better integrated into the plot than some of the author's other work - like his Daniel Black series. Also, the author seems to have captured a real sense of scale in this work. Things feel big, which is often a problem in SciFi. My go to example for this is Elizabeth Moon's Vatta's War series, which ends up feeling tiny despite the author's best efforts. 

    I particularly liked the bot battles and the use of fabbers.

  Steven Universe has gotten so good lately that it actually physically hurts to watch it. "Last One Out of Beach City" might just be my favorite episode of television ever, along with "Same Old World" which is amazing and might be a great introduction to the show even though it's spoilery as hell and in season 3. 

  Plus, a reasonable interpretation of recent episodes is that the inciting event for the whole show is an AI took its given utility function more literally than its creators intended and then started encouraging other AI to self-modify their utility functions in the pursuit of the "rogue" AI's preprogrammed goal, so there's that.

  I just re-read *Friendship is Optimal* and *Caelem Est Conterrens*, My Little Pony fanfic that is really about friendly AI and the nature of consciousness (the latter story boasts the tagline, "As Horrified Eliezer Yudkowsky!"). It's an amazing universe and I got into it far too late (it's, like, 5 years old now which is eternity in Internet years). I'm considering reposting fics from the universe every couple of weeks to invite discussion on the ideas contained within. Is anyone else a fan of the universe and would be interested in it, or would find motivation to look into it if I helped curate material? (Since some stories from the universe are excellent, and some are pretty blah).

      That's the problem, 90% of them are crap but the other 10% are excellent. I went through a phase a year or two ago where I was home sick for a week or so and I just read through a bunch of them, so I could probably curate at least half a dozen stories. 

      Stuff like *Caelem est Conterrens* is quite long so might benefit being reposted in parts, so I could probably even spend the better part of this year posting something every couple of weeks (or more often if people would rather read one chapter at a time. I'm not really sure what the go is for completed stories...).

          I agree it's definitely suitable for the subreddit but my concerns were more along the lines of... would people hate ponies? And how many thousand words would people be willing to read per thread? (e.g. my personal number might be 2-5k words but I'm sure other people have different numbers). 

          I'm not sure what you're referring to about the plot of Caelum est Conterrens and *I read it two weeks ago* so I'm feeling a little stupid.

  I really enjoyed [*Cast Under an Alien Sun*](https://www.amazon.com/Cast-Under-Alien-Destinys-Crucible-ebook/dp/B01I8DTAKQ). It has been since *The Martian* and *HPMOR* that I haven't loved a book this much.

  The story is about a chemistry PhD student who is catapulted into another planet (no real spoilers there since it happens at the very beginning) where humans have been mysteriously "planted" many thousands of years ago and have developed into a culture akin to the Europeans in the 17th century. While it's a bit west-biased, it's really cool to see the main character using science and rational reasoning to get him out of troubles. There's a lot more to it but I can't recommend it enough.

  In an effort to try and find some other good series while [The Gods are Bastards](https://tiraas.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/) and [A Practical Guide to Evil](https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/) update, I started working my way through some of the other [Top Web Fiction](http://topwebfiction.com/) suggestions. Thus, I've recently read Savage Divinity, The Zombie Knight, and am working on Super Powereds. 

  Problem is, I can't tell if they are rational or not. Well, I have other issues with them too, but specifically for this forum I can't tell. I still enjoyed them (some more than others), but I don't know if it's proper to recommend them. Just in case, though, I'll give a brief overview and my thoughts...

  [Savage Divinity](http://www.fictiongrill.com/savage-divinity/sd-chapter-1/) is a reincarnation story of a man who finds himself in the body of a young slave boy in a fantasy world. 

  I wasn't a huge fan of it at first but the story grew on me. Unfortunately the most recent arc felt like a complete side story, which slowed down the main plot's action; and I got to the most recent updates just as the story got back to the main plot. The main non-rational aspect is that many things do seem to happen "for the plot," and a lot of the minor characters just seem unrealistically one-dimensional (assholes just for the sake of being assholes). The world building is fairly interesting, but it feels like a lot of reading is needed to get really invested.

  [The Zombie Knight](http://thezombieknight.blogspot.com/2013/04/page-1.html) is about a teenager who dies and is resurrected by a Reaper in order to save people who are close to death. Now an undead Servant, he works as a sort of superhero to protect people in a world that is similar-to-but-not-quite-Earth.

  Basic description aside, this is a different twist on the trope in that the teenager has a lot of issues not commonly seen in the genre. Hector deals with crippling shyness, depression, racism, and extremely negligent parents. It's unique to have a protagonist going through such "common" problems, which I appreciate. The writing, especially between Hector and his Reaper, is often extremely witty; however the story suffers at the beginning from being dialogue-heavy and description-light. This changes over the years (the series began in 2013 and is still going, though it went on hiatus for a while) and smooths out a bit, but it takes time. There's also trouble where a lot of things do seem to be done "for the plot," and often the rules of the world are pretty bent. "You can only control one element" when it comes to powers... oh, except for those who can control multiples. "You can only use one type of ability"... oh, unless you go into "hyper mode" and get access to others. I think the largest suspension of disbelief is that there are hundreds or thousands of these Servants, but the story begins as if no one knows they exist. It seems fairly obvious the world revolves around their actions.

  I've seen this recommended in other places before, and it's highly rated on the top web fiction site, but honestly I don't think it's that amazing. It is a quick read compared to some other series though, as each update is often only a single page at a time. And the technical manipulation of some abilities (especially ones based on control of elements) is pretty neat. 

  [Super Powereds](http://www.drewhayesnovels.com/superpowereds/) is the one I'm currently working through and have really enjoyed. In this world there are people with superhuman abilities; those who can control them are called Supers and often rise as heroes, while those who cannot are called Powereds and looked down upon as social pariahs at best or walking catastrophes at worst. A group of five Powereds undergo a procedure that allows them to gain control over their abilities, and attempt to integrate in a hero certification college program for Supers.

  I am currently on the second book (the third is current, four are planned) and am really enjoying it. Unlike the previous two series, this one feels the most rational. There is a big focus on solving problems through creative use of powers (or through tactics); the rules generally seem sane and consistent; and many of characters are driven by their own values... though there are a few notable exceptions to this. 

  Overall I think it's worth checking out; I am only about a third through the second book, but so far it's been really enjoyable.

    Been awhile since I read them, (probably just about 10 years aka since I was that age), but I think the The Princess Tales books by Gail Carson Levine are great. They're short mostly humerus takes on classic fairy tales. I'd say they are probably a bit more deconstructionist as well though. Dragon Slippers was also one of my favorites at around that age, but I think it's meant for a slightly older audience.

  If you enjoyed Harry Potter [the Alexandra Quick series](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3964606/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Thorn-Circle) is an excellent fanfiction that is even more coherent and darker, while following an entire cast of original characters in an original US setting.

  Among the strong points are the well written, age appropriate children, credible factions that are morally ambiguous, competent adults, mysteries that need solving like in the original books, some amazing plot twists that actually make sense in the light of the information provided earlier in the story and a flawed heroine that is actually more of an anti-hero.

  Cons: there are 4 books available, but the series is not finished and may be on hiatus. 

  Still worth the read though.

  I'm reading the touchstone series by Andrea Höst at the moment and rather enjoying it.

  It's fairly straightforward young adult portal fantasy, but more Sci Fi than fantasy, with a reasonably interesting exploration of a society with ubiquitous neural interfacing.
