## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  ```
  I want to recommend the game Socrates Jones: Pro Philosopher. It’s this weird indie game about moral philosophy (2-3 hours long) where you play as an accountant who is sent to the underworld where in order to return to life he has to debate a series of (real historical) philosophers about their theories. It’s structured like Phoenix Wright where the gameplay consists primarily of dictating the conversation and questioning the moral philosophers. The cool thing about it is that the game uses applicable (though admittedly relatively low level) conversation strategies for productive debate like asking for backup or questioning the relevance of a point and having a credibility bar which decreases if you challenge the other party meaninglessly without good backup. 

  I’m not sure that it is fully rational but it most likes would qualify as rationalist

  - u/GemOfEvan:
    ```
    Interesting in the beginning, but got very frustrating towards the second half. At several points it felt like I was trying guess what the creator was thinking instead finding a valid counter-argument. 

    I know they can't think up every counter-point people could make, but at least there should have been some relevant text for the more coherent but incorrect argument combinations instead of the generic "your argument made no sense" text.
    ```

    I second this rec. If you liked The Good Place you'll probably like this, based on the people I know that also enjoyed it.

    I found that this pretty quickly devolved into guessing the answer the author intended, but it was still pretty enjoyable even leaning on the help of a walkthrough, enough that I'd still recommend this+walkthrough.
    ```

- u/fassina2:
  ```
  I'd like to recommend 'The book of the Ancestors' trilogy by Mark Lawrence. Not necessarily rational but a really good example of great writing and worldbuilding.

  &#x200B;

  The author is a master at showing not telling, his worldbuilding is incredible and very creative, the combat is fantastic and I'm really picky about this, and the plot is out of this world. A female main character that's very powerful but also very much not a Mary Sue..

  &#x200B;

  There's not much I can say without spoiling things, but it's that kind of book that makes you want to tell your non reader friends about the worldbuilding and think in the shower about how to best explain it so they'll appreciate it as much as you do..
  ```

  - u/GlimmervoidG:
    ```
    Loved the first book - like so, so much. Liked the second book. Felt the third book felt bare and cut to the bone, all the meat gone.
    ```

    - u/fassina2:
      ```
      I felt the first one had a slow start but was very good, the second was really well paced, the third felt a bit rushed but still very well done given the different format he used.

        This sort of critique is great to know. I'll try to stay patient at the beginning :)

  Hi, I am looking for engaging or comedic (both would be great) story or fanfiction with believable character decisions and dialogue. Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated. 

  Looking for something like [Guitar Huntsman (RWBY)](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12642859/1/Guitar-Huntsman), it's funny and the characters decisions, knowledge, and dialogue is believable. I also enjoy his other work,  [The Shield of Vale](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12625131/1/The-Shield-of-Vale), and most of Coeur Al'Aran's fanficitons.  

  I also enjoy novels like: Lord of the Mysteries, Overlord (LN), The Second Coming of Gluttony.

  The Main Character does not need to be male or human.

  Thank you.
  ```

  - u/legendofdrag:
    ```
    I'd recommend the *Gentleman Bastards* series, which is about a gang of thieves in a renaissance Italy styled fantasy world performing various heists. The dialogue is exceptionally funny, although a bit coarse. 


     Some relevant excerpts:


    "I’m sure we can communicate. I speak fluent hatchet."


    "It was strange, how readily authority could be conjured with nothing but a bit of strutting jackassery."


    “I suspect that drink has made you impulsive.“
    “Drink makes me see funny; the gods made me impulsive.“
    ```

    - u/GlimmervoidG:
      ```
      Loved The Lies of Locke Lamora so so much. Follow ups are good too but lack some of the first book's magic. Hard not too. It's just that good.
      ```

    - u/ASchoolOfOrphans:
      ```
      Thank you! especially for the example. I like the humor, and the renaissance fantasy world seems to be a good set up for lots of potential humor.

  Hello! I'm looking for the best litrpg that this sub can recommend! I've read most of the popular ones in both royalroad and the litrpg sub but it still doesn't have the quality that I've  found in most rational books. I'm already reading the litrpg that has been posted in this sub (elemental arena).
  ```

  - u/IICVX:
    ```
    * [New Game Minus](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KMMT9TX) is one of the better LitRPGs IMO - it's particularly good at pointing out the inhumanity of reducing people to numbers. 
    * [Irrelevant Jack](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07KS2HQQV) is another one of those neat LitRPGs that really examines what it would be like to live in a weird game world
    * [The City and the Dungeon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078NXCKZ4) is the same thing, except this time it's a rogue-like mashup (there's references to everything from NetHack to ADOM)
    * [The Dream Trilogy](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ZQMLMS6) is (IMO) particularly good - it's about a bunch of retired Iraq grunts who get Isekai'd into a different world and break things until they get out. 
    * Xianxia is basically LitRPG, and [Cradle](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B076G8DVN6) is one of the better western Xianxia novels
    ```

    - u/TREB0R:
      ```
      I tried out Irrelevant Jack, not a huge fan. The way he got to the game world was not my cup of tea, but that part is easily skimmed over. The side characters don't act in a realistic way (but that could be because >!they are NPCs!<) and the main character just holds the idiot ball throughout the whole book. The "romance" is bad, really bad. But reviews on goodreads seemed to be positive, so maybe it's just me.

      I liked The City and the Dungeon better, but it became repetitive and lacked a plot to get me invested in the book. I stopped reading about 70% of the way through.
      ```

  - u/Amagineer:
    ```
    It's likely you're already following it, but just in case (since you only mentioned Elemental Arena when talking about this sub specifically), [Worth The Candle](https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249) is a litrpg. Its system is more in the style of a TTRPG, and isn't universally applied as is commonly seen elsewhere, but the protagonist still has stats and levels and whatnot.
    ```

    - u/drumes:
      ```
      Already following but thanks!
      ```

  - u/CaramilkThief:
    ```
    I'm gonna be recommending litrpg-adjacent stuff, like progression fantasy, fantasy with stats, etc.

    Reborn: Apocalypse is a litrpg/xianxia hybrid with lots of planning and action, although the planning is more like Death Note than Worth the Candle. Still, it's very addictive if you can get into it.

    The Scourged Earth is like litrpg horror almost. There are stats but they don't mean much, and humanity is beset by space viruses, except these viruses can be hive-mind soldiers, literal fungus, space warping hands, giant redwood trees, etc. Great creature design and variety, and the plotlines are pretty consistent.

    Defiance of the Fall is another litrpg/xianxia hybrid with a barbarian main character. It's pretty standard fare in terms of story but at least no one holds the idiot ball too much.

    The Zombie Knight Saga has the undead fight amongst each other with elemental powers and science! Death is also only a small setback here, so you have battles where the actual people are broken piles of mush or dismembered torsos, just flitting around.

    He Who Fights Against Monsters has pretty good humor, although I find the protagonist to be kinda asshole-ish. Pretty good.

      Thanks! I've been reading the last 3 but haven't started reading the first two yet, guess I'll give it a try soon.

    ```
    Do you mind Book recommendations? As in, not webnovels. Because I got one or two that I liked:

    Euphoria Online (Trilogy) and; Forever Fantasy Online (Another Trilogy)

    They are both pretty decent.

    Euphoria: A Hyper realistic D&D-Style VR Multiplayer RPG created by the world's first True AI. It costs thousands of dollars to log in for a week's session, but each week is 6 months time while in the game due to Time perception/dilation shenanigans. It includes a mode that players can choose called "Death March" which I'm sure you can guess what it entails.

    Forever Fantasy Online: Another VR MMORPG, but this time shit turns *real* real, with NPCs turning sapient, menus/HUD disappearing and death becoming permanent. The change happens while people are playing and things turn for the worse. In my opinion, it depicts MMOs and the people who play them more realistically than many other stories i've watched/read (looking at you SAO). From the way they talk to how shitty some gamers can be.

    If nothing else, read FFO for the dude who played as a big-breasted Catgirl for the lulz and now has to deal with people creeping on him. It's quite fun.
    ```

  - u/Charlie___:
    ```
    I just enjoyed the first few chapters of the webtoon "[Survival Story of a Sword King In A Fantasy World](https://mangakakalot.com/manga/ra921707)". Changes up some boring tropes, has a good sense of humor.

    And since you're already reading the stuff that's on this sub, you've probably read [a daring synthesis](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-daring-synthesis-worm-the-gamer.607375/reader/?page=4), but just in case I should plug it.

          I think [Ar'Kendrithyst](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26727/arkendrithyst) isn't bad. I liked the fact that we have a father who really doesn't want to kill at first and a daughter who doesn't mind at all. It's not the best book I've read but it's still quite interessting.
          ```

  - u/pldl:

      >Erogamer 

      I genuinely don't understand how anyone can read fiction in second person. It is legitimately frustrating to me to make it through an entire paragraph of this story's writing; I couldn't imagine reading through the whole thing.

      - u/Makin-:
        ```
        I disagree with the other user, I don't think it's a pet peeve, you're just not used to it since it's so rare.

         You just need to bear with it until you don't mind it, like motion sickness in VR. Homestuck is 1 million words of second person prose and many people who initially hate it don't even notice by the end.
        ```

        - u/Robert_Barlow:

          To be fair, Homestuck is more like 300,000 words of second person prose and another 700,000 words of chat logs.

    I don't think this is the best or particularly rational, but I've really been enjoying [Wake of the Ravager](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25878/wake-of-the-ravager). It starts pretty generic, and the system has some strange caveats, but I eventually started enjoying the character banter, realized that the 'romance/harem' aspects were comedy, and the world was fairly unique.

    Main character is perhaps too well perched to dominate, but I can't say I'm not enjoying the process. It's an munchkin main character done fairly well.

    It is not strictly speaking what you're looking for but the short story collection *The Fifth Science* by Exurb1a (the YouTuber) scratched many of the same itches as Ted Chiang's stuff. Also *The Study of Anglophysics* by Scott Alexander is a comedic sci fi short story about a world where the lowest level of reality is linguistics instead of maths. Come to think of it, *Unsong* by the same has the premise that the machine that causes the universe to run on math has broken, reverting it to the primordial state of running on kabbalah.

  I'm looking for books that give advice on how to disagree productively with people. For example when critiquing someone's work or when working together on a shared project.
  ```

  - u/onestojan:
    ```
    **Why**: [The Righteous Mind: Why Good People Are Divided by Politics and Religion](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11324722-the-righteous-mind) by Jonathan Haidt - although it's mostly about disagreement in politics/religion it provides useful models. Intuition comes first, reasoning follows. His metaphor: the elephant (Kahneman's System 1) is the intuition that the driver (System 2) tries to control. We can't persuade anyone without understanding how they think first. Reasons are no match for intuition, so trigger the right intuitions (talk to the elephant).

    **How**: I have two books on my shelf that I've read more than 10 years ago. Both on the pop-psychology/self-help side so there are probably better alternatives now.

    - [Difficult Conversations: How to Discuss What Matters Most](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/774088.Difficult_Conversations)

    - [Crucial Conversations: Tools for Talking When Stakes Are High](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15014.Crucial_Conversations)

    Insights I remember (but can't tell the books apart): 

    Show that you understand:

    - Listen and ask relevant questions.

    - Always restate the other person point of view (better than they did if you can - [steelmanning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man#Steelmanning)). 

    Identify their goal (a coworker on the same project may have a different goal then a higher up) and frame you disagreement within it (as a way to achieve it).

    Don't share judgements ("it's naive") but facts ("we tried it, it failed").

    The goal is to have **learning conversations**, not disagreements.

    I don't have a good **what** (reference) book. Buster Benson of the [Cognitive bias cheat sheet](https://medium.com/better-humans/cognitive-bias-cheat-sheet-55a472476b18) (Medium warning, try [his site](https://busterbenson.com/piles/cognitive-biases/)  or [app](https://pocket-biases.glideapp.io)) fame has a book out [Why Are We Yelling?: The Art of Productive Disagreement](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44279111-why-are-we-yelling) but I haven't read it yet.

    Bonus: 

    - Tyler Cowen and Robin Hanson on [Are Disagreements Honest?](https://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/deceive.pdf) (PDF) Spoiler: no ;P

    - John Nerst tries to jump-start [Erisology](https://everythingstudies.com/2016/01/12/erisology/) - the study of disagreement.

    - Paul Graham on moving up the [disagreement hierarchy](http://www.paulgraham.com/disagree.html).
    ```

    - u/hyphenomicon:
      ```
      > Always restate the other person point of view (better than they did if you can - steelmanning).

      My experience is that this can make people angry.
      ```

      - u/onestojan:
        ```
        Interesting, any idea why or what is a better way of showing that one understands?

        Maybe it depends on how one does it (I'm assuming the other person wasn't angry/frustrated before restating). As Ozy observes in [Against Steelmanning](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/06/the-highest-form-of-disagreement/531597/) don't strawman someone's views only to use their actual views as a steelman and don't steelman without understanding their argument at all.

        Steelmanning is hard, but I'm yet to make someone angry by honestly restating their views ("Help me understand, do you think that...").

        Here is Daniel Dennett on [How to Criticize with Kindness](https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/03/28/daniel-dennett-rapoport-rules-criticism/) :

        > 1. You should attempt to re-express your target’s position so clearly, vividly, and fairly that your target says, “Thanks, I wish I’d thought of putting it that way.

        > 2. You should list any points of agreement (especially if they are not matters of general or widespread agreement).

        > 3. You should mention anything you have learned from your target.

        > 4. Only then are you permitted to say so much as a word of rebuttal or criticism.
        ```

        - u/hyphenomicon:
          ```
          What I perceive as a stronger version of the argument isn't always what others will. For example, I might replace emotional fluff with more functional but analogous claims, and be rebuffed for it. The impression of arrogance or putting words in someone else's mouth can also occur - even if no tricks based on wording are planned, trust in that may not exist.

          Phrasing summaries as questions can somewhat mitigate the problem, but it risks the same failures. If they think you're treating their answers as obvious or perfunctory, they may be offended. If you use language that's either vague or overly particular in unanticipated ways, it can arouse suspicion. So genuine questions should be interleaved between confirmatory ones - but it's sometimes difficult to ask genuine questions without veering away from the main point, itself potentially irritating.
          ```

          - u/onestojan:
            ```
            I agree with you!

            I probably made (and will make) all those mistakes. Still, I never experienced people being angry because of it.

            Maybe it works for me because I don't do it only when disagreeing with someone, but also when I want to understand them (make sure I do what they expect me to do, get to know them etc.)

            Or perhaps some of the other techniques I mentioned (like having a learning conversation instead of a disagreement) offset the (potential) negative effect.

    "High output management", maybe. He doesn't explain it explicitly, but more hints at it by explaining how he talks with his managers and acts in meetings. The most he gets into it is explaining that you mostly nudge people's views by explaining your point of view. 

    In this specific example I'd ask a question that implies the work isn't good enough without implying the person is to blame for it.

    ex. A had to write an article, but it's too short, B asks: Was the research material we gathered not enough ? Could you maybe squeeze a couple thousand more words out of it or do we need to get more research material? I don't think X (authority figure, boss, audience etc) would be ok with us publishing it with this many words..

      I've had luck with the "nudging by explaining" thing, but only if it's just me and one or two other people and with much time.

      re: asking a questions the focus on the work rather than the author. That's VERY helpful! I do a lot of beta-reading/critiquing, and I'm always worried I'm pissing off the author when I say I don't like their work.

    Most of the good ideas are in the water supply at this point, but it's still probably useful to be aware of [nonviolent communication](https://www.amazon.com/Nonviolent-Communication-Language-Life-Changing-Relationships/dp/189200528X).

    And here's a theory that I've evolved this past week: what if debate is the wrong way to approach disagreement? What if negotiation is better? Rather than say "here is why I think you should abandon your ideas and switch to mine" you say "here is what we need to do in order to work together."

    Which suggests I should look up some books on negotiation...

      On the topic of working together...

      If you'd be interested in sources other than books, Wikipedia actually has an assortment of helpful meta articles in their conduct guidelines for editors. As you might expect, the largest and longest running online collaborative project has amassed a wealth of experience with interpersonal conflict and disagreeing productively.

      For example, here are few guidelines which have been helpful to me in the past:

      * [Wikipedia:Civility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Civility)

      * [Wikipedia:Assume good faith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Assume_good_faith)
