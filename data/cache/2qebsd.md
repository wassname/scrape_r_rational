  I want to make one strong correction to [the following](http://www.reddit.com/r/whowouldwin/comments/2862yb/how_far_does_my_hero_rational_man_with_shotgun/ci7y8eo):

  >i think rationality PRECLUDES having a screaming drill mech larger than creation itself

  This is completely wrong.  Rationality means *winning*, particularly, *systematized* winning, particularly, *maximizing expected winning*.  Since a screaming drill mecha larger than creation itself is ABOUT AS FUCKING WIN AS I'VE EVER SEEN, having one is the maximally rational thing.

  It takes a very cynical view towards most universes, in that (vaguely) deconstructionist way that I don't really like. I mean, Batman is more mythological than anything, and taking the weakest version of the universe for the rational man to conquer doesn't inspire much amazement (or amusement) for me.

  Like, I'm not even talking about giving Sauron a Death Star (or however it goes), just not assuming that there's a vast and pervasive incompetence in whatever fictional world you're looking at. But this is one of the big things that bothers me in general.

    That's what I respect about your writing. When critiquing a fictional universe, many others would simply take the time to point out a handful of failures of logic then think that there was no point to go any further. As much as people talk of rationality like it's nigh undefeatable and can do anything, but I'm not yet so convinced. Many fictional worlds are poorly designed enough as to be easily abuseable at a glance, but I think the truest test of critical thinking is deciding what to do once those simple exploits are taken away.

    DC/Gotham would not actually be so easy to conquer, as [this poster points out.](http://www.reddit.com/r/whowouldwin/comments/2862yb/how_far_does_my_hero_rational_man_with_shotgun/ci82bj5)

  Yeah, I'd say that between the supernatural detective / dirt-finding skills and the magic ability with shotguns and lockpicks, this is really a pretty OP character.

  Take one of those away? Then we'd be talking business.
