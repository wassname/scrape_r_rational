  Three grammar mistakes in as many sentences. I bailed by the end of the second paragraph.
  ```

    ```
    I did too.
    ```

  ```
  Anybody wants to volunteer as beta? 

  I constantly get complaint from people who bailed out on my stories because of my lack of technical writing chops and poor grammar.

    Currently betaing your first post of the reboot on SB - Going to send it as a PM message when I'm done.

    If you like it, I might be up to beta more. It's not like I have more productive things to do while waiting for calls at work. Reading nonfiction can get draining after a while.

    Edit: Done, with a pass-through that took around half an hour. Check your PMs on spacebattles. The most 'comma-en'(hue) mistakes are misuse of commas(mostly overuse) and incorrect tense/word choice(Had/have/has, etc.). The early parts of the chapter have a higher incidence of mistakes than the later parts.

    Make whatever changes you desire, then strip the color formatting I used.

  Whats the Carter Father-Daughter Blackhole Special?
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Recall the episode in which General Carter and his daughter utilized what they learned in *A Matter of Times* to make the local star implode in a supernova.

    Presumably, this can be done with any two stargate and a black hole....which is super duper scary.
