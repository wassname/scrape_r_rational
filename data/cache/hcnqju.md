## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  >The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.

  Let's say you have absolute control over every living human, but of course it's only related to their will and conscience, you can't make them heal wounds faster or get smarter in the artificial way.

  How would you use it? What kind of goals would you try to achieve? I'm also interested in the morality of your usage of this power, maybe you'd just refrain from using it because it seems immoral?

  Remember that the question is in the real-life based scenario, there is no magic, no aliens, you are still mortal, etc...

  - u/Rhamni:

    Well, let's see. There are some not horrifying things we can do. Let's say we try to end **useless** pain. Still hurts to touch a hot plate, still hurts to get kicked in the balls, but let's cap pain in general somewhere below when it turns into nausea, and let's end pain from arthritis and such all together. Pain is all in the brain. If we can make people dance at will, we can reasonably expect the power to let us selectively weaken pain responses.

    Second, blanket massive boosts in will power and self discipline for limited purposes. These include, but are not limited to: Overcoming addictions, cleaning up after yourself, resisting the impulse to self harm, resisting boredom/keeping focus while operating heavy machinery, watching over small children, handling dangerous equipment in general, etc etc. Just to minimize unnecessary random bad things happening. Let's also make it so people have an easier time falling asleep. We presumably can't magically cure mental disorders that cause sleep issues, but whatever the optimal mental state is for someone to fall asleep, that's the mental state they will gravitate toward when they try to sleep.

    Third, eliminating corruption. People disagree on politics, especially party politics, so let's avoid that, but I do feel the need to include a point on making it so politicians are honest about their intentions and pursue them with integrity after attaining office.

    Fourth, clearly this new power we have has tremendous value, so let's pour a few hundred billion dollars a year into life extension technology and keep the chosen one alive forever.

    Fifth, we obviously need to mind control ourselves into ignoring distractions like reddit, facebook etc and spend a lot more time keeping up with global events, studying human psychology etc.

    Sixth, instill in everyone a complete disinterest in non-consensual sex, fraud, murder etc.

    ...There are a lot more things I would do on day one, but those are the ones I can think of immediately that shouldn't be too controversial. You might think eliminating people's desire to commit serious crimes crosses some important line in terms of overwriting free will, but actually *no*, you think it's a great idea and a more than reasonable compromise.
    ```

  - u/Trew_McGuffin:
    ```
    Unite humanity under one banner and pursue immortality. Cloning, genetic modification, body transfers, etc. Then upload everyone old or not immortal into a digital bank so that their experiences and such are not lost to humanity as a whole. 

    Become a type 2 civilization and take to the stars! The power of the Sun.

    But most importantly. Give focus or whatever needs to the authors of dead fics or fics on hiatus. Authors would be left mostly untouched to preserve their creative juices other than making them believe the entire world isn't under my iron fist of control.

    In the end when you control everyone, there is no morality. There is only one person playing the puppet master. It'd honestly be kind of depressing and as such would best be counteracted through reading, seeing space, and building huge awe inspiring monuments to the collective capability of humanity that just so happen to serve another (vital) function to a one person world spanning empire.

    >I'm also interested in the morality of your usage of this power, maybe you'd just refrain from using it because it seems immoral?

    The simple solution here is to get consent.

    Absolute control naturally means telepathy is a thing. Send everyone a telepathic message about (part of) your powers and what you can offer them. Don't offer them everything of course, because most forms of mind control are terrible ideas that could turn people into apathetic pure happiness zombies or paperclip maximizers.

    To start with, maybe a mental button that can be pressed at most once a day for a few seconds of non-addictive pure happiness, paired with another button that lets them forget the experience if they somehow get addicted anyway.

    Then another mental button for energy, that has the same effect as drinking tons of coffee. But have a major warning on the button stating it is not safe to ignore a body's tiredness, along with a timer for how long it has been since they last slept/rested.

    Then, a mental library that can let each person browse through their own memories, with buttons for deleting (to forget traumas) or saving memories (so they don't forget happy moments).

    Then, perhaps a telepathic form of Skype/Zoom? So that people in areas without internet access can still talk to their friends and family. This might ruin the non-telepathic communications companies though, so we should think this option through carefully.

    There are plenty more options that can be introduced to better humanity as a whole without violating any morals.

    &#x200B;

    Edit: Upon further thought, suddenly sending a global telepathic message that announces various mind control powers might terrify people. So here's a gentler approach that trades your personal well-being to avoid possibly inciting mass fear/panic:

    Establish a company that creates "neurochips". Hire people to make some hardware chips that can be plugged into a person's neck or worn as a hat or whatever. Take those chips to a secret facility for the software to be written... except there is no software. The chips are total duds that don't actually do a single thing. Yet with your absolute mind control abilities, you can set it up such that the mental benefits system you are giving everyone is only active while the chip is plugged in. Sell tons of chips, and use the excess profits to make more chips to donate to the poor/those living in inaccessible locations. 

    Now the public should feel safe in "knowing" that their minds can only be "controlled" if a chip is plugged in, and they can take it off (or have someone else take it off) whenever they want. On the other hand, since you are now personally involved, people may target you for all kinds of reasons, many unsavory. And if you die the system dies with you (or does it?) so its debatable whether this is a better option.

      I can see how this would be immediately abused to become an addiction, sort of like a Wiki-crawl combined with binge watching your favorite memories.

      The outcome would be telepathic Social Media, or possibly even a crude form of an emergent Hive Mind, if you allow group chat in it .

  We're all a bunch of munchkins here. We like to take strict rules and treat them as puzzles to be solved for maximum profit. So what would it take for something like 'dark' magic to *actually* be icky enough that a good hearted munchkin would stay well away from it?

  In Pact it's hard to come out ahead because the forces you call on are mostly sentient and way, way malicious, but it's (just barely) possible to come out ahead without forcing horrible costs onto other people. In the Dresden Files certain kinds of magic can't be easily employed by mortals without it hardwiring evil into your brain, so even using mind control magic to cure someone's drug addiction will cause *you* to slide down the path of becoming a mustache twirling villain.

  How else can we create a branch or system of magic that most well intentioned munchkins would stay away from?

  - u/nevinera:
    ```
    Ignoring the degenerate case (magic that is too weak to bother with), there are a few different ways to make a thing 'bad':

    * negative effects on the user
    * negative effects on the subject
    * negative global effects (I include randomly targeted negative impacts here, like "a random person dies)

    Worth the Candle explores the last one somewhat by way of the Void Weapon Ban - there's a commons tragedy in progress, wherein use of void technology (which is efficient and effective) contributes to attracting a world-ending threat slowly approaching the world (an analogy for pollution in the real world, I assume).
    ```

  - u/ulyssessword:
    ```
    You should *never* use Dark Magic if it has a murder-gandhi effect (i.e. it causes you to use more dark magic, and also has other negative effects on your decision making)

    You should *rarely* use Dark Magic if there are large negative externalities, whether that's killing a random person or attracting the Void Beast.

    You should *sometimes* use Dark Magic if there are large known costs, like a gallon of human blood or a certain quantity of experienced pain.
    ```

    - u/Rhamni:
      ```
      I dunno, *never* is a pretty strong word. What if we paid dying people with hours left to live to use murder-gandhi magic just before dying? The alignment shift itself shouldn't be a big problem then. Unless they get judged for suddenly being evil in the afterlife, I guess.

      But yeah, anything that changes your values is in a league of its own.
      ```

    - u/Silver_Swift:

      > like a gallon of human blood

      That's what blood donation drives are for.

  - u/Frommerman:
    ```
    It is possible to munchkin dark magic in the Dresdenverse though. Killing with magic is fine as long as it's self defense. Necromancy is only corrupting if done on human subjects. Consensual mind control is safe. You're not allowed to bind demons, but summoning them to ask questions in return for parts of your True Name is not banned. Completing a genocidal dark ritual gets you awarded a medal by the White Council.

    The only rule you can't break in any way is *Thou shalt not breach the Outer Gates.* Unless you happen to be Harry Dresden, and therefore resistant to corruption by Outsiders. Harry has made an entire career of munchkining the Laws of Magic.
    ```

    - u/Rhamni:
      ```
      Is it ever said explicitly that consensual mind control is kosher? The character we know who used it didn't get permission, but they definitely underwent a (semi?) permanent change that made them more likely to use dark magic in the future. Similarly, young Harry didn't get executed because he used magic to kill in self defense and someone took responsibility for him, but is it ever made clear that because it was self defense he didn't get tainted by the act? If self defense is all it takes to make it 'safe' to use magic to kill, I think we'd see it more often. Harry has been near death a lot of times, but he never uses magic to kill humans in self defense. There have been quite a lot of opportunities for him to do so.

      I love the series, and am rereading it now in preparation for Peace Talks, but I'm not so much interested in wizard legality here as in the specifics of what corrupts the mind. It's clearly not just that bad people do bad things, it's that unless you have something like the blackstaff breaking the laws causes objective alignment shifts.

      Which isn't *fair*, exactly, but it's interesting. Setting aside legality, it creates a world where if you are motivated enough, breaking the laws *just a little* might possibly be worth it for something important... if you can keep yourself from slipping further. But inevitably a lot of people get less reluctant every time they do it until eventually they no longer need a special reason to break the laws, and boom, you look back and can't quite remember when it was that you became a card carrying villain.

    Idea 1: the magic uses a limited, rare resource that cannot regenerate, and that resource is necessary for sapient life.

    The inhabitants of the world of Unoidea are trapped on the planet due to the physical laws of the universe preventing exit from the atmosphere. However, things other than living creatures are permitted to exit (though not come back in). Energy and matter do not enter the atmosphere at all, in fact. This would normally result in a closed system that would inevitably die out. Luckily, vortexes exist that constantly release a flow of matter and energy into Unoidea, so long as they remain unblocked. Normally, the input outweighs the output, but this can be counteracted by simply chucking out excess matter or energy out of the atmosphere with rocket ships, or letting it dissipate out naturally.

    There is a disruptive force, though. Magic.

    With a simple magical ritual that simply takes a full moon and a willing sacrifice, an input vortex can be permanently sealed. In exchange, the magus gains amazing powers with a thematic link to what the portal was spewing out. A portal outputting radiation will give the magus the ability to spew deadly beams of alpha particles from their hands. A diamond output may lead to geokinesis, and so on. But eventually, these powers will fade - usually, the magus will perish first, but it is observed in young magi or magi granted longevity that the powers will always, inevitably, fade. So while each individual power may be munchkinned to heck and back, the smart move in the long run is to never use magic at all. Of course, with the ritual being so simple, people will use it anyway - leading to ill-intentioned munchikins,

    The next option is living, self-correcting magic.

    The world of Zweidea is pretty similar to our own, with the exception that there is magic *everywhere*. It's astounding, honestly, what sort of things are permitted when the magic seems to *encourage* weird and fantastical things. It even seems to evolve as time goes on, becoming more specialised, more evocative, and so on.

    But... the magic, even as varied as it is, never seems to be fully capitalised on.

    A budding pyromancer, aiming to use his powers to propel rockets into space, and make huge quantities of cash (instead of following the tradition of using it in the military, or for entertainment) never seems to be able to develop his talent beyond party tricks.

    A healer is experimenting with pushing the boundaries of disease magic, and is astonished to find a seemingly arbitrary hard cap of infectivity, even struggling to replicate the common cold.

    A psion attempts to use the ability to make vast illusions real in an attempt to create a supe-intelligent being... But unlike his other attempts, much more poorly designed, at making merely sapient creatures? It refuses to work!

    The deal is that the magic is a tool, used by an unknown entity, to generate entertainment, intrigue, violence, wonder, and any number of other things that are close to, but not really, what a human in the world would want. Almost as if it is constantly mutating to justify rule of cool, while preventing world-ending, world-saving, or world-disrupting events. A mage can violate light-speed using portals relatively easily! They can travel vast distances in the blink of an eye, warp in combat in a way that makes viewers become amazed, and perform atomic-scale tricks to justify the coolest things! A mage that intends to set up a meagre series of portal way-gates to revolutionise trade, on the other hand, will find a lack of talent and a lack of connections with the right people preventing this from ever happening. Perhaps the entity that set up this system feeds on entertainment, or maybe it's all a simulation - but the inhabitants of the world can never quite find a way to make all their problems go away.

    A third and final idea: tricks can only be done once.

    In the world of Tresidea, magic is highly controlled, highly illegal to all but the highest in the hierarchy, and a bad idea to try and do haphazardly.

    In the Olden Days, people are told, magic was used freely for all manner of things, and everything was easy. A mage created a regenerating monster to attack a town, and that same monster was captured, to be harvested for its infinite supplies of meat. No mage past that point tried something like that again. An everlasting storm requiring a massive ritual pours endless fresh water into the basin of Partovdewurld. All magical storms from then on were finite, in order to make sure there wasn't too much water. A cataclysmic meteor strike was averted with one thousand mages, each launching a different magical attack. Such a scheme has luckily not been needed since.

    Of course, as the population of Tresidea grew, some intelligent person on the street wondered why they couldn't have another regenerating meat source. They would be quite useful, the soul argued, and many agreed that this seemed sensible. Magic was versatile, yes, and could do much good, but maybe some goods could be done more than once?

    The population of Tresidea continued to grow, and so came a point where the mages replied that, yes, it would be quite nice, except for the small issue that any time magic is performed, that magic cannot be used again. Luckily, they said, this wasn't an issue, because the human imagination is limitless, and any problem could be solved so long as everyone kept notes and managed not to overlap specialities.

    The population of Tresidea continued to grow, and people began to realise why they were using the meat-monster for food, and not just fertilising fields with the much more conceptually simple idea of fertiliser magic, or growth magic.

    As the mage-light creation artefact broke in a freak accident, people had to switch to oil lanterns.

    As the endless storm was interrupted by a magical accident, new sources of fresh water had to be discovered.

    As an assassin kills the God-King of the Empire, his keys realise, horrified, that they can't think of any more ways they could revive him.

    Magic is clamped down upon. Each an every potential trick, if discovered, must be saved for when it is needed most. Each potion recipe must be locked in a vault until it needs crafted. Any and every trick and trap with physics or conceptual shenanigans has already been discovered, and all that is left is is imagining the most janky, wonky spells that any self-respecting power gamer would decry as literally unusable.

    The world of Tresidea continues to exist, but it always becomes a little lesser as time goes on.

      I love the happiness fueled version. It's not that you lose the happy memories, they just lose their emotional component, which is *worse* to a lot of people. After enough spells you can still remember your childhood pet just fine, it just no longer matters to you, and you wouldn't care much if it was somehow returned to you.

      Also opens the door to all kinds of tear jerkers. Main love interest saves the main character in a dramatic rescue? They may have succeeded, but now that it's over and done with they can't quite remember why they cared so much for you that they went to all that trouble.

    You mention that (at least in one setting) that magic is sapient and malevolent, but it’s possible to win. Therefore, a well-intentioned munchkin may be *cautious* of this magic, but he would not *avoid* it (unless the magic-minds are knowably smarter than he is). Furthermore, I do not think a system of magic with a corrupting effect would necessarily be evil (or at least not *so* evil that munchkins would stay away) because many of the things one would expect magic to do (most notably shape-shifting, especially into animal forms, but also mind control or very long-range telepathy \[acausal telepathy - now *there’s* a thought!\]) would require the magical emulation of a mind that does not exist within a skull (there are circumstance which would make this untrue, but it would depend on the specifics of the setting), and anyone who wished to practice ’evil’ magic without being corrupted could simply run his existing mind on a magical rather than biological substrate and so avoid the corrupting effects. If minds do *not* run on a magical substrate, that means that magic has *extremely* precise control over brain chemistry and neurons, in which case a practitioner of corrupting magic could (at least in principle) avoid the corruption simply by manipulating (or causing to be manipulated) his brain chemistry back to the uncorrupted state - and an altruist practicing powerful but corrupting magic would teach *others* this technique. I would imagine this would be one of the first innovations of a civilization which could use dark magic, though I will grant that it might be as hard as developing A. I. - but given that most magical stories occur in a world where magic has been commonplace for millennia, while in the real world we’ve only have decent computers for less than half a century, I think that the issue would have been solved.

    I think a system of magic in which the net costs are *far* in excess of the net gains would repel munchkins; that is, magic is *always* an obviously negative-sum game. It could be narratively interesting to compel characters into utilizing negative-sum magic for the sake of preventing some larger evil - but that hardly strikes me as munchkinry.

    You could make the magic come from spirits rewarding you for causing suffering and/or rituals that involve breaking certain taboos, like:

    Rape, pedophilia, necrophilia, incest, bestiality, cannibalism, murder, torture.

    If the taboo-breaking necessitates suffering, it would rule out most of the moral workarounds like cannibalizing someone that's already dead, murdering an unconscious non-sentient creature (I guess this could still cause suffering for loved ones), torturing consenting masocists, incest between two consenting siblings of similar age, etc. So to use the magic you'd either have to do some deeply immoral shit or put yourself through extremely traumatizing experiences.

    I've been thinking about 'dark' magic systems recently and I think there might be a fun balance in which they can be used without becoming an unredeemable monster but they're still fairly unpalatable. Technically things like fear, shame, disgust, etc. count as suffering they're just not quite on par with the suffering caused by physical mutilation or intense psychological trauma, so you might be able to get something out of the magic system from those, you just wouldn't be able to compete with someone willing to go all the way. 

    There also might be an interesting dark magic system that could arise from spirits rewarding you for doing things that *should* cause suffering (so most of the taboos above), but they can't or don't check whether or not it actually did which would allow for moral exploits but would still be pretty gross. 

    Another could be receiving temporary chunks of magic for causing suffering but only while the suffering is happening, which would heavily encourage users to do things that cause long-lasting suffering that affects as many people as possible (like killing a member of a large family). For example, let's say you have X mana and you scare the shit out of someone, you now have 2X mana but only so long as they're scared. Conversely, if you smash someone's kneecap, leaving them with a permanent-painful limp, you'll have 2X mana till they kick the bucket.

    - u/ricree:
      ```
      >torturing consenting masocists,


      Though if the setting includes memory alteration, it's worth checking whether someone who doesn't know they consented could still count as a viable sacrifice, or whether it would cause issues to remove memory of the trauma afterwards.

  Assume a magic system based on very simple words, that describes objects and effects to force them into being.  Inaccurate descriptions tend toward “best available option”, and lack of specification on certain categories also has defaults.  Time is always two minutes, colors are always blue, etc.   More words in the spell cause the actual activation to take more time, and more resources, with each Word requiring a specific material component that scales up in amount depending on the number of words in the Sentence with it. 

  Example: ‘Light Here’ would, naturally, make a source of light near where it is spoken, would take about ten seconds, and would cost one splinter of wood for ‘here’ and one shard of beach glass for ‘light’.  Modifying it to ‘Hot Light Here’ would create a similar effect, with the light source also radiating heat, and upping the cost of each component by about 25%.

  Using minimally complex words, what’s the most economical way to describe a city?
  ```

  - u/Eluisys:
    ```
    Would be difficult since there is an extreme amount of variance in which to describe a city. It depends on the intuitiveness of the system, and the limit on complexity of allowed words. "Defined area fit for dense human habitation with defined areas for commerce, leisure, housing, and employment with a system of road networks and utility networks" semi complex words. Does the system know networks? Do I need to specify what habitation means? Do I need to specify what is using the roads? Do I need to specify what a human is, what utilities are.....? What is the arbitrary line in word complexity that such a system draws? If it was the super basics, it would be legitimately pages long.

  - u/zorianteron:
    ```
    The problem here is we don't know where the primitives are.  A city seems complex to a human, but a grain of sand is very complex, too.  As the person said below- why isn't 'city' a primitive of your magic system?  Which words need to be described in terms of others?  Why can you just say 'light', without having to describe whatever magical EM-field manipulation you're making happen at the planck scale?  Where exactly is the arbitrary cut-off for primitive words, and why?

    Maybe the magic gets information from the brain of the caster?  So you have to meditate for a long time on the word 'light' and what sort of effects you associate with it to lock it in, and the same for each other word; but once you've done that, the magic tries to handle combining the words on its own.  Hence why it would be hard to make 'city' a primitive:  you can't pack enough detail for a city in your mind to associate with the word, so even though you can cast the spell 'city' quite straightforwardly, the outcome would be look like a melted wax version of a city, like a blurry mental image vomited onto the world, or maybe it looks alright from afar but up close all the details are missing or randomly made of fractal versions of the larger structure.  A person can't hold the information necessary to describe a city in their head;  the only way to do it, in principle, is have the magic system (which has unspecified computational power) build the idea of the city out of parts you can fit in to your head in enough detail that they don't become nightmarish distortions or weak, broken versions when they're summoned into the world.  Hence why you need to start off  by meditating on a brick, and also adding a sort-of-programming element to the magic system (You're basically trying to get the magic system to procedurally generate a city).

    And maybe you could do something like cast the spell 'paper with the shortest spell I'd have to cast to recreate the city in front of me with definitions of each word in a language I understand', so as to not have to design the spell from scratch.  

    You'd have to make the spell cost proportional to the effect size as well as word count for the world to not be instantly destroyed under the system I described up there- otherwise someone who knew the moon was a giant ball of rock could just say 'moon here' and get a giant blank ball of rock that only resembles the moon if you squint...  but still instantly destroys the world.

    Actually, the same goes for your example.  Otherwise, what's to stop someone from going 'light here power 3.9x10^26 Watts'?   That isn't much more complicated that 'light here'.   I assume you already have some solution to this?

  You are Superman and you have to fight a being as powerful as you, say Zod or Doomsday. You want to fashion a weapon to take them on but nothing in the world is as strong as your own body. It’s why Doomsday is so ferocious, his bones that jut out of his body are the strongest out of his body. What can you do? I thought about Superman using his nails to make something but am not sure what would serve as glue or whatever? Is there anything he could make out of his body? Thanks for reading.

  - u/Trew_McGuffin:

    As far as I'm aware Superman does have a healing factor but not one as incredible as someone like Deadpool who could regrow body parts. I say this because one of the first thoughts in my head was to take out a femur bone and work from there. BUT there is no Deadpool like regeneration so... That's a no go.

    Another thought would be to use hair to fashion out a type of garrote. BUT to Superman his super durable, super strong hair is just normal hair? Like he could pluck it out and pull a strand on both ends so it snaps while a normal person wouldn't be able to do either of those things.

    So to someone like Doomsday or Zod it'd just be normal hair as well? Same with other body parts.

    In the end fashioning a weapon made out of your body without super regeneration or body manipulation is not the best idea. Now another idea would be to involve some magic. Say Captain Marvel (Shazam) blasting the enemy with magic lightning or having Zatara or an Atlantean magic user (such as Queen Mera) doing magic until the opponent is knocked out.

    At the end of the magic battle put Doomday in suspended animation and off planet and Zod the same. Or kill Zod. Though Doomsday stays knocked out and off planet with no killing.

    Start with big lumps of hardened steel. They will probably break the first time they are used, but oh well.
