- u/Roxolan:
  ```
  The narrator is completely omniscient and hardly ever bothers to keep secrets, so the plot just blazes forward at top speed. I can't imagine it working outside of what-if fanfiction, but it's refreshingly straightforward.
  ```

  - u/Roxolan:
    ```
    Having now read a few chapters, I can't recommend this. It's too much of a fix-fic / wish-fulfillment for my tastes. Challenges are sparse, and are usually dispatched in the same paragraph they show up (that writing style again).
    ```

      Step 1. Build a printing press.

      Step 2. Kill everyone who is jealous of your printing press.

      Step 3. Congratulations! You have now saved the world and ushered in utopia!

  Point of divergence: Tyrion's trial; Tyrion goes up against the Mountain himself.


  Continues with Tyrion being particularly clever for the remaining nineteen chapters, plus other characters showing commendable intelligence.

    ```
    How comprehensible is it for someone who is pretty unfamiliar with ASOIAF?
    ```

    - u/RexSueciae:
      ```
      Fairly so. The good bits involve Tyrion doing clever things that don't necessarily depend on inside knowledge of the series.
      ```
