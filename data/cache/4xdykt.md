## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  I wonder if there is any "rational" way to decide what your motivation/goals are or if such things are more or less predetermined by circumstance.

  I've been having a hard time in my life mostly because I have no idea what I really want to do. I've got a few skills that I can more or less rely on, but very little motivation to use them fully. Part of that is probably a fear of failure, but another part of it is also from having experienced small sucesses that ultimately aren't that fulfilling in the end.

  I guess my real question is what I should be doing with my time. And why is it worth it? Or should I just continue floundering about trying to distract myself with entertaining things so I don't think about that?

    I think this is the great crisis of our time. We've been trained as experts, we can do things really fast and accurately... but for what purpose? Making some suit more money while we watch the planet slowly burn?

    Humanity needs a goal right now, it needs a leader that has a vision of a better place we can get to. Our institutions have become more interested in their own proliferation than in the betterment of humanity, and somehow we've got to snap out of the hypnosis.

      In my view there are plenty of areas and goals someone could dedicate their time/life to that are worth pursuing.  Education, environmentalism, effective altruism, and so on. 

      The problem is, work in those fields tend to be difficult or not particularly well-paying.  And I think that's the true source of malaise for a lot of people: a life of continual challenge and sacrifice is hard. Hell, just making money and donating it to those causes is useful, but it doesn't feel satisfying.

      Personally I'm enjoying my work as a therapist quite a bit. I feel like I make a difference, I see the positive changes in people and communities I work with.  But the pay is terrible.  And with an eye toward starting a family in the not-too-distant future, I've felt myself thinking hard about the idea of a better paying, but less "useful" job that, as you say, just pads the pockets of suits in order to catch a few more in my own.

        Money is exactly the problem. Money is votes for what we want our economy to collectively do. And politics is rearranging the money such that votes are more equal (hopefully), so that the economy reflects what more people want.

        Teachers, childcare workers, researchers, charities, etc, are all amazing uses of time. But the economy doesn't value them as highly as bankers, and as such it encourages the most capable people into banking and other rackets. I think the task is to make the economy reflect our societal values again. The problem is that our politics has been coopted by for-profit forces, and because of this the priorities of the economy no longer reflect the priorities of the humans who make up that economy.

        A good leader would need to organize the people to take resources back from multinationals that are enriching themselves at the expense of everyone else. I don't think volunteering at a soup kitchen is going to be able to address our big problems like global warming. (No knock on your profession, it's more honorable than mine, I'm just speaking really abstractly.)

          ...are you being serious?


          [Old things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complaint_tablet_to_Ea-nasir)   If you follow the link it is a recovered tablet written more than 3000 years ago that has a guy complaining about a bad shipment of copper ore. His supply chain was put under stress and he didn't like it. Someone making iron in the 1030 likely had a similar complaint as to the quality of Iron ore. Someone in 2003 had a complaint about the quality of Ytterium for the production of LEDs.

          I agree, if I had to vote between subsidies for therapists  working in underprivileged communities and subsidies for, say, green energy development, I'd choose the latter, because I think sooner advances in that field would have a bigger impact and do more good overall.  I'd say the same for something like Friendly GAI development too, though personally I'm not quite convinced that it's a bigger issue than global warming at this point in time. Point is, there are a lot of areas that need more economic redirection.

          Unfortunately right now there are far too many destructive or valueless areas that our society is subsidizing, and that's the first thing that needs to be corrected before we decide between all the "good" areas to spend money in. Our values as a culture have to change so that what we accomplish does.

  Normally I try not to post to threads long after they've been put up, but the day is still young and I know a few of you read long after the thread's been up for a while.

  I wrote a semi-scientific paper discussing Entity Resolution and overall user negativity on Twitter of League of Legends players, based on number of games played. 

  My partner and I took all the known english speaking followers of the main League of Legends account and analyzed their negativity using nltk in Python. 

  Then, we filtered out all users whom we could NOT easily resolve to a League of legends name. This amounted to a search of their Twitter bios for forms of "find me in lol: %summonername%" This reduced the number of users to about a thousand people mentioning their league names on Twitter.

  After running some gnarly queries on the users, we could not find a statistically significant negativity difference between those who play League fairly often (verified via Riot's api) and those who play less.

  I'm not a math guy, I'm a software guy, but according to the math guy, he organized the data such that the p-value < .05 in order to be considered a significant. P-value was .066 - almost significant, and kept dropping as we increased the size of the data. Thus, I hypothesize that those who play more games on league could end up being statistically significantly more negative than those who play less.

  That said, Vader's definitions may not be adequate for League's lexicons, and it may be worth adding some phrases and terms to Vader's lexicon.

    * Whenever you tell them not to do something, explain why so that they can understand motivation rather than just listening to dogma (avoid "Because I said so")
    * Answer questions as fully and honestly as possible (I greatly prefer asking "long answer or short answer" so that I can gauge actual interest)
    * Provide them with the tools to answer questions themselves; you don't want a child to just come to you for answers every time, because the learning process is more important than what's actually learned
    * Bias them towards media that's as thought heavy as possible
    * Take them places and do things with them as much as possible

      Excellent advice.  To be honest, I'm looking forward to the days where I *can* do things like explain and educate; for now it's definitely just going to be maintenance of a complicated machine that turns mush into worse mush.

        You *can* start that very early; young children usually understand much more of language than they can produce.  (I tried to reflect that in my example conversations, actually.)  Starting only once they start talking might only be more confusing.  And by keeping the language you use towards them a few steps ahead of what they can produce, you also help them learn those steps.  (The sooner they learn words like "angry", "sad", "why" and "not sure", or for that matter "hungry", "cold", "diaper", and "tired", the happier you'll both be!)

    I think the main thing is encouraging questioning. I grew up under Christian parents, but they were always pretty questioning. Examples: Not taking politics, either side, at face value. Researching health advice before jumping on food fads. And most important, changing their minds. I knew of positions in which good arguments changed their minds.

    Oh, and for me personally learning history was big. History begs the question, "If they screwed up so bad, how do I know I won't too".

    /u/Alexanderwales has already hit the most important points.  On the material level:

    * A love of reading from parents reading to me and having age appropriate books available, both encyclopedia and a bookshelf of increasing level readers.

    * Building toys: blocks, constructs, Legos, erector-sets (mine-craft?)

    * I learned to solder before I was 12 and by application Boolean logic, care with dangerous tools (soldering iron burns hurt) and some early introduction to concepts usually taught in 300 level EE courses.

        This depends *hard* on mode of play and relative development of other skills.  Regardless of mode, a player needs to be able to distinguish blocks (visual acuity and object recognition) and move around and interact with blocks (fine motor skills and hand-eye coordination) at least moderately well, or it won't serve as much of a game.  As for particular modes:

        * Creative: can be treated as a near-infinite blocks set without reading, but better with reading (to find the desired materials by name using the search function) because the set of possible materials is so large.  Caveat: monsters can be spawned in Creative, but don't attack; this may be confusing upon transition to Survival.
        * Survival, "peaceful" difficulty: the big thing to be able to read for basic play is *numbers*, because resources are limited but stack.  (Some resources are unavailable because they only drop from monsters.)  Crafting recipes can be learned / intuited visually in most cases, but you may want to be around to help them guess (and understand things like durability and item tiers).  Encourages planning more strongly than Creative because of resource limits.  Character deaths are still possible (from lava / long falls / drowning); this can be mitigated by choices at world generation.
        * Survival, not "peaceful" difficulty: you'd better have a plan or your character will die.  Repeatedly.  Reading strongly recommended even for basic play, but this may be avoidable with a family server (where you do all the complex planning in the early game) if the child can do the trip planning to run day trips (go out in the light, deal with any monsters on the way to desired location, enjoy desired location, be back to house before sun sets) before they can read.  Family servers can transition to having the child as a fully capable participant over time (let them build new houses, etc.), but there are good arguments that this deprives them of the experience of figuring out good strategies given a world and set of rules on their own.
        * Adventure: depends on the map.  Many maps use written signs to deliver vital information.

        All modes are *more* accessible with reading, because that enables access to the wikis with detailed rules and interaction (recipes and otherwise) description.

        Side note: Minecraft version 1.9 made combat substantially more difficult without offering an option to use the earlier (easier) system; if no such option is available in a few years, that may be the limiting factor in combat-required gameplay modes.

    Congratulations on your impending parenthood!

    > What actions would you take to raise a child to be rational? What pitfalls should be avoided, and what positive actions should be taken?

    So much of this will depend on judgement and the particulars of your family and circumstances.  Recall the [Twelfth Virtue of Rationality](http://www.yudkowsky.net/rational/virtues): named virtues and techniques are subordinate to actually achieving the goal!  That said, technique suggestions from someone who grew up with nonrationalist parents:

    * Cultivate the Virtues, along with the self-reflection required for your child to take up their own self-improvement.  Trying to do this for your child will probably result in doing more of it for yourself.  In particular, *reward* and *model* what you want to see.  As corollaries:
        * Whenever you lay down a rule or ask your child to do something, explain why.  (Scholarship and keeping sight of the goal.)  If you can't do so right then, explain later.  This applies even before they start talking!
        * If your child asks why, *answer them*.  (Curiosity, scholarship, and often also keeping sight of the goal.)  "I'll explain later" should be reserved for time-sensitive situations and followed up on.  "I don't know; let's go find out" is generally an excellent answer when true.
        * Ask yourself what the other people and the media that you expose your child to are rewarding and modelling.  (Valuing people as people, or sticking them in boxes and decreeing worth to be based on how well they fit?  Discovering one's own utility function, or following the expectations of others?  Curiosity, or unquestioning obedience?  Lightness, evenness, and empiricism, or sticking to a belief regardless of truth?  Perfectionism, or mediocrity?  Self-reflection, or impulse?  Humility, or daring?  Precision and scholarship, or accepting the first rough answer?)  Not exposing your child to anything against your values is both unfeasible and a bad idea; instead, discuss various viewpoints with them.  (Lightness, evenness, argument, perfectionism.)  Having more rational children's stories would be nice, but maybe you can start showing them some of the lighter rational!fics?  (Read/watch/playing something yourself before showing it to your child will help, and is the general advice I give to parents regardless.)
        * Look for places where you can start introducing techniques as tools.
        * Sometimes it's easier to demonstrate using an example from your life or someone else's rather than your child's.
        * If you do all of these well, your child will probably eventually start pointing out areas where you can improve.  Don't flinch.
    * Always take your child seriously.  In doing so, you teach them that they are important and affect the world around them.  (Remember, physics doesn't care if your child is a child, and society will eventually treat them as an adult!)  It also pays off tremendously because they are way more likely to be open with you and ask you for advice later if you have a history of taking them seriously.
        * Before doing something affecting your child, ask yourself the questions below.  "Yes" answers should be big warning flags.
            * If I were in my child's place, would I be unhappy with this parental decision?
            * If young HJPEV were in my child's place, would he be unhappy with this parental decision?
    * Offer your child 'safe' ways to influence their own life (allowances, clothing choices, free time, input on family matters) as soon as it is appropriate and as much as possible; don't bother with their age in that regard just because of the number.  Be available for advice.  They will be better prepared to make big decisions if they have had lots of practice on smaller ones.
        * Special note for pre-verbal children: if a child repeatedly refuses / cries about / etc. a particular type of food, they may be allergic and unable to tell you.  Giving food choices (texture, temperature, clade of underlying foodstuffs, etc.) within reason can help to narrow this down.

    Examples of good conversations:

    > "I want to wear the green shirt!"

    > "Why?"

    > "Because it's green!"

    > "Well, right now the green shirt is dirty, so you can't wear it.  Do you think you'll want to wear it tomorrow?"

    > "Yeah!"

    > "Okay, I'll do laundry today so that tomorrow the green shirt will be clean and you can wear it.  Please pick another shirt to wear today."

    (If that keeps up over weeks, consider buying them more green shirts.  Observe that this works best when you already know what properties your child cares about.)

    > "Can we play together, please?"

    > "I'm tired and angry from a stressful day at work.  I don't think I'll be very much fun to play with today.  How about you play by yourself or ask [spouse] today, and we'll set a time on the weekend to play together?"

    (A visible schedule may help.)

    > "No.  No more of this vegetable."

    > "What don't you like about it?"

    > "Tastes bad."

    > "Tastes bad how?"

    > "Bitter."  [Note: young children are more taste-sensitive in a variety of ways; between that and genetic differences in taste, what is bitter to them may not be to you.]

    > "Okay.  You should eat some vegetables, because they provide important nutrients for your body, but maybe we can cook them differently or try different vegetables to find some that you like.  What would you like to try?"

    (General rule for food: it's reasonable, barring allergies or similar, to insist that your child try a food *only if they've never tried it before*, and then only in small quantities.  Overruling them if they refuse only annoys them, gives incentives to sneak behind your back, and creates aversions to the food in question.  Even for acquired tastes, let them choose if they want to acquire it.)

      Whoa, quite the novel!  Now I'm definitely going to *have* to bookmark this thread, there's quite a few well-articulated strategies here that will pay to keep in mind.  You sum it up well in one of your points:

      >Always take your child seriously

      And I feel this is the crux of many issues.  They are merely scale-model humans, after all, and ought to be treated as such.  The American whimsical dream of what it means to be a child or have a childhood have twisted our treatment of children to some extent, and for whatever faults I may be found guilty of, my aim is to ensure that lack of proper *attention* is not one of them.

      Thanks again for the response; I didn't imagine I would get quite so much good advice when I posted!
      ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Ok, so I'm not a parent and can't offer real advice from the parent's perspective.  All I can really say is: please try not to fuck up your child as I was fucked-up.

    General good things I guess:

    * Please remember that your child is running self-bootstrapping software on hardware that is still growing and not necessarily perfectly tuned yet.

    * Please don't hit, throw, or beat your child.

    * Introduce your child to reading and maths early.  They don't have to get obsessed, but letting them progress as fast as they want and are capable will instill a good attitude.  Show how to think through things and exemplify the use and value of precision.

    * As others have said, reason with your child.  Do *not* rule your house as a tyrant.  When you know better, explain at least some of how, enough to show you really do, and when you can, let yourself show uncertainty.

    * You are a mortal (in the sense of: limited, not always perfect) human being.  As far as I know, there isn't actually harm in your child knowing this.

    * Compassion and understanding are the hardest and most important lessons to learn in life, so exemplifying them early can't hurt.

    * You can introduce your child to heroes and role-models who use their minds effectively.  Tiffany Aching, Young Wizards, Harry Potter (the originals), etc.

    * You can give your child toys and games that use their minds *and* their bodies: neither should be neglected.

    * You shouldn't bother with lies-to-children.  They just plant the seeds of edgy teenage phases.

    But overall, just try to raise what you would consider a healthy, normal, decent human being.  If you succeed, it'll be a miracle, but the closer you can hit that target, the better.
    ```

      All good points.  In particular:

      >You shouldn't bother with lies-to-children. They just plant the seeds of edgy teenage phases.

      This is one we're already determined to stamp out.  I can't imagine why everyone considers telling your kid that Santa et al are a thing is a good idea.  For anyone, really, but it seems even more ludicrous for those of a religious bent: why lie about one magical being and then expect to be taken seriously for another?  Regardless, it sets you up to be mistrusted in the preteen years, as you point out.
      ```

      - u/None:

        Actually, in retrospect, much of what I wrote was pretending to be wise, but hey, if it's helpful, hurrah.

        >This is one we're already determined to stamp out. I can't imagine why everyone considers telling your kid that Santa et al are a thing is a good idea.

        There's those, yeah.  But I was also thinking of the lies we tell children about the human world we're raising them to enter.  But that's going to get real personal/opinionated real quickly, so we might as well stick to stating the general principle.
        ```

  - u/xamueljones:
    ```
    The only thing I can think of is, teach them how to argue. A lot of the troubles my siblings and I had when growing up could be attributed to the fact that when we had reasonable complaints or issues, we couldn't effectively communicate it without sounding whiny (which encourages the parent to ignore the child's whining).

    Teach your child to calmly explain the problem, explain why they think something is a bad idea instead of saying "I dont wanna!", and always ***listen*** to their arguments.

    In many fights, the goal is to **dominate** your opponents, but when arguing with a child, the goal is totally different. You want the child to *understand* why they should or shouldn't do something rather than just being a perfectly obedient minion. However, be warned! If you teach your child to reason and argue effectively, be prepared to lose some arguments and be happy when it occurs. Many parents believe that as a child, children can never be right, which can result in teenagers rebelling for some independence and the ability to decide matters on their own if the parents are being too controlling.

    Although, if your child is a brat when s/he argues, you are not required to argue with someone who is being mocking or insulting in real life either and is a terrible thing to teach.

    Here's an [article](https://groundedparents.com/2014/04/15/teaching-your-child-to-talk-back-or-raising-the-young-skeptic/) that talks more about this topic.

    On a more practical level for younger kids/babies, I'd recommend learning[ baby sign language](http://www.babysignlanguage.com/chart/) and teaching it to your child. We taught it to our son, and being able to communicate, even just basic ideas, is super helpful. Just eat, drink, sleep, and all done were extremely useful.

  What's everyone's take on /r/KIC8462852?

  For those unaware, we've found a really weird star. There were 2 periods in 4 years where it dipped in brightness ~20% for a few days. Additionally, over the 4 years the Kepler telescope was watching it, it's brightness dimmed by 2-3%. Additionally, over the past 100 years it has dimmed ~20%.

  So there's lots of speculation flying around, and the only theory that seems to be consistent with all of this is an extra terrestrial intelligence building a dyson swarm. On September 14th, we'll get some parallax data that will tell us exactly how far away this star is, which will help winnow theories down.

    I'd be very surprised if it was a dyson swarm, because if it were I'd expect to see a lot of other stars undergoing a similar transformation in the vicinity. This is probably some very rare and interesting natural phenomenon.

    There's a good [Isaac Arthur video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVCpBr3fxdE) on this that raises further objections; e.g. the star has a short evolutionary lifespan so it's not as likely to be the home of a civilization as our sun.
    ```

    - u/ketura:
      ```
      Still, every Dyson swarm has to start with one star, right?  Obviously we don't want to get our hopes up, but we are dealing with *literally* astronomical chances here; how much more does it affect the outcome to assume we're witnessing the first of many rather than just X of Y?

  I'm around 2200 words into my Undertale fic since I started it last week, and nearly done with the first chapter. Feels pretty good! Though I will be waiting until I have a few more chapters done until I post it.

    This is a good decision.

      Yeah, I'll need to do plenty of revision to actually be comfortable posting it anywhere, and I need to make sure the first chapter (primarily background) flows well with the rest of it.

      It's pretty exciting to actually be creating something, for as much as I consume. I don't expect it to be fantastic or anything, but it's nice to have an actively productive hobby, hahah!

  I didn't see The Truman Show until recently, and I didn't like it. My biggest problem wasn't that I didn't find it funny, didn't get invested in the characters, or even the numerous plot holes. No, the single thing that ruined the entire film for me was the fact that the premise is "What if a man's paranoid schizophrenia was true?" Truman discovers that everything he does is monitored and every person he knows is a secret agent.

  From Truman's perspective, the whole world really is a conspiracy against him with the goal of manipulating his life and keeping him ignorant of the truth about reality. What am I supposed to take away from this kind of story? Even the Matrix was just about free thought and rebelling against the establishment, Truman finds out that his wife, family, friends, and the whole town were just actors pretending to love him all his life.

    >What am I supposed to take away from this kind of story? 

    Courage, to seek the truth no matter how frightening.

    He had a few occasions to go back to pretending everything was fine. I think many people in his circumstances would have, but he needed to know for sure, and even risked his life to.

    I agree the movie can have unfortunate implications to anyone suffering from delusions or paranoia who watches it, but the same can be said for a lot of films.
    ```

    - u/trekie140:
      ```
      I recall the first moment in the film when Truman saw through the illusion, I couldn't relate to what he felt because I drew a blank. If I were in that situation I would've thought "does not compute" and sought help from the people I've always relied on when I encounter something I don't understand. 

      Due to my austism, I've always been dependent upon others in order to question my perception of reality. Even the way people act has always been alien to me, so I would never question anyone's behavior as weird. I'm a very trusting person who's lived a very sheltered life, and I kind of have to.

      I can't really relate to Truman, even if I had figured out the same things he did I would've just had a nervous breakdown. This story is about living in a bubble that's actually a prison designed to control you, and that's something I can't even imaging about my own bubble because I need it to survive.

      Maybe the movie is meant to appeal to your desire to run away, to leave a bad situation behind because you know there's something better out there. I, however, am terrified of what's out there and have only dared venture forth when I know exactly what to do. I probably need to work on this.
      ```

      - u/DaystarEld:
        ```
        To be fair, the situation is really, truly unordinary. I agree with you, if I started seeing the things Truman did I'd be more likely to see a therapist than think it was real. Partly because I work in mental health and partly because I have a life of normalcy to draw on, rather than a hundred minor coincidences and discrepancies to make me suspicious.

        But from the privileged position of the movie viewer, I can admire his resolve, since I know the conspiracy is actually real. "Be more adventurous" isn't always a positive, especially if someone is happy with their life.

    I love the movie, it's one of my all-time favorites. I love the concepts of anti-conformity and questioning authority/suburbia. It's not a rational story like we like here, it's more of a fable. But it has great concepts in it, loyalty and friendship, truth and reality, family and trust. I also probably get a perspective that's more unique than most, as I was a former christian and the movie is very metaphorical about losing your faith in god. 

    I find it fun and philosophically rich.
    ```

    - u/trekie140:
      ```
      I thought I was the guy with a unique perspective since I'm a self-critical introvert with autism who's spent his entire life trying to be more "normal" so I can be happy and accepted. Truman's character arc runs contrary to my own, so I don't understand it.
      ```

      - u/Polycephal_Lee:
        ```
        Ah I guess I can see that. A story about a man who finds societal acceptance insufficient might not be your thing if you really want societal acceptance.

  Cognitive science problems:

  * My new learning rule underperforms Naive Bayes in small dimensionalities

  * But it also systematically overperforms human classification in small dimensionalities.

  * But it keeps gaining performance as you add dimensionality (at least on this classification), at least up to somewhere around 20-50 features depending on how "structured" the category is, while Naive Bayes loses performance as dimensionality increases even at d in (0, 15).

  So it's incredibly interesting from the point of view of dealing with dimensionality, but still just not that good a model of the human subjects from the other paper.

  Welp, time to bullshit and make sure to submit to a more theory-focused venue.

  The Golden Record is one of the most deeply emotional things for me. Every so often, I listen to it, and it almost never fails to make me cry. Does anyone know of some SF that has related themes. Ideas about humanity reaching out into space to try and preserve it's history. Honestly any hard sci-fi would do, but that in particular effects me.
