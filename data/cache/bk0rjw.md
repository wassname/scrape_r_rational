  I generally like this story, but I'd advise people to wait until it's finished if you haven't picked it up yet.

  The story just has some nice worldbuilding and characters, but it's 640k words long and the pacing is off.  It feels like the story was 50% written at 600k, then realized that it had to finish the other 50% by 700k.

  It's still a recommend for me, but there's a probably high chance of it going off the rails.

    The author has actually commented on this. They got a little sick of/stuck in writing it and decided that wrapping it up quickly before running out of steam entirely and leaving it abandoned and unfinished.

    Would still recommend people give it a read (when complete), regardless.

  I liked this one a lot. The early chapters (after the prologue) are a bit of a slog, because Joffrey starts the fanfic as his charming canon self, and reading about his stupidities gets old really fast. But around chapter 7 he gets hit with character development after the reality of his situation sinks in and he hits rock bottom, and that's when he starts to become the likable protagonist he will remain throughout the rest of the story. I particularly enjoyed the Yi-Ti arc, though the TVTropes page [says](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/YMMV/PurpleDays) a lot of people thought it went on for too long.

  The awesomeness reaches a climax when Joffrey finds out the true nature of his curse and its relationship to the White Walkers. Unfortunately, shortly after that the fic adds another looper, and I didn't find the second looper nearly as interesting as the first, so my interest waned and that's when I dropped the story. Maybe I'll come back to it later, after it has progressed a bit more.

  In terms of rationality, I'm not sure it's a good fit for this sub. The characters are all [level 1 intelligent](https://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/level1intelligent), and there aren't any blatant plot holes or incoherent worldbuilding, but the same is true of the source material so it doesn't count as a deconstruction. The mysteries are not particularly solvable in advance by the reader, Joeffrey gets a lot of help from The Powers That Be, and he doesn't display any unusual cognitive techniques or scientific knowledge. On the other hand, the sub needs content, so we can probably let it slide.

    The first time I read it I dropped it at the exact same place. I restarted recently and finished it in one go. The second looper grows VERY fast, becoming powerfull and interesting. Also they have another exploration arc.

    That is the same place where I dropped off.

  This have been recommended in Monday Recommendations and have been generally been well received.

    I just searched this sub and did not found mentions, hence my post

      That makes sense. Last time it was recommended was three days ago though :P

  The prose is very stilted and awkward. Numerous grammatical mistakes, dialogue doesn't sound natural, inner monologues are awkward, suffers from the 'look how cool, but angsty and tortured but also so strong my protagonist is' syndrome. Justified somewhat by the concept, but seeing the near-end state of the loop is a terrible mistake to start with. You need to build to that, not keep forward. It's a payoff without a buildup. Author has to 'earn'that Joffrey. This is based only off of my reading of the prologue. I'm planning to give it 1-2 chapters to change my mind, but it's pretty bad so far.
  ```

  - u/edwardkmett:
    ```
    The author does a lot to earn a more redeemed Joffrey after that.
    ```

    - u/swagrabbit:
      ```
      So it has the same problems at least through chapter 7, but the author effectively builds on the concept and handles Joffrey as he is, and doesn't shift his character too far forward in each loop. I've been converted somewhat as it continues. Joffrey's derangement is interesting to read.
      ```

  I'm the middle of it. The loop mechanics and protag's actions aren't really too rational so I wouldn't put it in the category. In fact he does your typical fantasy protagonist inefficient happenstance road to coincidental victory thing quite a lot.

  Still an enjoyable read granted, minus the Yi Ti chapters which was an absolute slog.

  This fic is way more entertaining than the show is right now.

  Have a pretty good explanation for who white walkers are, on par with Preston Jacobs one ( The guy who read All Martin works and ties parallels through them all to make asoiaf theories).


  Alternates between trying to fix westeros and exploring the world, Westeros constantly punches Jeoffrey in the gut.

  &#x200B;

  Nice character relationships and growth.

    Do you have a link to the Preston theory? Because god damn if episode 3 is making me hate the entire series.

      there several parts and further you go funnier it becomes.

        Apparently George has written the same story a dozen times. Nice work if you can get it.

          Damn. Pretty much what David Eddings did. He also wrote about the fantasy recipe somewhere, maybe the Rivan Codex.

  As someone who only read the first GoT book, I'm a big fan of this fic. Good time loop mechanics, great wordbuilding, lovely focus on character growth.

    Didn't like it enough to continue the series or just tired of reading series that suffer Author Existence Failure? The world has pretty massive changes that literally start as the first book ends. (Before the dragons are born, there is no credible evidence magic exists or ever did, except that dragons used to exist and Valyrian steel is extra-special. After they are born, a bunch of things happen that only make sense if magic always existed and was just weak for a few centuries.)
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      At the time, my logic was "everyone talks about how much this series kills their favorite characters, and I have plenty of other ways to spend my time than reading something like that." Since that point (which was many years ago) the former reason has faded from relevance, but the latter has kept me from revisiting the books.
      ```

      - u/GeneralExtension:
        ```
        The problem I had reading the first book was, in order to achieve an effect when you kill off a character, you must first make that action meaningful. GoT killed the characters off before you could get attached, so things were pretty meaningless, and character development went nowhere other than the graveyard. (And so I stopped there.)

  Loved the lemons.

  Currently in the Yi-Ti arc, which, I agree with the TVTropes opinion mentioned elsewhere that it's going on too long.

  I'm interested to see how it resolves the various prophecies ("prince who was promised," "gold will be their shrouds," etc.) with "Strange Joffrey."

  The writing/grammar is unreadably bad tbh
  ```

  - u/ToaKraka:
    ```
    At a glance, the latest chapter (chapter 66) looks *much* less illiterate, so it presumably gets better gradually.
    ```

    - u/ArcTruth:
      ```
      If I have to read through 30 chapters of this before it gets bearable it is not worth it. I damn near dropped Metaworld Chronicles for exactly this reason, and the first 50 of that being edited hard was the only reason it got a chance to begin with.

  How much knowledge of the story would you recommend having before reading this? It looks interesting, but i haven't been keeping up with the books (or the TV series).
  ```

  - u/WilyCoyotee:
    ```
    None needed, honestly. I haven't watched anything or read any of the books/ episodes, just having simple knowledge from osmosis/memes, and the fic is pretty dang good in my opinion despite that lack of knowledge.
    ```

  - u/erwgv3g34:
    ```
    The fic begins after the Purple Wedding. If you're going by the books, that takes place in the third novel (_A Storm of Swords_) of _A Song of Ice and Fire_. If you're going by the show, the episode in question is S4E02 "The Lion and the Rose" of _Game of Thrones_.
