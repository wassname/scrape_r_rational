  So far as I know that's just someone holding on to what they perceive as a special skill or authority. Petty, but I don't think it's a fallacy.

    You just did it!

    You just gave an answer to what was clearly a made-up example trying to illustrate a larger question (what is this called), when I obviously only wanted the answer to the larger question.

    I'm starting to think the entire world is trolling me on this particular thing.

      Ah, I think I understand what you're getting at now: missing the forest for the trees? Or, more accurately, missing the argument for the analogy?

      In a way, it's almost a self-inflicted Red Herring, or perhaps a subconscious form of Strawman? As I think about it, I am more convinced that Strawman most accurately describes this scenario, as someone intentionally (or subconsciously) misunderstands you and focuses on your individual statements, rather than your overall arguement.

  There is actually a fallacy called [Refuting the example](https://books.google.ie/books?id=zGvOBAAAQBAJ&pg=PT112&dq=%22refuting+the+example%22&source=bl&ots=oIbvkopTk_), but that applies to the unjustified rejection of an argument, just because a supporting example was shown to be false.
