  Well, starting (second chapter, but still the start) your murder mystery web serial with a meta chapter where a murder mystery web serial writer talks about all the difficulties of writing murder mystery web serials is...an interesting choice. It's definitely piqued my interest, like a lot. 

  I'm not sure how the meta narration by By is going to work in the rest of the story, but so far I like it. It's fun. Especially the barb at including religious arguments in a story while doing exactly that.

  I'm eager for this story to get through the obligatory character introductions and start in on the rules for the game. The stakes have *mostly* been established, but the mechanical nature of the conflict is unclear for now.

  I'm also not sure how I feel about the meta elements, though I think it's best that they're worn on the sleeve early on so that readers can calibrate. What particular *kind* of meta remains to be seen; meta for the lampshade hanging, meta for postmodernism, or meta for deconstruction/reconstruction? I'm *interested*, but I'm also a bit leery, if that makes sense.

      I definitely appreciate the story being upfront about what it is. I think I've probably talked about signaling to the audience ahead of time, and how important it is, because getting the wrong audience is frustrating for both them and for you (and in turn, can give bad reviews and/or word of mouth, which makes it harder to build an audience).

      And yes, when I wrote my thoughts, I assumed that we had another few chapters of character introductions, which I'm fine with (but would be more fine with if I could just read them now rather than waiting).

        I hope you can empathise with everyone who reads your own stories \^^
