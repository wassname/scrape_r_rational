## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  You possess the ability to capture an object copy (a *Memory*) and attach it to *Anchor*. Anchor can later be activated to manifest a stored Memory at the same position relative to Anchor, with the same relative speed.

  * Objects can be "memorized" from ~200 m distance.
  * You can "memorize" bullets (and other rapidly moving objects), if you roughly now where the original bullet will fly.
  * Memory will dissolve and evaporate few hours after its creation.
  * You have to be near Anchor to use it (in ~1 m radius). Memory can be manifested as long as Anchor is mostly intact.
  * Memory can't be manifested inside living beings and solid bodies.
  * Mass is uniformly lost from an Anchor to restore a Memory.
  * If Memory has kinetic energy, it is taken from Anchor's heat energy.
  * If there is not enough mass in Anchor or if Anchor temperature is lower than temperature of the surroundings, your body mass and heat are taken (this can harm internal organs and induce hypothermia).


  How would you munchkin this ability?


  Will you be able to escape from heavily guarded prison if nobody knows about your ability? If everyone knows about it?

    Are there any limitations on what kinds of "objects" you can copy? For instance, can you copy humans? Or yourself for that matter? Can copies of yourself then also produce more object copies? Can object copies also be anchors, and thus allow you to mass produce copies of yourself at an exponential rate by having copies make copies of other copies that are anchored to other copies? 

    Does the anchor have to be willing? Can you anchor an unwilling subject and thus rob it of mass/heat? 

    > Will you be able to escape from heavily guarded prison if nobody knows about your ability? If everyone knows about it?

    Well first, walls and bars will mean nothing. Use them as anchors and produce copies of anything to rob the anchors of mass until they disappear.  

    Depending on how fast you can use your ability, bullets may also be useless: You can dynamically create and destroy walls around yourself, blocking any bullets fired at you.

    Suffocation, Dehydration, and Starvation will also mean nothing, since you can produce copies of oxygen, water, and food, from your own lungs/blood/flesh if you have to. Though I wonder what happens if the memory of oxygen dissolves while still in your body. Huh. Sounds dangerous. Change of plans, copy oxygen to mass murder any prison guards when the oxygen copies dissolve.

    If everyone knows about my ability, escape becomes impossible: they would simply put me in permanent cryogenic sleep, rendering me unconscious and unable to use my ability.

      > Are there any limitations on what kinds of "objects" you can copy?

      Almost no limitations. You can get extremely specific with memorization (for example, memorize only copper from bronze) but this procedure is much more exhausting and requires long rest.

      > For instance, can you copy humans? Or yourself for that matter?

      (This idea is so cool I just can't refuse it. Below is a more detailed answer I copied from my response to /u/Gurkenglas)

      Let's say that living manifestations almost immediately die from one of a hundred different causes. If you can prepare the necessary equipment (and get lucky with death cause), you can keep your manifestation alive for an hour and they will be able to use this power.

      In this case, you can go exponential but the process will become increasingly expensive.

      > Copy oxygen to mass murder any prison guards when the oxygen copies dissolve.

      This is awesome. You don't even need toxic chemicals to kill people.

      > If everyone knows about my ability, escape becomes impossible: they would simply put me in permanent cryogenic sleep, rendering me unconscious and unable to use my ability. 

      Well, someone might be tempted to wake you up for interrogation. Just for a few minutes, surely nothing dangerous will happen...

        Hmmm...

        Other really horrible potential abuses:

        1) Gas compression: 

        You can't manifest copies in solids, but you can in gases, so... get a sealed container of air, copy the air in the container, anchor it to the container (or something nearby), mass manifest. Now the inside of the container becomes super pressurized, allowing you to do all kinds of horrible things. For example, you could also add a bunch of small metal thumbtacks to the container before pressurizing it. Then you can pressurize it to the limit, and use the container as a frag grenade.

        2) World destruction: Memorize the atmosphere (it's an object you are most certainly touching), use the Earth as the anchor (go outdoors, now it's an object you are touching). Then manifest. Since the atmosphere is a gas, you can manifest another copy of the atmosphere in itself. That takes a massive amount of heat and mass, but luckily, the Earth is surrounded by outer space, which has barely any heat or mass, so the heat and mass won't come from your own body. The amount of gas in the atmosphere doubles, while the Earth's solid mass decreases by the same amount. Whatever happens next can't possibly be good for anyone on the planet.

        On the other hand, there are some good uses:

        1) Improved rockets:

        Currently, one of the worst problems with rockets is that rockets need fuel to push themselves out of the Earth, so they have to carry that fuel, which in turn means they need more fuel to push themselves more, which in turn means they need to carry more fuel, which in turn... ad infinitum. So currently what happens is that rockets carry huge containers of fuel up with them. With your ability, this problem is somewhat mitigated: you still need to carry a lot of mass up, since your ability needs to drain mass from an anchor to produce fuel, but you no longer need the huge containers. Just carry up some kind of really dense material and you can use that as an anchor to produce large amounts of fuel. (Don't make any oxygen though, since we don't want to kill everyone on Earth when the copies dissolve.)

        It also makes the rockets much much safer, since the fuel containers you replace are actually extremely dangerous: a small leak in the fuel tank can and has caused entire rockets to explode.

        2) Constant sea levels:

        Climate Change is melting the ice caps, which will cause sea levels to rise and submerge many cities. With your ability, you can use an ocean as an anchor, and manifest copies of large objects, draining the mass of the oceans to keep the sea levels constant. You may want to check with a bunch of scientists to make sure that this is safe though.

        3) Exoplanet colonization:

        If you live long enough, you may be vital to the colonization of exoplanets. Making habitable zones on other planets presents many challenges, but most of them we can currently fix. Food, water, air can be brought over from Earth. Temperature can be controlled, using vacuums to insulate colonies from the outside. With technology not too far in the future, it wouldn't be surprising if much of a planet's surface can even be terraformed. But gravity? Gravity is going to be hard. In order to reduce gravity on super large planets, you need to reduce mass. The only semi-realistic way to achieve that is to carry tons of material out of a planet's gravity well and off into space. Which is of course, insanely expensive and inefficient, and it would probably be easier to just find another planet.

        With your ability though, you can just make that mass disappear. Use the planet as an anchor, and spam manifest copies of large objects. The mass of the planet will be converted into the copies, then converted into harmless gas, and finally flow into another dimension, effectively reducing the mass of the planet and reducing it's gravity.

          Amazing ideas, although Earth destruction doesn't seem to be feasible. You have 200 meter limitation, thus you can only memorize a small part of the atmosphere.


          You will still be able to slowly increase atmospheric pressure, but it will be fairly slow process, so concerned terrestrials might be able to stop you.

    Use memory on a block of frozen oxygen.  Vaporize it.  A few hours later everyone drops dead in a medically incomprehensible way as 79% of the oxygen atoms that they breathed in turn into Anchor atoms (or just disappear with the Anchor regaining mass, depending on how this works).

    You can also burn the Memory and a few hours later it vanishes and you have a cloud of free oxygen atoms (lots of applications for this, not necessarily bombs).

    Also, abuse the "taken from Anchor's heat energy" part for free cryogenics.
    ```

  - u/mg115ca:
    ```
    I have 3 objects called A B and C. I make a memory of C anchored to B, then make a memory of B anchored to A. If I manifest the memory of B, does the manifested copy have a memory of C? (not sure if there's an exploit there...) 

    When manifested memories expire, where does the mass/energy go? Back into the anchor? What if the energy has been transferred to/from another object in the meantime? What if the manifested object is more than 200 meters away? What if the manifested object has acted as an anchor itself for a new memory and spent it's heat on that? 

    Manifested memories displace can't appear inside people or solid objects, but if liquids or gas are okay, do they displace the fluid on appearance? What if the memory is itself less dense than the fluid (say, a helium balloon underwater or a vacuum thermos)?  

    Manifested objects' kinetic energy (including heat presumably) is taken from the anchor, but not potential chemical energy. Anchor is a spent battery, memory is a full one, when manifested it takes all the mass from the anchor and turns it into the memory. 

    What happens when a manifested memory is dramatically colder than the anchor but slightly smaller in mass? Say, a 100.1 g anchor heated to 1000 degrees Kelvin manifesting a 100g memory at room temperature. Does the excess heat in the anchor go into the tiny .1g of matter remaining? What if the masses are reversed and there is no remaining mass for the energy to go into? 

    Pretty sure the rules don't allow directly storing the memory of an object inside itself, but you can get around that with an additional object. Call them A and B. B anchors the memory of A, then manifests it as A*. A anchors A*. Presto, an object stored inside itself.
