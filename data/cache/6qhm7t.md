  I decided to buy and read the book because I love stories that involve the [Library of Babel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Library_of_Babel) concept in one way or another.

  It was well written and I personally enjoyed it, but I don't see how it's actually rationalist? The characters are vivid, but I don't see how anyone is behaving in a way that appears intelligent/rational to me.

  [Summary: ](#s "It simply takes the Library of Babel and turns it into a hell where an Abramic-like God from the Zoroastrian religion sends individuals who didn't worship it. Each person has to find a book that chronicles their life story before they can leave hell for heaven. There isn't any ending where the protagonist finds the book after a journey of self-discovery like I was hoping. It simply ends with the protagonist contemplating the bleak hopelessness of his task as he keeps searching.")

    Thinking about this story, if I were placed in the same situation as the main character, [I would ](#s "have attempted to escape by writing my own book of my life instead of looking for it. Everyone has been gifted with a perfect memory to remember their lives, the kiosk can provide any food so it can be leveraged into edible paper and inks, and I have all the time needed to contemplate about my life and to write as honestly as possible about my flaws and strengths. After all, all books already exist, why should I spend time looking for it when I can just write it myself?")

      [I thought the same](#s " I was really annoyed that not one of the university people had started trying to write their own books yet. Or try to munchkin food requests. They seemed to be able to get dishes and such. Why not try to make a bike with metal pizza trays?")

      [edit on further thought](#s " I'm not sure if they were able to get metal but it did seem like  they could retrieve quite a few things. One thing being glass, a shot glass was requested and I doubt that was anything other than glass. One thing that really bothers me was that they never discussed if the surrounding they were trapped in was destructible. Why did no one ever try to knock over a book case? It mentioned that the railings and frames of the bed were metal, could those not be bent or changed? Also why did no one think of fire during the whole time they were there? I know the author hinted at subtle influences on the mind but I really hate that. Everything off with the story can be chalked up to there being mental compulsion not do something. " )
