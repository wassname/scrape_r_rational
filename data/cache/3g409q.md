  I guess this blows away that Poul Anderson (I think) story where a spaceship saves itself by reaching the level it floats in a gas-giant atmosphere.

  I only recall one line in the story now, _"Like a bubble in a densitometer, the <name of ship> floated"_. Utterly ungoogle-able. Anyone remember this one?

  I love the what-if posts but Randall has clearly taken on more than he can chew since the update schedule has gotten completely bonkers. Even after a several month hiatus, he is apparently not doing regular weekly posts anymore. 

  I realize that as a consumer of his products (and one who doesn't even pay at that!) I have very little right to complain about scheduling, but I honestly wish he would go to a less frequent but more regular schedule.

  All that being said, perhaps one of the best comics for rational fiction type stuff.

  Everybody probably knows about it already, but I figured it belongs on this subreddit.
