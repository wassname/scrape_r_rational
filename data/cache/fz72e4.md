## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  Rebound: you can cause things to bounce off your body. When your power is "on", any matter, wave, or photon that impacts your body will rebound. This effect gives your body the appearance of a perfect mirror when your power is active. You can choose which body parts to apply this power to, but be careful; using it on your eyes makes you blind as photons bounce off, on your inner ear makes you deaf, etc. 

  Variant 1: The speed with which an object bounces off is equal to the *relative* velocity between you and the object. This means that if you punch a brick wall, the brick wall molecules flee from your fist at the average velocity of your punch, with predictably explosive results. This variant means that using it on the soles of your feet while standing causes you to plummet through the earth, as the molecules bounce away from your feet. 

  Variant 2, less powerful, more challenging to munchkin: objects that bounce off you still transfer momentum, though you don't suffer negative effects from the sudden acceleration. This means you can't punch through walls, you instead bounce off them. 

  Variant 3, still more challenging: as Variant 2, but you *do* suffer the effects of sudden acceleration. Your power will somewhat distribute the impact of e.g. bullets so they don't shatter your ribs, but the acceleration can still give you a concussion or whiplash or snap your spine.

    \*Watches blood rebound from that body part, killing yourself?

    Or I guess your own body is immune to your power? 

    In any case, all 3 variants will allow you to push a rocket from inside it, meaning less fuel necessary since your rebound power produces energy ex nihilo.

      My bad, it only works on the surface of the body part.

  Someone you're close to (partner, best friend, house mate, whatever) admits that they have mind control powers after you confront them with suspicions of the same. 

  They tell you they have the following limitations:

  - The effect lasts ~2 minutes (so if you're ordered to dance, you'd dance for two minutes and then stop)

  - The order is strong but not infinitely strong: a loving parent can't be ordered to kill their child, but all but The Most Pure and Fervent Believer would break a (non-violent) rule of their religion

  - It requires eye contact and sunglasses grant immunity (blind people are immune at some level of "not being able to see their eyes")

  - They claim they haven't ever done it to you

  - You have reason to believe that they have mind control powers (you did confront them, after all), but you don't have reason to believe any of the above *specifically* especially given the source

  Discussion questions:

  - How can you prove to yourself that they haven't mind controlled you? (e.g. if your partner mind controlled you into dating them, that would be a problem). At this point, you *feel* as though you genuinely like them. Do you care? 

  - What information do you verify? How?

  - Okay, how do you use your friend's power?

  And finally, for people who don't want to participate in this thinly veiled attempt to help me write my story and just write how they'd end up with a volcano lair full of catgirl waifus:

  - If you were the friend with this mind control power, with the limitations as stated above, how would you use it?
  ```

  - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
    ```
    >The effect lasts \~2 minutes (so if you're ordered to dance, you'd dance for two minutes and then stop)

    Do the 2 minutes have to be consecutive? Can the friend mind control a person more than once? What about mind controlling them several times in a row to extend the 2 minutes?

    >How can you prove to yourself that they haven't mind controlled you? (e.g. if your partner mind controlled you into dating them, that would be a problem). At this point, you *feel* as though you genuinely like them. Do you care?

    Evaluate how useful I could be for them were I totally mind controlled, and also compare how useful I am to them right now. If I am very useful to them if mind controlled and exactly as useful to them right now, then I have been mind controlled. If I am very useful to them if mind controlled but nowhere as useful to them right now, then I am not currently mind controlled, but I could be soon or could have been. If I am utterly useless to them, then I haven't been mind controlled and probably never will be, because why would they bother?

    Note: By useful I mean, relative to other people they could mind control instead. For example, if I am much richer than everyone else near me, that raises the probability of me being mind controlled for the money. If I'm much poorer than someone else near me, then the probability that I have been mind controlled for money becomes practically nil.

    Simply put, a mind controller isn't very different from a con artist. Most of the signs are the  same.

    &#x200B;

    Another approach that can yield great returns is to look for evidence that your friend has been in your life for a long time. If you can't find anything that suggests your friend has known you for longer than say, a week? That's a very strong sign that your entire relationship with them is faked, they have messed with your memories. On the other hand, if you find evidence everywhere that they have known you for years? That's a pretty good sign for you. If it has taken literal years to mind control you, why would they have done that instead of going for someone easier? The con artist rule applies again, no one will invest years of effort to scam someone when there are plenty of easier targets around (unless for some reason you are uniquely useful).

      Thanks for the great response - I especially like the very astute observation that your level of usefulness to them is important. If they've used their MC powers to become a billionaire and you're a friend from high school and you go roller blading together then yeah, why do they need to MC you.

      > Do the 2 minutes have to be consecutive? 

      Think of the power as being an order that "decays" after two minutes. So you can't say "unlock this prison cell door and then when you go home put your keys in your letterbox" because the order would be "over". 

      > Can the friend mind control a person more than once?

      Yes (so they claim), though I think repeated MC would result in someone being changed mentally. 

      >  What about mind controlling them several times in a row to extend the 2 minutes?

      That is fine (so they claim), but they state that it's difficult: 2 minutes is a "maximum" and it can wear off earlier or rarely slightly later, so if you order someone to dance, they could stop anywhere between minute one and minute two, so if it's important they don't stop you need to be ready to refresh the order; or to just be constantly screaming at them, every 45 seconds, to keep doing X.

    >How can you prove to yourself that they haven't mind controlled you?

    Record them commanding you to tell them if you've ever been MC'd. Only works if the MC'd version of you is able to answer honestly AND the MC requires a verbal command.

    If those aren't true (or you don't know if they are true) then you could request a third party to place a hidden camera in your shared space to catch future MC activity. 

    You could also meet with old friends and ask about your likes and dislikes. Preferences change over time, but if there is enough disjoint (you picked up a ton of new sexual kinks, you went from being messy to extremely tidy, etc) you can assume tampering. You can also look for implanted memories (assuming those last beyond the 2 minutes) that couldn't have happened.

    Pretty much any verification would require an unbiased 3rd party acting as independently and disantly as possible. Assume you could be compromised and give them up. Best would be if you could keep their identity secret from yourself, too (text-only anonymous communication? ).

    >do you care?

    Yeah, in all cases I require verification. 

    >how do you use your power?

    Depends on my circumstances and motivation, but at the very least I am going to make some money and have some fun.

    The issue is that MC is incredibly unethical in many cases. It's right up there with rape in terms of violation when used to coerce. That said, there are uses that I wouldn't consider a violation: making sex more enjoyable for an already willing sexual partner, talking someone out of suicide, motivating a friend to work out (who already wanted to work out), stopping a violent crime, etc. I personally wouldn't hesitate to use my power casually for things like this.

    Then there's gray area stuff. Getting a better than normal (but not outside the realm of possibility) deal on a car. Getting hired for a job. Getting a girl's phone number. Pranking someone (for example, telling some jerk to poop himself). This is definitely not moral behavior but a little bit of it is probably okay. If I had MC powers you bet I'd do at least a little of this.

    And then there's the sociopath stuff. Rape. Major theft. Assisted suicide. Politics (especially if the power works across TV, you could absolutely dominate a nation while you are awake. If it works via recording too, you could broadcast "obey" commands continuously and have pretty much uncontested power). Any one of these actions pretty much instantly makes the character irredeemable.

  **Faith; you can deeply believe anything you want and be sure that's true.** 

  You can believe in anything you want and you will immediatelly feel like it was true. You can change even your perception of pain and pleasure, of good and bad, etc, maybe even of time.

  Of course, you can't really change anything except your own mind, you can't do magic, you can't get any external information about world that way, discover physics, etc....

  You're just god of your own mind and manipulate it as you wish.

  How would you live with it and what kinds of goals would you try to pursue with this ability?
  ```

  - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:

    This is a pretty dangerous power. Like, this is pretty much how you become Voldemort from Seventh Horcrux if you aren't extremely careful. You change your mind, then the new you with the changed mind changes it again, then again, and again, and soon you're totally insane and fall for your own lies.

    The safest use is probably to just change your perception of time. If you can increase the speed of your thoughts without any side effects, that means you can get a lot of thinking done much faster than normal. That's great for all kinds of tasks that involve large amounts of thinking, like doing math homework or solving crime or writing novels.

    Other than that, I don't think I would use this power much, not even to cure my depression. It's just too dangerous.

    This sounds like it might serve as a memory aid. The things you learn from reliable sources are things you'd believe to be true, and, for this power to work, you'd have to be unable to simply forget those things. This might be pretty handy when studying for a test.
