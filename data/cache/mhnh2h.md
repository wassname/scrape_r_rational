## [RST][C][HSF][DC][TH] "Non-Player Character" by Eliezer Yudkowsky: "I looked at the screen for a few moments. Rilanya's rendered graphic was looking at my point-of-view with a pleading expression. Plot point, I thought to myself, and typed: 'Anything, Rilanya.'"

  I think the hiccough in this story is where he spends a few hours googling the state of NPC AI and doesn't come across the apparently publicly available modules that have been created specifically for the purpose of pretending to be conscious NPCs.  If she could just google how to integrate a "woke" Convo AI with the game API he should have run across them in his own search. I know she kind of addresses it and it's a plot device, just is a bit of forced ignorance
