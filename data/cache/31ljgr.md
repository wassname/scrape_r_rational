## Help finding a gravity story

### Post:

There was either a story or a podcast I found about earth's gravity shifting 90 degrees. East is now down, and what happens from there. Help?

    This was one of his?! No wonder it was awesomely deep.

  For what it's worth, it is possible to have eastward gravity like that. It just can't be sustained. You can cause it by accelerating the Earth west. It's similar to how if you run an increasing electric current clockwise through a wire, it will induce a counterclockwise current around it.

  If you sustain it, you get an interesting problem they don't mention. As a photon falls, its energy grows, which means that it's frequency increases. Since it can't change the number of periods the electromagnetic wave goes through, it must change the time. This is gravitational time dilation.

  Suppose you have a fiber-optic cable wrapping around the horizon. Let's say it starts at 500 THz. Gravitational time dilation works out so that once it passes around the equator once, its frequency is about 500.000002 THz, which is an extra 2 MHz. It takes about 0.134 seconds for the signal to get around the first time. Let's pretend it's 0.1 seconds, for simplicity. So the sending laser pulses 50 trillion times while you're waiting for the signal. But since the receiving signal gets an extra two million pulses per second, after 25 million seconds it catches up. Any signal you send will be received instantly. Wait longer, and you'll start receiving pulses before you send them. You have created a time machine. If you crated that gravitational gradient by accelerating the spin of the Earth, it's a [Tipler cylinder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tipler_cylinder).

    >A __Tipler cylinder__, also called a __Tipler time machine__, is a [hypothetical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothetical) object [theorized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory) to be a potential mode of [time travel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_travel)â€”although results have shown that a Tipler cylinder could only allow time travel if its length were infinite or with the existence of negative energy (see the discussion of Hawking's proof below).

    >The Tipler cylinder was discovered as a solution to the equations of general relativity by [Willem Jacob van Stockum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willem_Jacob_van_Stockum)  in 1936 and [Kornel Lanczos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kornel_Lanczos)  in 1924, but not recognized as allowing [closed timelike curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_timelike_curves)  until an analysis by [Frank Tipler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Tipler)  in 1974. Tipler showed in his 1974 paper, "Rotating Cylinders and the Possibility of Global Causality Violation" that in a [spacetime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime) containing a massive, infinitely long [cylinder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylinder_(geometry\)) which was spinning along its longitudinal [axis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_axis), the cylinder should create a [frame-dragging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame-dragging) effect. This frame-dragging effect warps spacetime in such a way that the [light cones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_cone) of objects in the cylinder's proximity become tilted, so that part of the light cone then points backwards along the time axis on a space time diagram. Therefore a [spacecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft) accelerating sufficiently in the appropriate direction can travel backwards through time along a [closed timelike curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_timelike_curve) or CTC. 

    >CTCs are associated, in [Lorentzian manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudo-Riemannian_manifold) which are interpreted physically as [spacetimes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime), with the possibility of causal anomalies such as going back in time and [potentially shooting your own grandfather](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandfather_paradox), although paradoxes might be avoided using some constraint such as the [Novikov self-consistency principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novikov_self-consistency_principle). They have an unnerving habit of appearing in some of the most important exact solutions in general relativity, including the [Kerr vacuum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerr_metric) (which models a rotating black hole) and the [van Stockum dust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Stockum_dust) (which models a cylindrically symmetrical configuration of rotating pressureless fluid or [dust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dust_solution)).

    God, I love this sub! I love that i can throw a half-thought-out vague summary like like that, and not only does somebody find the exact story, but then someone else deep dives the physics like you just did! :)
