  [Break Them All](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/break-them-all-original-precross.12960/) - it's just a story about a guy learning about and playing around with a computer program-like magic system without much of a plot. Still surprisingly good with a very slow updating rate. About one chapter every 4 to 6 months, but it just updated last week which is why I'm posting about it here.

  [El Manisero ](https://archiveofourown.org/works/13617231) - A BnHa fanfic where Sero runs a peanut cartel at UA. Despite the utterly ridiculous premise, every event has a logical outcome and is one of the best blends of rational and comedy I have ever seen. If this is a movie, I would buy it to watch over and over.

  [Vronsurd](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/7725915/Vronsurd) - I needed my RWBY fanfic fix to feed my RWBY addiction and this guy is writing some amazing RWBY stories. I stumbled on him yesterday and sped-read through 'The Shield of Vale', 'The Navigator', and 'Guitar Huntsman', and all of them were really good reads even though they are just in the starting chapters.

  [Ricochet](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7958343/1/) - It's a hysterical Naruto fanfic and I couldn't stop laughing while reading how the characters all verbally abuse each other in the name of Friendship^TM. The first chapter looks like it's a high-school AU of Naruto, but it really, really is not and is perfectly in line with canon. So I recommend giving it a try.

  If anyone wants more RWBY or Boku no Hero Academia fanfic recs, I would be happy to oblige. Just let me know if you want anything in particular or if I should just throw out my favorites.

    I can second the rec for Break Them All. I’ve been reading it for the last three years and it’s quite enjoyable.

    I just binged through Break Them All, and my god was it beautiful. I cannot wait for it to update again, and would love if it was posted here when it updates.

      Sure, I can do so.

      ```

  - u/LucidityWaver:
    ```
    Thanks for the recs.

    Probably being a bit hopeful, but any recommendations for Boku no Hero Academia fics with similar quality to [Erased Potential](https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12522681/1/)?
    ```

    - u/xamueljones:
      ```
      Asking for something similar quality is a little vague since I don't know what you look for in a good story, but I can share the best ones.

      * Anything by [simkjrs](https://archiveofourown.org/users/simkjrs/pseuds/simkjrs) because the guy is the best at writing stories with the perfect blend of sarcastic and touching.

      * Anything by [PitViperOfDoom](https://archiveofourown.org/users/PitViperOfDoom/pseuds/PitViperOfDoom) becasue the guy is a fantastic writer who writes really good world-building or 'For Want of a Nail' fics. My faves are 'Yesterday Upon the Stair', 'break your bones but not your promises', and 'Divenire'.

      * [Coloured Bricks, Pick-Up Sticks](https://archiveofourown.org/works/12185283/chapters/27663255) is about Izuku with a quirk to be warm and performing reckless and life-endangering scientific experimentation to be a hero.

      * [UA Unsolved](https://archiveofourown.org/works/13253055) - Spin-off of 'Yesterday Upon the Stair where the UA dorms are haunted and the Class 1A go ghost-hunting like Ghost Busters.

      * [For Want of a Toe Joint](https://archiveofourown.org/works/11339718/chapters/25378848) - Where Izuku has a quirk and it goes unnoticed until months after he's gotten into UA. It's great because the story investigates deeply into the mechanics of how quirks work.

      * If you want more fanfics, try Ao3's collections such as [The Great Ones](https://archiveofourown.org/collections/TheGreatOnes) or [Awesome BnHa Multi-Chapter Fics](https://archiveofourown.org/collections/Awesome_BnHA_MultiChapter_Fics)
      ```

      - u/LucidityWaver:
        ```
        Yeah, definitely vague, but thank you for running with it anyway!

        After having a couple of rough days and feeling a bit sick all morning, I would have had a bit of trouble identifying the elements I would emphasise as enjoyable for me and the same for articulating that information. So I *really* appreciate it.
        ```

        - u/xamueljones:
          ```
          No problem, enjoy the reading!
          ```

  - u/SkyTroupe:
    ```
    Ricochet was absolutely incredible. Do you know how frequently he updates?
    ```

    - u/xamueljones:
      ```
      Once in a blue moon. It's taken the guy six years to write 16 chapters, so it's roughly once every five to six months, but the last two chapters updated relatively close to each other and he's about two or three chapters from finishing judging by the pacing.

      I can post to this subreddit once it's done if you want?
      ```

      - u/SkyTroupe:
        ```
        I would love that. This has brought about feelings I havent felt since I first read fanfiction. So much raw emotional punch.

        Also, Id love any and all BNHA recs you have.
        ```

        - u/xamueljones:
          ```
          I already posted the best ones in another comment in this thread, but there's some more that I would recommend. Just remember that I'm not as willing to guarantee the quality. They're either not as good, but still worth reading or I haven't read past the first few chapters yet.

          * [Blood Sex Sugar Magic](https://archiveofourown.org/works/13091760/chapters/29950974) - Izuku decides to try being a hero...with Himiko Toga's help.

          * [If I Only Had a Heart](https://archiveofourown.org/works/13705821/chapters/31483173) - Izuku decides he will be a hero despite being quirkless. Similar to Erased Potential in concept, except Izuku is a genius like Tony Stark.

          * [With What Was Left Behind](https://archiveofourown.org/works/13803339/chapters/31736502) - Similar to 'If I Only Had a Heart' above, except Izuku while attempting to be a quirkless super-hero, doesn't attend UA.

          * [Something Like a Star](https://archiveofourown.org/works/12897003/chapters/29463207) - Izuku struggles through life with an empathy quirk.

          * [Something Borrowed](https://archiveofourown.org/works/13918209/chapters/32032938) - Izuku has a quirk where he can borrow other people's quirk like All for One can.

          * [How Shinsou Hitoshi Became The Greatest Hero Ever \(Or Something\)](https://archiveofourown.org/works/10801047/chapters/23962797) - Shinsou asks Aizawa to train him into someone who can be a hero despite a mind-control quirk.

          * [We All Can Be Heroes](https://archiveofourown.org/works/14053671/chapters/32372736) - Izuku doesn't meet All Might or go to UA. He becomes a paramedic to be a hero.

  ```
  [Transdimensional Brain Chip](http://brainchip.thecomicseries.com/)! If you *really* dislike dumb characters, bad art, and stories written in English by ESL people then this definitely isn't the story for you.

  However, I found it really funny and it approaches a lot of rational themes in a way that was really enjoyable, to me at least. Think SMBC more than Time Braid. Also, it's pretty short, so you won't lose more than a couple hours.
  ```

  - u/GaBeRockKing:
    ```
    I second this. Don't let the bad art put you off; the story more than compensates.
    ```

    - u/trekie140:
      ```
      If you can get past that art, would you be willing to give [The Dragon Doctors](http://dragondoctors.dhscomix.com/archives/comic/ch-7-page-1-last-victim) a chance? It’s my favorite webcomic and I want more people to check it out since it’s completely rational, but the artwork is a turn off for a lot of people. The premise is basically Scrubs meets Doctor Who.

      The link is to a prequel arc that takes place before the first chapter. It’s more self-contained than any other chapter, introduces the world in a more natural way than the first chapter, and the even author considers it to be the point where they got good at writing the characters.
      ```

      - u/Flashbunny:
        ```
        To anyone considering this who's immediately put off by the pencil artwork at the start: if you can power through the first chapter, the artstyle shifts to just mediocre digital artwork with colours, which makes keeping track of who's who *much* easier.

      ```

      - u/xamueljones:
        ```
        /u/yagsuomynona misspoke. It's not intellectual Turing test, but rather [Ideological Turing Test](https://praxtime.com/2014/05/27/ideological-turing-test/). It's a test where any ideologist or politician writes two essays, one essay arguing for their side and another essay for the opponent's side. If a neutral judge can't identify which essay the test-taker supports, then it's a pass.

        Saying someone fails to pass the test for something like Christianity or Buddhism implies that they don't understand the religion or simply opposes the religion without knowing anything about it.

        However, the part I don't understand is who is /u/yagsuomynona referring to? The author or the main character? Because one can argue that they both failed the test.
        ```

        - u/yagsuomynona:
          ```
          Yeah, misspoke. And I'm referring to the author. Murdering people that are Christian so that they go to heaven is extremely utilitarian and extremely at odds with the commandment "thou shalt not kill". It is so far outside of Christian moral reasoning, and most natural human moral reasoning, that even ascribing the belief to a cult is absurd. He's basically just setting up those damn theists as the insane and unreasonable bad guys.
          ```

          - u/xamueljones:
            ```
            Maybe, but remember that it's only the main character who goes to such insane lengths. Every other religious individual presented in the story are reasonable in comparison. Although...there was a scene where everyone in a religious group literally wears a fish taped to their foreheads, so you're probably right anyway.
            ```

          - u/RMcD94:
            ```
            But if heaven was true it would be a good thing. One person sins so the rest of us can go to heaven. If anything it perfectly fits with jesus example of self sacrifice
            ```

  So I have recently decided to compile a list of all of my favorite pieces of fanfiction and try to reread pretty much all of them, especially the ones I haven't read in a while. I mainly talk about them in the TTS server, but I will be keeping a [Google Drive doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hJr3NA92ZTYBmJZSkx45_mBLfmSw0fJQ3Ny3kDxq1Dc/edit?usp=drivesdk) going and keep it updated with the reviews I write out every time I finish a fic. Only have gone through two so far, but this list will only grow. Anything on that list to begin with was good enough for me to remember it fondly, so people are free to look for recs there.

  One of those fics is a very recent find, **[Love Novels](https://archiveofourown.org/works/9131719/chapters/20750566)**. This is a Love Live sequel romance fic, set two years after the conclusion of the original Love Live anime, starting right as Maki graduates from high school and enters University with the goal of fulfilling her parent's wishes and becoming a doctor. The main narrative thread revolves around Maki's overachieving academic standards and stubborn sense of pride starting to slowly grind her down as stresses pile up higher and higher, while her best friend Nico does everything in her power to stop Maki from reaching her breaking point.

  This is also, without exaggeration, the best romance fic I have ever read. I read the whole thing essentially in one sitting, spellbound the whole way through, and it just **melted** me. You'd expect the fic's emotional focus on Maki's struggles and stresses to make it really depressing, but Nico's constant emotional support stops it from ever overwhelming. I would recommend this to pretty much anyone, though it is obviously better to have watched the original show for context.

  I have also recently finished the internet-famous Balance Arc (aka Season One) of the actual play DnD podcast, **[The Adventure Zone](http://www.maximumfun.org/shows/adventure-zone)** ooooh boy this one blew me away and is pretty much the perfect storm. Firstly, it is hosted and run by the McElroy brothers and their former radio host father, some of the funniest people on the internet. Other well-known projects of theirs are the Polygon YouTube series "Monster Factory" and the comedy advice podcast "My Brother, My Brother, and Me". These guys' style of improv and conversational comedy is just exceptional, and they adapt to the new area of tabletop gaming very very well. Griffin is a stellar DM with great skill in foreshadowing and long-term plot construction, who can also improv voices and conversations and characters on a dime, and also tie a hundred narrative threads up to create heartwarming moments that actually drove me to tears. And while the players take a while to find their footing, all three of the player characters flesh out into fully realized people who I find uniquely compelling. The story definitely isn't rational fiction, Griffin often let's them get away with stuff if it's sufficiently funny or cool, but it's great regardless. Find it in podcast form somewhere, and be careful to start at the actual beginning at "Here They Be Gerblins" and not the recently begun second season. It takes a little bit to get rolling, but when it does they knock it out of the park.

  Any one have game recommendation?


  I liked when Sierra Lee posted her "The Last Sovereign" on this sub. 


  Any other rational games?
  ```

  - u/Wiron:
    ```
    [Choice of Robots](https://www.choiceofgames.com/robots/) and [Choice of Alexandria](https://www.choiceofgames.com/alexandria/). In both you play as brilliant inventor that can change the world. Player choices actually matter and there is many branching paths.
    ```

  - u/Amonwilde:
    ```
    I'm not sure what a rational game looks like, except in a story sense. I'm playing Slay the Spire a lot recently, it's a roguelike card-based strategy/RPG. You're fighting your way up through three worlds and after every fight, you add a card to your deck. If you die, you start again from the beginning.

    If you don't mind playing a classic, Planescape: Torment would probably appeal to many in this sub. Themes of immortality, memory, and transhumanism.
    ```

    - u/ketura:
      ```
      [I actually wrote an essay on this topic] (https://docs.google.com/document/d/11QAh61C8gsL-5KbdIy5zx3IN6bv_E9UkHjwMLVQ7LHg/edit?usp=drivesdk), and when I'm not slacking off, attempting to prove it possible. TL;DR what Mark Brown calls an "Immersive Sim" is very close to what I think a rational game should be, with an additional layer on top that forces you to use deduction even once you've mastered the mechanics, and with a baseline of not making your story/marketing conflict with the gameplay premise.
      ```

    - u/alexanderwales:
      ```
      I'll second Slay the Spire; it's got some great devs working on it, and updates with content/balance on a regular basis (it's in early access). For me it sort of scratches the same itch that Dominion does, though it's (mercifully) single player, which allows a lot of freedom of design that I feel like you don't get as much in multiplayer games.

      The dailies runs are also really great, one of the best in roguelikes that I've played, mostly because of how distinctive the different combinations can feel.
      ```

- u/duffmancd:
  ```
  [Girl Genius](http://www.girlgeniusonline.com/comic.php?date=20021104) - A webcomic set in a steampunk-esque world with Mad! Scientists (and Mad! Science!). About as consistent as a world with Hollywood mad science can be. The artwork is beautiful and absurdly detailed, as is the worldbuilding, and they have been publishing reasonably consistently since 2000. Deals with human augmentation and AI person-hood (albeit several books in). Was my introduction to the wonderful corollary of Clark's 3rd Law: *"Any sufficiently analysed magic is indistinguishable from science"*

  [Schlock Mercenary](https://www.schlockmercenary.com/2000-06-12) - It's been mentioned here before, but its a web comic strip set following the adventures of a space-borne mercenary crew. Despite its comedic form, it deals with some heavy transhumanist topics and is consistent with the disruption each new development brings. When the Scotty-type improves interstellar travel, the whole world reacts; when the team come up with new weapons, their enemies learn and work out ways to counter etc. **And** it's often hilarious.
  ```

  - u/daydev:
    ```
    Fair warning, though, Girl Genius relies very heavily on Plotdemandium. Like "protagonist happens to go to a place for no particular reason, finds out that's exactly where they needed to go, and more", e.g. "go looking in the sewers for a contact, stumble upon the 'King in the mountain'". That's just one example, especially in the second super-arc (but also present before that) it seems the protagonist is just carried through the plot by convenient coincidences. Other flavors of Plotdemandium are also present, like power levels fluctuating according to the needs of the plot.

  Anyone got any good pokemon fanfiction recommendations? (Aside from OoS, of course, which I'm already reading.) It seems like if I try to browse the ff.net section, all I find are stories written by twelve year olds, for twelve year olds, with appropriate levels of edgyness and/or wish fulfilment.

  I'm kind of an anti-fan of the anime nowadays, so if ash ketchum is the main character, and acts like ash ketchum, I'm probably not going to enjoy it. Red is cool though, since he's basically just a thin skin for an OC.

  I also pretty much exclusively read stories with an adventure component; SOL or romance doesn't typically do it for me.

  And to contradict that previous paragraph, I would like to recommend [Olivine Romance](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://archiveofourown.org/works/1609088/chapters/3425729&ved=2ahUKEwj_uf2Cje_aAhXJ3YMKHa23DbkQFjAAegQIBhAB&usg=AOvVaw1RhUiAqKfjeHDQF-54bKZ5) which is a bildungsroman focused on effectively-OCs that wear the skins of various Johto gym leaders. It has excellent tactical pokemon battles, a diverse cast of characters, and stakes high enough to care about, but not so high as to be unbelievable.
  ```

  - u/Makin-:
    ```
    [The Game of Champions](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7354757/1/The-Game-of-Champions) is *kind of* edgy, especially the first chapter, but it's really good, you might like it. I agree finding good Pokemon fics is nigh impossible.

  has anyone read any good story with a competent amoral/evil protagonist? I just read [Blood and Chaos](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/blood-and-chaos-the-story-of-a-btvs-si-turned-vampire.354777/) and look for something with a main character like Jack(preferably less crazy) who uses science and munchkins everything mainly for his own gain and doesn't really value human life beyond the people he actually cares about.
  ```

  - u/Noumero:
    ```
    That's pretty broad.

    * [*The Girl Who Poked God With A Stick*](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:Q1bVpZxBmTQJ:squid314.livejournal.com/336195.html+&cd=3&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=uk) (3k words): the protagonist is competent, immoral, and [slight spoiler](#s " immortal").

    * [*The Giving Plague*](http://www.davidbrin.com/fiction/givingplague.html) (7k) and [*Antihypoxiant*](http://www.galactanet.com/oneoff/antihypoxiant.html) (1k) — short stories featuring sociopathic/megalomaniacal biologists/medicians.

    * [*The Things*](http://clarkesworldmagazine.com/watts_01_10/) (7k) — a fanfiction of John Carpenter's *The Thing*, written from the perspective of the monster.

    * [*Understand*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7234685-understand) (14k) by Ted Chiang; the protagonist undergone an experimental procedure that made him superintelligent, then escaped from the researchers. Passably competent, and cares about certain abstract concepts much more than about humans.

    * [*Timelooping Tinker*](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11239837/1/Timelooping-Tinker) (21k), a *Worm* fanfiction. Bakuda in a time loop. Probably closest to *Blood and Chaos* in atmosphere.

    * [*The Metropolitan Man*](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10360716/1/The-Metropolitan-Man) (81k) — rational villainous protagonist Lex Luthor vs. rational Superman.

    * [*A Prison of Glass*](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-prison-of-glass-worm-cyoa.486424/) (100k), a *Worm* fanfiction. Very unique, as self-inserts go: the self-insert character acts very callously to everyone except canon *Worm* characters she got a liking to; the story is told through perspectives of other people, but never hers. Also fairly close to *Blood and Chaos*.

    * [*Crystal Trilogy*](http://crystal.raelifin.com/), sort of. The protagonist is an artificial intelligence with an utility function orthogonal to human morality. AIs are written competently, i. e. they're sufficiently inhuman. There's three books in the series, the first one is [free](http://crystal.raelifin.com/society/) (200k words).

    * [*Twig*](https://twigserial.wordpress.com/) (1600k words) by Wildbow — the protagonist is a social manipulator, part of a spy/problem-solving group of augmented children in service of a biotechnological Academy. He loves his companions, and tends to disregard lives of everyone else. >!At least at the beginning.!<

    Wuxia-level writing quality, but you might try Warlock of the Magus World. A scientist is reborn into a Western fantasy world and brings along an AI chip that gives him an unfair advantage.

  "Professor Theo Cray is trained to see patterns where others see chaos. So when mutilated bodies found deep in the Montana woods leave the cops searching blindly for clues, Theo sees something they missed. Something unnatural. Something only he can stop.

  As a computational biologist, Theo is more familiar with digital code and microbes than the dark arts of forensic sleuthing. But a field trip to Montana suddenly lands him in the middle of an investigation into the bloody killing of one of his former students. As more details, and bodies, come to light, the local cops determine that the killer is either a grizzly gone rogue…or Theo himself. Racing to stay one step ahead of the police, Theo must use his scientific acumen to uncover the killer. Will he be able to become as cunning as the predator he hunts—before he becomes its prey?"

  The audio book is also very good.

    Ken Macleod, the corporation wars, in which the background setting is that reactionaries and social justice warriors eventually escalated from flame wars to *actual* war until the world got really sick of their shit and put them all on ice, and the actual story is set 3000 years later during the attempt to rehabilitate the frozen dead via community service. At which point the shooting starts again. Way more entertaining than it sounds

    Schooled in Magic by Nuttall is rational-adjacent. It's a girl from the modern world transported to a fantasy setting, and who is horrified by the serfdom and slavery. She is truly limited by how much she remembers, for example she regrets that she doesn't remember programming. It's quite a fun story - like most of Nuttall's writing. It's not finished yet but there are around 12 books so far and Nuttall writes at a mad speed.

    Is Ascend online rational-adjacent (I haven't read it)? If your just looking for fun lit-rpg, with rationality, [this list of audiobooks is decent](https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/106563.LitRPG_audiobooks).

  Enjoying this. Not sure I would call it rational but the main character is very munchkiny and in a unique position to exploit things. The writing quality isn't amazing but the ideas are usually interesting and different. The smut is fairly irregular and irrelevant to the plot so it kind of seems pointless, though it still makes sense in story. And after a poll it largely becomes background noise. 

  Seems like something people here might enjoy.

    Read it last year until they had to depart for dwarf kingdoms. Then dropped and now it has too many chapters to catch up.

    Everybody loves large chests is a great sort of popcorn fic. It doesn't take itself seriously, features smut a few times to varying degrees of intensity (with warning, don't worry), but has a richness of character and world building that's hard to put down.

    Lots of chapters, but they're fairly short and go quite quickly. Would hesitate to call it ~~rationalist~~ rational as well, but it is very much self consistent and features some basic inhuman motivational patterns that, while simple, still surprised and entertained quite often.

    Prose quality is definitely one of it's weaknesses, but this is one of the rare cases where I can say that it doesn't significantly detract from my enjoyment of the story.
