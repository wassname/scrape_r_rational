## [D] Great Time Loop Stories

### Post:

What are your favorite Time Loop stories? It is one of my favorite plot devices, both in original fiction and in fanfiction. The potential for munchkinry and optimization is big. There are many that I have enjoyed, such as Mother of Learning or Edge of Tomorrow, but my favorite remains Groundhog Day. Bill Murray really nails it, and the story is excellent. It's a fun movie and probably one of the best explorations of the idea in popular media. Let's not just restrict ourselves to what's popular though. Hit me with your favs, across media and popularity! Extra points for works in which the main character really explores what can be done with the loop, in a way fitting of r/rational.

    Oh man, I totally forgot about Primer. That one was a real ride. I should give it a second watch, I bet it makes more sense on the second viewing.

    - u/Frommerman:
      ```
      You need to give it a fifth or sixth watch before it all starts to come together. You need to go through each loop yourself, almost, which is part of why Primer is so brilliant.

  There's a couple relatively obscure ones that I wouldn't call *great* but are probably good enough to be a fix for fellow time-loop addicts.

  Right Moments is a Ranma 1/2 time loop fic where Ranma gets cursed to repeat the day until he's perfectly satisfied with how it went.  Ranma being who he is, that means he'll only be satisfied if he can accomplish a bunch of tasks with really high bars like fairly defeat the grandmaster of his fighting style (who is monstrously powerful) and resolve his series-long romantic crisis.  It does a good job exploring the premise in sufficient depth to satisfy my time loop urges, though I'm not a skilled enough reader to judge how good it is apart from that, other than that it didn't repulse me or blow me out of the water.

  Getting the Hang of Thursdays is a Harry Potter time loop fic where Hermione's Time Turner breaks and casts Hogwarts into a day-long time loop.  It's probably not that unknown, but I bet there's still a bunch of people here who haven't heard of it.  Snape is the main character and looper, and the story as a whole trends more to feelings of claustrophobia and low-grade cosmic horror than power fantasy.  It's got some... less than comfortable events in it, but as a time loop story I think it does its premise justice.

  On the more open-ended community side of things there's The Infinite Loops, a collaborative project spanning a lot of fictional universes to create an opening for authors to write small snippets in a flexible time loop universe.  Basically, the world tree computer thing running the multiverse (From Ah My Goddess) takes a ton of damage from an unknown attack, and in a desperate attempt to stabilize things the admins start setting universes to loop, with an Anchor who remembers each loop and other characters close to the anchor looping occasionally.  The universes will have to loop for billions of years or some other 'large enough' timeframe, so with loopers sometimes showing up in other universes or other variants on their universe authors have a lot of flexibility to write whatever catches their fancy.  There's threads and compilations out there if you look.

    I feel the need to add that I don't know of a single well written story that takes place in the The Infinite Loops setting. It's also 99% just short drabbles and not particularly good ones.

    I think the appeal is just the discussion threads themselves, which have a lot of loop munchkinry and general setting discussion.

    Slight spoiler, but if you're interested in Getting the Hang of Thursdays, be warned, >!it turns into a really creepy HermioneXSnape fic!<. The spoiler here is indeed a spoiler, but if you'd want to know about something *now* that might ruin your enjoyment of a fic when you learn about it once you're already invested, then it may be worth revealing. Discussion follows, spoilered. >!If it weren't for that there's a lot I really like about it; it's not your typical time loop fic where the protagonist uses the time loop to become obscenely strong; the fic focuses much more on the hopelessness of the situation, along with some moderate existential horror towards the end. But the creepy romance ruins it for me, and if I had known about that I probably wouldn't have started it (that said, I did finish it, because I was too invested by that point and the writing is pretty good).!<

  * [Time Braid](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644/1/Time-Braid), which has been mentioned below, is fairly well-known within the community, but has some... questionable consent issues. It does actually have the benefit of reaching a coherent ending, though.

  * [Chunin Exam Day](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3929411/1/Chunin-Exam-Day) is another Naruto timeloop. This time with Naruto in the drivers' seat. It has also been commonly cited as having been a big inspiration for Mother of Learning. It has issues, but has a reasonably strong start.

  * [One-Minute Time Machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBkBS4O3yvY) is adorkable, if not deep.

  * [Timelooping Tinker](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/timelooping-tinker-worm-fanfic-au.17681/) is a timeloop crackfic involving Bakuda from Worm.

  * [Hard Reset](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/67362/hard-reset) is a My Little Pony fanfic that sticks Twilight Sparkle into a timeloop as changelings invade Canterlot. It has a [third-party] sequel [Hard Reset 2: Reset Harder](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/145711/hard-reset-2-reset-harder) which involves multiple loopers, but I've never read that one.

  * [— All You Zombies —](https://www.amazon.com/All-You-Zombies-Robert-Heinlein-ebook/dp/B008MOKW22) by Heinlein and the film adaptation [Predestination](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2397535/) >!involve a closed time loop, but not a groundhog day loop.!<

  * [The Tatami Galaxy](https://myanimelist.net/anime/7785/Yojouhan_Shinwa_Taikei) explores a time loop over the course of the protagonists' schooling.

  * [Magestic](https://storiesonline.net/s/63138/magestic) involves a time loop of sorts with a big-picture how-to-save-the-world scale plot.

  * [Moon](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1182345/) >!feels like a time loop!< .

  * [Butterfly Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Butterfly_Effect) has a time-loop-like effect where the protagonist gets to go back and do-over things from his writings, and was shot with 4 different endings, so you can almost choose how it ends, Worm-style, for good or bad.

  * [Deja Vu Ascendancy](https://storiesonline.net/s/57098/deja-vu-ascendancy?ind=1) is porn but has a sort of side-ways time-loop like effect going on, including several do-over opportunities. It has a rational-seeming or at least mathematically-inclined protagonist, who spends a lot of time in advance planning his heists and trickery, mostly visible to the audience. That said, milder versions of most of the squick issues from Time Braid also exist in this story, and it completely fails at having a decent ending. Oh, and it is absolutely massive.

    Hard Reset is phenomenal.

Plus, there are two complete sequels which aren't time loops, but involve time travel.

    Hard Reset 2 is a fork by a different author, and it's fun rationality-porn, but sadly incomplete.

    Re: Deja Vu Ascendancy

    The preamble in which the author happily admits that his story is 3.5 million words and it takes almost 60k for something plot-relevant to actually happen, alongside a dozen "unique" grammar conventions is extremely scary. This guy does not know how to sell his story at all lol, it could not have put me off of reading it any more.
    ```

    - u/greenskye:
      ```
      As someone who made it through all 3.5 million words, there is a decent story in there, but it is in serious need of editing. The crazy girlfriend is extremely cringe inducing for the first 3rd at least. And the middle section moves incredibly slowly until the author suddenly decides to end it and accelerates the plot 1000%. Ultimately I'd say I enjoyed it, but it took me 3 attempts to get into it and I had to brute force my way through several sections. If the concept doesn't super intrigue you and you aren't desperate for something to read, it's probably not worth the effort.
      ```

        ```
        Thanks for the review! I'll admit it does sound interesting, but if you're telling me I have to power through a million words before it starts to get good I'm gonna have to pass. I'll check it out if I'm ever in a time loop myself, lol.

    Wouldndefinitely recommend Hard Reset and Hard Reset 2: Reset Harder.

    Steins:Gate also has elements of a time loop in the midpoint, though it's more about time travel in general.

  Source Code is a movie about a man who loops a few minutes on a train and is tasked with solving the mystery of why it explodes.

  The First Fifteen Lives of Harry August is a thriller novel about a man who is brought back to the time of his birth whenever he dies.

  The Netflix miniseries Russian Doll fits this, too. 

  There's also the Stargate SG-1 Episode "Window of Opportunity", though that is probably only so excellent because of the character humour - nothing Rational to write home about.

  [Replay](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/341735.Replay) by Ken Grimwood - what if you die at 43 and wake up in your 18-year-old body with your memories intact.

  [The End of Eternity](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/509784.The_End_of_Eternity) by Isaac Asimov. The Eternity is an organization that trades between the various centuries to reduce human suffering. They also have to guarantee their own creation. A technician within the organization falls in love and learns that in the new reality planned for his time, his loved one will not exist.

  Ted Chiang's [The Story of Your Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Story_of_Your_Life) (the Arrival movie) and [The Merchant and the Alchemists Gate](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/223379.The_Merchant_and_the_Alchemist_s_Gate) are both amazing.

  Since you liked Edge of Tomorrow, check out the [manga](https://myanimelist.net/manga/62887/All_You_Need_Is_Kill?q=al%20you%20need%20is%20kill) or the [novel](https://myanimelist.net/manga/18511/All_You_Need_Is_Kill). The manga is better than the movie and I enjoyed the latter.

  I was way too young when I read [The Man Who Folded Himself](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/624122.The_Man_Who_Folded_Himself) by David Gerrold and was not prepared for the (sexual) plot. It was too long ago for me to remember if this is a valid recommendation ;)

  Non-fiction: [The Order of Time](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36442813-the-order-of-time) by Carlo Rovelli is a short, physics/philosophy book that explores the meaning of time. I highly recommend it.

  Media: [Dark](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5753856) series, [Los cronocrímenes](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0480669/) (should be more known), [About Time](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2194499/) (a light, feel-good movie based on [About Time: 12 Short Stories](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/72695.About_Time) about time travel).

    I also was rather young when I read The Man Who Folded Himself and I thought it was fantastic (at the time).

  I'm not sure whether you'd count it as a *loop*, exactly, but The Many Deaths of Harry Potter has him resetting to an earlier point each time he dies. Which is often, because apart from his reset ability, he doesn't wear any plot armour. Run down the wrong street when being chased by Dudley? >!Death Eaters take him to Quirrelmort and he gets stabbed.!< Walk down the Hogwarts Express alone? >!He gets shoved onto the track and crushed.!< Fight the troll on Halloween? >!This one's easy to guess.!<

  And the reset point keeps jumping forward, without him having any control over it nor identifying a pattern >!except that there's a good chance that it will be too late to prevent tragedies other than his own death!<.

  All in all, I found it quite a good take on, "what would it really be like to be the Chosen One?" (hint: there is a substantial bounty on his head)

  State the obvious technique: Time Braid would be on many lists including mine.  Purple Days is another fic that aspires to greatness and definitely touches it, but it's still running so we don't know if it will nail the ending.

  Harry Potter and the Temporal Beacon is deadfic and probably not everyone's cuppa, but I liked it while it lasted.  HP&t Wastelands of Time, likewise not everyone's cuppa, likewise I happened to enjoy it.

    I remain astonished that anyone is able to read Purple Days, much less enjoy it. I can understand why people are divided over Time Braid - it has great qualities as well as some very questionable content. And Wastelands of Time as you say is a matter of preference.

    But Purple Days is so badly written it causes my eyes to bleed out of my skull. I sincerely do not get it.
    ```

    - u/GlimmervoidG:
      ```
      I had to agree on Purple Days. Really didn't enjoy it and gave up. 

      I think part of the problem is that it started in medias res. We are introduced to a Joffrey who's already nice. He likes everyone the audience likes, hates (almost) everyone the audience wants him him to hate. I think that was a massive mistake for a Time Loop story. Time loops are about the development of a character - skills, yes, but more importantly emotion. By jumping straight into the end point, it skipped the point of the timeloop. 

      And yes, it then jumped back and started showing stuff in order but by them it was too late for me. 

      This ties into the "likes everyone the audience likes" bit I mentioned. It just leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Maybe if we saw him get there step by step, it would be different, but by opening with that end state it lost me. It just tasted too damn saccharine.
      ```

      - u/sfinebyme:
        ```
        The author has since said that opening is non-canon as it cannot align with where the story went. I'm not sure why he hasn't deleted it, though. The story got quite a bit better and somewhere in the middle started to get *really* good.
        ```

        - u/JackStargazer:
          ```
          I'd agree. It had a weak beginning, but then it went to areas canon never explored and got great. Good world building, mounting threats, the writing improved.

          I think the starting blurb should be rewritten and become 1/10 the size, just a quick blurb about Joffrey acting ooc.
          ```

      - u/Sophronius:
        ```
        Starting in medias res is fine. Giving the reader a preview of what is to come is important in fanfiction especially, since the audience doesn't have a lot of patience. You can see it as a pilot episode if you like. I'm even fine with the blatant wish fulfilment and power fantasies. It's not like I'm trying to be a snob.

        But you're right that the story affirms everything the author believes, and that is just bad writing. There's a whole segment where he riffs on Catelyn Stark and then all the characters go "hahaha that is so true she does suck". Ugh. It's not just annoying, it means that his characters don't have any life or experiences of their own.

        But what gets me the most is that he obviously hasn't read his own writing even once. One read-through is all it would take to fix 95% of the spelling and grammar errors, and he can't even be bothered  to do that. That kind of disrespect towards one's own story... I cannot comprehend it.

          > One read-through is all it would take to fix 95% of the spelling and grammar errors

          It is common to not see errors in your own writing, no matter how many times you read it.
          ```

          - u/GlimmervoidG:
            ```
            Useful tip for that: most word processes come with a text to speech function. Use it to read back what you've written. Mistakes that your eyes will skim over, will stand out to your ears.
            ```

    - u/Hidden-50:
      ```
      Hmm, I like Purple Days a lot. You don't like the pacing?

      (Many have said that some arcs have been a bit long, especially the Yi-Ti one.)

      There's also the problem of >!the decision leading to the final arc being a bit stupid, with Jofrey taking a big risk on something rather than come back in another loop!<
      ```

    - u/LiminalSouthpaw:
      ```
      If you skip over Joffery's speeches and read it with the effects his meddling has on the wider world in mind I think it's pretty good. And in truth, Purple Days nails the painful and hypocritical process of becoming a better person in a way that few things I've ever read could. You don't go from a gleeful torturer to the promised savior without a *lot* of back and forth in between.

      Personally, I found the >!final message of the Deep Ones!< deeply moving on an existential level.

  'ALL YOU NEED IS KILL'

  Either the original light novel by Hiroshi Sakurazaka or the (very faithful) manga adaptation by Ryosuke Takeuchi. Since you liked Edge of Tomorrrow, you should also be able to enjoy its source material. Personally, I liked the manga the most out of the three. 

  'Source Code' 

  A movie from 2011 by Duncan Jones. It's not your usual time loop story but nevertheless really good. Though if I think too much on it, the ending gives me headache...fucking time travel.

  I'm surprised no one brought up [Happy Death Day](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/happy_death_day). It's a horror comedy that was popular enough to earn a sequel (with a third installment in development). The characters are genre-savvy enough to make it entertaining and the whole thing is about fun rather than a serious exploration of time loops or philosophy.

  - u/SeekingImmortality:

    The -expression- of the main character in the second movie, during the first loop of the movie, was pretty much my highlight from the film.

    >!Imagine going through the movie Groundhog Day, becoming a better person, making friends with everyone you met in the loop, escaping the time loop, having several weeks or months of life, and then suddenly ENDING UP BACK AT THE START OF THE LOOP AGAIN.

  MLP:FIM time 

  [The Best Night Ever by Capn_Chryssalid](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/18087/the-best-night-ever) is really good. The standout element is the emotional and narrative arc. Through the intersession of a time loop Prince Blueblood, a snobbish manchild in the series, must grow up and become a man (well stallion ;). Very well written and in the style of the original Groundhog Day in that the primary journey is emotional rather than grinding skills.

        Try [_Hard Reset 2: Reset Harder_](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/145711/hard-reset-2-reset-harder). It's a fork of the story by a different author that is even better than the original _Hard Reset_ (let alone its lackluster sequels).

          Tried it and I agree it was very good. Too bad it was abandoned before it could really get to the meat of the story.

      Don't get me started on that series.

      First there's the totally unheroic protagonist, with a sense of empathy so local that it borders on object impermanence; committing shocking acts and not suffering any lasting guilt or consequences, let alone making any attempt to atone or make amends.

      Then there's the twist, with no (or all the wrong kind of) foreshadowing, that the whole first story was actually >!an elaborately framed coming-out story!<; and an almost comically generic one, seemingly >!imported wholesale from the real world without regard for pony society!<.

      Then there's the entire first two thirds of the trilogy being >!part of a predestination loop!<, which the characters >!deliberately adhere to!<; and the rest of the story revolving around the >!predestined events'!< consequences. Related to that is the incoherent metaphysics; seeming to employ the *X-Files* technique of "if you repeat something enough, people will believe it makes sense". How did Celly know that >!her particular timeline!< was the one that >!Star Swirl would be summoned to!<? What does it mean to >!"tie off" timelines!<? Why do >!the Regalia split timelines!<? What did/do the apparent ultimate antagonists, >!the forces of Time and Destiny!<, actually want? Did they achieve it, and if not, why not?

      Then there's the dropped plot threads. What happens to >!the untransformed changelings!<? Why couldn't >!Star Swirl perfect the loop spell!<? What are >!the secrets Luna won't tell!<? Who >!altered Star Swirl's letter!<, how, and why?

      For a huge plot hole (or plot-induced stupidity), why didn't >!the trapped Twilight!< just >!follow the "Perfect Run" and *not* use the Regalia!<? And later on, if she >!was always planning to betray her other self!<, why did >!the spell she gave her!< ultimately >!work perfectly!<?

      At the end, why (besides more object impermanence) doesn't >!Star Swirl jump further into the future!<, in order to >!be with both of his wives!<? What will happen to >!Shooting Star's timeline!<, especially given the previously stated consequences of >!altering established history!<?

      Glad other people enjoyed it, at least. It was certainly a page-turner in parts.

      Also, "the changelings win and kill everyone in Canterlot" is false or misleading in a number of ways.

  Deponia Doomsday remains to this day the one piece of media with the most complex yet ultimately consistent time-travel shenanigans, featuring three different timetravel methods, one of them the good'ol time "reset time to a particular point while specific subjects keep their memories".

      I mean, you gotta play the trilogy before doomsday to truly appreciate it though. My favourite point and click adventure series by a mile, as long as you're not too oversensitive for german humor.

  [https://store.steampowered.com/app/822830/Ouroboros/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/822830/Ouroboros/)  


  it is a porn game RPG game when you repeat the very short story again and again uncovering new stuff and getting different endings.  


  Very good imho. You will need to download a porn patch since steam does not allow porn content.

    Reminds me of long live the queen. Game in which you control a young monarch, and try to keep her and her country alive. It was a lot of fun to slowly uncover all the hidden plots and motives on subsequent playthroughs.

    If we're talking visual novels with that sort of mechanic, I'm currently playing the Zero Escape series, and it does so much with that. It isn't time loop as much as >!the protagonist living through parallel universes but being able to share information with himself across them.!< But the end result is pretty similar.

  Not a time loop but a do-over litrpg story.

  PMMM is hands down the best time loop story I've ever seen, by a logn shot. I like Mother of Learning and The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya as well, but they don't really compare imo.

  Random shoutout to [12:01](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106188/). It's not an especially good time loop story or anything, it's just literally the first time loop story I watched as a kid so back then it blew my mind even if in hindsight it's probably terrible XD.

  I don't know if it properly qualifies as a time loop, though it has many of its characteristic, but the Doctor Who episode [Heaven Sent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven_Sent_%28Doctor_Who%29) is great, achieving the impressive feat of giving you temporal vertigo with a story that literally spans billions of years, something rather unusual in mainstream fiction. Too bad it was the first half of a two parter that had a rather disappointing ending...

  Ghost Trick. The only game I can think of that really captures the feeling of "time loop learning".
