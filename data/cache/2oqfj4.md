  The first two words from Wikipedia's article on smallpox:

  > Smallpox was
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Smallpox was no god; it was but one face of the Demon with a Million, Billion Maws. The Great Devourer, whose appetite for the children of Life will never be sated. Whose terrible hunger leads men to sacrifice one another to the Great Beast, that they might momentarily slow its advance.

    Smallpox was but a mere shadow of the Gaping Void from which none can ever return. The Cold Dark of Oblivion were all Life ends. The Endless Abyss that would engulf reality itself if left unchecked.

    Smallpox was but another name for Death, the True Enemy, whose mere mention drives men to sew their own eyes shut, that they might not meet its maddening gaze.

    ...But Smallpox was.

    And one face at a time, we will strike Death down. We will not ever rest until the True Enemy is defeated. Until all of reality is safe from its grasp, and all that is left of its legacy is a sad memory of what could have been.

    In time, even Death may die.

  Inspirational. I wish we had more of these stories to tell. I'd support any reasonable government that promised to kill another of these gods.

      >On March 27, 2014, the WHO announced the eradication of poliomyelitis in the South-East Asia Region, in which the WHO includes eleven countries: [Bangladesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh), [Bhutan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhutan), [North Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea), [India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India), [Indonesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia), [Maldives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maldives), [Myanmar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myanmar), [Nepal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal), [Sri Lanka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka), [Thailand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand) and [Timor-Leste](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timor-Leste).  With the addition of this region, the proportion of world population living in polio-free regions has reached 80%.  The last case of wild polio in the South-East Asia Region was reported in India on 13 January 2011. 

      >Up to October 15, 243 cases of wild polio have been reported - compared to 293 in the same period last year, a 17% improvement. In the 3 endemic countries, Nigeria has reduced polio cases greatly from 49 to 6, Afghanistan increased to 12 from 7 and Pakistan greatly increased to 206 from 43. 19 cases have also been reported this year in non-endemic countries.  The number of polio cases reported in Pakistan reached a 14-year high of 206. The outbreak has been blamed on Al Qaeda and Taliban militants, who prevent aid workers from vaccinating children in rural regions of the country.

  In young children, the choking scourges of diphtheria and Hemophilis influenzae B (HiB) epiglottis are practically gone.

  I don't think of these diseases as "ancient mad gods" so much as "spirits, spectres and ghosts" that haunt and cling to our bodies, feeding on our life.

  And we're not stopping there.

- u/MolokoPlusPlus:
  ```
  We've also eradicated [rinderpest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rinderpest), which killed livestock rather than people.

  It's a likely candidate for the fifth of the Ten Plagues, *dever* or "cattle disease".

  As of 2011 it no longer exists.
