## [D][BST] What would be worth killing a baby for?

### Post:

Let's say that there's a very specific type of magic that requires the sacrifice of a healthy baby of at least six pounds. This magic has been extensively studied, and its limits have been mapped out by an evil empire whose scientific methods were strong but whose infrastructure and ability to withstand invasions was not. We know that the baby-killing magic works. We know how it works. We know that it can't be short-circuited in all of the obvious (or even non-obvious) ways that you might immediately think about trying.

If you kill a baby with this ritual, *X* happens.

* **What is the lower bound at which you think this cost would be acceptable?**

And if you think there is no lower bound, I'd like to know that too.

(This is for a story.)

  Preventing loss of life is pretty much the major metric I'd judge its worth by.

  There is a short story called "The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas" where it's heavily implied that one child being neglected and mistreated its whole life leads to a perfect utopia for everyone else.  Everyone at some point in their life is shown the child and made to understand its suffering once, and then can ignore it/live with the knowledge. Some tiny minority of people end up leaving, unable to bear living there anymore knowing what the cost is.

  I have mixed feelings about Omelas. I think the mistreatment and neglect of the child is hard to stomach for the intended purpose of "make everything perfect" since the lack of suffering/death isn't really singled out: most forms of utopia I imagine though has mostly conquered these things. At the same time, our society is far less perfect than Omelas, has far more horrible fates done to far more people in it, and most people are pretty okay with the status quo.

  Compared to both these things, sacrificing the life of a newborn infant to improve society isn't so strange. If I cared that much about keeping babies alive, I would give most of my money to natal care facilities in third world countries.

  So if the baby's sacrifice is done to achieve a true utopia, I have to admit that that's acceptable to me.  If it requires multiple babies, even. How many is a good question that I have no ready answer for: for now all I can say is my System 1 is uneasy with more than one per year.

  But if the spell does something more practical/realistic like save the country from imminent slaughter/destruction, that too is acceptable, since the loss of life is clearly weighted. Let's say you could sacrifice a baby to power a weapon that would help you win a single battle. In such a case, using it for self-defense is perfectly acceptable, since much more life would be lost, and much more suffering spread, by being slaughtered... including the child's own anyway.

  Much farther down the totem pole, individual improvements are harder to accept. Sacrificing a baby to restore someone's health and youth, for example, is rather ghoulish, and has the potential to be seriously abused even if intended to be done with good intentions. Again, I can't come up with an exact number at the moment, but my System 1 is most uncomfortable with less than 10 lives saved for one baby, and less uncomfortable with every factor of ten increased after that. A baby for a hundred lives seems necessary, to me.

  In addition, selection is something that should be addressed as well. To make it the most acceptable, no one should have their children taken from them against their will. There should be a pool of well compensated women who are okay with basically providing a steady supply of babies for possible use. These children would be well treated and raised communally until they pass the age where it's no longer possible to use them for the spell, and then given to foster programs. Youngest babies would be prioritized if one needed to be picked at any given time.

  Looking forward to seeing the story that spawned this :)

    The story opens with two dark wizards about to sacrifice a baby in a dark ritual. They end up raising him as their own instead, because they can't bring themselves to do it. The boy is then the protagonist of the story.

    I've been toying with when he'll learn about the ritual he was destined for, and what the ultimate goal of it would have been. His parents are meant to be morally ambiguous but mostly sympathetic, which means that there needs to be a fairly sound logic to their decision-making - something that you could argue might actually be "right", or at least something that sympathetic characters could have agreed was "right" before being presented with the reality of actually having blood on their hands.
    ```

    - u/DaystarEld:
      ```
      If they don't end up doing the ritual, they must suffer somehow as a result, no?  Also, is he their child? 

      Without knowing more about the story it's hard to throw out specifics, but what if it was to cleanse themselves of some curse or illness? The problem obviously is that they'll still be suffering for it if they don't do a sacrifice, but it's a kind of selfish-yet-understandable sort of goal.
      ```

      - u/alexanderwales:
        ```
        He's not their child, they stole him from an orphanage.

        A lot of these comments are about the prevention of some bad thing happening, but right now I'm thinking that the ritual was intended for some positive measure - some enhancement of some kind. Perhaps the ritual would prevent their deaths by anything short of decapitation, and they reasoned that the life of an infant was worth less than potentially centuries of continued youth.

        The big thing I'm worried about is that the boon they hoped to gain can't be *too* good, because otherwise the reader will be left scratching their head about why *everyone* doesn't try to kill babies all the time. But it also can't be *too* bad, because otherwise the dark wizards become irredeemable for having decided to kill a baby for such a small benefit. I don't know - it's not hugely important to the plot, but it is something I'd like to decide on.
        ```

        - u/DaystarEld:
          ```
          So the ritual is widely known among society? Yeah, that makes the immortality boon way too powerful. The reason people are intent on preventing bad things rather than granting boons is that justifying murder tends to require preventing greater suffering: selfish murder is pretty immoral by most standards. That said, they ultimately don't go through with it, so that certainly helps. 

          Assuming they're a couple, what if she's barren and it would allow her to conceive their own child?
          ```

          - u/alexanderwales:
            ```
            Oh, they're both men. So that won't work.

            The plan is for dark magic to (for the most part) have a lot of things that are moral but also icky - it's shunned because it's equivalent to a socially unacceptable answer to the trolley problem, or the utilitarian transplant surgeon. Killing one person to save two others *makes sense*, and it also makes sense that a kingdom which considers itself "good" would not do it. And the story is sort of about the difference between good and evil, especially when considering the corner cases of morality.

            So I guess what I'm shooting for is morally defensible, mildly selfish, and somewhat unpleasant to System 1.

    It was pretty explicitly stated, it just wasn't explained why that was the case. It's short, well-written, and I highly recommend it. It can be found online if you look in the right places (google).
    ```

    - u/DaystarEld:
      ```
      Yeah, that's what I mean: we know the child is suffering, but we don't know WHY. It's just implied that it's "necessary," or at least, that the reader must think it's necessary to accept the whole idea of the utopia's existence. It's a very uniquely written story, and definitely recommended to anyone that hasn't read it
      ```

- u/trifith:
  ```
  A baby, already born, is a human life, though perhaps not a sentient one. It has a functional brain, so qualifies for my definition of person-hood. This means killing it is reserved for lifeboat type situations (in my morality). 

  So it would need to be a situation where killing the baby would prevent a clear, assured, immediate danger to at least 2 other people that cannot be prevented in any other way. The danger and necessity would need to be as certain as the success of the ritual. 

  This is the very very lowest bound. The level of certainty I'd need to actually perform the ritual is unlikely to exist in real life though.

  Hmm.

  Well. Lets say we assume babies have 0 value as sapient beings. They would still have the value of being 9 months of work to produce. Maybe a bit less if we learn to mass produce them in the future.

  Point is, sacrificing them for truly trivial things is definitely out. If it takes less than nine months of work by one person you probably don't want to waste a perfectly good baby on it.

  Now realistically, I'm not exactly sure what I would put as the intrinsic value of a six pound baby, but it almost assuredly isn't zero.

  I'd say its probably lower than the value of a more developed mind, so sacrificing them for immortality might be acceptable. How much utility a human life is worth in the first place is a somewhat open question, but we've already managed to get some economic estimates of it http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_of_life.

  But there's another layer, Some societies just can't handle sacrificing babies. Our current society would certainly be outraged at almost any baby sacrifice, so even if it was one baby a week for the immortality of the rest of humanity, (definitely worth while) I think we'd still have to ease it into the culture.

    Maybe if you amortize it out? Save a million people five minutes of work?
    ```

    - u/DaystarEld:
      ```
      Meh. I'd consider 5 minutes of work a rounding error. Unless I'm on the way to the hospital or something, five minutes is rarely enough time to do anything so important that I would care about recouping or losing it.
      ```

      - u/TimTravel:
        ```
        A brief moment of joy should be considered nonzero, at least. There are ways of making it work for most utility-distribution functions.

        edit: if it's a million people then we would expect some of them to get saved five important minutes...maybe.
        ```

  - u/Terkala:
    ```
    With your last example. I think if it is anything that can be classified as a "common good" where not everyone needs to be aware of the baby-sacrificing magic, then it would likely be implemented by the nobility in secret.

    There would also be the "other person's baby" argument. You would value your own offsrping much more highly than someone else's.
    ```

    - u/Timewinders:
      ```
      This exact situation comes up in a Harry Potter fanfic I've read, where the nobility sacrifices a child every seven years to make the country more secure. Every character who learns about it considers it to be evil, including the main antagonist. Keeping it a secret made it more evil than it needed to be since a consenting volunteer couldn't be used. Instead it was done by lottery.
      ```

    ```
    >If it takes less than nine months of work by one person you probably don't want to waste a perfectly good baby on it.

    I mean at some point we're going to be refining production of babies for this ritual, either artificial wombs, inciting twins or octoplets etc.

    Obviously there's a point where the value of the material and energy going into producing the child is less than the value of the ritual, but up til then there are efficiencies to be made.

    More seriously, there are *two* pretty much separate questions embedded here - "what would be worth purposefully killing a person for" (I think I'm a utilitarian consequentialist here) and "what are babies worth, morally?" (for which my bounds are "neither less than a half, nor more than double of a 50 year old human, and *definitely less* than a 1-14 year old human - I intuitively feel plotting "intrinsic moral weight" with "age" gives a curve which peaks somewhere in early childhood, assuming life spans of 80-120. )

     I encourage thinking about how your answer would practically translate to the real world which does not have morally inconvenient magical spells; I'm immediately reminded of the Utilitarian Transplant Surgeon.
    ```

- u/narfanator:
  ```
  A thing I find relevant and interesting is that I've read about certain cultures (some/all of which are fictional... :P) in which infants weren't given a name - or considered truly a person - until their first birthday, since infants under a year died often, but infants over a year died rarely.
  ```

  - u/Newfur:
    ```
    The same is true in many other cultures of babies below 3 months/one season/100 days, and I would generally agree. Babies just plain aren't sapient before 1 total year of life, and anyone who's been around babies that young would know that.
    ```

- u/None:
  ```
  Hmm. Having read your comments about how the ritual is used, I'm having trouble coming up with something that would both be uncommon and morally defensible to most people. If 1% of people are willing to do it, all the babies will die (or society will get restructured around protecting babies) unless there is some limiting factor. Also will this be the only magic ritual possible, or are there others? That might affect it too.
  ```

- u/Charlie___:
  ```
  I think there is an additional problem with the societal impacts of unethical sourcing of babies. I don't want to live in the kind of society where people will be trying to steal babies to get X - in order to be okay, X must outweigh the problems it brings to society.

  If baby-murder that involves *additional* crimes (child abuse, kidnapping, breach of contract) can be controlled somehow (ethically sourced babies only) then X doesn't have to be too big - saving the lives of two babies, or sufficiently large amounts of natural resources (say, enough so that society can afford to train an extra doctor) or something.

  But probably, dark magic will have a negative impact on broader society, and that raises the standards on X a lot. I'd prefer a factor of five at least, possibly more.

  To put a different spin on this, imagine two babies were dying and you were babysitting someone else's baby. By refraining from doing the ritual, you perform a different sort of ritual - you sacrifice a baby so that a society can exist where people can hire babysitters.
  ```

- u/drageuth2:
  ```
  Lowest bound?  Saving the lives of two babies who otherwise _would_ die.  Preferably more.  

  I _might_ accept saving the life of one person old enough to reach sentience, since a baby isn't there yet and therefore less valuable.  

  Of course, that's presuming I can act as a complete utilitarian, and not get caught up in the squishy human feelings of it all.  Realistically, I ain't gonna be killin' any babies.  Not for anything less than preventing something on the order of _thousands_ of deaths or more, anyway.

  That bound is lowered _significantly_ if I can mass-produce guaranteed not-ever-gonna-be-sentient babies with cloning technology and still have it work.  Then the reward just has to be greater than the money required to make one clone.  _That_ kinda system I might actually be able to get in on in real life, too.  It's basically just creepier stem cell harvesting.
  ```

- u/Traiden04:
  ```
  Another late to the party suggestion. The Ritual should be used to open a two way portal to a location and keep it open for some period of time. It would be more a question of what could be done with logistics type of effect rather than a direct life extending or saving effect.
  ```

- u/TimTravel:
  ```
  Munchkining ethics: if Simurgh hands you series of babies that genuinely will cause massive global harm if you don't kill them then you can ethically kill each one as they come. You'd also be ethically obligated to make her stop but still.

  At some point you'd think some sort of minimally unethical baby facsimile would be sufficient, but if it has to be similar enough then the ethical cost would be nearly as bad.
  ```

  - u/PeridexisErrant:
    ```
    > Simurgh hands you series of babies that genuinely will cause massive global harm if you don't kill them then you can ethically kill each one as they come.

    She wants you to get comfortable with killing, and it worked.  You now have a much harder time refusing to kill based on ethical arguments.
    ```

- u/Pluvialis:
  ```
  Personally, I'd say the only moral consideration of any significance here is the question of whose baby it is and what they think. I consider a baby as property, something that has been worked for and would take time, effort and resources to replace, and may well have become sentimentally important to someone and become irreplaceable as far as they're concerned.

  That is, assuming the baby's demise doesn't include discomfort. Torturing babies is a different matter.

  But grieving parents and torture aside, the practical consideration would simply be whether the expected utility of the spell's outcome is higher for you than having a baby.
  ```
