## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  Someone asked for recommendations over on the PGTE subreddit earlier today and I lost track of time and accidentally wrote 1000 words on a response,[ here's a link to the comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/PracticalGuideToEvil/comments/m7a3jl/web_novels_of_similar_quality_to_guide_but/grc5gbp/) since its got brief descriptions of 9 different works I think reasonably worthwhile, even if they've generally cropped up in past recommendation threads over the months (and I think I did a similar response in one of these threads a few months back but couldn't find it when I looked the other week since I hate using Reddit search. I need to start saving these comments so I don't rewrite them from scratch every few months)

  I'm looking for recommendations primarily exploring large scale trans-singularity superintelligent AI interacting with humanity (and not just in a "kill all humans" fashion).

  Good examples of relevant titles I've already read:

  - "The World As It Appears To Be" by Benedict_SC

  - "Branches on the tree of time", "The last christmas" and "A bluer shade of white" by alexanderwales

  - "Friendship is Optimal" by Iceman

  - "The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect" by Roger Williams

  Any suggestions?

    [Transcendent Humanity](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9271192/1/Transcendent-Humanity) is great at this, a lot of transhumanism, uploaded minds, and AI themes. It's a mass effect fic with the tagline of :

    > Humanity never developed FTL. The Prothean archives contained no technology, no Element Zero, just a warning. Isolated from the rest of the galaxy for two thousand years, restricted to their only system, how will humanity have changed when they first meet the Turians? AU, alternate history of humanity and First Contact.

    Another one along the same vein is [Mass Effect/Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/mass-effect-sid-meiers-alpha-centauri.221597/) story. It veers close to crackfic territory because, as the author puts it, he's not giving "due consideration to both fandoms". It's good HFY/transhumanism porn nonetheless.

  Is there another story that slams home the themes of "The Cold Equations" by Tom Godwin without it being a case of disastrously bad engineering and safety protocols? Specifically, that Nature is utterly indifferent to such concerns as morality, justice, fairness, etc., and instead follows strict mathematical laws of cause and effect with no exceptions; that humans create civilization to protect themselves  from Nature's indifference, but outside those protections Nature can and will kill indiscriminately; and that even the most sympathetic of people can end up dying tragically for no good reason?

  The other good example I can give is from HPMOR chapter 39.

  >"All right," Harry said coldly. "I'll answer your original question, then. You asked why Dark Wizards are afraid of death. Pretend, Headmaster, that you really believed in souls. Pretend that anyone could verify the existence of souls at any time, pretend that nobody cried at funerals because they knew their loved ones were still alive. Now can you imagine destroying a soul? Ripping it to shreds so that nothing remains to go on its next great adventure? Can you imagine what a terrible thing that would be, the worst crime that had ever been committed in the history of the universe, which you would do anything to prevent from happening even once? Because that's what Death really is - the annihilation of a soul!"
  >
  >The old wizard was staring at him, a sad look in his eyes. "I suppose I do understand now," he said quietly.
  >
  >"Oh?" said Harry. "Understand what?"
  >
  >"Voldemort," said the old wizard. "I understand him now at last. Because to believe that the world is truly like that, you must believe there is no justice in it, that it is woven of darkness at its core. I asked you why he became a monster, and you could give no reason. And if I could ask him, I suppose, his answer would be: Why not?"
  >
  >They stood there gazing into each other's eyes, the old wizard in his robes, and the young boy with the lightning-bolt scar on his forehead.
  >
  >"Tell me, Harry," said the old wizard, "will you become a monster?"
  >
  > "No," said the boy, an iron certainty in his voice.
  >
  >"Why not?" said the old wizard.
  >
  >The young boy stood very straight, his chin raised high and proud, and said: "There is no justice in the laws of Nature, Headmaster, no term for fairness in the equations of motion. The universe is neither evil, nor good, it simply does not care. The stars don't care, or the Sun, or the sky. But they don't have to! We care! There is light in the world, and it is us! "
  >
  >"I wonder what will become of you, Harry," said the old wizard. His voice was soft, with a strange wonder and regret in it. "It is enough to make me wish to live just to see it."
  >
  >The boy bowed to him with heavy irony, and departed; and the oaken door slammed shut behind him with a thud.

    For books that acknowledge that "Nature is utterly indifferent to such concerns as morality, justice, fairness, etc., and instead follows strict mathematical laws of cause and effect with no exceptions; that humans create civilization to protect themselves from Nature's indifference," I would reccomend the Hogfather; it's not my favorite discworld book, but it is a decent place to start and that's basically it's entire focus. >!Death!< in particular ends up commenting on this very topic directly, but it's a running theme for pretty much the entire story despite the fantastical backstop.

    You might like [17776: What Football will look like in the future](https://www.sbnation.com/a/17776-football). Discovering what the story is about is part of the mystery and the charm, but here's some spoilers as to why it could be relevant: >!Tl;DR is that for some reason people don't get hurt or die anymore, but they also can't reproduce. The year is 17776, and people have basically given up on trying to solve that mystery. Or even solving *other* mysteries.

  I'm looking for two kinds of recs:

  I. **Popcorn-y base-building stories where the main character has almost complete control over their environment**. 

  The best bet is, obviously, Dungeon Core stories, but I feel like I've read all the good ones. Something like a god creating a world/part of a world would also be great. What I'm *not* looking for is a normal human building a base. That's *not* "almost complete control over their environment."

  Some things I've read: *A Lonely Dungeon* (pretty nice), *Post Human* (was ok, but I dropped it after the introduction of the android characters or something similar), *Blue Core* (sorry, explicit sexual content bores me, and so far only the Erogamer was an exception), *Dungeon I/O* (couldn't get past the first few chapters due to bad prose), *Dungeon Heart* (I remember literally nothing about it, but I found it ok while reading), *The Breath of Creation* (liked it), *Obsidian Core* (alright so far, though lacks interesting ideas).

  II. **A non-human/human romance with intelligent characters**. 

  The non-human character must be *distinctly* non-human, especially physically. Basically, if they are humanoid, it's not what I'm looking for. And the human character should be intelligent (and it would be nice, but optional, if the non-human character was like that too). The more rational the story is, the better—but at this point I'm not picky because I've never found even one example of what I'm looking for here.  

  Thanks in advance!

    The two Dungeon Core stories I've most enjoyed are "No Epic Loot Here, Only Puns" and "I Woke Up As A Dungeon, Now What" (the second one is nominally Worm related, in that it's a Tayler Hebert isekai of sorts), neither of which you've mentioned, so I don't know if you've read those two.
    ```

    - u/NTaya:
      ```
      Checked out the first two chapters of "No Epic Loot Here, Only Puns." I don't like the prose so far, but the story itself seems somewhat interesting. I'll check it out in full a bit later, thank you!

      As for "I Woke Up As A Dungeon, Now What," well, I haven't read Worm. Would it still be alright? (Both in a sense that I would understand what's going on and in a sense that I wouldn't catch any spoilers.)

      Thanks!
      ```

      - u/SvalbardCaretaker:
        ```
        You should be fine with "Woke up" in regards to to understanding.  

        No major spoilers I can think of right now buuut its a 6-page spacebattles series so I can't guarantue that there aren't any spoilers in some offhand way.

        EDIT:strike that, there are major spoilers directly in the first chapter.
        ```

        - u/NTaya:
          ```
          I see! Thank you. Well, I'm likely to forget some minor ones by the time I actually get to reading Worm.

          Edit: Aww. :c Well, I'm not going to read that one yet, then.
          ```

          - u/Worthstream:
            ```
            On the other hand, if you skip the first chapter, that can be summed with: "a dungeon wakes up on an arid terrain and gets the ability to control bugs", you should be fine with only minor spoilers after. IIRC.
            ```

            - u/NTaya:
              ```
              I see! I'll try that, then.

                heads up, it hasn't updated in nearly 3 months, and the previous update before that was 2.5 months earlier (aka, 2 updates in the past 5 months). It seems to me that the author is losing interest and/or doesn't have as much time to write. I'm skeptical that it will be continued for very much longer.
                ```

          - u/LaziIy:
            ```
            Honestly, I read "woke up" after having read worm's first couple arcs several years ago and most of the Worm stuff went over my head.The second chapter pretty much starts the dungeon arc with very minor references made to Worm
            ```

      - u/PastafarianGames:
        ```
        There are (mostly vague) spoilers in terms of Taylor's (the main character of Worm) overall character arc in that story, if I remember right, so if you're strongly spoiler-averse go read Worm first.

        You absolutely do not have to read Worm to understand I Woke Up As A Dungeon, though.
        ```

      - u/Watchful1:
        ```
        There's definitely worm spoilers in "I Woke Up As A Dungeon, Now What". I'm pretty sure it spoils the ending of worm, at least in broad strokes.

        ```
        It fits exactly what you asked for, and I read it till its current update, only draw back is I feel like Ami is really not being pro-active at all, none of her "plans" work "as planned", which would make sense for someone Isekaied into a random world, but given her apparent intelligence and resources it rancles me a bit.

    For point 2, go over to the teratophilia subreddit's (which is nsfw) discord and look in the various sfw media-specific channels for recommendations. I joined it recently but haven't gone through to give a proper look yet, so I can't add anything specific here.

      ```
      I checked out the first few chapters. Being published, the work is well-edited, which is better than 99% of other LitRPGs, and the setting is interesting. Not a huge fan of the characters so far, but overall this seems fun indeed. I will keep reading it at some point in the future. Thank you!

    I.  I was recommended [A Lonely Dungeon](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/37231/a-lonely-dungeon) here a week or two back, and that was fun even if it's not a completely typical dungeon core fic. I remember enjoying Evil God Average as well, but it wasn't rational by any means and it's been a while since I read it so take that rec with a bit more of a grain of salt.

    II. Inhuman, intelligent, rational. The closest thing i can think of to that is [Dragon Harem Quest - Or: Saying You Were Gay Wasn't The Conversation-Ender You Hoped For](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/dragon-harem-quest-or-saying-you-were-gay-wasnt-the-conversation-ender-you-hoped-for.47186/), which I found myself enjoying after repeated reccomendations overcame the aversiveness from the title.  You might enjoy [Blood Thirsty](https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/blood-thirsty-dungeon-keeper-in-space.12569/)? That's the only other thing i currently recall enjoying that I think has a decent chance of being what you're looking for.

  So not really rational nor fiction, but I suspect there's a lot of people here who love Factorio. I just lost my whole week to Dyson Sphere Program, a Factorio like with 98% positive reviews on Steam.

  Anyway, the game is great and all but as an indie game developer myself it just completely blew my mind how a team of 4 people made this game in 2 years. It's strong at *everything*, it's ambitious technically challenging, but yet somehow the user experience is amazing too. And these guys made it in  2 years with no prior releases. If ever there was proof of that whole 10x more productive programmers thing, this is it. Like it's probably more like 100x more productive from the baseline.

    It's honestly amazing. There's so much attention to detail, and yet the scale of the game is huge. The trains blew my mind. 

    Although, fair warning: don't start playing this game if you have, like, anything at all you need to do in your life.

  Is there any Attack on Titan rational or good fanfiction?
  ```

- u/WildFowl82:
  ```
  I'd appreciate recommendations of written (web)novels with a protagonist that a therapist would label '**psychologically healthy**', or that centrally features the gradual development of such traits.

  In more detail, the protagonist could be someone who is (or develops into) an independent, psychologically-healthy individual with appropriate self-esteem. Able to set boundaries while still coming across as caring. Someone who believes in their own worth, is unfazed by others' judgements, isn't caught up in a judging view of the universe, doesn't worry about seeming intelligent or competent because they're not insecure about those things.

  The opposite of me, basically.

  An example is [Cinnamon Bun](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/31429/cinnamon-bun). Another okay fit is the MC from [Beware of Chicken](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/39408/beware-of-chicken) who doesn't feel any need to participate in the whole cultivation thing and just goes out to make friends. He's a bit of a Gary Stu, though. An in-between of Blue and Red from [PTOOS](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9794740/89/Pokemon-The-Origin-of-Species) fits, but neither one alone; Blue's confident but judging, Red's underconfident but accepting.
  A counter-example is Zorian in most of [Mother of Learning](https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/1/Mother-of-Learning), though he does grow out of it so maybe it's just a good example in the end. The best counter-example is probably HPJEV from [HPMOR](http://www.hpmor.com/chapter/1).

  (I know it's not a very /r/rational request. It's perhaps the opposite of what I think many people here like. I tend to like my protagonists clever more than loving. Trying to widen my horizons a bit. Hey, it's worth a try.)

    You might like [Demonology and the Tri-Phasic Model of Trauma: An Integrative Approach](https://archiveofourown.org/works/20177950/chapters/47807593) by Nnm. The protagonist is psychologically healthy as you describe, and helps another character who is not psychologically healthy become so.

    It's Good Omens fanfic, though, not really a web serial. You don't need to be very familiar with Good Omens to enjoy it.

    - u/ValuableBuffalo:

    Maybe non fiction would help, self help is helpful if you're humble enough to consume it.   Two things that work very well for me are:

    * Being grateful, it sounds cliche and dumb but it just works. It's weird, just add it as a daily task on your checklist and think of a few things you're grateful for. It makes me consistently happier, it works, as silly as it may sound.
    * Avoid disdaining things. I'm very judgmental, this helps avoid that. Same thing add it as a daily task on your checklist and do it. To elaborate a bit here's an example. Your internet is slow, most people would call it crap (disdaining it), all you have to do is avoid doing that. It's specially useful if you're like me and other peoples laziness annoys you, there were people that I couldn't stand before I started doing this.

    Lin Qi from Forge of Destiny may fit your request btw ;)
    ```

    - u/PastafarianGames:
      ```
      I love Ling Qi but she is absolutely not psychologically healthy. She's a walking rolodex of traumas and complexes; she's almost *defined* by them, even when it comes to the positive actions she takes (befriending people and especially Bai Meizhen). It takes her more than fifty chapters to loosen up enough to even *consider* having something in her life that isn't directly driving her towards cultivated strength, and she's consistently, utterly, remorselessly devoid of empathy to anyone other than the half-dozen people she's befriended.
      ```

      - u/fassina2:
        ```
        She's improving, which fits what the OP asked for. Idk how far you've gotten but she's been constantly becoming a better person. It's not fast, but for her only a little over a year has passed, if she continues at her pace by the time she's 20 she'll be more psychologically healthy than most people.

  I'm currently reading [Dead Tired] (https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/dead-tired.894343/), a fic where the main character is absolutely OP. Nothing is a match for him, not even the gods.

  And still it manages to be an interesting story, with how Harold is just curious about the world and how you get to discover it with him on his travels. A very good cast of secondary characters and great writing are a bonus, too.

  I'm looking for something similar, since the story is a work in progress and i've reached the end of it, and sinc ethe second book is turning into crack fic, and not scratching that particular itch anymore.

  I've seen Dead tired called an OCP story in the comments, so went looking for those. So far none managed to have an interesting protagonist in an interesting setting.

  Any suggestions?

          >very different from anything I've seen before

          It's my first (and so far only) novel-length work, but OCTO draws influence from works like *Crystal Society* and the *Antimemetics* series and *Cordyceps: Too Clever For Their Own Good* and too many other fantastic works to name. I wanted there to be an entry in the >!rational Lovecraftian/Gigerian kaiju xenofiction!< space, so I gave it my best shot.

    If you find Worm interesting, there's a load of OCP fics available there. I think [A Champion in Earth Bet](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-champion-in-earth-bet-worm-original-setting-story-only-thread.350777/reader/) is one of the better ones, pitting an avatar of heroism against the bleakness of the setting.

    Thanks for the rec! The dry wit reminds me of Douglas Adams at the moment.

    "A long distance teleportation done poorly can mean that the mage will appear in mid-air sideways, moving at great speeds, and with his lungs trying valiantly to exit from his mouth.

    Oh, and of course one would usually rather not appear buried in stone or halfway into something. You don’t often hear from those mages though."

    to clarify a bit there's two classes of stories about outside context problems (OCPs): 

    * stories where the OCP acts as a McGuffin and other entities are trying to understand / exploit it (e.g Iain M. Banks' *Excession* (which I believe is where the term originated), Peter Watts' *Blindsight*)
    * stories where one of the main characters *is* an outside context problem, and you get to see them tearing up the world (e.g, Dead Tired). 

    It sounds like you're mostly looking for the latter, so: 

    These ones have largely inhuman MCs:

    * [Love Crafted](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/29669/love-crafted) - an outside context problem is summoned into a generic fantasy world. It just wants headpats. (by the same author as Dead Tired, btw)
    * [A friendly voidling](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/40998/a-friendly-voidling) - an outside context problem is summoned into a very Discworld-esque universe. It just wants friends. It does not have a concept of boundaries - be they physical, emotional, or dimensional. (seems very clearly inspired by the previous story)
    * [Eldritch Entity On A Journey Of Self-Discovery](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/40038/eldritch-entity-on-a-journey-of-self-discovery) - a moderately depressed outside context problem essentially just stumbles into a particular reality. 

    These ones have human MCs who are just very powerful:   

    * [The Simulacrum](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/23173/the-simulacrum) - an entity crashes into some sort of simulation or something? and the simulation is probably a shounen anime? There's a lot of tropes at least, and the MC doing stuff nobody should be able to do. 
    * [Prophecy Approved Companion](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/35549/prophecy-approved-companion) - the Hero has arrived! The Hero has glitched out the game! None of the NPCs know how to deal with this!
    * [Sylver Seeker](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/36065/sylver-seeker) - one of the better "I was a mage before the system so I know how to do magic for real" stories. The MC ends up being an outside context problem because he can punch way above his apparent level by munchkining real magic.

    Overlord is the "I've been isekai'd as my video game character" trope, except the character is the last remaining member of a former top guild, is himself max level and gratuitously powerful, and he got isekai'd with his guild's base, resources, and npcs intact (who are now all fully sentient). The story is about the main character trying to establish himself in the world and carve out a place for the npcs he sees as his own children (and they happen to have more power than most nearby nations combined at their disposal, even if distributed over a significantly smaller population). That said, the main character is a ball of anxiety and insecurities, who constantly projects a façade of confidence and genius in order to live up to the expectations his underlings/children have placed in him, so there's quite a bit of comedy from his subordinates being blind to all this, and quite a bit of "the main character is flying by the seat of his pants" when it comes to anything more complex than combat or officeworker-level interpersonal management that pushes the story away from being anything rational.

    I've posted about Overlord a few times in previous recommendation threads, I am awful at using Reddit search though. Regardless, here's a brief comment I made last month for further detail:

    "Overlord is a good light novel series, but light novels are 100% an acquired taste, and the author of Overlord specifically loves his unusual and detailed perspective changes. For example, book 4 is 80% from the point of view of a kinda locally notable lizardman's journey, as the actual mc of the series sends one of his not-lieutenants to effortlessly conquer all the lizardman tribes. Books 12 and 13 are from the perspective of a paladin's squire, which sounds less engaging than it ends up being (also she is 100% Best Girl from the entire series, fight me)."

    Edit: Also the anime adaption really only hits the broad points of the story and anything that isn't directly plot relevant that it cheapens the experience. The first season is reasonable, but the next two go downhill, and the third also has a bunch of terrible cgi animation at critical points.

  There's an isekai litRPG I read the first volume of where the basic notion is that the evil empire is summoning large groups of Earthers because they get hyper-growth in skills or whatever, and then basically enslaving them. Ring any bells? I can't remember the name.

    The bnha fanfic I'm looking forward the most to is [A Precise Note](https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13488656/1/A-Precise-Note), by Sir Lucifer Morningstar. As you may deduce, the author is the edgiest writer you have ever seen, and his other stories are really dark. 

    Having said that disclaimer, I find the story fantastic. It has 100k words and updates slowly, but in that time it has touched many rational themes, in a world slightly darker (or maybe just more coherent) than in bnha canon. Izuku gets an OP quirk and is transformed by it very quickly. Different type of ethical problems, and what should you do with overwhelming power to better society is also discussed. The more powerful quirks of canon are made stronger, with Nezu being pretty much a precog and AFO being the overwhelmingly powerful he is supposed to be. 


    Having said that, if you prefer something more vanilla, [The heroic chronicles of a young man ](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-heroic-chronicles-of-a-young-man-youjo-senki-my-hero-academia.875316/) is a kinda crossover with Youjo Senki, with the main character being based on the male salaryman that would become Tanya, with a quirk that lets him fight somewhat similar to her. 
    The MC brings a very different perspective to heroics, and carries the misunderstandings of Youjo Senki. Updates frequently and it's in my top 3.


    For more crossovers there's [My hero school adventure is all wrong as expected](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/my-hero-school-adventure-is-all-wrong-as-expected-bnha-x-oregairu.697066/), a crossover with oregairu that has already been recommended here. As the other two, very recommended. Updates slowly, long chapters.


    Finally, there's [Dragonspawn](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/dragonspawn-my-hero-academia-si.696280/)
    , a SI where the main character's quirk is being a dragon. Updates semi frequently.


    If you like the recommendations written here, feel free to ask for more or share others you have liked. My preferences are in AU with new characters or different perspectives than in canon. Would also love to see another fic with a darker world than in canon, and with more powerful quirks.

        Nothing similar I'm afraid.  Currently I have been reading [Onizuku](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/onizuku-my-hero-academia-au.915180/), a currently very short (13k words) story where the japanese youkai exist and only few know of their existence, with families of exorcists being traditionally their hunters and protectors of humanity. 
        Izuku is a half oni, a man eating demon, and because of this, a very different person. The rest of the world is pretty much the same than in canon, with some of Izuku's classmates being youkai's themselves.
        Admittedly very short, but with lots of potential.


        Going away from bnha, and hoping that you share my taste in other ways, two of the fics that I have been loving  the most are [Hear the Silence ](https://archiveofourown.org/works/15406896/chapters/35757684) and [A Journey of Black and Red](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26675/a-journey-of-black-and-red). 

        The first one is a Naruto SI, interested in exploring trauma, society biases and character relationships. Currently in hiatus, 700k words, and very slow paced. 


        A Journey of Black and Red updates weekly in Royal road and is an original novel about vampires in the 1800s. The MC is converted into a vampire against her will, and the beginning is kinda dark, though it lightens considerably. The story has an incredible sense of humor, hates Twilight vampires and has the MC struggle to become the master of her own fate. 


        Finally, the author [Shadenight123](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/members/shadenight123.1556/) is a somewhat guilty pleasure of mine. His first stories are very edgy, and he usually written Self Inserts. Having said that, he writes a lot, and I love pretty much anything he writes. However, is not for everyone, and the MC of his stories is often very similar. I would recommend starting with his [RWBY](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/a-heart-of-ice-and-coffee-rwby-si.54448/) or [Avatar](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/the-shadenight123-corner-hugs-need-not-apply.15425/page-359#post-17132720) stories to see what he is about, the first having different "routes", with a very different feel between each route.

    I asked this and posted a bunch of my own recs 3 weeks ago,[ here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/lpq207/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/gog4ryk/) Since then I've got back on to Slouching Towards Nirvana, and have nearly finished [A Study of Firsts](https://archiveofourown.org/works/16340741/chapters/38231207) over the past two days, which is worth a tentative rec. That said, its all minor character interactions and fluff from the class of 1A adapting to sharing a dorm together, and kinda trends more towards semi-crackfic over time (which tbh is kinda fair given how little attention canon gives a bunch of kids spending time with one another is going to get them to change and grow together, when they have such grand aspirations as heroes especially, and how getting up to shenanigans seems inevitable given both the stressors and skills they all have, even if the fic lays it on a bit thick). If nothing else, props to the author having a chapter where everyone deals with dietary requirements and health concerns from quirks, but your mileage may vary and all.

    (Also I've technically been hashing out a bunch of stuff for a BNHA fic I'm planning myself these past few weeks since I regularly spend time I should be trying to fall asleep doing worldbuilding stuff on my phone's notes app and figured I should actually stick to a project and make something with from my habit. Also I figure fanfic will be good training wheels with established canon as a framework and an already existing readerbase so I don't feel like I'm shouting into an empty void when I start putting stuff out. Anyway I've had to split my notes into half a dozen different docs because of app word limits even if I'm sticking only to brief dotpoints because I hate typing on mobile. So yeah, watch this space)

  Does anyone have recommendations for Twilight fanfiction in the vein of Alicorn's [Luminosity](https://luminous.elcenia.com/)/Radiance? Or in general, recs for fanfics that take schlocky or underexamined settings seriously? No Naruto/HP recs though; I'm rather burnt out on those fandoms.

  And while I'm here, let me drop a few recs.

  [BIBLIOMANIA](https://mangadex.org/title/57650/bibliomania): Manga. Short, complete manga with gorgeous art, esoteric themes, and a plot that's utterly impossible for me to explain. Feels like reading a fever dream.

  [Schwarz-Rot-Gold](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/historical-complete-schwarz-rot-gold-a-german-civil-war-quest.916378/#post-73828720) : Quest. Navigate post-WW1 Wiemar Republic Germany through a 3-way civil war. Well researched historical (alternate-universe) fiction.

  [Useless Ponko](https://mangadex.org/title/36329/useless-ponko) : Manga. An old man receives a maid robot as a posthumous gift from his departed wife. Cute, funny, and occasionally philosophical.

  [My Father Became a Cute VTuber Girl](https://mangadex.org/title/48577/my-father-became-a-cute-vtuber-girl) : Manga. The Main Character discovers the VTuber he simps for is actually his father.

  [Dog Nigga](https://mangadex.org/title/43521/dog-nigga) : Manga (Western) . I don't know *what* the ***fuck*** is going on here. Good shit though.

  [Tearmoon Empire Story](https://mangadex.org/title/40472/tearmoon-empire-story) : Manga. Clueless princess gets sent back in time after her execution. Spends her time trying to avoid getting Robespierre'd. Think 'Otome Game Villain' but without the isekai.

  [Vigilante: Boku no Hero Academia Illegals](https://ww6.readmha.com/manga/vigilante-boku-no-hero-academia-illegals/) : Manga. Spinoff (Side story? Semiprequel?) to the main My Hero Academia manga. Features older, more mature characters and a closer view at the 'street level' of heroism.

  [Trust Once Lost](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/trust-once-lost-mlp-tg-tf-si.797022/#post-62113947): MLP:FiM fanfiction. HiE fanfic where the MC is stuck as a foal and has to work through some deep-seated trauma. Non-mlp fans probably won't care for it, but I know there are at least a few bronies on here.

  I just finished [The Righteous Mind,](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11324722-the-righteous-mind) and it's pretty good.  The author attempts to make people on different parts of the political spectrum understand each other better, by looking at how their views on morality differ.

  &#x200B;

  The book is basically a study on what morality is. People here would like it. There are a lot of interesting tidbits, and should help people have a better understanding of reality.

  Anything of a similar vein to Salvos?
  ```

  - u/GlueBoy:
    ```
    I didn't like Salvos very much, I thought it leaned way, way too much on the litrpg [brackets], particularly for fights, which made things pretty boring and repetitive. He [kicked] her away, and she threw a [fireball] at him, that kind of thing. 

    I did like Vigor Mortis, and the two have some similarities. They both have female leads that are earnest, blunt, loyal, selectively violent, and have an atypical personality. 

    Vigor Mortis isn't an litrpg, just a fantasy. It has detailed, well set up fight set pieces and there's an actual feeling of purpose and danger, rather than just farming [XP] again. Oh, and the world building is pretty impressive, IMO. ~~Also spoilers~~
    ```

    - u/FunkyFunker:
      ```
      Just want to say, for Vigor Mortis, the spoiler was a really fun surprise, so maybe avoid the spoilers if you'll read it anyway. It has a few issues, but I definitely am enjoying it, and I think the plot summary on RR really undersells it.

      ```
      Yeah I'm already caught up to vigor mortis. Personally I put salvos in that popcorn read like BTDEM or Azarnith Healer category. The writing style of Salvos gradually evolves to move away from what you're describing so I understand that.
