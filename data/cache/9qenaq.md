## [D] Monday General Rationality Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics!  Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world?  Have you:

* Seen something interesting on /r/science?
* Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
* Figured out how to become immortal?
* Constructed artificial general intelligence?
* Read a neat nonfiction book?
* Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?

  I ran into [this guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Rmj9vuCUh5zfZag0sVkYNCCI3lJEbqLjP79vkXT9cCo/edit#heading=h.nbcyuc45jzhs) in the so called "[Classified Thread](http://slatestarcodex.com/2018/10/19/classified-thread-5-classified-never-sinned-2/)", hosted on Slate Star Codex (Which is an excellent blog, btw, if you're interested in science, psychology, and sometimes politics).

  It describes an interesting technique for falling asleep. Its basic claim is that sometimes, you cannot force yourself to relax, and you should instead try to focus your attention. Specifically, It suggests focusing your attention on visual artifacts you can see while closing your eyes. (I suspect this technique could work with different focus as well, but this guide does not explore that option)

  does anyone knows any research on similar techniques? I'm curios how effective this could be. 

  This relates to my general interest in meditation-related topics - if anyone has sources on that (preferably evidence based, and with minimal spiritual-speak), I would appreciate it (-:

    If you want to learn more about meditation and liked Slate Star Codex, try his book recommendation [Mastering the Core Teaching of the Buddha](http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/09/18/book-review-mastering-the-core-teachings-of-the-buddha/).

    I haven't gotten around to reading it, but his book review makes me really excited about reading it when I have the spare time.

    I rarely have any difficulty sleeping, but this works for me when I do.

    Keep your eyes open, don't blink a minute or so. It works wonders, technically it requires some focus, while also tiring and drying your eyes which also makes you feel really sleepy, and fall asleep faster.

    Generally just avoid arguing or posting things on reddit before bed. At least for me, my brain get's into full power mode, think of every possible counterargument and make your counterarguments for it, that kind of thing.

    &#x200B;

    I also like watching really boring videos of boring games I like, i.e CK2, EU4 that kind of thing, or just reading bad verbose unedited fiction, that also knocks me out pretty quick, and by that I mean sleep on my chair, wake up because I dropped my mouse fast (which means I fell asleep holding it).

    &#x200B;

    Edit\* Also use f.lux and other similar programs, you can google what they do and why they are important.

  I am late. 


  Have been reading a story on RRL titled "[The Eagle's Flight ](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/9500/the-eagles-flight)", and so far I'm really impressed. 

  Now, I'm not smart enough to tell you why I think this story should be featured more in this subreddit, but I think it does belong here. 

  It has, what I think, the hallmarks of a good rational story. And if not, it's a great story I want to share to you anyway.
