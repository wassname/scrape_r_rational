An "in the style of a Wikipedia entry" piece of fiction about the first whole brain emulation. It's not mine, and it's really really good:

  If uploading and downloading human brains becomes possible in the next few decades, I'm going to see about getting a copy of /u/DataPacRat because of [LoadBear's Instrument of Precommitment](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nRSRWbAqtC48rPv5NG6kzggL3HXSJ1O93jFn3fgu0Rs/edit).

  (Datapacrat, if an instance of you wakes up in the future and is tasked to write recursively derivative rational fiction, you'll have a good idea of who's manipulating your sim.)

  EDIT: Why is this in negative karma? If you do not care what people had to say about the story 3 months ago, you should neither care what they have to say now. Thus you should not be voting in the comments and especially not downvoting links to previous discussion. Sheesh.

    I think some people interpreted the tone of your statement as suggesting that this is a "dup", i.e. a kind of "we just talked about this" / "we don't need to see this again so soon" / "you should stop giving OP your internet points, they're just reposting things they saw yesterday" vibe. Which, coupled with the fact that the original post was from months ago, would be wrong-headed if that *was* what you meant.

    But, of course, that's *not* what you intended to mean.

    You have to be very careful with tone when making succinct Internet comments, if there's a conventional/memetic "every thread has this type of post" comment, that your comment could be misconstrued as attempting to evoke.

    People like the moderators on Hacker News, the posters on /r/AskHistorians, etc., try to avoid this association by phrasing the pointer to previous conversations very deferentially to the current conversation. I think the well-known format for /r/AskHistorians goes something like "There's certainly always more that can be said on this topic, but there was a previous excellent discussion [here]."

    Interesting points about slavery in those comments. Thanks.

      Yeah. Is it slavery if you don't know that it's slavery and think that you have a pretty great life? I'd never really considered that before.

  After reading the story I think I am post-posthuman. I need a "do not upload" as well as a "do not resuscitate."

    Don't generalize from fictional evidence! (If you're serious). 

    It is a great story, but IRL, given the premises of the world, there is no way that this is economically viable. There's no way we would have brain uploading but not post human labor scarcity.
    ```

    - u/wren42:

      I've felt this way, but it seems like wishful thinking on the order of "all superintelligent AI must be ethical" to hold that no world could have uploading and want cheap minds to think about stuff
      ```

      - u/GreenSatyr:
        ```
        "All AI must be ethical" is silly, but, I still believe in the ethics of humans when collectively in an environment where all the scarcity factors that pit us against each other are gone.

        But that isn't my actual objection, my actual objection is that there is no way that it turns out the _cheapest_ way to get an algorithm to do labor is to make it simulate an _entire human_, who is _unwilling_ and then _force_ it to do the labor within a simulated environment, rather than just training a specific purpose machine to do it. What task can you imagine where that is the cheapest solution? It would imply that we can't replace human general intelligence even for incredibly rote tasks that no one wants to voluntarily do but that we _can_ simulate an entire human.

          Maybe education. Imagine a whole generation taught by Severus Snapes with guns to their heads.

          Meanwhile in real software development, we not only don't bother optimizing our software, we go so far as to make apps in Javascript and run them in what's basically a whole web browser rather than just coding for the platform, because "developer time" is seen as so valuable and "compute" can be had in bulk. Why bother coding for a task when you could just repeatedly simulate one person known to be a good worker?

        Not all nice things are unlikely. 
        Theres lots of ways the future could unfold, and lots of arguments why there wouldn't be a great amount of enslaved human minds. 

        Wanting cheap labour doesn't mean we live in a world of ubicuous slavery, at least in the developed world so it's not a sufficient condition. 

        Civilization is not maximally horrible, people care about other people and treating other humans badly has other consecueces. 
        It would be hard to have enslaved ems work on longterm wide reaching stuff for example, and if some of them manage to basically "get out of the box" you could have a movie style ai revolution only it makes more sense cause the "humans in robot suits" are actually humans. 

        Plus  personaly I think that it would be cheaper to have non-human AI do the work. 

        And yeah that doesn't guarantee there won't be ems suffering despite of all that but it's certainly not obious it's going to happen or that most ems will be slaves. 

        And you can try to influence the future so it's less likely to be bad.

          Agreed it's all possible, and nice to be optimistic.  I was responding to the assertion that there's "no way" ems could be used this way.  Given that we have ample historical and modern examples of slavery and poor working conditions for living humans, and given that markets appear to be a pretty entrenched system, I would argue it cannot be ruled out as a possibility that emulated minds would be used for work.
          ```

          - u/Amonwilde:
            ```
            Yes. The critique here presupposes that we would have non-emulated AI and thus be in a post-scarcity world, or that post-scarcity is a precondition for developing uploading. I think it's quite possible that rare things like cognition in general and especially cognition from individuals will continue to be valuable. I'm not saying it's the obvious or most likely future, but it's not unlikely, at least from what we know.

            I honestly think optimism here is somewhat unwarranted. AI will arise in a a framework that optimizes for making money, not for well-bring. It's fine to say "advocate for the good ending," but I have no significant power to make an impact here, and others do, and are incentivized to use ems, if they are developed, to create more wealth and capital. 

            If faced with a coin flip between infinite heavens and infinite hells, I'd prefer to take my chances with oblivion.

      Personally, I believe, we could already be post human labor scarcity. 

      But we don't want to invest/research into that direction, because where else will the masses get their pay?

      You could automate all jobs, minus the creative/thinking ones, but then, where will the manual laborers without those skills get a living pay?

        Either we get universal basic income or the majority of people are going to starve.

        We are not even close, our AI can't so much as deliver a package up a flight of unfamiliar stairs yet. We _just_ got self driving cars and delivery drones for tiny packages, and i think that's pretty much the state if the art. The rich would do it if they could, paying people is expensive. It'll be at least a few decades i think, if not way more.
