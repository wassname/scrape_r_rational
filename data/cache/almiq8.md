## Rational fiction for 10-12 year old students?

### Post:

I am starting a book club with my 5th grade students (age 10-12) and am looking for fiction they could get through which would introduce them to modern SF themes -- especially rational-type stuff, or anti-death-status-quo type stuff.

For instance, I would want kids coming away from reading the book ready to discuss themes and implications of hibernation, time dilation, time travel, space elevators, ramscoops, etc. Not all of these, necessarily, but certainly some.

Do you have recommendations? Do you remember SF you were reading at that age? Thanks.

  Ender's Game was taught at my highschool to 14 year olds. Probably too mature/difficult for 10 year olds, but I think it could be okay for 12 year olds.

  I think just going through Asimov's short stories would be best for 10 year olds.
  ```

  - u/DuplexFields:
    ```
    Asimov had a short book that's perfect for elementary school students, "[The Best New Thing](http://asimov.wikia.com/wiki/The_Best_New_Thing)."  I first read it in a fiction anthology textbook at that age, and later found it in the library as its own book.

    It's about a couple of kids who live on the moon who build up their strength with exercise in anticipation of their first trip to Earth, the homeworld of their parents.  It combines a sense of wonder and a love of science, and I remember it to this day.  I'd recommend starting their SF adventures with this story.

    Ender's game has prequels and sequels which are also awesome!
    ```

    - u/VorpalAuroch:
      ```
      The sequels are definitely over the heads of most 12-year-olds.
      ```

      I try not to think about the Ender-following sequels, it gets... weird towards the end of them to say the least.  I thoroughly enjoyed the ones following Bean though.
      ```

    ```
    As one of the most obsessive Ender's Game fans in the world, and also as a lifelong teacher and middle school teacher, I think "teaching" Ender's Game absolutely kills it for the kids who would otherwise have benefitted most.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      That can be argued to be true for every book out there. What makes Ender's Game worse to teach than anything else?
      ```

      - u/TK17Studios:
        ```
        More precious to begin with, more fragile when forced down students' throats.  Higher potential high being sacrificed, greater delta as a result of the damage of "being taught."
        ```

  Diane Duane's *Young Wizards* series is great, though probably better for ~7th grade and up.  Lovely blend of hard SF and character-driven epic fantasy.

  Arthur C Clarke's *Dolphin Island* is classic SF and great for younger readers.

  Maybe *Rendezvous with Rama*? 

  TBH I'm not sure there's much kid-friendly hard SF; and my own childhood solution of "read it all anyway" may not suit everyone (especially if you're a teacher). Maybe play *Kerbal Space Program*? 

  Going a bit softer, Asimov's robots short stories are also good, and not too adult. Anne McCaffery's *Talents* trilogy (fairly short).

  Actually, David Weber wrote a young reader's trilogy in the Honorverse, that would be great too.
  ```

  - u/awesomeideas:
    ```
    Of course I'm seconding the recommendation for *Young Wizards*, but I don't think it's necessary to wait until 7th grade. I read through to the fifth book in 2nd grade and I feel like I got a lot out of it.
    ```

    - u/PeridexisErrant:
      ```
      I just have trouble calibrating because I read everything my parents had by Tolkein and Frank Hebert when I was ~12.  The New Millennium editions are probably a bit more approachable :-)
      ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Rendezvous with Rama is definitely content appropriate but probably a pretty dense and difficult for a 5th grade reading level.
    ```

  Artemis Fowl
  ```

  - u/Mason-B:
    ```
    Yea this should be higher, the earlier books especially. It's definitely not whole hog rational, but it certainly leans that way heavily, though it is also a mainstream adventure book. And it has the benefit of being meant for children.
    ```

  - u/LimeDog:
    ```
    Plus the movie is coming out sometime soon!

    I would absolutely say the first two books are good for young readers, after that the series seems to lose its cleverness.
    ```

    - u/mistborn101:
      ```
      I disagree.. I loved the opal deception and Artemis complex.. last guardian was weird though
      ```

      - u/LimeDog:
        ```
        I very quickly got tired of Koboi as an antagonist. As the later novels came out it felt like it was less about outsmarting Opal and more about action moments and occasional tech advantages. Fowl didn't have as many mastermind class plans as in the first few books.
        ```

        - u/mistborn101:
          ```
          Yeah the series lost its mojo at some point
          ```

- u/Calsem:
  ```
  The bartimaeus trilogy is really good and funny too. I don't remember how rational it is but from what I do remember it seems like a book /r/rational would enjoy.
  ```

  - u/Makin-:
    ```
    It's great, but I think it might be a bit too dark for 12 year olds, a lot of bloody character deaths and the general cynical atmosphere. Artemis Fowl is probably a better fit.
    ```

    - u/Nimelennar:
      ```
      I wouldn't really call Artemis Fowl rational,  Especially not the worldbuilding, where the written language of a civilization older than England somehow decodes into English, and half of the names are English puns.  "LEP-Recon" never fails to evoke a cringe in me.
      ```

      It's fine

  for time dillation and early sci fi themes there's a book i read at that age: marcos millions (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco%27s_Millions) the main premise is a boy who likes to explore and then finds a portal to this other world and solves a problem and then manages to get a box that can change the speed of time so there's a lot of things relating to that in the book though its not the central focus.

  Echoing some other posters i think asimov is surprisingly approachable at young ages. I would probably recommend the foundation books as a particularly good example.

  *Augie and the Green Knight* by Zach Weinersmith was recommended by Eliezer Yudkowsky, if my memory is correct. I have a Kickstarter copy of the book, and must say it is a very good children's book.

  I was reading Great Sky River. You should have them read that. It's a fun romp across a deathworld where humans are being subjected to slaughter by machine lifeforms, with an upbeat ending. People live with the recorded, simulated personalities of their dead ancestors talking as voices in their head, to preserve culture and knowledge in a world where knowledge is trending down, instead of up. It should be enough to get them started. Once they're hooked, the prequels and sequels to that book touch on many of the themes you're talking about.
  ```

  Second the *young wizards* suggestion.

  SF is really tough 'cause the themes are usually more adult (not necessarily romance). Most SF is going to be YA which is 12-13+

  But, some thoughts: *[The Time Machine](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2493.The_Time_Machine),  Animorphs, [David Birckenhead](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16060193-ship-s-boy) (if only for the anthropomorphized/uplifted bunnies), probably and all of [Larry Dahners' series](http://www.laury.dahners.com/Stories.html) (though it should be noted that while good, all his books are basically the exact same story rehashed yet again), [Songreaver's Tale](https://www.goodreads.com/series/114468-the-songreaver-s-tale) (not SF, but feels more rational-y), [Grand Central Arena](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6948420-grand-central-arena), Card's [Homecoming saga](https://www.goodreads.com/series/40410-homecoming-saga) could be fun*

  If they were just a bit older I'd suggest the [Runelords series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Runelords). Not SF

  Different Kinds of Darkness is short and about kids their age. I don't think the language is too difficult. The totalitarian theme might need to be explained to them.

  I was mostly reading nature books at that time. Jack London, My Side of the Mountain, Swiss Family Robinson. These seem almost like SF precursors to me. There's a focus on mechanics and engineering and rational planning for survival in a lot of them.
  ```

  - u/PeridexisErrant:
    ```
    *Hachet* and sequels, too.
    ```

- u/VorpalAuroch:
  ```
  There is [Nyssa in the Realm of Possibility](http://nyssa.elcenia.com/), which is a rationalist Phantom Tollbooth pastiche and really good. However, it's not entirely published yet; Alicorn is serializing it, publishing two chapters a week. There are 26 chapters and 18 are published, so it will be out in full by the end of February.
  ```

  - u/VorpalAuroch:
    ```
    Original-flavor Phantom Tollbooth is pretty good as well.
    ```

- u/hyphenomicon:
  ```
  I suppose Animorphs is sci-fi, now that I think about it, but many books in the series are weak, and the companion books, like Visser, while stronger, also have more difficult language and will require previous exposure to the series.
  ```

- u/Hidden-50:
  ```
  There are probably a lot of "actual paper" books out there that do a good job of introducing someone to SF themes; but I'm not sure which to recommend.

  The anti-death theme is probably mostly in stories whose authors have read HPMoR. Most of those are fanfiction or other web-published works.

  For fanfiction, the best starting point would be something based in a world that the student is already familiar with.

  ---

  If they've read Book 1 of Harry Potter (or watched the movie / etc), HPMoR itself may be suitable. I know some (at the time) 8th-graders who have read it, at least, which should put them at around 13 years.

  Another world that most kids are familiar with is Pokemon, so maybe daystarEld's Origin of Species would be okay. I'd encourage you to first read through whatever you end up recommending, though, as I'm not sure I'd remember any problematic scenes. There's a scene where somebody's been killed by a Beedrill, iirc, but I don't recall how graphic the description of that actually was.
  ```

- u/None:
  ```
  *Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality* is both a fun read *and* teaches people some interesting things from a number of different subjects such as psychology, and...some others.

  Also, it's important to remember that children past the age of eight have clear concepts between fantasy and reality, so they can probably handle rather visceral stuff (just not too visceral, mind you), but it's mostly the administration that will get on your case if you show anything that you can't reasonably justify.
  ```

  - u/justletmebrowse68:
    ```
    HPMoR has some questionable content (“As soon as I’m old enough to rape her”, etc) for a school book club with 11 year olds. Line managers and angry parents notwithstanding, I think that those kinds of things should probably be discussed outside of a school setting.
    ```

    - u/meterion:
      ```
      Not to mention, even if these are bookish 10-12 year olds, a 600k word monster like MOR is outrageously long for a book club to try to get through, it'd take at least 6 months if not more than a year to finish. Spending that much time on a single book would be almost missing the point of a book club.
      ```

        I don't know. _Methods_ is a [660,000 word](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Methods-of-Rationality) work [divided into six books](http://www.hpmor.com/); let's peg them at 110,000 words each. Compare with [the original _Harry Potter_ books](https://wordcounter.io/blog/how-many-words-are-in-harry-potter/):

        Title | Wordcount
        ---|---
        _Sorcerer's Stone_ | 77,000
        _Chamber of Secrets_ | 85,000
        _Prisoner of Azkaban_ | 107,000
        _Goblet of Fire_ | 191,000
        _Order of the Phoenix_ | 257,000
        _Half-Blood Prince_ | 169,000
        _Deathly Hallows_ | 198,000
        Total | 1,100,000

        I read the first three _Harry Potter_ books in middle school (that's ages 11-13 for you non-Americans). They took me one week each to finish, and I'm a pretty slow reader for a nerd (I _still_ subvocalize!). So if we assume the kids can read one _Methods_ book per week, they should be able to get through it in one and a half months (if the club meets monthly, you could assign the first three books on the first month and the next three books on the second, so you could get through the entire work in two months).

        However, this is all theoretical; I agree that the content of _Methods_ is a poor match for 10-12 year olds. If _Methods_ were a movie it would be at least PG-13, maybe R depending on how graphically the troll and graveyard scenes were adapted.
        ```

        - u/meterion:
          ```
          Consider, however, that one of the benefits of a book club is discussing various facets and themes of a book in detail, moreso than trading reviews at the finish line. In a way, it would be missing a different point of having a book club.

          Especially for the kind of thinking-heavy content OP wants to introduce, reading material should be paced moderately and discussions frequent. Like in the first quarter or so of MOR, where each chapter is basically a series of parables and thought experiments loosely tied together by plot, those kids would have arbitrage, fermi estimates, energy conservation, and so on blow right through their heads because there is way too much going to comprehensively discuss at that pace.

      ```
      Strongly disagree. 11-years-old (or younger) is precisely the time to talk about consent. The only thing content wise that kids might have trouble with is the gore (i.e. the troll scene).
      ```

      - u/justletmebrowse68:
        ```
        Consent, yes. Personal autonomy, yes. Both can be embedded in drama or taught explicitly without discussing sexual assault. Sex Ed at that age broadly covers puberty, if covered by the school at all. We don’t live in a world where teachers can get away with sexual assault being casually discussed in an assigned text.

        Imagine the letters
