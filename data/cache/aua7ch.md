  “Instruments.”

  “Yeah, like I said, tools.”

  I love it. Bunch of great lines this chapter, really, like “Nowhere. I’m from the other place.” Seeing Giran’s mood whiplash was well sold, particularly given how little interaction we had with him here and in canon.

  Barely made it this time. I risked pushing it to next week but in the end this weekend was really prolific for me as I wrote more than 4500 words. I'm also writing a special that will begin introducing some of the DBZ characters (specifically the Saiyans and Frieza), so look forward to that at some point!

    Really great work keeping at it!

    And of course I look forward to reading it, but I really admire your writing discipline too!

    You rock!

    And your story rocks!

      Thanks! I've been actually swinging back and forth between different ideas (especially an Harry Potter one that I've started and rewritten at least three times now), so that slows down the process a bit. I'd really like to work in parallel on something shorter and different, just for the sake of variety (since I won't get that nice feeling of having wrapped up a story from this one for quite a while) but yeah, with my job and all I'm often just too tired to produce anything decent.

        Just out of curiosity, what's your idea for the Harry Potter fic? :)

      So my expectation is correct.   
      So... we will most likely see him fighting Goku soon.  
      Keep it up, great fanfic, I check for your updates every few days.

  Really now.

    I'm unsure how that would work when said out loud, but I like it nonetheless.

    Look, Max is *really* enthusiastic.

  I guess that technically [my predictions](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/amotxh/comment/efnmrj2) about who beats who in fights have not been wrong so far, but the chapter still wound up going a different way than I thought. It was pretty obvious that Mai had some evil plan to enact with being in the tournament. I thought she would use some trickeries or hidden techniques to advance to the final match before unleashing her endgame, but in hindsight she just wanted access to the backstage. Still not sure what she gets out of shooting Giran, maybe it's a distraction or something.
  ```

    ```
    The outcomes weren't exactly shocking. We knew Gohan and Goku had to win their fights, and Muten losing in some contrived way to Mai would have been stupid. In the only match left we have Krillin who needs to finish his arrogance arc against a stronger opponent than Yamcha, and Yamcha himself who can't be too successful or it would diverge way too much from canon.
    ```

      > Yamcha himself who can't be too successful or it would diverge way too much from canon

      Being Yamcha is suffering. That is one of the unchangeable laws of the universe.
      ```

  - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
    ```
    She's working for the Instruments. He had the stone Dragon Ball, and the Ptero tribe knows their plans but has officially pledged to be neutral (chapter 17), while sneakily sending Giran on a mission to undermine them.

    Also, speaking of your predictions, my question was why you'd assume Mai could win against Roshi, but that was already discussed in the comments. As seen here, Mai's just not on that level.
    ```

    - u/Grasmel:
      ```
      Shit, you're right, forgot about the dragon ball. I guess that's what happens when I read a story as it comes out, instead of waiting until it's complete like I usually do.
      ```
