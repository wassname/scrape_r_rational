## [Q] Where is the best place to put original content?

### Post:

I'm currently working on an original (non fanfic) story and so am wondering were do you guys consider the best places to read/write stories on?

  I honestly like Archive of Our Own a lot - the default format is clear and nice to read, it's got an easy interface to use, and it supports downloading automatically generated .epub / .mobi / .pdf / .html and ALSO it's supported by the FanFicFare fanfiction downloader for Calibre. 

  Fictionpress is sort of garbage in terms of interface and useability, but it's also supported by fanficfare at least and it's still readable.

  Wordpress-based blogs host several pieces of writing I like a lot - Unsong, Worm, etc. The formatting is almost always clear and fine to read, but involves more setup work on the author's end. However, as far as I know, there aren't any really good automated tools to make wordpress into portable formats automatically and I lose fanficfare compatibility to monitor / download fics into a calibre archive for me. This is less of a problem if the story is either already all done or is updating with great regularity.

    WordPress usually doesn't work as well on mobile too. Especially loading the entire comment sections and having a stupidly small scroll bar because of that.

  Wordpress blogs are fine, e.g. unsongbook.com.

  Your own website might or might not be better, depending on the aesthetic you're going for. For example, I quite like localroger.com/prime-intellect/mopi1.html

  Self-publishing as a pdf or getting onto google books is also an option, but probably requires you to know your way around typesetting at least a little. A medium-successful example would be https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tYyxCQAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&lpg=PP1&source=bl&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false

    ```
    Speaking of "your own website", Github Pages gives you all the control of "just throwing some HTML up somewhere" with none of the worries about *where* (you.github.io, with optional custom domain), *how* (`git push`), or about maintaining servers or paying for bandwidth or anything similar. Plus, if you decide you hate Github one day, "exporting" your site is unnecessary: you've already got it.

    (You can achieve the same benefits at a slightly lower level using e.g. S3 + CloudFlare—which I used to do for some of my own personal website projects—but when the point is just removing all stumbling-blocks in the way of *putting up your writing*, I honestly don't think it's worth the extra bother.)

  Anywhere but FF.net?

  It's not hard to get "wall of text" style content right.
  ```

    ```
    True, but I know many big authors have been moving away from Spacebattles due* to nasty moderators so I want to make sure the site I use is a good one.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      If you like spacebattles, you'll like sufficient velocity and questionable questing, which are basically clones with incrementally less moderation of content. Forum-style threads with robust formatting and a few organizational tools for authors mean you'll get discussion that engages directly with the story.
      ```

- u/noggin-scratcher:
  ```
  https://www.fictionpress.com/ is very similar-looking to fanfiction.net but intended for original work. 

  Speaking as a reader I mostly don't mind where you put things so long as I can sign up for email notifications.
  ```

- u/FuguofAnotherWorld:
  ```
  Archive of Our Own has the best features, SpaceBattles in the creative writing board will get you the most passing readers and community interaction. Sufficient Velocity is SpaceBattles with slightly different mods about half the readers. I use SpaceBattles, Sufficient Velocity and Fanfiction.net, because I figure I get more readers from using all three than just the one, although it means I have to spend more time correcting spelling errors and uploading.

  ```
  I have built a website specifically for rational fiction - [rationalfiction.io](http://rationalfiction.io). Come check it out, I think it would be a good place to post your story =)
