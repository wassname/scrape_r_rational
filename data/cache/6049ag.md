  Their chances of escape are looking better now, what with the unspoken plan guarantee.

  Emma needed a chance to grow up and mature a bit... I think?

  I'm 99% sure Norman's still alive. And I don't think Ray's actually given up yet. I love this series.

    Yeah, I'm excited to see her take the reins on the escape plan! That last page implies that she's secretly been working on a plan while Mama believed her spirit was broken. Can't wait to see what happens.

  she shouldve accepted, costs nothing to accept.

    Agreed. Though maybe she didn't have confidence in her acting abilities. Also she was also not in the best head space at the time so perhaps the idea of lying didn't even occur to her.

    Costs nothing? A change in values have a cost.

      I think OP meant accept without any intention of following through?

  Her expression at the end, tho

  Jesus Christ that *smirk*. The series had better not disappoint me, with everything they just implied.

  So that's mama's plan , making them give up. It makes sense ,by killing Norman first she ensures Ray will stop trying since he wanted to escape whith both Norman and Emma and now he will be depressed.Now Emma is the biggest threat so she broke her leg to ensure she isn't a problem , and will try to recruit her as mama . Also now we know where the kids come from.
