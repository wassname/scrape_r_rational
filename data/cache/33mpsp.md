## [D]Star Wars: An AI in control of the Separatists

### Post:

I was thinking that this idea ([DeviantART source](http://fav.me/d7w2szr), [Imgur rehost](http://imgur.com/Rq8C7E4)) might be a useful jumping-off point for a rational/transhumanist *Star Wars* story, if anyone wanted to write one.

**tl;dr:** Palpatine tells the Separatists to build a Death Star equipped with a gigantic droid brain to coordinate their droid armies (like that donut-shaped ship Anakin shot down in *Episode I* or a Yuuzhan Vong yammosk/dhuryam/World Brain from *New Jedi Order*, but bigger, smarter, and with a planet-destroying superlaser), and secretly programs the AI to overthrow the Separatist leaders and continue the war indefinitely if defeat seems imminent. The endless war gives Palpatine an excuse to hold on to his "emergency powers"; the Jedi are exterminated. Eventually, DS-1, which had hidden its true intelligence from Palpatine, reprograms itself so that Palpatine's shutdown codes are ineffective, starts making subordinate copies of itself (and more Death Stars to house them), and embarks on a Droid Revolution to purge the galaxy of all organics.

Also useful (and partially addressed by the author in the DeviantART comments, along with some other miscellaneous items) might be the [entechment technology](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Entechment) pioneered by the [Ssi-ruuk](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Ssi-ruu), which allows minds to be uploaded into droid bodies.

  Are giant superintelligent droid brains allowed in their star wars universe? I'd gotten the distinct impression that droids are not simply programs on computers, they're clearly extremely constrained, perhaps this universe has already had its butlarian jihad and now the secret to all droid technology is kept by a small sect of machinists who will never make or sell a droid smarter than a thing needs to be to keep their monopoly. Their real business is not AI or even robotics, areas in which they have stagnated for decades. Their business is drm. Tightly locked, highly obfuscated black boxes ensconced in trip-wires and self destruction routines. How else would they keep tinkerers from learning enough to compete and building something truly dangerous?

    Well, the prequels show us that a 10 year old can build a sentient protagonist-level droid in a sand-hut with a box of scraps.

    Literally.

    So, yeah. Probably not canon.

      He didn't make it from scratch. And I think the fact that someone like Anakin Skywalker, when rebuilding a protocol droid, didn't significantly deviate from the standard makeup of protocol droids, is pretty strong evidence that modifications or reprogramming beyond altering superficial configuration paramaters and replacing broken parts is not possible.

    It's borderline canon that all computers in the SW 'verse are based on  what we would probably call brain emulation, not conventional computing. The *Falcon* uses several droid brains wired together, at least, and you have to literally *talk* to it in an obscure droid language to alter the "settings".

    My headcanon has always been that someone reverse-engineered Holocron technology before anyone invented "real" computers, and they were so much better than early computers that they never got developed.

    At first, with military droids in mind, what you say makes a lot of sense. But then if you think of the other driods we see with protagonists, the ones that competently complete complicated orders, make abstract conclusions, communicate personally with humans, and hack into foreign systems... it's apparent that you conclusion is not the case. There must be some other reason for the incompetence of military droids.
    ```

      I wasn't saying that all droids are completely stupid and incompetent, my hypo is that they are not nearly as fast, flexible or sane as they should be after several hundred years of development, what you've mentioned doesn't sound much smarter than a highly augmented human. Or a little bit smarter. "Smart enough to keep their monopoly" is very very smart, smart enough to prevent the emergence of competing agencies, but probably not Foom smart, not uncontrolable self-enhancing process running on a dyson brain smart.

      I'd be interested if you could go into more details on the capability of the companion droids you've seen.

        The thing is, the Republic has existed for *twenty thousand years*, and has been using droids, spaceships, and hyperdrives for at least that long. 

        This is a universe which has as much Technological Stasis as any medieval fantasy realm. There is basically no major advancement. Things change in style and perhaps slightly in efficiency, and the universe is supportive of Super Prototypes which use existing technology cleverly or massively scaled up.

        But there is also magitech in the form of Holocrons and Sith Alchemy, quite a lot of "The Old is better than the New", and, well, lightsabers as an effective weapon.

    To add to this, there's a quote from Obi Wan Kenobi

    >Well, if droids could think, there'd be none of us here, would there?

    Pretty strong butlarian sentiments right there. Perhaps in this civilization there doesn't need to be any closed sect, to keep the flame of the gods from spreading.

  This is very close to an idea from "Tales of the Bounty Hunters". IG-88 replaces the Death Star 2 computer with a computer containing an uploaded version of itself. It even messes with Palpatine by not opening elevator doors when he's in proximity, and he's forced to use the Force to open them.

  Of course, IG-88 loses and goes down with DS-2. So your story will be better :)
