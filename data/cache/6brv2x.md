  This is mostly a collection of topics about which I feel Unsong underperformed relative to my (high) expectations. These should be read while taking into account that overall I enjoyed the story.


  SPOILERS AHEAD

  **The bad parts:**

  A weak point is the relative uselessness of Unsong (the organization), which is (1) underpowered relative to the real important entities, like angels, demons, Cometspawn, etc; (2) quite useless at hoarding names and (3) becomes completely irrelevant after book 1. From the title of the story (and the logo), one would expect it would be this overly important organization that would influence the events and characters in the book, and this expectation is broken without even being acknowledged.

  Similarly, the extremely scary Malia could use some more screen time. She is kinda reduced to the role of a blood bag.

  As someone else has said, Metatron is supposed not to talk, but he decides to disguise himself as human and steal a boat to search for himself ar some point. Just so that the seed of the universe grows into something good or something to that effect. The angels actually lie/are wrong when they say that Metatron rides on top of a purple boat which is actually the Leviathan. This is annoyingly misleading for the reader.

  The chapter about the War of the Angels is veeeery inconsistent regarding the angels. They go from praising God for 7 days and 7 nights to talking like they're living in a SSC post. It's just too jarring.

  Sarah, the kabbahlistic secret weapon (as well as the Vital Name + ensouled Tharmas) is not used in a meaningful way, and the whole sacrifice thing is undone in a couple of chapters after TOK unceremoniously burns the supercomputer as a side effect of killing Caelius. While it might get across the idea that all resistance is futile before the might of TCK/TOK, it comes out as a little underwhelming.

  Globally, the pacing is a little off. It takes way to long for us to discover that TCK is actually an important main character and not a minor background event. I felt somewhat betrayed as I felt that the story was straying further and further away from the awesome atmosphere of this fictional depiction of the Bay Area Unitarians (which is still my favorite part of the book). I eventually adjusted, though.

  After giving us every indication that it's easy to distinguish a Golem from a human corpse, the book has TCK faking his death with a Golem capable of fooling the Cometspawn. Simeon does believe that fooling them with a Golem might be possible, but we've already seem him being wrong about the Drug Lord and the Captain, so I don't think his opinion was meant to be taken as gospel.

  Aaron's misinterpretation of the "fall of a bird" prophecy is irrealistic and out of character. He doesn't even consider the possibility that Robin is the bird, after mentioning that TCK was brokenhearted after her death one or two paragraphs above. The reader doesn't know her name yet, but Aaron does. On a positive note, I really like the fact that his kabbahlistic deduction is visibly very weird and sounded wrong at the time (at least to me).

  The "anthropic" explanation for all the coincidences is not very satisfying, but that's probably just my personal preference.

  The mechanics of telepathy are poorly understood by the reader, even if they are familiar to the characters. Telepathy seems to mostly work according to the whims of the plot, which narratively is a bad thing.

  The story didn't really gain much for being a serial instead of being published in one go or on bigger chunks.

  The African soul inconsistency is never addressed: how come many africans don't have a soul and are perfectly ordinary humans while Sara turns into a general artificial intelligence the moment she receives hers?

  My other criticisms are related to (lots of) little details, mostly inconsistencies, and nothing about the large scale structure of the novel. They are inevitable for a project of this magnitude without a proper editor. An editor could also "fix" many of the "flaws" I mention here.

  **Overall I have to say it's quite good. Among my favorite parts:**

  Book 1 is amazing - the depiction of the fictional version of the Bay Area ruled by the theonomic corporations is one of the best things I've read on the internet. I'd have liked more of this.

  Props for giving an answer to theodicy. I didn't think the story would actually do it.

  I now love biblical whale puns. It's my favorite genre of puns.

  Interesting "local" puzzles (the way Unsong discovers the name generating computer, the mystery of the Panama canal, the angel library code, the secret of the seventh sail, the identity of the Captain - or at least the fact that Metatron possesses him sometimes). This is in contrast to the large scale puzzles, which are impossible to guess with any certainty (who is TOK? Why can Malia see Ana while she is invisible? What/who is the drug Lord? Which Golem(s) has Gadiriel created before Sarah? Why did the name stop working? It turns out that the Confounding name confounds people without them noticing and can rewrite Aaron's memories in such a way that he actually holds in his mind a valid mnemonic of 72 letters that makes sente o.O).

  Most of Aaron's kabbahlistic rambling moments are great too.

  The universe is colorful and interesting.

  The distortions of real history are really great, and even better are the tidbits of real history/bible verses/talmud references so outrageous that they seem fake.

  The broadcast chapter is great.

  Chapter 72 is suitably bleak, especially the very last part. It did feel a little rushed, though.

  The epilogue, even if very rushed contrasts nicely with the overly bleak ending of chapter 72 (even if Thamiel's role is a little obscure). It mixes nicely with the Blake references throughout the book.

    > Aaron's misinterpretation of the "fall of a bird" prophecy is irrealistic and out of character.

    Aaron misinterpreting prophecies is TOTALLY in-character. See the 'Miss American Pie' interlude.

    > The African soul inconsistency is never addressed: how come many africans don't have a soul and are perfectly ordinary humans while Sara turns into a general artificial intelligence the moment she receives hers?

    I don't think that's an inconsistency. It simply may be that having a soul is a sufficient, but not necessary condition for, um... let's call it 'apparent consciousness'.

    But if we're talking inconsistencies, I can think of two major ones:

    * The Shrouded Constitution anachronism
    * We are told angels can't use Names, but the SCABMOM ritual contains an invocation of a Name. It seems Uriel shouldn't have been able to perform it with Sohu; this is never addressed.
    ```

    - u/Ninmesara:
      ```
      I don't think your first point is a very serious one. It's just a "timing" issue, right? It can be solved by editing a couple of lines of dialog. A more serious timing issue is Ana's possession by the drug lord, which seems to happen several hours after the events in Vegas. Scott promised he would fix that one eventually (this one actually made me think that the Drug Lord was making an empty threat until Scott corrected me in the comments).

      I had failed to notice your last inconsistency! This one's a big one. Maybe it could be solved by making Uriel use the name through some kind of celestial kabbahla (plucking the letters out of thin air) while Sohu says the name? That would be (more) consistent.

      Regarding the African problem: it's serious in my opinion because at the time it seems to validate Aaron's perception that ensouling a computer is totally safe, as humans with or without souls are very similar. I thought the whole point of the Madrid conference was to show us that something else might be involved in making Sarah conscious, besides the Vital Name (God's intervention, Raziel behind the Scenes, etc).
      ```

      - u/CreationBlues:
        ```
        Remeber, current epoch humans are different from the humans that were created by god. Remeber how trees were redesigned to run on math? A similar process was undertaken for humans, designing them so that they could run without divine light, solely on math. Since we don't see any west Africans after Uriel's machine fails, it's impossible to say what effect that had on them.

        What Sarah demonstrates, I think, is that you can artificially give anything, from dust to a computer, sentience with the ensouling name, and that with math you can also give things something equivalent to sentience, though not hooked up to whatever divine machinery cares about souls.
        ```

    - u/Ninmesara:
      ```
      Regarding the Prophecy: first, does Aaron really misinterpret the American Pie that badly? He says some correct things, like God's judgement being suspended (hell is destroyed and all that). And we actually never get a completely explained version of the song. Second, father Ellis's interpretation is almost as wild as Aaron's and we only see him interpreting a bit of it (the bit he interprets is correct though).

      On the other hand, for the prophecy of the bird you have: (1) the Cometspawn send for the Sercret of TOK shortly after Robin has died , leaving TCK brokenhearted (2) the prophecy talks about "the fall of a bird" (not even a sparrow! And while a robin isn't even a sparrow, a bird is) and (3) TCK listens to the prophecy and never tells anyone about it, for reasons. Both Aaron and Jinxiang completely fail to make the connection that was obvious the moment Robin was introduced... Try rereading that chapter knowing that TCK's wife is named Robin.

      I still thought TOK was Acher (I gave it a higher probability than TOK, something like 50% vs 45%), though, mostly because if the characters failed to make this obvious inference then maybe I was in the wrong (also because of the other reasons I mention in the comment where I talk about the puzzles).

      The Shrouded Constitution thing didn't seem like an anachronism to me at all.  I took it that the Shroudies were a preexisting political movement that Dick Cheney happened to belong to, and then he implemented their policy goals as president.
      ```

        - u/Frommerman:
          ```
          Given that Thamiel appears, for the first time ever, to have been soundly defeated, that the head which had previously been screaming (apparently in abject horror, poor thing), was begging for forgiveness, and that he allowed himself to be killed with his own weapon, I would say that's a resounding yes.

  All right, it's over! Now it's time for the fanfics!

  (In all seriousness, though, I doubt there will be any fanfics of UNSONG, simply because of the sheer amount of *knowledge* needed to write a kabbalistic scene that would do the original justice. If there ever is an UNSONG fanfic, it'll almost certainly have to be a group effort, which seems unlikely.)

  I think... I find this story disturbing on a personally existential level.... all of the horrific things the Comet King had to do because of some technicality that you have to be both evil to get into hell yet willing and able to use the Explicit Name to unmake it?  A universe were science and math prove to be a shallow facade constructed by an angel that happens to really like math?  The only consistent rule being the whimsical coincidences designed to barely redeem the universe enough from evil so that it is worth instantiating in the first place?  And of course... all the puns.

  The Epilogue... for some reason I don't quite trust the hive mind at the end to fix things.  You have... a kabbalist obsessed with puns and bizarre reasoning enough to make would should have been totally irrational and impractical choices, a theologian who care so much about the answer to the problem of evil she would rather ask god that than ask for a way of fixing the world that is currently undergoing an apocalypse, two revolutionary without a cause willing to do violence for poorly thought out reasons, an archangel that had to be explained social skills and basic moral reasoning by a little girl, an very young AI obsessed with her creator... anyway, combining all of their minds, I guess I don't trust things to sort themselves out.

  This story had a lot of fun elements, it was just uniquely disturbing at the same time, and I think I wasn't quite willing to suspend disbelief enough to trust that there was a theodicy or to trust Metatron's answer.  From failure to suspend disbelief, other details seem a lot worse or more disturbing.  For instance... why didn't they Comet King come up with the idea of using the telepathic connection to transfer knowledge of the Explicit name to people already in hell?  If one person can't use it, then he could find the right combination of hell bound people, connect them telepathically before they die, and then redeem them after they die and go to hell.  It makes the Comet King's wife's plan (or lack thereof) seem really stupid in comparison.
  ```

  - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
    ```
    The story said that in order to use the Explicit name, you need enough brainpower to understand Adam Kadmon. Which means only the Comet King and supercomputers with souls can say the Explicit name. I don't think the comet king or his wife knew about the telepathic connection name, and it's not known whether a supercomputer can enter hell. Thamiel and his demons certainly would be very puzzled about how to torment a supercomputer. 

    So yes, maybe there are better plans, but the Comet King and his wife didn't know about it.

      The Comet King, Uriel, Sohu, and Isaac Luria have all looked upon Adam Kadmon bare according to Ch.3

        Looked upon it. I think we have Sohu's POV as she sees it, and she is completely overwhelmed. Suppose one must fully comprehend the dizzying complexity that unfolds into the entire universe; Sohu is not equal to this task, but the Comet King, and THARMAS, are

    - u/None:

      The Comet King and his wife couldn't have done SCABMOM anyways---Uriel only created the ritual after TCK died. He might have actually created it *shortly before* he died, but TCK and Robin still couldn't have done it because Robin was already in Hell.

  So -- people who read through to the end of this, how was it? I made it something like 14 or 15 chapters in (reading as each chapter was released, about a year ago), and really enjoyed certain parts of it, but other parts found really boring -- specifically when (as I recall) it would go into these multiple paragraph spiels on how (e.g.) there are 26 letters in the modern English alphabet, which is twice the number of attendees at The Last Supper and also the product of two primes, signifying the immutable theistic dualism implicit in the aforementioned event, and if you convert "immutable theistic dualism" to hex the first two digits are 69, a popular sex position where two lovers pleasure each other symmetrically, just like the soul and the body under ideal circumstances, which is made further relevant in the relation 2^13 = 8,192, for 8192 is the precise length in KB of the program that governed the steering functions of the ship that in the 1969 lunar mission broke the firmament of being, demonstrating the conflict between humanity's scientific and spiritual progress, and the 8th, 1st, 9th, and 2nd letters in English spell HAIB, referring both to the Hawaii Association of International Buddhists and the Hudson Alpha Institute for Biotechnology, which represent the Soul and the Body, respectively, and HAIB is also an alternate, accented spelling of HEB, or the Epistle to the Hebrews, one of the major themes of which is the role of Jesus as mediator between Body and Soul, Etc. Etc. Etc.

  I generally quite liked the worldbuilding and magic and munchkinry (and found the characters to be decent and the writing quality above average), but all of the numerological "fundamental interconnectedness of all things" asides made my eyes glaze over. Just wasn't for me... so I decided to put it down until it finished and ask someone as to the balance of the former things to the latter.

  - u/Ninmesara:
    ```
    You might like to trad it now that it is complete. Now you won't feel guilty if you jump over the numerological parts. BUT do note that the munchikinry in the story is way more inconsistent than what you might expect and after book one the story veers into completely different territory.

    > So -- people who read through to the end of this, how was it?

    Ditto.

    I got up to the boat with the seven sails and it just got too much effort to push on through something that looked increasingly unlikely to have a payoff for the effort of ploughing though it.

    I really like the kind of worldbuilding and references and allusions in Unsong, but in smaller doses embedded in an actual story. I mean, even Robert Anton Wilson was willing to toss in a fish now and then.

- u/Fredlage:
  ```
  Well, now that it's over, my opinion on the story as whole:

  It was a very fun and clever story, the last time I'd cracked up so much was while reading The Seventh Horcrux and that was explicitly a crackfic. If someone had told my I'd like a story with such an abundance of puns I wouldn't have believed them. 

  The most impressive part were the incredibly convoluted coincidences Scott managed to bring up. I can hardly imagine how much research that took. 

  The various ideas in the story were very cool, from the brute forcing of magic words, the mechanics of placebomancy, and the drugs effects on reality. The angels were really interesting too.

  I also quite enjoyed Sohu and Uriel's story. Ana's and the Comet King's were good too.

  At this point however, we get to my criticism. One storyline I thought was mostly pointless was that of Boojum. I mean, sure, it ended up being important that Mark got Malia's blood, but that whole thread feels like it could have been replaced by something simpler without much being lost. I liked Malia's story and I wish we could have seen more of her, but the Boojum crowd mostly seemed to be there to react to Dylan's antics.

  And finally, another weak point was Aaron. I don't know if it was intentional, but mostly his role in the story is to be there while important things happen, being done by other people. He had a couple of moments of brilliance, like when he escaped from Unsong or when he used Aramaic against the Drug Lord, but mostly he was just there, moving from one place to another while somebody else did the stuff that actually mattered.

  On the whole, I quite liked it and I thank Scott for writing it.
  ```

      And this speech.

      > “Media outlets,” said Dylan “are supposed to tell you the state of the world. But they can only do so much. Yes, the newspapers can tell you that the health system is failing, that there aren’t enough scrolls with the Coagulant Name for everybody who needs them. They can give you all sorts of statistics, they can show you pictures of the corpses. All nice and well. But somehow, people just don’t seem to get the message. Something has been lost. The widow wailing because her husband bled to death after a car accident, she’s got something that the guy sitting in an armchair reading the paper hasn’t. The widow understands what a shortage of the Coagulant Name means, understands what it means when the guy in the suit says that we can’t lower the price or else it would ‘hurt innovation’. The guy in his armchair has been told, but he hasn’t understood. A failure of communication, you see? Everywhere people suffer, and the media tells people, but they don’t get it.

      > “I have always thought we can do better. That’s what we do here at BOOJUM Media, Ltd. You can talk about elephants all day long, but at some point if you want someone to understand you’ve got to take them to the zoo and throw them in the elephant cage. The only way to make people understand what it’s like to live in fear is to make them live in fear. The only way to make people understand what it’s like to suffer is to make them suffer. You can tell a Senator a thousand times that people are dying out there, but it’s not until the Senator’s colleague gets a letter-bomb that it sinks in. We’re not just a media outlet. We’re a boutique media oulet. We cater to the rich and famous, the elite. We give them a better class of service, the premium deal. The middle-class get to read about other people’s suffering in the newspapers. But the rich? They deserve better! They deserve to experience a little piece of it, to have all the conflicts of the world packaged neatly in brown paper and brought to them in their own living room. It’s the most elite media service in the world, and we do it all for free, all for the warm glow of knowing that we made a difference.”

Second, it would convince whoever wound up in the replacement government that it would be a *really good idea* to throw silly amounts of money at NASA.

      ```
      Agreed, practically every BOOJUM chapter was brilliant and hilarious, to me. I'll have to do a reread sometime to be sure, but right now those chapters might actually be the funnest of the story when all is said and done. Maybe tied with the Sohu+Uriel ones.
      ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    My problem with the series as a whole is that it's not always more than the sum of its parts. I felt that way about BOOJUM in particular; I liked the chapters, but they felt like they were a separate story that had been welded onto this one. (Many of the chapters are adapted into Unsong from previous things that Scott has written, so perhaps that's literally the case.)
    ```

    - u/Ninmesara:
      ```
      In general Unsong might suffer from trying to fit in as much plot/characters as possible. Scott has said somewhere that it's basically a collection of all the ideas he had for a story.

    - u/None:
      ```
      Yeah, I feel like the first few chapters were an urban fantasy style thing where kabbalah is real, but most other things remain the same, but by the end we were in a full on fantasy universe with a great cosmic conflict. Like we got the first half of one book and the second half of another. 

      Feels like Scott lost interst in Aaron's story so put more attention into the cometking/sohu/angels side, which was originally part of teh worldbuilding

    > I don't know if it was intentional, but mostly his role in the story is to be there while important things happen, being done by other people.

    I think Scott wrote something about the kabbalistic implications of Aaron's name somewhere, specifically 'Smith-Teller' and how it could be a reference to several different things, including that he's supposed to be a narrator rather than an actor. He also compared Teller with Singer and made a bunch of other inferences (it might have been on his tumblr?)

  I just found this story recently, and while the ride was entertaining, I found myself very unsatisfied with God's answer to Job in chapter 71. 

  I have always found "sacrifices for the greater good" to not be acts of good, but rather acts of desperation. People sacrifice for the greater good because as puny mortals, people see or have no better options, and fear that if they do not, the world will fall into ruins and everyone will suffer.

  To see the omniscient and omnipotent God of Unsong operating on the same logic is utterly terrifying, significantly more so because it could also be true in reality. And also incredibly disgusting, because Unsong's God explains that he gave Job tremendous suffering, not for reasons like saving the world, but for reasons like making a beautiful Leviathan.

  I don't think the garden of worlds metaphor properly describes how horrible this is, so let's try another. Imagine the multiverse is a computer, and each world is a picture. A JPG, BMP, PNG, or whatever. The Unsong God states that the Leviathan is a thing of beauty, so say we have a file Leviathan.JPG, which is a picture of the leviathan with a plain white background, i.e., a world that contains only the leviathan and nothing else. He could make two such worlds, but that's like just copying Leviathan.JPG, so now he has two copies of one picture, not two pictures. 

  So the Unsong God decides, let's make a new picture, LeviathanAndJob.JPG, which still has the Leviathan in the foreground, but behind it is Job, covered in boils and all other manner of suffering. That's a different picture, so now the Unsong God has two beautiful Leviathans. In essence, the Unsong God created Job and all his suffering to be the foil. The contrast for his picture. And considering all the discussion about minor permutations, the Unsong God probably has a full folder of distinct LeviathanAndStuff.JPGs, each with a different hellscape behind the Leviathan, just so he can have a bunch of beautiful Leviathans on his multiverse computer.

    ```
    And you know what the absolute worst part was? It was that after creating Job's world, and letting it run on for years, he then asks Job if he would like his whole world and all other sentient beings in it to be erased, just so Job wouldn't have boils. As if that would make everything better.

    There is a BIG, **BIG** difference between creating something and then destroying it, versus never creating that thing at all. It's like murdering all your fully grown adult children versus never losing your virginity in the first place. Let's try a different analogy to demonstrate how heinous this is. Imagine a world where the Comet King is unpopular. So when he asked for women to make Cometspawn, no one volunteered.

    And so, Comet King decides that, for the greater good, he should just sexually assault a bunch of women. So he does, resulting in lots of 
    traumatized women and beautiful Cometspawn. You know, the greater good (*sorta*). And at the end of it all, one of the few remaining women who still have their sanity/lives talks to him about why he inflicted such evils upon them, and the Comet King tells her: "Look at my beautiful spawn! Would you rather I kill them all and you as well? Just because you want to selfishly stop your own suffering?" 

    Because you know, that's totally the same as never assaulting her in the first place (*sarcasm*).

    The Comet King at least has a debatable excuse: Cometspawn are vital for fighting hell. The Unsong God's excuse is "Leviathans are pretty".

      Eh, this _really_ depends on your cosmology.

      If you're following something like [Tegmarkism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_universe_hypothesis) (also, ironically, [Beyond the Reach of God](http://lesswrong.com/lw/uk/beyond_the_reach_of_god/)), then the reality of a world depends purely on the mathematical law that describes it. As such, a God "creating" (computing, evaluating) it doesn't necessarily do anything at all - but it's also possible that there's a Tiplerian [Omega point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omega_Point) of complete self-observation at the end of the universe, which is necessary for that universe to be _"actually real"_. As such, God could offer Job to never have existed _and have that be a meaningful offer_ because the universe's reality depends on an ultimate point of observation rather than an ongoing act of creation. So there's room here, philosophically, for God's offer to be plausible.
      ```

      - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
        ```
        With regard to Tegmarkism, the Unsong God says he plants seeds, and uses his omniscience to see whether they are good. So the seed could be the math and laws of physics, after setting them the Unsong God stops interfering.

        However, even if he stops interfering from that point, that is a lot like starting a machine, seeing that it will brutally torture and kill countless people, and refusing to turn it off because it also produces a pretty leviathan. 

        With regard to Omega points, this is a bit of a gray area, but I still say it's evil. Here's a simpler thought experiment: suppose I have a time machine. I now go and brutally torture a random stranger, then use my time machine to travel back to before the torture session. Thus the torture session is not "actually real" (technically), since it never happened in this timeline and no one but me remembers it. Is this ethical? Would it be ethical if I wiped my own memories too?

        If it is ethical, then God would also be ethical in creating millions of hellscapes lasting for millions of years, in which he commits all kinds of horrible evils for sadistic joy, while promising that he will turn back time at the end so whatever unspeakable thing he's doing now isn't "real" evil.

  I'll be completely honest, I feel like the epilogue comes completely out of left field in a lot of ways and lacks the necessary setup to work properly.

    I thought it was beautiful. Honestly I thought the ending at the end of Ch 72 was perfect, but the epilogue added a nice extra touch of detail to it. I'm not sure what wasn't properly supported though? The only new idea that's introduced is the nature of Thamiel's withered head, everything else was set up in a previous chapter or a natural extension of the novel's themes.

    - u/DaystarEld:
      ```
      Besides the head thing, the idea that the kabbalistic marriage works that way wasn't foreshadowed at all, I don't think? It's a handy way of avoiding any of the dead characters we bonded with from "really dying," even for a little while, but there's no reason given as to why Aaron only noticed the other minds (or why they only spoke up) once everything was over and done with. Did it have something to do with the Comet King's actions in Hell "freeing" whoever went there? If that's the case, why were Sohu and Uriel there, even if we accept that Ana and Erica belonged there?
      ```

      - u/embrodski:
        ```
        I'm probably getting leakage from reading the comments, during which there was much speculation of the kaballistic marriage chaining, but the ability for the dead to live on in the heads of others was demonstrated by Uriel being in Sohu's head. It's only one chapter previous, but it was some ground work.

        It was completely foreshadowed.  Ana only knew about Malia's blood in Mark's locket because she had Erica and Dylan in her head.  There were a couple lines devoted specifically to the feeling she got thinking about them that implied they were dead.

        It had already been established that thoughts could be passed unconsciously with Sohu and the Vital Name.

        It was all but confirmed, finally, when Uriel tells Sohu about how he made SKABMOM, and what it did.  He specified that it would work even after death, even.  (Edit: and then we saw it in practice with Uriel and Sohu, of course.)

        While this was somewhat of a step beyond what had been shown previously, I think it was perfectly clear.  Many other readers in the comments (though I will admit that they are the sharpest of all of us) also came to these same conclusions.

          Right, but I took that as basically this:

          >It had already been established that thoughts could be passed unconsciously with Sohu and the Vital Name.

          Like, there's a difference between "we're bonded now and so my soul has residence in your head after I die" and "We're bonded now so we can talk from far distances, even from the afterlife." It really should have come up when we were with Ana, after Erica died: it was intentionally vague as to how she knew what she knew, and it irks me a little that Erica didn't just go "Oh, hey, I guess I'm in your head now, that's weird huh?"

      I'm not as good a writer as Scott, so I'm sure he could do a better job given enough time & space to work with, but I'd have enjoyed this more if there were some setup about who can speak the Shem HaMephorash & why, what exactly it means to 'fix hell', why all the people in Aaron's head don't show up earlier, and so on. It all feels like there's a few important pieces of supporting worldbuilding that are missing.

      The reactions of everyone to merging into a single entity are also... lacking, to say the least. I find it hard to believe Dylan, for example, wouldn't try to either take charge, kick up a huge fuss, or otherwise manipulate or exert control on things. There's also much less shock and outright horror at impending nonexistence from pretty much everyone (except maybe Uriel).

      Like, I don't want to bash on the epilogue that much. It's not outright bad, but it's not at the same level as the rest of UNSONG.

  So was thamiel evil for the greater good or something? What happened to him at the end? Is he dead?
  ```

  - u/thefuckisup:
    ```
    Thamiel was the vast joke that no one would have believed was real given enough information. He wasn't necessary, per se, he was more like the evil that would eventually inspire good into being, by virtue of simply following his course. He put on the act of evil being par for the course of the world(am i using the idiom right?) while knowing that it was not, that it was an illusion mantained by people that didn't know better. He played the devil because it was what he would do if he wasn't self aware of it. Because he is self aware, he does it anyway, because he knows this is what he "needs" to do.
    ```

- u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
  ```
  Actually, after reading the epilogue again, I'm kinda confused by what happened. It felt like the epilogue chapter just had the words "Happy End" on it without any specific information, because they simply spoke the world-remaking word.

  How exactly does that solve the problem of evil specifically? Thamiel may have been faking evil, but I doubt the rest of the denizens of hell were. What happens to them? Just erased and put out of their misery? Freed from hell only to have to live with their traumas and horrible suspicions that this is just another "hope trap" by the torture experts of hell? 

  And what of that little boy who came up with countless methods of perverse and horrific torture methods to use on his mother, and actually used them? Even if he's freed from hell, doesn't he still have to live with the memory and guilt of it? How would he interact with other people now that they all fear and revile him for his evils? How would he interact with the mother he tortured for millenniums? What specifically happened in the end to give him salvation?
  ```

  - u/gwern:
    ```
    The denizens of hell get to live in a hell transformed to heaven. Since death has metaphysical importance and hell is not a place on the normal plane of existence, they presumably stay there but aren't erased. The joy of living there eventually outweighs their tortures, and no one is tortured in the future, so the universe will become net good and justify its existence as part of the net-good multiverse. They may be suspicious initially but the Broadcast establishes that the false-hope always is yanked away quickly - the demons don't *need* to stretch it out to be convincing because the damned are so desperate and are suckers. If anything, that implies that they will immediately believe in the Comet King's changes (because they're suckers, but this time they're right). They may have memories and regrets, but they can forgive each other because they know each of them has or would have done things just as bad; also, transcendent joy and infinite love.
    ```

      ```
      > The joy of living there eventually outweighs their tortures,

      I'm highly skeptical of these, but fine, let's accept these assumptions.

      > They may have memories and regrets, but they can forgive each other because they know each of them has or would have done things just as bad; 

      Actually, being in hell is precisely what would show that this is false. Everyone is being tortured, but Thamiel claims that some of them come up with plans so horrifying that even the demons are repulsed. Which seems pretty plausible, since different people have different erm... creativity? (euphemism) 

      So while most people may resort to murdering one another, some will go to the most cruel and unspeakable lengths when ordered, and others still would come up with far, far worse methods than suggested. And so the rest would forever know, that these are the people who would commit evils so vile that no one else ever would.

        > I'm highly skeptical of these, but fine, let's accept these assumptions.

        Why would you be skeptical? An entire chapter is set in SF with transcendent joy and infinite love, and the outweighing follows directly from the theodicy.

        And some people are more athletic and others are smarter and whatnot. Why would being a little more creative matter at all compared to *infinite* love and *transcendent* joy?

          An entire chapter in SF showing people being brainwashed into professing infinite love and transcendent wisdom by LSD, and the rest of the world being so terrified that they have built a blockade around SF, and Metatron himself having to come running to save Erica from the infinite love of LSD?  And of Neil Armstrong tricking unwilling people into having his "infinite love" in a way that's eerily similar to how the Ziggurat-maniac drug lord formed his Peyote slaves? Yes, that is exactly why I'm skeptical.

          >And some people are more athletic and others are smarter and whatnot. Why would being a little more creative matter at all 

          It was a euphemism for unspeakable amounts of evil orders of magnitude more than the average person. It's not a "little" more. We're talking about things so horrible that they weren't shown in the torture broadcast, because even the demons were repulsed. Things so utterly unforgivable, that you gotta be like pumped full of LSD to even consi- Oh.

          Well I suppose if the whole world was so high that they don't care about anything, anything is forgivable.

          > (Seriously, of all the criticisms of Unsong so far...)

          My criticism here is that these issues were never addressed. Apart from Thamiel going "PUNK'D! I WAS GOOD THIS WHOLE TIME!", we got pretty much no information about what happened to the people in hell.

          Hell was basically the main point of everything in the story: the moment hell was discovered, all the utilitarians dropped everything to save people in hell. Starving people in africa? Dying people in hospitals? Screw them, UNSONG it up to fight hell! Yet in the end we aren't told anything about what happened to the people in hell, other than the Comet King saying the explicit name, and even that wasn't explicitly stated, just Aaron's best guess of what would happen.

  This is a universe that exists in UNSONG.

  - u/eltegid:
    ```
    "A simple example would be that 11/24 hours you spend in Hell, and 13/24 hours you spend in Heaven"
    That is not true: the proportion is whatever it needs to be to be juust acceptable. For instance, it may be that you need 20 hours of Heaven to outweigh 4 hours of Hell.

    And actually, it may be that any 'just right' equilibrium is just not acceptable: in the universe we are seeing, there has been a finite time in which there was a Hell, and there is (presumably) an infinite time into the future in which the universe will be unquestionably good-optimized. And this is one of the worst universes possible.
    So maybe the utility function is such that the only 'net good' acceptable is an infinite good of a higher order than whatever evil (infinite or finite) you have.
    ```

      ```
      Ohh, that's (higher order infinite) pretty good. Otherwise it's too easy to game the system.

- u/None:
  ```
  So I think a fairly obvious takeaway is that Thamiel didn't actually enjoy being evil, he was just placed there to do it by God. His role as God's left hand is to be the root of all Evil; God creates Good which is perfection, and then places Thamiel in all these Universes so that he can act to create Evil. He doesn't enjoy doing it, but he has to.

  “So many centuries,” it pled. “So much misery, so many tears, so many years of suffering. You couldn’t imagine it, nobody could imagine it, but I did what God wanted, I did my duty, but you have to tell me, please, at the end of everything, did I do good?”

  Anyone else think this parallels The Comet King really well? Having to become evil despite your own nature, putting on a disguise (Thamiel not showing his true self, TCK becoming TOK), having sex with Robin West, and being killed by your own weapon in the end so the world can be changed with the haMephorash.
