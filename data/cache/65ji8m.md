## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  Your daydreams are now 100% accurate, meaning that if you imagine yourself doing something, how you imagine everyone and everything reacts is exactly the same as how they would react in real life.

  RULES:

  * These daydreams must always begin at your current moment.

  * Time passes at a 1:1 rate; if you want to do something on the other side of the world, you have to keep daydreaming for the whole 13-hour flight; stopping the daydream will cause you to restart back where you are in real life.

  * Your senses in the daydream are no greater than those in real life.

  * If you die in the daydream, nothing happens; it just ends.

  How do you take advantage of this power?

    This is almost as powerful as Coil's power for the purposes of information gathering. Depending on your morals, lead-pipe legilimancy yields all the passwords you need.

    I shall assume that we don't see ending a daydream as killing everyone in it. (Other people within the daydream may disagree, of course.)

    An easy tactic to use this power for great good is to daydream going public with your power on, say, reddit, and asking people for a way to prove it to them on the next daydream using, say, a PGP-signed message from other people to themselves saying that it originated inside what was claimed to be a daydream. The public could then spend all its ressources immediately on acquiring knowledge and give it to me to (anonymously?) make public. This would be dangerous as this might leak the existence of this power - for all I know, someone is holding back a piece of research right now with a prepared channel of steganography for just such an occasion. Note that if I can resist being convinced to go public for real, this puts the brainpower of the entire world behind thinking up more ideas for me without myself having actually gone public.

    An easy way to make money is to mine bitcoins using proof-of-work stolen from daydreams. Not sure how to do it without possibly attracting attention.

    Physicists might be highly interested in the effect of chaos theory on quantum random number generators on the other side of the planet within less/more time after the divergence point than light would take to reach them.

    Great care must be taken with this power after anyone has the ability to release an AGI, given their ability to break out of such boxes. Using it continuously then halves the time we have left in the worst case, even without doing anything different in the daydream.

    Edit: What happens to a Schroedinger's cat if you look in the box in a daydream? If its state collapses, anyone with a quantum computer might send messages out of a dream, so be careful with going public even in a dream. If it doesn't, I'm not sure how exactly, but quantum computers should be more powerful in your hands.

    Hmmm... I can glance over a scratchcard for a lottery - the sort where you scratch it off to see whether or not you can win anything - and decide after a brief daydream whether or not it's worth the price with no actual risk taken.

    I can daydream my way into cheap but relaxing holidays, and daydream my way through free entertainment. (For example, I could daydream my way through watching a movie and conveniently wake up back home without having to pay for the ticket).

    I can become an untraceable spy - daydreaming my way through breaking (inexpertly) into a room and carefully reading through secret documents, only to wake up with the real documents undisturbed and thus no evidence left as to how that info got into my head.

    I can become a useful risk-free test pilot - once I learn how to fly a plane (perhaps daydreaming my way through the lessons?) I can sit in the cockpit of a newly designed plane for a couple of hours then wake up and tell the engineers what *really* needs to be fixed *now*. (This will require demonstrating my powers to said engineers).
    ```

  - u/ArgentStonecutter:

    You are now pretty much Coil from [Worm](/r/parahumans), except that one of the forks is "sitting there daydreaming" and that's the one you go back to.

  - u/InfernoVulpix:
    ```
    Time passes at a 1:1 rate *within* the daydream, but what's it like outside?  If I'm on a train ride and make a daydream, like an impromptu dance party on the train, that lasts until I get off the train, will I wake up at my destination or only a few minutes/seconds/instantly after starting to daydream?

    If it's 1:1 with outside time as well, then assuming I'm physically in a 'daydream state' of being generally silent and zoned out, using the power in any social context is all but impossible.  I'd have to find a good place to zone out and at least a few minutes for any good social use of it.  I can't use it to 'get right' many things because many things are time sensitive and I'd have to daydream through the event to simulate it.

    However, while in a daydream I happen to have an interesting trait found commonly in time loop stories, the complete and utter absence of consequences.  I can take a gun and run through the streets shooting it wildly and, in the real world, suffer nothing from it.  Were I entirely unscrupulous, I could take at least a knife or something, and torture people for info I wanted.  Need to ace a test?  Wave a knife at the teacher and demand the answers (during the lunch hour when I can be zoned out reasonably).  Want to know if someone's hiding something?  Point a gun at their head and demand an explanation.

    For a less ethically compromising variant, it gives a good skillset for investigation of all varieties.  Approach the area ahead of time in a daydream, note failure points, and use that to make the real deal more successful.  Of course, you can *also* combine that with pointing guns at people's heads and demanding answers, if you can convince yourself to do it.

    The last real trick is going public with the power, or at least that I have *a* power.  For controlled tests, I can ask a tester to write down a different thing on two separate pieces of paper, and conceal them however they like.  Then, I will ask to read one paper and tell them what's in the other.  Once the papers are concealed, I daydream asking for paper A, read it, then wake up and ask for paper B, reporting on what's on paper A.  A single-paper version of this experiment would have a challenge in that in the daydream I'd have to convince them to let me read the paper despite that invalidating the experiment, but a double-paper setup sidesteps that.

  You are a glowing patch of green that contaminates every solid surface it touches that's coarser than sand. You have audiovisual input/output across all of your area and your goal is to get all over the place. Start as a square centimetre of your choice.
  ```

  - u/xamueljones:
    ```
    Start in Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport which is the busiest international airport in the world as a random patch on the floor. Copy myself onto multiple individuals' shoes, but only at the rate of one out of 25 shoes or so, so I don't replicate *too* quickly and raise suspicions. By the time anyone notices multiple copies of myself, I will have seeded myself all over the world!

    Note that all replications are from floor to shoe or shoe to floor. No growing any patches. It's more important to have many tiny copies of myself than it is to have fewer, but larger, copies.
    ```

    - u/Gurkenglas:
      ```
      You don't choose whether you contaminate.
      ```

      - u/xamueljones:
        ```
        So do I have control over anything other than where I start?
        ```

        - u/Gurkenglas:
          ```
          You have audiovisual output. (That means your area acts as a screen, except any image is green-tinged and glowing, and you can generate any sound you can imagine up to, say, the maximum volume of a normal loudspeaker.)
          ```

          - u/ZeroNihilist:
            ```
            1. Do disconnected patches share their consciousness/memories/etc.?
            2. Does mental processing power scale with area?

            If 2, it seems like you could pass yourself off as a novelty mirror or the like. Just reflect what you see, maybe putting a spin on it à la Snapchat filters if the user wants it. You could also copy the appearance and sound of anyone you'd seen and heard, e.g. to mock an enemy for the amusement of the "owner".

            It wouldn't be too expensive to make an additional device to convert your green-tinged output to true colour (unless your output is strictly limited to the visual spectrum, in which case you'd introduce some noise in the process), so long as the patch has the processing power to perform that conversion. You could, of course, explain the process to any entrepeneurs that happened upon you and felt like becoming filthy rich

            If 1 also, you could effectively market yourself as ultra-fast internet that can be put on countless easily made surfaces. Chat with somebody on the other side of the world for free, act as a bug (the spying tool) or security camera, etc.

            If 1 but not 2, you're going to quickly run into a problem with any approach like this. If neither 1 nor 2, your usefulness is limited but not negated.

            In terms of starting position, anywhere that people are likely to notice you and not immediately attempt to scour you is good. The best option for a human-centric strategy is going to be starting near a curious human, preferably one who would like to show you to the world (for the sake of knowledge, money, or humour; it doesn't matter).
            ```

            - u/Gurkenglas:
              ```
              1. Yes. ("You have audiovisual input/output across all of your area")
              2. I put off that question until someone cared... let's grant you Taylor-level multitasking.

              If such a device is possible, you'll be able to modulate the hues of green such that the device works given some time to practice in front of a mirror.
              ```

    Well since you can't choose whether to contaminate something the best bet is to simply pick some bedrock nearly anywhere on earth. You will immediately spread to the entire continental crust, then to the oceanic crust and pretty much all of the earth's crust.             
    The ability to spread to any connected solid surface that's coarser than sand is _incredibly_ powerful, since once you get very deep pretty much all the earth's crust is connected by solid material coarser than sand.

    So yeah you pretty much instantly spread to the entire earth's crust, with the exception of much of the surface where things are covered by soil, sand and the like. Still people definitely notice that every mountain or any area of rock or gravel that connects to bedrock indirectly suddenly becomes green.        
    Right from the get go nobody's going to stop you and all buildings with remotely deep foundations are also green, which extends to all connected concrete (thus including nearly all roads).            
    Most trees are probably also affected if their roots go deep enough to reach coarse soil, and well it seems like a great amount of the population and many animals are immediately green.
    ```

  - u/CitrusJ:
    ```
    Why are you a glowing green patch if you can control audiovisual output? You can just be invisible by outputting whatever is beneath you/was there before. Sounds pretty easy to spread everywhere then

  Congratulations, you've been selected to beta test the new Deluxe reincarnation package! Henceforth, when you die, you will retain your consciousness as well as your soul into your new life.

  RULES:

  * Your consciousness includes your memories, beliefs, values, continuity of subjective experience, and so forth.  
  * The deal does not specify what is meant by your "soul", but it's implied that it's not new, and that reincarnation has already been occuring naturally; this is just an upgrade to what would've happened anyway.  
  * For our purposes, "death" refers to the cessation of all coördinated biological functions. If you become a vegetable, you can't reincarnate until someone pulls the plug.  
  * There's a magical no-cloning theory at play. Once you reincarnate, any information left in your old brain is irrevokably scrambled.  
  * No one's brainstates are overwritten; your new body is selected at conception, and your consciousness is gradually transfered to your new brain as it develops.  
  * Only bodies of the same species are eligible candidates. This is determined based on the body you're leaving, not your "original" body, so you don't have to worry about the human species evolving into incompatibility.  
  * Your biological development is not affected. Good luck doing anything useful for at least a couple years.  
  * Of course, the transfer can't happen any faster than light speed.  
  * Your new body is selected so as to minimize this travel time.  
  * In ordinary circumstances, this just means the next available body, but may in extreme cases involve waiting briefly for one to show up closer.  
  * The above only applies if the body's appearance could in principle be predicted based on the current state of the universe. No shenanigans with prime numbers and petri dishes at the ready.  
  * You're not the only one with this ability; an unspecified but small fraction of humanity is participating in the trial along with you.  
  * If all goes well, this will be rolled out for all of humanity, either as the standard form of reincarnation or as a perk for good karma.

    What happens if I get brain damaged/acquire Alzheimer's first? What about other mental illnesses that transform me enough that the old me might as well be dead, but I have become another human that will want to stay alive?

    The trial participants will want the public to organize reincarnation, providing bodies and a reintegration highway.

    How does this combine with designer babies? Does selecting for higher IQ get overwritten by my brainstate?
    ```

    - u/Nulono:
      ```
      For these purposes, consider the physical brain as more of a tool that the soul uses to carry out consciousness. So a physiological loss of brain functioning would be akin to some kind of hardware desync that can be fixed with a hard reboot, or whatever the appropriate computer term would be.
      ```

  - u/CCC_037:
    ```
    This does nothing for me until I die, an outcome still to be put off as long as possible (I'd end up in a messily uncoordinated body without any of my current support structures). It does mean that my next body gains a substantial advantage in already having a complete education at the age of two (but I'll probably have to re-learn things like how to talk).

    ...those first two years are going to be one long embarrassing moment.
    ```

    - u/Nulono:
      ```
      > It does mean that my next body gains a substantial advantage in already having a complete education at the age of two

      What would be the best way to leverage this advantage?
      ```

      - u/CCC_037:
        ```
        ...I could purchase some long-term investments, leave them in my will to whoever turns up with the password. I'd be a couple of years out of date by the time I get my new body under control (and I might now be a different gender for extra awkwardness) but I'd still be able to write software and even maintain a contiguous online identity with occasional long breaks.

        I'm not sure I see any exploits that couldn't also be pulled off with mere (!!!) immortality.
        ```
