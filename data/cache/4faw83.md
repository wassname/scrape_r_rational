  New chapter of Legacy (Worm fanfiction). Cenotaph and Wake precede Legacy, read them before starting on Legacy if you haven't yet.
  ```

    How is Legacy? The writing in Cenotaph and Wake was almost comparable to that of Worm. But I thought I'd leave Legacy hanging until it's ready.

      Equally excellent, albeit different in theme - Legacy is about rebuilding the entire city, and maybe Taylor's disconnection from normality.  Less fights, more politics; but brilliantly written.
      ```

    - u/JEerola:
      ```
      Well, I think it's really good. There's maybe less fighting so far, but it feels like events are getting a bit more intense.

  ```
  Yeah, saw it. Took me a while to remember which fic it was, since I'm following like 10 other Worm fics.

    Finding out about Space Battles and Sufficient Velocity was the best/worst day of my life

        It's pretty unfortunate, there's [ficsave](https://ficsave.com/) (which is great for Fanfiction), and a couple others that work sporadically on other sites, but I still haven't found anything that works on Spacebattles or Sufficient Velocity.

        Meanwhile, the [20-20](http://lifehacker.com/5591835/reduce-computer-caused-eye-strain-with-the-20-20-20-rule) rule and taking frequent breaks were lifesavers once I learned about them.

          This isn't exactly super user friendly, but... [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/jmgwmqgh939dco0/SB-SV-QQ-ETC%20EBOOKFAB.zip?dl=0). It is a bit jury rigged but it is something I made to get stories off SB/SV/QQ and onto my kindle. It does require using the command line and installing Node.js though.
          ```

          - u/whywhisperwhy:
            ```
            So far downloaded node.js and tried to run epubgen.exe, but there's no prompts for a URL, documentation on what to do next, etc. Is this something a few simple commands are enough for?

            Thanks for sharing, but unfortunately I'm not familiar with javascript to dig into this without direction.
            ```

            - u/klassekatze:
              ```
              Shift right click in the folder and click "Open command window here"
              Run the command "node dl2ci_legacy-worm.js"
              That should do it. epubgen.exe is used by the script, it isn't used directly.
              ```

          - u/Gigapode:
            ```
            Tried the calibre addon fanfiction downloader? works for creating ebook files from SB, SV etc. I've also found bloxp useful for creating files from stories on blog sites like wordpress.
            ```

  ```
  Oh oh oh oh I have been waiting so long for this I am reading this right now and nothing short of a fire will stop me.
