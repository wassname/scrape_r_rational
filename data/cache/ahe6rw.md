## Looking for a specific young adult fantasy novel(s) with a reasonable rational villiab.

### Post:

Hi!

To frame the setting it was a fantasy world. The main characters were a youngish teen male and a similarly aged female. They were both from our world mysteriously transported to this fantasy world. In this world the villain was a magician of particular talent (though magic seemed pretty sparse) that was the dictator of the country or world. The main characters were sent on a quest to find the name? of the villain which was his only weakness. The fragments of the name were scattered and once said would be erased from the speaker's mind.


From what I remember a few of the rational things the villain did were as followed.


1. Had a very luxurious prison/hotel that any particularly successful rebel would be invited to live in for the rest of their life.

2. Let a previous hero who "almost" killed him live but blinded to attract possible dissidents.

3. His secret weakness wasn't actually his but a previous rival/teachers.

Other memorable things.

1. The hero played baseball and in a challenge where he chose the means of a fight chose to pelt each other with billiard balls.

2. The female came to the world through a stone pillar.

Thanks for the help!

  I vaguely remember reading a book like that. I think it was written by the same author as Fablehaven? 

  Looking at his website, I'm pretty sure you're looking for Beyonders.

  I enjoyed Beyonders. I disagree that the actions the villain took were rational, they were more pseudo-rational where they worked because the author wanted them to work, not because they were actually good ideas.

  1 and 2 would just inspire more rebellion. Creating a luxurious hotel would make more people want to rebel to get a shot at it, and letting the previous hero live also would just create more dissidence.

  3. was actually a pretty good idea though.

    He still had normal dictator-y law enforcement for the vast majority of people, only his greatest enemies got an invitation.

  It's interesting the things we remember about books. I read the at least two of these but don't really recall these details. Other things stand out to me, instead
