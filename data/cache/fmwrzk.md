  After a more than two year hiatus, Sideways in Hyperspace returns.
  For new readers, here is the [first chapter](https://sidewaysfiction.wordpress.com/2016/08/23/kicking-starward/), and here is the [index](https://sidewaysfiction.wordpress.com/). Returning readers can find the previous chapter [here](https://sidewaysfiction.wordpress.com/2017/12/17/the-island-of-misfit-toys/). 

  I'm also in the process of re-editing my older chapters to improve grammar and remove errors. My goal is to have a product for y'all that's polished to a mirror shine. 

  I'd like to offer my sincere apologies to my readers for vanishing for so long. My life got very hectic for a while and I wasn't able to dedicate the time I needed to provide the level of content quality I strive for. I hope you can forgive me. As of this today, I'll be resuming weekly posting with Sideways In Hyperspace: Arc IV, Maginot Games. My buffer is well stocked and there's a lot of great stuff in the pipeline.  

  As always, if you like what you've read you can support me on [patreon](https://www.patreon.com/Hivewired) or vote for Sideways in Hyperspace on [top web fiction](http://topwebfiction.com/vote.php?for=sideways-in-hyperspace). I also have a nonfiction blog where I talk about all sorts of things, you can find the link to that [here](https://hivewired.wordpress.com/).

    I'm sorry to hear that you were going through that & most importantly I'm glad you've made it out ok on the other side - this was a fantastic story to follow and I'm super happy to see more of it but your welfare definitely comes first.

      [Well here's the thing,](https://hivewired.wordpress.com/2020/03/06/even-if-your-voice-shakes/) I'm really not actually out the other side. However the current situation, while crappy, has given me a lot of time to write. So pros and cons.

    Do you happen to have a quick overview of something like "the story so far"? I remember reading it previously and liking the story, but don't remember all of the highlights of what has happened thus far.

    If not, no worries, ill likely eventually get around to rereading the old chapters.
