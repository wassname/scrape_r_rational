  I thought about posting this here, but decided against it because it's not fictional. A fun fact: this is the first time for quite some time that [MIRI is not doing donation matching.](https://intelligence.org/2015/07/01/grants-fundraisers/) Apparently they want to instead put focus on exciting projects they could run with sufficient funding.

  I personally feel very excited of how well MIRI's mission is going at the moment, they seem to have a lot of momentum. They also seem to be getting better and better at doing research that's possible to take seriously. Nate Soare's article [An Astounding Year](https://intelligence.org/2015/07/16/an-astounding-year/) made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside. Maybe we do have some hope.

    Now you're just deliberately setting yourself up for witty retorts.
