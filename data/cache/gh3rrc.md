  I'm pretty sure that the description of a ring environment spin-down as a big deal is incorrect. Two points of analysis:

  First, in the occupant's reference frame, the tangential and centripetal acceleration vectors would add. Since the magnitude goes as sqrt(x^(2)\+y^(2)), the change in total imitation gravity would be imperceptible for all reasonable spindown times. (You will not feel heavier.)  
  This leaves only an change in the direction, which, ignoring the effects of point two (to follow), would be indistinguishable from the floor tilting and the direction of gravity staying constant, a situation I'm confident is not too stressful, having stood on hills to no ill effect.

  This "tilt" of the floor is worse for large habitats: a 10km radius environment probably shouldn't be spun down in less than 10 minutes, since that makes the floor tilt at about 3 degrees... A 1km environment tilts 1°; angle is roughly proportional to sqrt(r)/t. (Note that these are initial tilts. As the rate of spin goes to zero, the tilt angle goes to 90°. Shouldn't matter too much.)

  The second concern would be that you notice the room stop spinning. Without looking up the sensitivity of the inner ear to acceleration, I estimated with a simple experiment: spinning in place, then stopping and seeing how long it took for the room to spin 63% (1-e^(-1)) as fast as when I first stopped and how long before everything felt totally normal again. (I guessed 4s and 35s, omega initial 2 rad/s) This should produce an upper bound on acceleration sensitivity, which I calculated as 8E-5 rad/s^(2). (If your characters have bionic super-ears, they should be able to ask for a few minutes of comforting lies... "no, your frame of reference is *quite stationary*".)

  This is worse in small structures, which have to spin at a higher RPM to make the same gravity. 8E-5 rad/s^(2) means that you can't *even tell*, other than the floor tilting *very* slightly (and gravity going away), if a 1km radius ring spins down over 20 minutes. (a 10km ring could be spun down in about 7 minutes, since this goes as sqrt(r), but the floor would go a bit sideways (4°)
