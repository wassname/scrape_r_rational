  I [updated Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/posts/updated-tiers-18971477) with tiers and goals, most notably 24-hour early release and [setting up a Discord](https://discord.gg/8MdWg2r); special thanks to my wife for helping with things that I didn't want to spend my own time on, but which probably are necessary steps towards full-time authorship that should be done now, rather than later.

  [Read after you've gotten to the end of this batch:](#s "Sorry for the moderate cliffhanger, I blame the planning fallacy.")

    Do you not write full time currently? Any tips on how to achieve your speed and quality?
    ```

    - u/cthulhuraejepsen:
      ```
      I'm currently a stay-at-home dad, so writing mostly happens after my son goes to bed, or occasionally when he's taking his afternoon nap (if I don't need to take a nap with him, which I often do). The economic question is sort of whether I can justify writing full-time once he's in kindergarten, or whether it will be part-time work and part-time writing, or just working full-time (probably as a software engineer, which is what I did before).

      As for writing, the first thing I'd suggest is that you spend a lot of time writing, and a lot of time *thinking* about writing. That naturally has to be combined with reading so that you can see how other people write, and pick up as many of their good habits as you can. Writing is a muscle, and you have to build it up, mostly by pushing yourself in different directions and putting in the effort. I was always pretty fast though, and I think if it were easy to be in the top 1% of writers by speed, more people would do it.

      Also, I co-host a podcast that's mostly about writing and fiction with Daystar Eld, Rationally Writing, which you can find [here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/rationally-writing/id1130741502?mt=2) or [here](http://daystareld.com/podcasts/rationally-writing/), so that's about forty hours of me talking about the writing process (though we unfortunately don't have transcripts).
      ```

        For anyone who missed it the most recent episode is an interveiw with /u/cthulhuraejepsen talking about the thought process behind WTC, which was really excellent http://daystareld.com/podcast/rationally-writing-42/
        ```

        - u/cthulhuraejepsen:
          ```
          Also probably of interest is [the episode on the intersection of tabletop RPGs and writing](http://daystareld.com/podcast/rationally-writing-26/), for obvious reasons (recorded before I started writing this particular story).
          ```

      - u/eroticas:
        ```
        Yeah I've been meaning to listen to those! I haven't because the lack of transcript means consuming at listening speed rather than reading speed, if someone is willing to transcribe I'm sure I'm not the only person who'd be more likely to access it.

        In between sleeping times doesn't seem like you have a lot of time. How many hours a day would you say you spend writing?
        ```

        - u/cthulhuraejepsen:
          ```
          Between two and six hours, though there are occasional days that I don't write, or I write something that's not *Worth the Candle*. Six hours of writing essentially means that I'm using absolutely all my free time for the day *and* staying up later than I should, which happens sometimes if I'm in a groove or really itching to get some specific scene or moment on the page. (I have a bad habit of sacrificing sleep.)

  > “Perhaps,” said Amaryllis. “The argument,” she grunted again, adding in a little bit of lunge that saw her without any handholds for a fraction of a second, “Is that whatever chance there was for a fruitful partnership between us, we acted in such a way that it could never happen.” She glanced at the handholds. “And at the end of it, we suffered some enormous expenses to kill one of the most proficient soul mages in the entire world. Given that he was in prison when we found him, it really wasn’t worth it.”

  The thing that weirds me out about that arc, that they are never discussing, is that Fallatehr (or someone close to him) betrayed them first, when he sent them a void grenade before they even had a chance to talk.

  We still don't know for sure whether it was him or one of his brainwashed minions who did it, but either way, it reflects pretty abysmally on him, and it makes aggressive mistrust a pretty rational choice.

  But it's weird because it never comes up. Nobody tells Fallatehr "How can we trust you when you already had one of us killed in cold blood!", and when they discuss whether they should trust him / have trusted him, they focus on the potential of soul magic and not the fact that, hey, he already murdered one of them without provocation.
  ```

  - u/Makin-:
    ```
    In Fallatehr's defense, it was likely they were there to kill him, so responding with a grenade is more misguided self defense or paranoia than a betrayal.
    ```

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    And after they did let him out, he took the first opportunity to subvert a party member, lied about it and made Valencia do the same. Then he later used Grak to trap and likewise subvert Amaryllis, while arranging for Juniper to lose his essentialism skills so he couldn't resist being subverted in turn. His endgame would basically be that the whole party becomes Fallatehr worshippers, or maybe they all become Fallatehr.

    And throughout all of this, they tried to take precautions, but I don't recall them ever betraying him.

    What more were they supposed to do?
    ```

    - u/CouteauBleu:
      ```
      They conspicuously arranged for his thralls to die during the prison escape (or at least, very visibly made zero effort to save them).

      They also made it very clear (implicitly) that they were only going to keep him around as long as they needed to, and that they would kill him after that.

      The situation Fallatehr was in was the same Joon and Fenn were at the zombie city: even though Fireteam Blackheart did not explicitly betray Joon at any point, they placed a death collar on him and their behavior made it clear that Joon would not outlive his usefulness, same for Fenn. 

      Again, it can be justified by the grenade thing, which is why I'm surprised they never mention it again. Without the grenade, Grak's point ("Is that whatever chance there was for a fruitful partnership between us, we acted in such a way that it could never happen") makes way more sense.

  - u/cthulhuraejepsen:
    ```
    Yeah, it's ~32K words, which is more than I would typically like in one go, but I try to make the chapter dumps follow logical transition points in the story (above and beyond the transition points that differentiate chapters). I think it helps make the thing read better, as well as helps me ensure that relatively atomic chunks of story are internally well-put-together.

    - u/Fresh_C:
      ```
      Thanks for doing things this way. I really prefer reading stories in finished arcs as opposed to waiting for each chapter to complete.

      When you release them this way, it makes it much easier to know when the story has reached a point that I'll be satisfied when I stop reading.

      How much did you write daily on average this month?
      ```

      - u/cthulhuraejepsen:
        ```
        In terms of time or word count?

        Word count actually gets entered into a spreadsheet, and it's currently ~1,890 words per day for the month (higher, if you include work on stories other than this one). 

        Time is a little harder to figure out, but usually a minimum of two hours a day, and a maximum of six, though I'm often doing other things while writing. If it's an average of four hours a day, then I guess that would be close to a hundred hours, but a lot of that time is spent with split focus (e.g. trying to sneak in some writing while my son is playing with his trucks, or going back and forth between writing and breaks on reddit or Youtube). There's probably some kind of productivity tracker I could use, but I try not to sweat that stuff too much, because getting in a "I have to write X words over Y hours" mindset isn't great creatively, at least for me.

      Eh. If Ropey is sentient the same way that the house was, then he simply wants to be put to good use as a rope, which is exactly what Joon does. I presume he's happy with his life.
      ```

      - u/thrawnca:
        ```
        I'm not sure what wants or needs Ropey might have. The usual food, clothing, and shelter don't apply. He spends plenty of time with people, and could easily start conversations if he wanted to - so presumably socialisation, at least with humans, isn't important to him. His bodily integrity isn't threatened; the party wouldn't willingly damage him any more than anyone else sentient.

        Overall, it seems unlikely that he has unvoiced complaints.
        ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    I'm really curious what his high seed writing was saying, does that imply Ropey is fully human level sapient? There's a whole personality in there we haven't heard from

        Just because he can make rope characters faster than human eyes can interpret doesn't necessarily mean he can think faster.

        Like if there was a computer screen transcribing what I said aloud, but only showing one character at a time, it'd be pretty hard to follow.

  - u/xartab:
    ```
    After reading that I felt the urge to punch something repeatedly, and I'm a little put out that Joon didn't. In fact his emotional response to the whole thing seems a bit weak.

    Also, Fenn reading his response while in the HTC could've been a fine time to one\-up her loyalty.

    > If you ask me, and I know that you would if you could, I think maybe this is some fallout from when she took away from her love of you.

    I’m never sure with this phrase. One has love *for* someone, as in, if A loves B, then A contains love directed at B. *Of* is in my comprehension far more ambiguous. If we say “The love of A for B” it’s clearly A’s love, but remove the *for* and say something like “The love of A of B” would reasonably parse as A’s love for B, but could also be read as the love for A by B. There’s… ambiguity. In that vein, “she took away from her love of you.” would reasonably be read as “Amy took away from Amy’s love for Joon.” Given the pliability of emotions by soulfuckery, though, it could *also* be read as “Amy took away from Joon’s love for Amy.”

    I know I’m probably making mountains of molehills here, but I like biuniqueness, especially in communication, even if it’s tedious. We build pictures and narratives of other people in our heads by what they say to and emote at us, but that medium is communication is faulty. It serves for the most part, but we won’t recognise the assumptions we make about the intentions of the message the other sent us, assuming we understood what they meant, and be right a lot of the time, but it’s the times we are wrong that screw us over. 

    In personal communication there’s no parity bit to check against.

    I recognise my problem with your phrasing is probably rooted in this afore-described beef with communication and preference in biuniqueness, but I felt it worth mentioning, if only to make myself think through and acknowledge this personal bias.

      Altered to "when she took away her love of you", but I don't know when I did that, because I went to go make the change and it was already changed. *shrug*

      > I feel like a full stop isn’t the right punctuation here. A — or … would’ve fit better.

      To me, "so ..." is kind of a drawn out sound, like "sooooo", or trailing off, while "so —" is almost cut off. The reason it was "so." is because the sentence is just coming to an end there without ceremony. (I imagine that using punctuation like that probably drives some people nuts, but it's my preference.)

      Fixed all the rest.

    Hopefully improved from Earth standards by Amaryllis - if she can make a VCR from parts, she can definitely do better than the Earth norm for prosthetic hands.

    When/if Grak gets to Loyalty 10, do you expect Joon will be able to heal the amputation using soul and bone magic?
    ```

    - u/cthulhuraejepsen:
      ```
      I'm not actually sure how good you can make a prosthetic without microchips, which is what most of the modern ones use in order to allow people to have movable fingers and full(er) range of motion in the limb. The problem with losing a hand is that unless you connect directly to the nerves themselves, you have to move the prosthetic fingers using existing muscles, usually by repurposing some muscle function you don't usually use. For example, the "hook" hands usually co-opt shoulder movement; you clamp or release using a kind of rolling motion of your shoulder. (There's a fiction book by Max Barry, *Machine Man* that goes into some of the problems with prosthetics from an engineering and design standpoint. As a fun fact, it was also written serially, one (short) update a day.) We're passing some of those hurdles now, but the missing piece, aside from investment, seems to have been on-board programming and connecting to existing nerves. (Note: amateur opinion)

      Grak got his Loyalty 10 in ch 78, which gave him the ability to see magic without his warder's monocle, among other things.

      I'll have to RAFO the other question, because it will get discussed in a future chapter, but the only on-screen amputations have been Joon's fingers in ch 21, and his hand in ch 50, both of which were fixed with a level up.

      Assuming he's spending 1/50 of his life writing at 50wpm, that's roughly half an hour per day, or alternatively two two-hour stints per week, plus unspecified thinking time which may add up to another 4 hours per week. I wonder how productive the maximally productive (competent, and entertaining) author could be?
      ```

      - u/cthulhuraejepsen:
        ```
        50wpm would be 3K words per hour, which would be *absolutely insane.* My rate is more towards 500 words per hour, sometimes as high as 1000 words per hour when I'm in a nice flow state (and sometimes much lower than 500 words per hour, when my brain isn't behaving).

        I can give some comparisons to other authors. Stephen King has a daily word count goal of 2000 words. Same goes for Brandon Sanderson, who also has that as his daily goal. These are famously prolific authors, writing full time. [Per Sanderson,](http://faq.brandonsanderson.com/node/309) the low end of how much he writes is four or five hours a day, which would come out to 500 words per hour.

        As another example, Ray Bradbury famously wrote the original version of *Farenheit 451* in nine days; it was 25,000 words, and his publisher suggested that he double its length, which he did in another nine days. That's an average of 2,777 words per day, done in a frenzy, and considered so fast that it's notable.
        ```

        - u/eaglejarl:

          As another data point, I also average 500 words per hour and hit 1,000 when things are in flow.

          To be fair, both Sanderson and /u/cthulhuraejepsen may write for their mainstream careers (though Sanderson may be full-time) as well.

I guess I was already aware that Fenn felt insecure about herself, but after reading that letter and realizing that she thought any of the stuff that had happened to her might be something worth breaking up with her for, I really wanted every single character to just give her a hug.

  Great chapters. I am enjoying this arc much more than the Fallahter one, I think the constant paranoia got to me with that arc (not that I disliked that arc mind). Despite initial appearances the house seems much more agreeable than I initially thought, and things not being quite so strained definitely helps my enjoyment here.

  It did make me wonder about Ropey though. Ropey clearly has far more intelligence than Joon believed (definitely above toddler level). I wonder if it could be a companion if he actually started to see it as more of its own person (rope?).

  Well Bethel is more than a little overpowered. So presumably she's a regenerating mobile tank, plausibly one that can be carried around, with nigh-infinite resources, a time machine and rather absurd magical weapons.

  I am struggling to think of a good get-rich quick scheme, though, because presumably the value cap on backpack retrievals still counts even though the size limit could otherwise include planes (or smaller houses). Just magic-ing up libraries, clothing, etc. is the smartest idea I've had so far, which is pretty weak since selling things takes time and just having bars of gold would short-circuit so much. Maybe trying to find jewelry with some quantity of gold (to be melted for its components), and flooding the room with that? Would make being a gold mage pretty fun. Any better ideas?

  ---

  EDIT: Here are some solutions.

  1. Drink some gold. The Everflask will then produce that quantity on a daily basis. 100ml of gold is 2kg, or $80k at our prices. More importantly, that's a lot of gold for a gold mage: 700kg per year.

  2. Bethel seems to have extremely high fidelity in what she can do, and Fenn's He-Man skit shows the backpack creates things in precisely controlled positions. Thus although you might not be able to pull a car out of thin air, it seems you should be able to pull all of the *pieces* of a car out in the appropriate place at the same time. Voilá, instant megafactory.

  3. EDIT: /u/CaptainMcSmash gives another great solution: try using the Everflask to summon unicorn blood.

  I don't think the banter has ever been stronger. These chapters have seriously sold me on Joon/Fenn, and even Grak is starting to grow on me now that he has been shown to loosen up. 

  Bethel is an interesting addition to the cast, no one can ever accuse this fic of not being racially diverse when one member is a deer and another member is a house. I really liked the whole conceit of their group paranoia souring diplomatic relationships before they have the chance to start, and having to really stick their necks out to trigger Bethel's companionship.
  ```

- u/PurposefulZephyr:
  ```
  Lovely thing, so many chapters. Gaped at it in disbelief, but I guess we didn't see an update in a while, huh. :P

  I was worried about Amaryllis going off the rails and becoming an inhuman monster, or at least a highly proficient manipulator. Thankfully, that doesn't seem to be the case.

  Plenty of character interaction, with my favorite bit being the conversation between Ropey and Zona... though I am worried, since the title for his chapter wasn't comforting.

  Speaking of foreboding titles:  "Immanentize the Eschaton" felt like Zona or Amaryllis were going to go completely off the rails, but thankfully it was *just* a problem with the pregnancy. 

  Not that it won't be a chancy encounter, just... chapter **100** and that kind of title *really* set off red flags for me. Now we can get to Labor 101. :P

   Also, speaking of various bits and pieces:

  >***Flow State:***    *Allows you to enter into an analytical flow state, which  temporarily doubles working memory with respect to the subject of  analysis, halves the penalties for thirst, hunger, and exhaustion, and  increases the chance of a Brilliant Insight by five percent per hour  \(compounding\).*  

  I love brain upgrades. Or thinking upgrades, so those perks were a real morsel. And this, *this*... felt underused, just another thing he grinded up. 

  Working memory is the workbench of your mind, and just doubling it's size... it should allow for some advanced considerations of complex problems, like the problems Amaryllis was going to face. Let's not forget the golden nugget of a *Brilliant Insight*, which could become quite certain with a day to spare... 

  Actually, wait\- does every hour get an increasing chance of Brilliant Insight? Can you get more than one BI for a single usage of a Flow State \(regardless of it's length\), or one every hour?

  Either way\- that feels like a big upgrade, and I hope to see it in action.
  ```

  - u/nytelios:
    ```
    All I could think about while trying to munchkin Flow State was "hey, people have this superpower in the shower..."

    But yes, it does read like the chance increases per hour. Depends on what it means by (compounding) though. If it works like normal interest compounding, it'd be (1+0.05)^hrs. That'd have extraordinary synergy with the time chamber, especially if it gives a capital-B Brilliant Insight.
    ```

  - u/aeschenkarnos:
    ```
    Grinding Brilliant Insights may be a worthwhile use of the time chamber. Go in for a subjective week, come out with a recipe for *perfect* banana fritters, a new spell, the reason why dogs bark at nothing, a technique for morning-star vs halberd combat, a screenplay of a sequel to *The Sum of Us* (1994), and the overwhelming need to craft an entad.

- u/GenericBohr:
  ```
  A fan theory I've been noodling lately:

  You could make an infinite depth pit by having an array of void weapons pointing down, so long as they can produce void faster than you fall. Presumably you'd also need a magical effect to fill the void with air, so that you'd reach a terminal velocity (and also, ya know, be able to breathe). If you keep accelerating, presumably you'd hit the limit of your void magic.

  Because there seems to be a finite volume of water on Aerb (i.e. no infinitely deep lakes), it implies a lack of permanence to the boundless pit, or all the water would have already flowed into it. 

  If you need access to the sources of magic to Exclude them (which seems necessary, given the Ice Magic story), it could be Uther was trying to Exclude "void" by catching up to the void drills shooting down the boundless pit. But in that case you'd want teleportation magic, maybe try and use revision magic to effectively slow down the descent of things within the pit?

  But obviously if you really wanted to explore it you'd have multiple people so one could sleep while the other is the lookout. 

  I feel Uther would have come to a similar conclusion, so perhaps the pit isn't boundless but actually has a loop in the middle? But then where is all the water going... 

  I feel the mechanics and exploration of the pit will be important. But I do not know how, or what the mechanics could be.
  ```

  - u/Noumero:
    ```
    Interesting speculations. Though,

    >Because there seems to be a finite volume of water on Aerb

    That's a major assumption. Perhaps there is some kind of Excluded *ex nihilo* waterfall, or perhaps the Athenaeum of Water Magic has a duty to humanity to produce X quantities of water per year to replace the water lost to the Pit.

  - u/cthulhuraejepsen:
    ```
    > Quick question: wouldn't Bethel be able to detect whether the baby has a heartbeat, stuff like that?

    By that point in the pregnancy (~35-36 weeks), you'd be able to hear a fetal heartbeat using a stethoscope, which Amaryllis has presumably already done (or she would have mentioned not being able to hear a heartbeat). The worry isn't so much that the baby is dead, more that there's something seriously wrong that hasn't made itself known yet, and won't until (still)birth.

    > How dangerous is a four weeks early pregnancy?

    Depends on the specifics. The biggest risk for premature babies is usually the lungs, which are one of the last important things to develop, and one of the reasons that you often see premies with breathing masks or intubation. Other than that, there are infection risks from under-developed immune systems, digestive problems from under-developed intestines, and other, somewhat less common issues. Infant mortality for "late preterm" is about three times higher in the US/UK, IIRC.

    Premature preterm rupture of membranes gives something like 1/50 chance of infant death (in the United States), with a whole host of other complications also possible. It's left unstated how long Amaryllis has waited after her water broke to see whether she would go into labor, but the longer you go without going into labor, the higher the risk (depending on the specifics, they'll either use steroids to help promote lung growth and antibiotics to fight infection, or they'll induce labor if it doesn't happen on its own).

    (Note: I am not a doctor, but neither are the characters, so hopefully it's okay if they make the occasional mistake here.)
    ```

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    > How dangerous is a four weeks early pregnancy?

    On 21st century Earth, not dangerous at all. The baby should easily be developed enough by then. The limit on viability is about 24 weeks, which is 16 weeks early.

    On Aerb with a mixture of Earth tech pulled from the backpack...hard to say. Might need to do a caesarean, since labor isn't starting, but that should be within their capabilities.

  So I didn't take a good look at how many chapters were released/didn't keep track of how many through I was, and I kept thinking each of them were the cliffhanger you'd said you left. Damn! You found a pretty good place, didn't feel jarring leaving it there, but it's also got some tension waiting for the next one.

  Excellent chapters! I'm hoping that Amaryllis doesn't choose to change the mother things, and of course that the birth works out. Though I suspect if it doesn't and Solace dies (can they do this ritual again if they grab her soul?? That would screw with them.and her in particular) then she'll definitely want to get rid of the feelings of losing a child and Joon might disagree. Though I could be totally wrong.

  Poor Fenn, glad Joon didn't freak out about it or anything, though now there is the son out there somewhere. Also, poor Amaryllis, the others were over the chamber, she would be seriously stir crazy. What a rough day/months.

  Grak has really come through in these chapters with how supportive of Amaryllis he's been, not that he didn't care before hand, but I find in this arc it's come out much more.

  New companion! Yay, also, starting to like the house more, and I can see how she became what she is. Must be so strange and disorienting to have parts added to you, that fundamentally change you. So yay for Bethel.

    There are food preservation techniques that can make food last for years. Canning, dehydration, freeze-drying... just grab a month's supply of cans from the backpack and don't forget the can opener. Or grab a month's supply of MREs and cup noodles and you won't even need the can opener. Plus, there is always the old standby of storing raw grain; humanity would have never gotten past the stone age if we hadn't been able to store enough food for a month.

    Incidentally, this pissed me off about _Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows_. They can _duplicate food_ but they are starving to death and ~~stealing~~ forcibly buying eggs? Come on. How hard would it have been to walk into a Muggle supermarket, buy a few cans, and duplicate all the food they could eat? If they don't have Muggle money and they feel bad about stealing, sell off a Galleon at a Muggle pawn shop first. Problem solved.

          Pretty sure you still can't duplicate it.  The actual quote is... 
          >“It’s impossible to make good food out of nothing! You can Summon it if you know where it is, you can transform it, you can increase the quantity if you’ve already got some-"

          I take 'increase the quantity' to mean making food much larger, like we see in the second year with the Engorgio charm on pumpkins, which seems to have some reasonable limit since we don't see mountain-sized pumpkins.

          However duplication is a different beast.  The only two things we know that are exceptions to *Gamp's Law of Elemental Transfiguration* are food and money.  And the only time we see the duplication charm in action, we're specifically informed that it doesn't circumvent Gamp's Law and that the duplicated items are still worthless (eg, duplicated items are significantly different from the originals). 

          It seems straightforward to me that duplication is a transfiguration type spell (since we would otherwise have to posit an additional fundamental law of magic to cover money twice over), and thus it also doesn't work on food.

          Also, I know Harry Potter characters are dumb, but they aren't so dumb to literally starve if they could just just magically duplicate food.  Especially because they specifically *are* using magic on the food already to make more of it and make it more appetizing.

      Also sable is a vacuum which means that any food stored inside it will last much longer by default.

  What's her plan? Some sort of soul magic shennanigans, but what? Try to copy Solace into someone?

  [SAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasonal_affective_disorder). A bit of a meta reference there.

  >She’s almost frighteningly sympathetic to my cause \(the cause, currently, of being the best girlfriend I can be\).

  I submit that Fenn's interpretation is unreliable. Amaryllis is thinking about this from the pregnancy/motherhood/attachment angle.

  >remind me to tell you about the mashed potato incident

  Clearly she hasn't read any Watterson. Otherwise it would be a "noodle" incident.

  ...

  The idle line about the lack of illusion of mind operates also as a warning not to shy away from Zona's account of Arthur

    > What's her plan? Some sort of soul magic shennanigans, but what? Try to copy Solace into someone?

    This is a reference to ch 93:

    > There were some other ideas she’d been kicking around that I was less enamored with.

    > “We can rush Solace,” said Amaryllis. “When she’s born, you’ll take a look at her soul, and if it looks like everything but her body is as it should be, then we’ll have you do a wholesale replacement of her physical self. Then all we should need to do is heal her into that form, rendering her a full adult and capable druid a few minutes after I’ve given birth to her.”

    > “That … does make some sense,” I said. “I would think there would be some problems as far as mass goes. Do you know whether bone magic actually replaces lost mass?”

    > “Our only reference book on bone magic is The Commoner’s Guide to Bone Magic, which unsurprisingly doesn’t go into it,” said Amaryllis. “And yes, that’s something that we should test before trying it. Obviously if the magic is cannibalizing other muscle, fat, or bone, we’re not going to be able to turn a six pound baby into a hundred pound woman. In general concept though, what do you think?”

  I wonder why juniper seems to assume that Arthur also had a game
