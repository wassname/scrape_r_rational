## [D] On the rational use of Superpowers

### Post:

Hey first time poster, I didn't want to post in an old thread so I'm making a new one but this is related to the question posed in [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2jbfz5/d_q_whats_up_with_superman/).  Hope this is on topic for this sub I know mostly this is for fictional stories but I think it might be interesting to discuss this here. I have a detailed explanation below but I'm essentially saying the way people like Superman act in comics IS probably the most rational way to use superpowers.

Essentially if you woke up tomorrow and everything was the exact same, except you suddenly had "god-like" powers, essentially omnipotent for all intents and purposes. What would you do with that power? When I first started thinking on this topic I always figured I would help humanity one way or the other. Build roads, cure diseases, stop war, end world hunger etc. but as I thought more about those things I realized that doing some of those could cause more harm than good. 

Curing diseases would probably cripple modern health care systems by making it essentially obsolete, even if you just cured a few of the big ones you would have developed the expectation in the general populace that you CAN magically cure diseases.  Long term I'm imagining less money going into healthcare research, less doctors and less patients since people would start looking to you instead of previously established services. I think the world hunger thing is obvious with the majority of the world involved in farming you would cripple countless peoples livelihood. Even if you just redistributed the food you are talking about taking huge chunks of the shipping industry out of action at the very least, again having huge negative impacts in the long term despite the short term benefit of people not dying of hunger temporarily. 

I guess to sum it up I would use the fish quote "give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime". Any action you could take as an individual would never be as helpful as actually developing the systematic methods that regular people could use to sustain those actions over the long term. It's way better to have an inefficient but sustainable system then it is to do good things outside the system thus harming the development of that system.  Essentially I feel like people don't really think deeply enough about how complicated our world is and how even something simple like building some bridges or the like could have huge unforeseen consequences, like putting bridge builders out of work, or even thinking about who would end up paying to maintain that bridge. 

But even further than that how about just teaching people how to do things like cure cancer or build better bridges? Now you are altering the course of human society in a fundamental way. Are we ready for a society like Star Trek or the Culture or would humanity reject that sort of rapid development in its current state? Personally my only conclusion here is that if someone really did gain those powers there is really only one good option... which is to do nothing with that power except in exceptional circumstances like an asteroid or all out nuclear war. In order to really help people you have to let them figure shit out on their own, you can't be holding their hand all the time or as Futurama put it "...You have to use a light touch". Which is essentially how Superman is usually written oddly enough, he saves us from the big external threats but almost never from our internal ones. 

That's my take on how to rationally use superpowers, I'm very interested in how people respond to this I would love if someone could think of counter-examples. I've been pondering this for a few years now but I can't seem to figure out a good way to help humanity in any significant way without completely changing what humanity means on a fundamental level essentially destroying it in one way or the other.

TL;DR: Helping humanity only makes us reliant on that help, we have to stand alone or not at all if we want to truly succeed in the long term. Only the impending doom of all of humanity would be a good reason to act decisively in our interests, anything else would just hurt us in the long term.

  Ehh...

  It depends on how much power is meant by 'essentially omnipotent'. In any case, thinking about what to do would be the first point on my list, but I strongly doubt my end conclusion would be 'do essentially nothing'. The world we have now is not perfect.

  One of the first things to do if the powers allow it to be done safely is to increase my own intelligence, in order to be better able to gauge what else needs doing. But maybe that's not possible safely, that is, without risking accidentally making myself insane or dead.

  But, to take a low-end example from you, 'curing diseases' would seem like a good thing to do. Sure, it has some negative consequences. Health care systems are needed less, people lose jobs and so on. But that's nowhere near the magnitude of millions of people dying to diseases. Or you could just cure all diseases that current medicine cannot cure. I hardly expect the losses to medical research funding are worth all the suffering caused by the status quo. Of course, it's better if 'cure diseases' means 'create a formula for a cure that people can easily manufacture and administer' rather than 'touch sick people and they're suddenly healthy', because the latter is much more reliant on me personally and more difficult to study and replicate.

  Then there's 'end world hunger'. How do you achieve this? Invent and implement massively more efficient system for producing and transporting food? Seems like a good thing to me overall. 

  It is difficult to think of things to do that are unquestionably good and have no negative consequences whatsoever, but it seems to me to be much easier to think of things to do that have positive consequences that outweigh the negative ones.

  I don't think the mere fact that something is disruptive to the current order is a reason not to do it. Power looms put hundreds of textile artisans out of business, but I don't think you're too likely to find anyone that says that the invention and production of the power loom was a bad thing.

  So yes, the existence of a godlike entity would fundamentally alter human society - I agree with that - but I don't think that the negatives of this would outweigh the positives if done correctly. And in fact, I feel that humanity is fundamentally altering itself with every passing year, and in most ways is becoming fundamentally better (lower crime rates, less war, happier people). Humanity has been radically changed in the last two or three hundred years, and on the whole these changes have not convinced me to be wary of change for the sake of being wary of change.

  (I also don't think that you'll get much sympathy in what is largely a community of transhumanists clamoring for brain uploading, artificial intelligence, and eternal life.)

  How is this a problem? Use your godlike powers to become immortal and just keep on curing diseases. Or if you worry that you'd get bored, create a race of ethereal, non-sentient (to avoid moral complications) guardian angels that will attach to each human and protect them from disease and trauma.

  > I think the world hunger thing is obvious with the majority of the world involved in farming you would cripple countless peoples livelihood.

  If I solve hunger, farmers won't be able to get jobs. They won't starve, either. They might have to sell their farms and find new jobs in order to stay clothed and so forth. I'm sobbing indeed.

  Or here's a thought: take over *all* production. Give everyone a desktop nano-assembler, restricted (with your godlike powers) from creating anything terribly dangerous. Now tons of people are out of jobs. You replace all governments with your godlike powers and restrict capitalism to a safe sandbox. People earn money for living, and they can earn more for serving others and for creative output. Personally, I'd adjust it so that a typical person has to work no more than ten years of 30-hour weeks to retire at a normal standard of living.

  If you want a more moderate solution, everyone has access to piles of soylent or some other not-very-flavorful nutrient source. (Again, you create a race of soylent angels to create and distribute it.) Farmed food is a luxury good, as are spices.

  > Any action you could take as an individual would never be as helpful as actually developing the systematic methods that regular people could use to sustain those actions over the long term.

  Because you're focused on keeping all the power in yourself rather than spreading it out into self-sustaining systems that will go on independent of your existence.

  > Only the impending doom of all of humanity would be a good reason to act decisively in our interests, anything else would just hurt us in the long term.

  Scale that down to an individual level. How well does that work? Terribly. I refuse to engage in any charity unless it saves people's lives from their deathbeds. Preventative measures? Pah. Improving standards of living from kill-me-now to I-can-actually-tolerate-this? Weak-minded liberal nonsense. There's a disease going around that makes people's limbs drop off? Not worth bothering me about. A cure for HIV if I just donate my pocket change? Forget about it; HIV doesn't kill you, it just weakens you so much that the sniffles would kill you. Lead paint in the milk? Sure, feed it to the children.

  Yeah, no.

  First, as other already said, improve intelligence. Since I can't predict what I'll think one that's done (which is the whole point of doing it), I can't really predict what I'd do afterward. My current 'plan' is something along the lines of:

   - Figure out how to make a post-scarcity society of immortals work
   - End scarcity
   - End death
   - ???

  The instant I realize I have such a power, I stop time.

  I'll get back to you in an objective instant several million subjective years later when I finish thinking this through.
