## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  Also might work well for world building, but I watched a documentary yesterday about Kim Jong-un and it reminded me of a long standing thought. Kim Jong-un for those who don't know is the current leader of North Korea, but unlike some of the others he was educated in the west. In Switzerland, in particular from the age of around 10 to 18. There was some hope when this first came out that perhaps he'd be more understanding to the west as a result. He doesn't seem to have been, but my question is could he have been. Lets say your told tomorrow that you are Kim Jong-il's long lost son or daughter and will be inheriting the country. Assuming that there is no chance of anyone doubting the legitimacy of your inheritance (at least no more than there was for Kim Jong-un). What do you do? Obviously this depends heavily on an almost unknowable balance of power inside the country. One of the first things Kim Jung-un appears to have done is disposed with many of the political and military old guard.

  I for one don't know. I don't think modernizing North Korea would be an easy task for anyone.

    I'm reminded of the [Merchant Princes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Family_Trade) 
    series by Charles Stross. The story is about a family that can jump back and forth between 2 universes, one of which never advanced beyond the dark ages, and the other being modern earth. Most members of the family are raised and educated in the dark ages world where the family's power base is strongest, but the main character (the long lost heir in this metaphor) was raised in our world with no knowledge of the other side. While she isn't dropped straight on the throne with no preamble, she still has influence simply by being able to swap between worlds, and attempts to affect a reformation of the way the family does business.

    * I am going to be worried losing power internally and getting tortured/executed in a military coup first and foremost.  

    * After that... we need foreign dollars... the current strategy of exporting workers as wage slaves seems to be working okay for that purpose?  I would try to use that to build up more modern skills in the population.  

    * I would cut back on the military posturing bullshit. (I can't think of any negative International Politics side effects to this, but I would be worried about the internal power dynamics with my army generals and such...)

    * Cut back on the death camps for my own people bullshit.  Seems stupid and wasteful

    * Gradually (I'm think over a decade or two) dial back the propaganda from batshit insane with supernatural claims, to only extremely patriotic.

    * Gradually scale back the Potemkin villages and stop my underlings from feeding me BS about the state of everything.  This is critical for my long term plans...

    * I would be divided, long term, between:

     * trying to develop more factories/technologies to produce products for export for a typical modern economy (and then import food/medicine/technology and such to stop the starvation and mass death).

     * Trying to develop purely self-sufficient/"green" technology to support a society with zero environmental impact.  If I just ask for this without training my people to stop showing me Potemkin villages and such, I will get BS results.  I want to actually succeed at this.

      * When/if I actually get model villages that at least partially succeed (some Potemkinness is to be expected, but I want it to at least develop some real technologies), I will invite Western Celebrities and documentary makers and such to tour it and see how effective it is, then sell parts of the technology to super rich Westerners that can afford it.



    * Third, crazy idea...  Right now, to do testing on rats or mice there is like a bunch of ethics form to fill out and have reviewed by an oversight board or two.  To use electrodes for recording neural data from humans you have to use epilepsy patients that have them implanted already for medical purposes.  Genetic modification on rats and mice also has ethical limitations.  I will try to create a scientific environment with a much looser set of ethical guidelines, and then attract scientists from across the world who would prefer to work with less ethics.  As an added bonus, my foreign scientists get servants and a wealthy style of living, so long as they keep doing their work and publishing papers (in foreign peer-reviewed journals that I know are reputable instead of internal journals that would become echo-chambers designed to satisfy me)

     * A big goal would be developing new medical treatments or important scientific results to showcase Best Korea's scientific community and mock how the Western's ethics hold them back.

     * The major end goal is genetic modification in Primates, then in humans.  The techniques are already being invented, not at a level i would want to use on a human, but soon they will be there but no one will be willing to use them.  I will sell designer baby services to super rich Western couples and such.  Fixing disease, and maybe a few genes strongly correlated with intelligence or good immune systems.

      * I would have the elite Koreans get education and be allowed to work as grad students for these scientists.

    I think in North Korea's case it might be possible. But in the abstract, it can be really hard for any individual to take on the deep state. It's built from decades or centuries of habits, and people expect it to keep doing the same thing and keep getting the same payouts. That sort of economic web is hard to disrupt without getting a lot of people on board. Think about Bernie Sanders trying to undo the military industrial complex in the US, it probably wouldn't be achievable without broad support from people inside the military industrial complex.

      On the other hand, Stalin's death and Khrushchev gaining power did lead to improvements in the Soviet Union. It wasn't immediate, and the USSR did not become a western democracy, but within a couple of years it had slowed down on mass-murdering its citizens. This suggests that the person in charge is able to effect some change.

  What do you guys think about performance enhancing drugs, physical (/r/steroids /r/PEDs) and mental (/r/nootropics /r/afinil)?

  I have been reading about physical PEDs for years now, but I was never willing to take the step into buying illegal material from sketchy sources. From the research it does seem that these drugs being illegal is just a matter of "sport fairness" rather than them being extremely dangerous.

  For nootropics I have been reading for a decade or so, and have been using Piracetam for nearly a decade as well. It has really been a lifesaver for me. Have been using Modafinil sporadically for a year as well, but I don't like how "robotic" it makes me in my thought process. Plus it makes it hard to fall asleep on that day, which interferes with my training. Pity because aside from that the complete lack of tiredness was quite useful.

  Have you guys used any of these tools?

    I don't know how much it's worth. The conventional wisdom seems to be that we haven't really found any magic bullet yet. Everything we've found seems to have some major side affects. I'd question the sources your finding claiming they don't because I suspect they could easily be biased depending on where your getting them.

    I feel that if any of this worked really well the army would be using it. Goodness knows they didn't have any problems doing testing surrounding these kinds of things.

    On the other hand I haven't actually done the research. Maybe some of them should be more commonly.

      >I'd question the sources your finding claiming they don't because I suspect they could easily be biased depending on where your getting them.

      Fair point, although there is extensive scientific research that has been done on many compounds. Not as extensive as we'd need to assure safety, especially at the doses that healthy people looking for enhancement are taking, but still some is available.

      >I feel that if any of this worked really well the army would be using it. Goodness knows they didn't have any problems doing testing surrounding these kinds of things.

      They are. Obviously officially they are denying it, but unofficially the use of PEDs in the military and in the police is very extensive. And it makes sense: if your life depended on your physical fitness level, wouldn't you take them too?

      >On the other hand I haven't actually done the research. Maybe some of them should be more commonly.

      Definitely. The issue with PEDs being made illegal is not as much medical as much as it is political, since the whole movement to ban it had been born after the steroids scandal in Baseball in the '90s, and it  has been simply pushed along until now. Hopefully with the current movement to legalize all drugs and educate people we'll see them being legalized as well.

  After hearing a lot about it, I recently started watching [Legend Of The Galactic Heroes](http://myanimelist.net/anime/820/Ginga_Eiyuu_Densetsu). *Good vs Good* and *Evil vs Evil* are the two tropes I really like and so far this has the former. So really liking it. 

  What are the books/movies/anime/fanfic that you like which has any of these tropes ?

  Speaking of screenshot editing, discovering r/4chan led to a rather interesting journey of learning how to crop screenshots well. There are many criteria by which the quality of a crop can be measured--no wrapped lines of text; no large expanses of empty space; no interstitial comments that don't contribute to the joke--but they all boil down to how quickly and easily the image can be read on the screen of a phone. The spectrum of "good crop" runs from "minimum effort necessary"--e.g., [reducing browser-window width and stitching multiple screenshots together](http://i.imgur.com/VCZSnwZ.png)--to "above and beyond"--e.g., [editing the code of the source page to make the content easier to read in proper sequence](http://i.imgur.com/ysQqZP1.png).

  The issue is much more interesting than the r/4chan mods' peremptory "Shitty Crop" flairs make it seem at first glance.

    On *The Tragedy of Shere Khan*:

    Intellect is, from the middle-distance, indistinguishable from villainy. Heroes don't have to think, they have to act. In fact, it's usually better they don't think and we simply forget the heroes that get themselves killed in favor of celebrating the ones that save lives in times of need.

    Intelligent sorts, blessed with foresight, tend to do a lot of complaining when nothing is going seriously wrong and (worse!) demanding lots of money and effort for disasters that aren't actually happening right now. When their foretold disaster does, indeed, arrive it turns out that even if we spent money and effort in advance it's STILL awful in ways even intellect couldn't predict... so that money, effort, and complaint is essentially wasted.

    Sometimes the disaster doesn't come for decades, but the costs don't seem to decrease and the intellectuals *never shut up*.

    Finally, if we *didn't* spend the money and effort, and the disaster *does* arrive exactly as they predict... then the complainers stand around telling us "I told you so," and supervising ineffectually, instead of just throwing their lives away like proper would-be heroes.

    You'll notice, in most stories, that it's the villains who command armies and plan ahead. The villains set up plots and contingency plans, build cities and fortresses, establish quasi-government organizations. The heroes fight alone or in small groups, dragged through life by the whims of the villains that surround them on all sides...

    ...the villains preparing for the future, innovating, and generally running the world.

  So. Any tips on the best optical solution for adding infrared and ultraviolet to the visible spectrum?  Currently Im considering jurry rigging something together involving an oculus rift, but I have no idea what sensors should be used to gather the infrared or ultraviolet data feeds. It would be most convinient to work with a pixel by pixel spectograph, since then it would be trivial to shift things to arbitrary visible wavelengths as desired, but Im pretty sure most cameras don't work like that.
  ```

  - u/traverseda:
    ```
    Near-infrared is as easy as removing the filter from a webcam, and replacing it with a filter that removes all visible light. It looks like near-UV [might be similar](http://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/2262/are-digital-sensors-sensitive-to-uv).

    If your goal is just general sensory enhancement, then you might be better served by eularian video enhancement. Probably the closest thing I know to "real" sensory enhancement, just behind the more outlandish claims of what the northpaw does for your sense of direction.
    ```

  - u/blazinghand:
    ```
    Is your goal just to detect presence or absence of this kind of stuff, or something more fine-grained? The issue with something like a VR headset is it obstructs traditional vision, so you would no longer be able to get visible light to your eyes. 

    Things like thermographic cameras definitely exist, and setting something up where you have a thermographic camera that pipes the output to a video encoder that encodes the video on the fly and hands it off to an android device or a google glass like device or something. This would let you watch the video as an overlay or as a HUD in the corner of your vision in addition to being able to see as normal.

    So, this is definitely possible, but would be a big project. I'm sure what I just described has all kinds of problems that we haven't even thought of yet, but "figure out how to hook up a thermographic camera to your preferred display" seems like step 1.

    [This](http://www.instructables.com/id/Infrared-IR-Webcam/?ALLSTEPS) (and related things) looks like an easy and cheap way to get infrared images.  I don't know what it does with respect to the three color channels that it uses (eg: normally "Red, Green, Blue" becoming "Mid-Infrared, Nonfunctional, Nonfunctional" or "Near-Infrared, Mid-Infrared, Far-Infrared" or "Mid-Infrared, Mid-Infrared, Mid-Infrared").

    [This](http://www.instructables.com/id/Photography-in-the-Ultraviolet-spectrum/?ALLSTEPS) looks like a similar project for a UV camera, but the comments on it make me a bit skeptical to whether or not it would work.

    I don't have a good idea for combining them, but a semi-silvered mirror might work to get the same image to both cameras simultaneously, and then use software to combine them into one picture.

    EDIT: The commercial multispectral cameras I could find didn't look very promising.  They are specialized professional products, with presumably matching prices.
