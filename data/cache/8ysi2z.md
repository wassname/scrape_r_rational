## Doubts in The Deathworlders web series (spooler)

### Post:

I recently started reading the deathworlders series and enjoying it a lot, I was actually confused by some plot events. Earth has been quarantined and a barrier has been erected , but some how they were able transport to a planet way over in a galaxy and colonize it, how did they get past the barrier,.

  It's a physical barrier, teleports can still go through, but they require a receiver station on the other side. I think it was Kirk who got them one?

    Ohh when Kirk was stationed near Jupiter, he might have given , or that could have engineered from the wreck of the hunters ship on earth, so to summarize Kirk set up a station the planet , and there was one on earth, which was used to teleport military , civilian population.

      Yeah, Kirk smuggled them a teleporter, and also gave them some hints on how it might work - they make their own engines based off of those two things
      ```

  I'm not sure if you ever read Salvage which is another story in the same universe (there's some small crossover) but there were other humans out in the galaxy that had a base on the planet that they transport to which is why the receiver was out there.

  Haven't read that far back in awhile so I may be hazy on details.

  ```
  The early chapters incorporate a lot of stuff from the other series in this world and doesn't go into too deep of a recap, so a lot of details (possibly important ones) can be missed if you're only reading the main series.
  ```

    ```
    The [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/wiki/ref/universes/jenkinsverse) is pretty well maintained
