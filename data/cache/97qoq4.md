  Remove One Half Of is vague enough that it sounds incredibly broken.

  Instantly bisect any object of any material? In combat it pretty much oneshots any hostiles they've encountered so far. 

  Does it have a size limit? Could it work on, say, one half of a building? A mountain? A country? 

  Does it work on concepts? Remove one half of all your problems? Remove half of the hostile creatures in the dungeon?

    I like that you're the first person to scale it up to destroying civilizations.  Everyone else was thinking way too small.

  I wanna know what -10% entropy does.

      Simple!  It adds one additional hour that can only be utilized for sleep.

      I'm.... not quite clear on how to access that hour.  Don't ask me that.

    Since it was mentioned how they struggle to keep the apartment clean I just assumed it will now be 10% less messy and will 10% more time to get cluttered.

    Maybe they age slower, and food takes more time to go bad?

    I seriously feel like it could be munchkinned into p=Np.

    ◇(not a delta but the best I can do on mobile) ◇G=◇H-T◇S

    Shit actually thinking about it, -10% entropy actually probably makes the apartment lethal to be in, since it mucks with reactions being able to occur. Unless it just delete entropy after the reaction happens...? Suddenly you have to be 10% warmer in order for your cells to be able to burn sugar etc. Scary. Rip James sister.

  So I just binged this whole story. I'm such a sucker for gradual power up stories. 

  Anyway, purple orbs seem to be the best by far. You stack physical upgrades so you can fight better and loot more without getting hurt since injury downtime is a major reason they aren't going in constantly. Don't understand why they aren't prioritizing trading in yellows for them when they realized it was doable.

    I, too, just finished binging. I agree completely. Purple orbs are super powerful, rivaled only by yellow orbs with combat skills. They've honestly been wasting yellow orbs by cracking them and getting mostly useless skills. A more rational course would be to prioritize getting an iLipede farm, characterize all yellows, and trade any yellows that don't sound useful to the tree.

    Other irrational things they're doing:

    Wasting green orbs on anything other than their own apartment. Gaining sleep or lowering costs increases your dungeon capability! You can wait a few years to improve the hospital, right now you need to do everything possible to bootstrap your dungeon exploitation ability! Everything is an investment!

    Most importantly, a few chapters ago, they made a critical error. They turned Frank over to the police instead of keeping him and interrogating him. This is horribly stupid for two reasons:

    1. Frank is insane. He sells people out to die. There is no way the police are going to contain him for life, which is what needs to happen. He's going to get out of jail and he will remain a threat.
    2. More importantly, he knows things. There are clear gaps in his knowledge, but he has valuable knowledge about the enemy. He knows how to interact with the stuffed suits, and he knows something about the process of selling people off to them. He might know what happens to those people! He might know where Thea and Susan are! By not interrogating him, they threw away their best possible lead.

    So yeah, the protagonists have made some real bad mistakes. But that's just realistic, most people make huge mistakes when there's a lot going on.
    ```

    - u/Weebcluse:
      ```
      Yeah, popping purples to reliably stack physical buffs is clearly a solid game plan.

      I think there is some real hidden potential with the red orbs though. The emotional resonance seems to promote maturity with the stated emotion. Allowing you to communicate your feelings more effectively and causes you utilize the emotion more productively. Keeping a clear head is important in achieving the optimum results.

      Although that does seem like the sort of thing that would slightly alter someones personality. I can see why most of the group doesn't like them.
