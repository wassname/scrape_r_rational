## Fantasy Uplift stories like A Hero's War?

### Post:

Just got through reading Destiny's Crucible and the Hero's War web novel. Any books similar to those would be appreciated.

  Release that Witch is a Chinese novel that is very similar to Hero's War. The MC is an engineer that woke up in the body of a prince in a fantasy world with magic and different warring races. He starts off in charge of a tiny town in terrible conditions because no one expects him to inherit the throne. A lot of the story involves him finding witches and using their magic abilities to kick-start the industrial revolution.

    I've read a fair bit of Release that Witch, and yes, there are parallels. However, victories felt cheaper in that one than in A Hero's War. It seemed like timelines were too optimistic and without the slew of complications that any real world project would have. And the consistency with which everyone was amazed and delighted by a more egalitarian society doesn't mesh well with the level of prejudice that is supposed to exist outside said society.

    It's still decent writing, and an impressive quantity, I just find A Hero's War to be much more impressive.

      RTW basically uses witch magic to instantly get around issues of research and production which took decades or centuries in real history.

      It doesn't *quite* go "Oh hey a nuke would be useful to our medieval-level army" and five pages later, guess what, there's a nuke-witch knocking on the door asking for work, but it's not entirely escaped that kind of thing.

    I read until the dream world stuff started happening, and that *really* turned me off from the story. I don't know if that part gets dropped later or just handled better, but it genuinely ruined my enjoyment of the novel.
    ```

    - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:

      I agree the Dream stuff is terrible. It felt like I was suddenly reading two stories where one was the original uplift story that I like, and the other was the typical trashy story where an OP protagonist uses random magics he didn't work for to beat up enemies head on. And it does not get dropped or handled better.

      But if you push/skip through the trashy second story, the first story is still there and still awesome.

    It's also three billion chapters long. And I say that as someone who's several hundred in and slogging.

  If you don't mind something considerably slower and more character-oriented there's Ascendance of a Bookworm, which has a novel and anime.

  If you are interested in a more tongue-in-cheek approach to the industrial revolution, Terry Pratchett has some good novels in the Discworld series:

    Pity that Raising Steam was written under the embuggerance. It feels like cheap tinsel to the previous works' solid engineering.
    ```

      ```
      I couldn't get through that book. It felt like it was ghostwritten, and I keep remembering Sir Terry's condition affecting his prose and feel bad.
      ```

      - u/Geminii27:
        ```
        Ghostwritten badly, too, which was depressing. Like someone had written fanfic that kind of followed similar themes but simply had nowhere near the same depth and connectivity. It was honestly a rather disturbing metaphor for the effects of neural damage.

  Marked for Death tries to be, in a setting dead-set against that kind of thing.

    >Marked for Death

    Can't seem to find this one, name is too generic. Do you have a link or author name?
    ```

    - u/Cariyaga:
      ```
      Yeah, [here](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/marked-for-death-a-rational-naruto-quest.24481/). Ninja deathworld quest with politics that reinforce that. Player character's stated goal is uplift.

  I made a goodreads list with a similar theme after reading those two books: https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/140540.Engineering_uplift

  ```
  Not exactly what you are asking, but in [Lord of the Mysteries](https://m.wuxiaworld.co/Lord-of-the-Mysteries/1486806.html) the protagonist finds that the Industrial Revolution has already been started years ago by another reincarnated person (A bit similar to Worth the Candle). This is pretty compelling in that you don't need to suspend the disbelief of the protagonist not using his knowledge to his advantage, as most of the useful stuff is already in use.

    I love WtR, read it every day. And while the MC's primary goal is societal uplift, and it happens throughout the story, the actual uplift things are *usually* backgrounded, occasionally coming to the fore for a few chapters. If uplift is your *primary* interest, I'm not sure that WtR will really scratch that itch. Especially because it is very much NOT about developing the tech himself, but more about trying to get people to intelligently use things that exist/have been developed elsewhere and connecting people to better use their ideas/technologies.
    ```

    - u/Geminii27:
      ```
      It's a lot about the MC getting the people and super-technologies (ftl, mass teleportation, freeze rays, zap guns) which already exist in the DCU into mass production, which they obviously can't be in mainstream DCUs because that would make society rapidly diverge from our own.

      Plus going around plinking some of the supervillains and external threats which are sandbagging the world. Either removing them from the equation or giving them channels to go legit and make a ton of cash.

      I'd peg it as being less about uplift per se, and more about being a fix-fic for the DCU, using uplift as one of several methodologies.
      ```

      - u/eaglejarl:
        ```
        Except there's almost no actual uplift, at least not in the first million-ish words that I read before giving up. Sure, the MC makes noises about it, but he doesn't really *do* much. The exceptions are:

        1. Gets some upgrades for some of his teammates' tech. Also for their bodies in the Renegade sideline.
        2. Talks to Atlantis about using their magic for uplift... And then only actually used it to make anti-magic tech for himself and his friends.
        3. Talked to the Greek gods and the Amazons about making industrial amount of some of the special metals they have access to. Never actually did it, though.
        4. FINALLY, hundreds of thousands or a million words in, starts talking to London about setting up portals for public transport. AFAICR, it never actually happened before he wandered off into space, but at least he had the meetings.

        Zoat doesn't seem that interested in making society change and having to do the work of figuring out what that would mean. He wants the SI character to point out that it COULD change, and show how rational he is and how irrational all the locals are for not having done it (which is entirely true!), but he doesn't actually want to make it happen. Either that or he's just forgetting about plot threads as he moves on to the next shiny idea. The story isn't super tightly plotted.

      Where do you read it? Nothing really comes up in a quick Google search
      ```

      - u/failed_novelty:
        ```
        It was on Sufficient Velocity until the author displayed some pretty blatant transphobia (SV is supposed to be a safe space for all, and explicitly gave the terms he used as examples of stuff that'd get you a ban)  so last I heard he moved to QQ.

        This was after he ragequit SpaceBattles because they gave him a 1-day ban for not observing spoiler warnings for Star Wars 7.

    The MCs relationship with superboy really creeped me out. A turn off for me.
    ```

- u/daxisheart:
  ```
  Try orson scott card, the redemption of christopher columbus. This is more scifi-alt history, but after a quick sci-fi set up, it goes into how one team is trying to save the world by changing how europeans contacted the americas. Was a really good novel last I remembered.
  ```

- u/fassina2:
  ```
  Dr. Stone manga / anime. MC rebuilds civilization with science, it's great.

  &#x200B;

  There are too few good stories on this genre, it's definitely a good one for a new author to make his / her name in.. Destiny's Crucible sounds promising until you read the first goodreads review then you go, NOPE.

    I wouldnâ€™t listen to that guy too much. I really enjoyed the books. Yosef reminded me a lot of bob from the bobiverse books. 

    I highly recommend the audiobooks.
