  BTW he is getting $501 per month now. $249 more to three chapters per week. Come on guys, we can do this.
  ```

  - u/Taborask:
    ```
    I dunno if we should want that, there is a limit to how many good chapters he can put out a week. He ain't wildbow.
    And $750 a week isn't really enough for this this to be a full time job

    EDIT: sorry, I meant $750/month
    ```

      Do we know where he lives? $750/wk for a full time job is enough some places, far more than enough other places.

      Example: rural ohio where I have lived previously, where you can currently get a 3000sqft house on 5 acres of land for $1000/mo.

      Yeah, you definitely have a point.

  This chapter screams that Wekesa ain't gonna survive it, so he probably will.

  Updated Chapter:Interlude counts:

  * Book I - 28 Chapters, 0 Interludes (0% Interlude)
  * Book II - 49 Chapters, 11 Interludes (18% Interlude)
  * Book III (in progress) - 32 Chapters, 15 Interludes (32% Interlude)

  (where "Chapter" = specifically a non-interlude chapter, and prologues/epilogues are not included in either count)

  While I'm still enjoying the series, I'm not a big fan of the increased interlude ratio.

  The first book was solely a single-perspective affair; now, it's *almost* an ensemble cast (except it's too heavily skewed to Cat's perspective for that to be the case). Which is a shame, as the original single-perspective Cat narrative style is part of what drew me to the series in the first place.

  While I can only speak as an avid reader of fiction (not a writer), it seems like a lot of the information from the interludes could be passed to us via Cat's perspective (rumors she picks up, chats she has with Black, etc), as is the case in a lot of other single-perspective fiction. So the interludes certainly aren't *necessary* to the plot.

  And if the author truly wanted to shift to an ensemble narrative, they could have explicitly changed the structure of Book 3 (e.g. "Chapter" no longer means "From Cat's perspective") - which would actually have been interesting, in that it comes with additional implications (including that Cat no longer has plot armor).

  As it is now, the interlude-creep reads to me like the author is growing bored with Cat as the central protagonist. It's completely understandable, given the high content output; but as a result, I'm now wary of bumping up my donation to get to the "three chapters a week" tier, in case it leads to further author burnout (not to mention, as /u/Taborask points out, the potential decline in chapter quality in general).
  ```

    I personally like the interludes, since they tend to be more dense in terms of world building. It dances a line between the game of thrones style protagonist rotation, and the worm style of occasional alternate perspectives.

    The other advantage is for placing, it lets the main narrative play out at a more reasonable rate instead of being forced to constantly escalate, since we can get our adrenaline fix on "side characters". But I can see how it would be really frustrating if you just wanted to see more of cat and this other stuff kept getting in the way
    ```

    - u/tonytwostep:
      ```
      A major part of the problem is that the world-building shifting narratives are at odds with the first person narrative style of the "main" Cat chapters.

      I can think of plenty of well-written stories that focus on a central protagonist, but jump around to other characters for the occasional interlude chapters. However, almost all of them are third person. We're already watching the story from that "bird's eye view", so it's not jarring to slide from one character to another.

      In *Practical Guide*, we're in first person. We're literally in the head of the protagonist, seeing the world through her eyes. Our interpretation of events stems directly from Cat's interpretations of events. So constantly cutting from that narrative to a *third person* perspective of a different character is jarring, it breaks narrative flow, and in many cases (such as when we see a battle Cat's in, from one of her general's perspectives) is almost entirely unnecessary.

      Worm does use that same style, but in a low impact way, in that the interludes are almost entirely in the breaks between arcs (essentially, the prologues/epilogues of *Practical Guide*). So we experience an entire arc through Taylor's eyes, and then in the post-arc "downtime", we get an interlude from another character's perspective to build out the world. No narrative flows are broken. The few interludes that *are* mid-arc in Worm, are almost entirely unrelated to the arc in question - they're world-building short-stories, more akin to *Practical Guide*'s "Extra Chapters" (which I did not include in my counts, as I have no issue with them).
      ```

  - u/Yes_This_Is_God:
    ```
    Agreed. Writing's getting sloppier and the story is losing focus. 

    I like the focus on other characters, but these repeated interludes are dragging on the flow of the story as a whole.
    ```

    - u/tonytwostep:
      ```
      Exactly. Not to mention that grammar/spelling errors are noticeably increasing.
      ```

- u/None:
  ```
  I wonder if there is a equivalent for black on the heroes side, one that is methodical and dedicated the last year's of his life to raise a new generation of heroes, or the best that they've is bard that is too busy playing the long game to give a shit about the heroes?.

  Edit: I'm still waiting for a Pov chapter of the heroes, maybe the one to close the battle.
  ```

  - u/everything-narrative:
    ```
    Looks to me like the First Prince may have had a hand in it. Also looks like she may be carving a new name out of nothing.
    ```

- u/Evilness42:
  ```
  I must say, I was starting to get a little sick of the constant interludes in this book, but this one in particular more than makes up for it.
  ```
