  I saw this yesterday, just remembered to check here, and saw it hadn't been posted or maybe only has made it to a weekly post I missed: anywho take a look at r/qntm  qntm is smoothing out Ra's ending.

  The thing I disliked most out of Range was the ending. It is good he is rewriting it but honestly I will not have time to read it.

    I liked the fatalistic end. Sometimes we *fail.* Utterly and completely. That was what happened in Ra, a cascade of failure after failure on the part of humanity against a threat they had created themselves. The fact that anyone survived at all is a miracle.

      I think the thing most criticised about *Ra*'s ending isn't its downer nature — which is fantastic, I agree — but the way Rachel Ferno enters the plot at the last minute, shuffles everyone to the sidelines, and saves the day^(1) on her lonesome. Which is fixed here.

      Actually, this ending is even a *more* complete defeat. In the old one, Actual Humanity lost the new war and was forced to flee into the unknown, but with nobody dying. In the new one, Rachel — the person resurrection of whom was the main goal of one of the protagonists — anticlimactically and irrecoverably dies after doing nothing of consequence, and Actual Humanity is uploaded into Ra, in a full surrender to the Virtuals' ideology.

      It's perfect.
