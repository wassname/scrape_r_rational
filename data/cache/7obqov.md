  [Taylor's Gotta Power \[Worm/Dragonball\]](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/taylors-gotta-power-worm-dragonball.34428/) is not particularly rational, and has some ridiculous powerleveling implied by the crossover, but there are some neat ideas that I believe you'll appreciate:

  * Dinah's power works by giving probabilities of posited scenarios, usually yielding 20+ decimal digits of precision, limited by number of questions per day. Here Taylor devises a scheme that trades this superfluous precision for extra questions.
  * Scion is invisible to precognitive powers. Subsequently, putting real-time video feed of him into your glasses and predicating your own actions on his, you become unpredictable to any precognition further into the future than it takes for the signal to reach you.
  ```

  - u/NotACauldronAgent:
    ```
    By the way, that second one doesn’t work in canon-unless I am greatly mistaken, you can’t film Scion. Like, stranger power doesn’t show up in digital recordings.
    ```

    - u/Kilbourne:
      ```
      Does he have a persistent Stranger-effect? AFAIK there are extant recordings of him, and he appeared on the news.
      ```

        It may have been Fanon from somewhere? I know I’ve heard it but I can’t find the citation.

          ```
          His golden light power manipulates wavelengths and screws with electronics. He *has* been caught on video before, but it's supposed to be problematic. I think the most relevant example in this case is this: [Spoiler] (#s " Eidolon and Glaistig Uiane's fight with Scion was videotaped, and in 28.3 Tattletale claims that while the audio works, the video continuously cuts in and out. ")
          ```

    - u/xachariah:
      ```
      I don't think it's that you physically can't film him... it's just impractical to keep a camera on a being with a mover 10 rating who has no need for rest nor desire for downtime, and who chooses destinations at random.
      ```

- u/Marthinwurer:
  ```
  Dies the Fire is the first book in the Novels of the Change. The premise is that after a brief light show over Nantucket, all electronics and anything that requires a significant amount of gas compression (like cars and firearms) stop working. As these things are all fairly important to society, the book explores it's collapse as well as the people who work to rebuild it within the new laws of physics. If pikemen riding bicycles sounds wonderful to you, this series is probably for you. 

  Edit: just thought of another: The Guns of the South, where South African apartheid supporters use a time machine to send AK-47s back to the Confederates in the civil war in an attempt to keep slavery alive. Just as good as it sounds.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Dies the Fire was awesome. Unfortunately I thought the rest of the series was quite bad. I liked the first book so well I tried to forge through but the rest of the series is effecting a different genre, and in my opinion poorly written. Dies the Fire is thoroughly worth reading as a stand alone though.
    ```

    - u/Marthinwurer:
      ```
      Yeah, they get a bit weaker after the first trilogy. I also liked the companion Island in the Sea of Time series, which explore what happens with the island of Nantucket, whose modern version gets swapped with it's 3500BC one. It's definitely not as good as Dies the Fire, though.

  [*Nioh*](http://store.steampowered.com/app/485510) is a fun combination of:  
  \- The maze-like levels and slow, cautious combat of the *Dark Souls* series;  
  \- The quick, flashy combat of the *Dynasty Warriors* and (rebooted) *Ninja Gaiden* series\*; and  
  \- The endless equipment-effect combinations of the *Diablo* series\*.

  I personally think that the game's levels are a little *too* maze-like. Still, I can't complain about the combat, after beating the campaign and nearly all the optional missions.  (50&nbsp;$&nbsp;&divide;&nbsp;80&nbsp;h&nbsp;= good value, and I haven't even attempted the DLC or gotten very far into into New Game Plus yet.) The sheer quantity of equipment gets to be a little annoying&mdash;but at least the player can exchange his unwanted items for a currency that (*inter alia*) unlocks character skins, from the alchemist antagonist to the blacksmith waifu!

  \*Though I have no personal experience with any *Diablo* game, I *did* play a lot of the similar game [*Fate*](http://store.steampowered.com/app/246840), many years ago. Likewise, I haven't played any main-line *Dynasty Warriors* games, but I *do* have extensive experience with the first three *[Dynasty Warriors: Gundam](https://www.gamefaqs.com/search?game=dynasty+warriors+gundam)* games.

  Reminder: [*GURPS*](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/details.html), the Generic Universal RolePlaying System, is [**ludicrously awesome**](https://i.imgur.com/i1FhD43.jpg)&mdash;and DRM-free, too!  
  \- [*GURPS Space*](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/Space/): Use a 10-step process to generate (or design) an alien species! Use a 14-step process to generate (or design) a planet or moon!! Use [a 25-step process](https://i.imgur.com/imxm3IU.png) to generate (or design) a star system (including planets and moons)&mdash;matched to a planet or moon that you already generated (or designed), or completely from scratch!!! (If some of those page numbers look too close together, it's because the star-system-generation process refers back to some steps from the planet-/moon-generation process.) The cost is $25.  
  \- [*GURPS Spaceships*](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/spaceships/): Pick components to design a spaceship or a space station! *[Spaceships 1](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/spaceships/spaceships1/)*, the base book, costs $11. *Spaceships [4](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/spaceships/spaceships4/)* and *[7](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/spaceships/spaceships7/)* (each $8), plus [*Pyramid 3-34*](http://www.warehouse23.com/products/SJG37-2634) ($8) and maybe some other scattered [*Pyramid*](http://www.sjgames.com/pyramid/) issues with which I'm not acquainted, add more design options, from giant robots to ordinary buildings.  
  \- [*GURPS Vehicles*](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/Vehicles/): The older, cooler brother of *GURPS Spaceships*! Pick components from zillions of tables to design a vehicle of any kind!! The cost is $15 for the base book, plus $3 for each of *Vehicles Expansion [1](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/vehiclesexpansion1/)* and *[2](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/vehiclesexpansion2/)*. These books are cheap in comparison to *Spaceships* because they were written for the previous edition of *GURPS* (though converting Third-Edition vehicles to the current, Fourth Edition isn't hard at all) and because they're [infamous](https://i.imgur.com/MMqxWta.png) for their [cumbersome procedures](https://i.imgur.com/myyn0pI.png) (as befits the incredible breadth and depth of their coverage).  
  \- [*GURPS Social Engineering: Back to School*](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/backtoschool/): If you're tired of arbitrarily-bestowed "experience points", this book offers detailed rules for advancement based on *actual training and study*! The cost is $8.

  I've never actually played *GURPS*, beyond [a single abortive attempt at GMing](https://www.dropbox.com/s/x2jnfk7yb4yxsyt/ToaKraka%27s%20old%20attempt%20at%20GURPS%20Naruto%20-%20General%20Notes.pdf?dl=0) (note that I didn't bother to include [the 55-dollar *Basic Set*](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/Basic/), which is necessary for play, in the introductory recommendations listed above), but I have a *thorough* appreciation for its *incredible* awesomeness. [The books are exhaustively researched](https://i.imgur.com/yWilcbt.png), and you even can peruse [their bibliographies](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/biblios.html), which include both non-fiction and fiction!

    I can second the usefulness of GURPS. I haven't used most of the books mentioned in this post, but I *love* GURPS Space, which has been tremendously useful for me.

    I'm not a fan of Dark Souls but I loved Bloodborne. Would you still recommend this to me?
    ```

    - u/Mingablo:
      ```
      Nioh is faster than darksouls but slower than bloodborne. The biggest issue I have is that I am about 2/3rds of the way through and trash mobs can 2 or 3 hit me. It really sucks because your recovery time (from being hit) is longer than dark souls (if you get hit, you will continue to get hit until the end of the enemy combo. You can't really recover from stagger to dodge or block before the next hit comes). To counter this combos are harshly cut short. You and your enemies cannot chain attacks together until you run out of stamina. Each combo has a set number of attacks in it and there is an enforced break after your combo is. That being said I have no other gripes with the game and I Am still playing it. I love both dark souls and bloodborne.
      ```

    - u/ToaKraka:
      ```
      I haven't played *Bloodborne* (though I've watched a fair amount of it), but it's my impression that *Nioh* allows *both* the *Dark Souls* playstyle (blocking and dodging in medium armor or blocking and tanking in heavy armor) *and* the *Bloodborne* playstyle (parrying and dodging in light armor).

    I've been playing a GURPS game on a mostly-weekly basis with the same guys for like 5 years, now.  It's remarkably deep, but you can wade in slowly.

    It has let us run a couple long high magic fantasy campaigns, as well as many shorter stories in other settings - sci fi, post-apocalypse stone age, modern eldritch horror, and one sci fi/fantasy hybrid that felt a lot like Shadowrun set on a fantasy world instead of Earth.

    But a word of warning, only use the rules you find interesting.  A story about an emergency survival situation you should track food, meals, FP loss, poor sleep, HT rolls to not get sick... in that story, it is the crux of the story.  If you're magical heroes battling dragons, on the other hand, the story hinges more on combat and the rules on eating and sleeping can be handwaved.

    Unless you're doing an emergency survival situation story in that high magic setting for a session, then you use those rules and they integrate with the rules you were using for combat, and being tired, cold, or hungry makes the next fight that much more difficult.

    GURPS is wonderful.

  In another thread I recommended the Jane the Virgin TV series to anyone looking for "rational" drama or romance - it's on netflix and it's really good. 

  It's got a ridiculous premise (young virgin woman saving herself for marriage is accidentally artificially inseminated during a pelvic exam), and it's in the style of a telenovela so it's ridiculous in general (lots of evil twins, people disguising themselves perfectly as others, etc), but within those constraints it is really rational *especially with interpersonal relationships* - the mother/daughter relationship shown is very rational, romances start, stop and fade for "rational" reasons, there's absolutely ZERO "let me explain" type of shenanigans. 

  It is also absolutely hilarious and very clever.
  ```

  - u/GlueBoy:
    ```
    Just watched the first episode. It was good!

    edit: [spoilers](#s "I'm still enjoying it, but it's something you have to turn your brain off really. It's kind of pissing me off how so many things are ignored in order to move the plot. They use the guy's last semen sample to do a procedure with 20% sucess rate instead of In vitro fertilisation. The doctor breaks HIPPA and tells everyone jane's identity after her fuck up. The cop guy has a huge conflict of interest and stays on the case.")
    ```

    - u/MagicWeasel:
      ```
      In response to the spoiler: yeah, a lot of the actual plot is not Rational, but the *characters* are. You just have to go with the TV Law, TV police work, TV medicine.

      I probably oversold its rationality though now I actually think about all the liberties they take... but for me the show is about the characters and those are done rationally... so yeah.

  I tentatively recommend the [World of Prime ](https://www.goodreads.com/series/129874-world-of-prime) series of books.

  They start off a standard portal fantasy uplift; more specifically, guy is somehow taken from our world to another (fantasy-type) world. By coincidence, he happens to have sufficient knowledge to attempt to introduce rifles to this medieval type world. There are enough twists to keep it interesting. And no harem. 

  Plot is interesting enough, and the writing is very competent, but what I really liked was the worldbuilding.  

  Mild spoilers: 

  The magic works by a sort of cannibalism. Every sentient being and some animals produce a substance in their brains, called tael, which confer powers after eating a certain number. So if you eat the average output of 16 dead humans it gives you the first rank, then another 32 gives you the second rank, and so on. (it's not specified if it keeps duplicating like that or not, but higher ranks are implied to be very, very expensive. Tael is treated as currency, and ranks are treated as, well, social, military, organizational rank. 

  These ranks of power can be used for lots of different things. If you're a priest, it allows you to select a certain number of spells from your chosen deity a day. If you're a warrior, it gives you strength and durability and some minor combat spells. There are even craftsman specific ranks, like alchemist, blacksmith, and so on, each with their own unique spells.

    Ok. Now I'm half way through book 3. 
    I really like it.
    It tries to make a consistent setting with D&D framework. It has its share of glorious HFY battles and I can affirm I like it.
    ```

  - u/hoja_nasredin:
    ```
    started reading it. Let's see how it goes. So far it is 1 or 2 ed of D&D. Hoe to see more magical animals and battles. It's incredibly slowly so far.

    I'm not sure if he plans to equip all his army with guns, but low level guns are inferior to crossbows in every aspect... Also I dislike his source of confrontation "I looked at this guys and instantly knew I hated him". It feels shallows, antagonists for the sake of antagonists.

    Does the books pic up the pace?
    ```

- u/Jetrie:
  ```
  So I’m hoping that anyone here has any recommendations for any fiction involving language. More specifically the problems with different ones.

  Things I have seen which demonstrate what I’m talking about. Sort of...

  The 13th warrior ( or alt the Eater of the Dead novel)
  Portions of the Last Samurai and Dances with wolves. ( minus the white savior trope)

  I just find the overcoming differences in language and cultural expectations very interesting and wish it was reflected more in fiction I read.

  Any help would be greatly appreciated!!

  - u/MagicWeasel:
    ```
    Speaker for the Dead has this in it a bit, strongest novel in the Ender series IMO (I will probably be flamed for this but WHATEVER GUYS). 

    You might also like the Crystal Society trilogy (though the third book isn't out yet). The first book is available online for free and has a lot of stuff like that.

    EDIT: Also, Three Worlds Collide by Yudkowsky might fit what you're looking for. It's more like Speaker for the Dead than like Story of Your Life, which would have been my first recommendation but someone beat me to it!

  * [Battle Action Harem Highschool Side Character Quest (No SV, you are the Waifu)](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/battle-action-harem-highschool-side-character-quest-no-sv-you-are-the-waifu.15335/) - A great quest where you are the member of an harem rather than being the harem protagonist. However it veers more towards the [Real Robot Genre](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealRobotGenre) than the [Harem Genre](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HaremGenre). If anyone knows of similar stories where the main character is a member of an harem as well, I would be interested in reading them.

  * [White Collar Cultivator](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/white-collar-cultivator.44460/#post-9900763) - It's an interesting story that just very recently started which can be summed up as *The Interdimensional Archival Clerk Position I Was Enslaved To Is Surprisingly Cushy, Despite The Risk Of Death And Dismemberment*.

  * [Ceaseless Flow](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/percy-jackson-the-dresden-files-ceaseless-flow.407257/) - It's a Dresden/Percy Jackson crossover that Ryuugi started a while ago and is now updating again recently.

  * [Prytaneum](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/danmachi-percy-jackson-prytaneum.352191/) - It's a Danmachi/Percy Jackson crossover that Ryuugi started a while ago and is now updating again recently.

  * [Prequel](http://www.prequeladventure.com/) - It's a webcomic set in Skyrim about a khajit who sorta fumbles her way through life and has to exert truly heroic amounts of effort just to break even. Many inspiring moments interspersed with face-palming worthy moments. Just resumed after a lengthy hiatus again.

  I have more stories that I can recommend, but my problem is that there's too many. So if anyone wants to help me narrow it down by asking me for a specific fandom, or some sort of more specific request about the type of stories/tropes, I'll be happy to rec.

  I recently discovered [Nature of Nature's art](http://www.nofna.com/index.php?chapter=10%251), a series of webcomic graphic novels drawn with the Paint BBS oekaki. The stories all take place in a shared alternate earth where animals of all kinds mysteriously gain "halo brains", and gain sapience, and each of the stories centers around individuals trying to build and understand what society is, often through the medium of creating art. Plus the action scenes are clearly inspired by shounen manga.

  It's not perfect, falling into the common trap of far out sci-fi of often making things overly confusing to a newcomer, but I still loved the passion and the story.

  I've finished re-reading Greyjoy Alle Breve, probably my favorite isekai/self-insert fanfiction works, and I'm just utterly blown away by how solid the new world the story develops into. It's a wonderful blend of the historical Westerosi attitudes with the inspired desire to innovate the SI has spread. With a majority of the story told from other viewpoints, and the SI not being the exclusive innovator, and even his enemies seeing the power of innovation, it's a far more realistic depiction of an uplift technological revolution than many other uplift stories I've read.

  So my request is, is there any other isekai/uplift stories out there where the actual displaced individual isn't the POV character, or at least not the only primary one? I'd also love uplift stories in something isn't the generic feudal faux-european or Tolkienesque world.

    A few months ago someone recommended [Paths of Civilization](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/paths-of-civilization.36410/) which seems exactly what you're looking for, besides not being an isekai and not having MC at all. It's a quest (kind of like a cooperative choose-your-own-adventure story where readers pick what happens from chapter to chapter) that focuses on the development of a civilization starting from stone age nomads. The POV changes frequently, from chiefs and shamans to ordinary farmers and warriors. It's pretty good.

    I like the genre, but I can't really point at any book that I've read that is particularly great. They all seem to end up being power fantasies featuring a Gary Stu MC. A rational take on the genre would be awesome. Even just one that flips common tropes, like having a female MC or the MC failing to introduce guns. 

    Anyway, here's some that I remember reading:

    [World of Prime series](https://www.goodreads.com/series/129874-world-of-prime) | 7.5/10 | Recommended elsewhere in this thread. Good so far. 

    [Destiny's Crucible Series](https://www.goodreads.com/series/215776-destiny-s-crucible) | 7/10 | The last book was pretty disappointing. Sometimes it seems that authors forget why people like a particular genre. In this case, the author focused to much on the antagonists and not enough on the tech and development of the island. I want to watch this guy playing civ IRL, not read 300k words on troop maneuvers and shit. And the epilogue was a travesty. Still, it's passable if you get them cheap and have a dearth of books to read.   

    [Conrad Stargard series](https://www.goodreads.com/series/43333-conrad-stargard) | 6/10 | The MC is a Gary Stu, as always in these books, and the first few are interesting. By the 5th book they get lost in these weird tangents and fantasies by the author. Like, a rotating harem featuring every female in the book, pretty much, and the MC being worshipped as god emperor(a bit of exaggeration, but not much). I never finished the 5th book, but I have read summaries of the sequels and they apparently get pretty dumb.


    [Daniel Black series](https://www.goodreads.com/series/144936-daniel-black) | 8/10 | These books are the literary equivalent of deep fried twinkies. Pure, unabashed junk food reading. The MC is a rather bland reader stand-in(male equivelant of Bella Swan from twilight, I guess) and every female with a line of dialogue wants to get on his dick, [which he valiantly demurs on](https://pics.me.me/begone-thot-18089971.png), in favour of staying faithful to his (literal) harem. 

    I still enjoy seeing him build stuff and wreck shit with magic.
