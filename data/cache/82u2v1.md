## [Challenge Companion] Meditation

### Post:

**tl;dr: This is the companion to [the biweekly writing challenge](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/82u2ei/biweekly_challenge_meditation/), post anything relevant that's not actually an entry here (e.g. ideas, recommendations, idle thoughts).**

Apologies for the lateness of the challenge and sparseness of this post, just got home from a family trip.

  So, now that you've exposed your secondary account, are you going to stop posting to these challenges, post under a different pseudonym, or just post using either of your account and assume people aren't going to be biased?

    I have other accounts, and will probably use them, but I think the new strategy will be to just "burn" individual accounts immediately after the challenge is over rather than allowing them to have continuous identities. I don't tend to write a story for the challenge unless there's something that really grabs my attention away from other projects, or I'm not working on anything with an explicit/implicit deadline.

    (Part of my process for deciding on a challenge is seeing whether I can think of at least three good story ideas in a short period of time, and one of the risks to that is that I might stumble on something that it seems like I need to write to get out of my system.)

    (There are currently six drafts in my Challenges folder that have enough meat on them that I want to finish them at some point, and another thirteen that are mostly bones and sketches. It's fairly common for me to start but not finish a story, especially for challenges, where I'm more comfortable walking into things half-baked.)
