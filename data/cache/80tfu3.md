  Something is tickling my brain, and I can't tell if I'm missing something or if I'm nitpicking.

  In chapter 68, Cat rips the scaffolding off her soul and goes full Winter. It's written to be a huge, dramatic move. See here:

  >Winter was no longer a thing tamed. It ran wild through my veins, through my Name, and a scream ripped its way out of me. My blood was red ice, my bones snapped and beyond it all my heart beat once – and ceased... Winter had taken it all and left nothing behind that would warm me, no refuge to reassure me that I was still Catherine Foundling.

  She seemingly has a major personality shift along with new powers, kills Ubua, and in the beginning of the next chapter, she freaks out Vivienne. But then her conversation with Malicia and Black is... practically the same as old Catherine? She gets mad, she mentally discusses her love for Black, she puts Callow first... but she doesn't seem like the preternatural, "above all of it," ice-hearted fae creature she should be and was for 1/3 of a chapter.

  Same in this chapter. Her conversation with Juniper, even her internal monologuing, all sounds exactly like old Cat to me. She still feels sympathy, takes her oaths seriously, hesitates, and even gives a Callowan oath. Winter (fae-style) doesn't even get mentioned, nor does cold, or ice. Despite her blood "turning to red ice" two chapters before, she cuts herself and bleeds like normal with no mention of this change.

  If we cut out the parts about her going full Winter, I really would see no difference between how the old Cat acted and how Winter Cat is acting. But I really expect to - it was a big change, right?

  So am I missing something in the dialogue, like her mannerisms changed somehow (besides reacquiring a limp) or her personality being subtly off? Or maybe was it not actually as big a change as I expected it to be? Or, and I hate to suggest this because I really like this series... is it just a weakness in the writing?

    Black may have stopped her transition in progress
    ```

    - u/AurelianoTampa:
      ```
      I mean, he did... but she was acting normal even before then. There are some Winter mentions in the convo with Black and Malicia, and I feel like Cat was a little off her normal tempo there... but I don't see why stopping her Name transition would make Winter suddenly disappear. Especially when it had practically shaken loose the Squire Name anyway.

      I'll say, I DO expect that the Winter change will be addressed in an upcoming chapter. I'm just saying that right now it feels like it was supposed to fundamentally alter the character... but it hasn't. I worry it won't until it's the focus of the chapter, when I feel like good writing would have it subtly infuse everything Cat does *until* it gets directly addressed.
      ```

- u/haiku_fornification:
  ```
  Black's coma is probably caused by his Name - a more advanced version of what happened when Cat let The Lone Swordsman go. In a way, while betraying the Tyrant is perfectly in-line with the Black Knight's Role, destroying an evil super-weapon is definitely not. 

  I'm surprised Cat is able to bleed after accepting her Winter power in full. Wasn't her blood made out of ice? I'm still hoping a new Name will present itself. Cat's ability to maneuver the story is game changing and I don't think she'll be able to do so much as Winter fae with a husk of a Squire in her.
  ```

  - u/Rheklr:
    ```
    I suspect Black stopped her transition to the Black Queen, and now with Procer bearing down she'll end up with a different name.

    Alternatively, I could see Cat never transitioning at all. To take up a proper role gives more power but it does narrow what you can do, and for someone whose endgame will probably be going after the gods themselves that sounds too limiting.
    ```

- u/M3mentoMori:
  ```
  Daoine gets their gestalt back thanks to Cat, Juniper now leads Callow's military, and Cat is on the cusp of open rebellion. Reverb indeed.

  Kinda wish we'd seen a resolution to the events of last chapter, beyond a mention of Black's coma and the Tower's silence, but setup is important, I guess.

  Unrelated: does anyone know if EE announces when a chapter is the last in a Book? I feel like we're very, very close.
  ```

  - u/ErraticErrata:
    ```
    I usually announce it in the comments and put a reminder up on the front page (though since a book's last chapter is always titled Epilogue, it's usually pretty obvious).
    ```

    - u/M3mentoMori:
      ```
      Awesome, thanks!

      While I have your attention, do you have a pronunciation guide for PGTE? Most things are pretty simple to figure out, but stuff like Ater or Wekesa leave me wondering if I'm saying them correctly.
      ```

      - u/sharikak54:
        ```
        I agree.  I had no idea Masego was pronounced with a hard "z" sound until we heard him called "Zeze".  I was pronouncing it like the Japanese word for fish eggs...
        ```

      - u/ErraticErrata:
        ```
        I never sat down and made one, no. Though if you want to approach it from my point of view, keep in mind French is my native tongue and that tends to influence my pronunciation.
        ```

    - u/Ardvarkeating101:
      ```
      Do you just always lurk here and only answer technical questions?
      ```

      - u/ErraticErrata:
        ```
        I don't usually chime in unless asked a direct question, but I do keep an eye on comments yeah.
        ```

        - u/Ardvarkeating101:
          ```
          What's watching the speculation like?
          ```

          - u/ErraticErrata:
            ```
            Mostly amusing, occasionally a good gauge about whether or not a development was predictable.
            ```

- u/werafdsaew:
  ```
  So who betrayed General Istrid?  Juniper ruled out Sacker, and we saw no hint of betrayal in Ranker's interlude.  So if it's not goblin conspiracy, then that left Malicia and Procer.

  However I think Cat missed an obvious culprit: Black.  Purging his most loyal followers to make way for Catherine's would be exactly the kind of thing he would do, especially since he thinks that he doesn't have much time left.

  Continuing this thought, maybe he's only pretending to be in a coma for the same reason.
  ```

  - u/Flamesmcgee:
    ```
    I like Malicia better for it. Black was going to need some convincing on the topic of nukes; if he thinks there's any chance the legion can hold the Vale, he's never going to agree keeping the superweapon, for all the stated reasons. Thus, Malicia has an interest in weakening the legions, first by sending them into Akua's grinder right before Procer invades, and second by culling the top Marshals.

    What was Malicia's plan for using the superweapon though? I thought it needed Akua's Bind to control the devils?
    ```

    - u/GeeJo:
      ```
      The Binding was useful for when the weapon was being used defensively in close proximity to Diabolist's own forces. Who needs to control the devils when you've opened the rift half a continent away from you in the enemy's heartland?
      ```

      - u/WalterTFD:
        ```
        Greater Rifts...DON"T CLOSE.  If you open one, anywhere, you will eventually flood the world with devils.  Not having bindings worked into the rift to control anything that comes out would be the height of irresponsibility.
        ```

        - u/melmonella:
          ```
          Eh a hero would close it eventually. Just make sure they don't go after you after closing it.
          ```

  - u/AurelianoTampa:
    ```
    > Purging his most loyal followers to make way for Catherine's would be exactly the kind of thing he would do

    Eh... he's got contingency plans for the Calamities, sure, because we know that Warlock, Scribe, and (likely) Assassin would go after Cat. But I don't think he'd kill Istrid. Her daughter leads Cat's legion, and while Istrid was a huge Black loyalist, I always had the impression that it was more because of what he made of the Legions (and orcs) than following him reverently. If Black told her to follow Cat if he died, I think she'd have done it.

    Not to mention that if Black was going to start purging, I doubt he'd leave the goblin leaders alive...
    ```

    - u/werafdsaew:
      ```
      Istrid has no personal loyalty to Cat, and might decide to side with Malicia against Cat when Black is gone, and that's why she has to go.

      Goblins are untouched because they have a different understanding of loyalty and will follow Cat when it seems like that is the more advantageous thing to do.
      ```

- u/drakeblood4:
  ```
  So the fact that Procer completely outguns Callow means Cat is 100% winning the coming fight, right? Narrative rules demand it.
  ```

  - u/Flamesmcgee:
    ```
    Didn't White Knight alternate Cat have the bumbling conjurer collapse the mountain on top of the Vale? I feel like that solution is good enough.
    ```

    - u/sparr:
      ```
      Sure, but that was after years of strong advancement for the "no longer bumbling"(?) conjurer.
      ```

      - u/Mgmtheo:
        ```
        Cat has Heirophant, Legion engineers, and goblinfire, she can make it work.
        ```

  - u/GeeJo:
    ```
    Given how splendidly her management of the kingdom is going thus far, maybe she gets cast in the role of the buffoonish petty tyrant who gets steamrolled on the way to the real villain.
    ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    well she is not technically the squire anymore since winter devoured her name, or at least most of it.
    ```

- u/HallowedThoughts:
  ```
  Well this is certainly exciting. I'm glad Istrid's death is an important point here, and I would love to see more of the Matrons and get them involved. Hopefully we see Cat's transition soon, unless it's Warlord (although that should be impossible)
  ```

- u/paradoxinclination:
  ```
  Huh, so Black's in a coma. I suppose that's one way to side-step the issue of what exactly Cat and Malicia are going to do with him after all this. I'm very interested in what exactly Cat's new Name is going to be after this giant cluster-fuck.
  ```

  - u/sitsthewind:
    ```
    Not just Cat; I wonder if *Black* will get a new Name. This felt like a pivot for him as well - he's been preparing for "retirement" (Cat), he's recently dealt with the death of one of his oldest friends (Captain), he's broken with another (Malicia), and who knows what the deal with Assassin was. That would explain Bard's presence as well.
    ```

- u/sparkc:
  ```
  I wonder if Cat’s oath to Juniper will come back to bite her in the ass when/if the person behind Istrids death is revealed to Cat as someone that’s politically inconvenient to go after.
  ```
