  So for someone who's full knowledge of FTL comes from [Door Monster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVHw5Hcat9s), would I appreciate this? 

  Also, should I get FTL?

    FTL is an amazing game. It has a stupid amount of depth and replayability.

    It's a tactical roguelite and I can't recommend it blindly to anyone, but it is an incredibly well-crafted and polished game. It's fun because almost every time, when you die it was actually your fault. Losses can almost always be traced down to your own mistakes of mismanaging resources, being too greedy or prioritizing wrong upgrades. The underlying mechanics are clean and simple, but the depth which emerges from having to juggle and consider everything gives it an incredibly high skill ceiling.

    Even a hundred hours in, it's not difficult to come across minor tricks and gimmicks which can give you a slight edge on any given fight, like intentionally disabling your shields mid-fight for a split-second to let an ion blast through and have it disrupt a less critical subsystem instead of the shields.

      I’ve never played any roguelites before, but I’ll give it a try, when it goes on sale. Steam reviews seem to agree with you, thanks for the rec.

        While I don't recommend using them at first the mods do give the game even more replayability. I'm just mentioning it because I regularly come across people who've enjoyed the game who don't know that it's moddable.

        http://subsetgames.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=26619 is a good mod list

    So accurate! Control of the doors really is OP.

    > Also, should I get FTL?

    ... yes! Well, read some reviews first, and make sure it is the kind of thing you'd enjoy, but then yes!

    I don't think any knowledge of FTL is necessary. It's just a solidly decent story set in a sci-fi future. Granted, I'm an FTL fan myself, but it does seem self-contained best I can tell.

  Is this your writing, OP? I'm really enjoying it. The little touches about alien culture and psychology really help make the world feel real--the early scene with Kat and the psych unit was one of the main things that hooked me initially, and I'm also a big fan of the engi having gone out of their way to engineer an intoxicant just so they could bond with other species in that way. And I became emotionally invested in the friendship(?) between Brant and 78 almost immediately.
  ```

  - u/Pondincherry:
    ```
    No, not mine. I totally agree with you, though. That's a big part of why I posted it here--it does a great job of making the aliens feel alien in a consistent manner, and everybody feels like a real person.
    ```

  ```
  I second the recomendation.

  Only up to chapter 11... but it's really good so far: the author manages to make each race distinctive without making them caricatures, and each caracter feels like theyhave depth. Probably helped that it ticks most of my favorite tropes, but the tempo and writting are far far superior to your average fanfic. Saying anything more would be redundant since you get the picture, go read it you'll love it.
