## 2014 Hugos?

### Post:

Just curious if there's any WorldCon members here this year. Final day to get in your nominations is March 10th. Anyone nominating Rational or Rationalist works? I'm nominating a few, both because I think they're great and deserve it, and because I think it might help the genre a bit.

  A long time ago, someone somewhere said "Hey Eliezer, do you think you might submit HPMoR for a 2012 Hugo?" and I replied "Ah, so you're an optimist." And now here we are and it's going to be put off a whole extra year because it's *four days* too late!

    If I'm not mistaken, I think the Hugos that are being given out at the moment are for works that were released during the year of 2014. Since HPMOR just concluded, it would be more applicable next year.

    I was surprised to see this: "Works do not have to be published in a “professional” publication (as defined here) to be eligible for a Hugo Award."

    I'm not sure if there are any formal rules for fanfiction, but that rule might allow HPMOR to be eligible for Best Novel. There *is* a best Fan Writer category, which seems even more applicable.

      Yup, it'll be up for 2015. I'll be making a push for it, and I have little doubt we can make it on the ballot. If the Sad Puppies can do it, no reason we can't.

      Online self-published works have gotten nominations before - Seanan McGuire has an *extremely* loyal fan base. However HPMoR  will be the first time that's been done for a novel, I believe.

      2015's Hugos are gonna be awesome. :)

      Ah, yeah, if I'd thought for two seconds about "2014 Hugos" I'd've at least looked that up.

      Next year would also give him the time to make a few edits and make it even better.
