## [D] Monday General Rationality Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics!  Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world?  Have you:

* Seen something interesting on /r/science?
* Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
* Figured out how to become immortal?
* Constructed artificial general intelligence?
* Read a neat nonfiction book?
* Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?

  So I've been looking into designing a tabletop card game lately and I'm curious about what the /r/rational community thinks make good aspects of game design. A recent trend I've seen in gaming has been towards the extremely complex which I've enjoyed because it's a departure from the overly simplistic boardgames I grew up with like Monopoly where there isn't as much way to play the game mechanically consistently and succeed as a result.

  The general model I'm looking at is a 1v4 game in which one player is making all the decisions for the dungeon that the larger party is exploring. Drawing from a single resource mana pool, the dungeon creates new rooms, spawns monsters, and tries to kill the invaders by modifying the monsters with evolution cards and equipping them with loot that the adventurers can steal.

  The adventuring party on the other hand has a mechanic for fostering conflict within the party. Each player draws three secret goal cards that can affect party play and is competing to be the first to finish those goals and escape the dungeon. Some examples of this are things along the lines of
  Plague in your village: Escape the dungeon with three health potions to treat the epidemic affecting your village.
  Avenge your family: Kill five of the hideous goblins that murdered your family.

  Would this be the sort of thing that would interest you in a card game? If not then what suggestions for improving gameplay or mechanics would you propose? I'm interested in seeing what you all think!

    It’s a neat idea, kind of reminds me of Munchkin, but you need to avoid the same pitfalls as that game did. It’s fun the first few times, but you eventually get bored of how it always devolves into all the other players screwing over the one who’s closest to victory until they run out of cards.

    The immediate question I have is why players would keep their goals a secret for each other? It’s not like they wouldn’t want any help with their objectives. If it’s more interesting when they keep secrets, you need to incentivize that behavior. Competitive co-op has been done well before, I suggest looking into examples.

    I’ve heard the Bloodborne card game pulls it off well and there are subreddits dedicated to board game design that you can ask around.
    ```

    - u/MistahTimn:

      Yeah I've definitely taken a lot of inspiration from Munchkin in the way that the adventurers develop and become more powerful. The idea itself came out of reading The Bound Dungeon and realizing that games dealing with dungeon management haven't ever really done the idea justice.

      I think the secretive nature of the goals would actually add a lot to the competitiveness. Originally when I was thinking about it, it was just going to be the dungeon versus the adventurers, but I realized that wouldn't really make for as much fun from a competitive standpoint. A lot of the goal cards I have in mind will be things that are counterproductive to effective party play. For instance, collecting potions and trying to escape with them limits the amount of healing for everyone in the group and could cause intense conflict when everyone knows that you have been drawing a lot from the consumables treasure pile, but are refusing to help someone for whatever reason. Also, I think I'm going to make it so that only half of the adventurers can leave the dungeon or that there's a turn limit to escaping so that it will add tension to escaping. 

      I've also toyed with the idea of allowing people to draw more goal cards and assigning each one a point value, but I don't know if that would add more to the mechanic or just be an unnecessary complication.
      ```

      - u/trekie140:
        ```
        My quick and dirty idea for how to encourage keeping goals a secret is that the reward for completing them has to be shared by everyone who helped.
        ```

        - u/ulyssessword:
          ```
          Ooh, I *like* that.  That would change it from "goals" to "bonus points" though.  

          Taking a healing potion out of the dungeon could be worth +100 points for anyone but only one player knows that and could trade other players to get it.  Killing the Goblin King gets you a Vorpal Sword, but only one person knows that as well, and can seek him out for a better chance of the equipment.
          ```

    - u/CCC_037:
      ```
      > The immediate question I have is why players would keep their goals a secret for each other?

      The simplest way to ensure this is to make some of the goals distinctly anti-social (example - the player on your right once stole your drink at a bar. Your aim is to ensure that he does not leave the dungeon alive.)

      People who get such goals have strong incentive to lie about their goals, making such information unreliable at best.
      ```

      - u/MistahTimn:
        ```
        Further down the line, like if I release the game and also release expansions, I want to make goal decks specific to the different adventurer classes. For instance, the Thief class might have a goal card that says that you want to murder another member of a party, but that would be completely out of character and setting for the Healer class. The support role classes especially are the ones I'm having difficulty balancing because they need efficient party play to work which is exactly what I'm trying to discourage.
        ```

        - u/CCC_037:
          ```
          Healer might need to steal some valuable resource to cure a plague. (Like healing potions). There might be another role (like Con Man) which can convincingly fake being a Healer.
          ```

          - u/MistahTimn:
            ```
            That raises an interesting idea of how keeping your class secret could be played. It could be a really interesting dynamic, but I think it would be extremely difficult from a design standpoint to make the adventurer's decks generic enough that people wouldn't instantly guess your class when you play a card.
            ```

            - u/CCC_037:
              ```
              If you have individual class goals, then you need secret classes - or else knowing someone's class tells you something about their goals.

              It might be that all the decks have similar cards, but the difference is in the frequency - e.g.the Thief deck contains a dozen Steal cards and one Heal, while the Healer's deck contains no Steal and a dozen Heals.

    Avid boardgamer here. 

    The overlord mechanic is a common one (Descent etc) but unfortunately it translates very badly into fun. Someone has to play the Dungeon Master; this means extra rules, an extra playstyle someone has to learn, it removes the DM player from the other players - in my group we've always had trouble even finding a DM! An easily exectuable ranomization mechanism like drawing from a deck that still provides adequate difficulty is hard, but worth it. 

    My No. 1 Rule of boardgame design is crispness. Clean rules. Its very tempting to add a thousand extra rules and exceptions to your game, eg. for simulation purposes, but ultimately they distract from the game. Someone has to remember them or look them up. 

    2) Having good tooltips and design conducive to gameplay are a huge part of learning the game. I always reference Vlaada Chvatil games from Chzech Boardgame Edition for this. In "Galaxy Trucker" you build spaceships from a multitude of parts. The function of the part can at least partially derived/described by its form/colour. 

    https://imgur.com/a/sgcTx 

    If its green, it uses energy, If its brown, it has to do with engines, if its pink its doing something with weapons. There are extra cards for each round you put on the board. Reminders of the most common events printed everywhere etc. 

    Or take "Galaxy Trucker" - they basically invent a whole new symbolic language that serves as a reminder. http://www.pixelpark.co.nz/images/categories/RaceGalaxy980.jpg No text on most cards! And on the cards where they do something new and use non-standard symbols, in the very low right corner an explanation text.

    Even just printing cards for each person with the turn order and on the back the available actions is worth a lot. 

     *ahem* I have strong opinions on boardgame design.

      I appreciate the mechanical advice! That's definitely the area I'm least competent in. I've been consulting with a friend who is super interested in game theory and bouncing ideas off of him, but the more people I talk to the more refined the ideas get!

      The issue that I have with a randomization element is that it takes away a lot of the intelligent opposition factor from gameplay. My example for this would be Sentinels of the Multiverse. On he surface it seems like an interesting game, but it quickly becomes very stale because of the limitation imposed by there being no shifting and evolving strategy because the opponent is fixed in the ways that they respond. I think what sets my idea apart from some of the other overlord style games is that the conflict won't only be Dungeon vs. Adventurers, but also Adventurers vs. Adventurers which could incentivize some interesting behavior from the dungeon player. 

      It's definitely feasible that playing the Dungeon will be something that not as many people will be interested in, but I think it's also necessary to have an intelligent opponent trying to divide the group. One of the ways I want to keep the dungeon side of gameplay both crisp and interesting is by having there only be one resource pool to draw from, but a variety of choices to make in how you grow that resource pool.

      The mana pool will dictate everything about what the dungeon can buy: rooms, monsters, and modifications, but it will also grow depending on what each set of players does. Whenever a monster is killed, the mana cost of the monster will be completely refunded to the dungeon minus whatever evolutionary mods have been put on it, but for every turn it remains alive, the dungeon gets half the base mana cost back. So the adventuring party is incentivized to kill the monsters as fast as possible to prevent the dungeon from building up to much mana. Also, certain rooms would have mana pools that also add to mana production to make another type of key room.

      In regards to the card design, I completely agree. The design needs to be as crisp and intuitive as the gameplay is. I think by sticking to the theme, hopefully the gameplay will be fairly easily understood. There's a couple graphic designers I know who I've been talking to about card design that I may end up pulling onto this project should it end up going anywhere.
      ```

      - u/ulyssessword:
        ```
        Would it work to have the overlord role filled by the players on a turn-by-turn basis?  If they're sufficiently restricted to a set of semi-random choices, sabotage and help could be played off as "luck".
        ```

  - u/SvalbardCaretaker:
    ```
    PS: if you mean 1v4 gaming literally, this will be unplayable in many cases. You need to have the number of players be variable.
    ```

    - u/MistahTimn:
      ```
      In an ideal world it will be 1v4, but I'm not going to limit it to just that! I haven't decided on the balancing yet, but it could be any size adventuring party as long as I change the amount of starting resources the dungeon has at the beginning.
      ```

    ```
    I don't know if this is helpful, but the thing that makes Monopoly "complex" is the interactions between people. You're right in the fact that Monopoly, by itself, is quite simple. But when you add the human interaction and possible house rules on how trades and borrowing from the bank works you get all of the complexity of human trading and economics with very simple mechanics.

    With that idea, you could try going that route, much like Settlers of Catan, where the mechanics are very simple but the mechanics force human interaction and trading or negotiation, which ramps up the complexity immensely while keeping the act of learning the game vey easy and approachable.

  Today or tomorrow I will get an email informing me whether I have gotten a job and I'm afraid of what will happen if I do. It seems likely that I'll get it, they hired a classmate of mine with the same qualifications and are interested in recruiting a person with my skills, but I've gotten used to being lazy. I had so little luck finding work that I eventually stopped trying, so I've been lounging around for weeks looking for things to distract myself from the despair. 

  Then I heard about this job out of the blue and it's the best chance I've ever had, working a 12-hour shift on an assembly line 4 days a week. I've never done anything like that before and I don't know how I'll respond to cutting back on hedonism so much after so long. At the same time, though, I need this job both to maintain my financial solvency and prevent another depressive episode about my employability. I want the job, but I'm also dreading getting it.

  POLITICAL ANXIETY UPDATE

  I have managed to find a community/ideology that exemplifies everything I fear about modern politics, and it's **literally** called the [Dark Enlightenment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Enlightenment). That name wasn't given to them by academics describing them, they actually named their subreddit r/DarkEnlightenment and it has 12,000 subscribers.

  I knew racists, fascists, and anti-intellectuals like this existed, but I didn't know they were actually advertising themselves as the evil counterpart to the movement that gave us science, democracy, and civil rights. Since when did **The Dark Side** become something to aspire to? What the hell does this mean?

    Can we swap places?  I just got told today that expected revenue rises from new clients didn't materialize, so my contract's not getting renewed.

    I know I'm putting in PhD applications this season - *again* but with nice tutors to help make them great this time - but *goddamnit* joblessness *sucks*.  You don't get money each month, *and* you don't get a neat daily schedule, *and* you don't get to feel useful to other people from doing something focused every day.

    Think of them like Radical Inquisitors from Warhammer 40K, but *unironically*.  They think the goal of their political program is to protect the rest of us from the Things Man Was Not Meant to Know, and to guide their culture to glory and success by systematically indoctrinating it to follow something vaguely like the Imperial Cult.  Kinda.

    To make my own contribution, a civilization begins to fall when people take *sheer edginess* seriously as an ideology.

    Or maybe it doesn't.  At least by my standards, "Get out there and die for History/God/Country/Ideology" is pretty fucking edgy, but *everyone* seems to be into *that*.

    Seriously, though, they're *really fucking edgy*, often with some really negative personal experiences backing up the views.

      This is basically right, you'd be surprised how receptive people are to the dangers of democracy and progressivism, how much more eagerly they'll accept our views on the jewish question than you'd ever think. The internet is perfect for redpilling en-masse. You've already got people self-segregating by ideology, fandoms, etc, so it's easy to tailor specific messages to specific groups. I can semi-reliably redpill mainstream conservatives and libertarians on counter-semitism and race realism given what they think is an environment of civil debate, and leftists are generally very easy to convince that democracy is an abject failure, for example - just agree with them for the wrong reasons. The difference between us and our enemies is that any we recognise any ideological goals and principles can only reliably be accomplished after winning, so that should be the only non-negotiable principle, the sole hill to die on.

        [When I find myself nodding along to a *National Review* article, something horrible has happened and we are in a grim, dark timeline.](http://www.nationalreview.com/article/452684/alt-right-white-supremacism-left-right-conservatives-ta-nehisi-coates-ben-shapiro-federalist?utm_source=Facebook&utm_medium=Social&utm_campaign=McLaughlin)  Like, it honestly seems like we're in the grimdark AU fanfic of reality.  I'm really not sure how inciting a kind of civil war between ~65% of the population (self-identified "whites") and ~13% of the population (self-identified "blacks") is supposed to result in anything *useful* happening, *let alone* what the *fuck* these guys think they'll accomplish by also targeting 1.8% of the population (Jews).

        Thing being, the user you're talking to *always talks like that*, which is why he got banned from here.  On the other hand, he's the one "sitting on a giant pile of utility" while I'm just hoping the world will let me do *one fucking thing* I actually want in the meantime while civilization collapses, so he's probably telling some measure of the truth.

        On the gripping hand, he's *insane*.  Sure, history's moving in his insane direction, but that doesn't make his worldview *right*, it just means he's found a way to rationalize the direction of the wind.

Then, "he started referring to other users as having no intrinsic worth and to one user's sexual choices as basically degeneracy" (quoting myself).

            Emphasis on that first clause.  Lots of people have stupid, arbitrary criticisms of others' sexuality.  Start treating people as requiring a justification to be alive and get banned.

    IIRC they call themselves the *Dark* Enlightenment in direct contrast to the Enlightenment, which they think is a mistake and which they are trying to roll back. If it had been called the Endarkenment for some reason, then they'd be the Light Endarkenment, and if it had been the Doggishment, then they'd be the Catdoggishment.

        Eh, he's overestimating his own influence. Political groups do that a lot-- they ban all dissent, then take the lack of dissent as proof that they're popular. Yeah, they'll get the occasional convert, but they don't account for all the people who leave their ideology because, again, dissent is banned, so they don't realize it. And people *do* leave radical ideologies all the time-- look at how much the KKK has shrunk over the past few decades.
