  This was really good, and very convincingly terrifying.

  Well that was interesting.  I’m not sure if that is an ambiguous end or a dark end.  On one hand, he can chill with the locus, on the other that might be exactly what the scenario maker wants?  Given enough time to chill with the locus, it would eventually rule out the hell scenario, the Bethel torture scenario, and the delusion scenario.

  This brings up my worry about if the ending of Worth the Candle can satisfy the mystery boxes of the DM and game layer satisfactorily, but I think at the very least Alexanderwales would have a plan from the beginning... he’s not just going to JJ Abrams it.  Still I think it needs to avoid making the characters non-sentient constructs and avoid making the story event entirely superfluous while also addressing the constructed nature of the world and the DMs involvement.

    I'll put some money towards meta explanation and fourth wall break, seems like the kind of thing to end this long story

      If you operationalize fourth wall break, I'd probably take a bet about that.

        Something like the DM referencing the audience. Though now that I think about it it is quite hard to specifically define and I am less comfortable taking a bet that specifics will appear because I have far less confidence in how AW will present it than my confidence in it occurring at all.

          I'm also not willing to bet, but I could see it ending with the DM saying something like "You're me, Juniper. I know you know that part, but what you don't know is who I am. I'm an author, and you are my self-insert. I had some issues to work out. Thanks for helping."

  holy heck, great job on this - a really interesting concept told using an ambitious structure. Each individual bit of this story is surprising and entertaining, and as a whole it comes together in a really cool way. This is 100% the benchmark for WtC fanfic to beat going forward

  I'm the kind of person who despises ambiguity, so here's my attempt at puzzling it out. Regardless of whether the author even had a final answer in mind, there's still evidence that can be looked at. Spoilers hereon ofc.

  -- **A large amount of information about Aerb has been created, including knowledge of tech that doesn't exist on earth (according to Amaryllis).** That doesn't happen during psychosis: Joon is not an inventor and can't create that sort of thing ex nihilo.

  So Maddie's hypothesis could be confirmed as false if Amaryllis could whip up working blueprints or otherwise produce information beyond what a psychotic person is capable of. There are other limits to what the human mind could generate that he could push at, like getting Amaryllis to do math that he personally couldn't do or to draw on an immensity of Aerbian culture that no one person could come up with themselves.

  -- **The game layer is at exactly no point mentioned by anyone other than Joon.** Amaryllis's hypothesis already holds the least weight (really? Mome Rath never had anywhere near this kind of power), but if it were correct, there's no reason she shouldn't have had her own layer. This is a light shift away from the hell hypothesis, since the devils *would* have been able to drag knowledge of it out of him, but no one ever brought it up.

  -- **Bethel is out of character.** She's not that crass or profanity-laden in canon, she talks like a calm, collected empress. This is a shift towards the hell hypothesis, since Joon probably should have been able to come up with better dialogue if he were generating the delusions himself, rather than a devil trying to figure out Bethel secondhand. I'm assuming this is watsonian because I like to assume things are watsonian.

  -- **Ten years is a long time.** Given the amount of pull Amaryllis has, the pressure Valencia can exert in the hells, and the importance Joon has, there's a possibility they could yoink him out somehow, time travel, create a clone that the game layer hops to, etc. So docking a couple of points from the hell hypothesis.

  -- **The way Joon died in the hell hypothesis is void snipers.** The DM isn't pulling punches much, but he still controls what comes after the players. And frankly, this is an absurd threat to send against a DnD group. An unknown entity assassinates you for unknown reasons using an unblockable sniper rifle. You don't see them. Your players are just like "..okay?" They feel cheated, they don't feel like they had a chance to react or any agency. Would the DM let this happen anyways? Possibly. Still docking mild percentage points from the hell hypothesis.

  -- **The DM is running using Joon's style.** Related to the last point, Joon wouldn't rob his players of all agency, cause he's not a shit DM. This would just be a twist campaign where going to hell or being imprisoned is the adventure hook. Which is what lends the most positivity to this story tbh. It is incredibly likely that Joon has an out.

  -- **The game layer is sacrosanct.** The only way Joon could be prevented from seeing it is on *his* end, by rendering him unable to perceive or recognize it. A delusion entad shouldn't be sufficient to prevent Joon from seeing it, as it wouldn't be directly opposing the layer, but devils could probably figure out a trick and they'd also have the chance to learn about the layer over the course of years. This is the strongest evidence for the hell hypothesis over the prisoner one.

  -- **Dice Guy doesn't show.** Joon dying or going to hell is the sort of thing he'd show up for. I get the sense he's the type to want to get closure if Joon's story were truly over or to talk it over if it were taking on a new bent for ten years. However, devils could erase the memory of Dice Guy unless Dice Guy specially prevented that, so slight nudge towards hypothesis prisoner.

  -- **Joon is apparently able to use magic.** I think this would be hard for devils to simulate as I understand it, they'd have to be literally reading his mind and replicating the magic effects he thinks of, or using their own delusion magic. Bump towards imprisonment.

  So if I had to put money down it would be on the prisoner hypothesis. The game layer not existing is a strong push towards hell being true, but the rest of the evidence seems to push towards imprisonment.

    > Joon is apparently able to use magic

    The only indication he was able to use magic is Grak (he didn't have the proper sensory feedback to his magic, it was only Grak telling him to stop that indicated that he might have any).  Aerb's normal magics don't work in hell, so if it was hell, the demons could let him flail around trying to use magic and fake someone telling him to stop trying to use magic.  Detecting when he is trying to use magic (for instance, Grak's instruction to use vibration magic) might be hard, but it is a lot more tractable than fully faking his magic.

    There are a few options that aren't presented as hypotheses:

    * The game layer glitched out transporting Juniper to a glitchy simulation of his life on earth with glitchy emulations of his companions.  The companions each having a (incomplete) explanation is a result of the game layer or DM trying to pull together an explanation while the glitch is fixed/the system reset.  The problem will get fixed soon, Juniper just needs to not try anything that could disrupt the fix (hence Grak's and Valencia's explanations along with the peaceful final meeting with the Locus).

    * Juniper accidentally fulfilled the conditions to enter the Land of Dreams and is being tormented/trapped there.  We know the Dream realm is a thing from a brief guide to Aerb and I think it was Raven mentioned that Uther previously fought with the Lord of Dreams.  (edit found the [chapter](https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/38858003#workskin) its mentioned)

    * This is a normal dream/nightmare, but next to the locus.  The locus was trying to give Juniper a solid night's sleep but in the process prevented Juniper from waking up normally.  Locus shenanigans also stopped Juniper from accessing his magic in this dream.  This explains the final interaction being with the locus.

    * The DM forked Juniper and is screwing around with a copy.  For fun, or maybe to stress test it, or maybe to check Juniper mindset without his power, or maybe to prepare a return to home module for a future adventure.  

    * And for completely off-the-wall low probability explanation: Juniper is reality warper.  He accidentally banished himself to a world of his own creation (either faking Arthur's involvement, or retroactively drawing him in, or having sent him to a world of his own creation in the first place).  The game layer is a result of his reality warping powers bleeding through and trying to help him.  The DM/narrative is his subconscious pushing back.  His reality warping is acting up again, throwing him into a mixed up reality and shuffling around different possible explanations.

    It seems pretty much certain Joon is in a dream. According to WtC chapter 2, the game layer appears any time Joon closes his eyes for at least three seconds. However, based on the bad dreams he has after Fenn dies, like in Chapter 120, it's also clear that the game layer does not appear while Joon is dreaming. As such, the loss of the game layer and his magical senses should immediately make a dream/nightmare the most likely explanation.

    Even so, being trapped in a dream/nightmare state is not mutually exclusive with many of the other possible explanations. For example, as Amaryllis notes in chapter 144, Bethel has the Dagger of Dreamspeech, allowing her to enter the dreams of anyone sleeping inside of her domain. The dagger is also mentioned in Chapter 105, which has an added note that it makes it possible to 'kill' people in their dreams rendering them comatose, though it leaves unclear what would befall their soul/spirit. If Bethel has acquired an entad which allows her to make people sleep, like the pipe Yarrow used to put Joon to sleep, she could grab Joon while he's vulnerable and endlessly torture him in a permanent nightmare state.

    Similarly, the dream/nightmare state does not exclude being taken prisoner by an Anglecynn fireteam or being in Hell. There's presumably a multitude of ways to make people sleep and then induce or interfere with their dreams to psychologically attack them. There's also the Lord of Dreams mentioned in WtC chapter 148, which wasn't even addressed as a possibility in this sequence.

    Waking up is definitely going to be tricky. There's no evidence in the canon that Joon can use magic in his sleep, though it seems possible that he may be able to learn to do so. The reaction that he got from 'Grak' in this story would suggest that he has perhaps already started to learn to use magic in his sleep, so it may just be a matter of learning to have a 'lucid dream' of sorts, where he's able to access the game layer and use magic even when he can't wake up.

    Another piece of evidence for prisoner hypothesis is that grak was the only one to use a keyring phrase.

  I see what you did there.

    I don't.  What reference am I missing?

      It is a reference to >!The Good Place!<.  Be warned, though, that the information given is a spoiler for the first season.  Unfortunately, since the details making it a spoiler are already listed, there is no way to tell you which show it is without also giving plot details.  Therefore, up to you whether or not to read the spoiler text.

- u/Calsem:
  ```
  This fanfic is too good. I suspect it's actually the WTC author operating under a psuedonym again lol
  ```

- u/Makin-:
  ```
  This is great. I wrote something longer in the Discord I won't bother repeating here, but I recommend the fic to anyone reading this message. 

  Also, the girl reading this, write more WTC fanfic, let's keep this streak going.
  ```

- u/Green0Photon:
  ```
  Honestly, I'd really like a fic that just takes the premise of the first chapter, and runs with it, instead of the rest of the hypotheses. What a cool fic premise. Perhaps with some low key magic existing top in modern earth, street magic style.

  I'd also love to see that premise used to insert them into a crossover fanfic setting. Harry Potter would be cool. Nasuverse/Fate might be even cooler.
  ```

  - u/honoredb:
    ```
    Yes! One reason I wanted to write this was to kickstart other people writing WTC fanfiction (which turned out to be delightfully unnecessary by the time I posted it), so it's kind of an anthology of potential premises.
    ```

  ```
  This is one of the most cursed things I have ever read.
