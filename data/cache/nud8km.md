## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  Fanfiction.net is circling the drain - [password recovery doesn't work](https://universalfanfic.tumblr.com/post/652584313450332160) and in other ways it seems to have passed beyond maintenance mode into 'no one trying to fix anything' mode. (IIRC moderation has basically stopped.)

  Therefore, recommend the best FF.net works that you haven't seen copied to Ao3 or other sites.

    Honestly, if AO3 takes the torch, in many ways it’d be better. But we still risk losing a lot of stuff this way.

    I don’t know many of them, but my two immediate recommendations are [Chanson de Geste](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5615090/1/) and [Autumn’s Frontier](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11015476/1/Event-Horizon-Book-1-Autumn-s-Frontier). Also TVTropes seems to have decently curated fan fiction recommendation pages which could be a good starting point.

    EDIT: oh, damn, just realised, there's no AO3 mirror for [Chilli and the Chocolate Factory](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13451176/1/Chili-and-the-Chocolate-Factory-Fudge-Revelation). Definitely needs scrubbing (well, I already have a MOBI of it in my Kindle, if it helps).
    ```

    - u/Auroch-:
      ```
      AO3 is better in a large variety of ways, I agree. If there was broad up-to-date mirroring to AO3, I would be washing my hands of FF.net and [waving it goodbye](https://i.imgur.com/gC5URHh.gif). My only concern is data loss.

  I'm down to scraping the bottom of the barrel again. I'm looking for an isekai progression fantasy to read, and there are *just so many of them*, but a *vast, vast majority* are just so... bad. Like awfully, irrationally bad. 

  So yeah, probably been asked a ton before but, any good ones to recommend? Hoping for something on WTC's level is probably unrealistic, but maybe someone can suggest something that just might come close.

  I've read Delve and found it barely okay. Dungeon Crawler Carl was/is pretty decent. Then I've read others like A Hero's War, Wandering Inn, 2YE, and they're all just rather lackluster (no offense to the authors).

  Edit: thanks everyone for all the recs. Will look through them

    I've got a bunch of mediocre-at-best recommendations to dump here that have piled up over the years, generally in the "go back to it eventually" pile in my bookmarks. My memory is fuzzy though. 

    (Editing in as I go through my bookmarks, since I don't trust this comment to get saved right on mobile if I try to hold it and tab back and forth until finished.) 

    [The man picked up by the gods: ](https://jigglypuffsdiary.com/the-man-picked-up-by-the-gods-reboot/)I read it, got through a bunch of the reboot after I waited for that to pile up, then put it to the side. Not bad, but too small ball or slice of life to really grab me. Translation was fine, maybe above average by virtue of how much crap is out there.

    [Death Mage: ](https://lightnovelbastion.com/novel/death-mage/) Does some genuinely interesting stuff with powers and abilities, but is weighed down by basically everything else. No events have any weight to them, side characters characters feel like a checklist, plot is dumb, writing/translation is bloated, other perspectives and b plots take too long to impact stuff, becomes increasingly "numbers go up" with progression as the levels of power rise. I basically only read it because sunk cost fallacy and reasonably paced updates. Its a time sink and time waster with a huge amount of available content to read. 

    [Ouroboros Record: ](https://www.yamitranslations.com/?m=1) Interesting ideas and abilities, main character's motivation is actually noteworthy, but not much else is. Translation like something thrown into Google translate and patched up, random and infrequent new translated chapters posted. Grimdark as fuck, the main character's methods wouldn't be out of place among WW2 Nazi scientists given the horrible experiments he does, and would be difficult to read if done by with actually decent prose or descriptions (is it just me, or do so many Japanese authors just not bother with actual descriptions? I tried reading the actually published LN of  Konosuba ages back and it felt like someone wrote a timeline of events and filled in banter in the gaps). Oh, and after the intro arc there's a short timeskip arc with a detective investigating the main character's past to fill the gap, and its a disproportionately weak arc, just warning you now. 

    [Paladin of the End (/The Faraway Paladin): ](https://www.novelupdates.com/series/paladin-of-the-end/) Arguably the best book here, but probably the least rational (among an already struggling group). It does a decent to good job at worldbuilding, writing and translation, unique side characters, giving events weight and meaning, etc. It actually works in a religious main character in an isekai in a functional and interesting way, which is praiseworthy by itself. The problem is that the protagonist spends every book just falling ass-backwards into wherever the plot and other characters take him. He exhibits barely any agency, has no concrete goals beyond the immediate short term, and doesn't have any unique desires beyond the blandest shounen protagonist if you ignore the broad "be a good priest for my forgotton/unloved God" thing, which is halfway sorted out by just being reasonably kind to other people. (I forget where I got the pdfs from, I think it was vn-meido. Also there's a [manga adaptation](https://mangakakalot.com/read-ob6rm158504851838), which is vaguely passable if bland without the pacing and inner monologue that helps the novels do things better)

    [Dungeon Defense:](https://shalvationtranslations.wordpress.com/dungeon-defense-toc/) holds up to the average Light Novel well, probably fails any quality test from this subreddit's readers. Kind of feels like a discount edgelord version of Lelouch vi Britannia as the protagonist. It was overall a reasonable novel with some surprisingly above average writing, until it came out the author was plagarising a bunch from translated and tweaked speeches and writings from famous philosophers, and the translation out of English and then back into it obscured this for long enough for 5 novels to come out for the publisher quietly stopped doing anything with the author. There was also some overtly kinky stuff that was barely offscreen if I remember right. I read this very long ago now though, so the novel as a whole could easily be bad and I just misremembered it.
    ______

    Anyway that's everything, I don't exactly *recommend* anything on this list though. There's other isekai stuff from previous recommendation threads I've commented on in the past though. Youjo Senki is good and talked about by others in this thread, and I've wrote some page-long comments on Overlord in previous recommendation threads, which I'd give a tentative recommendation to, with a big "Your Mileage May Vary" stamped on it. The Youjo Senki anime is good as an introduction, although the depth of the Light Novels is much better. I honestly don't know if I'd recommend the Overlord anime at all, but definitely no recommendation for watching past the first season to get a vague idea of things.

  - u/PastafarianGames:

    Beneath the DragonEye Moons is a pretty standard recommendation.

    Azarinth Healer is garbage, badly written and with nonexistent characterization. But if all you want out of an isekai progression fantasy is action, numbers going up, and a complete lack of pathos or whinging on the protagonist's part, it's *vast*. If you don't mind more grimness and pathos, Abyssal Road Trip at least has characters and a world that isn't nonsensically boring and boringly nonsensical, but it's also got serious technical writing problems.

    Have you read the OG, A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court? It's free! (Because it's public domain.)

    Some pulpy writers write pretty good isekai pulp. Eric Flint's Ring of Fire series, for example. I mean, it's trashy pulpy but hey it's fun.

    Unbound Soul is pretty fun! I like its lack of pathos. There's a prequel that's a dungeon core story that sets up some of the worldbuilding.

    Ar'Kendrithyst isn't really progression fantasy, but it sort of opens with "what if Delve, but more interesting" in a lot of ways. It's long. The beginning is considered rocky. Buyer beware.

    Technically, Vainquer the Dragon is isekai progression fantasy, and it's one of the classics at this point.

    Cinnamon Bun is probably the fluffiest and most adorable isekai progression fantasy out there. Warning: contains hugs.

    Does it have to be free? Prose-wise it's not always the best, but I've had a blast reading through the 11 volumes currently available of "So I'm a Spider, so what?!". It's isekai, it's got a creative spin (a whole class gets blown up and transferred to another world, spread among different factions, some of which enemies to each other), it's got some interesting twists and subversions, more to the world that meets the eye, and an immensely fun protagonist. Too bad it's not complete yet, but it feels like it's at least moving towards an ending. Next volume comes out in July. There's also a free Web Novel, but honestly, the translation on that seemed outright terrible to me.

    *Youjo Senki* (a light novel/manga) and the fanfic [*A Young Woman's Political Record*](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13002064/1/A-Young-Woman-s-Political-Record/)are both isekai progression fantasy, though about different things. The former is about the MC's future knowledge being used in war (so making use of new tactics/weapons in battle) while the latter is about political/social/economic/military gain.

    It's well done IMO, but the way the MC is written is kinda backwards compared to most stories. Rather than wanting to move up in the world, the MC just wants a quiet job so they can live a stress-free life. The catch is that the MC, who is a reincarnated 21st century Japanese salaryman, is constantly applying their own logic to the early 20th century...and keeps screwing over their own retirement plan. Their life is basically "task failed successfully."

    ---

    [*Tales of the Reincarnated Lord*](https://www.novelupdates.com/series/tales-of-the-reincarnated-lord/) is a story about a guy who transmigrates into a medieval world. He's the son of a minor lord who inherits some land after his dad passes away.

    There's more focus on social/technological advancement. The MC was a Chinese guy who is a couple centuries ahead of everyone else, but he's hardly perfect and can't just tell people how to make firearms or whatever, but can find smart people and tell them what to research. The progression part of the story has more to do with him rising through the ranks of the nobility as he grows his lands, though there are parts of the story that focus on his fighting abilities.

    The author is Chinse, but is seems that he took cues from western literature, so there's not as much emphasis on face-slapping, ridiculous distances, exponential levelling, or any of those things usually associated with  CN webnovels.

    The story, while good, is incomplete - the author had some censorship issue with the government that coincided with his getting sick, so he dropped the story. He still complete ~600 chapters, and the last chapter wraps up the MC's arc quite nicely.

      Ehhh, the entire dream world is nothing but a huge downside to me. It's a complete deus ex machina to help him progress past what he could reasonable accomplish from memory alone, except it's even worse than a normal deus ex machina because it's a huge drawn-out thing that completely takes away from the story. It's difficult for me to even give context for how terrible and baffling its inclusion is, because you simply don't see such things in novels typically; it'd be like if Worm had the entirety of Twilight just kind of shoved between regular chapters, with basically zero attempt to make it a reasonable inclusion. It's such a disappointing downside, that it feels necessary to me to mention it when recommending the novel, because as far as I'm concerned you can just drop the story once it appears and you really don't lose much at all. 

      It does start incredibly well though, and maintains that for quite some time.

    Most of these aren't rational or rationalistic.

    * Ar'Kendrythist: The system is deep and broad, the lore is also deep and interesting. I like the characters and especially the slow slice of life pace. The magic is fantastic.

    * Infinite Realms: Monsters and Legends, The characters are interesting and usually have depth. The magic system is a nice combination of three different systems, all distinct. Also nice consideration of how such a magic system would change society. I'd consider it close to rational. 

    * The Snake Report: I really enjoyed the humor at first and I found the slow change into a serious story compelling. On hiatus but ends at a nice point with only a few chapters thereafter. 

    * A Bad Name, Greg Veder vs the World, The Games we Play. Three gamer fanfics with powers akin to Jihan from The Gamer. Only The Games we Play is finished.

      > A Bad Name

      This one is on hiatus last I recall and the thread locked. I think the author is focusing on his other story [Marked](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/marked-eberron-worm.844115/), which is a Worm/Eberron story.

  I'd like to recommend [Valkyrie's Shadow](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/39336/valkyries-shadow) here, though it's an Overlord fanfic that requires reading the original, so I'm not entirely sure how many people will be able to read it. Regardless, I think many people here would enjoy it. It's primarily focused around kingdom-building, and in a way that is much more in-depth than the original Overlord. It primarily follows Ludmila Zahradnik, a Frontier Noble who unexpectedly became a Baroness when her entire family was killed in combat against her new liege. Ludmila is very adaptable and canny, however, so she quickly adapts to the new realities of living under the Sorcerous Kingdom. 

  I'm terrible at writing these sorts of things, check out the description on RR, it's better than what I wrote. I've been enjoying it a ton and I thought the people here would as well. The author writes at a breakneck pace (the story came out 4 months ago and it's already up to 622k words, averaging around 5k words per day), yet the spelling and grammar are generally flawless.

      I mean, how much of Overlord isn't focusing on the main cast? There are books almost entirely from a non-main cast character, like the Lizardmen arc and the two books with Neia, and there's still significant departures like how Jircniv gets a bunch of screentime, there's the Tomb Invaders book, and Sebas is front and centre for two books and then basically in the background for the rest of the story. I mean Overlord is weird, like there's the time a giant flaming demon gets summoned against an army in one of the later books with Neia in it and the perspective shifts to like 4 different points of view of random soldiers getting burned to death as the demon casually walks through the army. Overlord is very weird.
      ```

    - u/ahasuerus_isfdb:
      ```
      > I'm not sure how a derivative work not focusing on the main cast would play out

      I am 70K in and the main cast is very much present and important to the story. We even get their POV scenes. Other pluses:

      * The MC is fairly rational. She is not an emotionless robot, but she manages to get her emotions under control much faster and more efficiently than almost everyone around her, especially people her age. She tries to use logic to figure out the rules governing her new reality, although it's difficult to do because the new rules are so different from what she is accustomed to.
      * The main cast from the Overlord canon is reasonably well done, believable and not sugar-coated.
      * The author knows enough medieval history to make the society look believable.
      * Adult human leaders have agency and act logically based on their personalities, background and the information that they have. It doesn't always end well for them because they are dealing with a situation which they have no context for -- or they misunderstand the context.

      OTOH, I had two issues with the fic, especially early on:

      * The writing could use more polish. It became easier to ignore as things kicked into gear.
      * When the author promised "slow buildup", s/he meant it.

        It's been a community for 6 years, so right around the time of the new movies.

        Most of the content I've seen from them recently is focused on the Clone Wars or on the original trilogy, but I suppose I'm more likely to pay attention to the scale/logistics posts.

        The newer films shoot a lot of holes in that kind of discussion but my understanding is that the expanded material is decent. There's a lot of chatter about the Mandalorian, as it's both popular and strongly aesthetic. Something called the High Republic gets attention too. I believe it's adding detail to the Republic a shorter time before Episode I, so it's basically worldbuilding cocaine.

        I spend a lot of time fishing for evidence of my pet theory that SW planets are smaller in scale than our own.

    * Author Summary: *The story of an unyielding man thrust into a galaxy of myriad grays, of questioning the past, and of walking the same steps, wondering whether any answers beyond death lie at the end of that long, ever-winding road*
    * Personal Notes: Shirou ends up in the Mass Effect universe and goes through Space Boot Camp™ with a young Shepherd. A great look into how our favorite Magus would fare in a world of biotics and futuristic tech. A **V**ery **L**ong **R**ead with surprisingly consistent quality.

    [Fate Far Side](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7154469/1/Fate-Far-Side) \[**111k words**\] (**Complete**) {**Fate x Tsukihime**}

    * Author Summary: *While Shiki is away, Shirou comes to play at the Tohno estate. A combination of FSN and each Far Side route of Tsukihime.*
    * Personal Notes: A shockingly believable work. If you want to know how Shirou would fare in Shiki's place look no further. Great writing, great characterization, three routes in one fic. What's not to love?

    [Postnuptial Disagreements](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8078340/1/Postnuptial-Disagreements) \[**87k words**\] (**Complete**) {**Fate** x **Sekirei**}

    * Author Summary: *Years after his parents survived Heaven's Feel, the son of Kayneth and Sola-Ui finds himself in a different sort of supernatural tournament. But can he survive superpowered alien females, scheming businessmen, and his own partner's urge to strangle him?*
    * Personal Notes: Despite being a Sekirei crossover there are no harem antics. Come for the battle royale culture clash, stay for the fun character dynamics.

    [Maybe I'm a Lion](https://forums.nrvnqsr.com/showthread.php/1870-Maybe-I-m-a-Lion-%28KnK-Prototype-Crossover%29) \[**430k words**\] (**Abandoned**) {**Kara no Kyokai** x **Protoype**}

    * My Summary: *What happens when grimdark magic meets a superpowered bioweapon?*
    * Personal Notes: One of my top 3 fanfiction of all time. A long, contemplative crossover with excellent integration and exquisitely choreographed fights.

    [fate first order derivative](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12814598/1/fate-first-order-derivative) \[**107k words**\] (**Abandoned**) {**Fate/Stay Night**}

    * Author Summary: *Eccentric nerd Tom Tomonaga lives down the street from Shirou Emiya. He's had a... \*challenging\* few days. Time loops, science, magic, and - oh, yeah - the end of the universe.*
    * Personal Notes: Fun time loop story. It's been a while since I read this but I remember the OC being a-ok.

    [The Sage's Disciple](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-sages-disciple-fate-zero-si.542965/) \[**54k words**\] (**Complete**) {**Fate/Zero**}

    * My Summary: *SI wakes up right at the start of the fourth holy grail war, right in the middle of a summoning*
    * Personal Notes: Another one I haven't read in a while. From memory, it's mad scramble of abusing meta-knowledge to fake competence and survive.

      Sometimes, the oddest crossovers birth the best of stories. It still baffles me each time though. Thank you for recommending Postnuptial Disagreements.

    Seconding the recs for Postnuptial Disagreements and Maybe I'm a Lion, though I will note that MIaL is dead as far as I could tell. Both are *really solid.*

    I'd also recommend [Fate/Hollow Fake](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/fate-hollow-fake.12936/), a complete story drawing a lot of elements from FSN and Zero. Don't be put off by the quest format--it works really well with the source material. In general this one is good at matching some of the Fate aesthetics, especially the Servant identities and Magecraft. Note when you get to the end: There is a sequel and it's Very Important if you're upset about the ending.

    I'll throw in [Servant of Zero](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10225110/1/Servant-of-Zero), a Fate/Familiar of Zero crossover that was pretty fun while it lasted. MC is Archer, so he's a bit of an outside context problem for the happy-go-lucky light novel world of Familiar.

  I've got a rogue memory bouncing around my head, but I can't seem to figure out which story it came from.  I'm pretty sure I didn't come up with it myself, at any rate... Maybe someone will recognize it?

  Anyway: In the setting, in living memory, the entire population of a city (or a small country?) was compelled to complete a mysterious construction over the course of a month or so. The construction may have been a tower or something. Nobody knew *why* they built what they did, or even *what* it did, merely that whatever it was they were working on that month was important. I think they maybe couldn't even remember the month in question, after it was all over? I think it had something to do with time as a concept, or an unseen cosmic threat or something, but my memory is really hazy.

  Whatever it was, I think I read it a long time ago, and it was probably a novel. It's definitely not from the ending of >!Worm!<.

  If anyone recognizes anything from that vague description, I'd appreciate it.  The idea is interesting enough that it implies that the story it's attached to would maybe be worth a re-read, *if only I could remember what it freaking was.*

    To me that's vaguely reminiscent of a couple of different horror stories. 

    * *[The Tommyknockers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tommyknockers)*, a novel by Stephen King - In the latter part of the book the brainwashed villagers >!labor to unearth an alien spacecraft!<.
    * *[Uzumaki](https://myanimelist.net/manga/436/Uzumaki)*, a manga by Junji Ito - Starting in volume 3 the brainwashed villagers >!begin constructing a spiraling pattern of conjoined row houses!<.

    you also get a discount on the audiobook for owning the ebook. (7 dollars, instead the normal 10).

  Honestly this might sound niche, but I'm looking for a rational take on the battle-royale/hunger-games type of story? Basically where a bunch of different characters are pitted against each-other in a death game. Thanks!
  ```

  - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
    ```
    If you’re okay with Visual Novels, look into the Zero Escape series. Pretty good twist on that genre (a bit more Saw-like in how the people are mainly pit against puzzles, though they could sometimes gain an edge by killing each other).
    ```

    - u/justallard:
      ```
      Zero Escape is absolutely fantastic. If you can, play the first game (9 Hours, 9 Persons, 9 Doors) on the DS--the port to PC is subpar for various reasons.
      ```

  - u/andor3333:
    ```
    [Tower of God](https://towerofgodkaminotou.com/) Manga has some really clever strategies in the early chapters by a character named Koon. Fair warning, I read a long way in and it was good but I eventually stopped when the translation I read got removed, so I can only recommend the first part. This link looks like a new translation or a mirror with popup ads.

    [Postnuptial disagreements](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8078340/1/Postnuptial-Disagreements), a crossover with Fate characters added to Sekirei's *batshit insane* death game romance. It's the kind of premise that begins from crackfic territory, but I found it had clever plotting, well-designed fights, and compelling characters. I had no familiarity with Sekirei or with the specific Fate elements involved and still thought it was great.

    I've read other Fate fanfiction which arguably qualifies, but only [Fate/hollow fake](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/fate-hollow-fake.12936/) approaches that quality level. I don't think it quite fits your request due to >!spending more time as a sort of Team Deathmatch than a Battle Royale!<. 

    If that wasn't enough anime for you, [Fairy Dance of Death](https://archiveofourown.org/works/2393225/chapters/5288507) (unfinished; probably still updating?) is a more reasonable reimagining of Sword Art Online. So it's not strictly a battle royale, but it is still a permadeath arena with hundreds or thousands of involuntary combatants. Fairly rational and full of "damn, that *would* be a cool feature in a game" ideas.

    ```
    I thought /u/Benedict_SC had a rational!Danganropa fic, but it doesn't seem to be on [his Ao3](https://archiveofourown.org/users/Benedict_SC/pseuds/Benedict_SC/works), so I'm not sure where it does live. (You may know him as the author of [Cordyceps](https://archiveofourown.org/works/6178036/chapters/14154868).)
    ```

    - u/Radioterrill:
      ```
      You might be thinking of [Danganronpa: Operation VK](https://archiveofourown.org/works/11965917/chapters/27058647)? It's by another author but he did the art for it.
      ```

      - u/Benedict_SC:
        ```
        Yeah, that's the one. Not *quite* rationalfic but a pretty well-constructed set of fair-play mysteries with good characters. If you can get past the kind of awkward VN-influenced writing style (and I have to imagine most readers here are well-trained in getting past awkward writing styles), it's pretty rewarding. I did write a fic-of-a-fic called The Bleeding Heart of the Oborozuka Vampire based on it, but that is a fic with an audience of like five people, as it's a crossover between VK and Umineko's truth duel system and I have no idea if anyone else would get anything out of it.

        (I did have my own Danganronpa by the name of Bullet Proof *way* back when on the now-defunct MSPA forums, which I've been working on rebooting on and off, but don't hold your breath on that.)
        ```

    - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
      ```
      Honestly I would also recommend Danganronpa itself, not properly rational but still a lot of fun.
      ```
