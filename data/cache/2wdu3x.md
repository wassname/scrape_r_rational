## Donna from Parks and Rec is into cryonics

### Post:

Just watched the most recent episode. Ron says something about dying being natural. Donna says "Speak for yourself, before I die I'm gonna freeze my head like Ted Williams, wait a thousand years thaw that out, slap it on a robot, keep on ballin"

### Comments:

- u/Transfuturist:
  ```
  Also Chris Traeger on longevity: "Scientists believe that the first human being who will live 150 years has already been born. I believe I am that human being."
  ```
