  > There are rumors that they're planning something big in the Dead Ward. If they manage to kidnap or kill the Necromancers there, hundreds of undead will become free to spread death and destruction throughout the city!

  Wait, is the implication that factories are being run with zombie or skeleton workers for automation? Because that seems a great Discworld-like scenario for social commentary...

    ```
    Using undead as a benign source of cheap labor is a semi-common inversion of the 'evil necromancer summoning armies of undead trope'.

    Edit: Or at least I thought it was, but I can only come up with Warbreaker and the Death Gate cycle as examples and a quick trip to tvtropes didn't help either, so maybe it's not that common (though it should be).
