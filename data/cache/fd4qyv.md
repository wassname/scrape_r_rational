## In most movies/TV aliens are just humans in makeup. What stories have explored truly alien minds/cultures in an interesting way?

### Post:

And can you share some awesome examples from these stories, the details/ideas that you've liked?

  [Stanislav Lem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem) was *the* great master of non-anthropomorphic aliens:

  Solaris (his most famous work)

  Eden (I like it even more then Solaris, though aliens are not so incomprehensible)

  Not about aliens per se but their trace: His Master Voice

  From more modern SF: [Embassytown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embassytown) by China Mieville

    Embassytown taught me what literature is. There is a meaning in Embassytown; I cannot convey that meaning without telling the entire story of Embassytown.

  I've recommended Blindsight on this forum a few times; (mild spoilers) it's a first contact story about aliens observing Earth from a base in the Oort Cloud. They discover fast-moving 9-legged aliens they name "Scramblers" but struggle to make any sense of how to communicate with them due to their extremely alien minds. I'd recommend actually reading it for why these aliens are so interesting. 

   (Heavy spoilers, entire ending and thematic conclusion of the book) >!The aliens are extremely intelligent, moreso than humans, but they do not have any interior experience of consciousness. Consciousness turns out to be unnecessary for intelligence, and a waste of calories and computing power.!<

    I was going to say Blindsight as well. The other idea with that story is that, when dealing with Aliens, you send a bunch of neuro-atypicals in the hopes that one of them will see what the aliens mean. So they send a cyborg, an AI, a schizophrenic linguist, a semiotician who had a radical brain surgery and a vampire. (The last part is — surprisingly— not groan inducing at all).   

    Also Blindsight is available for free online.

    Ditto - This is what I came to say too ;)  It does the best job of pointing out just how alien aliens could be.

    Not as big of a Orson Card fan as I used to be, but the later books in the Enders Game series also kind of gets into this.

    Uplift books by David Brin kind of go there.

    I'm not remembering titles but there was a lot of good stuff in the late 70s, early 80s with the theme of "Human dropped in alien culture" and trying to adapt / go native, kind of as pushback to colonialism/cultural imperialism.

     The Sparrow (The Sparrow, #1) by Mary Doria Russell - is another reflection on this - Flippantly called "Jesuits in space", it is inspired by experiences of early Jesuits missionaries in the "New World" - but it is not especially religious, and kind of casts the efforts as Hubris.  But the Aliens are Alien, and the author is ruthless... not a warm and fuzzy book...

      Second this. Been years since I read any of his novels, but I distinctly remember a few weird as hell species, foremost amongst those being a race of doughnut-pyramid people that store their memories in wax.

  "Three Worlds Collide" by Eliezer Yudkowsky
  ```

- u/PeridexisErrant:
  ```
  Vernor Vinge's *A Fire Upon the Deep*.

   Several examples, most of them spoilers, and it's a fantastic read that doesn't deserve spoiling so I'll leave it there.

  ```
  The Tines from Venor Vinge's A Fire Upon the Deep.

  Physically, the Tines look basically just like wolves, but their sapience is an emergent property of the pack as a whole which has a massive impact on their culture and their concept of personhood in general.

  For instance, a particular Tine is technically immortal since they can add new members to the pack as old ones age and die, but the primary memories and skills are tied to the biological brains of each member, so each person will inevitably change as time goes on as memories are copied and fade. Memories become secondary as they get copied into new members' brains, and then tertiary when they get copied again, and eventually things that happened long ago become as if it belonged to someone else.

  The Tines also have an interesting way of relating to their bodies. Since each "person" is the entire pack, the Tines don't consider a single member as a person or even as the same species as themselves, really, but more like a pet that they have to take care of. Biological urges like breeding is done clinically and with detachment, and the Tines raise new pups like a dog breeder would. A Tine could go to a professional breeder to pick up a new pup to add to themselves, the pack, when necessary.

  Rather than biologically, intimacy is done by intermixing packs, by literally fusing two Tines into one temporarily. New Tines are created when a large pack fissions, or when sub-sapient members spontaneous come together to form a pack and thus a new Tine. The most intimate act two Tines can do is to trade members with each other.
  ```

  - u/MultipartiteMind:
    ```
    (Somehow I had missed or forgotten the fissioning part, and thought the child-Tines were genetically originated.  O.O  This lends new overtones to the concept 'all three of my children turned evil', though I might also be misremembering that part.)
    ```

- u/IICVX:
  ```
  The Crystal Society is (imo) a good exploration of the internal life of a paperclip maximizer. It does have some literal alien psychology in the second book, but that's a bit more incoherent.
  ```

  - u/MultipartiteMind:
    ```
    (I also enjoyed the internal matters, but found most of the main plot much less interesting.)  


    >!"The aliens who came down from the spaceship to make an 'Embassy' just planted a lot of the same type of plant and then got in a hole and died.  The messages from the spaceship showed the aliens still there weren't bothered, but when the plants were even slightly injured the messages from the spaceship were FURIOUS.  As an AI, I have deduced what not even one of seven billion human brains could even guess at--/THE PLANTS ARE THE MAIN ALIENS/.  Be in awe of my inhuman level of insight."!<
    ```

  The Mote In God's Eye is a pretty good one. The aliens are more strongly adapted to their niche than humans, and have several sub-species with different cognitive specializations. In terms if key ideas, it's more xenoecology fiction than xenobiology fiction. But yeah, basically all the good stuff is spoilers and it's a short book.
  ```

  - u/IvorTheEngine:
    ```
    The Puppeteers and Kzinti from his Ring World books are good too. They both have a very different outlook on life to humans.
    ```

- u/BoxSparrow:
  ```
  Diaspora (Greg Egan) has a relatively interesting look at them in that they can only be communicated with through a series of mental modifications that brings the communicator closer and closer to the alien's mindset. However, it's a relatively small part of the book, though the rest of it is still interesting.

  The guy who made Transdimensional Brain Chip also drew another (complete) [comic](http://spacespy.thecomicseries.com/) about a guy who has to interact with a bunch of weird alien cultures. As with Transdimensional Brain Chip, the art is dire and the dialogue is stilted, and the alien culture stuff is all done through kind of a reductive evopsych lens, but it's still a solid read for anyone looking for Weird Alien Shit. There are dozens of bizarre, creative alien designs and the plot is regularly paused while the narration goes into depth about why a particular alien does a particular thing, the evolutionary history of where that behavior came from, the implications of that behavior for their wider culture, how the behavior and its root causes compare and contrast with related behaviors of humans and other alien species...It's silly, but a lot of fun. 

  Favorite details/ideas from it...One was this part where the human is trying to help an alien write a screenplay. He suggests that she cut the extended sequences about the hero trying to figure out which vegetables are safe to eat, and replace them with a romance arc. It turns out that vegetable discernment arcs are near-obligatory in this planet's fiction, and the alien is just as confused by the romance arc suggestion as the human is by the veggie stuff. The other is a bit about alien countercultures that I'm not going to describe at all because I don't want to spoil a great punchline, but you'll know it when you see it.

  Schlock Mercenary has dug into some of the differences a little bit, largely due to the absolute total freedom of the visual aspect - it's drawn (it's a webcomic), so the aliens can look like ANYTHING.  A scant few are even remotely humanoid, most look completely dissimilar to us.

  The Doctor Who episode Midnight.

  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midnight_(Doctor_Who)

  Also, this is not a movie or TV show, but the Ender’s Game sequel Speaker for the Dead.

  *Story of Your Life* by Ted Chiang is a classic
  ```

- u/UPBOAT_FORTRESS_2:
  ```
  *Accelerando* by Charles Stross might have a bit of what you're looking for, principally in the form of weird "future human" cultures, especially as practiced by uploaded consciousness running faster than meatspace brains

  There are also little touches with genuine aliens

  Robert J Sawyer is a scifi author who has several books with aliens in them, usually in the hard scifi genre.

  One of my favorite books by him is *Starplex*, in which humanity discovers a portal at the edge of the solar system and goes on to find other space-faring species. One of these is described as 'a watermelon in a wheelchair', another as a 'pig centaur', and another as a hairless creature that is actually water bound, so part of the multi-species ship is underwater. I love that his aliens are not human-based, or even remotely earth-based.

  The Swarm by Frank Schätzing doesn‘t feature proper space aliens but a still very alien intelligent  species from the deep sea

  Many books by Hal Clement and Robert Forward apply, and the science in these books is also very well researched:   
  Dragon's Egg- A civilization where practically 2d individuals the size of sesame seeds living a million times faster than us inhabit the surface of a neutron star, and make very gradual contact with a human spacecraft.  
  Mission of Gravity- A terrestrial planet as massive of Jupiter but spinning extremely fast, so that gravity at the equator is just a bit higher than Earth's, but the poles have hundreds of times as much as Earth. The inhabitants are millipedes with a culture built around the high and variable gravity.  
  Cycle of Fire- An detailed exploration of multiple alien civilizations on a planet around a binary star where seasons shift rapidly.

  I like Onwards to Providence(amateur fiction on Sufficient Velocity), it downplays how alien the aliens are at first, and how alien the human analogs are but as it progresses and worldbuilding happens you get a better picture. A minor thing that works well for example is how the first character introduced looks sorta humanoid at first but it's shown later that that's more a mimic octopus like thing from a species of diplomats, how Pylo works mentally is explored later than that.

  ```
  Speaker for the Dead - Orson Scott Card - main character has some kind of psychic connection with an alien queen
  ```

- u/jacdeal:
  ```
  Children of Time - main characters are intelligent creatures evolved from spider - the book details their thought processes and povs
  ```

  Honestly, I'm going to say that C.S. Lewis' *Out of the Silent Planet* is a really good look at alien psychology, even if it is entwined with religion. It takes the idea of aliens that don't have original sin and considers how humans would look in comparison, and also explores the concept of how the aliens don't have pets because they have other sapient species to fill that void. One of my favorite bits is near the end where one of the antagonist humans is trying to explain his moral perspective on why conquest is their right and the way the protagonist translates it the best he can with the aliens' concepts and makes it seem completely ridiculous.

    Hi. You just mentioned *Out Of The Silent Planet* by CS Lewis.

    I've found an audiobook of that novel on YouTube. You can listen to it here:

  Orion's Arm setting wiki. Various future offshoots of humanity are already weird enough, but the few discovered alien species are even more unusual. 

  My favorite one is [Whisper](https://www.orionsarm.com/eg-article/470007b39d192) - a whole planet's ecosystem transformed into an acoustic computer simulating a virtual world inhabited by the uploaded aliens.

    Disagreed, his Dirdir, Chasch, Wankh and Pnume are very much ‘dudes in costumes’, much like the aliens in his other cycles are, even sometimes indistinguishable from humans.

      This... is not... the conventional view... among science fiction fans...

  Movies/TV are not where you're going to find SF that really explores aliens, or anything else. There just isn't room.

  C. J. Cherryh has produced a bunch of great aliens, particularly in the Alliance/Union series and the Foreigner series. Try _Voyager in Night_, _The Faded Sun_, _Pride of Chanur_, and _Foreigner_.

  Bit more of a 'mainstream' example, but Liu Cixin's The Three Body Problem comes to mind. Would also second Blindsight.

  You call out movies/TV aliens, and there are absolutely some weirder ones out there, but just by virtue of the medium/actors they need to be humanoid. Most books/plenty of stories *do* actually do something interesting with their take on aliens.

  Here's a short that always comes to mind on this topic, appropriately named [Alien Minds](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/5m4jdf/alien_minds/?utm_source=amp&utm_medium=&utm_content=post_body)

- u/ArcFurnace:

  Only a short story, and only really alien in one specific way, but I really enjoyed [Alien Minds](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/5m4jdf/alien_minds/) from /r/HFY.
