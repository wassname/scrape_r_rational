  Yay, shitty fanfiction!
  Somehow the dragon lady's POV is less interesting than the dude's. Maybe it's because you're a dude?

    Hmm. I think I feel you, and I want to dive into that a bit but first I want to reinforce massively how much I'm loving this work. Srsly FormerlySarsaparilla, I'm really looking forward to every new chapter :)

    I feel like ashinator's right, tho. There's something... missing, from the Hailey chapters. There's something to Sean's chapters that just brings them *alive*. A depth to his narrative voice that none of the other characters quite have - although, I'd include, well, everyone else in that, not just Haley.

    I feel like... Hmm. I feel like the author is just invested in Sean's story more than anyone else's - Sean's story is proactive in a way that I don't think the other character's stories are. Everyone else is beholden either to circumstance or character, but I feel like Sean gets choices. Not always - the chase, for example, or the overall arc of "getting back to Haley", but enough.

    I want to harken to "Plus-Minus-Interesting" analysis. Haley's recent bought with the ring is a good example: this was a false choice for the character; there's no way she could have chosen any differently and remained true to herself. When the pluses and minuses were weighed, the choice was obvious.

    Contrast with Sean's apparent lack of choice in fanfiction: there's many other magical school stories to choose from, why that one? The pluses and minuses don't add up to an obvious conclusion (at least, not from here), and that makes it interesting, I'm thinking?

    I think... as someone definitely not in the arena, so definitely feel free to ignore the shit out me, just keep doing what you're doing and throwing the characters into situations to see what happens?

    I want to reiterate: I'm absolutely loving this story and can't wait for more. In this chapter, the internal view of Haley gradually justifying her actions to herself was pretty fantastic :D

    It's because her point of view, as explained in this chapter, is diametrically opposed to that of most people who frequent this subreddit. Most people here are more like Sean, they want to find out what ticks and they would want a good person to seize power and force everyone to cooperate.

    I know I would fall to the Ring. Not even a question.

    Because of that, and because the writer is good at showing her POV, it is less satisfying to the readers because they can't identify with it in the way they normally would.

    The position she espouses here is probably a good one for a real life rationalist in her position in the real world, but it is anathema to that of a rational fiction protagonist. And that's what people are here to read.

      Idk. I mean, she's a dragon lady! Dragon vs Superman should be more interesting than magic world, and that's when I don't even like HP that much. 

      Maybe make her indict her cat into the dnd party? Or mention dragon sexual frustration, or try to deal with her inlaws, or lay dragon eggs, or run into pathfinder warlocks and druids and gunslingers. 
      All hail SirPussInBoots!

    Oh, the shittiest of fanfics: Harry x Snape AND Draco x Rando! It's going to be fantastic while it lasts, which I don't think will be long.

    I think it's because Haley's story right now is dealing with the fallout from the last arc while also trying to set up the next arc, but Sean is having to deal with none of that and just sorta jumped right in to his arc without any baggage from the story prior; his story feels fresh and new.

    ```
    Its an original universe not fanfiction, and I wouldn't call it shitty, that just seems unnecessarily mean. Generally the rule is to try and make criticism constructive here.
    ```

    - u/ashinator92:
      ```
      Oh no. I was talking about the in universe harry x snape
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        Ah. I had a woosh moment there
        ```

- u/_immute_:
  ```
  Does anyone (perhaps OP) know of other good HP fics that develop a similar thesis on magic that Sarsap' does here?
  ```

  - u/FormerlySarsaparilla:
    ```
    I'm not aware of any, and I did spend some time looking, and trying to fit my conclusions to HP canon.
    ```

  - u/ketura:
    ```
    For Love of Magic, tho it's, uh, got metric *tons* of erotic stuff mixed in with it.
    ```

  - u/JackStargazer:
    ```
    There are a bunch that basically get to "magic is all about intent"
    ```

    - u/_immute_:
      ```
      I mean more specifically, where normal magic is palpable, wild, and strong, and there's a conspiracy to suppress it.
      ```
