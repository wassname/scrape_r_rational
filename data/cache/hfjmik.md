## Has anyone here read Peter Watts' Blindsight?

### Post:

*Blindsight* is a hard sci fi cosmic horror flavoured first contact story by author and marine biologist Peter Watts, about a crew of posthumans (along with their pet baseline interpretor) encountering a bizarre alien construct/organism beyond the edge of the Oort Cloud. It's probably most famous for its unique, wizard-killing take on vampires, positing them as a prehistoric subspecies of obligatory cannibals with savant level intelligence, but the core of the story is much more >!about the relationship between sapience and intelligence, and whether you need the first to have the other.!< It feels... relevant to this community's interest.

  I have seen it recommended here many times when people ask for novels, along with *Echopraxia*.

  General review from what I remember: I really enjoyed his take on vampires, and felt that the story neatly slid in to the cosmic horror genre without actually leaving sci-fi, which is a rare but laudable occurrence. The aliens are well formulated and the suspense is executed well in general, though I didn’t like the AI twist near the end. At the conclusion of reading it I felt like the book had effectively argued for the meaningfulness of the core self-awareness =//= intelligence premise. 

  On the other hand, the characters and much of the social speculation left much less of an impact, even considering  the interesting ideas that some of them were based around. Not they they were incompetently executed, just that they didn’t really compare to the other stuff in terms of being strikingly memorable.

    Very much so. It was an interesting exercise, but I left with no real reason to care about the characters or ideas.
    ```

    - u/blindsight:
      ```
      Yes, I agree. The narrative, while true to the protagonist's unusual thought processes, also makes the book harder to follow.

      It was an interesting book with some cool ideas, but it wasn't a book I particularly *enjoyed* reading.

      (Aside: my use of this username predates the book's publication by a few years, in case anyone is confused by my lukewarm opinion of the title.)

  That's what I actually enjoyed the most in this story. Vampires felt kind of beside the point, like an exercise in "how could I describe vampirism scientifically". But I didn't encounter the idea of self-awareness not being a prerequisite of intelligence anywhere else.

    Yeah, I think the vampires are a touch shoe-horned in the first book. Which kind of makes sense. The vampires owe their genesis to Watts being press-ganged at a con into a vampire panel, because they wanted a "hard sf" representative. The vampires were something he just sort of made up on the fly.

    So yeah, the vampires, to me at least, feel like a fun idea Watts was very fond of, but couldn't figure out a story for them specifically, so he added them into *Blindsight* for a good pop-culture hook. For what it's worth, I think they add a lot more to the sequel.

      Wow, didn't know that. Nice to see my intuition confirmed in such a way :)

      In the first book vampires tie into the theme of asking which traits give evolutionary advantage
      ```

      - u/King_of_Men:
        ```
        Yes, but the answer "not consciousness" could have been given entirely without fangs, vulnerability to right angles, or the v-word. Humans with intelligence but no consciousness could just as well be called 'zombies', or indeed 'werewolves'. The theme doesn't require vampires as the mythological monster to be resurrected.
        ```

        - u/crispin1:
          ```
          Sure, but you could also give that answer without writing a sci-fi novel or any novel at all. He fits the theme of everyone on the crew being very different, and reflecting on those differences supports the central theme. I admit I found it weird having a vampire in hard sci-fi but the weirdness of the book is one of its good aspects imo.

            I found the inclusion of the vampire to be a good insofar as it telegraphed from the beginning that this was really a horror novel at its heart.

          There are zombies in echophraxia.

          They are soldiers who have the ability to disable their consciousness to improve their combat capabilities.

      The Hive in Bruce Sterling's *Schizmatrix* (1985) also examines this idea.

    Thinking he was trying some thematic connection with the "can't see themselves in a mirror" or something like that.

    But yeah, on the whole, I was also a bit surprised by the intrusion of the vampire theme.
    ```

- u/crispin1:
  ```
  Yes. Really enjoyed it. I particularly liked the way none of the main characters are neurotypical. Well written aliens too, with a genuinely different form of thought to our own. Also plenty of great descriptive work to appeal to the science fan; +1 for turning 'coriolis' into a verb.

  Anyone planning to read it should know that discussions on this thread on the nature of intelligence etc may well turn into plot spoilers. OP may want to mark some of their post as such.

  Although I don't remember the details, I found myself disagreeing with his take on all that stuff. There was some assumption or other underlying the whole argument that I rejected. Didn't detract from my enjoyment of the book, though.

  Sapience is intelligence, the ability to understand the world in a sophisticated way. Sentience is the ability to experience the world via qualia, being conscious. Dogs are sentient, but not the most sapient, for example. Blindsight argues that we can be sapient without being sentient. 

  I really enjoyed the book. Its central premise is fascinating and thought provoking. I would recommend it.

- u/uwu-bob:

  It's definitely relevant here, and has already been recommended a lot. Try this google search:

      site:reddit.com/r/rational "blindsight"

  Personally I didn't like it. There was no character I could identify with and root for. It felt very dystopian. And I didn't find the book's premise that you can have deep intelligence without consciousness believable. To each their own..

    Speculation: did you like HPMOR?

    - u/uwu-bob:

      Yep I did, at least for 75% of the book. It got a bit long-winded. What was your theory?
      ```

      - u/FeepingCreature:

        Damn. I thought liking Siri would correlate with liking Harry.

        - u/crispin1:

          Anticorrelation here. Hpmor was too smartass for me overall. Possibly I didn't like that it reminded me of some of my own bad traits 😆. There were some good bits as well but I got bored and didn't finish it. 

          Fwiw I never read actual Harry Potter either and much though I wanted to like the films, felt they were made more for those who had read the books.
          ```

          - u/FeepingCreature:
            ```
            Maybe it's that Siri is more clearly signalled as "ineffective and untrusted" through the story.
            ```

            - u/crispin1:
              ```
              Hp was supposed to be that? 
              Siri had humility, and uncertainty about his role both in the mission and the world in general. That made him likable.
              ```

              - u/FeepingCreature:
                ```
                HP was supposed to come across as awesome but hint at underlying issues, which you had to slightly pay attention to pick up. (Because HPMOR is a coming of age novel...) Siri reads more like ... he doesn't come across as humble so much as handicapped. Also he's part of a competent military command structure so there tends to be less of the "arguments with authorities" that turn people off in HPMOR? I'd say that one depends on whether you believe Sarasti on Siri externalizing his disdain for Sarasti's authority. But I mean, they both have a dark side and a seemingly logical/explicit approach papering over social deficiencies and self-unawareness. I feel like they'd be good friends.

                  I read Siri differently but agree him and HP would likely get along!

    I think it's *meant* to be dystopian. This is a world without hope, or heroes, where an increasing percent of its population is flat-out opting out. IMO echopraxia makes it even darker.
    ```

  - u/Zarohk:
    ```
    Exactly, it didn’t feel like the characters were relatable, they just accepted dystopia as normal, and the “intelligence without consciousness” felt more like the characters and/or author simply finding aliens’ consciousness too, well, alien to recognize. I enjoyed the explanation of Chinese Box A.I. and the vampires though.
    ```

    - u/Transcendent_One:

      > they just accepted dystopia as normal

      Actually, I would expect that of most people living in a dystopia, real or fictional.

  You know what's sad? I can totally see vampirism being marketed as an autism cure. Like, how many parents would pick "superhuman sociopath" over "son who doesn't do eye contact well"?
  ```

  - u/WhispersOfSeaSpiders:
    ```
    For correctness, Siri Keeton (the protagonist) isn't a vampire. He's a human who had radical surgery performed on him as a child.

    Sarasti, the captain of the ship, is a vampire- he's a completely different species that humans used biotechnology to resurrect. Neurologically, the book implies that vampires are less sentient than humans but have the advantage of multiple simultaneous thoughts occuring in parallel.

    Vampirism isn't a treatment, it's being a completely different species.
    ```

    - u/Wizard-of-Woah:
      ```
      Oh, I didn't meant to imply Siri was a vampire. I was referring to the fact that, in the background material, it's revealed the vampire genotype was discovered in an attempt to cure autism with a retrovirus, which resulted in the first human test subject--an autistic nine year old--becoming a vampire. The idea being that autistic traits are at least in part a legacy of vampiric genetics. Savant skills and all that.

            This was great, by the way. The researchers certainly sell hard the idea that this was a cure for autism.

  I liked it as a sci-fi but didn't liked it as a book. The ideas are great the execution is so-so. It felt disjointed and I wasn't empathizing with any character.

- u/Wizard-of-Woah:
  ```
  I will say this, I kinda wish we'd gotten to see inside a posthuman's head at some point. Maybe Valerie the vampire in the sequel? I know they're supposed to be incomprehensible, but xenofiction is a proud literary tradition.
  ```

  - u/callmesalticidae:
    ```
    It isn't that they're incomprehensible per se, but that they're far smarter than the author is, and Watts recognizes that it's very difficult to write characters who are much more intelligent than you are.
    ```

- u/Freevoulous:
  ```
  I was torn about this book, as on all Watts books.

  One one hand, the writing is brilliant, the plot is masterfully crafted and the world and ideas are just perfect in their sci-fi hardness.

  On the other hand, the characters are all unlikable, the tone is bleak and depressing, and the whole theme borderlines on grimdark.

  I would say that reading Blindsight was an absolute thrilling experience, but not a pleasant one.
