  I'm thinking maybe we should start cross-posting these threads directly to the PGtE subreddit?

  The quality of discussion isn't much different anyway, and that's way you're not splitting up the discussion as much.

    I'm okay with that. I just picked up the posts because the last few chapters didn't get posted, but I'm kind of Reddit-stupid in terms of most functionality of the site. I just come here for discussions and notifications of new works or updates to existing works.
    ```

      Or crosspost from there to here.  There is a lot less discussion in this subreddit, so might as well make the main post in the dedicated place.
      ```

  New chapter is up! Enjoy!  


  Nine, but only if EE doesn't try to sink the Cat + Hanno ship.

  Information about the Titans is interesting.

  It's a trap! That bridge is going to be part of a Xanatos gambit, isn't it?

  "With my high initiative, I throw the Mirror Knight at the ship before they have a chance to react"

  Is gathering everyone at the Arsenal going to backfire, especially if Cat is a powder keg?

  Speaking of... alright, Cat, it's story time.

  Defeating the enemy by yeeting the Mirror Knight at them is delightful.

  ```
  I feel like I missed something. Who is Dread Empress Schepulshral? Akuas whole family is dead so is it the closest Sahelian? Heiress of Wolof?

  Seems like a plot that is unlikely to succeed.

    ```
    Sepulchral was identified in Chapter 7 as the former High Lady Mirembe. Cat at least thinks it's possible that she's being backed/used by the Black Knight in his campaign against Malicia, since he hasn't made much else in the way of overt attacks.

    I think the time skip was three months, which was enough time for the fallout of the diplomatic conference at the end of the last book to settle in and shake things up a little.
