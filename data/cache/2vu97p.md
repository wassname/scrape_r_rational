## Are there any rational self-help forums?

### Post:

I have a problem that I'm struggling with and nothing I do to solve it is working and I'm hitting my head against the wall and I'm trying very hard not to throw my hands in the air and give up. It seems like whatever's preventing me from solving the problem must be a conceptual limitation of some kind, since all the alternative explanations I can think of either seem really unlikely or don't seem to quite make sense, but for the life of me I can't figure out what that conceptual limitation could be. I've spoken to a lot of people about the problem and nothing they've suggested seems to work. Does anyone know of a rational self-help forum they can point me to?

Thanks!

  You could try posting about your problem here. We mostly visit this sub for interesting materials relating to rationality or use rationality to investigate hypothetical scenarios. But what's the difference between dealing with hypothetical and real problems? Just post your problem here, and the worst thing that can happen is that no one can help or you'll be politely requested to not do it again. Mistakes should be forgiven, but I don't see why it'd be a problem at all in the first place.

  Alternatively you could PM me, I'd be willing to give some free advice or a different perspective.

    While I agree in principle, this is a rationalist *fiction* sub. OP could edit his post to include the problem though since that won't clutter us up any more.

    It could definitely be fun to be given a real-world problem and see various approaches to solving it from different users.

  [LessWrong](http://lesswrong.com), while not precisely a self-help forum, seems like it could help.

    I second this. OP could post in [one of the Open Threads](http://lesswrong.com/r/discussion/lw/lov/open_thread_feb_9_feb_15_2015/). [Here](http://lesswrong.com/r/discussion/lw/lk6/open_thread_jan_19_jan_25_2015/bw5w) is an example of someone asking for help there.

  I'd recommend /r/Stoicism and the Stoic philosophy in general. YMMV as to how LW-style rational it is, but it's certainly a lot more rational than many other programs, and it's procured lots of positive results. Check it out if you want. And best of luck in your journey.
