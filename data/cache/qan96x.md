Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  The Perfect Run just wrapped up this weekend. It's a time loop superhero story that sort of reminds me of a cross between Worm and Mother of Learning. Protag at the beginning is kind of maniac hedonist as a coping mechanism for his isolation, but matures over the course of the story as he learns about the situation, gains friends and allies, during his quest to get the timeline as he wants in the eponymous Perfect Run.

  Idk if it'll be remembered in five years as MoL and Work will continue to be, but enjoyable enough.

  Also, i saw ar kendrythist wrapped up the latest book. Can somebody spoil me with a plot synopsis if you've read it? I want closure of what's happening with the world and characters, but I don't have it in me to keep reading that much prose with that pacing

    I also enjoyed Perfect Run. A lot wackier, more comedic than Worm - if anyone has read Super Minion, it's a lot closer to the tone of that, but with time loops.

    Regarding AK's latest book, it's not an easy book to summarize since Book 5 has been fairly light, local and more slice of life - perhaps unsurprisingly after book 4's end. I'll put the rest in spoilers:

    >!The book starts with Erik and co "politely forced" to leave Spur, so Erik resolves to go on holiday and start on the Wordly Path to unlock Gate!<

    >!First stop is Treehome, the Orcol city. Various hijinks ensue, but the main one is Erik deciding to again flex his powers to start wiping out various monsters and catching serial killers, which leads to some major conflict. Next is a few chapters with Tenebrae, the grumpy archmage, which are mostly focused on learning magic and Gate, along with some setup for book 6 involving dragons.!<

    >!The meat of the book takes place in Nelboor, an East Asian inspired country. At first, the group try to remain incognito, but as they inevitably get drawn into local problems, Erik is revealed. This then is a spark to kick off a major war. Erik is nearly killed, but survives to slaughter the attacking force, strengthening his resolve to take more actions for good in the world. At the end, Erik leaves Nelboor having taken a major step towards Gate - along with a bunch of other new magics - and book 6 looks set to be all about the secretive dragon societies of Veird!<

    Hunter x Hunter is popular for having very high highs, strong worldbuilding and a nice endpoint.
    While in retrospect some parts are slower and somewhat inconsequential to the main plot on a first watch with everything being new information this is less of a problem.

    The only HxH fanfiction I have read is [Myrmidon](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/myrmidon-naruto-hunter-x-hunter.554373/reader/) which is kinda similar in that it has a very intriguing start and good conclusion but felt slightly sluggish somewhere in the middle. I consider it good enough that I have read it twice despite its length. 

    Slight warning that as a hxh/naruto crossover it also contains what I expect are both Boruto and hxh manga spoilers. Having read neither of those I'm unsure but was caught off guard by things mentioned late in the story. Could very well be a personal thing, but couldn't hurt to mention I figured.

      Seconding Myrmidon. It's one of the best crossovers I've ever read.

    - u/netstack_:
      ```
      I absolutely loved Myrmidon, but stopped reading it when >!the climactic battle with Meruem is revealed to be an upgraded version of a Shadow Clone!<. I felt a bit cheated at that point; it didn't change my enjoyment of the earlier parts, but I didn't want to see how bad things were going to get once that advantage was revealed.

  Blankets by Craig Thompson is a pretty good graphic novel.  I was sceptical for a long time because of the blurb stating part of it was the author's exploration of his faith and Christian upbringing, but it was a very enjoyable read.

    They did a short an unfinished Worm quest on SV under the same name, but other than that, no. I'm quite certain it's a intended-impenetrable psuedonym of someone who suspected they might not want their real name attached to a pornographic eroge litRPG quest, no matter how good such a work might turn out to be. Those are not content tags you can justify  to your grandma/boss/sponsors/children/citizens in the same way you can brush off writing, for example, a Harry Potter fanfic. 

    I suspect I know who it is, and if I'm correct, you'll find works in a similar voice if you hang around here long enough.

  I recommend [Soulmonger](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/46637/soulmonger), the new story by Macronomicon, author of Wake of the Ravager and Generic System, both of which have made the rounds here. It's an urban fantasy with necromancy, demon summoning and time travel. Also a healthy dose of humor, like his other stuff. As with all this guy's stories, you can expect clever, skillful writing and smart magic usage abound. 

  I really like this story's time travel power. The protagonist has the ability to relive everyday a second time when he goes to sleep, only nothing he does the second time around has  an effect on "reality" when he wakes up. It's basically [l'esprit de l'escalier](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%27esprit_de_l%27escalier) made into a magic power, which is delicious.  It's the kind of power where the utility extracted depends entirely being smart and careful and methodical. A dumb person with the power will just live a regular life, a smart person will become a billionaire or something in 20 years. And that's not even taking into account combining it with the other magical powers! Perfect for my tastes.
  ```

  - u/GaBeRockKing:
    ```
    Oh man, I'm not sure if I'll ultimately end up reading the story, but I'm absolutely in love with the premise for the power. It's just so *clever*! Like, I can tell that it's an inherently breakeable ability, but it's not a *broken* ability-- its limitations and advantages are immediately obvious.

    Does it seem like he's actually going to finish this story? I'm a little tired of him starting long story arcs, and then dropping them when he gets bored.
    ```

    - u/GlueBoy:
      ```
      Seeing as how he changed his "business model" and is now writing in order to publish novels on Kindle Unlimited rather than solely milking Patreon subs, I'd say the chance is decently high he'll finish this one.

      His other in progress work has three published novels on KU, for example.

    Cradle by Will Wight may fit your criteria. It's a western author's take on xianxia (chinese mythology-inspired high fantasy), about a "muggle" in a world of DBZ-style supernatural martial artists who's entire schtick is that he's basically the World's Most Determined Man as he trains himself into a powerhouse. First two books are a bit rough, but it takes major jumps in quality in books #3, #5, and #8 IMO.

    First 6 books are free on amazon right now btw

    https://www.amazon.com/gp/kindle/series/B093Y42FNL/ref=st_kb_B01LWSS758

    Btw if you're like me where you like "Muggle in a world of wizards" plotlines, here's a few I talked about + how their stories handle them (e.g. super-powered late bloomer, anti-magic, batman-esque prep, etc.). Mega spoilers obviously

    Focusing on the second sentence more than the first here, but there was the story in last week's recommendation thread about a world where everyone has superpowers, and the protagonist has nothing beyond bullshiting through life pretending to be clairvoyant. I haven't read it myself though.

  ```
  I want something that doesn't feel hideously unjust and unfair due to societal factors, like Pith or Worm. I want something where everyone's basically good and fighting (victoriously) against an unfair world instead of being crushed by an unfair society. What should I read?

  - u/BavarianBarbarian_:
    ```
    Hoo boy. I can't tell whether you'd love or hate [Pale](https://palewebserial.wordpress.com/about/). The story is definitely about a group of good characters fighting against a shitty world. However, the story is also pretty realistic in showing why this system has endured for thousands of years, and how it's very resistent to attempts to change it.  
    I will say that by and large, it's Wildbow's least depressing work so far.

    The non-spoilery TL;DR is that in an urban fantasy settings, three 13 year old girls are Awakened to magic by the Others (non-human magic beings) of their small Canadian town in order to investigate the murder of one of those Others.
    ```

  - u/netstack_:
    ```
    I had a much harder time finding examples of this than I expected. Maybe something more slice-of-life like Konosuba would do it, since characters tend to band together against outside forces and the overall situation isn't so grim?

    For a more off-the-wall rec, I think [Shinji and Warhammer 40k](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3886999/1/Shinji_and_Warhammer40k) actually counts. The social alienation and abuse of canon *Evangelion* tends to get crushed under the metaphorical treads of a 40k mindset. Villains tend to get crushed under the *literal* treads of a 40k mindset, but it turns out they're better at escalating physical conflict than they are at social conflict. The end result is a batshit insane plot that's actually kind of uplifting.
    ```

  - u/CaramilkThief:
    ```
    Ar'kendrythist has morally good characters in an unfair world. Sometimes the problems are due to societal factors, other times it's the world itself that is the cause of conflict.

    Monroe also has mostly good characters, and characters in power that aren't corrupt beyond all recognition. It has one of the only litrpgs I've seen where the system makes the world actively better.

      >Monroe also has mostly good characters, and characters in power that aren't corrupt beyond all recognition. It has one of the only litrpgs I've seen where the system makes the world actively better.

      Is [this](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/35398/monroe) the story you are talking about?

      Your description makes it sound like something I'd enjoy reading, but I'd like to know more before adding it to my 'to read' list. Unfortunately the author's blurb doesn't really give any info about the plot; from the blurb I couldn't even tell that it's a litrpg.

      If you don't mind, can you give me a small synopsis of the story without spoilers?
      ```

      - u/Izeinwinter:
        ```
        First chapter is "White Victimhood, the Saga".  Given that this is barely present for the rest of what I have read so far, it seems like the author was/is actively trying to drive away a subset of readers.
        ```

        - u/fljared:
          ```
          While this could just be the author expressing their views, I do sometimes wonder if this is a purposeful strategy to get only the audience you want. Compare and contrast that Zero HP Lovecraft story from a month or two ago, where the first page was a dozen different right wing shibboleths, and then a comparatively unrelated sci-fi horror story.
          ```

          - u/chiruochiba:
            ```
            Judging by the responses I've gotten so far, I'm a member of that subset that would be driven away.

            Does the 'white victimhood' part of the story cut out only after the main character gets isekaid? I've seen plenty of stories where the author uses the first chapter to setup how *unfair* real-life is to his Red Pill inspired protagonist, and then the whinging only cuts out after he gets transported to a reality that caters to his desire for self-importance.
            ```

            - u/Izeinwinter:
              ```
              .. If you want to start with a protagonist whos life sucks enough that they dont mind being iskaied, the Iskai mechanism really needs to be something that *sorts* for that. 

              Because otherwise you are asking people to accept two high improbabilities in the origin story. 
              Billions of people on the planet. You main character can have nearly any arbitrary back story of woe, if the iskai mechanism is "Summoner did divination to find candidates who would gleefully volunteer to be yanked out of their world with no return ticket"
              ```

        - u/IICVX:
          ```
          The first chapter is just upsetting: the main character works at a super collider that, somehow, __isn't__ a sausage fest - and that's a bad thing, because the woman in charge is exactly like every other discovery-stealing incompetent PI, regardless of gender. And then there's casual transphobia. 

          The author goes out of his way to create an unrealistic situation for the MC to be a victim in and even then it's literally just business as usual for most bad labs, except the reader is supposed to be extra sympathetic because the antagonist is a younger minority woman.
          ```

      - u/ivory12:
        ```
        If you're looking for an actual story, I would avoid. Moderate spoilers follow. 

        More screen time is given to the titular cat being pet than anything approaching plot, sometimes. It seems like every interaction the main character has with other townsfolk has to be documented, and every one of those interactions has to comment on his cat somehow.

        Which means after a promising start (if you ignore the bizarre first chapter) the story falls into a rut and crawls along at a glacial pace. Actual fantasy elements are skimmed over in the most cursory detail, like so:  
        >Bob spent twelve hours killing three thousand scorpion monsters.

        That's not an actual quote, but it might as well be.

        Even at it's most descriptive the combat never really gets beyond Bob churning through monsters like he's grinding a pokemon game, and the magic rarely gets fleshed out beyond words on a status box.

        If you want to read about a probably-autistic (this is alluded to by one of the other characters) socially stunted physics PhD optimizing the numbers on his character sheet and being obsessed with his cat, this is the story for you.

        It had glimmers of promise, but personally I couldn't recommend it to anyone. The author desperately needs to take onboard Vonnegut's old piece of writing advice: "every sentence must either reveal character or advance the action." There was a particular action sequence we had to see back to back to back from three or four perspectives. And later, again, when the memory of it was used to make a point to another character. It was that last passage that caused me to drop the story, personally. That and the omnipresent cat.
        ```

      - u/CaramilkThief:
        ```
        Yup that's the story. I agree though, the synopsis isn't very good. Monroe has a pretty divisive first chapter since it tries to make political commentary in a way that isn't really convincing, but the rest of the story never touches back on it so you can kinda disregard all of it. 

        The story is about nuclear scientist Bob who through some experimental shenanigans gets transported to another world. After that he is picked up by some locals and slowly walked through their system, getting levels, equipment, making builds, etc. As the first earth human in their universe, Bob gets access to a system administrator, which gives him some unique advantages in terms of buildcrafting, but nothing OP. 

        The system is the crunchiest I've ever read. It's like a homebrew DnD system with very well defined builds, spells, stats. Spells do x damage, people have y health, objects have z durability, etc. But it's designed in such a way that the system encourages technological and societal growth. It's hard to explain without spoiling all aspects of it, but basically there's incentive to not fight against other system users (like humans) without a *really good reason.* A small group of level 20+ people can build a settlement in the middle of nowhere, and thrive. Someone can live the rest of their lives comfortably by delving dungeons (safely!) 10-12 hours a week. And so on. It's a really well designed system, and explored pretty thoroughly. 

        The tone of the story is mostly slice of life, with some moments of a little action. Things happen and move forward, but it isn't blood pumping action or espionage or thriller or anything. I'd recommend it.
