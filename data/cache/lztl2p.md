  Well, it’s about time someone realized “the World to the Strong” doesn’t include them when Piccolo is in the picture.

    Too late for Piano, though. At least he died having seen his dream fulfilled.

      I'm impressed that he took the heat for Violin. Guess he really did care about her.

    That would also be a good alternative title

  I suspect that Piccolo's unyielding rage is metaphysically significant. After all, Piccolo is the castoff, "evil" parts of Kami. Anger was probably one of the big things Kami got rid off, which would make it very central to Piccolo's behavior and identity. It's entirely possible that he can't ever stop being angry, especially since Kami would have kept the more positive behaviors and emotions.

  If this is true, it would imply interesting things about Kami. Namely, that he might be incapable of experiencing anger in the same way that Piccolo might be perpetually angry. On paper this might sound good, but I can't imagine removing such a foundational emotion would be an entirely positive thing. It might be why he's seemingly okay with sitting up in the Lookout and just watching as the Instruments bring Piccolo back.

  This is a shit ton of speculation though, so we'll have to see how it holds up as we learn more about Piccolo and Kami (whenever he shows up).

  Alternative title: >!"I never thought the Demon King would smash MY face!," cries ptero who created, rallied and led to victory the Demon King Smashing People's Faces Party.!<

  >!Does this little time trickery could mean that dragon in fact cloned the container from its state 300 years ago and the real container with real piccolo is still at athe bottom of the ocean?!<

  I think not, because it's clearly stated that he accelerated the time, but I don;t know if u/SimoneNonvelodico considered going a slightly different option with it.

  Great chapter, it seems that Violin is not happy with her new friend
  ```

  - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
    ```
    >!No, he did just what he says. It's barely skirting the rules because while the time acceleration *is* an effect that was set in the past from the future, the inside of the container was effectively isolated from the rest of the world until it's opened, *after* the wish is expressed. Which means in fact the dragon did not send information from the future to the past, and did not create any real time paradox (besides the information that he himself gathered about the wish having been granted). About the gods' ban on time travel, I'm taking inspiration from the various things said to this effect in Dragon Ball Super's Goku Black/Zamasu arc.!<

  By the way, I just realized how much Yamcha screwed.

  >!He had enough time to mutter "Dragon, make me strong enough to". So he could use this time to say something shorter, for example, "Dragon, go away", or "Dragon, kill him"... that way he could suceed, altough it depends on how eager dragon is to grant wish of random person!<
  ```

  - u/JJReeve:
    ```
    I'd have gone with, "Dragon, help me!"
    Of course this places a lot of trust in the dragon actually being an excellent wish granter as it gets to decide both what you need help with and how to provide it.
    ```

    - u/Slinkinator:
      ```
      It sounds like the dragon would've asked for clarification. IMO
      ```

  - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
    ```
    >!"Dragon, kill Piccolo" wouldn't work. The dragon canonically can't destroy beings more powerful than him - or most Dragon Ball arcs would be tremendously short. And Piccolo IS more powerful in terms of sheer strength - well, besides being technically half of his creator.!<

    EDIT: >!Sorry, realised you meant Blue/Flute. That could actually have worked, I guess. In canon the dragon has never been used to kill, though. Perhaps an umbrella "no kill wishes" rule would make a bit more sense.!<

  What did they even expect
  ```

- u/Dezoufinous:
  ```
  ok so let's set up expectations for next chapter:>!- Violin talks to Baba and they somehow try to bail out of Piccolo inner circle

  * >!Tien and Chiaotzu swear revenge and maybe joins forces with our heroes, it seems like a good start of their redemption arc!<
  * >!Bulma gets in contact with HQ and gets the bad news!<
  * >!Yamcha reports back to HQ!<
  * >!Flute (Blue) is the biggest unknown here, but the only reasonable explanation is that he is following Yamcha now. Or maybe he will try to use his little force on Piccolo and fail miserably!<
  * >!Goku is getting retrieved and healed!<
  * >!\- And Piccolo will be... Piccolo!<
