  Yessss.

  Buffy vamps always were unbelievably stupid, which was always one of the things I least liked about the series.

  I love me a competent pragmatic immoral protagonist.

  Edit: A competent pragmatic immoral protagonist that does SCIENCE! On people. Mostly on innocent people.

  That's an impressive number of posts considering it's only been up a week.

  Edit: This is very good quality. I like it. It is interesting to read a character that legitimately does not care about morality whatsoever. Like, normally people at least angst about doing terrible things afterwards but this guy just doesn't give a crap.

    Reddit has long been a hot spot for conversation on the internet. About 57 million people visit the site every day to chat about topics as varied as makeup, video games and pointers for power washing driveways.

    In recent years, Reddit’s array of chats also have been a free teaching aid for companies like Google, OpenAI and Microsoft. Those companies are using Reddit’s conversations in the development of giant artificial intelligence systems that many in Silicon Valley think are on their way to becoming the tech industry’s next big thing.

    Now Reddit wants to be paid for it. The company said on Tuesday that it planned to begin charging companies for access to its application programming interface, or A.P.I., the method through which outside entities can download and process the social network’s vast selection of person-to-person conversations.

    “The Reddit corpus of data is really valuable,” Steve Huffman, founder and chief executive of Reddit, said in an interview. “But we don’t need to give all of that value to some of the largest companies in the world for free.”

    The move is one of the first significant examples of a social network’s charging for access to the conversations it hosts for the purpose of developing A.I. systems like ChatGPT, OpenAI’s popular program. Those new A.I. systems could one day lead to big businesses, but they aren’t likely to help companies like Reddit very much. In fact, they could be used to create competitors — automated duplicates to Reddit’s conversations.

    Reddit is also acting as it prepares for a possible initial public offering on Wall Street this year. The company, which was founded in 2005, makes most of its money through advertising and e-commerce transactions on its platform. Reddit said it was still ironing out the details of what it would charge for A.P.I. access and would announce prices in the coming weeks.

    Reddit’s conversation forums have become valuable commodities as large language models, or L.L.M.s, have become an essential part of creating new A.I. technology.

    L.L.M.s are essentially sophisticated algorithms developed by companies like Google and OpenAI, which is a close partner of Microsoft. To the algorithms, the Reddit conversations are data, and they are among the vast pool of material being fed into the L.L.M.s. to develop them.

    Regarding protagonist’s amorality: in Buffy Universe becoming a vampire means that the original person “dies” and a “soulless” demon inhabits their body afterwards. Being “soulless” in turn means that a vampire doesn’t care much about morality and generally lacks compassion and empathy. 

    There was a lot of drama strewn around this with two major characters. I’m guessing later on Jack will either recover his soul or discover that it’s gradually “recovering” with time.

      I know, it's an interesting mechanic, isn't it?

  Quite good so far. Haven't read a sociopathic SI before, and finding it quite interesting. Not that he really counts as SI now, I suppose.
  ```

    ```
    Eh, it's still got the important SI elements. Memories, exploitation of those memories, examination of in-universe elements in the context of our universe, etc.
    ```

  Little help here, what's all of [BTVS SI] stand for?

  I've watched all of Buffy, way back when, and just tried reading this. It seems interesting, think I'm going to keep going, but I'm confused. Either I'm forgetting a ton of Buffy (which is very possible) or all this starling / mother / father stuff is not part of Buffy cannon?

  Thanks.
