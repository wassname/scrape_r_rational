  These are things real people already are fine with. Especially the author of 3WC. Polyamory and the rational community in the Bay area have large overlap from what I've heard.

  And being gay *really* isn't something shocking anymore. In Iceland there was a lesbian prime minister while the Vice Chancellor of Germany between 2009 and 2011 was gay while ruling in tandem with Merkel's conservative party. Doesn't really scream 'morally unfathomable' to the author's readership when it should be expected almost common place in a generation or two.

  >The Impossible Possible World has teleporters which work by scanning the subject, re-constructing him at the intended destination using a high-tech matter-energy beam, and finally burning the original subject alive.

  Star Trek already does that. How many people are horrified by Star Trek?

  >Once, there was magic, but a government decided to eliminate all magical items, places, and people because magic was just too big of a threat to humanity.

  That has nothing to do with morality, nor is it shocking since we have no context of what has been lost. Either the newly discovered magic *was* that dangerous, in which case it is sad but completely understandable and agreeable, or it could have been made safe, in which case that's just dumb.

  >Robot slaves

  Makes the whole point of wanting to save baby eater children moot. Why care about the welfare of completely alien but sentient creatures if we don't care about our own homegrown sentient aliens?

  >Human slaves, who are later mind-wiped of their misery in slavery and given freedom again, which makes it okay.

  This may be a decent one.

  >It's okay to rape... we've all been genetically engineered not to care.

  Makes the whole crisis of the Super Happy Fun people moot. The whole point is that humans are horrified by them because they engineered away their capacity for pain and discomfort. You're proposing that humans could have done the same, in which case why be bothered that some superior aliens already went a bit further?

  >Sex robots (because sex robots are actually happening and I think it's a bit disgusting, but it seems like people are going to get used to them.)

  Sentient? If no, what's the problem? If yes, do they enjoy the task they were given and do they get the right to self-determination within the frame of their artificial value system? If yes, what's the problem. If no, see my point regarding robot slaves.

    Star Trek handwaves a soul-alike stored in pattern buffers. The original subject and the transmitted copy can't exist at the same time because something something pattern buffer something. There are rare exceptions when this breaks down, but there's always some phlebotinum to explain it.
    ```

    - u/HallowedThoughts:
      ```
      A good example of how this could be horrifying is the movie The Prestige. The main character gets his hands on a teleporter, but it leaves behind a copy that he rigs a death trap for
      ```

        I believe Kim Stanley Robinson did that schtick first with "Think like a Dinosaur".

        More recently a book I won't name because I can't dis-recommend it enough had a schtick that the whole world teleport network ran like that _and somehow it was still a secret_. I gave up partway through because everyone was juggling deluxe gold plated idiot balls.

        If I got my hands on a device that duplicated me, I could think of way more interesting uses than faking a teleporter.

        For duplicative teleportation where you don't kill the original: _Rogue Moon_ (Budrys, 1960) _The Saga of Cuckoo_ (Pohl/Williamson 1975), "A Just Peace" (Vinge, 1971). Interestingly, in all of these the duplicate at the far end is considered expendable.
        ```

  ```
  The fact that the original story makes people squirm for "alternatives" is precisely why none of the proposed alternatives would accomplish the same purpose.
  ```

  - u/wren42:
    ```
    only if the purpose of the story is to make people squirm.  I think it distracts from the actual point and interesting parts of the story for a small throwaway scene.  I've avoided recommending the story to people I know would enjoy it based on a couple paragraphs.  it's a shame.
    ```

    - u/CeruleanTresses:
      ```
      Yeah. It's like, I know the narrative intent is to replicate the kind of discomfort someone from the past would feel about present-day social norms. But we're primed to think of more recent social developments as improvements--like, "we were wrong before, but now we've figured out that it's okay to XYZ." So when a story proposes a future that isn't explicitly dystopian, and an abhorrent (to us) social change is described as following that same "we were wrong but now we know" pattern, it *feels* like it's saying that social progress will inevitably lead to socially acceptable rape because rape is actually totally fine. And I'm hesitant to recommend a work of fiction to someone if I know I'm going to have to awkwardly explain that the author doesn't *really* support rape, I promise, yes I know how it sounds but *actually...*
      ```

      - u/wren42:

        precisely.  It annoyed me enough I actually do want to write an alternative to share with people (and did a draft last year.)  I might actually take another stab using the "parenting" idea.   I could envision a future society outlawing private parenting, as it could lead to non-egalitarian results and be construed as child abuse. it's also similar to the baby-eater situation.  the problem is it removes some of the cultural attachment to children which is leveraged in the story.

    That's why I picked it, because unlike rape it's not amoral, it's just a bit weird, and it's even already happening. Just like Akon having boyfriends.

    If this seems too already-accepted for this list, you should know that where I live, people here are pretty anti-LGBT, and never talk about sex robots. Except for me, I'm pro LGBT and am currently discussing sex robots on Reddit.

    See http://grantland.com/hollywood-prospectus/we-are-living-in-a-robot-moment-rejoice-cower-and-copulate/ for why people care.
    ```

- u/scruiser:
  ```
  Abortion is illegal.  100% effective birth control is free and people are properly educated on its usage.  Healthcare is free and effective as well.  Thus the socio-economic reasons modern day progressives have for making abortion legal are not as strong.
  ```

  - u/gbear605:
    ```
    Really, I don’t think anyone would care that much. In principle, sure, people think that you should be able to have an abortion at any time throughout the pregnancy. In (this alternative) reality, only the people who want to get pregnant will and they won’t need to get abortions. It’s essentially a nonissue and it’s hardly jarring. 

    It’s also not a very good one because this applies to a society that many people today are familiar with (pre-1960s US, some other countries), while Yudkowsky was looking for something that no country ever has legalized or found acceptable.

      Still better than OP but I think if you want the same shock value you either need to forbid something we consider vital (people are arrested for acting as parents, children are raised communaly) or allow something we consider intrinsically horrible to the same degree( in which case we're back where we started)
      ```

- u/wren42:

  I had the same concerns, and I actually wrote an alternative here:

  https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/66bdwj/proposed_edited_interlude_chapter_for_three/

  I don't think it's optimal, though I think something along the lines of Abortion is useful since it's topical to the babyeating.

  I haven't read that yet, but let me make some suggestions. None of that seems all that bad.

  What about kidnapping someone and using their body as an incubator to grow spare organs?

  Brain to brain data transfer so you can grab somebody, steal all their memories, wipe them clean, and steal all their liquid possessions.

  Transferring minds into other bodies custom built for the purpose seems like it could be horribly abused. Build something with the intent that the person suffer, and put them in it. Like a body that has a strong imbalance which gives it a near irresistable urge to commit autocannibalism. Give their body to your girlfriend and fuck in front of them. (This one is just body horror+rape but i couldn't help adding it in.)

  Incorporating still living people into your furniture.

  That's all I have right now. Hope you like the extras.
