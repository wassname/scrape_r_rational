  Orochimaru being portrayed very well here. Loving it so far.

    Yeah, I like seeing an Orochimaru that isn't a complete and obvious psychopath. Even if he is one... he's portrayed as intelligent here in a way that was only ever informed.

  Okay Orichimaru the plan Denier is so far the best character in this fic, possibly any Naruto fic ever, what with his friendly goody free technique baiting and problem solving. More of him please. And is it possible for Naruto and co to just fly/jump really high to run away, and then flap/glide on some sort of chakra sheathed wings?

  Now for the other mater.

  How rational, rationalist and scientifically accurate will this new superhero story be? 
  Will there equal intelligent division so that everyone (and i mean everyone who has a reason to be involved) is allowed to be smart, what's the scale of events and how long will the story be? Also what mood, if any, will it be written in? Happy fun times, spy/inteligence thriller, grimdarkedgy, interpersonal drama or something else?

    > And is it possible for Naruto and co to just fly/jump really high

    Fly, no.  Jump, yes.  Higher for Naruto than the others, lowest for Hinata.

    > to run away

    No.  Jumping is a standard ninja travel mode in certain terrain.  Whatever the team can do for traveling, the Sound nin can also do. 

    > and then flap/glide on some sort of chakra sheathed wings?

    No.

    > How rational, rationalist and scientifically accurate will this new superhero story be?

    Respectively:  very, where appropriate, as much as I can make it after you grant the existence of physics-defying superpowers

    > Will there equal intelligent division so that everyone (and i mean everyone who has a reason to be involved) is allowed to be smart

    Yes.

    > what's the scale of events 

    Reply hazy, ask again later.  Less than world-destroying, more than local.

    > and how long will the story be?

    As currently envisioned, long.  I have several novels worth of ideas. It depends on sales; I'm making a living on my writing now and can't afford too many non-profitable projects. Project Anko is the only thing I intend to do for free long-term. 

    > Also what mood, if any, will it be written in? Happy fun times,

    No.

    > spy/inteligence thriller, 

    Somewhat.

    > grimdarkedgy, 

    No.

    > interpersonal drama 

    Somewhat.

      How similar would you say you plan it on being to Worm?
      ```

        ```
        EDIT: On a phone, can't make multi-line spoilers work. Here be Worm spoilers. 

        > How similar would you say you plan it on being to Worm?

        Pretty much not at all aside from "real world + superpowers". Worm was a groundbreaking work with some really interesting characters and ideas. It is justifiably popular and has (at least partially) spawned a new genre. It also had quite a few failings: 

        * Only Taylor was allowed to munchkin her powers
        * Power creep was off the charts and fighting gods is boring
        * The entire concept of super powered people putting on costumes to fight / commit crimes / stop crimes is ridiculous. See '[CutLexLuthorACheck](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutLexLuthorACheck)' for why. Even if they DO decide to commit crimes, a brightly colored set of tights and broad daylight is just stupid compared to dark colors at night
        * The only reason Wildbow could find to justify this stupid behavior was 'alien worms infest their brains and make them do stupid things' which is a narrative cheat of the highest order
        * Many of the villains (esp. Slaughterhouse 9) were [EvilForTheLulz](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz)
        * Wildbow set up this interesting idea of parallel dimensions with parallel people, mentioned trade between them, and then never did a damn thing with that until literally the last few pages. The only place where parallel dimensions were really used was people-less evacuation points -- basically, glorified bomb shelters
        * Wildbow established an interesting, articulate, inventive protagonist with a cool but not overwhelming power set that she used cleverly. He then turned her into a mute with a completely different and overwhelming power set and made her be the [OneTrueSavior](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne), the only person who could save the day against the final boss.

          Is it okay to marry people based on reddit comments? Because I think you earned my love with that post there.

          All joking aside I am loving that you're going to avoid all the bad's of Worm. 

          I disagree with costume opinion though.
          What do you feed a 600 pound Gorilla? Anything it wants!
          What does a pyromancer wear? Anything it wants!

          If anything supers should wear what's most comfortable to them and what they like. I don't know how you feel about requests, but please have at least one person in CUSS wear a snuggie with kevlar coating and bunny ears.

            And yes, supers CAN wear their underwear on the outside if they want, but who in their right mind would? Seriously, if you suddenly developed super powers and, for Dawkins knows what reason, decided to use them for crime...would YOU put on a brightly colored spandex costume? I doubt it very much. 

            > but please have at least one person in CUSS wear a snuggie with kevlar coating and bunny ears.

            That is too hilarious not to do. It might just be a mention or a cameo, but I will make that happen.

                  Role scripts.

                  People could take their special supernatural talents and map them into any reference frameâ€”being a super-gambler, for instance, or a super-doctor, or even a super-inventor. Those sort of people don't wear costumes, but they also don't get in fights, or think of themselves as "super." They just have a savant-like ability to do something, and work that into their lives.

                  Some people, though, take a supernatural talent and map it into the reference frame of comic book narratives. They wear the spandex for the same reason they fight (or cause) the crime: because that's What You Do When You're In A Comic Book. Not because it's a *good* idea, but because it's a *cached thought*. What uniform do you wear if you fight crime with superpowers? "Uhh... spandex!"

                  (Though this would suggest that the more epistemically-rational a character is, the less likely they are to decide to wear spandex on their own, because they know to look past the cached thought. Were there any particularly *epistemically* rational characters in Worm? Like, the Luminosity!Bella kind of epistemically-rational. I don't remember any.)

                    I would really like to believe that everyone who thinks this:

                    1. Goes to the trouble to make the costume
                    1. Puts it on and looks in a mirror
                    1. Thinks "huh.  I'm not 8 heads tall and built like an anatomy model (male) or supermodel with HH breast implants (female).  I actually have body fat, and therefore do not meet the comic book standards for spandex."
                    1. Throw the spandex in the trash, buy some tactical gear and go to town.

          ```
          (It suddenly occurs to me that maybe when you say failing, you mean that it fails to be a rationalfic. In that case, please ignore this)

          Can you really call it a failing if it allows the story to grow in new interesting ways? Wildbow told a story that hadn't been told before, and if you 'fixed' all those issues (without growing the story in new and nontrivial ways), what you'd have left is something way less interesting.

          Can you really call it a failing if a repair job doesn't make it better?

          It's not power creep, it's a dramatic increase in scope. Fighting gods isn't boring, it's awesome. It's not a narrative cheat, it's a setting.  
          Horror story monsters are EvilForTheLulz, too. Does that mean horror stories are bad? No, it just means the story isn't about the villain.

          As for Taylor's power, she really should have been a thinker 12 or something. She had a massively parallel brain - the real secret of the story is that she was overpowered all along, it just took her a while to figure it out.

            > Fighting gods isn't boring, it's awesome.

            Not wanting to get too tangled up in this, I'll just respond to this one item.

            Fighting gods is boring, because there's only two stories that you can tell.  The first goes like this:

            1. God/heroes come to battle.
            1. God holds the idiot ball and decides to toy with his opponents.
            1. Heroes lose, lose, lose, lose, lose, lose, lose, WIN!  Yay, heroes!

            The second story you can tell goes like this:

            1. God/heroes come to battle.
            1. God wins.
            ```

            - u/MadScientist14159:
              ```
              In this case it should be noted that god wasn't holding the idiot ball.

              He was an idiot the whole time, so being an idiot was entirely in character for him.
              ```

              - u/eaglejarl:
                ```
                Fair enough.  I don't think that invalidates my point though -- there's two scenarios: either god (is an idiot / holds the idiot ball) so that the heroes have a chance, or he isn't / doesn't and the heroes lose more or less instantly.

                Rationalfic or not, characters shouldn't be pointlessly stupid -- whether you call that 'their character' or 'carrying the idiot ball', it's still bad writing.[1]  If the only way you can have a fight *not* be a curbstomp is for one character to carry the idiot ball, then you need to find a way to write your story so that battle doesn't have to happen.

                [1] The only time that I think you *can* have a character be an idiot is if they're only there for comic relief.  Even then, you really want to go lightly on that note.

                  I would also point out

                  **WORM SPOILERS**

                  that they *didn't* beat god. Taylor bullied him into commiting suicide.

                    Hm.  You know, I actually don't remember how it ended -- by that point I was really just reading out of stubbornness.  

                    What I remember is that Taylor took a power boost that she was explicitly told would probably do horrible things to her and, oh shocker, it did horrible things to her, including making her mute.  She then got with Doormaker, grabbed control of every cape in existence and...did something.  The next thing I remember was her getting shot-but-not-really and then ending up in Dimension X talking to her mirror universe mom.

                    What actually happened in between?

                      ```
                      **EVEN MORE WORM SPOILERS**

                      Taylor lost control over most people because Doormaker used up all the batteries on his power.

                      Taylor remembered that Zion had predicted everything using his version of the path to victory shard, but realised that Zion is stupid enough to be wrong about what he was seeing.

                      Zion was enacting the path to bringing back his partner the entire time. So Taylor threw Oliver at him. Oliver's power is to become the perfect image of beauty to whoever looks at him, so when Zion looked at him he turned into Zion's partner.

                      Zion realised he hadn't *actually* managed to bring back his partner with his precog powers, only to find someone who *looked like* her, and that the cycle was well and truly over with nothing he could do about it, and in his despair he destroyed himself.

            Yeah, couldn't figure out how to make that work and I'm on my phone so it's irritating to experiment.   (EDIT:  Back on my laptop now, still couldn't make it work by having something before the linebreak.  I'm not sure Reddit can actually do multi-line spoilers.)


            As to when I'll start: I'm planning to wrap up Squiring the Phoenix soon--hopefully next chapter--and will be starting Currently Unnamed Superhero Story after that. 

            Note for those who missed it: chapters in CUSS...hm, that's actually an unfortunate acronym; hadn't realized when I wrote it. Ah well, it's amusing.

            Anyway, chapters in CUSS will be given out for free via download link to people on my mailing list. A few days later the link will stop working and the chapter will only be available for purchase on Amazon. I would like to leave it permanently available to list members, but Amazon's TOS does not allow that.

      Okay no flying for Team Anko, how about digging, I'm sure Anko herself has some super duper earth digging techniques, and could be supercharged to dig on a much faster scale. 

      In fact that's what the railroad should be, a deep long line between Land of Tech (forgot name) and Land of Fire, heck teach Naruto building skills and you can economically pressure people to move in to your land via cheap buidlings.

      Ok good to hear on the super story thing, will join the Google group.

  Oh gods, Orochimaru is hilarious in this fic. He's just so friendly to them, despite essentially holding them hostage. Affably Evil villains are the best :D

  As far as other comments go, I see yet another change from canon regarding how the Nine-Tailed Fox has been dealt with. Seems the 4th used the Reaper to grab the fox from across the village, instead of teleporting it elsewhere first as in canon. No mention of Tobi, but it could just be that wouldn't be known from observation.

  Interesting. Orochimaru is doing some very odd things. I don't know what level he's playing at, but I suspect his answer would be "one level higher than you."

  Very nice of him to correct some of Naruto's taijutsu, regardless of purpose. Not sure about the earth jutsu. Was Hinata's affinity earth?

  It seems that Orochimaru likes being a teacher. c: Too bad about the whole evil scientist thing.
