  The character's mind may have deteriorated so much by this point it's difficult to keep the RT tag on it, but I've been posting these arcs from the beginning and I'll keep it up till the very end, which is quite soon.

    Being able to reason on corrupted hardware is the quintessential RT skill, and Sy did it pretty well, considering.

    [At the end of last arc](#s ", The Lambs found Sy sitting very still in an uncomfortable position, not even going to the bathroom, because he realized his mind was not trustworthy and wanted to minimize the damage he could do.")

  How much longer till I can start reading this thing without the hell of waiting?
  ```

    Hah! Soon. He says it's the last arc.
    ```

      ```
      So much pain, been waiting so long
      ```

        Hah! There are some somewhat natural stopping points, and depending on your reading speed / ability to not-binge, it might be done by the time you catch up. There are A LOT of words in Twig.

        Edit:

        As of two months ago, 1.3 million words, with an extrapolated complete length of 1.5. Worm was 1.6?

  Is Twig actually rational fic? I didn't get the feeling that Worm was particularly rational fic...
  ```

  - u/narfanator:
    ```
    I'd say so. Characters are actively thinking and creative with their situations and the world, and every character (even the minor and temporary ones) have their own unique histories (however brief) and happenstances.

    But, I also felt that way about Worm, more or less. Characters weren't *as* rational - many of them acted like normal people, rather than rational people.

    Still, I'd say Twig is more rational than Worm, if only because the main character is specifically "devastatingly intelligent".

    ```
    It's "sidebar rational", which is a low bar to clear.
    ```

  - u/AmeteurOpinions:
    ```
    It's not an incredible standout of the genre, but it checks off the sidebar at the very least.
    ```
