## [Challenge Companion] Long View

### Post:

**tl;dr: this is the companion thread to [the biweekly challenge](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8gx1th/biweekly_challenge_long_view/), post ideas, comments, or recommendations here.**

I think the long view in fiction faces a few fundamental narrative problems, the most significant of which is that the long view by its nature is usually not about immediate points of tension. If you're doing what you can to make a big impact ten generations in the future, either that impact is probably visible to the current generation, or there's little immediate visible consequence (or assurance that you've actually done it). That's not to say that depicting the long view is a lost cause, just that it faces some hurdles in terms of how a story is structured and what conflicts work well within it.

Do you have any recommendations? Any notable works where the impact of a character's actions will be felt most keenly long after he's lived his life?
