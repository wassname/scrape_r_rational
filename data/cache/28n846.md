  This is probably my favorite Naruto FF. The writing is good, the characters are interesting, there is a novel plot. Nothing is worse than fanfiction that follows cannon exactly except for one stupid extra character thrown in.

  I particularly like how it expands on concepts already present in canon in an interesting way without going completely batshit crazy like many fics do. The protagonists become overpowered, but through somewhat justifiable means, and the antagonist does as well. The OC abilities are believable and thematically appropriate. Canon is altered slightly to make things more believable/interesting.

  The only thing I didn't like was that it spends more time focusing on sex than necessary (nothing too graphic), but at least a justification is provided (spending 30 years as a hormone driven teenager is going to mess with your head).

    Very much personal opinion, obviously.

    I prefer realistic human relationships to nearly asexual characters blushing at each other in a "T" rated fic for 200k words and three hundred years of relative personal experience. But again, personal preference.

    I also thought [Harry Potter and the Sword of Gryffindor](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2841153/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Sword-of-Gryffindor) was hilarious, so my tastes might be significantly different.

      I agree that the T rated crap is not as interesting, but I disagree that the relationships portrayed are particularly 'realistic' =)

      Granted, there are some significant differences from normal reality including the aforementioned permanent teen-hood, existence of sex-magic, pressures resulting from a near constant state of warfare plus the bizarre circumstances the characters find themselves in, and a semi-schizophrenic protagonist.

      I don't read a lot of material with smut, but I didn't find the content objectionable. It was just a little out of place with the rest of the novel.

  Far better than the fic that inspired it, [Chunin Exam Day](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3929411/1/Chunin-Exam-Day). Unlike that huge pile of mess, this one is relatively tightly plotted. Rules are consistent. Writing is good, with only a few proofreading misses in the entire fic. The author doesn't act (and write like) a spoiled child in ANs that are still there years later.

  tl;dr Good and sexy timeloop fun.

  Several people have commented on the sexual content. It is well under the "M" rating on FFN, and also logically follows from the characters' given histories and personality traits. It also involves women liking and seeking out sex, open and poly relationships, and same-sex relations. All things with which rational readers should have no problem at all. But this is an area some people have trouble with, a bias many have trouble overcoming because of their lifetime cultural influences.

  Sex is tastefully done here, if you like reading about adults with centuries of personal experience having complicated sexual relationships. Casual sex is had, and no one is Magically Married by Destiny. The closest it gets to that is rather an existential horror show that needs to be resolved before any meaningful relationships can actually happen.

  What it is clearly not, however, is some teen wet-dream fantasy. People have problems in their relationships in this story, including jealousy, and overcome them through logical events and personal development. As in real life, people are drawn together not by fate, but by experiencing events together. It is part of the plot, not merely tagged on.

  If it wasn't clear, this is one of my all-time favorite fanfics, representing some of the best the genre has to offer.

  [So choice. If you have the means, I highly recommended picking it up.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV2Y2kIUkIs)

  As a man unfamiliar with Naruto canon - this is amazing. I read it twice already and would read again. (For comparison, i read HPMOR 6 times)
  ```

  - u/Nepene:
    ```
    I too am unfamiliar with Naruto canon and found it amazing.

    I really like how, despite the timeloop, they keep it fresh. They even manage to regularly threaten the main character with consequences that could destroy them despite the time loop.
    ```

  - u/gabbalis:
    ```
    Yeah. I also read it twice. Its too short for me to read a third time for a while though, needs to drain from memory a bit.
    ```

  - u/RMcD94:
    ```
    I'll be a counterpoint and say that I started reading based on this and without any clue of who the characters are and what half the things being referenced it's pretty difficult to get into it.

    It's especially weird when it start gets into sex and the characters are 13 years old or something. I don't think there are many 13 year olds who suggest threesomes.
    ```

- u/Stop_Sign:
  ```
  I really enjoyed this one. Unlike some time loop stories, this one actually has valid conflict.
  ```

- u/Timewinders:
  ```
  Just a warning since this story doesn't come with trigger warnings. There is a lot of torture, brainwashing, and otherwise extremely unsavory stuff in here.
  ```

  - u/Nepene:
    ```
    Yeah. Since the main character's soul is the only thing that can be permanently influenced a lot of bad stuff happens.
    ```

- u/Kodix:

  Read most of this one, will probably finish it soon. 

  My feelings on it are not as positive as others here. My main problems are:

  - The writing style. It sometimes feels.. sloppy. A bit anachronistic, a bit immature (in the sense that the writer isn't experienced).

  - The grammar mistakes/typos. They're unavoidable to some extent, but there's a lot more of them here than in more professional stories linked on this sub.

  - The sheer amount of sexual adventuring. It reads like someone's daydreams written down, at times. This is justified to an extent, and would work in terms of story if it was toned down a bit and better written, but as it is, it's annoying.


  All that said, I agree with all the positive points others have made. It's a decent read if you can get past the issues (which I did), but I wouldn't consider it as good as most of the stuff posted here.

  As an example of a fic that I enjoyed a bit more, [Black Cloaks, Red Clouds](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8654967/1/Black-Cloaks-Red-Clouds). Far from perfect, but doesn't have the issues mentioned above.
  ```

  - u/tactical_retreat:
    ```
    I read Black Cloaks, Red Clouds based on your recommendation, it was pretty good. 

    Its remarkable that such a good fic can have so few reviews/favs/follows, compared to some of the crap that you find just by sorting on favorites and limiting to > 100K

  I've really been loving time loop things lately. I've read Innortal's time loops in the universes I cared about, I REALLY wish there was a lot more Mother of Learning, I also liked [Dimension Hopping for Beginners](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2829366/1/Dimension-Hopping-for-Beginners) which is along those lines. Anyone have any suggestions for other stories along the same lines?
  ```

  - u/ancientcampus:
    ```
    I agree - my favorite part is that it's 1) a time loop, 2) which actually has a tense and driving plot, with time-sensitive crises. Ans lastly, 3) it introduces new and interesting "magic system" / universe-building elements.

    If anyone has good time-loop recommendations, I'd love to hear 'em.

    Here's a good MLP time-loop, which I enjoyed despite having only watched 4 episodes of the show.
    http://www.fimfiction.net/story/67362/hard-reset
    It only really provides #1 of my criteria above, but it's quite regardless, and its sequels provide #2 and #3. In the story, Twilight's characterization would greatly appeal to HPMOR/LW fans, and I had the impression that the author was already part of the community.

    Nartuo: Ramen Days is short, fun, and unfinished. My opinion: the story stops before it would get boring. Also in the Videogame-saves=time-loops genre.

  ```
  I really enjoyed that, and read it over the course of two days. I think I probably would have gotten a bit more out of it if I had ever watched Naruto. I somewhat agree on the issue of sexual content, but while I think it's a flaw, it's not a flaw that particularly bothers me.
