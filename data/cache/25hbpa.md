  I know it's short, but it's stuck in my mind.

  Genre savvy characters are awesome, but so often they're still limited by narrative causality. This is a beautiful example of a genre savvy character utterly breaking the story, and the result is, she made a different story.

    that goes beyond genre savvy, it's medium savvy.

      She can see ghosts?
      ```

    This is highly amusing.

    I'd love to see more of this.

  Well, an extended take on that theme would be [Unsung, Story of the Inconspicuous](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5514187/1/Unsung-Story-of-the-Inconspicuous).

    Well, this looks interesting. 4.5 years old, and it's still getting regular updates. If it's as much of a Rationality-esque decon fic as it looks from the start of the story, it deserves its own submission. And a place on the TVtropes fanfic recs page, if not its own entry.

  Sorry, but *pole. Unless she's jumping on surveys.

  I would watch the hell out of this.

    Agreed. It would make a great spiritual sequel to TMOS Haruhi, with a dash of Lucky Star and Excel Saga.

    I'd think it would work best if, instead of simply noping the premise of each anime genre, she went along with the premise for a bit before deconstructing it until the narrativium collapses.

  I absolutely love it and am sad it's not a real manga I can go read.
