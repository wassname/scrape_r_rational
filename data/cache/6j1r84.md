## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  Where does the "furry" art style come from?

  I really like anthropomorphic animals, and my current campaign in D&D features them heavily. The problem is that I want pictures for them, but searching "anthropomorphic wolf" brings up a lot of furry stuff, and it's all an art style that I find extremely aesthetically unpleasing (like a cartoon wolf you might see selling children's cereal, I guess). This probably relates to some subcultural norms that I'm ignorant of, but I find it quite annoying.

    A while back, I worked on some werewolf mods for a couple of games where the point was to make the werewolves look more like natural animals rather than your typical slavering monsters. Unfortunately, finding good, non-creepy reference images was a challenge.  I did come across a few artists on DeviantArt who might have what you're looking for:

    http://nimrais.deviantart.com/gallery/

    http://darknatasha.deviantart.com/gallery/

    http://lhuneart.deviantart.com/gallery/

    All three have also linked to works by artists with similar styles in their favorites section.


    edit: Browsing a bit on DeviantArt yielded some similar artists who might be worth looking at:

    >Where does the "furry" art style come from?

    Personally, I'd think this would come from a combination of anime/the neonatal instinct and body image/self-identity issues. \*

    If you look at any piece of furry art, they tend to have

    * large heads
    * large eyes (in proportion to their heads)

    These are characteristics humans are ingrained to find "cute." You see them pretty much everywhere in media not deliberately designed to look realistic. Cereal boxes particularly exaggerate this, as they're aimed towards children for whom cute things must be *really* cute, but even looking at American programming like *Archer* or a Seth McFarlane cartoon you can see elements of this.

    Combined with the fact that furries are a very visual subculture, and that much of furry art is derivative from sources like Sonic, pokemon, catgirls in anime, whatever, that explains why those traits are so exaggerated.

    For a literary comparison, look at the people on royalroadl-- because they're so influenced by translated Chinese xianxia and light novels, many adopt the same style of writing, even if their work isn't, strictly speaking, a fanfic.

    Similarly, garish colors are probably inspired by the crazy, colorful hairstyles of anime characters.

    But I mentioned another cause, too-- body image/self-identity issues. You probably know that furries are a rather isolated subculture. From other comments in this thread, people get *really* up in arms about them. But as a result of human psychology, group persecution makes it easier to take up a more "us versus them" psychology. As a result, furries are predisposed to be accommodating of members that are also from other minority groups, such as (most notoriously) gay men.

    So you have a whole bunch of people who aren't quite comfortable with themselves and with their place in society. And, in keeping with the traditions of the internet, they craft themselves avatars distanced from their mundane real-life selves. Deliberately unrealistic, because a realistic avatar would defeat the point of having an avatar.

    And then, even if these people account for only a fraction of the furry population, you hit a self-reinforcing affect with regards to the art: the unrealistic stuff is popular anyways, so versus the extra effort of makin realistic art, artists make unrealistic stuff. Which makes the unrealistic stuff more popular, and so on and so on.

    Of course, I may be overthinking this stuff-- maybe furry art is just unrealistic because people feel guilty about fapping to animals.

    \* Disclaimer: I'm not actually involved with the furry community, although I've read furry works when they intersect with my other speculative fiction related interests. (ex. the stuff DataPacRat writes.)

    Do you have examples of the kind of art you do like, and the kind you dislike? Is [this](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/76/81/ea/7681eab092b60f6a3336208f8bbbc95f.jpg) what you call the furry style? I can't really imagine this kind of art style on children's cereal, but maybe US cereal have different marketing strategies :P

    ([very cartoonish](https://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/casey-milne-the-wolf/images/3/30/Female_wolf_or_fox_base_png_by_bluesliver_star-d4czzpn.png/revision/latest?cb=20130305171133) style sounds closer to what you describe, but I don't really see much of that when searching for 'anthropomorphic wolf')

    I think a large part of the reason furry porn is popular is that it safely keeps to the far side of the uncanny valley. Drawing things that clearly aren't meant to be people means we don't pick up on the bad proportions etc, and ingest in a more abstract way - which helps stimulate/enables imagination in case of porn, and helps emphasise in case of plot.

      I would use such a term to describe it, yes.

      > I can't really imagine this kind of art style on children's cereal

      It's less-brightly-colored, but I'd say it still falls into the same general category of mediocrity as cereal-mascot art, [*GURPS* art](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/martialarts/img/cover_lg.jpg), and stereotypical DeviantArt art.
      ```

      - u/Anderkent:
        ```
        I guess I'm so ingrained into this that I can't really think of a different way of picturing anthropomorphised animals! Examples are welcome :P
        ```

        - u/ToaKraka:
          ```
          Actually, let me backpedal...

          In my opinion, the vast majority of "anthro" art falls into the uncanny valley. (Compare illustrations for, e.g., [*Redwall*](https://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/redwall/images/6/6c/Redwallfeast.jpg) and [*Mistmantle*](https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1439673381l/119146.jpg), which are the only non-uncanny examples of such art that I can think of, but are significantly less anthropomorphic than the norm for the category.) Most anthro art also *happens* to be drawn by mediocre artists, who share the stereotypical cereal-mascot/*GURPS*/DeviantArt style.
          ```

          - u/alexanderwales:
            ```
            I guess "less anthro" is probably the thing that I'm looking for, since *The Wind in the Willows* and *Mouseguard* fit in the same vein of humanistic animals that I find aesthetically pleasing. Thanks for the examples.
            ```

  - u/ToaKraka:
    ```
    Realistic anthro art does exist; I saw some on DeviantArt, years ago. Unfortunately, however, I cannot produce a link.

    IIRC (though I may be misremembering), the high-quality pieces that I saw were labeled, not by the *species* of the character, but by the *name* of the character.

    This offers more insight:

    http://www.cartoonbrew.com/ideas-commentary/why-is-it-so-difficult-to-make-cute-characters-81160.html


    Excerpted:

    >So what makes a cartoon character cute? You could reduce the answer down to a few basic characteristics: big eyes and head, fluffiness, warmth and chubbiness. “Cuteness is based on the basic proportions of a baby plus the expressions of shyness or coyness,” wrote Preston Blair in Advanced Animation . According to Blair, other cute traits include:


    >
    * Head large in relation to the body.

    * Eyes spaced low on the head and usually wide and far apart.


    * Fat legs, short and tapering down into small feet for type.

    * Tummy bulges—looks well fed.




    >But cuteness is far more complex than even Blair’s set of rules; some consider E.T., Yoda and WALL·E to be the epitome of cute, despite their furless, odd appearances. Cuteness and a character’s perceived hugability aren’t always determined by aesthetic appeal. “Cuteness is distinct from beauty,” wrote Natalie Angier for
    The New York Times . “Beauty attracts admiration and demands a pedestal; cuteness attracts affection and demands a lap.”


    >But with any extreme comes another. If a character is too cute and sugary sweet, the audience can develop skepticism. “Cute cuts through all layers of meaning and says, ‘Let’s not worry about complexities, just love me,'” philosopher Denis Dutton told The New York Times . It is for that very reason cuteness stirs uneasiness and sometimes feels cheap.


    >After all, the adorable, smiling face of a child can hide the havoc he just wreaked by breaking all of his toys. “Cuteness thus coexists in a dynamic relationship with the perverse,” writes Daniel Harris in his book Cute, Quaint, Hungry And Romantic: The Aesthetics Of Consumerism . You could call this the Gremlin Effect—a character with an underlying creepiness. Troll dolls (which were recently acquired by DreamWorks Animation) and Cabbage Patch Kids are the inexplicable result of this paradox.

  Pretty decent progress this past week.  I’m in the middle of writing XGEF, which, contrary to some people’s expectations, is not going to be all that big. It basically handles setting up a very bare-bones framework around which an engine can be built, while also providing a few systems related to managing mods. In particular, it will handle the system that takes a set of mods, compares it to the code that it’s modifying, and then performs any alterations that need to happen before compiling them.

  I had thought that this last bit was going to take loads of work, but as it turns out Microsoft has actually done a good job with a library called Roslyn.  Roslyn is the compilation engine that Visual Studio itself uses to compile C# code (as well as Visual Basic, but who’s counting).  Since it itself was written using C# and then subsequently open-sourced, it means that those of us looking to compile C# code on the fly have an extremely powerful tool at our fingertips.

  It’s not just compiling, but it also handles code analysis, which for us is really the important part.  I need to be able to look at the actual symbols that the code represents, and not just the text of the code itself. For instance, here is a symbol graph that Roslyn generated based on the entry point of my test program:

  http://i.imgur.com/GadZbhR.png


  The blue nodes are *symbols*, which is to say, the *actual* constructs that I’m worried about manipulating.  The green nodes are the actual code that was typed (read them all left to right to see what the program that was analyzed was), and the grey and white are things like whitespace and other chaff that, while important for actually reading the code, does not affect its meaning.


  This system is *powerful*.  Manipulating only nodes, I could, for instance, load up a mod in Roslyn, search for a blue class node, grab its name, look for that same class name node in the core game symbols, and then just copy-paste. Boom, moddability. 

  (Granted there’s more to it to make the system intuitive, but I was *not* expecting to have this level of progress after like a week’s worth of work.)


  ----


  While discussing this progress on the Discord server, we had a bit of discussion over the minimalistic bare minimum version of a standard Pokemon game.  What I mean by this is, what is the absolute least number of mechanics that one could include to have a simple game still contain the core gameplay loop of Pokemon?

  I can’t remember where I first came across this concept (probably Extra Credits), but I remember the example they gave of the original Super Mario.  You pull Mario down to the barest of bones and what do you have left that’s still fundamentally Mario gameplay?  A block that can move right, jump, and a pit in the ground to jump over.  That’s pretty much it--all the rest (lives, score, time limit, goombas, mushrooms) is simply building off of that corest of mechanics.  


  The conclusion I came to for “what’s the most theoretically minimalistic version of Pokemon” was basically a never-ending string of battles, my argument being that the overworld is really just an excuse to get you from one battle to another.  Pokeballs, however, are still included in this pared-down version, as the game is essentially not just about fighting, but about building a team that fights.  It almost looks like an even more sparse version of Safari Zone: Your options are Fight or Capture, and the game is over when all your current team have been Fight’d to death.


  Why bring this up?  Well, we’ve been trying to hash out where the line needs to be drawn between hidden, compiled, inaccessible game system logic, and exposed, open, freely end-user-changeable moddable files.  This exercise was an effort to try and define that line, but I don’t think it works: Combat and Team-building are certainly core, but neither one is a single all-encompassing system to have a fence built around it, and there are other concepts that are just as crucial that ought not to be meddled with.

  In the end, I’m betting that most systems will be more-or-less hybrid: some bits that can’t change to ensure the stability of the game as a whole, and then some parameters or configurations that are freely moddable (you can’t remove or change the fundamental concept of a Stat, but you can change ATK or DEF or add a new MAGIC stat if you so choose).  However, it will be important to ensure that everything that should be in the walled garden, is.  For every system that we permit to be potentially modified, it increases the complexity of the system as a whole, and introduces what is essentially a random element to the game’s structure.  

  So with that, I leave you with a question:  what is *essential* about Pokemon to you?  What parts could you absolutely not part with if you still wanted to call something a Pokemon game?  On the flip side, what concepts could you absolutely do without?  Any input would greatly help our efforts to map out this territory.

    I have apparently gotten a very different experience out of pokemon than you have. I play it, primarily not for the battles but for the experience of exploring the world, experiencing the detailed storyline, and seeing the npcs. I just played through the battles to get them over with. Once I unlock repel in a game, I use it constantly. You could get rid of the battles and I'd have just about as much fun. So honestly if you were to get rid of the overworld, you would have gotten rid of the enjoyable part for me.

    Maybe that's why Pokemon is so popular, it appeals to different people for different reasons - the collecting, the battling, and the exploring.
    ```

    - u/ketura:
      ```
      Yeah, I was mostly attempting to identify the *mechanical* reasons that one might be attracted to the game--after all, I'm trying to identify what systems ought to exist at a core, unchangeable level. Story and setting are things that were probably the primary reason that the games were so successful, but it's not something that I can enshrine beyond ensuring that dialog, visuals, and NPC interaction are things the game has, which isn't very helpful as a focus. 

      I can certainly respect the multi-group attractiveness of the formula, it brings to mind the four player archetypes. Rest assured I'm not attempting to change the design at this point, simply trying to organize it. 

      This entire line of thinking has certainly shed light on the broad appeal of the games, but has been nearly worthless for its original intended purpose. Oh well. You can't force eureka moments, I suppose.

  - u/rhaps0dy4:

    Can a _game_ be irrational? Surely the story parts of the game can, but the playable mechanics? You have a set of rules that define the universe, they are encoded in the game's program.

    Ah wait, single-player games are always rational (story notwithstanding). But games where you interact with other characters, if those characters don't have a set of goals, could also be considered irrational. Even though those characters have _rules_ and act according to then, they should then be considered part of the environment, rather than agents. In any case the presence of NPCs can make a game irrational if you care that they have no goals.

    EDIT: nevermind, you've thought about this. It's in the linked google doc:

    >So, to recap: a rational game does not force the player to perform any actions that violate the agreed role of the player (or player-character), whether that be because all actions within the entire world have been constrained to fit a particular mould or because the role has been broadened enough that all actions possible within the game are reasonably within the bounds of the player role contract.

  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Do cardio, the closer to running the better.  This partly increases base metabolic rate, partly expends calories directly, and *mostly* represses your appetite.  You'll be *really* hungry afterwards the first few times, though, as your body realizes it has to build up the resources to do *that* again.  Weightlifting can help raise base metabolic rate, but it mostly just makes you look good and have an easy time doing physical labor.

    Learn to cook healthier.  This isn't nearly as hard or as ascetic as you think it is; you just might not have been *taught*.  For instance, putting lemon juice and the right herbs on things is *just better*: it turns dull steamed vegetables or chopped salads into delightful but extremely healthy meals.  Favor baking, roasting, steaming, and grilling as preparation methods; avoid sauces.  Favor fish, vegetables, and complex carbs like legumes or whole grains over simple carbs.  When wanting something sweet, the right fresh fruit can really hit the spot -- but you have to know how to get *tasty* fresh fruit, which can be hard in some places.

    Don't ever get ascetic or make a healthy lifestyle into a punishment.  In a related matter, when the health effects of exercise start to make a real difference, you are going to get horny as all hell (compared to a sedentary lifestyle).  Pleasantly, you're also going to have greater sexual endurance.  Incentives!

    I lost weight without any kind of special diet or exercise routine, so just going to list what worked for me in case it helps you too:

    1) Reduce food portions and eat slower. Give yourself more time to feel "satisfied" by a meal, and practice stopping there rather than eating until you're full, or eating past that point before you realize it because your stomach hasn't finished sending you the fullness signals yet. Practice cutting extraneous things first. If you get fast food, don't get fries or a soda. If you eat at a restaurant, don't get an appetizer.

    2) Drink water. Cut out all soda *including diet soda*, but also any fruit juice, which is just liquid sugar. *Water.* Tea and coffee are okay, as long as you don't add sugar or cream. Vegetable juices can be, though pay attention to their sugar content.  Similarly, use more seasonings, less sauces.  Salad dressing should be oil and vinegar based, not creamy. Lots of things can be made tasty with lemon juice and/or salt.

    3) Exercise is *healthy* but it is not necessary to lose weight. It can even be detrimental if it makes it harder for you to limit your food intake. Start by limiting your food intake: if you feel like you're handling it okay, try exercising. If you start snacking more after you do, you're undoing the calorie loss of the exercising. This could still be okay if you're replacing fat with muscle, but it is a slow process and will not be encouraging on the weight scale.

    4) *Use social pressure systems.* Tweet or post your weight every week, if you have twitter or facebook. Yes, it's embarrassing. Still worth it. It's amazing how powerful a motivator it is to get support from friends and family, as well as have that extra voice of embarrassment speak up when you feel the urge to grab a cookie or soda once in awhile but you don't want to end up with a higher weight when you post that week. Shame is a shitty thing to feel, but if you're going to feel it anyway, weaponize it to your advantage.

    5) Most of all, don't get discouraged if you backslide a little every so often. You are going to be undergoing a process, and should not expect yourself to master it immediately. You will fail once in awhile. You will learn from these mistakes. You will get better at recognizing the right balance of food to keep away hunger pains without ever eating beyond the point of fullness.

    Good luck!

    - Don't drink your calories. If you want to get drunk, strongly prefer hard liquor, neat, to beer.
    - I'm OK with strenuous cardio, but I'd worry about high-impact things on your knees and lower-body joints while you're fat. I don't know how fat you are now. You may want to walk at a fast pace (3 MPH) and crank up the incline to something high (10% or higher).
    - I like lifting weights, too. I'd do that on the days you're not doing cardio work.
    - I like swimming because it's cardio, but not lower-body.
    - I prefer something in the vicinity of paleo/keto; /r/paleo and /r/keto can help.
    - Frozen vegetables are the best thing since sliced bread in the universe of semi-convenience foods sold at supermarkets. Nuke in the microwave, put salt, pepper, and butter on top, and you're done prepping a respectable side of broccoli.
    - sure, there are lots of fancypants paleo recipes, but my go-to is ground beef cooked in a pan with some random herbs and spices and maybe some cheese sprinkled on top.
    - [Mark's Daily Apple](http://www.marksdailyapple.com/blog/) is neat.
    - I find it's a lot easier to not get cravings for sweets and carbs when I'm not eating carbs; that's why I tend to stay away from carbs.
    - Fake sugar sometimes triggers sugar-and-carbs cravings; you may or may not be vulnerable to this.

      They sell fresh broccoli in little steamer bags.  Poke hole with fork, microwave, you have broccoli.

    You might be interested in the hacker's diet: https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/

    In general, I would ignore exercise as a contributing factor and focus entirely on diet. I commute to work by bicycle (1 hour total) and that burns a paltry ~300 calories a day (I'm slow!): that's about the calories in a large coke. I don't know about you, but it would be easier for me not to drink a coke than it would to cycle for an hour.

    With regards to exercise, I'm told that if you're not panting, you're unlikely to be losing weight from a given exercise. (Exactly at which point you start panting depends on your current fitness level and so forth). You don't want to be so intense that you injure yourself, but you do want it to be at least that difficult.

    Also, keep hydrated. Water's easily taken in and just as easily lost - drink as much water as you want. (Dehydration can be nasty).

    Thirdly, other people have already talked about diet. Diet is *very* important, and what's mostly important there is portion size. Try cutting back a little on that. Once you're used to the cut-back portions (and your body realises it's not actually starving on the reduced intake), then the cut-back portions will become the new normal. Then cut back just a little again. Rinse and repeat.

    ...I hope that's helpful.

      >I know to lose weight, you're trying to maximise "calories out - calories in".

      This is the quintessence of bad information around there. Calories out > calories in is a *consequence* of successfully doing things that lose weight, not a strategy to lose weight.

      See also [Scott](http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/01/12/the-physics-diet/)

      As to how to lose weight - yes, definitely try exercise, yes, definitely try different diets and see if they help. Start cooking for yourself, more as a friction mechanism preventing eating too much, rather than because eating out is particularly unhealthy (unless you fastfood. quit fastfood. also quit sugary things like soda / candy, if you consume regularly).

      In the end you just have to try things, and hope they work. A dietitian will probably help, in that they should at least prevent you from starving yourself by accident.

      But if nothing works for 6-12 months, at some point you might have to reevaluate whether it's worth the effort. If you're not mordibly obese, being a bit fat is not really that bad.

        Well yes and no. If a person were to have infinite willpower, then they could eat just enough calories/macronutrients/vitamins/etc. that it's healthy, but still being less than the amount of calories that they burn in a day, then they would wind up losing weight. Of course, people don't have infinite willpower.
        ```

        - u/blazinghand:
          ```
          There are things you can do to increase your willpower or to make things take less willpower. For example, instead of stopping eating candy and constantly focusing on not grabbing that chocolate bar, you could just remove candy from your house and fill it with healthy food. Now, you can still eat candy if you go get some, but it's easier to eat healthy food and the candy isn't literally right next to you tempting you constantly. Avoiding candy consumption in such a situation now is easier. So there are things you can do, willpower wise!

  A few months ago, a Star Wars fanfiction was posted here about Sio Bibble, who regretted having to play along with Palpatine. The latter had some leverage over him. Now, I've been trying to search for this story in the sub, but I've completely failed.

  Did I hallucinate this or does someone else remember this story? Also, do you have the link?

  I like guided meditation tapes.  There's a sub genre of guided meditation that uses visualizations like "walk through a garden" or "beach at sunset."

  I've found that these can be neat.  The visualization exercises end up feeling like something between a 'memory palace' and a lucid dream.

  Unfortunately, most of the image-based guided meditation tapes seem to be built around some specific goal like improving public speaking, or dieting, or whatever.

  I'd like to find something that just had the imagery, without any kind of purpose beyond enjoying a cool lucid dream.

  Have other people tried guided meditation?  Any recommendations for good readers?

  And does anyone know of a series that does the visualizations without attaching any specific self improvement goal?

    I'm actually suprised by this. I'd assumed most would focus on religion. My parents made me go to a sunday class that was provided by the local catholic church while I was in high school. This type of exercise was fairly common.

    I never did take the exercises seriously though. At the time I already considered myself an apatheist.

  Which coins do you consider to be the most pleasing in form? (Note that I'm talking *primarily* about the overall size, shape, weight, and color of a coin, rather than about the designs pressed into each of its faces.)

  As a USAian who has only minimal experience with the coins of other countries, I'd hazard a guess that the plain quarter is my favorite. I'd rate the Sacagawea/presidential dollar coin a little lower&mdash;perhaps because I feel offended at the pretension of a mere layer of brass to make the coin look like a gold piece from a fantasy story. I vaguely remember also liking the Anthony dollar coin (basically, a quarter with an undecagon on each face), but it isn't around nowadays.

  The approximately-1-inch size of the coins enumerated above definitely is the size that I like the most. I consider the 1.2-inch half-dollar coin (of which I happen to have controlled a single example for many years) somewhat fantastic (not `cool`, but `unrealistic`) in its largeness, while the 0.7-inch dime is right on the edge of being annoying in its smallness. The nickel seems just a hair too thick for its diameter (diameter ÷ thickness = 11, compared to 14 for the quarter and half-dollar and 13 for the dollar, dime, and penny). I can think of no objection to the penny, other than perhaps its tendency to gain a patina, which can be ugly.

    I think I like the 1 pound coins ([old](https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/nintchdbpict000280063085.jpg?strip=all&w=960), [new](http://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/1/590x/pound-749763.jpg)) probably the most pleasing to handle. However, they're heavy and big, so if you have more than 10 it gets unwieldy.

    OTOH why would you have more than 10 coins.

  So, munchkin this: you have a pocket computer. It's kinda like a supercomputer from the 1980s in terms of computation power, but *way* easier to use. Also, it magically sends information to other people's pocket computers. What could you do with said pocket computer to help you win at life? Which specific computations can you perform to lead you to better outcomes?

  What are you doing with your phones, basically? What would you *like* to be doing if there was an app for it? How has your pocket computer improved your life? 

  So far, I've found that having an infinite library in my hand helps with patience and waiting, and that a microphone/camera and data storage helps with memory. Using timers and the stopwatch helps with time sense and short-term memory, and having wikipedia/wolfram helps solve silly debates about known facts. If I ever start a company or otherwise complicate my finaces, it seems that spreadsheets are and always have been the killer app for personal computers in general, but with my current budget having instant access to my debit card amount is enough. 

  But none of these really feels revolutionary. I have a sense of *so much potential* that I'm not taking advantage of. It feels like everything so far has been *small* compared to what could be done. 

  In particular, I think there's potential to try and use it to automate doing-the-math and therefore make the results of actually calculating things out more available. 

  How are you using your pocket computer to be more rational?

    ...one app that I've noticed the lack of is a calculator that works with arbitrary number bases.

    It might be a bit silly - and I've never had *strong* reason to use one - but it's one of the few things that doesn't appear to be on any of the app stores. (Binary, yes; hex, yes; arbitrary base, no).

    Ok, reporting some ideas so far (1 day later, talked to ~4ish people on /r/rational briefly, probably 10-15 minutes of mental effort):

    Starting with a better definition of the problem: how can a cellphone become a better *mental prosthetic*? How can the always-with-you computer help as a mind-extension?

    1. It can generate random numbers. This is actually an upgrade, as people really struggle to be properly random. Helpful when you need your actions to be *unpredictable* more than anything else. Also works as a tiebreaker/timesaver/introspection tool for hard decisions. 

    2. You can get device-automation apps that let you hook up various tools and apps into custom solutions to whatever problem you're having. Worth investigating, but I'm not sure anything out there has a unix-command-line level of modularity and composability yet. 

    3. When people want to use a computer to mathematically model something, they reach for tools like MatLab/Gnu Octave. I should learn one of these and/or figure out if anyone's shrunk them into a pocket version. This is more about desktop than mobile, though. I doubt I'll have problems to apply it to that also need *quick* thinking. 

    4. I take notes with pictures, drawings, and text, but I should get a diagram editor as well for thinking about things that break down into clearly-defined parts. 

    5. Whenever doing day-to-day tasks I'm uncertain about, I can check against WikiHow. This seems like it could be an effective anti-akrasia weapon: fear of messing things up keeps me from doing so much basic, everyday stuff that it should be embarrassing. 

    6. More willingness to be a dirty winning cheater would lead to actions like looking up strategies for boardgames I play with friends. In fact, more willingness to check strategies against google in general would help. I could get a lot more out of that technique. Same goes for using photos of things as eidetic memory: I should use it more.

    I also asked in the [Saturday Munchkinry thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6j8m0r/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/djdbv6h/), please take a look at that as well.
