## Potential problems in the last few chapters of Worth the Candle. [SPOILERS]

### Post:

I found 2 problems, one of them a potential plot hole. \[SPOILERS\]

&#x200B;

* >!First: Juniper shouldn't have been able to get into sable fast enough to avoid the dragonfire when the dragon grabbed him. Sable has a 10 second absorption timer. It could be explained by his trait that can fudge rules, but no such thing was stated at the time or after.!<
* >!Second: He could have just put the dragon bodies into Sable and the only cost would have been 20 seconds. Unless there's an excuse for this to not be possible, Juniper should have done it thoughtlessly, but he didn't and no reasoning or explanations were given.!<

These might have already been brought up, but because I just caught up to it I've only noticed it now, if it has already been brought up please inform me and maybe don't downvote me too hard XD.

  Just to be clear, these are spoilers for the chapters that came out a few months ago. I panicked for a bit and went searching for new chapters I missed.

  ```
  Regarding your first comment: >!it has been stated and used several times that if Sable is being worn, then the 10 second count-down has already happened, so he can enter it instantly!<
  ```

  - u/lBlackFishl:
    ```
    And for the second >!There is a maximum volume to what can be stored in Sable as well, I think its described as about the size of a fridge.!<
    ```

      ```
      Really ? I've always thought of the solid steel chunks they keep inside sable for cover against void weapons as big things, bigger than fridges at least. Like 1m by 5 meters solid steel barricades, not fridges, fridges are like 80x190 a big one might be 120x220..
      ```

      - u/sicutumbo:
        ```
        Bigger than a fridge, but the >!unicorn!< couldn't fit in Sable whole.
        ```

        - u/fassina2:
          ```
          I don't remember that particular detail even with your reminder, but I'll take your word for it. I probably took the total volume being unlimited for storage, to mean there was no volume limit for storing an object.

          Thank you for clarifying =D

            Same with the helicopter.
            ```

  - u/fassina2:
    ```
    I must have missed that or forgotten it somehow. Thank you =D
    ```

    - u/sicutumbo:
      ```
      It's brought up multiple times indirectly. >!Bethel uses Sable's power to transport people around inside her, and through various effects she's always touching the people inside her. Whenever they request to be transported or whatever, she can immediately teleport them, because she had been touching them continuously for 10 seconds.!<
      ```

      - u/fassina2:
        ```
        Got it, so it's one of the things that can be done but because Juniper generally doesn't use sable we haven't seen it done often. Thank you =D
        ```

        - u/sicutumbo:
          ```
          It's just generally a not very useful thing to do when you're wearing the glove, which is why we don't see anyone else doing it. Using it like that here was very niche, and shows how much thought has been put into the combat capabilities of the glove.
          ```
