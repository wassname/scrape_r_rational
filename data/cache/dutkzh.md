## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  Hey everyone! I'm slowly going through the wiki recommendations, but I'm not very fond of some of them. 

  I'd like your recommendation on fics with good world building and character growth. The last fic I read like that is Worth the candle.
  Speaking of that, does anyone know when the next update is coming for it? (Fanfics are also welcome)

  Edit:
  I've already read and enjoyed Worm (waiting for ward to finish but putting off wildbow's other works for now) and mother of learning.

  I didn't like Methods of rationality( I enjoyed it in the beginning but it became tiresome later), and I've put a practical guide to evil on pause for now (it's not engaging for me)

    >good world building and character growth. 

    The fic on this reddit aren't very good on characterization.  What quality of Rational Fiction is attracting you?  
    *Jumper* by Steven Gould explores a Super Power intelligently.    
    *Street Cultivation* kinda deconstructs cultivation novels  
    *Orphans of Chaos* by John Wright  has good character development and a little muckinry.  Not technically rationalist.

      When I said character growth, I'm mainly referring to the protoganist learning from their mistakes becoming a better person.( It's present in both mother of learning and worth the candle but MoL seems to be a bit simple compared to WtC(same for world building as well))
      I like it when people face the consequence of their actions.
      Strong professional writing isn't necessary, but absolutely poor writing is hard to enjoy.

      I'll keep your recommendations saved as well, thank you.

        >I said character growth, I'm mainly referring to the protoganist learning from their mistakes becoming a better person

        That's surprisingly rare in series.  If you write a character growing and keep the series going, you then have to write a version of them that *has grown*, and most writers don't find that part interesting.   


        Genre Literature with growth...there is some pretty subtle growth in *The Murderbot Diaries*.  *One Woke Up* is about a former zombie relearning how to be human.   *The Salamanders* has plotting that would appear childish next to *Worth the Candle* but has surprisingly sophisticated world building and character development, and has one character that tries very hard to learn from his early mistakes.

         If you are capable of reading an LitRPG or fanfic at all you'll find *Orphans of Chao*s tame an innocent by comparison.

    The works that gets recommended here that I like the most are [Worm/Ward](https://parahumans.wordpress.com/) and [Mother of Learning](https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/1/Mother-of-Learning).

    Both have fantastic world building and great characters/growth, although I would give Worm/Ward the clear advantage on the character front, if only for the sheer variety of characters with their own distinct arcs.  

    I'd give more details on why I like them, but I'm not sure if you already tried them.  It might be a good idea to list a few of the works you didn't like and where they fell short for you.
    ```

    - u/dmantisk:
      ```
      I've read worm and now waiting for ward to finish. I've also caught up to mother of learning. Thanks though.
      ```

      - u/Retbull:
        ```
        Does ward get better or more interesting? I'm around the first major ending and I just don't give a crap about the MC. She seems too messed up to do anything except suffer from crippling anxiety.
        ```

        - u/RetardedWabbit:
          ```
          In my opinion it gets a lot better after the first 3 arcs or so. The MC is pretty messed up but her heroism and the larger fights later on are fantastic. Also the source of conflicts are pretty  interesting later.
          ```

        - u/absolute-black:
          ```
          I’m not sure if this explicitly addresses your complaint, but the MC certainly isn’t doing nothing in Ward currently.
          ```

        - u/steelong:
          ```
          It does get better.  At this point, I actually think Ward is better than Worm.  Her anxiety does mutate into something more like somewhat controlled *rage* over time.  Along with that, the other characters get interesting characterization and growth as more is revealed about them.

          Given how dark her inner monologue is, it can be easy to focus on how seemingly crippling her anxiety is.  Keep in mind, though, that the very first arc has her >!figure out a work-around to a fairly powerful stranger,  fight a weirdly powerful grab-bag cape, and voluntarily enter into fisticuffs with a giant centaur man. !< 

          I'd say that demonstrates pretty well that she can be pretty active even with the anxiety.
          ```

        - u/None:
          ```
          It does take quite a lot of words until Victoria feels more *anger* than anxiety, but when she does it's fucking fantastic. Having a Brute as a protagonist makes for some *amazingly* satisfying takedowns.

          This side of hers starts to shine through around Arc 5 or 6, >!at the Fallen battle where she drops a fucking boulder next to people to chase them out of cover, and eventually has her *throw* a villain so hard into a hill that for a while she's afraid she killed her.!<
          ```

  BIGPOST TIME

  Read lots of *Worm* stuff, not very much not!worm stuff, but I think it's all worth mentioning. STANDARD DISCLAIMER: none of this stuff is very rational, or if it is rational, it's on accident. It just met my bare minimum standards for being readable.

  **NOT WORM:**

  * [Wizarding Works](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/wizarding-works-a-harry-potter-si.57804/page-2) by Charlezany is a pretty bog-standard HP SI. I enjoyed it because it was refreshingly clear of bashing and stupid fanon. Don't get me wrong, there was still stupid fanon, but at least it was the *fun* stupid fanon. Also, there's this one commenter on the SV thread that talks entirely in incomprehensible Dark Lord Potter memes, which is really funny. Quote (commenter):

  > You should try and get life-debt slaves or something ,cause one always need minions or check to see if you can convince the house elves into getting every free elf to be your elf so you can have an army of obedient slaves cause how will you rule the world unless your mc has some other goal

  * [Son of Man\(nis\)](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/son-of-man-nis-an-asoiaf-si.57501/) by the same dude is a much more interesting story, all around. ASOIAF SI where the SI isn't the main POV character. He proceeds to rapidly modernize his little island nation. I like it because it actually engages with the characters of ASOIAF instead of just plowing over them or reducing them to useless props. Then again, if you're into /r/rational stuff, you might be annoyed at the lack of focus on the person who is ostensibly the main character and his industrial revolution.

  Both of these stories are pretty shaky and inconsistent, probably coming from a rapid upload schedule. There's a lot of really dumb stuff going on, even when the author is clearly capable of writing smart plots. But they're good popcorn reads, and have a few interesting ideas.

  **WORM:**

  A little less coverage per fic than I'd like, here, but I read *a lot*.

  * [I Didn't Make It \(OPM/Worm\)](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/i-didnt-make-it-opm-worm.782704/) is the best OPM crossover so far. Interesting look into Saitama's character, if brief. I'd wait on it to update more.

  * [A Cape in Konoha](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-cape-in-konoha-worm-naruto-au.778357/) is poorly written, filled with unnecessary Japanese, and basically neglects all of the interesting parts of Taylor's character. BUT, it's got a couple really cool fight scenes, and it's the only Naruto crossover that isn't dead. Take what you can get, I guess?

  * Wait, no, I was wrong. [Kaleidoscope](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/kaleidoscope.717019/) is a Sharingan!Taylor that also isn't dead. It's the edgiest Worm story I've ever had the pleasure of reading. Still, it's worth a laugh, and the edge is at least intentional.

  * [Steel Hands](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/steel-hands-worm-mcu.791926/) is Worm/MCU, Taylor fuses with Ultron after he dies. The combo ends up evening out most of Ultron's idiocy, making them quite an enjoyable character to read.

  * [Tinker Taylor Super Soaker](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/tinker-taylor-super-soaker-worm-altpower.784870/) leans heavily on the unreliable narrator trope. She's gotten an intelligence downgrade and her power basically makes it so that trauma *washes* off of her. Any more of the really good stuff would be spoilers. One of the better crack!fics.

  * [The End Bringer](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-end-bringer.298982/) was one of the stories resurrected for Halloween this year. Well-written but ultimately so saturated in Worm (2014) fanon that it's hard to read nowadays.

  * [Harmony](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/harmony-worm-avatar-tla-altpower.548936/) is more interesting because I think it's *quite bad*. Taylor is fiercely independent - even more so than she was in canon, and unlike good stories like *A Cloudy Path*, she doesn't even have a proper reason. One of the stories where Taylor stumbles into forming her own team despite having zero qualities of a leader and being unlikable. The Avatar stuff is uninspired, and relies on the cosmological worldbuilding from Korra, most of which is really stupid. This is the only story on this list that I dropped.

  * [A Beginner's Guide to Stealing Brockton Bay](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-beginners-guide-to-stealing-brockton-bay-worm-persona.615233/) updates slooow. It hasn't gotten out of what I would consider the first real arc, even at 130k words, but it treats Persona well, and Akira is a real treat to read.

  * [It Starts With One](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/it-starts-with-one-worm-au.708580/) is [Tank](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/tank-worm-altpowertaylor-au-complete.700525/) but with less irony this time. A retelling of the recent recession from the perspective of billionaire-assassin Taylor, impressionable revolutionary Aisha, immortal pillar of the establishment Alexandria, and the detective looking into the weird case of industrial capitalists having a "change of heart"... I enjoyed this one a little more than I should have. It's interesting, but if the subject matter is hot-button, as evidenced by the thread being locked.

  * [The Shadow Over Brockton Bay](https://archiveofourown.org/works/18761293/chapters/44507374) is edgy basically the same way Kaleidoscope is. I thought it was fun.

  * Aaaaand finally, [Imperator](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/imperator-w-bravely-second-complete.612434/). Mauling Snarks got me over my hangups with the "Taylor has a mysterious and unexplained new father figure" genre of wormfic, no matter how bad it was, so I've been going through stories I couldn't stand before. It's a relatively short and "completed" story, with an ongoing sequel. A con (or selling point, if you prefer) is that the POV character is Denys Geneolgia from Bravely Second rather than Taylor. I was skeptical about that before I read it, but now that I've moved on to the sequel, I have to concede that the author is way better at writing Denys as a POV character than Taylor (who is the POV character of the sequel). The writing is okay, if a bit garrulous.

  **Ratings:**

  Not gonna do ratings this time because I'm running out of time to write this post, and they're all honestly pretty mediocre. Try out Son of Man(nis) first, because that's the one that's most likely to resonate with the audience of /r/rational. TTSS is my favorite on an emotional level. After that, role some dice? Pick whatever story sounds interesting that I didn't explicitly not recommend. Or do whatever you want.

  - u/Bowbreaker:
    ```
    Most of your fanfic recommendations in this thread seem to be presented as if you already read all the *good* stuff available within those fandoms and now make due with shifting through the dregs that are left to at least find some halfway mediocre stuff to scratch that itch.

    So my question is, what is the actual good stuff that led you down this path? What would you recommend to someone new, who has not yet jumped into the fandom sea and not yet exhausted its quality content?
    ```

    - u/sibswagl:
      ```
      Worm, more than a lot of other fandoms (in my experience), has a vast majority of unfinished fics. There are a lot of good unfinished fics, and a handful of good finished fics. This is a fairly random sampling, based on my bookmarks. This is far from the only good stories; I'd recommend /r/WormFanfic if you want more.

      Finished:

      * [Tabloid](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/tabloid-worm-artfic-%E2%80%94-complete.455278/) is a story about a PRT photographer. This is a character study, not a action-packed drama.

      * [Completely Unoriginal](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/completely-unoriginal-yet-another-cyoa-si-mc-in-brockton-bay-complete.526825/#post-35103973): This is an SI fic, where the main character gets a pretty OP power and...fucks around with it. Yeah, this is also more of comedy/character study fic. (If that's unsatisfying, he did write a [speed run](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/completely-unoriginal-yet-another-cyoa-si-mc-in-brockton-bay-complete.526825/page-110#post-37184182) version.)

      Unfinished (some updating, some dead):

      * [Constellations](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/constellations-worm-okami.414320/): A comedy/fluff fic about Taylor befriending the main character of *Okami*, Amaterasu. For those unfamiliar with Japanese mythology, Amaterasu is a major deity and about as powerful as the phrase "major deity" implies. That said, the story is more about Taylor attempting to find peaceful solutions to conflict, rather than beating people up with her all powerful god-dog.

      * [Stacked Deck](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/stacked-deck-or-colin-wallis-vs-single-parenting-worm-persona.459689/) is a Persona crossover where Yu is Arsmasters nephew (or something like that, I'm too lazy to find the exact relation) and is placed in his care. Again, this is more of a character study/slice of life fic, not Yu beating up the gangs of Brockton.

      * [Dire Worm](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/dire-worm-worm-au-oc.300816/) is a crossover with a fake (at the time, it now exists) story about a villain named Dire. Dire is pretty much a Doom expy, except more successful with her schemes. A humor/action story, this one *does* involve beating up the gangs of Brockton.

      * [El-Ahrairah](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/el-ahrairah-worm.372987/) is an alt!power where Taylor triggers with a Trump power and is immediately recruited into Cauldron because she's really damn good at analyzing and improving powers. This is probably the fic that comes closest to "rationalizing" the Worm-verse, insofar as the Worm-verse needs rationalizing. It attempts to explain a lot of Cauldron's subpar decision making, mostly by making the Entities and Endbringers a lot scarier.

      * [It Starts With One](https://archiveofourown.org/works/16970325/chapters/39885288): In a world without parahumans, a girl (we haven't technically been told it's Taylor yet) still gets powers and starts carving a bloody path through the world's rich and powerful. The results are about what you'd expect. This fic is half a mystery, with an OC non-powered person investigating and trying to figure out what's going on, and half following Taylor's actions.

    It's interesting that you find this a problem - to me Ward felt like its own story enough (with its own gaping plot holes) that it didn't bother me at all, and I was glad to see this return. Admittedly I did end up dropping Ward...

      If you didn't make it too far I'd recommend giving Ward another chance. I initially dropped Ward then found the audiobook podcast and am really enjoying it now that I've gotten further into it. 

      Not having as much setting mystery and the heavy handed metaphors hurt the beginning of Ward a lot in my opinion, but it gets better. Worm also has a rough start in my opinion, we've all just forgotten about it.

      Edit: I'd also recommend the "We've got Ward" podcast alongside it, especially if you enjoy narrative discussions.

  Anyone know of any DnD 5e podcasts where the players do smart things and know the rules well? I feel like a lot of DnD podcasts have a cast of not very clever characters, and the players and DM are pretty bad with the 5e system. 

  In Critical Role, for example, spellcasters will regularly have to spend 30 seconds on their turn scrolling through their character sheet to find their spellcasting ability modifier, a number that they use *on a majority of turns*. In The Adventure Zone spells are often blatantly misused, like when a character casts Planar Binding while ignoring the 1-hour casting time. 

  I'm having a really hard time finding a podcast with competent, clever players. Most focus on comedy or drama instead. Do you guys have any recommendations?

        I think flow.

        You can feel it when you have to reread sentences frequently. Usually, the biggest disruptor of flow is that the sentences don't "naturally" link to the next, forcing you to constantly change context.

        When the premise is good enough, you can ignore some flow issues.
        ```

    - u/lsparrish:
      ```
      There are a lot of plot elements in common with MoL, such as a world ending event that caps the ending of the time loop, multiple other powerful loopers, interactions with aliens with a self-consistent yet inhuman psychology, and politics. It also has a mana-like technomagical system.

      Unlike MoL, it has a game interface of sorts, which so far just measures one's progress as a psychic/energy battery, and reputation with various factions. Similar to MoL, the first loop sets up a bunch of mysteries/conundrums to be solved later. It's only 33 chapters in, and depending how it is handled I could see it going downhill as the mysteries are solved and the character becomes super powerful, but for the time being I'd recommend it to MoL fans as something they might like.

    Also, the "no idiotic secret societies that have to mind-wipe people to stay in existence" requirement: would stories with *non-idiotic* secret societies that have to mind-wipe people to stay in existence be acceptable?
    ```

    - u/Teulisch:
      ```
      the mind-wipe thing is lazy writing, in most cases. harry potter, men in black, and so on, they all use it as a cheap excuse for why nobody knows about the hidden world. but it requires action, and that means as population increases you will start to miss people. people who could write things down and share information before caught. you hit a point past which it becomes impossible to keep the hidden world secret. 

      mostly im annoyed with how its primary use is to cover the largest plothole in the story, and just casually hand-wave the problem away without consideration of how it would change the worldbuilding. 1984 with mindwipes would be an entirely different book, and much more horrifying in a lot of ways- nobody breaks the law, because nobody can remember the ones who do.
      ```

      - u/sephirothrr:
        ```
        I think you're overlooking that the mindwipes are explicitly only for the things that fall through the cracks - there are already plenty of precautions in place for the secret society to remain secret.

        That said, you are correct that as population increases those incidents will increase as well, but there's no reason that innovation on methods of secrecy has to completely stop, and if nothing else that issue makes a great backdrop for fanfiction.

    [Post Human](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/22848/post-human/) and [Interviewing Leather](https://banter-latte.com/portfolio/interviewing-leather/) are both pretty rational and are excellent stories featuring entirely adult (well, close enough, for Post Human's case) characters.

    They're also both fairly short, as far as webserial stuff usually goes.

  Hello, I am looking for alternate history fiction, any timeframe is appreciated.

  Also, sometime ago I red alternate history fiction on some forum about selfinsert in to British airforce command during ww2 and I any search combination does not work to find it. 

  All I remember it was a fic on some forum from POW of a historian selfinsert in to a body and life of [Arthur Travers Harris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Arthur_Harris,_1st_Baronet), this fic or anything simmilar would also be cool.

  edit: second request is probably a bit off, but from what I remember, characters behaved fairly rationally and adapted to changes brought by selfinsert.

    ```
    Not what you requested, but you will probably enjoy the beginning of [Wearing Robert's Crown](https://archiveofourown.org/works/6833305/chapters/15597619). Personally, I thought it turned bad when the White Walkers showed up, but the part before that is solid, minimal-fantasy alternate "history".
    ```

    I have been reading "[When in Rome, A Savoy Monarchy SI](https://www.alternatehistory.com/forum/threads/when-in-rome-a-savoy-monarchy-si.453787/)", where the main character is an SI as the king of Italy Victor Emannuel III a few years before WWI. It is on alternatehistory.com
    ```

    ```
    British airforce self-insert: [And They Shall Reap the Whirlwind](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/and-they-shall-reap-the-whirlwind-ww2-insert.547249/), found by searching 'spacebattles bomber harris self-insert'. I enjoyed the premise and the SI's struggles to maintain his persona while faking a dramatic change of heart to explain the new direction of his strategies, but the >!Catholic church prophecies and assassins!< were a bit much for me.

    Lately I've been reading a few military alt-history fics that put an emphasis on LGBT representation.

    [The Solstice War](https://spiritsofeden.com/) is a long-running web serial following not-WWII in Socialist not-India/Russia against not-Germany/USA. It's a fun read, but if you're looking for realism there are some magical elements >!that become more relevant in later arcs!<.

    [Castles of Steel](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/castles-of-steel-lesbians-good-imperialism-bad.51361/) and [Aircraft Design Company](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/aircraft-design-company-matsuras-planes-are-always-fastest.48927/) are two quests by the same author, both set in not-Japan around the time of the not-Russo-Japanese war. Castles of Steel follows the first woman in the Navy and is more focused on military life and politics, while Aircraft Design Company is heavily inspired by The Wind Rises and is serving as a playtest for the detailed aircraft design rules in the Flying Circus RPG.

  Looking for a short story I read a while ago, it features a man who was questioning his religion because he couldn't find any answers to his questions. To solve this he decides to join the priesthood. As he advances up the ranks, he keeps getting told that to find his answers he has to speak with God by becoming the pope. The story ends with him realising that God actually has no power or something like that.

  I've decided to dump every bookmark that's in my reading list. Not everything is rat-fic, but for the most part its all good.
