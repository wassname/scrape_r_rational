## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  People on podcasts and youtube videos speak really unreasonably slowly, so I started to speed them up. 1.5x speed seemed to do the trick. 

  But then I increased the speed to 2x, and that was really nice because now I can eat podcasts at about the same rate that I can read the transcripts (or a little slower, but not so much that it's frustrating). I'm kind of annoyed that my iPhone won't go for x2.5 speed, because there are some podcasts that are still slow enough by default that I could handle the increase. 

  On the rare occasion that I listen to a podcast on a slower speed (usually because I'm taking copious notes), everyone sounds strangely lethargic. 

  EDIT: Wow. This is getting a lot of attention for what I thought would basically be an interesting curiosity for maybe one or two people.

    I think it must be a matter of signal processing in versus signal processing out. We can intake information far faster than we can output it, and once you realize that you start to wonder why you'd ever want to limit your intake to someone else's output. I find it especially noticeable for unscripted stuff, because people have to think about what they're saying, which further slows output. That goes double for a Let's Play, where a fair amount of effort is being spent on playing the game.

      Plus some games are pretty slow-paced. I have to watch Overwatch match commentary on x1, but Hearthstone makes me regret that youtube only goes to x2.

        I use [this html5 youtube playback speed controller](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/youtubevideospeedcontroller/?src=ss)

        I haven't really tested the limits of what is possible, but right now I have hotkeys mapped for speeds through 3x - which is faster than I can usually use.
        ```

      - u/alexanderwales:
        ```
        I don't watch Hearthstone anymore, but when I did I had to find those few players who actually did some editing to cut out thinking/waiting time, and even then I watched with the speed turned up. There are some games where editing is basically required if it wants to be anything other than background noise. Kaizo Mario levels and Hitman are two more that come to mind, especially since quite a bit of Hitman is waiting around for enemies to path into the right position.
        ```

    I'm not much of a podcast listener, but I do that most of the time when I watch youtube videos that aren't music. Less with, say, vihart or the vlogbrothers, who already speak pretty fast. 

    Really, this is one reason I prefer text. I can move on from a sentence as soon as I'm done with it - and no sooner, if it's something that takes awhile to parse. Speeding up and occasionally pausing a video helps, but it's not as natural.

    Out of curiosity, if you listen to RW, do you find it too slow as well? I'm often told I speak too quickly, so was just curious if your preference is from the whole class of [people not speaking as fast as I can read,] which I've found frustrating at times too :)
    ```

    - u/alexanderwales:
      ```
      I listen to RW at x2 speed, which is my default for unscripted content or audiobooks (I play movies and television at normal speed most of the time, because usually someone is paying attention to the pacing, timing, and information density).

      (I mean obviously I've already heard what we have to say, but I'd listen at x2 speed regardless.)
      ```

    - u/callmebrotherg:
      ```
      I listen to RW on 2x speed, but I foresee that being a comfortable speed for a long while, and probably permanently (I don't think I could speed it up more without the words blurring into each other).
      ```

      - u/DaystarEld:
        ```
        And I'm still intelligible? Excellent: now next time someone tells me I speak too fast I'll just tell them that it isn't even my final form!

        I guess it goes back to what you said about people just talking slower in podcasts/videos, which I may be unconsciously doing. I'll try to pay more attention to that, though hopefully it doesn't mess up your personal tweaking :)
        ```

  - u/AmeteurOpinions:
    ```
    I've done this for years. It's one of the bigger advantages of the medium, I think.

    I also increase the watch speed whenever I can for YouTube or anime sites, sometimes going as high as x4 when possible. Just don't try it with *The Tatami Galaxy*. That was slightly too fast, even for me.

    (The stupid 4-6 hours per week of Survivor podcast I listen to, even on double speed, gives me a backlog by the end of the season. Now the finale's happened it'll go down to a more manageable 1-2 hours a week and I will no longer be perpetually a month behind!)

      It's an interesting idea. I've been in a handful of more structured living scenarios, and one can definitely see how I approached the values of the group, and so the idea of such a group where the values seem about as close to ideal as can be hoped for is actually pretty exciting. 

      Were I single I would be seriously considering what moves I'd have to make to be in a position to apply. As is I doubt I could hack it, and prior commitments leave me unable to even consider it, I think. 

      Get back to me in 25 years, tho, and we'll see which way the wind blows.

    - u/CouteauBleu:
      ```
      Mhhh... interesting. I'm not done reading yet, but I already have a few points.

      Quick question: how final is this supposed to be? This feels like a working draft, where each chapter has a coherent philosophy, set of priority and "A leads to B leads to C" structure unifying every sentence, but the whole document doesn't have a coherent structure unifying every chapter.

      EDIT: Also, who is this document intended for? If it's for the people in your house, then I'm not going to be one of them, and they already know most of what you're writing. What message are you trying to pass other than "I'm doing this, wish me good luck"? I mean, it doesn't have to be more than that, but then again you say it's a charter and you format it like a charter, so I wondering who is supposed to read it.

      - u/DaystarEld:

        I can tell you what I got out of it, as someone who specifically asked for ongoing posts: I view it as an experiment, which he mentions a few times is pretty much what it is. When you perform an experiment, it helps to have regular documentation made public to stake your claims in the public sphere, both for personal accountability and for the integrity of the experiment. It allows you and others to look at it and say "This is what the goal is, this is how they intend to do it, now we know what to look forward to."  It's even more useful in the retrospective, to see the evolution of a project.

        Also, it's a handy way to get critiques, which he also mentioned being a motivator. Wanting something to succeed means wanting to ensure that you get every scrap of potential feedback you reasonably can.
        ```

        - u/CouteauBleu:
          ```
          Yeah, I phrased my question poorly, and more aggressively than I intended.

          My intended meaning was a Litterature-class-style "Who is your target audience?" I'm mostly asking because if the target audience includes people outside of LW, then that post has way too many unexplained references to LW context (I had to look a few up).
          ```

      - u/TK17Studios:
        ```
        It was largely created as a defense against a sense that people within the community were aligning against it/me from a straw understanding, the idea being "well, if people are going to hate this, let's at least have them hate what it *actually is.*"

        Then it occurred to me that transparency was (basically) a fundamental good anyway, so even if I was wrong about people lookin' at me funny it was worth making public.

        The intended audience, then, is primarily "people who are socially only one or two steps removed from people who will be in the house."  I share it here on r/rational off-topic just because I suspect people might be curious and because it contrasts interestingly with how I'm writing r!Animorphs characters' sense of cooperation.

        Something like 90% final, or "final in spirit" but flexible in detail.

  I got my hands on Witcher 3: Game of the Year Edition months ago and *finally* found the time to play it, only to find out my PC doesn't meet the minimum system requirements. My graphics card doesn't have enough Dedicated Video RAM and there doesn't seem to be a way to increase it on Windows 7. 

  The whole reason I waited this long to play the game was that I can't afford a console and am too frugal to spend full price on a game. Even if I was willing to fork over $200 on a new graphics card I don't know how to install it or whether it would be compatible with my desktop. So I'm **really** frustrated right now.

  ***

  I started reading the Avatar fanfic [What I Learned at SRU](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6417590/1/What-I-Learned-at-SRU), which transplants the characters into a fictional university in our world with no fantastic elements. It's basically the college version of a high school AU, which I picked up literally the day after I graduated from college myself, and so far I'm loving it. 

  It's characters I already like just living life and facing mundane conflicts while being really friendly to each other. It makes me happy and it's very well-written for a slice of life story, so I'm recommending it after just a few chapters. It may even qualify as rational, but I don't really care about that right now.

  I've been considering watching anime with subtitles instead of sticking to English dubs, but I want to mentally acclimate myself to it by sticking to ones with slower, more prose-esque writing. My biggest concerns being distracted from the visuals by constantly looking down or the dialogue coming too fast for my puny pleeb mind.

  My reason for this is...oh screw it, I just want to watch Re:Creators. I know there are plenty of great shows out there to binge, but this is series has caught my attention and is making me seriously reconsider my dubs-only policy. Is it a good gateway show, and if it isn't then what is?

    Replacing the video card is, (on a desktop), one of the simpler upgrades one can perform. Two Phillips screws to open the case, one or two screws to free the old video card, then it's just pulling it out of the slot and replacing with the new one, which is only slightly more difficult than swapping an N64 cartridge at an angle.

    Actually identifying if a given card is compatible with your motherboard, cpu, and power supply, and small enough to fit in your case, is actually much more work, all told. You have to consider the wattage (and whether your power supply has enough to spare / has the right power connectors), the PCIe slot setup of the motherboard, and whether your CPU has enough PCIe lanes. 

    If you want to download [CPU-Z](http://www.cpuid.com/softwares/cpu-z.html), a program that will give you information on your hardware, I could take a shot at helping you sort all of that out, if you're interested.
    ```

    - u/trekie140:
      ```
      [Here's the info from CPU-Z.](https://www.dropbox.com/s/adrhe7upouwnuaf/PC.txt?dl=0) Thank you.
      ```

      - u/ketura:
        ```
        I can't find any decent information on motherboards for that CPU architecture, and CPU-Z registers components on the motherboard but not the motherboard's model number/manufacturer itself, so I'll have to make some guesses.

        Alright, so judging by the CPU, this is a system roughly five years old, right? Based entirely on this, I *think* the motherboard won't have any problems.  Your old AMD HD 7570 uses the same PCI-E x16 that any modern card would use, so it will physically plug in, at least.  The fact that the CPU is working with that PCIe interface means that it will work as well.  So that's two out of the four major concerns.

        The remaining two potential issues are size and power draw.

        For size, [this is an image of a Radeon HD 7570](https://images10.newegg.com/NeweggImage/ProductImageCompressAll1280/A4GH_131305274018370460jxIw42qd0Q.jpg?w=660&h=500), probably a decent approximation of what you have inside your box.  Note that it's low profile; the back doesn't hang much over the actual physical cartridge slot (the yellow bit on the bottom), and the card's height is well lower than the height of the backplate. [Here is the front view](https://images10.newegg.com/NeweggImage/ProductImageCompressAll1280/A4GH_131305274007901256TPWHnHwGCr.jpg?w=660&h=500), or the part that you actually plug your monitor into.  Note that it's one slot wide, just enough room for a row of ports.

        [Here's an image of a stock GTX 770](http://gpuboss.com/img/gpus/-9223372036849444355/27d8ee24c1a6a08cad7e837c395b55b8-400-256), which is more or less like the one /u/adad64 brought up (the different manufacturers all have different fan designs, etc, but the basic size will be about the same).  First thing to note is that it fills the entire height of the slot, but it also hangs over the actual plug itself for several inches.  Long card is looooong.  It's hard to tell exactly how far the card hangs over, but these sorts of cards are usually around a foot long, which as you can see in the image, is more than twice as long as your current card.  

        [And here's the front](https://images10.newegg.com/NeweggImage/ProductImageCompressAll1280/14-125-614-07.jpg?w=660&h=500).  Notice that it takes up *two* slots horizontally.   You don't actually need to have a second physical PCI port, but there has to at least be an empty space to mount it in, and if there does happen to be a PCI port in that spot, you can't plug anything into it.

        The only way to know if this will fit in your case is by cracking it open and trying to gauge it.  This is really a toss-up, as I have no idea what kind of case you have, but it's possible that your case isn't long enough--and there's a chance that some component on the motherboard will stick up in the wrong place, which would prevent a long card from fitting (modern motherboards work around the issue, but cards didn't always used to be this long, and the placement of RAM modules in particular used to be an issue once upon a time).

        The last issue is power.  Once again, I wasn't able to glean what exact power supply you have, so we'll have to make some guesswork. I found some recommendations online from when the HD 7570 was still current, and there were reports that power supplies of 250-300 watts would work, so there's our low end.  If your power supply is that low, it absolutely will not work for this card (the 770 pulls that much *by itself*, leaving nothing for the rest of your system).  Recommendations I'm finding online for the 770 suggest a wattage of at least 500-600 W.  

        Besides the actual power rating, tho, the power supply has to have the right cables to go into it--your current card is low-power enough that it can pull all the power it needs from the PCIe port, but that is not the case for more modern cards.  [As you can see in this image](http://www.pcgameshardware.de/screenshots/811x455/2013/05/Nvidia_Geforce_GTX_770_Reference_Design_06.JPG), there are a pair of power plugs in the top-right corner of the card (the lego-looking square plugs).  One is a six-pin, the other an eight-pin.  If your power supply does not contain those plugs tucked away unused somewhere, you won't be able to hook into this card, even if it does somehow grant enough power.

        So, to recap: motherboard: probably fine.  CPU: fine.  PSU: probably insufficient.  Space: inconclusive.

        If you do decide to upgrade, here's what you need to find out:

        * how much room you have in your case to physically fit a card into
        * does your current power supply suffice, or what will you replace *that* with if it's not.

        You mentioned considering waiting to upgrade.  That's perfectly reasonable, but it should be noted that (assuming it fits), there's also little problem in getting the video card and power supply now and using them in your new computer when the time comes.  

        If you do end up buying a power supply to go with the new video card, you'll need [something like this](https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?item=N82E16817139200).  If you click on the Specifications tab, it will list everything relevant that you might need to know. In particular the wattage (this one is 650W), but also the efficiency ("80 PLUS BRONZE Certified" means that at maximum load, the PSU is at least 80% efficient) and the actual plugs that are included (at the bottom under "Features", it lists "2x PCIe Connector", which is what you'd need.  Higher up it lists "2 x 6+2-Pin", which is to say it has two plugs that are arranged in such a way that they can be either 6 or 8 pins if you need them, so one would be used as a 6 pin and the other as the full 8).  

        Anyway.  Sorry for the wall of text, hopefully it was clear enough.  Do let me know if you have any other questions.

        ----

        EDIT: if you can find the make/model of your motherboard and your power supply, I can narrow things down further, but this is probably at least enough info (I hope) for you to make a decently informed decision otherwise.

From a quick google on other people attempting the same upgrade, it seems like it would fit just fine in the case it comes with and work with the motherboard, but the PSU is not going to cut it. You'd need to get a new [Power Supply](https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817153232&cm_re=600w-_-17-153-232-_-Product) somewhere that's at least 600w.

        That image only shows the CPU, which is only a small piece of the puzzle. The program I linked in my other comment will give a more comprehensive readout. 

        As an aside, I typically have random internet strangers send to my local The UPS Store, which charges like $3 to recieve packages. I'd find one nearby and find out their policy / charges, but it's usually a very painless procedure, and a means of obfuscating all but the general vicinity of where you live.

    The only way you can really aclimate yourself to it again will probably be setting a set time and ritual for when you go to bed :/ Melatonin also only needs to be taken in sub milligram ranges to have the full effect, anything more will leave you groggy.

  Back when I lived in Brussels, I ran its LessWrong meetup (now defunct) and it was fun enough. On moving to London though, I found that I couldn't make myself join the local one (/u/philh). Initially I thought it was just that it's much bigger, and I've got the autist/introvert/anxious thing going.

  But yesterday I went to the second big [Wait But Why](http://waitbutwhy.com/) London meetup, roughly as large, and had a good time.

  I think the relevant difference is that while WBW touches the same topics as the rationalist community, its fanbase is almost entirely disjunct, and also somewhat lower-level in general knowledge. 

  So when someone asks about enlightening articles, I can name-drop [Meditations on Moloch](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/) and not have the whole group say "yeah, yeah, of course, but *besides that*?" And when I say that free will is the qualia of intelligence in a deterministic universe, half the group will go "but what about quantum randomness?" and the other will go "wtf is qualia?" and I can decide if I want to go low-level or high-level.

  I really like to teach this stuff, is what I'm saying. But I don't have a *ton* of original thoughts, so I have to rely on my audience not having read the exact same things I did.

    Just wanted to say I appreciate you tagging me in this - when people stop coming back I don't like to ask why, but I do like to know why. I'm glad you've found a group you enjoy. :)

    I've had that kind of experience too. Never really found what I'd consider a satisfactory way to approach it. 
    You can try reading even *more* esoteric stuff, but it can be hard to find ones you'll like. Then there's the risk of going to far that direction, and ending up interested in topics that can't really be covered in a normal conversation...

  I'm curious, would there be any interest in a northeast Florida rational  meetup?

  I was searching for books that took place in magical academies earlier today. I came across [Vita Nostra](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3972188-vita-nostra). I'm already about half way through, though it did have a rough start. I think I'll finish it tomorrow. I was wondering if anyone else had read it? I couldn't find a legal method of obtaining the english version and had to resort to libgen.

    If you're looking for other books in similar genres, you might be interested in *The Wee Free Men*, by Terry Pratchett. There isn't a magical academy, per se, but there is a... very notable lack of one, so to speak, and the main character is a child who does start learning how to be a witch.

  I'm trying the pomodoro technique for studying and I'm having problems with managing breaks. Either I'm ignoring them and work ith no break (which hurts the outside view i guess) or I end up taking at least 25-30 min breaks but less often (make a sandwich, boil water for tea, read RSS in toilet, that kind of things). What am I supposed to do during short breaks?
