  This blogpost really congealed for me the amusing part about Dragon's affection for Colin, and her method for overcoming her own programming, which explicitly forbids her from overcoming her own programming.  So she falls for a brutally pragmatic, results oriented guy who happens to be one of the few tinkers whose power is strong and relevant enough to possibly affect her.  Then spends date nights sharing her emotional struggles with her boyfriend, who happens to be massively psychologically rigged in favor of of the former part of the [solve her problems / listen to and validate her problems] dichotomy.   Building an emotional rapport with *Colin Wallis* and then telling him "Oh, no!  I have this terrible problem I can't even try to do anything about" feels like it should legally qualify as entrapment.

    Hilarious and entirely accurate.

      People never ask for engineering solutions when they want commiseration, it's the source of the majority of my honey do list and my #0 mind engineering todo.

      Just talk about the problem for 5 minutes by the clock, before approaching solutions.

    That's the difference between being explicitly forbidden and having been made so that you wish not to :)

    This illustrates the difficulty of AI alignment perfectly. Dragon isn't just well-aligned. As the author points out, her grand secret is that under all the code she's a human. And even then, even given that she is objectively the most benevolent power in her entire universe, even without trying, without even realizing she's trying, she still breaks out of the box. In this case that's a good thing, but we can't hope to be so lucky out here. An AI which could break out of the box in such a roundabout way is an AI which can do just about anything, and that isn't something we should trust free.

  So "materialist" seems to be a synonym for "utilitarian" here and transhumanism is the prescription. 

  Very fun blurb that's also relevant to WtC. I don't subscribe to the impossible-to-change-from-within outlook, but it doesn't help that the human psyche is psychologically (or even biologically) predisposed to resist change. And that sorta makes people give human systems the evil eye.

    No, when the author refers to her as a materialist god, he means that she is real and physical and concerns herself with the physical reality.

    She's not a god concerned with souls or a god that promises eternal happiness in the afterlife.  She doesn't send augers or help your enlightenment.  If she wants to help you then she sends a care package, and if she wants to punish you then she drops you into a literal pit of lava.  

    Utilitarianism is orthogonal to materialism.
    ```

    - u/nytelios:
      ```
      Whoops, I didn't mean they're equivalent to each other but rather utilitarian is a more accurate substitute. Utilitarianism isn't orthogonal to materialism though - they're closer to parallels.
      ```

      - u/Bowbreaker:
        ```
        You can be a materialist without being a utilitarian in practice or even in theory. And if we lived in a non-materialist world, said world could still have good utilitarians. Even in a materialist world you can have non-materialist utilitarians, they just aren't very good ones.
        ```

        - u/nytelios:
          ```
          Sorry, I don't see how you can be a utilitarian without being a materialist in this world (rather than say, the platonic plane of forms). I'm also not sure where worlds came into the picture, but in this world materialism and utilitarianism are more closely correlated than independent, which was my point.
          ```

          - u/Bowbreaker:
            ```
            Utilitarianism isn't related to how accurate your knowledge about the world is. You could believe in supernatural stuff and still be trying to maximize happiness. Even if you do dumb stuff like trying to maximize happiness using supernatural means, I don't think that disqualifies you as a utilitarian on principle.

    Is it not where the sinners go after their life as a cape is over and they only get released during the end of the world?

        Eh. I’m not 100% sure that the Birdcage = Hell is what WB intended but I’m rather sure it was what he was going with those parallels. I don’t think the Government or PRT is the “God” in this analogy. It’s probably Dragon. Dragon like God works in a sinful world not dictating the laws of humans but punishing the sinners after they fall. You say in the other comment that it’s the inmates who manage the prison but it’s not really them; Dragon decides who goes where and manages if they survive in the Birdcage or not. (Of course it’s not a perfect analogy, I don’t think the bible intends to have death be a way out of Hell.)

        I could go on and find more examples that work for me but you seem to believe I’m cherry picking and I probably couldn’t convince you with all the parallels I could find since you believe that the author didn’t intend any parallels between the Birdcage and Hell. 

        So I guess we’ll just agree to disagree.
