## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  Unexpected rational world-building in a glowfic I'm reading:

  So the protagonist is transported to a magical realm. Among other oddities, the Earth is flat. Whatever, that's just a standard fantasy thing, I'll roll with it.

  And then she gets the chance to chat with a minor god, and it turns out that no, there's a story behind it.

  The gods started out not knowing how physics worked. They built a flat disk world, because intuitively that seemed like the right shape for people to live on, but it didn't have enough mass so nothing would stick to the surface.

  They eventually figured out the mass/gravity thing. So they naively fixed their prototype by extend the disk into a *giant cylinder*. Gravity is still fucked up near the edges, so they clumsily patched the worst of it with magic, and installed a mortal-detector so that any explorer that wandered too close to the fucked-up regions could be politely turned around. 

  By the time they realized that a sphere would work way better, there were already mortals living on the flat bit, and planet remodelling releases far too much waste heat.

  **edit:** "Also when we introduced oxygen there was a mass extinction event. There were actually several of them."

    That sounds kind of like [Mistborn Spoiler](#s "how the various people to achieve god-like power in the Mistborn series consistently screwed things up. They didn't know what the world was supposed to look like, or exactly why certain things were even happening, and so their "fixes" broke more things than they solved and required completely destroying the planet's ecosystem and rebuilding it from scratch in under five minutes. Which went predictably poorly.")

    What's a glowfic?
    ```

    - u/Roxolan:
      ```
      It's a form of multi-author fanfic/roleplay, told primarily through dialogue. Often spending rather more time on character development and world-building than on advancing any sort of plot.

      Authors typically re-use their favourite characters a lot, except reborn in one setting or another. The main protagonist is often female, and often overpowered for one reason or another. The "portal fantasy" plot is super common. Crossovers between glowfics used to be super common, now less so.

      It's a descendant from rationalfic, in that the original ones were written by Alicorn (and Kappa) using the personality of Alicorn's rational!Bella from the Twilight rationalfic Luminosity (itself directly inspired by HPMOR). Characters are generally rational, sometimes even rationalist, though settings and plots not necessarily so.

    >Gravity is still fucked up near the edges

    Wouldn't it just slope diagonally down and towards the center, making it feel like a hill?  If the disk is large enough that observers can't see the whole thing, and automatically adjust their perception of "down", then when you walk towards the edge it should appear as if you are walking up a hill that gradually gets steeper and steeper.  If the inhabitants didn't have a good theory of gravity and built a map of the world out of local maps, they would think it was shaped like a wide bowl, with a flat part for most of the world but slanted uphill around the edges.  And funtionally, it would be pretty much identical to living in a world that actually was shaped like a bowl and had gravity pointing uniformly in one direction.

    So I don't think your mortal-detector is necessary for gravitational purposes, it would only be needed to prevent people from falling off the edge (or peering over it, or noticing it exists, if your gods care about that)
    ```

      > Wouldn't it just slope diagonally down and towards the center, making it feel like a hill?

      Yup. Unfortunately, the inhabitants are Tolkien elves (or at least a fanfic of them, I don't know the lore well enough to tell), whose eyesight is good enough that they can tell their planet is flat by sight when the weather's good.

      I don't remember the exact reasoning for the mortal-detector, maybe it *was* just for people falling off the edge. Gods don't particularly keep all this secret, they just want the world to behave as originally intended.

      [Leave of Absence](https://www.glowfic.com/posts/212), by Alicorn and lintamande.

      I did say "glowfic", which in this case is shorthand for "the clever, highly driven Bella Swan from [a particular Twilight rationalfic](http://luminous.elcenia.com/) is reincarnated in Loki from a genderswapped Marvel Cinematic Universe, who is stranded on Middle-Earth during the events of the Silmarillion. The story is very long and primarily told via dialogue."

      Delve into glowfic at your own risks, it's a bit of a rabbit hole and the quality is variable.

        ```
        I swear I don't mean any offense, but I've never seen the point in reading Glowfics, the format is just horrible and as you said quality comes and goes seemingly randomly. Really seems like the kind of thing that is made for the writers instead of the readers.

        Could you try to sell the idea of them to me? I'd like to give them another try, since I keep hearing of them, but I just can't bring myself to knowing what I know.

        - u/Roxolan:
          ```
          No offence taken. You are quite correct. I don't go around *recommending* glowfic; I think people who would enjoy it are a minority even in this sub.

          What attracts me to the genre despite its flaws is: 

          * Conversations between intelligent and eminently reasonable people. That practically *never* happens outside rationalfic, and even within the genre it's not normally the focus.

          (I'm just coming back from the new *Star Wars*, and **boy is this on my mind right now**.)

          * *Romance* between intelligent and eminently reasonable people. Same.

          * Protagonist is powerful and wins. Wish-fulfilment is the sugar of fanfic, in that it makes it easy to like a fic but will make you nauseous if that's all the fic has to offer. Well, glowfic is dangerously sweet, to be sure. I did use the original as one of the examples in [my rant on the topic](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/41zkkw/d_yudkowskys_first_law_of_science_fiction_a_rant/). But good glowfics temper it by regularly throwing new, diverse, and at times horrifying problems for the protagonist to curbstomp, and that works well enough for me. Or I drop the glowfic and pick a fresh one whose problems haven't been solved yet.

  Today I've spend the entire day researching ISP logistics and their impact on net neutrality, mostly to be able to rant about it. I'm super proud of that rant, so here is the relevant parts:

  ---

  > Can you elaborate on the second paragraph? I feel it's a strawman to say "Using your argument, [exaggeration], which seems absurd".

  It's basically the essence of the libertarianism debate, which is always tricky to navigate. The first three "levels" of debate are usually more or less:

  * Level 1: Companies want to make more money. If we don't keep them in check, they'll provide lousier services / charge more for their services.

  * Level 2: But then wouldn't all companies have an incentive to make everything as expensive as possible, since they want lots of money? Why isn't everything in the world just expensive enough that we can barely buy it without going broke, but not any cheaper? Clearly, since cheap things exist, it means the invisible hand of the market is keeping prices down.

  * Level 3: Okay, yes, in practice companies compete with each other, but only when they have to. Sometimes they also collude, or they independently provide lousy quality on metrics the average consumer doesn't know about when buying.

  Your answer to my post is closer to level 3, your original post closer to level 1, which is the point I was more or less making.

  >  However, I'd add that they're already colluding, merging, and organizing with a mutually vested interest in making the above sort of thing a reality. You can't pit one against another in the free market. They have no reason to fight when they can cooperate to screw the rest of us.

  > I'd very much disagree that it's the answer, as you suggest, to focus on breaking up the companies or ensuring competition. Would it be good if it happened? Yes. But in my view, that's a herculean task

  I don't know how things are going in Canada, but in France, this is roughly what happened.

  We had three companies sharing a monopoly after the sector was privatized (Orange, SFR, Bouygues); then Free arrived, drove all the prices down, and [made a buttload of money in the process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_%28ISP%29#Profitability). I think the cheapest offer is currently SFR Red at 20€/month for 200Mb/s down. The ISPs are now in a brutal deathmatch to see who can cover the country in three layers of optical fibers first (ok, not really, but [kinda](http://advanced-television.com/2017/07/14/altice-sfr-to-fibre-france-without-public-money/)).

  And, honestly I'm not sure how we got there. Part of it is a lot of public investment in infrastructure (the one thing France does right), and aggressive local-loop unbundling which means we have like a billion different (mostly regional) LECs. Part of it is Xavier Niel (Free's CEO) being a crazily aggressive businessman. But from where I'm standing, healthy competition between ISPs really isn't a decades-away utopia.

  > * We've seen them throttle netflix and youtube both in the past gouging a company in the process (see first link there), and they tested the waters again recently

  I think this is one area where the "We must defend ourselves from ISPs" mentality is actually harmful.

  I see a lot of people arguing "We need neutrality, that means everyone has the same service for the same price!". This is a bad net neutrality definition, because it's a [leaky abstraction](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/11/11/the-law-of-leaky-abstractions/) of the infrastructure the internet is built on. This is also not [the definition Google uses](https://publicpolicy.googleblog.com/2008/12/net-neutrality-and-benefits-of-caching.html).

  I think the basic concept is intuitive: different services have different costs. You can't send a 40kg package for the same price as a postcard, because transporting the package is more expensive. Internet consumers don't really see that, because once you've paid people to dig up the trenches and lay the cables needed to download your kitten video, actually sending the video is basically free (which is why all non-mobile internet subscriptions nowadays are mostly unlimited; you're not costing your ISP anything by downloading 2GB more, the cost is in recouping previous investments).

  On the other hand, while consumers don't need to be aware of the logistics of transporting data, it's a vital concern for ISPs and big content providers. If Youtube sent their data directly from their three-per-continent datacenters using the same methods as your average blog / small scale commercial website, they'd be overloading both their datacenters and the ISPs [every time they needed to send 3Mb/s of data to a million users at the same time](https://www.netmanias.com/en/post/blog/6068/google-google-global-cache-hls-iptv-ott-video-streaming-youtube/do-google-global-caches-ggcs-serve-youtube-live-traffic-as-well-or-not).

  The simplest way to solve that problem is to redirect the users to a [CDN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network), that is, a fleet of smaller datacenters spread throughout the target area, which are each sent a cache of the relevant data. However, you're still sending huge amounts of the same data over and over again between the master server, the ISPs and the cache servers; that's not an issue for most sites, but Youtube and Netflix and co need to optimize that stuff aggressively, or else incur non-trivial costs and load times.

  So what they do is cut the middleman and directly pay ISPs to host their CDNs closer to the metal. These are called [Google Global Cache](http://whiteafrican.com/2008/07/04/google-kenya-and-the-google-global-cache/) and... [Netflix Open Connect](https://openconnect.netflix.com/en/), I think?

  Anyway, that was a long explanation, but I have two points:

  - Issues between major content providers and ISPs are extremely complex; beyond "these guys are trying to racket these other guys". Major content providers [have power over ISPs](https://ispspeedindex.netflix.com/) too, [and don't always use it responsibly](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/12/netflix-accused-of-creating-fast-lanes-at-the-expense-of-competitors/). People assume that any slowdown is malicious (eg: [the link you sent me](https://www.macrumors.com/2017/07/21/verizon-throttling-netflix-traffic/)) even when it could plausibly be a technical problem because of non-updated protocols or something.

  - *Nobody* is talking about this stuff. People and media are competing to see who can sound most outraged repeating each other's arguments, but nobody is interested in the logistics behind ISPs. This is like if mail delivery companies were caught colluding with some restaurants / furniture stores / whatever over their concurrent, then everyone started screaming THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS EVERY MAIL SHOULD COST THE SAME. There is a real problem, but it's complicated, and people are pushing this complexity away by turning this into *us vs them*.

  Now, to be clear, I'm not denying that throttling is bad, and I'm not denying it happens on a large scale (I'm not seeing undeniable evidence one way or another).

  But I'm skeptical that legislation can have much of an impact for net neutrality. You can't make a law that says ISPs can't sell faster connection privileges, because then we couldn't have Youtube in 720p at peak hour without crashing the network. And I'm guessing that "You can sell different speeds to different companies, but not in a way that stifles concurrence" is blurrier, harder to make into coherent laws, and harder to enforce.

  The Google employee I linked defined Net Neutrality as "Broadband providers can engage in activities like colocation and caching, so long as they do so on a non-discriminatory basis."; eg, you can pay more for better speeds, but every content provider has to be offered the same prices (and presumably, companies can make a business of buying ISP cache space in bulk to redistribute it to smaller companies). I think this the ideal realistic outcome, and I don't think this can be achieved through regulation. Which is why encouraging competition is *the* answer.

  ---

  tl;dr: Internet is complicated. Netflix has to rent special server space to ISPs else it wouldn't be able to function; this is not an injustice, it's a logistic fact. Laws are good but concurrence is better. I'm sick to death of seeing people repeat each other's arguments and post the same parody "internet packages" image from 15 years ago. Internet in France is great.

  Also, Xavier Niel is awesome. I really wish I'd gone for 42 instead of Epitech :(

  EDIT: Crap, does that register as US Politics? I didn't even think about it, I was mostly going after the logistics / technical parts. I guess it's probably okay as long as I only talk about the economic aspects and not the "The President did X" aspects.

  Skipped last week for lack of anything to talk about, sorry. This week at least had me poking at code for the first time in a while;  I am unsure if my recent motivation is more due to beginning to take 4000 IU of vitamin D3 at night, or due to the confidence boost from getting the most bitchin’ haircut I’ve ever had in my life.  Either way, I’ll take it, but I hope it’s the D3, as that seems much more reliably available.  


  I set up the repo and got Ember and Semantic UI talking with each other, but my lack of experience is certainly felt.  In Visual Studio it’s *so easy* to throw a UI together and iterate on its behavior, and I don’t just say that as someone who’s used it for a couple decades.  Back when I was *12* I could throw together GUIs like nobody’s business using the precursors of the modern tooling, but in web development it really feels like I’m straining to reach my arms under the bed to solve a rubick’s cube purely by touch. 


  It doesn’t help that every resource I can find is geared towards trying to explain the *language* of javascript to me when that’s not what’s confusing.  I can pick up the language details as I go thankyewverymuch, I just need something to point me in the right direction as far as grokking the *workflow* and organization; how do these files interlock with one another, where does my logic need to go, **why the shit does a simple application need four separate languages**, etc etc.  Part of this is my own doing, since I’ve essentially randomly chosen two sets of libraries to work with, but oh well.

  I might actually spend a few minutes laying out what I want to see in Visual Studio and then use it as a guideline as I hit the browser until it does what I want.  That seems like a decent plan.

  I’ll probably not get a whole lot done this weekend, as my brother is graduating from college and for some reason I’m expected to be there, after which we’re also getting roped into an early chrismas celebration.  Here’s hoping it’s not too big a speed bump.

    Have you tried looking into Immediate Mode GUIs? `Semantic` looks nice, but it also looks very Retained Mode, which accounts for a lot of "How the hell do you go from this code to that result?" types of problems.

    On the other hand, Retained Mode GUIs are the norm, and Immediate Modes are harder to find. The one I know about is `dear_imgui`, but it's intended more for debugging than actual game menus (and the workflow isn't even that easy to grok).
    ```

    - u/ketura:
      ```
      Hmm.  An Immediate Mode gui seems like it would be much more in line with what I'm used to for actual game development, but in my experience that is make-or-break based on the power of the library used.  This javascript project is intended to be a resurrection of the Bill's PC template creation utility, so it's basically a glorified form.  This sort of things *ought* to be something that the web knows how to do already, plus I'm attempting to give a good faith effort to actually *learn* web dev for once instead of just bitching about it from afar.  It may or may not work out, but I'm not willing to have *that* much control over how the GUI operates.

  I've started learning Python, from the book Automate the Boring Stuff with Python. Coming from learning C++ and some Java in college, it's an interesting experience. I don't particularly like the dynamic typing, and think the way of specifying which data structure to use through which braces you put is annoying (put parenthesis around your data to use a list, curly braces to make a dictionary, and I think square brackets to make a tuple?), but the ability to just *do things* is really nice without having to think much about implementing something efficiently. The modules system is also just hands down better than C++.  If there was some way to make Python statically typed, but change nothing else, that would be nice. 

  Note: I started less than a week ago. Any criticisms can and should be taken with a grain of salt.

    > Coming from learning C++ and some Java in college

    I'm so, so sorry. Your school has done you a disservice. Many schools are switching to using Python for their CS programs: Java isn't worth teaching (it is falling out of favor, and close enough to other C-like languages) and C++ is an "experts-only" language — that is, familiarity is required, but you won't be able to learn enough of it in college to say you know it.

    Python is a good language, though. Personally, I get annoyed that it doesn't support tail-call optimization or multi-line lambda expressions, but those are minor issues. One EE I know has almost entirely abandoned Matlab in favor of Python — all his co-workers have python distro's installed by default, so he doesn't need to jump through hoops to make something that works.

    > the way of specifying which data structure to use through which braces you put is annoying

    Instant access to the fundamental types is incredibly useful. Other languages are picking up on this way of doing things. Take C# for instance:

        new int[] {1,2,3,4,5}

    It's the same as Python's (1,2,3,4,5), but more verbose (since Python has dynamic typing the array type doesn't make sense).

    > I don't particularly like the dynamic typing

    Before judging dynamically typed systems too hashly, look into some languages with stronger typing systems than C++ and Java. Haskell, for instance (not very practical, but still worth spending the time to learn).

    In Python, what an object *is* can be very fluid. You can take an instance of an object, add/remove fields, redefine operators on the fly, and keep working with it. None of that is good practice, but it means an *object* is a peg that fits many different types of holes. Learning OOP from the perspective of C++/Java means you probably don't have the whole picture. Python takes a different approach, and ends up with a different set of benefits.

      I actually rather like C++ when I can get things working. It's not an easy language, but I think it's good at teaching how the computer works at a lower level, where Python seems to hide it. For learning computer science over learning programming, I don't think it's a bad choice, and it makes languages after that easier to understand.

      I'm not making any final judgements any time soon. I haven't even finished AtBSwP yet, and I'm aware that it isn't the best book for learning the Python language.

        That's an argument for learning/teaching ***C***, not C++.

        As far as learning *computational* science goes, simpler languages are better. Maybe Scheme, or Python. I recommend *[Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html)*.

        > when I can get things working

        ... that's the problem. Students should be learning theory, not struggling against the language. With C++, a simple const violation can lead to a cryptic compile-time error twenty lines long that no one can read. I'm of the opinion that first-year students need to be seeing results instead of errors, in order to get positive reinforcement.

  I'm officially done with finals. It's weird that I often end up way closer to the wire to get an A than you'd expect from chance. I think I end up moderating how much effort I put in to that goal which is probably less than ideal.

  In other news I need to decide what to do next now. I'm more and more feeling like I'm falling into the same kinds of mental traps video games use. Doing something because it feels productive even if it isn't. Should I still be going to school or should I seriously search for a job and find the best one I can now. I finished my CS degree, my thought was that for my ideal degree Biotech could only help and I have essentially free tuition, but I'm less and less sure of myself

    I've always thought gunning for scores beyond the ceiling of evaluation to be wasted effort, at least in classes that are not intrinsically interesting or useful or when you're not trying to impress the teacher (for e.g. letters of recommendation). It's good to overshoot a little bit -- to buffer against uncertainty in whatever your marks for the final evaluation might be -- but past that I see little point in trying to get a high score (unless you're shooting to be #1 at your school, but I'd think for that you might need to sacrifice taking a difficult (set of) major(s), since you'd be competing against people with less challenging coursework). Better to focus your energies on research or side projects or bettering yourself in other ways imo.

    I was always a bit chuffed at my own ability to skirt by at just above a given cutoff. Even managed to do it with Latin Honors, too (since you typically leave numeric GPA off your resume/CV once out of school, but would usually write out *summa cum laude* or whatever after you degree name). If the rewards for being the best are uniform across all the members of that set, it's best to be the worst of the best lol.

    Anyway, congrats on the A! And on being done with finals! Have a good winter holiday!

  Been thinking about religion.

  One of the things it seems to be actually useful for is support during hardships, especially loss of loved ones.   

  * It frames the situation in a positive light- they are in a better place and if there's a culprit then he'll burn in hell forever (especially when the earthly courts don't serve appropriate justice because reasons). Also their death wasn't meaningless roll of the dice, but part of a greater plan. Yes, it sounds horrible to most of you, but when one of your beliefs is "you don't know shit about God's plan or can even comprehend his ∞ IQ" then it's easier to use (also heaven is a thing, so they just got invited to party earlier).
  * Often provides social support. By this I mean both local community as well as religious services, stuff like confessions and blessings.

  So I guess my question is: atheists/non-theists of any kind- what do/did you do when tragedy like that hits you? Is there any comfort that is brought by science and rationality, be it practical or more mental/psychological/philosophical?  

  (Edit: True, I am pretty much referring to Christianity. Sadly I don't have enough experiences with other religions. If you do have such experience, then please tell if those arguments change in any significant way.)
  ```

  - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
    ```
    The goal of science and rationality isn't to make you feel better when tragedy hits, it is to make it less likely for tragedy to hit in the first place. 

    Being comforted by tragedy is a **bad** thing. You shouldn't be feeling happy when you lose loved ones. You shouldn't be thinking this is all part of a grand plan by an omnipotent benevolent being who will make everything right in the end. And you **definitely** should never think that this tragedy is beyond your ability to comprehend. To do so is to lose the motivation to actually do something about the tragedy. 

    When the non-theist sees death, they don't think "oh this is god's super super wise plan, let's not interfere with it lest we break it", they think "this is a meaningless dice roll, so let's work on loading those dice in our favor". And then they get to use science and rationality to figure out how to load those dice effectively.
    ```

    - u/Kishoto:
      ```
      While tragedy itself probably shouldn't comfort anyone, there's value in finding comfort in the midst of tragedy. Because tragedy (at least in this current stage of life and probably for the rest of our lives) is unavoidable. 

      It's all well and good to tout that we should be trying to beat death but, let's face reality, 99.99% percent of people aren't doing anything in their lives even remotely related to possibly beating death. Even if we're generous and include everyone working in the medical/pharmaceutical field, that still leaves a vast majority of people who are doing nothing to stave off death and probably never will. So why is it wrong for them to then seek comfort after what is (often times) a completely unavoidable tragedy?

      I do see where you're coming from here from a logical perspective; I just think your perspective is flawed and supremely over-idealistic. 

      EDIT: And it's also worth pointing out that even the most religious fanatics are usually quite fine with advances in medicine and other life extension options. Just because they believe it's God's plan doesn't mean they mind living longer, better lives (usually anyway)

        This is only if you define "beating death" as literally becoming immortal, and ignore everything else that helps prevent tragedy. Which is pretty unfair since there's tons of little things you can do to help prevent tragedies:

         * Wear a seat belt.
         * Ensure your city has good traffic laws.
         * Look left and right before crossing a street.
         * Learn medicine.
         * Exercise.
         * Eat healthy foods.
         * Go for medical check ups.
         * Vote for laws/politicians that promote safety.
         * Avoid dangerous actions.
         * Learn science about disasters to prevent them from happening, or at least get early warnings.
         * Prepare emergency supplies and emergency escape routes.
         * Get proper policing and firefighting services running in your area.
         * etc.
         * etc.

        The list just goes on and on and on. While sure, none of them guarantee you perfect immortality, it is better to do them than to just sit on your thumbs thinking that some benevolent omniscient god has everything already planned out for you. And the less happy you are about tragedy, the more motivated you will be to actually do something about it.

        Theists are hard to model because their beliefs tend to be contradictory. Or at least, have members with radically different beliefs that raise the same banner anyway. For example, when a tragedy happens, some priests say its "God's will", so just accept it and be happy that god is taking care of the dead, while others say its a "trial from god", or that "god only helps those who help themselves", so you have to work hard to overcome it or face god's wrath, which is not exactly comforting since you're apparently in some horrible trial with your eternal salvation/damnation at stake. Which is it?!

          Religious people still value their contemporary lives. They still wear seat belts, avoid addictions and in general lead healthy lives (as much as 'normal' people do, anyway). While there *are* extremes like you've mentioned, 'following God's plan' mostly just means making sure your actions are moral, with some consultation from scriptures/religious authorities.

          Religion's strength doesn't lie in it's logic. In fact, there's a fundamental disconnect between religion and science- (again an example from Christianity only) faith is valued higher than empirical evidence, as shown here- [John 20:29](http://biblehub.com/bsb/john/20.htm) *“Because you have seen Me, you have believed; blessed are those who have not seen, and yet have believed.”*.   
          Talking to an imaginary deity, going through all the rituals and gatherings and interpreting the holy books in a specific way... The purpose of all those practices is willful expansion of irrational beliefs. The beliefs people hold will contradict, because their personalities, subjective worldviews and needs differ, even if they stem from one 'culture' provided by a common pantheon.  
          'God loves you' isn't just an empty platitude there, but probably the most fundamental belief a practitioner may have. However terrible the trials, they are better than they could be, and even in most horrible situations God still has your back. Is it enough? With the right attitude, yes. 

          Religiosity is like any bias, instinct or emotion we as humans have- it distorts the correct vision of reality, but it still serves a practical purpose. Also, it's *there*, as you can't just cut it away, merely acknowledge and try to ignore/control it. And just like with the rest of those 'features', ignoring their influence or possible uses feels like a massive blindspot in rational outlook.

And the less happy you are about tragedy, the more motivated you will be to actually do something about it.

          While I do find this attitude good and admirable in general, it waves away the problem of actually facing the loss.  
          I don't mean loss as a death of a single family member, like a grandpa. I mean stuff like losing your wife and/or kids while your house burns down. A difference in implied severity here.  

          There's one problem especially- what happens when someone does *all* that, yet tragedy still strikes? When they try their hardest, and it isn't good enough? 
          What can that person *do*, besides carrying on like they used to? Won't their efforts be 'proven' (irrationally and not quite, but still) to be meaningless, since they failed to stop that from happening? 

          My questions boil down to: does science provide any tools or knowledge for managing internal mental state *during* the grieving process?  
          Assuming that a person *does* find comfort in religious practices when facing hardship, is there any pragmatic reason for them to believe in rationality instead?

          It may look like asking for a magical wand that solves all your problems, but- science already manages to master/manipulate all parts of the external environment. Does any of it extend into realm of the human mind however? Feels like it should have.

            Do they? It seems more like they do it just because that's just what seems normal to them, rather than do it as an attempt to prevent tragedies from happening. Their motivations seem very different, since to them tragedies aren't real. When people die, they go to eternal paradise, what's tragic about that? And if it isn't tragic, why would they try to prevent it? Where is the motivation here when their world views are so ludicrously happy?

            Yes, that's why I'm very confused by a lot of theists. When I point out the contradictions in their thoughts, they just wave their hands and say "God works in mysterious ways!" and think that justifies them not bothering to resolve these contradictions. It's doublethink gone wrong. I'm not trying to ignore it, I just can't comprehend it because of all the doublethink. Whatever random action they choose to do, there's somehow a religious explanation for it. And when you try to twist their logic back against them, to point out why their actions go against their own scriptures, they say "the devil can quote scripture for its own purposes!" or something and ignore it.

            >There's one problem especially- what happens when someone does all that, yet tragedy still strikes? When they try their hardest, and it isn't good enough? What can that person do, besides carrying on like they used to? Won't their efforts be 'proven' (irrationally and not quite, but still) to be meaningless, since they failed to stop that from happening?

            There's one thing you need to understand: rationality is not a cure-all. You can weight the dice so that they roll more often in your favor, but you can't glue them to the table so that they always have the same face up. The world we live in is harsh and unfair to the extreme, striking down the smartest and wisest while letting even the dumbest idiot survive and reproduce through sheer dumb luck. But to think "Oh well then, since I can't prevent tragedy 100%, why bother trying?" is just silly. No matter how much you prepare, you will eventually run into tragedies because of horrible dice rolls. But to just stop preparing because of that is to invite even more tragedy upon yourself.

            > Assuming that a person does find comfort in religious practices when facing hardship, is there any pragmatic reason for them to believe in rationality instead?

            The pragmatic reason is to reduce the frequency and intensity of future tragedies.

            Sorry. 

            Science actually has one major weakness: understanding humans. Not because humans are innately magical or anything, just that you can't perform proper scientific experiments on humans. All the major things, like dissections, or keeping them in cages (controlled environments) to control their lives and so avoid confounding variables, or sticking probes into their brains to see what happens, or cloning people to make better control groups, are all horrible ethical violations. Which means that scientists studying humans are generally restricted to case studies and surveys, which are horrible ineffective, or autopsying dead people. Who you know, are dead. Not exactly capable of thought patterns to analyze. 

            And while we can understand the purposes of most of our organs by studying animals with similar organs, no animal has brains similar to a human unless they are human. Or Neanderthal, but those are extinct and it would probably count as an ethics violation to experiment on them too.

            P.S. This is not to suggest that you should become a mad scientist and start human experimentation. Any benefit from that knowledge will be heavily overshadowed by the penalties of having the entire world out for your blood.

    Atheism tends to both require and result from a tendency towards accepting reality, even when it's not what you wanted. I mean, let's be real, it would be absolutely amazing if God had a plan and everything was going to work out, and everyone who dies goes to heaven, etc. Even just being able to truly believe that, whether or not it's true, would be a great help in reducing anxiety and stress.

    The problem is, very few Christians actually seem to truly believe any of it. Christians cry at funerals when they should be celebrating instead. Christians join the military and go off to kill people, potentially jeopardizing their place in heaven, or at least their relationship with God. For better or for worse, true belief seems to be a rarity among Christians. Unfortunately for them though, most people are better at understanding and accepting reality than they would like to be.

    Nonetheless, I think it's easily arguable that there *are* belief systems which are objectively superior to atheism for human functioning, whether or not they're true. For example, a genuine belief in a "divine plan" would certainly fit that definition as it would relieve anxiety and stress. Genuine belief in heaven is harder to argue for since it can reduce fear of death and cause risky or even risk-seeking behaviors. Even so, I think there are actually some variants of Christianity which could be described as objectively better than atheism for human functioning. Unfortunately, we humans are better at accepting reality than we might like, so atheists get stuck with facing the good and the bad for what they are whether they like it or not.

      Speaking as someone raised Christian for the first 17 years of his life (and then getting knocked straight into Agnosticism in his freshmen year of college), they usually have justifications for those things that (while oftentimes circular in their own way) allow them to continue on. For example, at funerals, most people will tell you that they are crying for themselves, not the person who died. And the pastor will often remark on how it's important to remember that that person (no matter how shitty or "un-Christian" they were, lol) is now with God and living blissfully. And for military service, Christians will often say that the "Thou shalt not kill" rule is absolute (and there's some evidence to suggest that's true) and things like wartime and self defense are usually exceptions. 

      And I do agree that there are certainly belief systems that are objectively superior to atheism for human functioning, regardless of their veracity.

    I've long seen the value in religion in exactly the context you're speaking about. It serves as a beacon of hope and a moral center for people who allow themselves to buy into it. Even the most vitriolic atheists among us can probably agree that they would prefer their loved ones going to a benevolent eternal afterlife as opposed to the lack of existence that we feel is one of the more likely outcomes of death. 

    I've honestly had moments where I wished I could delude myself enough to buy into a religion (most probably Christianity since that's what I was raised in) because I can see the emotional comfort and strength it gives so many; the idea of God allows people to have a capacity for love, forgiveness and hope that is, while not impossible, very *very* unlikely in shitty situations.
