  It seems to be full grimdark, parody weapons treated seriously and setting twisted to make torture a reasonable solution.

  Overall standard, unreadable 40k tripe.

  I couldn't get past the poor writing quality of the first few chapters. Missing punctuation and run-on sentences made it difficult to parse in places, and something of a chore.

  I've been torn between recommending this because the Dark Age of Technology faction makes many rational fic style decisions and because the idea of a faction of DAOT survivors encountering the 40k universe is super interesting, and disliking it due to 100k words of extreme grimdarkness and unending war against chaos. 

  The story is still updating and has recently reached the "current" 40k universe.

    I'm okay with a certain amount of grimdark, but is there a lot of "Bad things happening when they don't make sense, because GRIMDARK"?
    ```

      The budding Dark Eldar completely failing to give a shit about anyone else but themselves is a pretty sensible reason for GRIMDARK.

      >The sun had gone. The Eldar masters of the Galaxy using the ancient construction of the Old Ones had removed the star to be placed in their webway. Providing light to the great port city of Commoragh the nexus of the labyrinth dimension that granted them swift and easy traversal of the Galaxy. Without the suns warmth or the grip of gravity the planet spun out of control through the void. Descending into a winter that ended only when the remnants of the atmosphere itself froze over. Whether the eldar had bothered noticing the planet was inhabited or just hadnâ€™t cared was a mystery and completely irrelevant to the poor creatures who had spent their last moments huddled around fires lit by their own burning libraries.

      There is more of that than I'd like. That said, it is less that the bad things don't make sense, because the actions always make sense to the characters in context for a greater good of some sort, but the mechanics/rules of the universe are designed to be a bit sadistic. 

      My specific issue was with the use of torture to turn demons back into people. Why choose that in particular as the way to do it? The author comments about this being justified by the results but it is justified because the author decided this is how the setting works.

      To be fair to the author, the actual warhammer 40k setting has tons of this too, where the only way to accomplish things is by being awful on a massive scale. For example the emperor's throne/ the astronomicon basically eating psykers as sacrifices to keep him alive, and a massive inquisition that purges "heresy", new technologies, and free thought being the primary defense against chaos, and the DAOT faction ends up looking good in comparison.

        Well, this *is* a setting that started out as a parody of grimdarkness. Still that's hardly an excuse for fanfic authors to keep it going. I saw this a while ago and dropped it early because I wasn't sure I liked where it was going- it seemed that the DaoT humans were going to be  the standard mary sue op humans that beat up the aliens who have done X to make the audience angry (the transcendent humanity formula, stars I hate that fic)- but if that's not the case I might pick it up again.

          WH40K started out as a parody? A parody of what?
          ```

          - u/None:
            ```
            Less a parody or satire, and more just as the dry British humor of intentionally over-the-top darkness and horror.  There were once winks and nods like Space Marines disco dancing, but they've walked a lot of those back.
            ```

          - u/EthanCC:
            ```
            I've heard Rogue Trader started out as a parody of edginess and grimdarkness in media before they started taking it seriously around 40k 2nd edition or so (and ironically ended up coining "grimdark" by accident). Can't find the link, unfortunately, so I may be misremembering it.
