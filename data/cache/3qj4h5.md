  Clearly if running around in circles isn't solving your problems then you just aren't running fast enough.

    Hey, it worked for Superman.
    ```

      Yeah, but that made some sense.  He went FTL and traveled back in time.  This is just weird.
      ```

- u/MugaSofer:

  I've figured out how *The Flash* works: the faster he goes, the stupider he gets.

  Hence why he's marginally competent at the beginning, and by the time he can go FTL he's been reduced to running in circles very fast and hoping it fixes everything because he ran at *just* the right fix-everything speed somehow.

  After I finished watching and parodying SG-1 and Atlantis, I started in on Supernatural.  I've been taking a break from that for a few weeks to focus on writing, but tonight I noticed that season 2 of The Flash had started up.  I had to go back and re-watch the season 1 finale in order to have context; it was stupider than I remembered, so I decided to write it up.

  Is this based on DC or something? Seems very silly. If one plans to involve technobabble, I'd at least try to make it follow esetoric rules explaining why it can do x when our current understanding of the world says x is impossible.
  ```

  - u/eaglejarl:
    ```
    Yeah, Flash is a DC character.  The show is fun, but definitely on the goofy side of the physics scale.
    ```

- u/ZeroNihilist:
  ```
  Tune in next time for the adventures of Barry Allen in *Don't Worry, I Can Run Even Faster You Guys: The Barry Allen Story*.
