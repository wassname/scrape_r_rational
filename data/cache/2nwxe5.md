## End of RaNaNoWriMo

### Post:

Since RaNaNoWriMo has now ended, does any of the writers who worked on a story for it want to mention what they did? It doesn't have to be an actual link to a full story. Just a summary and how much of it you managed to write as well as any future plans concerning it would be greatly appreciated.

  I limped across the finish line tonight. The story itself is nowhere near done, but I think I wrote some things that are worth keeping, and came to some useful realizations about what needs to be done with the story (she's going to find her mother, how did I not see that before!) - which is about what I'd hoped to get out of NaNo. I think that now that the month is over, I'm going to do some editing (to make the story conform to what it should have been) and then continue on. Writing characters helps you learn about those characters and who they are, which is part of the reason that long-running series have early installment weirdness. With some of that out of the way, I can rewrite the start so that everything is consistent.

  It's at least nice to know that I wrote 50,000 words this month, which is above my average.

    Will you continue to publish your drafts on fictionpress? I've really enjoyed reading what you wrote their and it's been interesting.

    If you sell this story as ebook later, I'll definitely buy it :-)

      I think my current plan is to take everything down and then work on fixing all the things I know are wrong, then put it all back up later, or alternately, sell it. I do like posting drafts, but writing with continuous forward motion (like I do for NaNo) is sort of unnatural because I have flashes of insight and need to go back and change things - which I tend to do right when the problem/solution occurs to me. If writing tended to be a more linear process I would put up the draft chapters the whole way though, but there's no easy way to do it when you're hopping around a lot.

      (Thanks for reading, by the way!)

        That makes sense. By the way, definitely sell it. You're talented and I'm sure a lot of people here would gladly buy one of your books.

        That said, one thing I'd definitely pay for is something like a patreon where a writer I like works on a book and shows all of the drafts as they progress. It wouldn't matter if the chapters are published in order or if things are rewritten due to flash of insight since the whole point would be to see the creation process. Being a programmer, I'd suggest using git for that :-)

    Congratulations. (Sincere, not sarcastic.)

    That's 100 times what I write.

  First off - I am not going to even look at my story again until January.

  Even though most of what I wrote is probably going to be rewritten completely, the information and character familiarity I got from writing it in the first place is going to be immensely useful. I wrote everything in first person, and switched between ~7 characters. The rewrite is going to be in third person, but getting inside the characters' heads makes them much more fleshed out, even when they're not even going to be a POV character. Every character, whether you're focused on them or not, should be a fully realized individual with quirks of the personality, and the main character of their own story.

  Also, voluminous amounts of worldbuilding and ironing-out of the magic system was accomplished as well. All in all, a very productive month.

  ```
  I started strong and then stopped. I kept missing days due to school work and house work and the like(and once a lack of power) and the catch up piled on, so I gave up.

  I think I got to a measly 10K words. It is the most I've written in such a small span, so I know I'm capable of doing it. I just lacked direction, and time.
