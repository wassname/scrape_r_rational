  A central part of being an Inquisitor is a blind, unshakeable *faith* though...

  That's quite the feature set! I would love to play it one day. Since you're taking suggestions though, I'll add that a conversation feature that requires players to identify and/or refute common logical fallacies (perhaps from their superiors) would be really neat. That could be a whole game unto itself though.

  [edit, I re-read your post and noticed that you're looking for comments on your current planned features, so I'll amend this to say that the "Orders from Superiors" section would be a great place to encourage rational thinking! A system similar to, or expanding on, the close reading of passport descriptions from "Papers, Please" would be really interesting.]

    Okay, I like this. I could allow the AI behind both minions (who help your analyses and investigations) and superiors (who give you orders) to make faulty conclusions depending on their stats, and reveal the mistake when justifying decisions. It'd be up to players to decide the following:

    * What confidence to assign a theory
    * Whether to follow a plan
    * Whether to correct a mistake (can train mental stats)
    * How to justify not obeying orders (can train superior's stats or influence likelihood of punishment)

    I really want to avoid breaking immersion, though.

  My only suggestion would be making it playable for people (like me) who have never read/played/etc. anything to do with 40k.

  Holy Moses, that's ambitious! I think my most desired feature would be actual existence, so... maybe a greatly reduced feature set for the initial launch? Dwarven Fortress has been the result of years of continual building, it started out much smaller than it is right now.
  ```

- u/chaosmosis:
  ```
  Modular text inputs that can be easily understood and used, rather than ad hoc inputs often seen in text games.
  ```

  - u/seylerius:
    ```
    Hell yes. Not going the MUD or text adventure route. Options, menus, and the ability to build conversational interactions from parts.
    ```
