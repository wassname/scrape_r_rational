  See the characteristics further up on the sidebar.

  Alternatively:  Rational fiction holds that no character or group thereof may be given an Idiot Ball or a The-Plot-Demands-It Ball.  Rationalist fiction additionally encourages its readers to think rationally.  These principles generate the rules on the sidebar.

  That info is also on the side bar? Unless you want to start a discussion on how the terms rational and rationalist fiction may have shifted since the creation of the community.
