## [D] Friday Open Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.

  Okay, now I'm curious, AutoModerator.

  What *are* the sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league?

    Mysterious. I assume he's not out as anything or there would be some discussion online but there's also no mention of him having a wife. Unsurprisingly there's not a ton of media coverage about the guy.

  I accidentally fueled an existential crisis in a friend of mine last night. I thought we were having an engaging and thoughtful philosophical discussion until she started to repeatedly ask how she knew I was real; being completely serious and increasingly worried.

  Has anyone else had an experience like this? What happened after?

    Everyone eventually seems to come to some variant of the conclusion that they lose nothing by assuming they're real, but potentially lose everything if they assume they're not.

    Yes, had a very similar experience. It turned out alright after coming down from the shrooms.

    Its a thing we also see with certain other mental hazards (rokos basilik etc). Mostly hits people who are prone to anxiety anyway, its more a symptom of anxiety than anything else. For most people it goes away after a while but a small number of people are affect *heavily* for months.

  What media do you like consume when youre sad?

   i like the harry potter audiobooks read by jim dale.

    Consuming media often doesn't actually help deal with the reason for being sad, it only pushes it out of my mind for a bit. What has helped me much more was usually talking to people, whether in real life or on the internet.

    That said, for pushing sad thoughts from my mind I like violent games like DOOM, or complex games like Into The Breach.

    ```
    In cases where I am sad over the death of someone, I usually end up reading something transhumanist. Dresden Codsk, HPMOR, some of the humanist speeches.
    ```
