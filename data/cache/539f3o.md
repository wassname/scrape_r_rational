  Glad to see this updating, and it's nice to see things from Danzo's perspective. No one is a villain in their own story, and his take on things is frighteningly plausible. Almost certainly wrong, but plausible.

    Hey eaglejarl, you were the one writing the "Naruto is on Team Anko instead of Team Kakashi" fic, right? (if not, please ignore the rest of this comment)

    If so, I was one of your early readers and I think I gave you some feedback on the first few chapters, but unfortunately I got so busy around that time I had to drop most of the web serials I was reading, yours included. I was thinking about trying to find it again recently, but was at a complete loss as to how to go about doing so until I recognized your username. What ever happened to the fic? Still updating?

    Yep. People are scarily convincing when they truly believe what they say.

    I really wanted to make it believable, even if I disagree with the man I think he should still have a realistic thought process that got him to where he is. Danzo is what happens when a person keeps seeing themself as a hero because they think that's an intrinsic part of themself, rather than a label that is given and taken away based on their actions.

  This looks interesting and I'm thinking about picking this story up. Can anyone give me a super short review or recommendation for it?

  Also, it seems my jargon knowledge is lacking. What's an "SI" in this context?

  > What happens when a SI gets reborn in the world of Naruto

  Self-Insert? Super Intelligence?

    Self Insert, yep.

    Sure thing, here's my biased view on it. Person with rather limited knowledge of Naruto and engineering knowledge ends up in the Naruto world in the brain of baby. Orphaned, and feeling like a prime target for Root 'recruitment', the SI attempts to grow strong enough to avert the coming possible end of the world whilst not being noticed as strong enough to be kidnapped and also giving targeted information to improve the odds of the world not ending, and also ideally improving his own standing. I take the butterfly effect rather seriously to the point that no-one conceived after the SI's introduction has the same genetics and has no guarantee to be the same gender, or even to exist in the first place, because sperm are highly random. 

    The focus of the story is on worldbuilding the world of Naruto to make some sort of sense, munchkining the hell out of limited resources, some comedic elements, friendships and high speed combat.

      Well, I'm sold. Thanks. Officially added to my backlog. The Naruto universe is, IMO, just as rich a setting as the HarryPotterverse, so I'm looking forward to seeing it [de/re]constructed.

      Any rough idea how far along is the story is, %-wise?
      ```

        ```
        I couldn't really say for sure. Probably less than half way through the entire story. But I'm trying to make the first half into its own self-contained story and that bit is say 70% done.
        ```
