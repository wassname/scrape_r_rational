## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  I think that *Mission Impossible: Fallout* was maybe the most anti-utilitarian film I've ever seen.

  Mild spoilers for things that were in [the trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wb49-oV0F78), from what's essentially the prologue section of the film, prior to the first act. Alec Baldwin says "You had a terrible choice to make in Berlin, one life over millions, and now the world is at risk." This is followed by the CIA woman saying "If he had followed the mission, we wouldn't be having this conversation." Baldwin replies, "His team would be dead," to which the CIA woman replies, "Yes, they would, that's the job."

  This is entirely sensible, if unheroic (at least in the classical sense of heroism). Most of the plot of the movie follows from >!Ethan choosing to save a lifelong friend rather than actually doing his job,!< and, as typical in a Mission Impossible movie, the world comes within a few lucky coincidences and millimeter precise moments of ... well, not necessarily *destruction*, but certainly megadeaths.

  Where other movies might choose to make this message implicit, MI:Fallout chooses to hammer it home a number of times through dialog, repeating the refrain that actually, having a severe case of scope insensitivity is a *good* quality in people who routinely have to deal with wild imbalances of scope.

  I thought it was a great movie, but the fact that they kept trying to loudly proclaim that it's virtuous to neglect scope was a little bit jarring, given both my values and to some extent, the plot of the film.

    I think Hollywood, and other forms of entertainment media, have become more and more uncomfortable with the costs of winning at all costs. The simple narrative of a world at hair-trigger risk is an extremely convenient tool for increasing tension, *and* an extremely convenient tool for political overreach.

    Filmmakers and show-runners and comics authors are concerned that heroes who run around killing people today will be unsympathetic in a way that they weren't in the 1980's. So something is added to the text to assure the audience that they're good people: one is kind to animals, another loves his wife or children, another makes hard choices protecting the innocent when there are dangers.

    The bleakest example from MI:F wasn't its inciting incident, it was Ethan fatally shooting >!four gang members in order to save the French police officer who saw the team stashing their prisoner.!< The movie only introduced, and killed, those characters in order to save the protagonist from a dilemma! >!They shoot her for him, functionally disarming her, and the fact that he kills in order to save her gains her trust. I'm even sure the movie chose to have her be a woman in order to make her seem especially vulnerable and innocent. Imagine the same scene with a character played by, say, Henry Cavill.!< It's lazy writing at the expense of potential character development. If you don't let Ethan learn the consequences of this sort of hard decision, he's going to find himself making this same mistakes over and over again.

    Good for the movie series, I'm sure, but not so good for the making the sense.

    A story could also concentrate on the hard decisions that "bad guys" had to make that put them in a situation where many of their deaths are, so far as this movie is concerned, worth saving one life. How many deaths are Ethan and Friends responsible for compared to any given disposable thug?

    So the film is trying *really hard* not to have us think about that sort of thing. ETHAN IS A GOOD GUY, it shouts over and over. I agree this has rather the opposite of the desired effect.

      Funny enough, [the original script was much more ambivalent about Hunt being a good guy](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/mission-impossible-tom-cruise-pushed-a-dark-plot-was-cut-1130744):

      > Case in point: McQuarrie and Cruise conceived of a plot that would have seen hero Ethan Hunt >!assume the identity of extremist John Lark for an even longer chunk of the film,!< a move that would have taken the IMF agent down some dark roads in pursuit of his goal and would have forced him to do some "horrible things," notes McQuarrie. The expanded plot was eventually scrapped, as the director felt it made the film too intellectual and robbed it of the trademarks that people expect from a Mission: Impossible movie.

      (The interview has some discussion from the director about a "dark" Ethan that I found fairly interesting.)

    It would be darkly funny to make a fan edit of the movie that occasionally cuts to all the death and misery caused by the protagonist saving his friends at the expense of everyone else, just to undercut that message. Whenever the protagonist makes a point about how it was right to save his team, play 10 minutes of footage of funerals and the weeping parents/children/spouses for all the people who died when everything turned out "well". Not having seen the movie, I'm guessing a number of the good guys die, even if the day is saved in the end? And that number of preventable deaths was greater than the number of people on the protagonist's team?

    The boss lady was pretty much the only character whose actions weren’t powered by kindergarten logic. Though by the end of the movie she got brainwashed as well, I suppose.

    It sounds to me like you've critically misunderstood. It *is* moral to care about the individuals as much as the aggregates. If you care more about millions of people you've never met than about the few people you can see with your own eyes, you may have a moral failing. Such "scope sensitivity" opens you up to being manipulated by hearsay and conspiracy.

    Here's a puzzle for you: Would you give up your life in exchange for the lives of a million strangers you've never met? This is, presumably, the moral thing to do. The real question is what evidence would you require first?

    > I thought it was a great movie

    It was sufficiently enjoyable, but I wouldn't recommend spending theater money to see it.

  So I finished the first book of the Mars Trilogy by Kim Stanley Robinson, Red Mars, and I think it would fit this sub's tastes even if I wouldn't necessarily call it rational. Hard sci-fi, dealing with the colonization and terraformi g of Mars, and all the ethical concerns raised by those actions. Kind of like the Foundation novels, but I can't put my finger on precisely why. Anyways, it's enjoyable, and I recommend it.

  I still plan on talking about what I've learned about the art of memory, from Moonwalking with Einstein and a few other books, but I was indisposed on Monday for the general rationality thread and didn't want to post a comment that I put effort into if no one was going to see it. I also still need to out some time into practicing the techniques, but that isn't much of a priority right now.

  A nice variant on the Shadow Clone: [Kaizou Kage Bunshin (login required)!](https://forum.questionablequesting.com/posts/720578) In order to prevent chakra poisons and memetic hazards from being transmitted to the original, the copy *doesn't* return its chakra and memories to its creator when it's dispelled. Immediately after being created, it knows that it has been doomed to an imminent death. (I get the feeling that it needs a more specific name, though, since `kaizou` apparently ([1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizo_Mario_World) [2](https://translate.google.com/#ja/en/%E6%94%B9%E9%80%A0)) means merely `modified`. u/subrosian_smithy)

  Fanfiction idea: A ninja who knows a technique that absorbs chakra from other people learns this technique and uses it&mdash;or, alternatively, a clone that was created with this technique by a poorly-disciplined ninja and then went rogue stumbles across a chakra-absorption technique. Now, roaming the Elemental Nations is a clan of chakra-vampire clones who must steal chakra from others to avoid dying. The story ends when they learn Sage Mode and become able to absorb chakra from plants and mundane animals rather than having to go after humans and summon animals&mdash;or when they've multiplied to such an extent that all human life has been extinguished and the summon animals have retreated to their homes (which are either across the ocean from the Elemental Nations or on a separate plane of existence from Earth, depending on the author).

  Optional twist: The original is dead, and only his clones are still around. Maybe clones even are *immortal* as long as they have enough chakra to continually Henge their malleable pseudo-bodies into younger forms&mdash;or, maybe, without specific souls to "remind" them of their proper forms, they gradually lose definition and deform into monstrosities, Glory Girl-style, if they attempt to prolong their lifespans.

  See also the traditionally-published book [*Kiln People*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40600413). The book revolves around disposable clones, of varying lifespans and qualities, whose memories are uploaded back to their originals only if the clones return to base before running out of the ["&eacute;lan vital"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89lan_vital) that was used to create them. IIRC (I haven't read this book in *many* years&mdash;though [Goodreads Deals](https://www.goodreads.com/deals/about) recently facilitated my snagging a copy for $2, so I'll get around to reading it again soon enough) >!the ultimate villain of the story is a clone whose original discovered the secret of infusing &eacute;lan vital into *existing* clones (which normally isn't possible) in order to make those clones immortal. The clone, being high-quality enough to impersonate his original (most clones are cheap and unconvincing), killed the original and made himself immortal!<.

  It's interesting to note how different authors treat [the Shadow Clone Technique](http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Shadow_Clone_Technique) differently. The default assumption is that, when a Shadow Clone is dispelled, its memories (along with some of any leftover chakra&mdash;or not, because the connection is purely soul-based, not chakra-based\*) are transmitted back to its creator. Some authors, however, allow those memories to be transmitted, not only to the original, but also to *all* the original's *other* Shadow Clones! This alternative interpretation allows for such overpowered tactics as quickly creating and dispelling a Shadow Clone in order to transmit newly-learned information to your entire network in the blink of an eye, and thereby gets rid of the "the right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing" situations that independently-operating Shadow Clones otherwise inevitably must confront if left to their own devices for long periods. On the other hand, however, some authors decree that any genjutsu that affects a Shadow Clone can *propagate* (with some extra effort on the part of the genjutsu user&mdash;or not, because of self-amplifying soul-resonance effects&mdash;and only after the directly-affected clone has been dispelled&mdash;or not, because the genjutsu user can sense the thread of the clone connection and follow it back to its source in the course of casting the technique) to the creator&mdash;or, under the alternative interpretation that I just described, to the creator *and* to his other Shadow Clones, which largely offsets the overpoweredness of that version of the technique (because, the more clones you have out, the more likely it is that an enemy will catch *one* of those clones in a sleep genjutsu and render you and your one-man army totally defenseless in a single stroke).

  I haven't read much *Naruto* fanfiction in a while,\*\* so the only relevant story that I can add to this pile of (You) bait (other than the one that I already linked) is [*Indomitable*](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5207262).

  \*If chakra *is* transmitted, however, enemies may be able to [triangulate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangulation_\(surveying\)) the original's position by dispelling several of his clones and using sensory techniques to watch where the clones' chakra goes.

  \*\**Inter alia*, I was reading [the d'Artagnan Romances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_d%27Artagnan_Romances). My fifth reading of [*The Three Musketeers*](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1257) was as good as I remembered, and my second reading of [*Twenty Years After*](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1259) was significantly *better* than I remembered&mdash;but I had to throw in the towel approximately 40&nbsp;% of the way into my second reading of *The Vicomte de Bragelonne* (halfway through [Volume 2 of 4](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2681)) because it was just *too* boring and I wasn't willing to skip as much as I did on my first reading. *Ventre-saint-gris!* Maybe I'll finally get around to experiencing [*Time Braid*](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644) for the seventh time after reading [*The First Fifteen Lives of Harry August*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35066358) (thanks, Goodreads Deals!)&hellip; but what about [*Les Mis&eacute;rables*](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/135)?

    If I was writing that today, yeah, I would go out of my way to give it a more specific name -- either getting input from a friend who knows Japanese, or (much more likely) just giving all technique names and such in English. I would also publish it elsewhere, where logins aren't required (and deleting posted fanfiction is actually possible without contacting moderators for support, lol). I anticipated getting much farther in that story than I actually did, but that's what writing is like.

    Les Mis is pretty damn good, IMHO. It's a pain to find a good translation, though -- there's French wordplay flying left and right like Victor Hugo was competing with Aaron Smith-Teller.

  I finally binged through Attack on Titan season 2 the other day, in preparation for the third season. I'm really glad I did: it's a little more rough around the edges than season one was, but makes up for it in sheer audacity and fun factor. I wouldn't call Attack on Titan as a whole "rational" - the main character is dumb as a sack of potatoes - but I do love how the Isayama writes his mysteries. Everything was written with the intention of having an answer, rather than the answers being filled in after the fact.
  *****    
  I've gotten better at exercising discretion over what I read. It bugs me how many hundred-thousand-word stories I drop instantly because the author did something unforgivably stupid. Like, there are scenarios where I'll stick it out - generally when there's something else interesting going on - but for the most part a lot of authors have a hard time holding my attention. In Naruto fanfiction it's usually poor characterization or overuse of cliches (Sasuke bashing, "dobe", Kakashi is an irresponsible teacher, any number of fandom specific plots, *unnecessary or indiscriminate japanese*). In Harry Potter fanfiction "independent" or "backbone" is usually the trigger phrase. Keep in mind I'm not even counting the hundreds of fics I skip based on title and summary alone. The problem isn't that the people writing these things are necessarily bad authors. In fact, in many cases, they might actually be pretty decent, or at least technically competent. It's that they weren't able to spare the additional two motes of brain power required to eliminate the most obvious flaws in their work. Half the reason I like rational fiction is because no author who executes rational fiction correctly could possibly be inattentive enough to make something that hideous. (in theory)

  (Bashing is another one - if a character is so inexplicably evil that the protagonist wonders out loud how they could have come to be that way, I drop it. I once received a great piece of advice about writing from a teacher of mine, that went something like: "If your writing is so unrealistic that your characters feel the need to *voice aloud* how unbelievable it is, you should be careful. Make sure your characters never have an opinion about your writing, let alone a correct one.")
  ****
  I should save *something* for the recommendation thread, but I haven't read/watched anything really rational in the last few days, so I might as well post them here. Everything here is not necessarily equal, but they all passed the test of not being awful enough for me to drop them. In order of when I read them, from latest to earliest:

  * [Fate/Reach Out](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/fate-reach-out-f-sn-smt-p4-crossover-story-thread.245101/) is a pretty dumb crossover of Fate/Stay Night and Persona 4. Pretty much submersed in Fate fanon, but it's not poorly written and gets the point of Persona. I really liked the dynamic between Shirou's typical martyrdom complex and Persona's whole "power of friendship" thing coming into conflict, and that was really the only thing I wanted from this crossover.

  * [Man off the Moon](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/man-off-the-moon-fate-extra-x-mass-effect.641011/) is similar, except with Fate/Extra and Mass Effect. It's *alright*. Kind of boring prose-wise, and it doesn't get much of anywhere fast, but the author has a ridiculous update rate, and anything in these two fandoms that isn't shipper garbage is something to be cherished.

  * Went through the first two seasons of Overlord the other day, and I wasn't expecting to like it as much as I did from the outset. I think that the main character's "emotional control" thing does wonders to stop the story from becoming yet another "trapped in another world to seduce girls" thing. The focus on the extended cast rather than the Overlord himself makes the story seem much more tense, something I'm really glad for.

  * [Prytaneum](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/danmachi-percy-jackson-prytaneum.352191/), a crossover between Danmachi and Percy Jackson by Ryuugi. When it's not rehashing Danmachi canon, I'm really impressed by its dedication to worldbuilding, and by this weird ontological mystery caused purely by Percy's presence. Has the typical Ryuugi flaw of dropping the main story for a long drawn out series of mostly inconsequential fights for a while, which makes this a softer recommendation. It's not quite as hilariously drawn out as *The Games We Play*, which got fucking inane towards the middle.

  I can't remember very much before that, last month. If anyone knows any medium long-fics that are either complete or still updating, along these same lines of quality, I'd love to hear your recommendations as well. This is strictly talking about non-rational fiction - you can trust that I have my eyes glued to the subreddit. Crossovers are fun, but only if they pay out in the end.

    > *unnecessary or indiscriminate japanese*

    Oh that bugs me a lot as well. I've mostly stopped reading new fanfiction, because I feared that my tastes were regressing, but when I was into Naruto fiction the random Japanese was just so jarring. So many of the terms they use Japanese for have perfectly good English translations. I do not need nor want to remember the Japanese names for all the elemental nations, nor the named attacks. It's not like I'm missing some cultural phrase or something by only knowing the English names; it's just confusing. It comes off as the author being an anime snob who gets really heated about subs vs. dubs debates.

      It's not necessarily the villages or titles that I really care about, it's the inconsistency. If you are going to use "sandaime hokage" do not suddenly switch to "third hokage" whenever the hell it suits you, for instance. And with technique names, it's fine so long as the actual description of the technique is accompanied by the name, and it's consistent. It'd be weird if a story about ninjas *didn't* have a lot of Japanese loan words. The problem is when those words don't really mean anything in Japanese either, or are irrelevant. I don't need to hear "konohagakure no sato" when you're just going to switch to Konoha in a few phrases anyway. I don't need to hear honorifics if you're going to be inconsistent about them, or you are unaware of the distinction between given and family names. Or if the author isn't educated enough to know what the Japanese they're throwing in means. I can't tell you how many stories I've dropped because they say something like "the village of the village hidden in the leaves" or something else that stupid.

  So could the [2017 Beauty and the Beast remake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beauty_and_the_Beast_(2017_film\)) be considered (bad?) "rational fanfiction"? I saw [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpUx9DnQUkA) a few days ago and felt that a lot of what its author didn't like about the remake would also hold true for many of the fanfics posted on this sub (e.g. fixing plot holes and inconsistencies at the expense of the original characterization). I also didn't quite agree with a fair bit of what she'd said (e.g. the Beast letting Belle go doesn't condemn the house to death, because keeping her an unwilling prisoner isn't likely to earn her love enough to satisfy the conditions of the curse). But overall have generally found her videos entertaining and thought-provoking.

  I also think some of the things the remake "fixed" that she criticizes *were* improvements to the 1991 Disney film (from what I recall of it, having not seen it in ages), e.g. if Prince Adam's primary failing at 11 was not letting a scary stranger into his house, then a decade-long curse ending in his death seems unjustified, especially since in actuality the powerful enchantress would have been *totally* unharmed by a bit of foul weather and was totally willing to screw the Prince over with moral entrapment -- talk about stranger danger!). I think that casts the entire plot in a rather different light, and seems less nitpicky than a lot of her criticisms of the remake, as well as less answerable by the MST3K mantra (“If you’re wondering how he eats and breathes and other science facts, then repeat to yourself ‘It’s just a show, I should really just relax.’”). But I can still imagine stuff like that not bothering others as much.

  (edit: to clarify, I did agree with many of her points)
  ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    (I love Lindsay Ellis.)

    I think a lot of what she talks about in that video applies more generally to ["fix fics"](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FixFic), of which rational fanfic is commonly a subset. But in the specific example of Beauty and the Beast, a lot of the fixes that they made didn't actually need to be made, and in fact, make the work *less* like rational fiction. In particular, Belle creating a washing machine that she's mocked for and Belle being chastised for reading when that's mostly ahistoric, the villagers being paid to sing Gaston's praises, Belle's mother having a tragic backstory that her father never explains to her ... a lot of them make the work make *less* sense, not more, and they're not justifications for what happens in the original plot, they're things added on to answer criticisms of the original.

    That said, yes, a lot of "bad" rational fanfic does those things too, and even some of the "good" rational fanfic will -- how to put this -- not necessarily fix things at the expense of the original characterization, but *explore* things at the expense of that characterization, especially in terms of pointing out ethical or moral problems, knock-on effects of character decisions, etc. I might feel that the Beauty and the Beast remake was a better movie if I thought that it was attempting a deconstruction of the original, but I really don't think that the remake was doing that, it was just trying to put its own spin on things. (My read on Lindsay Ellis is that she wouldn't have a problem with a deconstructionist take on something, but I might be wrong.)
