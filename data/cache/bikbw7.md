  ```
  So since Hanno has surrendered his decision-making to the heavenly magic 8-ball that is the Choir of Judgement, Kairos is really setting up for Hierarch to try Judgement by proxy. I REALLY don't see that going well for Above.
  ```

  - u/Mbnewman19:
    ```
    Ooh good call. As mentioned before, the Gods have one vote in Bellapheron, and therefore can be judged.
    ```

    - u/GlimmervoidG:
      ```
      Only the Gods Bellow have a vote in Bellapheron. I don't think it has been confirmed the Gods Above are considered citizens anywhere in the league.

      Having said that, Bellapheron will have no problem judging foreign tyrants, divine or otherwise.
      ```

      - u/panchoadrenalina:
        ```
        the book of all things (nailed to a chair) is a member of the leading council of the league, if you squint a little you can imagine as the gods above having a say in the decisions of the league and thus, also being a member.
        ```

        - u/Mbnewman19:
          ```
          Nice call. Well spotted.
          ```

        - u/Allian42:
          ```
          ...Did the Tyrant put that book there for this reason? If so, god dammit Kairos.
          ```

- u/Nimelennar:
  ```
  >In the interests of diplomacy, I refrained from mentioning I figured if any Choir was going to be in favour of infant-smothering it’d be Mercy.

  Is Cat familiar with Tariq's backstory, or is that just a coincidentally accurate observation?
  ```

  - u/ATRDCI:
    ```
    No presumably just familiarity with Mercy in general.
    ```

- u/thebishop8:
  ```
  "Principle without ambition is mediocrity."

  That second part of the page quote brings rationality to mind.

    ```
    I know, I loved it
    ```

- u/Rice_22:
  ```
  Have to say, I do enjoy Catherine outplaying the Tyrant & the Heroes and her new magnificent bastard shtick. A mastery of words and information is always way more powerful than swords or ice powers.

  Pretty sure things aren't going to go just as planned forever, though.
  ```

- u/Arganthonius:
  ```
  What crimes has Catherine even committed in the eyes of Saint and Pilgrim, aside from being branded "Evil" by the Heavens? I can't really think of anything a reasonable person would take offense to.
  ```

  - u/Nimelennar:
    ```
    Um.  Murder, truce-breaking, soul desecration, swearing allegiance to the Gods Below, turning an entire realm's story towards villainy, more murder, swearing allegiance to the Dread Empress of Praes, accessory to dark apotheosis, still more murder, and jaywalking.
    ```

    - u/Trezzie:
      ```
      Okay but besides that.
      ```

      - u/Nimelennar:
        ```
        Overzealous use of snappy retorts?
        ```

    - u/Arganthonius:
      ```
      She never committed murder (she's only ever killed in self-defense or as punishment for a suitable crime) or swore allegiance to the Gods Below, turning an entire realm's story towards villainy is abstract and counts as being branded "evil". She broke her allegiance to the Empress the moment she could feasibly do so and only ever swore it in the first place to free her country. She also never broke a truce, and the Pilgrim shouldn't know that she was involved in Sve Noc's Apotheosis, which is dark because, again, the Heavens said so. The soul desecration is fair, though.
      ```

      - u/tavitavarus:
        ```
        Catherine never murdered anyone?

        That's a... bold position to take.

        How about the Praesi noble whose soul she ripped out out at the end of Book 2, purely to make a point? And he wasn't a mage, so he had no part in summoning anything. He just happened to be on the wrong side.

        Or the smuggler who Catherine forced to kill herself around the start of Book 3, for the grave crime of talking back?

        Or the countless people who have died due to her actions or inaction throughout the story? 

        Letting the Lone Swordsman go at Summerholm, giving Akua governorship of Liesse for political expediency, enslaving the drow and using them to force even more of them into her service...

        The list goes on.

        Catherine is a sympathetic character and our protagonist, but it's not exactly hard to see why someone would be appalled by her.
        ```

        - u/Arganthonius:
          ```
          You're right. I hadn't read those parts in a while and so forgot about them. I mean, I still don't think that the Pilgrim or Laurence would care about the specific examples you listed, but I do think that those are good reasons to dislike Catherine.
          ```

      - u/Rice_22:
        ```
        >*never...swore allegiance to the Gods Below*

        Those ones don't go much for ceremony but rather that you ACT in a certain manner, see: Black. And Cat is certainly a Villain even if she could justify every single one of her actions. She's aware of this as well.
        ```

        - u/signspace13:
          ```
          And we all no that Cat is one for Justifications.
          ```

      - u/Nimelennar:
        ```
        I can see the case that many of this those murders would fall under the category of "executions."

        I can't seem to remember any trials to accompany them, though, so, yes.  Murder.

        I personally disagree with the supposition that there's a moral distinction between the State killing someone who has been given due process, and a fair trial, and then convicted of heinous crimes, and any other flavour of non-defensive intentional killing.  But in that case, I can acknowledge there's an argument to be made that I'm wrong.

        On the other hand, I can't see any real argument that Judge Dredd style, on-the-spot execution, where the only legal opinion that matters is the executioner's, can be considered anything but murder.  And Catherine's done a fair amount of that.

        For truce-breaking, didn't she take out the Exiled Prince under flag of truce?

        I'll grant you that the apotheosis is something they don't know about.

        If she hadn't given her allegiance to Below, Below wouldn't have Named her.

        And while I agree that Cat was left with little choice *but* to serve the Empress, I'm not sure that the Pilgrim and Saint would see it the same way.
        ```

        - u/Ardvarkeating101:
          ```
          > For truce-breaking, didn't she take out the Exiled Prince under flag of truce?

          He specifically was only under his own flag, and they didn't have a truce with the rebels anyway.  Hilariously, that's a sin Cat doesn't have that Tariq does.
          ```

        - u/werafdsaew:
          ```
          The important line that Cat never crossed but Pilgrim did is that Cat never killed people who didn't take up arms.
          ```

  - u/Don_Alverzo:
    ```
    She rose to power through putting down a literally Heroic rebellion of her own countrymen on the Tower's behalf (doesn't matter her intentions, she squashed the last spark of Good in Callow), maintained her rule through tyrannical means (doesn't matter what crimes they committed, crucifying people is bad), she's currently on the SECOND terrible and vast dark power that is a literal incarnation of murder and treachery that she has bound herself to (and apparently Sve Noc is even more horrifying to Tariq than Winter was), her mere existence (supposedly) pulls her entire country towards Evil, and to top it all off the battle they just fought was her defending the Legions that laid waste to half of Procer. Don't get me wrong, I think the Grand Alliance definitely has a warped view of Cat, but I think some readers are a bit too quick to label it all lies and slander. Cat has truly done some nasty things. Now, whether or not those nasty deeds were justified is another matter entirely, but either way it's perfectly reasonable for people to have serious reservations about the Black Queen.
    ```

  - u/ATRDCI:
    ```
    For Pilgrim, She's the Arch Heretic of the East, her being Evil is important in that she is slowly pulling Callow toward being an Evil nation.  The whole Battle of the Camps (including the death of a newbie hero he was mentoring) does exactly make friends.  And the whole point of his mid-battle introspection was that he wasn't acting against the Cat that was, but the Eldritch Abomination finished apotheosis Cat that could be.

    For Saint, she just reenforced that for her being Evil is not only matters, but to her is the ONLY thing that matters.
    ```

  - u/werafdsaew:
    ```
    She's a Villain; everything else is details; the Heroes have done worse things.
    ```

    - u/Academic_Jellyfish:
      ```
      Ah yes, I remember that time the Grey Pilgrim crucified everyone of importance who had worked against his interests.
      ```

      - u/Razorhead:
        ```
        Well the Pilgrim plagued an entire city of innocents. I guess that's even worse, since they didn't even do anything to him.
        ```

        - u/BlackKnightG93M:
          ```
          It wasn't even necessary. Black was on a ship on his way out of the Hamlet. He was tired from overusing his aspects. Pilgrim had a cadre of fresh, Heavens-blessed hardened killers at his side and the second best swordswoman on the continent in the Saint of Swords. There's no way Black survives their scrap. So those deaths weren't necessary.
          ```

          - u/Zayits:
            ```
            I'm not sure how much of it Tariq knew. From his PoV in "Queen's gambit: declined" we only know that he figured out Black would force the heroes to expect him in Iserre, concluded that the only way the Legions could keep running around were the ships left in Saudant, and came up with a killing stroke that would work *no matter what Amadeus would do after entering the city*.

            He may not have known how many legionaries Black Knight would take with him. He couldn't be sure whether they would just raze the place, quietly steal the boats in the night or subdue the locals. He barely was able to estimate when they would even come, because that would depend on the amount of juice left in Amadeus and his willingness to spend it. All Grey Pilgrim was certain of was that the Black Knight would come to that one town while the rest of his forces "sieged" Iserre, and he figured out a way to capitalize on that certainty.

            A plague to ensure that they would die no matter the next step of the plan, even if the ship trick itself was another bait. A ten days incubation period, to account for the timeframe for the legions' arrival and to prevent Amadeus from noticing it. A small town, one where the sickness would have the minimal chance to spread and one the heroes would be actually able to purge afterwards. An ugly solution, sure, but with the information availiable to Tariq it made more sense than, say, charging a Black Knight with unknown tricks up his sleeves.
            ```

          - u/Razorhead:
            ```
            Well they were necessary in the Pilgrim's mentality, for if Black escaped he'd make more victims later. So he sacrificed the people present here to save more people in the future.

            Regardless though it was a dick move.
            ```

- u/imyourfoot:
  ```
  >“That is not in his nature,” I said. “And fae do not change. It is inevitable. Larat who was once the Prince of Nightfall will rise once more, ruler of a court of dusk, and turn on those that raised him. And when that happens-”

  >“- inevitability,” the Grey Pilgrim echoed. “A band of five, like few this world had seen, to smother that infant god in the cradle.”

  >The last words had his face going ashen, for some reason. I supposed the scope of what I’d suggested was beginning to sink in.

  Tariq just realized something significant and Cat didn't notice.  That'll come back to bite her.
  ```

  - u/Mbnewman19:
    ```
    If you recall, earlier on the Peregrine and the Saint were discussing that Fate had 1 last mission for them, a heroic band of 5 people to stop a great evil. Tariq just realized that instead of being heroes one and all, it was going to be this scheme of hers.
    ```

    - u/BlackKnightG93M:
      ```
      More so, once they've fulfilled their Role in killing God-Larat they lose that Story weight. Pilgrim meant to use that weight against the Dead King with Hanno and the Witch and the Champion. 

      Cat just robbed him of that. 

      And though Creation is littered with grooves that grow deeper with time and repetition, ironically it dislikes repeating a particular instance of the Story. One and done. This is why rule of threes don't repeat between the same Named.
      ```

      - u/Zayits:
        ```
        Not sure where you guys take "one last time" from. For the record, the conversation you're referring to (the end of [Kaleidoscope II](https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2018/05/25/interlude-kaleidoscope-ii/)) doesn't have anything on the amount of times a party can lead a war - only that it's not yet the time to assemble one and that someone would have to die for Evil to retreat for good.

        I don't think the party can assemble only for one mission: both villainious examples we have took part in multiple conflict, and the current one can't be declared over until the Dead King calls back his troops anyway. the narrative weight, so far, was more of a rough measurement of what did it take for a given Named to get to the current stage of their story, rather than some expression of "audience's boredom".
        ```

  - u/Academic_Jellyfish:
    ```
    Huh. I took it as him realizing that that sort of inevitability is the same reason he smothered his nephew.
    ```

    - u/imyourfoot:
      ```
      On second thought, I agree with your interpretation.

      I'm a bit surprised he would use that expression.
      ```

      - u/ProfessorPhi:
        ```
        Freudian-esque slip
        ```

- u/Academic_Jellyfish:
  ```
  >“And you would beget this through the murder of one in your service,” Tariq said, not bothering to hide his distaste. **“Could accord not be reached instead?”**

  >[...]

  >**“- inevitability,”** the Grey Pilgrim echoed. “A band of five, like few this world had seen, to **smother** that infant god in the cradle.”

  >**The last words had his face going ashen, for some reason.**

  *Radiant Heavens, it's like we're the same person* - Pilgrim, probably.
  ```

  - u/Trezzie:
    ```
    "...Am I really good? Is she truly evil? Which is the right interpretation?"

    ---

    Makes me think the redemption storyline attempt might get flipped on it's head and Grey Pilgrim go evil.
    ```

- u/notagiantdolphin:
  ```
  I'm really looking forward to Tariq finding out about the Saint dealing Procer that deathblow that Cordelia perceives through the conclave. 

  If the Tyrant manages to pull off the Pilgrim's death instead of Hanno's or the entire choir of Judgement, which seems like a final sacrifice story for good, that might be the thing that pushes him over the edge and do it willingly - learning about Laurence betraying the one thing he set out to build.
  ```

  - u/Mountebank:
    ```
    I get the feeling that Saint is going to end up betraying the band. Cat's putting way too much faith into Saint always listening to Pilgrim when we know that Saint, with the Bard's prodding, has already gone behind Pilgrim's back when dealing with Cordelia. Pilgrim wants the Grand Alliance to succeed, while Saint is making it fall apart.

    This last compromise with Catherine will probably push Saint over the edge and she'll turn on Pilgrim at the worst moment. The fact that Tyrant will also be there is just a giant red herring and a huge bit of irony.
    ```

    - u/werafdsaew:
      ```
      I think it's more likely that the Saint will waste 0 seconds before coming after Cat once Larat is dead.
      ```

- u/MultipartiteMind:
  ```
  So, I take it nobody managed to take and spread the recipes of the Salutary Alchemist when he was put down for extorting people with his monopoly?

  How do you tell which Names are non-Chosen?  Has every Salutary Alchemist been doing the work of Below (in the same sort of way or not, and if in the same way then why didn'r the Chosen have records of what to be on guard against?), or was just this one not a Chosen without being able to switch over for some reason?

  (The solution to an operating system monopoly is not 'smash all computers', the solution to a tea monopoly is not 'dump all tea into the sea', the solution to a medicine monopoly is not 'burn all the medicine'...  Tariq especially seems alarmingly unruffled by the fate of the medicines' recipes and the Saint's presumed culpability, given the extreme relevance for unnecessary suffering.)

  ((I also find myself wondering /why/ all those non-Chosen went against their own interests instead of even one being a bit more cowardly/cautious.  Compulsion from their Name/Role, from Below, from the Story?  Or the inflexibility of each Named being the frozen moment of when they took on that name, Vivienne's Name-loss notwithstanding?  What does this say for Cat, who has the power of a Named without a concrete Name?  A rare free agent while the other pieces are on tracks..?))
  ```

  - u/tavitavarus:
    ```
    The recipe presumably required someone with an Alchemist Name to make it, just like Akua made sure only someone with the Name Diabolist could properly operate the Liesse Doom Fortress.
    ```

    - u/Dent7777:
      ```
      Tell that to Masego
      ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      Or given how magic seems to work in this universe (balance of sacrifices) it probably needed something unpleasant like the soul of a forsaken child to work
      ```

      - u/tavitavarus:
        ```
        “You’d be surprised at the breadth of things that can be powered by the souls of the innocent. Fortresses, swords, my favourite chandelier.”

        —Dread Empress Malevolent II
        ```

  - u/RynnisOne:
    ```
    It sure is funny how the Saint of Swords is so very old and yet in such perfect health, isn't it?

    She was willing to kill the King, what makes you think that killing the Alchemist would be past her?  People remember the first, and as far as she's concerned, that's probably a good thing.  The second's stockpile had to go *somewhere*, after all.
    ```

    - u/Ateddehber:
      ```
      She's not, though. Her age is explicitly taking its toll on her stamina.
      ```

- u/RynnisOne:
  ```
  *"So..."*, says Cat, in her slow drawl, *"I'd like the peanut gallery that's been standing here the whole time to realize what **I** have been willing to give up for you.  That I was willing to kill off the leader of my own band of evil Fae, to create and then challenge a god and slay--at great risk to me and mine--all so that **you** could have a magical highway and avoid getting turned into the Dead King's minions.  When it came down to it, I was **not** the one establishing terms or conditions, merely trying to save all your asses."*


  *"You're welcome."*
  ```

- u/Ristridin1:
  ```
  Assuming that Cat still has a trick to pull... Would Black be a possible candidate for the one? Conveniently, the Rogue Sorceror is carrying his soul (I assume he's keeping it on his person, since hiding it is too dangerous), and it seems like the sort of surprise Cat would pull.

  Black effectively ruled Callow for a while, to the extent that Catherine was able to use that to pull the sword out of the stone in Liesse.

  It depends a bit on how literal the sacrifice needs to be though; Cat probably wouldn't like to lose Black completely. The wording doesn't specify anyone needs to die, so it could be okay (the fact that Cat let the seven listen in suggests she expects them to live).
  ```
