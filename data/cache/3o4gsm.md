## [RT][MK][BST] Please break my setting.

### Post:

Hi everyone! I'm a long-time lurker on this sub, huge fan of the work here. I just made an account specifically to post this, but I hope to post/comment some more in the future!

I'm going to be writing a serial story in a magical sci-fi setting, and hope to make it as Rational as possible. The magic system follows the below rules, and I was hoping to get some feedback. Some specific world-building is included in the description; the main actors are Humanity, and a Confederacy of various magical alien species. The plot is actually sort of Firefly-esque, if the Border Worlds were in an anarchic DMZ, set aside due to a cold war between the two factions, and were filled with organized crime rings instead of quaint villages. And the crew of the Serenity were spies, not smugglers.

I would rather the system not be obviously broken. from the get-go; hence the post. Please do your absolute best to break it as hard as possible. Assume that there are a reasonable number of defectors from magical races to use as test subjects, but human experimentation ethics would apply to them as well. Also assume that human technology, due to magical influence + research, already has things like FTL travel. I can answer any specific existing tech questions as they arise.

TL;DR Warp drives are okay, living gods are not; help me find living gods. 

Thanks, and happy Munchkinry!

1). Magic is biological- either your species has it, or it doesn't. 

* 1a). An individual of a non-magical, sapient species (humans are the only one confirmed), can gain some magical ability through a genetic virus, and therefore pass it on to their offspring. However, the virus has approximately a 50% chance of killing the host, and those so infected generally have a shorter lifespan. The survival rate of said offspring is much higher. 

* 1b). An individual of a non-magical, near-sapient species becomes sapient through prolonged, multi-generational exposure, and becomes a magical species.

* 1c). The virus is ubiquitous among all magical species, but does nothing to them. Earth is now completely infected, but the vast majority of people are immune, and of those not immune, most just die. The rate of people who end up with magical powers (and a lower life expectancy) is about 1 in 100000. 

2). Magic is cast through a combination of somatic and verbal components, and runically-keyed implements. 

* 2a). Each species has its own set of gestures + sounds for basic effects, such as "apply x kinetic energy in y        direction," or "attempt to set x on fire," or "transport object at x location to y location." Magical effects can also be persistent on specific objects; these effects are usually anchored to a rune.

* 2b). More complex spells are simply combinations of (2a) effects. 

* 2c). Complex spells can be keyed to runes, which work as a "shortcut" of sorts, and are activated through individually-created gestures. Runes can be combined with implements for convenience. A "standard library" for runes exists, and most spells are now created with that, unless obfuscation is necessary. 

* 2d). Magic IS linked to sapience, and takes into account concentration + intent for (2a) effects. Spells created with (2b) and (2c) only do so as far as their individual components.

3). Magical individuals of a non-magical species (1a), can only use the basic effects such as those stated in (2a), and said effects tend to backfire and cause physical damage + strain. Training can alleviate some of this, and make misfires mostly trivial, but long-term damage will accumulate.

4). Whatever created the magic in the first place was very likely a "precursor" race of some sort, since it seems to actually "cause" sapience in and of itself. Humanity, for the purposes of magical effects (translation spells, etc), actually already counts as sapient, despite not having magic. The reason for this is unknown. 

* 4a). Because the species that have magic have reality-altering powers from the outset, almost all innovation is of a magical nature. No magical species have even come close to the scientific method, or even questioned their abilities. They do have invention, etc, and even interstellar travel (teleportation, etc), but societies are fairly medieval. 

The following information is determined by humans AFTER first contact, through research.

5). All mages have an organ, similar to a second stomach, that siphons off part of ingested food + similar, stores it as a hyper-dense material of alien chemical makeup. Most magical species have EXTREMELY high caloric requirements, and many have a supplemental source as well, such as solar-cell feathers, etc. Part of the reason that sapient species have such an issue with the virus is it essentially grows this system from scratch, and causes complications with more advanced biology. 

* 5a). When using magic, any energy used is taken by converting this substance to energy ~~with near 100% efficiency~~, and applying it to the world at large. Persistent effects will stop if not powered by something, either the caster, the holder of an object, or another source of energy (some alien plants, crystals, etc can be used as an energy source in this regard).

Again, thanks!

Edit: Formatting

Edit 2: not 100% efficiency, I'd rather magical babies not drop nukes everywhere.

Edit 3: I've made a list of the basic "effects" that will be available to mages; again, anything else is just a combination of these effects. I will add more if you guys, or I, think of them. 

* Temperature manipulation
* Apply a physical force, aka "push x in y direction z hard"
* Teleportaion; this is done via localized wormholes, and requires an ENORMOUS amount of energy. You couldn't realistically pull a Nightcrawler with just personal reserves, but you could move a baseball. It's possible to teleport on a large scale with supplemental energy sources, in fact, that's how their interstellar travel works. The larger the object, the more energy required, but distance does NOT factor in.
* Transmutation of pure substances into other pure substances; the mass remains constant.

Edit 4: More information, by way of discussion

* Human mages that survive can and do donate their magical "kidney stones," which is where the energy is stored. They get paid fairly large sums of money, since magical energy sources are very scarce on earth.

  So, this is "humans don't have X so they've developed higher technology instead", like in Harry Turtledove's "The Road not Taken".

  I would recommend not explaining the physiological details of magic so much to avoid the "midiclorian" problem.

  Breaks your setting right there. One gram yields the equivalent of 21.5 kilotons of tnt - the energy of the Hiroshima atomic bomb. So either all the magical species are gods who with a snap of their finger do interstellar travel or -more likely- are an extinction event. You get multi-megaton bomb organs, and you, and you! Everyone! Even the psychopaths and angry teenagers! And babies! 

  So via selection effects only docile, extremely pacifistic species remain.

  I assume 1c overrides 1a, but as it stands it looks contradictory. Edit: or do you mean half of humanity died after First Contact, but most of the survivors didn't get magical powers?

  >1b). An individual of a non-magical, near-sapient species becomes sapient through prolonged, multi-generational exposure (**to what, magic, the virus?**), and becomes a magical species.

  Wizard german shepherds when? But seriously, that's probably the killer app: not trying to make human mages, but taking this tailor-made EZ-Uplift process to create loyal vassal species.

    The virus passes over the vast majority of people, doing absolutely nothing. If it does affect you, it will try to give you magic; about 50% of the time, you will die. If you survive, you will get magic, but there's still a good chance that's what kills you in the end. If you then have kids, those kids may still have issues, but the prognosis is much higher, and they'll be closer to "normal" health, in addition to magic.

    It's exposure to the virus, though the virus is spread through magical species, so it really is the same either way. It takes hundreds of years for the uplift to take place though; by the time the story takes place, those species are starting to get smarter, but are still non-sapient. The issue with humans is that we were already sapient when we got exposed, so it tried to give us magic **immediately.** Again, the reason for this is a mystery.

      Is it hundreds of years minimum, or is it a function of starting distance from sapience? Because the first probably means humanity would bank on cracking the problem and having its own wizards before it becomes an issue, and the second probably means that a war of extinction was waged on chimpanzees and dolphins and embassies were constructed for bonobos and African Grey parrots.

        I'm going to say both; so it's at least hundreds of years, but it's also a function of distance from sapience. So a...random goldfish? Or something would take a while, far longer than the timescale of the story.

        Honestly, I really like the idea of random species getting uplifted alongside; I might just include that in. One day, a dolphin caught in a fishing net sets the ship on fire with it's mind.

  Teleportation is nice. You've made it possible to create something similar to a [tachyonic antitelephone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tachyonic_antitelephone), except messages are passed instantly. That makes it pretty easy to send information into the past.

  Time dilation is mutual. If I'm on a ship moving at a relativistic speed relative to you, then you perceive my clock ticking slower than yours, just as I simultaneously perceive your clock ticking slower than mine. If you teleport to my ship, you've just gone backwards in time. You'll go backwards again when you teleport home.

  Let's exploit that. Build a ship with a large nuclear reactor to power grow lamps for crops. Include water recycling systems, air recycling systems, and everything else we'll need for mostly self-sufficient living. Have many spellcasters aboard the ship, and use magic to propel the ship as fast as we can make it go.

  After a five years have passed, we can collect all scientific papers and research data published in that period of time and load it onto a microchip smaller than a speck of dust. We can then teleport the chip back and forth between the ship and Earth, sending it further back in time until hardly a year has passed. What happens from here is anyone's guess. Are there many worlds? Does the timeline start over each time someone/something goes into the past?

  Most likely, we will now be able to complete decades of research on a global scale in the blink of an eye. Projects like cloning the magic organs and linking them to computerized neural interfaces might take centuries normally, but now it could all be done in a few years. We'll call these magic interfaces.

  Spell research with the magic interfaces can proceed similarly quickly, allowing humans to rapidly master magic. The most munchkiny use I can think of would be atomic-scale manipulation for on-the-fly genetic engineering and nanotechnology. You're not moving much material, so energy requirements are practically nil, yet gains are massive. Now you can transport nanites to asteroids, moons, and planets, terrforming and industrializing across the galaxy to make worlds suitable for humans and their new-fangled magic interfaces, all in the span of a few decades.

  It's interesting that magic appears to be almost purely offensive.

  Transmutation probably has all kinds of neat uses, but I'm really not a chemist. I mean, I could blow things up, that's about it. Oh, can you transmute a specific element inside an existing compound, something like that? You could also make a nuke with this, so they'll have had nukes for longer than we did. (Incidentally, if it needs to be a reasonably pure element, that's not all that hard.)

  FTL travel is time travel, so there's an obvious loophole (?) right there. It's so common that people will probably suspend their disbelief, though, if they even notice.

  If you can do a sustained acceleration that's faster than gravity, you can go to space with magic alone, I think. Might want to run the numbers, but a majority of the effort of space travel is the Tyranny of the Rocket Equation rather than "real" energy requirements.

  Magical temperature manipulation ... that's neat. Cooling things down is, well, *cooler* than heating them up. You can do some neat things with that.

  Why are humanity immune/carriers, when most other species have evolved some level of symbiosis with this virus? Why are we different?

  It's a shame that there's no way for me to get these powers, since I'm not all that lucky. You could strip away most of a person's body, stick some wires in their brain for motivation, and use them as part of a mechanical magic-based device; but ethics. I bet there are villains doing it, though. Don't even have to be psychopaths, could be an ethnic "they're not people" thing, species-based morality (you see people going on about it sometimes), could be doing it with someone they decided "deserved" it for doing something bad.

  Teleportation ... probably the best use of this is data transfer, but humans probably already have FTL data transfer. Oh, magic satellites is nice. 

  You could make a forcefield with the "apply physical force" thing. Push everything out of an area, once you've got a vacuum it'll feel like a solid object. But sadly, I think it would take too much power to be genuinely useful. The greatest of party tricks, though. And it's a perfect insulator! (Sort of, it's transparent to infrared.) That's handy.

  Oh! Clones. If they have FTL, they've gotta have clones. That's another way for a villain to break the rules; mass-clone people, check them for magic as soon as the fetus'll react to stimulus, kill the ones that don't. You can brute-force magic potential. Heck, you might be able to physically duplicate a magic-user and see if they keep their powers, which they probably will.

  Mass-produced, automated magic is a villains-only tech, and it's really freaking cool. Forcefields! Actual forcefields! Also proper teleportation and some engineering stuff I guess; and better weapons but honestly if you can't kill someone with this magic system you're not even trying.

  >It's possible to teleport on a large scale with supplemental energy sources, in fact, that's how their interstellar travel works.

  Supplemental *what*?!

  The main problem with checking for stable elements  much heavier than Uranium is that the way we create them is to mash two atoms together and hope they stick. Because the neutron to proton ratio for stable isotopes goes up the higher we go, this results in heavy atoms of provably less stable isotopes than what we would get with more neutrons.

  So. Your transmutation. Does it allow mages to create superheavy elements? Because there very likely are elements up there that are, if not stable, at least stable enough to have a half life of months or centuries rather than nano seconds. I know in my own world I use this as an excuse to shove in Orichalcum and a few other imaginary materials.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    > Does it allow mages to create superheavy elements? 

    I would say yes, although it's really difficult, and requires substantial energy + initial materials. The amount of particles stay the same, so if you have 4 mol of carbon for example, you'll end up with a fractional amount of Orichalcum.
    ```
