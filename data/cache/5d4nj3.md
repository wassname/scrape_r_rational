AO3 [Chapter 18](http://archiveofourown.org/works/7441657/chapters/19639078)

I originally planned this as two chapters, but they seemed too short on their own so I just combined them.  Then, after later edits, they probably would've been fine separately and are now a bit *long* together, but I'm not changing it, you can't make me.  ;P

### Comments:

  ```
  Pretty great. Seems like an unwitting horcrux still requires remorse to fix. And maybe something a little extra.
  ```

  - u/Achille-Talon:
    ```
    *Is* it a Horcrux? If anyone in this situation was Horcruxed, it was Older Hermione, not Hermione. What you're saying would be like if (in canon) *Harry* had to feel remorse to fix the Voldemort Horcrux inside his head.
    ```

    - u/Gigapode:
      ```
      Yeah good point. 

      You could say that Harry felt some remorse during all that though. Or you could say that Hermione has been split in two, while Harry was the horcrux receptacle rather than the horcruxee. So maybe it works different.
      ```

  Maybe my reading comprehension is poor, but it wasn't clear to me that the events of last chapter resulted in a horcrux.

  Now, with an unknown amount of time passing as we see all the many (many) hallucinations pass through her mind's eye, I'm left wondering how much of the ~~plot~~ Character development until now has been reset by this epiphany.

    ```
    I think they're talking about OH's concern (noted in Tempus Torqueri pt 1) that she had somehow made a Horcrux out of YH's copy of *Hogwart's, a History* at the start of the whole misadventure.

    As for the other concern - it's a dream.  I'm not saying there's *nothing* meaningful in it (what would the point of including it be, otherwise?) but as far as Hermione is concerned, how seriously one takes dreams is a matter of personal preference.  I suppose in a world where magic, possession and prophecy are *actual factors*, it's a lot harder to dismiss them entirely, but it *was* very silly...

      > but it was very silly...

      What do you mean silly? It was a perfectly perspicuous perusal of Hermione's fuck-ups interspersed with ominous portents of Fate/Time/Some-Other-Power-That-Be screwing everything up. A treasure trove of useful information! :P

  I miss you!

- u/Husr:
  ```
  Oh yay I love extended dream sequences.
  ```

  - u/RobinDrew:

    I'm *assuming* this is sarcasm, though it's often hard to tell with strangers in a text medium.  If it isn't, disregard the rest.  :)

    FWIW, if by 'extended' you just mean the second part is too long, sorry about that.  Dispassionately trimming is a hard-won self-editing skill, and I know I'm not there yet.

    [OTOH](#s " If you mean you're concerned that it will last *beyond this chapter* - it won't.")

    > all **what** has been will come to be,

    Maybe meant to be "that". "what" in this context sounds vaguely Cockney.
    ```

    - u/RobinDrew:
      ```
      As intended.  It's doggerel, but I think I just liked the alliteration with "will" there.
      ```

  - u/HermioneGPEV:
    ```
    This sentence is very hard to parse without the missing comma:

    > But he had seen through her edging towards her wand, and seemed much better at intuiting intent than she was now that he wasn't as overconfident - certainly better than she was at deceiving in the first place.

    Another sentence got split into two:

    > â€œShe did manage, sort of, to defeat a rat in magical combat, though that is only slightly more impressive than it sounds, considering. She could have just told me about it
    ```

    - u/RobinDrew:
      ```
      Where were you expecting a comma?  Between "was" and "now"?

      The second one is as intended.  A trailing ", considering." would be read the same as ", all told.", ", all things considered.", etc., it's the informal adverbial use.  Dumbledore might not use it in normal speech, but it seemed apt for flippant dream-Dumbledore.
      ```

      - u/HermioneGPEV:
        ```
        Sorry for the delay. Yes, I would have expected:

        > But he had seen through her edging towards her wand, and seemed much better at intuiting intent than she was, now that he wasn't as overconfident - certainly better than she was at deceiving in the first place.

        If you do not read attentively, you might try parsing "she was now" at the beginning of a proposition, and fail to grasp the structure of the sentence. Since the sentence itself is unusually complex, it was enough to confuse me.

        Oh right, I see, thanks for the clarification!

          Gotcha.  I threw a hyphen in there instead, I think it makes more sense anyway with "now that he wasn't as overconfident" as an offset qualifier.

          Thanks!

  Finally some catharsis.
  ```

- u/technoninja1:
  ```
  What's with the Trade Mark thing? It's a little too meta for my tastes.
  ```

  - u/RobinDrew:
    ```
    It's meant to be surreal, but not meta.  This is Hermione's dream, she's muggle-born, and entirely familiar with both McDonald's and trademarks.  The surreal part is *Dumbledore* mentioning it (and pronouncing it), though even in the waking world, you can never really be sure with him.  :)

  eh? this is the end?
