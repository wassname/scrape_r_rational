## [Q]At what point do you stop reading something?

### Post:

So I recently started the Wheel of Time series and I absolutely hated it.
I couldn't even get through half of the first book and I'm now considering stopping it all together.

What do you guys do when you encounter something highly recommended which you didn't like? Force yourself through it or just drop it without further thought?

  It depends on a lot of things. If I've been forewarned that the early parts are bad/boring, I'm more likely to stick it out. If it's something that I've spent money on (or otherwise expended some kind of effort on), I'm more likely to try to see it through. If I'm expected to report back (usually because I borrowed a book, and you can't do that without the question of whether you liked it) I'm more likely to give it longer. And I tend to read in "chunks", so the end of the first book of a trilogy is a much more likely stopping place.

  As far as reading goes, my time is valuable, and wasting it on something that I don't enjoy is not something I'm willing to do. I haven't been without a backlog of books in a decade. I don't stop reading things without thinking about it first, but I don't tend to hesitate too much when there's something that I'm not enjoying - usually when I'm bored, but also sometimes when I don't like a character. I stopped reading *The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant* when he [](#s "raped a woman"), because that shredded the last of my interest in the main character.

  I had intended to read *The Wheel of Time*, and just like you, I stopped midway through the first book, because it didn't seem like anything was happening. I was also motivated by the fact that people had said that somewhere between four and eight books in the series were boring, which shifted the cost-benefit analysis.

  Sometimes when people say to just keep reading something that's unenjoyable, I feel like they're suffering from the literary equivalent of Stockholm Syndrome.

    Finishing boring books is an example of the sunk cost fallacy. So from a utilitarian point of view, it makes sense to drop a book as soon as the expected joy is greater elsewhere.

    Social pressure is a big factor. I only read the first book of the Divergent trilogy, although my family are a big fans. I will watch the movies with my wife. After the Hunger Games, Divergent feels like just more of the same to me. Maybe it's an age thing. Maybe reading into LessWrong spoiled the genre for me.

  I stop reading the moment I find myself not enjoying the material anymore. I mostly notice this when I'd rather do some housework or go to sleep than read any further.

  If it's highly recommended by someone I trust, I'll give it one additional attempt after first deciding to quit.

  The first reason I have to drop something is lack of engagement. If it's not fun, why am I reading it? But more specifically there's a laundry list of 'sins' fiction can commit that will just immediately cause me to lose interest.

  I will say that if you hate WoT now, it will only get much, much worse for you. I'd recommend dropping it ASAP.

  I have a very hard time dropping a story after I've gotten into it, mostly because no matter how boring it is, I keep needing to know how it's going to end. If I'm more then 5 chapters in, the chance of me giving it up are very slim. It takes a truly horrendous turn for the worse for me to give up on a story halfway, and even then, I still need to find out what happens (good thing there's a wiki for almost anything these days).

  It's even worse if it's a series of books that start really good and get progressively worse as they go. Dropping a series of books I've gotten into is nearly impossible, what with all the loose ends and hooks and everything else. So far the only series that got so bad I had to drop it was Anita Blake, and even then, I still read the summary of every book when it comes out.

  One thing I do to sort of counter this is to put it on hold. I can't do it indefinitely, but if a book is really boring and I can't drop it, I'll put it aside for while and go read something better, than come back to it at a latter time (the crossing Mordor part at the end of Return of the King   made me put it on hold for almost six months).

  I stop reading (or start skimming if I'm invested in the end of the story already) when...

  1. The story is spending lots of time explaining something that's not interesting. (i.e. I skimmed through some of the speeches in Atlas Shrugged.)
  2. The emotions that are too painful like in 
  [Hunger Games:](#s "I couldn't handle it when Katniss' little sister dies because saving her was the whole point of Katniss' odyssey and in the end she died horribly anyway. I stopped reading and only finished the book several months later because several friends goaded me about it. I finished what I started, but I didn't enjoy it.")
  [Harry Potter:](#s "I couldn't handle it when Snape told his story of unrequited love, and then died alone with nothing. I have also been in love with someone who didn't return it. I'm now single and a bit older than the average marriage age for my gender. Dying unloved and alone is the scariest feeling in the world and I cried a lot before I finished that book.")
  or the awkwardness of pretty much every sitcom episode ever.
  3. The story simply isn't believable. Some authors completely skip the crisis in their plot. A story of constant success gets old quick. Some authors just suck at dialogue or give characters reactions that real people simply wouldn't have. 
  4. The grammar and diction are wrong, horrible and/or repetitive. I can't read more than one or two books in a row from most authors because they have favorite words and phrases that they reuse a lot. I notice those and start cringing. Change stuff up! Explore new styles! (this causes me problems with some people IRL too)

  From a time perspective, I'll rarely slog through more than half an hour of any of the above before giving up. If someone I respect recommended the book I might make it twice that, but ultimately things have to pick up or I'm out.

  I stop reading when I no longer care what happens next, and there are no burning questions I want to find the answer to.

  Usually those go hand in hand, but occasionally I don't care about the story and continue on just so that I'll learn more about the world.

  This backfires when I get a question that the author never even intends to answer. I read the entire belgariad et al series by David Eddings just so I could get more information on what the gods of that setting were. There were so intriguing by the few details, like how apparently they couldn't heal themselves, so the rare attack that hurt them was always permanent, and how one went mad from grief, and a bunch of characterization about the few gods that actually got on stage for a while.

  And once the story ends, they just up and leave for no good reason.

  I asked for the first three books last Christmas.  I got about halfway or a third of the way through the first one and then stopped (Christmas break had ended so I was back to school and had less time, and they were boring).  I had pinged through Worm that September I recall.  It kept occurring to me that Worm had managed to keep me up till the wee hours of the morning every night I had read it, and the wheel of time books just seemed to pointlessly drag on in comparison.
  ```

  When the expected utility gain from continuing to read is less than the opportunity cost incurred by the time spent reading.

  Sure, it may be a good story, and I may enjoy it more if I continue reading (as others may insist). But is it at present the best way of fulfilling my literary desires? Usually this isn't an explicit calculation, but more of a gut feel.

  I tend to juggle books around when they slow down, but as I finish more engaging stories I usually come back if I have a reasonable expectation of enjoyment. Case in point, I've been worming my way through Worm for a few months now.

  Goes the same for other media as well.
