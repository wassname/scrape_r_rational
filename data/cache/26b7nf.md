  It doesn't do particularly well at the whole 'show process, not magical outcomes' part of rational!fic, and it falls into all the common pitfalls about writing for very intelligent characters; that said I still read the whole thing and enjoyed it.  

  I just think it's important to maintain a distinction between "Rational Fiction" as such, and stories about very smart characters.

  Something for everyone to read over the weekend! A (completed) story with rational!LexLuthor.
