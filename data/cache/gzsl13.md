## The Value of the Weighted Die

### Post:

As wertifloke, author of *The Waves Arisen*, can neither confirm nor deny that he once wrote, 

> If you’re writing Naruto fanfiction, then either skip the Wave arc entirely, or do something TRULY AMAZING with Zabuza and Haku and every step of the journey along the way, because if I have to read ONE MORE fight against the Demon Brothers, I don’t care if your version of Naruto kills them with NUCLEAR WEAPONS, I am going to sigh at you.

> If something has been done a dozen times before, there’s no point in showing it to the reader yet again. In fanfiction this is an even more urgent problem. If a canon event has to happen for plot reasons, but it isn’t being done really amazingly differently, then show only the part that *is* amazing.  Better yet, just have the viewpoint character remember the whole thing afterward for two paragraphs. Don’t write it out in a whole chapter.

It’s surprising then that *The Waves Arisen* plays the bell test straight. It does indeed pretty much just involve Naruto killing Kakashi, so to speak, with nuclear weapons.

It helps that the bell test is genuinely clever and smart in the canonical source material. The test emphasizes a major theme of *Naruto*, which is how problems can only be resolved by overcoming doubts about personal worth and the selfish intentions of others to work together toward prosocial goals, and also cool ninja fights, which is *Naruto* in a nutshell. Also, it’s totally something that Kakashi would do, and all three members of Team 7, Naruto, Sasuke, and Kakashi, display crucial elements of their personalities. I believe Sakura is there as well.

Of course, wertifloke doesn’t play the test entirely straight. Naruto is smart now, having specced into Mathematics, which the game designers made totally broken once you get far enough into the abilities tree. He instantly sees through Kakashi’s trap to make them work against each other. Yet astoundingly, the story actually works to pull things back *toward* the canon bell test, with Sasuke request to 1v1 Kakashi *anyway*. Then the others join in, and we get some exposition about how ninjutsu works and set up the hiding-as-clones-as-not-clones thing for later, but overall nothing in this scene so far is a significantly original take on the source material.

Then this happens:

> “I suppose I could condemn you the *least*, Uzumaki Naruto,” Kakashi said. “That was a clever ploy you used to get your classmates to follow your plan unquestioningly. If one of them had actually managed to take a bell then your weighted dice would have probably been enough to secure your own success, at least.”

> Naruto looked up at him, dazed. “Huh?”

> “What weighted dice?” Sasuke said.

> "In his left pocket,” Kakashi said.

> Naruto felt around in his pocket and pulled out a little bone dice he’d never seen before. “H—hey! This isn’t *mine*.”

> Sasuke didn’t look convinced.

This is fucking brilliant. Everything that’s just been accomplished, with Naruto and his team gelling far more quickly than they ever did in canon, has been flipped on its head. Naruto’s own cleverness in seeing through the ploy has been turned against him. Everything about the original context of the challenge is maintained—how to teamwork when you can’t trust—but with a miniature explosion of originality. 

*Kakashi was listening, and came up with a plan.*

> One unavoidable difficulty of trying to put optimizing sparks inside your characters is that none of the characters want your plot to happen.

*Kakashi does not want the kids to pass his test.*

> Kakashi turned to the others. “I will tell you two, at least, that this was *not* intended to be a mere test of teamwork that only required you three to work together, as Naruto suggested. This is a filter, and it’s designed to weed out the students who aren’t ready to be ninja.”

> “That’s *such a lie*,” Naruto snapped. “Maybe that’s what you have to say out loud, but I think we all know the real reason for the test is that you just need to invent some official justification for sending us all back to the academy. I don’t know what it is you’d rather be doing, but I can’t really believe that the last five teams were all unworthy of being *genin*. Sasuke was by far the top of our class, I did okay myself, and I’m pretty sure there are jounin teams who would *pay* just to carry Hinata around in a box as a surveillance tool. By any *reasonable* standard for three genin a single day out of the academy, we did fine.”

*Hinata doesn’t like moldy cheeses.*

Genin die on their own, so Kakashi developed a test to demonstrate their lack of teamwork and send them back to the academy. He doesn’t do this to make them better ninja, he does this because he can’t handle the pain of losing his adorable *kouhai*.

So when Naruto sees through the test, Kakashi doesn’t “throw down the key in disgust and walk away,” as wertifloke never described Thorin doing. He comes up with a new plan.

What’s brilliant about this plan is that it’s simultaneously *clever and surprising* and *totally logical.* I don’t think *anyone* reading this chapter for the first time thought to themselves, “If I were Kakashi, I’d just put a die in Naruto’s pocket and claim it’s loaded, that way I could break their trust and have my excuse to send them back to the academy.” But of course the reader is just enjoying the story, whereas Kakashi-the-character *fucking does not want these kids to be genin.* So Kakashi-the-character thinks, “Fuck, how do I get these kids to fail?” And he remembers that when Sasuke and Naruto disagreed about the division of the bells, Naruto solved the problem by proposing they roll dice. So…weighted dice in Naruto’s pocket.

Of course, their fight against Kakashi completely establishes his ability to sneak the die into Naruto’s clothing.

And Naruto starts optimizing right the fuck back at Kakashi. He doesn’t start thinking, “Oh, I guess the author wants me to fail or something, or have some kind of emotional conflicts with my team, better cry and protest that no one trusts me because 9 tails boo hoo.” He starts going

> "and how the fuck could I have even known to bring a trick dice along, anyway? I didn’t know what kind of fucking test we would be doing!"

> Hinata looked over it with her byakugan. “It—it’s real, at least. It’s not any kind of motherfucking genjutsu illusion,” she said, “not that I think—”

> “You didn’t see me carrying it before, right? Your eyes see through fucking everything, did you see him slip it into my pocket or something? He’s still screwing with us.”

And Sasuke doesn’t start thinking, “Oh, I guess the author wants Naruto to smart his way out of this one, better be convinced by his logic since I know this scene has to end with us passing.” Sasuke thinks, “I don’t want to get fucking tricked and made to look stupid.”

> “But why the fuck would *Kakashi* just happen to have brought a trick dice, then?” Sasuke asked. “He didn’t know you were going to try to make us roll a dice to get the bells, and you were the one to tell us about all the teams he failed, so maybe you already knew what the test was, too. You came up with the dice idea pretty fast.”

> “It’s not mine!” Naruto repeated. “Look, it’s not covered in my fucking chakra yet, right Hinata? So it couldn’t have been copied when I had to get away from the *fireball* that almost killed us. And besides, how did he even know which pocket I had it in, if he didn’t put it there? Or how would he have known that it wasn’t just a *normal* dice? Maybe he carries it because he likes to cheat at dice games—or it might not even *be* a trick dice!”

The easy way to make this test be original is to have Naruto see through the two bells ploy and have them come up with some super teamwork attack involving all the stuff he’s learned about kage bunshin and transformation to defeat Kakashi. The hard way is to have Kakashi kick Naruto in the mental balls for trying.

Nothing about the easy way actually changes the meaning of the scene. It’s actually worse than the original story, since “here’s neat tricks you can do with ninjutsu” is much less important than establishing the significant theme of teamwork. In the hard way, every character grabs hold of the story and tries to wrest it away from the others. Doing so allows beautiful new character moments and themes to emerge—at the expense of Kakashi’s ego.

> Sasuke leant back on his elbows, “Mmm… pretty dumb test though.”

> Kakashi narrowed his gaze.

In sum, *The Waves Arisen* is really good, doing original stuff should be understood in terms of a change in character or circumstance that causes optimizing characters to impose new meanings on a scene and does **not** mean using nuclear weapons to win fights from canon, and crucial twists or changes can come from the smallest extensions of foregrounded ideas.

Also, it’s hilarious.

> “*This dice isn’t even rigged!*” he shouted, pelting it at the back of Kakashi’s head.

> He dodged it, though.

> Of course.

      Sasuke giving advice to naive, confused Naruto about Hinata's secret desires (for clan vengeance) feels too much like Harry and Draco in the robes shop. Too funny, and too original.

        What is the speculation on Elizer writing erogamer? Is there evidence or do we just attribute all weird rational works to him? Erogamer author seems to have specific kinks that I have never seen EY talk about.

          As someone who was once accused of being an Eliezer alt for writing an omake, I'm *very* sceptical of Eliezer being Groon (the author of The Erogamer). 

          A year before Groon started The Erogamer, they wrote [Taylor Hebert: Harem Protagonist](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/taylor-hebert-harem-protagonist.26134/). It's pretty clearly a first draft of the later work in terms of its premise, and also pretty difficult to see as an intermediate step between HPMOR and the Erogamer, in terms of its writing quality.

          I've yet to see any evidence presented for the two authors being the same person beyond the existence of readers who enjoyed both of their works.

      Wait... what?

      I never heard any speculation that you wrote it.

      To be honest, if you wrote it then I'm *disappointed*. I thought there were TWO great writers out there (I've read and loved several of your works, and of course I very much loved *The Waves Arisen*); if you wrote it then that's one fewer excellent writer of this sort of fiction.

      But I have no idea why, if you did write it under a pen name, you would want to keep the identities separate. Ah well... not really my business -- that's for you and Wertifloke to worry about.
      ```

      - u/absolute-black:
        ```
        It's a pretty common theory. Wertifloke is 1) extremely talented, and 2) has no other works to their name, so clearly a pen name. EY has admitted to writing under different pen names before, and posts comments like this.

        I've been fervently reassured I didn't need to be familliar with anything *Naruto* to read *The Waves Arisen*, so when I did, I harbored for a bit a certain sense of betrayal... Because yes, the story's amazing and the important parts are very enjoyable even without context, but the story also keeps doing really frustrating things like name-dropping things and acting like they'll be explained later or like the reader's supposed to already know what they are (the ninja-police) and not explaining them at all, or even worse, mentioning things like that once and then never again (the ninja-dogs).

        So, future readers, consider yourself warned: you might want to keep open Narutopedia at hand :)

  How I wish I could put this up as a banner in the Worm section of the SB/SV forums. It's honestly gotten to the point where I have to wonder if they do it just feel better about their word count, or if a lot of these writers are genuinely scared of doing anything else that isn't retreading canon with a different flavoring. Anyone familiar with Worm fanfics probably already knows what scenes and events I'm talking about that have been done ad nauseum.

  Also, it's a bit funny how much thought went into this fic's bell test, and yet you have stuff like this in it:

  >Hinata looked over it with her byakugan. “It—it’s real, at least. It’s not any kind of motherfucking genjutsu illusion,”

  I'm not one of those people that thinks no one should swear ever, and I understand that kids and teens irl swear a lot, but it still feels kind of weird to read Naruto and Hinata saying fuck. Not to say their entire characterization is undermined by a couple swear words, just that it doesn't bode well when the original character doesn't do it much or at all.

  I haven't read The Waves Arisen (yet) so maybe there's some sort of justification for it, might as well give it a shot since it seems like an interesting take at least.

  >doing original stuff should be understood in terms of a change in character or circumstance that causes optimizing characters to impose new meanings on a scene and does not mean using nuclear weapons to win fights from canon

    Honestly any fanfic that doesn't have Naruto swearing regularly is translating from Japanese poorly. Maybe he should just be adding "dammit" to every other sentence, but there is no reasonable way to translate the 'dattebayo' verbal tic that doesn't involve frequent mild-or-stronger profanity. (Though you'd be right for Hinata.)

    > How I wish I could put this up as a banner in the Worm section of the SB/SV forums.

    Have you read [El-Ahrairah](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/el-ahrairah-worm.372987/)? It solidly avoids this. Mainly by Switching Taylor to a Thinker (same shard, different aspect) and then dealing with the consequences of Contessa reacting to her existence, but it deliberately stays far afield even given that. That and [Something Completely Different](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/something-completely-different-worm-tinker-si-original-city.25042/) (light-hearted by Worm standards fic about a transhumanist SI who is a Tinker whose specialty is working with corpses) are my favorites by far. (Though as I am a vocal disliker of the original my opinions possibly should be discounted, I admit.)

      Erh, no, not really? at least from what I remember from when I used to care about Naruto, dattebayo doesn't really mean anything, it's just a way to denote how crude and uncultured his way of speaking is. It's not one of those things that translate directly into English, so for such cases it's best to give the character a slight accent, or have them use simpler words than the rest of the cast. Having them constantly swearing can detract a lot from the story too, it can shift the focus away from what is important or even be a way to flanderize a character. If you've read Worm and then fanfics you'll probably notice that Shadow Stalker is always portrayed as someone who swears like a sailor, she doesn't really do that to that level in canon, her violence is often described and portrayed as physical. Same with Cockblocker who is always screaming Bullshit, when he said it like once in canon.

      This all might come across as nitpicky, mostly because it is, but even these small things often serve as a flag for the quality of what you're reading. Although in this very specific case (The Waves Arisen) the point is moot because the swearing was added by the OP and wasn't on the writing itself. Still, you can see the negative effects just by way of us discussing this instead of what OP was proposing and would have preferred us discussing.

      F-bombs are best left saved for the moments that truly deserve it, imo.

      I have, I also read my fair share of wormfics some years ago until I got sick of it, sadly the fics with decent writing are a minority. In retrospective it's kinda funny that for all of the flack that the Memorial trilogy (Cenotaph/Wake/Legacy) constantly gets the vast majority of fics don't compare or even come close. That for every *Weaver Nine*, *Copacetic* or *Loaf* you get like thirty lazy Alt-Powers that start with Taylor triggering in the locker, fighting Lung, meeting Lisa in the Boardwalk, The Bank, and then dying before or during the Leviathan fight. There is no creativity, little to no desire to expand or invent something new, and from my experience from trailing these accursed forums, SB is mostly to blame. You can see why I moved on lmao, it's just more fun to read other webfics or pick an actual book once in a while.

        It's crude, uncultured, aggressive, and *rude*. And the way you convey crude, uncultured, and rude in English, especially if you're also conveying aggressive, is frequent swearing. Frequent *mild* swearing is totally sufficient; as I said, including "dammit" into every other sentence is a pretty good translation. I'm more of a linguist than an actual manga fan, so I don't have a great handle on how rude he is beyond that; at a guess, frequent stronger profanity would be overdoing it, and the appropriate level of profanity is roughly "Jayne Cobb". (Hinata, obviously, should be at the level of Simon Tam.)
        ```

        - u/Anew_Returner:
          ```
          That's fair, a damn/dammit would indeed be way more appropriate and inline with the character. It wouldn't be my first choice as a writer, but I can see it as some sort of endearing quirk like the original 'dattebayo' is (or is supposed to be).

          >I'm more of a linguist than an actual manga fan, so I don't have a great handle on how rude he is beyond that; at a guess, frequent stronger profanity would be overdoing it

          I don't think canon Naruto's rudeness goes beyond his dattebayo or the occasional chikushou whenever something goes wrong, and even then his character isn't a mean-spirited one (in social interactions). Remember that his whole dream about being hokage is more about being accepted by his village than about the power of ruling over them.

Because SS also fucking died, because of course she did the girl tried to save some civilians from Bakuda and had some bad timing and was an unbalanced child soldier fighting someone way out of her league who wasn't disarmed by the MC beforehand.
