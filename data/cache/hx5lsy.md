## Recommendations for Wuxia/Xianxia/Xuanhuan?

### Post:

I've read:

* Cradle
* A Thousand Li
* Heart of Cultivation
* Ave Xia Rem Y

I've heard of:

* Street Cultivation
* Forge of Destiny
* Forty Millenniums of Cultivation
* Grandmaster Strategist
* Reverend Insanity, The Magus Era, Way of Choices and Nightfall (not sure if they are rational)
* I don't think it counts as 'rational' but all works by Er Gen and I Eat Tomatoes, some I've finished

It doesn't need to be completely rational; that's too strict for Wuxia/Xianxia/Xuanhuan. I would honestly take any recommendation that goes up to the standards of /r/rational.

  Cultivation Chat Group! It's more comedy though.

  Would you recommend all the ones you've read?

    Yep, I only listed those that 'I deem worthy'. However they all have the same flaw for some reason, that being they all start slow. Cradle is undoubtedly my recommendation if someone wants to get into Wuxia/Xianxia/Xuanhuan.

  Seconding Forge of Destiny, as far as ones you've heard of go.
  ```

  Highly recommend reverend insanity or lord of the mysteries, I consider both among the best of the genre.

  I really liked *Changing Faces* (same author as *Street Cultivation*.) It's more LitRPG than cultivation, though. But there are so many times when there's a setup for a dumb choice to drive the plot, and then the characters... just *talk to each other* instead. Or notice their own irrational habits of thought and consciously try to change them.

  If you've ever read *Wheel of Time* and now have a permanent itch because of how *dumb* all the characters were, then *Changing Faces* is like a soothing balm for it.

  (Also, it's only three short books with a solid ending.)

  [edit: the series is *New Game Minus*, *Changing Faces* is the name of the first book.]

  It's not *really* very rational, but if you want a legitimately great wuxia, I recommend watching Thunderbolt Fantasy. It's a great Taiwanese wuxia show, made with the assistance of a Japanese animation studio.

  And while it's mostly just wuxia storytelling, it does have a pretty well-executed "master strategist" character who does some amusing anime-level plans.

  The Path Unending is a lot of fun.  It's a quest, but it's posted to Royal Road as an ordinary fiction.

  [Arrogant Young Master, Template A Variation 4](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/28601/arrogant-young-master-template-a-variation-4) is a light, fairly satirical/genre-aware piece. 

  If follows a xianxia reader who wakes up to find themselves as the generic early antagonist of a typical xianxia novel. They set about using their genre savviness to escape the traps and tropes such template characters tend to fall into.

  I'd not put it down as a great work, but it's a fun enough read to fill time.

    Itâ€™s amazing how quickly this story fell apart. It started off as satire, then turned into the very thing it was satirizing, then the author disappeared.
    ```

      ```
      I think (or hope) the author was trying to do A Thing, but then COVID attacked their country and/or health issues flared up again before that thing was transparently revealed to the audience.  There is a real chance the author has died.  Turkey was hit hard.
      ```

      - u/ecletico:
        ```
        Officially, Turkey "only" had 5674 deaths due to Covid. In terms of chances, if the author died, it would probably be due to something else.
        ```

          ```
          That's ambivalent news, then! Hopefully the author is okay.

  Defiance of the Fall is a litrpg/xianxia hybrid. It's really tropey but written by a western author so no translation or grammar issues. The characters aren't amazing, but they aren't as egregiously bad as you sometimes see in typical xianxia either. The main character isn't too smart or talented, so he has to rely on treasures and his high luck stat to provide him opportunities, which can and does result in him getting hurt or even crippled. But of course, he's the protagonist, so he survives and becomes better than before. I recommend it for light reading.

  He who Fights with Monsters is kinda xianxia kinda jrpg. Really neat system with nice power levels. The main character is sorta an asshole though, and sometimes the item and skill descriptions take away from the flow of a chapter. It's better written than Defiance. So if you can handle the assholery of the protagonist, the other characters are actually pretty fun and the humor is usually good. 

  Paragon of Destruction is also written by  a western author, and is on a slightly higher level of quality than Defiance of the Fall. It starts off pretty bad tbh, with the protagonist getting lucky breaks and acquaintances who are willing to raise his power, but it gets better. Once the protagonist starts traveling alone more, he starts taking more initiative. Around chapter 150+ is where it hits its stride imo. Power is still something he wants to attain, but it comes from himself and his ideas instead of random guy turning out to be a sage or something (usually).

  [The Sage who Transcended Samsara](https://www.novelupdates.com/series/the-sage-who-transcended-samsara/) is a unique Wuxia/Infinity mix, with some mystery elements.

  I also recommend the author's other works.
  ```

  - u/HantuAnggara:
    ```
    Ooh, LoTM's author wrote this? Instant interest but it seems to have bad reviews, should I just ignore them?
    ```

- u/happyfridays_:
  ```
  [Broken Chains](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/23878/broken-chains) is decent enough.

  Characters are more human than some xianxia. The sympathetic ones don't do the whole amoral destroy the weak schtick.

  Please note, I've made it about 60% through what's written and we're still low on the power tier. Story is still early on.
