## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding and Writing Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*
* Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is *also* the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday Recommendation thead)

  What are some interesting, but largely unexplored, [cyberpunk derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberpunk_derivatives) settings or concepts?

    Literally use a random word generator and put "-punk" after it, and you'll have one. 

    Doing this now using 5 from https://randomwordgenerator.com/ , I got:

     - Acceptablepunk: A very gray generic suburbian experience of eternal failed potential, a feeling of being left behind and stagnation.

     - Partypunk: Like cyberpunk, but going REALLY heavy on the drugs and neon, as well as taking the decadence flaws that normally are only applied to the rich in cyberpunk instead applied to the whole population via post scarcity automation. Also explores toxic positivity.

     - Hikepunk: A nomadic and outdoorsy but non the less technologically advanced civilization, extrapolating MallNinjaShit and prepper bunker to an entire society. Highly focused on survival and post apocalyptic; in fact, just take any generic post apocalyptic setting and give everyone the high tech new and clean gear via some macguffin fabricator technology and you're close. 

     - Debtpunk: This is just normal cyberpunk isn't it? maybe a bit less neon and a bit more grey, with a prison aesthetic?

     - Thronepunk: The 40k imperium, but with more complex interplay betwen multiple royalties, and heavy prince-ness-proliferation like in saudi arabia
    ```

    - u/Camaraagati:

      Debtpunk brings to mind a grimdark version of the late 17th-early 18th century England. The social conditions of the post-South Sea Bubble, except much more severe and permanent. 

      For the random word generator, I got:

      - Moodpunk: Aesthetic and technology of the 1970s, a society focused on a hegemonic neo-religious cult whose followers are distinguished by wearing mood rings and having an emphasis on regulating their emotions, not becoming agitated.

      - Depthpunk: A variation on atompunk, instead of the Cold War spurring the Space Race, it triggers the Depth Race. Technological milestones, militarization, and colonization of the underwater. Advances in submarines, underwater cities, etc.

      - Churchpunk: A hyper-denominational society based on the early 19th century USA's Second Great Awakening. Various restorationist and revivalist movements compete for domination of society, each often only having enough followers to fill a single church.

      ```
      Cory Doctorow touches on all but the last, sometimes combining them.
      ```

  - u/Freevoulous:
    ```
    Hopepunk (often also called solarpunk for some reason): a derivative that explores what happens when the punks of cyberpunk finally win, defeat the System (or at least, escape it), and build a positive, free, techno-anarchist society.

    Examples would be the end of the Daemon/Freedom series by Suarez, and most of Cory Doctorow's works.

    Isn't [Twig](https://twigserial.wordpress.com/) biopunk?
    Wildbow describes the setting as "Alternate history: What if Victor Frankenstein was real and started a scientific revolution that was extremely lopsided toward biology? (Except his name wasnâ€™t Frankenstein)"

  How extensive would a system of thermal vents need to be to support a community of 1,000 humans? The vents feed chemolithotrophs such as those found deep undersea.
  ```

  - u/Dragfie:
    ```
    I would assume A LOT. I don't think a single vent could support a single human's dietary requirements; unless it super long and/or large.

    For a complete layman, I always found the basic sanitation advise (and the reasons behind it) to be the most realistic.

    If you are an expert in any field however, I think that can be quite useful: an engineer would have basic knowlage on mathematics, alloys, construction methods and materials like concrete and design principals and most important of all: electricity. All these by themselves won't be super useful unless you remember exact formulas, but can be very valuable to a local expect in the field.

    The easiest to introduce of the above is electricity IMO. If you have wires and a magnet you can generate it, and once you can show a spark you can get research to continue on other things like light bulbs etc, which as long as you know its a vacuum inside you can think up solutions for how to make them. Lights is the easiest low-hanging fruit of electricity but motors and early phones are not too complex either.

    I think the most difficult part would be not getting lynched as a heretic (simply because you start challenging the local churches power).

    Edit: Don't forget the steam engine! (but that would be after some infrastructure in smelting already)

  So, last November, I wrote a thing for NaNo. It's 53kish words, and it's maybe 2/3 of the way to a first-draft-done state (entire plot-loadbearing scenes are just "TODO, this thing happens".)

  Finishing it would be a big investment of time. So I'm looking for alpha readers to let me know if there's enough *there* there to be worth finishing. Ideally what I'd like is people who love the idea and maybe also the voice (which owes some fealty to Graydon Saunders, I hate to admit) but are critical about the execution (especially on a big-picture/structural level).

  Elevator pitch: it's an urban fantasy novel set in November of 2020, but what it's about is what it means to have power and not be allowed to use it, what it's like to relearn how much there is to learn in the world, and how awesome people can be to get to know and learn to love, in all the ways people love each other.

  The MC is a married dude in his thirties. He, his wife, and their 1-year-old daughter are moving to San Francisco because they've had enough of Washington DC, and wind up staying in a group house with a bunch of wizards, a couple paladins, and a young woman who's actually an eldritch abomination.
