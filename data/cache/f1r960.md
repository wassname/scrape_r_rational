  As a professional translator this suggestion is making me weep blood. If you aren't familiar with fanfic etiquette, it goes like this:

  1. You contact the author. 2. Tell them that you really would like to read an English translation of their work. 3. Offer to do it yourself, if you have the competence. 4. Or maybe one of the author's fans translates it.

  The entitlement and sheer lack of disrespect for a profession and skill set is unreal here. Yikes.

  It’s copyright infringement and will end up garbling parts of the original story because Google translate isn’t perfect, as you’ve demonstrated in this post.

  It is really Word about the Dragon, because old Russian used "слово" as "tale". Google translate is awful. Smartcat has good engine, but you will need editing anyway. Good translation is hard and costly, your best bet is to find an interested bilingual fan.

  Not directly related but it's probably better to use [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/translator) rather than Google for machine translations. I find DeepL gives much better translations though I haven't tested it with Russian yet.

  If you actually go for it, try using DeepL. I haven't tried it for Russian, but in the languages I tested, it's way better than Google.

  Just my two cents: the title indeed means "A word about the dragon" - though, given that the dragon seems to be the narrator, "The Word of the Dragon" could be a valid adaptation (I haven't read it, so can't say much more).

  You could try asking for more information/suggestions in the Novel Updates forums?  Novel Updates hosts links to translated chapters of many fictions, largely Chinese and Japanese, and among which a good number of translations are similarly touched-up machine translations.  Quality varies.  In any case, presumably the people in their forums might be more familiar with the ethical, legal, logistical, and/or other aspects of this proposition?
