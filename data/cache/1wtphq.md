## Instead of just making a sidebar listing of The Great Rationalfics, I made us a TVTropes page

  Thank you for doing this, I don't know what we would do without you!

  Btw, I think you should put [The Last Christmas](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9915682/1/The-Last-Christmas) (originally by name The-Day-That-Santa-Stole-Christmas) in the other fics. It's written really well (although a bit short) and it uses all rational tropes fantastically.

    You know, you can edit TVTropes pages yourself. They're a wiki style site!
    ```

      ```
      Yeah, I remembered it just before you mentioned it! I already added it.
      ```

  It's a good page. I understand why there is currently such a heavy emphasis on fanfiction on the page, but do we expect that emphasis to fade with time, to the point where a more general page might be RationalFic**tion**? As an aspiring Fantasy author myself, I like to imagine everything above the Bonus Points section applies to my project.

    The point of having a Tropes page is for you guys to edit so I don't have to!

      So how do you rename a tvtropes page?

        I haven't the slightest clue.

  God I hate biz wiz.

    ```
    I assume you meant Wiz Biz, by Rick Cook.

    I really don't feel like Wiz Biz teaches any useful lessons at all, really - I mean, it has the trappings of computer science mixed with the trappings of magic, but overall it has basically no lessons to teach, and it isn't particularly well-written - basically, it has nothing to commend it to my attention as particularly rational, or even interesting.

    I don't hate it. It wasn't interesting enough to hate, or even feel strongly at all about. I just thought it was sort of 'blah'.
    ```

    - u/traverseda:
      ```
      It reads like, well, bad fanfictions. It's got a very marty stu primary character, and it doesn't have a fully realized magic system.
      ```
