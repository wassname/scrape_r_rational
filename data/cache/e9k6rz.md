      I think GP's solved it.  I recommend everyone spend 60 seconds thinking about the problem before revealing their spoiler text or mine below; it seems pretty solveable.

      > INPUT WHAT I LIKE BEST INTO ME AND WIN A GOLDEN TICKET

      >!The point is that what those people who are guessing want is not the same as what JUROR wants. Juror wants an empty canvas - and an empty <input> box is pretty much the same as an empty <canvas>.  /r/rational readers should be familiar with the artificial intelligence trope that defining one's desire precisely is nigh impossible - except for the null case, a malicious genie can always misinterpret.  No guess whether the prompt will accept "my coherent extrapolated volition" as a valid answer for everyone, though.!<

    I like him. The idea of someone who reads not out of love, but because hate is cheap and fueling in a different way, like some Anti-Matilda, is great.

    I am also fairly sure he's a Dio reference in some way- his portrayal here is too similar to S1E1 Dio's background of "Asshole waiting for guardian to die out of spite". I'm hoping it doesn't go to far, since I'm sick of Jojo references, tbh.

  First of all, hi Teddy! Glad you're feeling better.

  Second of all: r/rational seems to have been nerd sniped by the game, but nobody seems to have dug into the lore yet. 

  Charlie and the great glass elevator appears non-canon

  Zamboni apparently manufactures hypersonic transcontinental aircraft, and operating them is cheap enough that news agencies can use them.

  That reference to Wonka being secretly horribly racist but ultimately probably just an accident of statistics is probably a reference to how the oompa loompas were originally african pygmies, before they were changed to the orange things we know today.

  Apparently there were multiple attempts by corporations to secede from their parent nations. Urkel conquered Philidelphia? The fact that Wonka is a sovereign nation explains how they haven't had to deal with inspectors, and apparently they have enough power to enforce "And if anyone ever attempts to steal your ambrosian confections or in any way threaten your copacetic candy consumption, you may also call me and my delightful drones will proceed to erase them from the face of the earth." 

  There's probably stuff I missed, but that's just what jumped out to me reading it.

    Why? I imagine being personal friends with the POTUS could only help your corporate secession.
    ```

    - u/CreationBlues:
      ```
      Charlie and Wonka haven't been seen since he went in, except for when Charlie buried Wonka. On top of that, everyone has no fucking clue what is up with the factory. I feel like "Saving a space hotel from aliens" would be a rather notable development in the wonka/charlie saga, you know? 

      Possibly their involvement was covered up, but... how would all the rest of it be explained? People were rescued, the hotel was destroyed, aliens existed... there was a lot going on. People would talk, explanations had to be written. The great glass elevator is much less popular, and doesn't really add much to the whole "magic chocolate factory" angle, so there's not even much reason to include it.

        > Charlie and Wonka haven't been seen since he went in, except for when Charlie buried Wonka.

        They've made no official public appearances, or well-attributed private appearances; their presumptive off-screen dinner at the White House could have been kept quiet (at Wonka's request, I imagine). Both Charlie and Willy would have been fairly nondescript in normal clothes, so it's not like they had to *stay* locked up in the factory all the time. 


        >  People were rescued, the hotel was destroyed, aliens existed...

        Charlie did not know about the aliens; thus, they are probably a state secret. (I imagine that if aliens were not a state secret, they would be such common knowledge that everyone would recognize them). Same thing for the hotel in space.

        Honestly the whole sequence of events is nearly an anti-meme. "You're telling me that Willy Wonka, the chocolate guy, rescued the President from space aliens during a visit to his secret space hotel? Pull the other one, maybe I'll turn in to a Reptilian."

        The people who were rescued were on the POTUS' staff, and thus accustomed to keeping Top Secret stuff, you know, secret.

  Okay. Okay. 

  I don't want to presume. But is this in any way related to    Korridor? Game by God: Sludge somethingation? 

  ...is this the last chapter we will ever see?
  ```

  - u/gryfft:
    ```
    Fudge revelation? Sludge reformation? I don't know, you might be reading too far into this brand new Reddit account posting a story to this subreddit in particular with a brand new ff.net account and referencing, in-story, an artistic philosophy of incompleteness being a form of artistic expression in and of itself.

    I'm sure gazemaize isn't associated with or in any way referencing teddy_teddy_teddy, nope. Not at all.

        An author who once wrote stuff here deleted their webpage and all of their incomplete works. "Sludge Reformation" was part of the title of one of their stories.

      Don't forget the story focuses around an elimination game! We don't know what ship poster was gonna be about, but I do remember a lot of theories that it was gonna be a murder mystery.

      Edit: can't forget the absolutely batshit character design

    You know what, I thought the same. There is something of the same taste here. Especially the rhythm of the title. But I find I don't care. Sufficient pointwise delight provides a net gain even with critical lack of closure.

  Delicious friend! What flavourful ridiculousness! Dahl-essence, wielded with rational intent, such things this could be.

    billions of attempts have been made, you think all the *children* (only children can win) all lied and said they didn't qualify?

- u/PreFollower:
  ```
  Great read. I'll be waiting for more. I like the thing with geopolitics and contemporary references, main characters (two as of yet) seem to be pretty interesting.

  &#x200B;

  Most likely there is 6 different answers, and you can't use the same one twice. But I suppose first one was just blank, or something like that.
  ```

  - u/appropriate-username:
    ```
    It can't be generic blank answer for anybody because it's highly unlikely that the first person to have gotten it is someone who has a relationship with incompleteness. Tons of people probably tried leaving it blank, it's more likely that any of them would've gotten it.
    ```

    - u/PreFollower:
      ```
      Yes, more likely incomplete than blank.
      ```

  This is fantastic. I eagerly await the next update.

      No to mention the fact that chocolate is a pretty common "secret ingredient" in a lot of chili dishes.

    the secret ingredient in my chili is chocolate, actually. Shh, don't tell anyone.

  Does anyone think the puzzle will be solvable for the readers?
  ```

  - u/Silver_Swift:
    ```
    I suspect there isn't an actual answer, either Charlie picks the winners by hand or the contest is rigged in some other way. 

    The chapter mentions people trying to brute force it, so any solution that involves entering a (non-insanely-long) string into a textbox would have been found instantly and presumably a lot of clever people are trying out all the other obvious things that we could guess.
    ```

    - u/IICVX:
      ```
      I think we can safely assume that any website created by Wonka's heir operates on a "do what I mean (but with candy)" basis, so yeah the net effect is probably identical to Charlie picking people by hand.
      ```

  - u/eroticas:
    ```
    I don't think so, because if it was then the fictional public would have solved it. It's going to be something offbeat, like putting chocolate into the computer.
    ```

    - u/CouteauBleu:
      ```
      ... oh wow. And on the day the first chapter was posted, too.

      (makes you realize how improbable it is that nobody figure it out, even with an answer that stupid)
      ```

    - u/xamueljones:
      ```
      I don't know about that. In the Wonka movies and books, adults are often kinda condescending to kids and greedy.

      I wouldn't be surprised if the fictional public is less competent than in real life. It's also possible that there are adults who put in the right answer or tell it to the kids, but there's some magic that can tell if it's an adult or a kid who didn't figure out the answer themself.
      ```

- u/farsan13:
  ```
  Probably, the solution is >!Not writing anything at all!<.

  EDIT: Probably not, as one of the chatters mentioned a strategy probably more advanced than this.
  ```

  - u/osmarks:
    ```
    That would be pretty early in the list for things to try.
    ```

- u/cthulhusleftnipple:
  ```
  Chili will eventually enter the contest with the submission "chocolate", and be given a golden ticket for it.

  Dude(/tte). I want more.   Why isn't there more?
