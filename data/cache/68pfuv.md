  Gotta say, I don't really like the actual story MfD, just wasn't my thing, but oh boy are the titles that come up just really fun.

    Is it an issue with the genre/setting, or a particular issue with the writing? Us QMs always love getting feedback if you'd be willing to give it :)

      Alright, so I'd say mostly that I couldn't connect to the characters. It started In Media Res with the characters knowing each other, but without a build-up I just kept getting confused on who was who and their ranks and powers, because they felt like NPCs rather than people. Sure, they had characteristics unique to them, but they felt shallow and with one main character trait defining them.

        The characterization gradually developed over time and the readerships very much care about them now. 

        How many chapters did you read so far?

  People were saying we were never going to be strong enough to have an effect on the world.  And now we've just accidentally the Hokage.

    If Hazou could be half as effective on purpose as he is by mistake, he could rule the world.
    ```

      Yeah. Basically, at almost every turn, even the mission in *Hot Spring*, set up Mist to lose horribly, and Mist did.
      ```
