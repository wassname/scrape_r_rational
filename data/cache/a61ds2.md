## What other ongoing web serials, manga, or fanfiction you guys are religously following that the subreddit currently isn’t?

### Post:

It doesn’t have to be rational or even rationalist. I currently read and caught up with all the fiction that get posted here. Is there any other hidden gems out there?

### Comments:

- u/CeruleanTresses:
  ```
  Here's a few I follow:

  * [OOTS](http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0001.html) has already been mentioned. In essence, it's the story of a party of adventurers trying to stop a powerful lich from obtaining world-threatening macguffins in a setting loosely based on D&D mechanics, but that barely scratches the surface. It starts out as a gag-a-day strip but quickly develops an engrossing plot and a richly characterized ensemble. It has a lot of well-executed "wham moments" and brilliantly handled character development throughout. You don't need to be familiar with D&D or tabletop games to follow the plot, although it helps with getting some of the jokes.

  * [Unsounded](http://www.casualvillain.com/Unsounded/comic/ch01/ch01_01.html) is possibly the overall highest-quality webcomic I've ever read and also deals with some themes relevant to this sub. The complexity of the worldbuilding is extremely impressive (especially if you follow the creators' Tumblr, where she answers questions about background details that don't make it onto the page), and there's a really cool, consistent, fleshed-out magic system that functions similarly to computer programming. The premise is hard to summarize, but basically it's about a dead-ish man whose soul is trapped in his decaying body for reasons he doesn't understand, tasked with escorting the young daughter of a crime boss to a distant city, and...it kind of seems like the story will ultimately be about uncovering and comprehending the very underpinnings of reality? Time will tell. (Also, highly reliable 3-updates-per-week schedule.)

  * [Stand Still Stay Silent](http://www.sssscomic.com/comic.php?page=1) is a postapocalyptic story inspired by Finnish and Scandinavian folklore. It follows a band of misfits on an underfunded expedition to retrieve old-world books from the deadly Silent World, a region abandoned by humans after a global plague. It is not remotely rationalist, but has beautiful (or sometimes grotesque) art and rich characters. One of the main ensemble is autistic-coded, for those looking for representation (though the author has said he won't be officially diagnosed with anything in the comic). One "book" of this comic has been completed and the second one is in progress (4 updates a week). See also the creator's "practice comic," [A Redtail's Dream,](http://www.minnasundberg.fi/comic/page01.php) which is fantastic in its own right.

  * [Lackadaisy](https://www.lackadaisy.com/comic.php?comicid=1) is a Prohibition-era story of similar quality to Unsounded, but with a tragically much slower update schedule. It's about a speakeasy struggling to stay afloat admidst the dangerous schemes and shenanigans of the criminal underworld. Meticulously researched for historical accuracy, gorgeous sepia-toned art. Also the characters are all drawn like cats but I don't think they're actually canonically cats? You wouldn't think it would work, but it does.

  * A lesser-known one is [Doomsday My Dear](http://www.doomsdaymydear.com/comics/1735998/title/), which is about an an alt-universe UK where a mysterious plague paves the way for the rise of a totalitarian state. Kinda slow to update, but I love the art style and the characters feel very human.

  * [IT HURTS!!](http://gobolatula.com/ithurts/) is crude, bizarre, silly, sometimes offensive, and overall about as far as it gets from being rationalist. It's also one of the most sincere and relatable takes on depression and anxiety I've ever read, and did things to my emotions that I would never have anticipated, and it's somehow also consistently hilarious and the plot goes to some really fucking cool places. Give it a shot! (The characters use slurs in the beginning because they're shitty middle schoolers--if it bothers you a lot, start 60ish strips in, they decide to stop using them around that point. Also don't read the comments if you don't want spoilers.) This comic is complete, although there's a sequel comic which absolutely should not be read or even read *about* before reading IT HURTS!! in its entirety.

  * [Paranatural](http://www.paranatural.net/comic/chapter-1), currently on hiatus but returning Jan 1, is about a boy who moves to a new town and discovers that he can see spirits--and that his new school has a club for kids like him. The art and writing are really goddamn funny, and the character dynamics and conflicts are very well done and have caused me *a lot of feelings.*

  * [Strong Female Protagonist](http://strongfemaleprotagonist.com/issue-1/page-0/), currently on hiatus, is pretty close to rational compared to most of the others on this list. It's set in a world where a generation of kids developed superpowers a few years ago, and it follows a young Superman expy as she tries to, A., figure out how to do good effectively on a global scale when all she really excels at is punching things, and B., figure out what "good" actually *is*. Lots of lengthy ethical debates, occasional creative superpower use, exploration of the social-justice implications of superpowers.

  * [Kill Six Billion Demons](https://killsixbilliondemons.com/comic/kill-six-billion-demons-chapter-1/) is about an ordinary woman from Earth who is transported to a strange, alien place with a mysterious artifact embedded in her forehead. Before long she's making friends with angels and picking fights with some of the most powerful entities around. Cool art, very cool worldbuilding, lots of action. Sometimes the authors' notes contain excerpts from in-universe texts concerning history, folklore, religion, etc. 

  * In the world of comics that actually cost money, I've been following [The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl,](https://www.comixology.com/The-Unbeatable-Squirrel-Girl-2015/comics-series/33143) which is written by Ryan North of Dinosaur Comics. It's lighthearted and very funny, with a focus on finding diplomatic solutions to conflicts that satisfy everyone (and failing that, creative out-of-the-box solutions that use available resources in unexpected ways). Also lots of of philosophy and computer science jokes, and there's a graphic novel that's a fun take on the "utilitarian character tries to take over the world to impose a benevolent dictatorship" trope I see occasionally in rationalist fic.

        - u/CeruleanTresses:
          ```
          Given that you like those, I'd suggest Unsounded, Lackadaisy, and Paranatural as the first to try. Paranatural has a similar emphasis on the complicated interpersonal dynamics of an ensemble cast, Lackadaisy has the "band of misfits" thing going on, and Unsounded has an OOTS-like feeling of a vast world and expanding story-scope as well as an SSSS-like feeling of mystery. But of course you should dive into any that sound cool!

          - u/biomatter:

            Man what even the heck was "It Hurts!"? What a trip. I'm scared to go in to PFM, which looks sequel-ish.

            - u/CeruleanTresses:
              ```
              It's nuts, right? This was good timing for you to read it, because the final "special"--which I personally think is the perfect ending--is normally only available in the printed book. The author put it back up on the site temporarily for the holidays.

              PFM is a little different, and isn't very far into its own run, but I'm enjoying it so far.
              ```

              - u/biomatter:
                ```
                That is good timing! It was really sweet, and a wonderful piece to end on.

                One niggling thought that bothers me a little about the story is >!the "It's not fair" vibes. I really thought that would turn into the main story arc / moral somehow. I'm not trying to criticize the story though, because I think it says more about me than the author. It just... What happened *doesn't* seem fair! :((( sniff sniff !<
                ```

                - u/CeruleanTresses:
                  ```
                  Yeah, I think you're right-->!most of what happened really wasn't fair. But I guess we have to take [God's word](https://imgur.com/a2juCK4) on that subject.!<

                  >!The part that really kills me is knowing that since Pasqualo never double-died, Ally spent who knows how long in Hell not knowing where he was or what had happened to him, and probably eventually got incinerated by hellfire still not knowing. That and when I realized on rereading the comic that Aurora knew Pasq was going to sacrifice himself for her in the rebooted universe, and explicitly, desperately did not want him to do that, and died knowing she was helpless to prevent it.!<

                  On a more positive note, check out [the sketch I got in my copy of Book 6](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DlBppRLXgAAT4iq.jpg). Canon ending IMO. Freeze frame, roll credits.

  Ward (the sequel to Wildbow's Worm) is a hell of a basebreaker, but I'm in the "I love it" camp. For that matter, Worm is a hell of a basebreaker.

  But it's pretty consistently not brought up here, I think in part because of how contentious it is.
  ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    Well, there's also the fact that /r/parahumans is bigger than we are, and has a fairly substantial amount of overlap in terms of readers, so anyone who wants to talk about Worm or Ward will typically go there.

    You're right though, discussion does get a little heated at times.
    ```

    - u/PotentiallySarcastic:
      ```
      Parahumans is actually only a few thousand people bigger than this sub. It's two or three times more active however.
      ```

      - u/alexanderwales:
        ```
        It's not *that much* bigger, but they're all (or mostly) focused on that one story. The biggest serials posted here don't have the focus of the entire subreddit, only a fraction of it, and I know in some cases there are serials where readers only use this subreddit for that one specific story, and ignore everything else that ever gets posted here.

        So /r/parahumans is more active, true, but it's *also* more focused.
        ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Ward is contentious? The worst I've heard is people calling it boring and drawn out, which is par for the course for a Wildbow story (and also something that goes away with archive binging). And also that the worldbuilding was "implausible".
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      If you mainly liked Worm because Taylor was able to lverage her brilliant tactical mind and creatively use her (and other people's) power to solve absolutely hopeless situations, liking Ward isn't a given.

      The protagonist is a lot different in her mindset, her approach to PR, and in her combat style. Much more introspective, too.

      I love it, but Vicky isn't Taylor, and that drives people away.
      ```

      - u/Law_Student:
        ```
        I had an interesting conversation with Wildbow about that once. He made a sort of self-challenge out of deliberately writing himself into corners so he would be forced to find clever solutions to getting out of them. It's the sort of thing that takes guts - I'm not sure I'd be brave enough to do it in a web serial where I can't change what's been posted if I can't figure out a good solution - but it paid off really well for him.
        ```

    - u/PastafarianGames:
      ```
      Having a thing where any positive mention of it results in an argument about how much other people think [it's boring / it's drawn out / X character is so awful it ruins the story] qualifies as contentious, yes.
      ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      Ward is a solid step down from Twig which makes it much worse in comparison.
      ```

  [Dungeon Meshi](https://mangadex.org/manga/13871/dungeon-meshi), but I'm pretty sure most people on this sub already know of it even if it hasn't been mentioned yet.

  It has a nice rationalist bend on the ecosystem of a typical "Dungeon".

  - u/eaglejarl:
    ```
    I didn't.  Thanks for the link -- I like dungeon stories.

  [_The Order of the Stick_](http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0001.html) and [_Goblins: Life Through Their Eyes_](https://goblinscomic.com/comic/06252005) are the only regularly updated fiction I am following that don't get updates posted in this sub. Neither is particularly rationalist, although both make a point of deconstructing the Always Chaotic Evil trope as applied to goblins (in fact, _Goblins_ was one of the inspirations for [_The Sword of Good_](http://web.archive.org/web/20090907010946/http://lesswrong.com/lw/169/the_sword_of_good/) by Eliezer Yudkowsky).

  Personally, I'm pretty partial to [Marked for Death](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/marked-for-death-a-rational-naruto-quest.24481/), a rational Naruto quest over on SV.  It's written by a brilliant, talented, handsome author with (if I may say so) an absolutely lethal deadpan humor.  Oh, and me.

    I can totally unbiasedly +1 this. It's pretty good reading just a story, and \*really\* good if you get involved with the questing. (I primarily do the former, with spots of keeping up with the main thread when time allows)

  [The Wandering Inn.](https://wanderinginn.com)

   It has some rational parts but for the most part is very irrational. The basic premise is a country performs a ritual to summon [Heroes]. A side effect of that ritual is that various humans arrive all over a world where people have classes and skills but no stats. The main character Erin is one such human who stumbles upon an abandonded inn and becones it's  innkeeper. Adeventures ensues as she's forced to deal with adventurers, guards, friendly monsters and hordes of monsters. It's a stereotypical world where Humans, Drakes, Gnolls and the hive minded Antium are the principle races. There are also various mini stories that focus on other people dropped in to the world who generally have unique or rare classes like [Doctor], [Clown] or [Emperor].

  [The Legend of Randidly Ghosthound](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/11209/the-legend-of-randidly-ghosthound).

  A regular LitRPG where Earth is hit by the System which destroys civilisation and forced everybody to start over. Randidly becomes a reluctant hero when he is given the advantage of immediately being dumped in a high level time dilated dungeon when the System hits.

  [The Arcane Emperor](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/8463/the-arcane-emperor).

  Another LitRPG where the main character Rainer is a weak mage on Earth who while inventing a spell to walk through walls ends up in another world. The main character sets out to learn as much magic as possible using his new Arcanist class and the unknown Arcane magic type.

      I wasn’t discouraged by the beginning, I just lost steam. It’s hella long at this point. Things were picking up with some boney folks (vague to avoid spoilers) and I took a break and lost momentum to return
      ```

    - u/alexanderwales:
      ```
      I really wanted to like it, since the premise was interesting, but the writing didn't do it for me, and I gave it what I felt was a fair shake (seven chapters or so). Does the writing improve? And when does the story pick up or become worth reading, if not in the first chapters?
      ```

      - u/gbear605:
        ```
        Where it is now, ~200 chapters in, the writing is amazing. Getting through the first thirty or so is definitely somewhat difficult though, but it is worth it.
        ```

      - u/Gr_Cheese:
        ```
        There's a side story that I've recommended to people, which is recent enough to showcase the author's improvements, but far enough removed from the main story to avoid spoilers. This is the non-aquatic [Doctor] sidestory: https://wanderinginn.com/2017/07/14/1-00-d/

        Apologies for the necro'd response, but I really do think the story is worth the read.
        ```

      - u/Cuz_Im_TFK:
        ```
        I personally read 30 chapters, then lost interest. I stopped a little while after the running girl was introduced. Someone else may have a different answer, but while I think the story \*did\* get a bit better after the first 8 chapters, it never really got good \*enough\*.
        ```

    - u/Olivedoggy:

      I got discouraged during the second dungeon run, when I realized that the author had an allergy to their characters getting a victory.

  - u/SoupedUpToaster:
    ```
    +1 to The Arcane Emperor.  Main character is quite grey and is purely after the best magic.  It is LitRPG so if you dont like that stay away, but if you do like LitRPG and you like magic then you should give it a shot
    ```

- u/signspace13:
  ```
  [The legend of Randidly Ghosthound](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/11209/the-legend-of-randidly-ghosthound) is a series I follow rather religiously, I'm a $10 patron on the authors patreon mostly because his patreon reward is like 60+ chapters more reading, and discussion in his Discord. It's a very fun series that is a great example of the Litrpg Genre, with a very interesting take on the 'system' that is present in such series, mostly as it's system is both working towards its own goals and actively Malicious. The MC is rather fun, as he is the opposite of what most Litrpg MCs are, he is awkward, impatient, antisocial and just generally a loner, and stays that way, improving without changing these core aspects. It's a fun series, if you like it's genre.

  [Metaworld Chronicles](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/14167/metaworld-chronicles) another series that is just plain fun. It's a bit of a self insert fiction in which the Main character, previously a successful business woman in Sydney 2017, is drawn into the body of an alternate universe version of herself that exists in 2001, a the world has magic and monsters, ruled of by the mages that are the only hope of fighting back the existential threats to mankind. I like this series partial for its endearing character, it's initial Australian setting (an uncommon setting, and welcome for an Aussie),  it's unquiet and entertaining implementation of D&D magic as its magic system, with great restrictions and interesting variations, and a rather well thought out and explained alternate history.

  I wouldn't consider either of these to be rational *or* rationalist at all, but I very much enjoy them, and they are the main series I wait for each week.

    If you are a fan of The legend of Randidly Ghosthound, I am going to plug my own recently started LitRPG, [Esper: Search for Power](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21353/esper-search-for-power) as another story you may like.

    I read randidly until that wild, out-of-the-blue shift to xianxia. Does it ever come back to litrpg, if so is it any good and if so what chapter?
    ```

    - u/signspace13:
      ```
      It does, the time on the 'spear world' (later revealed to be called Tellus) is a bit of a hard turn into that Genre, but Xianxia was always one of the major inspirations of the series, and I feel like it fits well with the system and it's methods, as all the system in LoRG is, is an interface that controls the progression of 'cultivators' under it's influence towards its own ends, it takes that turn because Randidly sees through that and tries to work past the system, which as I said, is actively Malicious.
      ```

    - u/Twitters001:
      ```
      You mean when he travelled to the spear world? Yeah it does shift back away from that, although quite a while later. The "cultivation" aspects are toned down a lot and portrayed more as just a consequence of gaining power.

  [Witch Hat Atelier](https://mangadex.org/manga/20723/witch-hat-atelier) (mild self promotion disclaimer): a seemingly-lighthearted classic high fantasy story with gorgeous western-inspired art. None of the characters are strictly rational, but their goals and motivations are presented in a strongly realistic and compelling light, especially the antagonists'. Not a lot written right now, but what's there is extremely captivating.

  [The Last Angel](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-last-angel.244209/#post-9354450):  a more or less rational-adjacent original sci-fi story that has an enjoyable and believable take on A.I. and how governmental bodies deal with them, among many other plot threads of political intrigue, war games, and character drama. Complete with an ongoing sequel.

  Lastly, [Man Off the Moon](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/man-off-the-moon-fate-extra-x-mass-effect.641011/): an ongoing Mass Effect+Fate Stay/Night crossover. I've always been a sucker for the fic premise of "Shirou Emiya wanders into someone else's plot and promptly derails it", and this scratches that itch quite nicely. Rewards a deep knowledge of both series' lore, but still introduces everything well enough you can go in blind.

  The story is of Kitano Seiichirou, a very kind and pure-hearted young man, with a horrifying, monstrous face. People being what they are, they think he's a terrifying delinquent, and there are plenty of chance misunderstandings (coupled with Kitano's convenient inability to understand what's happening around him) that propel him into the position of "school guardian", a.k.a. head thug on campus.

  I know it's older, but just in case some of you haven't seen it: [Darths and Droids](http://www.darthsanddroids.net/episodes/0001.html)

  I'm re-reading it and thought I'd share. The concept is "What if the Star Wars movies were actually a group of tabletop gamers, playing and arguing with the DM?" It's really funny.

  No mention of [Deathworlders](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheJenkinsverse) yet?

  Hard Sci-Fi story set in the near future in a universe where humans are about the strongest of the intelligent species, but helplessly behind in technology. Focusses primarily on a core set of characters, but dabbles in basically all genres: Horror, sci-fi opera, romance, detective stories, military fiction...

  Accompanying the main work (~1 million words) are various fan creations, some of which have attained canon status, and saw characters incorporated into the main story. That's why I linked the story on TVTropes, where a rough reading list can be found.

  Check out [Schlock Mercenary](https://www.schlockmercenary.com/) - the author Howard Tayler could not find an artist to illustrate his stories so he picked up drawing from scratch initially, so the art is atrocious in the early books but progressed nicely all along since. It's extremely well written, in that protagonists and antagonists all have believably reasonable lines of thinking and credible motivations, the shattering effects of disruptive technology are very much explored and not downplayed (lifespan extension, teleportation, uplifting, mass-duplication, AI singularity, etc. are mainstays of the worldbuilding).

  It has racked up several Hugo nominations, and is also notable for never once having missed its daily update in its 18 years of publishing, not even when [the datacenter hosting it exploded](https://tech.slashdot.org/story/08/06/01/1715247/explosion-at-theplanet-datacenter-drops-9000-servers), caught fire and was subsequently flooded.

  Check out the "monthly recommendation thread" posts. People post large and well explained lists there. The most recent one looks like it was an active one too.

  Here's two other tips:
   To find longer/completed works look at older recommendation threads, since they will have had time to get long or wrap up by now.
  I also recommend checking out the fanfiction/fictionpress favorites of some of the great authors here, since they also tend to have good general tastes even outside their works. Like Alexanderwhales, EY, and Daystareld off the top of my head.

  I love [Dr. Stone](https://myanimelist.net/manga/103897/Dr_Stone). It's not strictly speaking rational probably but still plenty of fun - taking all the tropes of shounen manga and applying them to a genius science-savvy kid trying to rebuild civilisation in a post-apocalyptic scenario in which mankind has been knocked back to the Stone Age. 

  I also love [Kaguya-sama, or Love Is War](https://myanimelist.net/manga/90125/Kaguya-sama_wa_Kokurasetai__Tensai-tachi_no_Renai_Zunousen), which is absolutely not rational, but if you're looking for extremely funny and occasionally sweet romantic comedies, well, you couldn't really possibly do any better. Ballin'.

  Too many to list, but here's just a few:

  [Everybody Loves Large Chests](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/8894/everybody-loves-large-chests)
  One of my favorite webnovels, be warned however that it is *extremely* NSFW. 

  Best to read it without spoilers, just try and make it through the first chapter and you should pretty much immediately be hooked. But here's a more detailed description, for you to read after finishing chapter one. 

  It's about a >!mimic!< who, mostly through sheer luck, >!becomes sentient. It is, however, still fundamentally a monster- as such it lives only to fulfill it's utility goals of "Acquire Shiny Things" and "Eat Tasty Things". Get's more interesting the longer you read it, though I can't really say how without spoiling it. Let's just say that he won't be satisfied staying in the starting dungeon forever...!<

  [The Erogamer](https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/the-erogamer-original.5465/)

  The best quest-type story I've ever read, not counting Homestuck. This actually is brought up on this subreddit sometimes, but not often. A lot of readers are scared off by needing an account to access the site. Anyway, it's about a girl on the verge of suicide, who one day gains typical "The Gamer" style abilities, but the twist is that it's locked into the genre of "Erogame", meaning that everything sort of revolves around sex. 

  [Not The Hero](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/217108/not-the-hero)

  Man, I don't even like MLP. But with that said, this is still one of my favorite stories. It's basically a "Human in Equestria" story, but the human in actually a villain, and the longer they spend in this world, the more it resembles their shitty fannon. Discord, spirit of disharmony and chaos, decides he has to do something about it. The story itself is basically his journal, chronicling his attempts to fight this living Mary Sue. 

  [COOL AND NEW WEB COMIC](https://mspfa.com/?s=14113&p=1)

  The best Homestuck fan comic in existence. I know it seems kinda boring at first, and that it seems like you get the joke, but I *BEG* you to at least read up to Rose's introduction before judging it. 

  [Re:Trailer Trash](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21322/re-trailer-trash)

  A story about a girl sent back in time, who resolves to live a better life than the one she had originally. MC is ridiculously competent, but in a good way, rather than a Mary Sue sort of way. Kind of inspired me to try and exercise more, actually...

  [The Dungeon Traveler](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21368/the-dungeon-traveler)

  Generic, but fun. It's your run of the mill "MC is a living dungeon" type of story. The gimmick is that the dungeon teleports to new locations all the time. Kinda underselling it here, but I can't think of anything else to say about it...

  EDIT: AAAAAAH! I forgot!

  [Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9911469/1/Lily-and-the-Art-of-Being-Sisyphus)

  I have no idea how to describe this! Or how to recommend it! All I can really say is, this is the most... *unique* Harry Potter fanfic in existence.
  ```

- u/Cuz_Im_TFK:
  ```
  * [Everybody Loves Large Chests](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/8894/everybody-loves-large-chests) is fantastic. Hilarious story about a selfish, man-eating, shape-shifting monster with completely different values from humans. A lot of good jokes, great narrative voice, and excellent prose, so it's really well-written. Also follows a lot of the writing conventions /r/rational is particular about: always in-character characters, no idiot ball, Magic A is magic A, etc.
  * I'm usually reading whatever [Andur](https://www.royalroad.com/profile/3091/fictions) is writing at any given time too. He has a bunch of completed stories. Definitely not rational, but all very fun.
  * I also follow Forty Millenniums of Cultivation. It is (used to be?) a bit more rational than any other eastern fantasy novels, but even if it's gotten more and more far-fetched and ridiculous lately, it's still enough fun to keep me reading.

  and is at something like a million and a half words over the three threads it's been on. Quest that i would say is about as rational as you're gonna find being made up of the continuity snarl that is the digimon canon. Very much an action-y battles type thing, might not be your thing.

  Destiny of Strife a bleach quest that updates a couple times a week and is a quest on sufficient velocity here [https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/a-destiny-of-strife-a-hollows-quest-bleach.29076/](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/a-destiny-of-strife-a-hollows-quest-bleach.29076/) 

  again another action-y battles type thing with a decent if irregular focus on character interactions.

  &#x200B;

  The tales of Paul Twister has that kind of dropped into a fantasy world and tries to uplift it kind of thing it updates sporadically at best but has a very well thought out world building type thing. does the action and is kind of adjacent to the whole worth a candle fic that usually reviews well here.

  Life ore death a mistborn/young justice crossover that has a feruchemist>!w/atium misting spike !<that I just love for the way that the Main character is very orange/blue with the more traditionally morals-ed cast.

  Olivine Romance on Ao3 uhhh this one is a little more explicit in the sexual sense so uhh heads up if that's not your cup of tea. but it's a pokemon fanfic based on Jasmine the steel gym leader from johto it rather recently started into it's second book so minus it being a huge mass of writing now is a great time to start reading it lol.

  Currently, the manga subreddit is going crazy over Solo Leveling.  Nothing innovative, but the execution of the story and art is pretty good.

  Outside of web stuff, I continue to religiously wait for the Cradle series by Will Wight. 5 books (out of potentially 12+) are out and the author has been releasing them about every 6 months.

  I'm reading [Appetite](https://www.lezhin.com/en/comic/appetite), because I am complete garbage for weird romances and Appetite is a slow-burn love story between a cannibal monster and a suicidal teen who has agreed to be eaten once he's a little older and will be a more magically potent meal, so that his death will mean something. As somebody who once agreed to give bone marrow 90% because it was the right thing to do and 10% out of the faint hope that something might go wrong and I'd die in a way that seemed less wasteful than outright suicide, it's really easy to identify with the latter character's headspace. 

  It...kind of changes tracks later on and isn't entirely what I was hoping it would be, but it doesn't take much of a time investment from me so I'm willing to keep reading in order to see how it all ends.

  If you have access to normal comics, either at a local shop or online or through a scan site, then you may also like **Dwarves**. Each issue is 60-70 pages long and follows the life (or part of the life) of, uh, a dwarf. The issues stand on their own feet but where the series *really* shines is in the way that it becomes a multigenerational epic. Several protagonists have been the children of protagonists from previous issues, and other protagonists have reappeared in supporting roles. There are two other series in the same setting, *Orcs & Goblins* and *Elves*, but I found the writing and stories to be far worse and no longer follow them. 

  You may also enjoy **Uber** and **Uber: Invasion**, a WWII/superpowers comic. In the early months of WWII, it turns out that Germany was working on a way to give people (very specific) superpowers. This is sufficient to turn the tide of the war *temporarily*, but they had a mole who was able to get some of the relevant information out to the Allies, who begin producing their own supersoldiers, and the fact remains that Germany is still on its last economic leg, which is posing its own problems. The comic makes no effort to shy away from the more gruesome aspects of war (as the writer, Kieron Gillen, mentions in one of his afterwords, war is a horror story and war *with superpowers* would be even more so). Murphy's Law is in full effect and plans go right just about as often as you'd expect them to. Finally, the narration appears to be sourced from a history book (or several) from some time after the war, though we aren't given the title (or titles). 

  My last recommendation is **The Black Monday Murders**, a noir/horror series by Jonathan Hickman. In the Mormon temple ceremony, Satan is explicitly linked to capitalism, and money is the means by which Satan "rules with blood and horror." Jonathan Hickman is not a Mormon and Mammon is more an ancient god than a Christian demon, but the underlying theme remains: black magic requires human sacrifice, and capitalism with all its excesses is the means by which this is carried out in the modern day, with the occasional detour into sacrifices of the more conventional kind (early in the first issue, we find out that the bankers and brokers who supposedly committed jumped out of windows during the Wall Street Crash of 1929 did not commit suicide, but were thrown out to keep the magical consequences of the crash from hitting the people at the very top). 

  It is the only time that you will see someone pay a dreadful price to ask questions of a god, and ask something as banal as "What causes a market crash?"

  I am reading [Now You Feel Like Number None](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/now-you-feel-like-number-none-bleach-arrancar-quest.37531/) and I love it.

  It's a very well-written, story-driven Bleach quest about an arrancar in Aizen's army. Updates tend to be long and frequent.

  (Bleach's worldbuilding for those unfamiliar:
  The standard-destination afterlife is a dimension called "soul society". It is a conservative feudal-japan oligarchy with vast slums. The ruling class is sequestered into a walled district with its own army of ghost samurai wizards - "shinigamis". Individual shinigami vary vastly in strength. The strongest few are granted the title of "captain" and their individual physical power actually constitutes the real power of all of soul society. Three of these captains have defected with plans to supplant the withdrawn "soul king", who is isolated in another inaccessible dimension.

  To achieve this, they have subjugated a third dimension, "Hueco Mundo", populated by strange, twisted ghosts - "hollows". Hollows are driven by a constant hunger to consume other souls. The invading captains have removed this hunger from the hollows they conquered by spiritual surgery and turned them into something more human and more usable as soldiers in the process - "arrancars". The quest follows one such arrancar as she tries to get by in a society created for the sole purpose of fighting a single war.)
