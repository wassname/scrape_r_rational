## [D] Monday General Rationality Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics!  Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world?  Have you:

* Seen something interesting on /r/science?
* Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
* Figured out how to become immortal?
* Constructed artificial general intelligence?
* Read a neat nonfiction book?
* Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?

  so, a while ago charles stross had a talk about how [companies are paperclip maximizers](http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2018/01/dude-you-broke-the-future.html). stross is a scottish author of transhuman spy fiction. 

  this is a simplification, but a reasonable one. so, you want them to cure cancer and give you immortality. they want money, and there has been noise about how [there may be more money in not curing people](https://www.iflscience.com/health-and-medicine/goldman-sachs-says-curing-diseases-may-not-be-economically-valid/). 

  so, as big companies are the only ones who can leverage the resources needed to solve for immortality, and they also have strong incentives not to cure you, why do we expect them to do so? our theory of mind for big corporations is simply wrong. the first type of way to modify corporate behavior is regulation, but this is hard to do with lots of negative externalities hiding in the weeds. 

  on the other hand, your government is its own maximizer for political power, with an externality of your quality of life. when people vote themselves money, bad things happen- look at [venezuela](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-economy/venezuela-annual-inflation-tops-1-million-pct-in-november-congress-idUSKBN1O91WT).

    Remember that companies are controlled by people. So diseases that can effect them and their relatives and loved ones will more often than not get cured. Diseases that don't won't. 

    &#x200B;

    A simple example is malaria, it doesn't affect most first world countries, so the cure hasn't been found yet and believe me there's been more than enough time for them to find a cure for it, just not enough incentive.

    &#x200B;

    Immortality is also desirable for the people controlling said companies and conglomerates, so it's fair to assume they are properly motivated to get it working as soon as they can.

    &#x200B;

    Be jaded if you want, just remember companies aren't actors, they are controlled by people, be they owners, CEOs, or stakeholders. And those people want similar things you want, safety and less suffering for their families and themselves included.

    Companies also compete with each other. Here it is one situation where Moloch is helpful. The first to invent a slightly better cancer treatment should get much more customers. Then they compete their own market into oblivion, sacrificing overall value (here: money) for a slight comparative edge over the competition.
