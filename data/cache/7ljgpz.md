  ```
  I have now posted five chapters of Dr Stone. Do people here think I should stop or keep posting updates?
  ```

  - u/WadeSwiftly:
    ```
    Iâ€™d vote for keep posting updates.
    ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    I appreciate you posting updates. I would eventually find them elsewhere, but seeing them on my reddit feed is convenient.
    ```

  - u/Draykon:
    ```
    I've been reading them as they come out, and it's certainly more convenient than having to check the readme.net page every day.
    ```

  - u/alliteratorsalmanac:
    ```
    Please continue to do so.
    ```

  - u/Charlie___:
    ```
    I think you should stop.
    ```

  That last panel, lewd.
