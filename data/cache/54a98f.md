## [HSF][RT] Starwhisp

### Post:

[Another of my short stories.](https://www.dropbox.com/s/n2huyv4pale3of2/Starwhisp.pdf?dl=0) Humanity's first interstellar mission is abruptly cut short by an unexpected encounter. A hard sci fi short story about values dissonance. What do you think?

  Very well written. Reminds me of Larry Niven's work. And chilling. Though it wasn't clear why the aliens hadn't discovered Sol system yet. Haven't they finished exploring the network ?

    The Iktotch genuinely don't care about expansion or exploration. They have a map of the network from some previous species but they haven't gone further than Tau Ceti because they only colonise new star systems when one group fissions due to civil war and strikes out for new territory. That's why it's taken them 15,000 years just to get that far.

      I see. I thought the expansion was implied in being a r-selected species. I'll have to think through the evolutionary game theory implications. Would definitely like to see more stories in this universe, even if it makes me sad.
      BTW, Have you read Niven's *Mote in God's Eye* ?  One of my favorites, and quite similar in theme to your story. Worth reading.

      Sorry for nitpicking (just means I like the story) . How exactly did the aliens detect the message transmission back to Earth, if it was a directional laser? I would think a message laser can't be detected unless receiver was directly in its path. On the other hand, a non directional radio transmission if strong enough could also transverse the unknown wormhole back to Sol system far more quickly than any laser, since that's only a billion km away ( assuming it didn't attenuate to noise by the time the signal reached it)
      ```

      And if you're wondering why the Iktotch achieved spaceflight **only**  15,000 years before humans, which is still an instant in galactic history, all I can say is the explanation will show up in a later story.

        I hadn't, though I really should have.

  I don't really get why they surrendered at first but then changed their minds. I mean, being conquered by others and forced to do things they don't like is already pretty normal to them, no? If anything, the only consequence of being conquered by humans is that they will have to do weird shit and have a much bigger chance of becoming independent conquerors again since humans are so dumb as to give their slaves all kinds of freedoms.

  And do all the attacking forces belong to K’txl? Otherwise, what made them all suddenly cooperate to stop the humans? In fact I already find it weird that K’txl is speaking for all of the factions and is willing to send so much of her army to stop humans even though it will definitely open her up to be conquered by many more overlords.

  Lastly, why was K’txl physically at the front of her expedition? I guess if you think you're alone in the universe (species wise) then being the first to get away from another planet in civil war actually makes you safer.
