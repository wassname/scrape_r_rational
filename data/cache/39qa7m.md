## Get a Beta Reader / Be a Beta Reader

### Post:

It isn't too hard to find a good Beta Reader in general (or at least it hasn't in my experience), but for writing rational/ist fic it can be a little harder. 

I was thinking about doing this already, but now that weekly writing contests are going to be a thing, I think that there might be an interest in a general "Beta Reader / Writer Match-Up" thread. 

If you're interested in being a Beta Reader for a story, then say what sort of things you're interested in working on, and anything else that might be relevant. 

If you're interested in finding a Beta Reader for your story (or for a series of stories, if this is for the writing contest), then talk about what you're writing or planning on writing. 

Or, you know, do whatever you think will be most effective. >:]

  I'm getting ready to restart writing "S.I.", the first part of which is at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AU8o3wSAiufh-Eg1FtL-6656dNvbCFILCi2GbeESsb4/edit , and I can still use all the beta-ing I can get. In case you haven't caught previous posts on it, it's RST, HSF, attempted-MK, and TH: A cryonicist wakes up after the Singularity, gets stuffed into a new body, and tries to deal.

  (Before I start writing new story, one of my preliminary tasks is, in fact, going to be catching up on on the betas' comments and suggestions that have built up while I was not up to writing.)

    Was this the one where everyone lives in rural areas because anything remotely urban now consists entirely of hegemonizing swarms?

      Close; it's the one where something like that happened, but a lot of said swarms have stopped working, leaving a whole lot of messiness to be dealt with by the rural survivors.
      ```
