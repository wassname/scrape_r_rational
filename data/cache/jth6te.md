## [D] Friday Open Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could (possibly) be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.

  In case other folks miss Elemental Arena as much as I do, here's an update from the author from the comments on the latest chapter on RoyalRoad. Posted 16 days ago: 

  >Mini update:

  >I wanted to let everyone know I have finished editing chapters 1 through 16 for book one and the new versions have been updated.  I am currently editing chapter 17.

  >I had to take a break for a couple months mainly due to issues with my personal schedule rather than anything book related. But I am back working again as of a couple weeks ago. In fact, taking a break has been helpful since I'm now looking at the material with fresh eyes and able to see the material more objectively.

  >As for the first sixteen edited chapters, I have reduced the book count from 670 to 640 pages. Most authors I have talked with say they do a 10% cut during editing, and so far I am close to doing similar. Cutting extraneous words, redundant sentences, pointless musings, etc. really adds up. Additionally, I combined/cut a few scenes that were repetitive. My hope is that this will vastly improve the reading experience, plus it has been a really good learning experience for me as a writer.

  >As for plot changes, nothing major has changed and the stats have been left untouched. But a few of the character arcs have been tweaked, most notably in my scaling back of the romantic tension between Nathan and Maya in the early scenes. I have long felt my execution was totally off in that area, and I am a lot more satisfied with things evolving more naturally now. Iliya's name has been changed to Illiana as well. I have received a lot of feedback from readers, and in places where I agreed, I have made some adjustments.

  >So for now, I am finishing up the editing for the last nine chapters and then I will switch back to working on book two. Thanks!

    Thanks for the update. I've been checking that story a couple times a week since the hiatus, hoping for more. It's a little disheartening knowing it's still going to be a while, but I'm glad he can maintain momentum. 

    I've also been waiting a long time on solomans crucible, but the author is working on a whole different story right now. So who knows how long that will be?

  What is the optimal course of action in the event that you find yourself with really dangerous knowledge, say, while playing around in you kitchen you find an easy and cheap way to produce large quantities of pure plutonium-239, or something else equally absurdly powerful?
  ```

  - u/SvalbardCaretaker:
    ```
    The accepted answer for specialist knowledge is: start conspiracy to avoid anyone looking for it like the human physicists in "three worlds collide".   If its so obvious that it'll be discovered again very soon by peers, you'll have to coordinate a moratorium, like real human biologists have done on certain forms of research. 

    If its so obvious and easy to do by laypeople that it'll be all over the internet next week, take up as much credit as you can and emergency buy a prepper bunker in the Rocky Mountains.

    - u/Weerdo5255:
      ```
      Unless I'm missing the blindingly obvious, biologists of good standing hold a moratorium on genetically modifying already lethal virus, causing pain and suffering for little expected value for all creatures, modifying human's in the womb, and cloning humans. With those last two perhaps not being a hard rule. 

      Or am I missing something else that they refuse to touch? I'm not on the up and up with bio-medical research except where it intersects with cybernetics and BCI.
      ```

      - u/SvalbardCaretaker:

        There's also the one to prevent green goo scenarios. As a community rule,  new or modified bacteria etc are supposed to get very strict dietary requirements built in so that they can't reproduce outside of the lab. For example artifical amino acids. 

        And research into actively dangerous parts of biology seems to have stopped on its own a decade or so back.  Might be a couple others I can't think of right now.

      If the cat was out of the bag that hard, would we be able to justify nuclear-powered space flight? Easy energy for Luna/Mars/Europa/belt colonization? Generation ships within a generation? More mundanely, less concern for the radioactive byproducts and nuclear risks associated with otherwise-clean nuclear power (even avoiding the mining and refining processes)?

      So, while panic-buying your bunker, maybe you need to consider which world-class leader(s) you would try to onboard somehow with your clearly crank cockamamie scheme.

        If the cat was out of the bag that hard - I once read an ooold SciFi story about kitchen table atomic bombs made of lead - that'd be it for humanity. Fin. No encore. 

        The timescale to even refurbish/restart the basically finished [NERVA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NERVA) rocket program, not to mention starting viable colonies is just too long. 

        Kitchentable super AIDS or kitchentable lead atomic bombs give us a span measured in years.

    Consider the odds that someone else has *already* figured this out. It's easy and cheap, right? Then it can't be *that* hard to stumble across.

    .....

    Then it's time to have a good, long think about things, looking for evidence of *who* else has figured this out (ideally without letting anyone else know the secret).

  Is anyone else upset/disappointed by how many people give up on things by default? Where people encounter a challenge, find it difficult or fail, then take away from it that they can't do it in the future? 

  The biggest one's that bother me are "physical" such vacations with walking or stairs and when people are moving houses. They realize that these things have gotten harder for them over time and just decide by default that they need to avoid them in the future. I understand if they think it's not worth the hassle or the time, but these are usually things where a small amount of preparation would make them easy and would improve your life. I can't imagine not being able to walk several flights of stairs, several miles, or move my stuff out of a house and not trying to regain those abilities if it's reasonable. It especially grates on my nerves since there are people older and physically disadvantaged that can do all of these things. Maybe it's because I'm relatively young but if something is difficult but necessary or enjoyable I try to figure out how to make it easier, not how to avoid it entirely. Or especially if I think something would be enjoyable if it wasn't so difficult. Those ones bother me the most, but I also encounter this with people who are "just bad at things" like "computers" even when they have to use them all the time. I've learned it doesn't help to voice this opinion, even with friends and family, since it makes them feel judged and I won't change their minds.

    It is some cultural thing.  I have seen some explinations of dubious quality about it.

    I used to do a bit of powerlifting and strongman and stuff. Not evenough to even think avour competition  or whatever. Max half hour a day right. Withour fail whenever I moved anything in the wild people would would be both shocked and awed.  

    I was just starting to get back into it before covid, I got some lung scarring from it and it fucked me up.  I definitely Have gound the appeal of just veging and not doing stuff. So i am fighting to get momentum  back.


    Still, I am working on it and I should be able to pick up big furnitre again pretty soon.

        just some asthma type stuff.  I didn't get that sick really, but then I developed a secondary pneumonia and a nasty cough.  Took months clear out.  The lung damage is generally managed with an inhaler.  it is a change of pace but manageable.  probably will heal up in a year or two.  My spouse got it to, she was sicker than me, but she didn't have any appearance of long term side effects.  We got it from a friend through his kid looks like.  I managed to hide away enough not to spread it to other members of the household.  Given the range of presentations I think I got through fine.

    Agreed about physical activity; I could basically *watch* my grandparents whither away after they gave up bicycling. I often find myself thinking how long they might've lived yet if we'd had electronic bicycles back then, to extend their active period.

    That said I've given up on plenty of instruments, sports, and games because I recognized that to have fun with them, I'd need to be way better. Why spend my brief free time on those, when there are other sports and games without that requirement?

    I always espouse the 'hacker' ethos towards problem solving that I've found helps with this. A lot of the time people give up because they grasp some amount of the technical breadth an issue has, and the effort needed to acquire the domain knowledge to properly solve the problem. Train yourself to see it as a personal challenge. 

    From the hacker point of view though, not even within the domain of computer science, the issue is tackled in a (to the individual solving the problem) logical progression of hypothesis, test, fail, repeat until a workable solution is found. It's by no means the best solution, proper solution, or efficient solution, but it does work. 

    Keep hacking away at the components of a system and eventually an even greater understanding of a given domain is acquired compared to a traditional approach as it's not all wrote memorization and basic troubleshooting to draw on, but a complex understanding of the problem. 

    This approach does have the disadvantage of making the understanding of a problem very individualistic. With logical shortcuts relevant only the hacker understands, [much to the dismay of anyone attempting to work with them.](https://xkcd.com/1513/) Still I prefer it as it grants a greater personal understanding, as well as the feeling of accomplishment with regards to figuring out how something works. 

    Also, don't apply this learning method to anything involving high tension springs, electricity, or delta-p.

  A bit late to the Friday party now, so I might try again later this week (if I remember) and hope for better traffic.

  But I thought it might be worthwhile to create a document summarizing a bunch of knowledge that could be useful for writing a character with the power of Aerokinesis.  Here is the outline that I've thought up so far:

  * Gases – State of Matter (ideal gas law, etc.)
  * Atmosphere – Composition; Pressure & Temperature; Layers
  * Wind – Wind Speed (definitions and measurement); Wind Power.
  * Weather – Other aspects of.
  * Biology – Respiration
  * Geomorphology – Aeolian processes and features.

  What do you guys think?  Any constructive thoughts and feedback, or emotionally-withering criticism?

  P.S.:  Is there a way to do sub-bullets in Reddit?  I don't see anything about it in the formatting help.

  What's the rational choice?

  An intruder, with similar height/weight/physique to yourself, has broken into your home. You and him are in a windowless room; you with a wall behind you and him with a door (the only entrance/exit to the room) behind him. You don't have your phone with you. Your family/roommates/whoever are gone for the day and your neighbors are on vacation, so yelling/screaming is pointless and the intruder also knows this. The intruder has a knife, of the kitchen knife variety, and he does not have good intentions. An altercation is inevitable and unavoidable. For a weapon, you have the option of a knife similar to his or a bat/golf-club. You can only choose one. Which is the rational choice?
  ```

  - u/jtolmar:
    ```
    Bat or golf club over a knife, every time. It has a reach advantage, it has a leverage advantage, and it's more likely to produce a fight-ending injury like a concussion or broken bone, rather than a random laceration, which is medically pressing but not instantly debilitating. By the time knife injuries matter, the fight will have already devolved into a wrestling match for control over the knife, regardless of who started with it. This still applies if you're not trained in martial arts - some sort of long stick is more likely to convert frantic flailing into a fight-ending injury than a knife is.

    This was actually a recurring topic back when I studied martial arts. Across a bunch of disparate arts, everyone ranks options something like talking it out, calling for help / running away, martial arts knowledge, a stick, pepper spray, a heavy object, a gun, untrained fists, a knife. There's wiggle room, but the primacy of avoiding a fight and admonishment that knife fights are a bad idea were recurring themes.
    ```

  - u/Kishoto:
    ```
    A bat and golf club are fairly different weapons; if I had the bat, I would choose that over a knife for simple reach purposes.
    ```

  - u/CCC_037:
    ```
    A bat. Definitely. It has a reach advantage, it can be gripped and wielded anywhere (making it easier to pick up if dropped), and it can be used without worrying about which side of it you're hitting with.

    .....

    ...mind you, I'd be yelling *as well*. It's probably going to be ineffective (except psychologically) but it doesn't seem to have much downside and you never know, someone might hear.
