  **Request:**

  Any good *Dark Souls*/*Bloodborne* fanfiction? Preferentially with the following qualities, ordered by importance:

  1. Rational/rationality-adjacent.

  2. Length: 20k words or more.

  3. Good worldbuilding.

  ___

  **Book recommendations:**

  * I recently read [*The Traitor Baru Cormorant*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23444482-the-traitor-baru-cormorant) by Seth Dickinson, and found it to be a *marvelous* rational story. Goodreads' summary is pretty good:

   >Tomorrow, on the beach, Baru Cormorant will look up from the sand of her home and see red sails on the horizon.

   >The Empire of Masks is coming, armed with coin and ink, doctrine and compass, soap and lies. They'll conquer Baru’s island, rewrite her culture, criminalize her customs, and dispose of one of her fathers. But Baru is patient. She'll swallow her hate, prove her talent, and join the Masquerade. She will learn the secrets of empire. She’ll be exactly what they need. And she'll claw her way high enough up the rungs of power to set her people free.

   >In a final test of her loyalty, the Masquerade will send Baru to bring order to distant Aurdwynn, a snakepit of rebels, informants, and seditious dukes. Aurdwynn kills everyone who tries to rule it. To survive, Baru will need to untangle this land’s intricate web of treachery - and conceal her attraction to the dangerously fascinating Duchess Tain Hu.

   >But Baru is a savant in games of power, as ruthless in her tactics as she is fixated on her goals. In the calculus of her schemes, all ledgers must be balanced, and the price of liberation paid in full.

   Its worldbuilding is excellent — calling it "low-fantasy" would be an understatement: it has a "fantasy" feel, but everything is fully reducible to physics. It has a truly fascinating number of [Level 2 Intelligent](http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/level2intelligent) characters. Its themes, of power and well-intentioned extremism, would be very appealing to this subreddit.

   I'm somewhat surprised it's not more popular here.

   (Also, [the first sequel](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35485447-the-monster-baru-cormorant) is scheduled to be released this October.)

  * [*14*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15062217-14) by Peter Clines is not as good as the aforementioned book, but is still pretty interesting. Premise: A man moves into a new apartment building, and gradually discovers a lot of seemingly-supernatural or just weird anomalies. Lightbulbs in his kitchen shine black light, five-legged green cockroaches are running around the building, door to one of the other apartments lacks a doorknob, and so on.

   Naturally, he attempts to figure out what's going on.

   Characters generally act reasonable, and there's quite a few tropes r/rational would enjoy. It's not without flaws, though, [light spoiler](#s " especially the latter half").

  * [*The Fifth Defiance*](https://thefifthdefiance.com/about/) by u/WalterTFD is a rational story set in post-apocalyptic ruins of a "superheroes" setting. It has an interesting flavour, and a lot of high-power-levels conflicts. It's pretty grim, though.

  **Film recommendations:**

  * [*Annihilation*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annihilation_(film\)) follows a group of researchers set to investigate a strange, slowly-expanding anomaly, possibly of extraterrestrial origin. It's generally rational, and doesn't try to dumb anything down. It also [conceptual spoiler](#s " features a properly alien alien"), which is nearly unheard-of in movies.

  * [*10 Cloverfield Lane*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10_Cloverfield_Lane). Premise: the protagonist wakes up in a bunker after suffering a car incident, with two men — the bunker's owner, and his acquaintance. The owner tells her that he saved her life, that there has been "an attack", and that the air outside is "contaminated", so they all must stay there. She must figure out what to do and who to trust.

   The protagonist is pretty sensible, and the movie is pretty good at playing with an inquisitive viewer's expectations.

    I very much second Annhihilation.

    As an aside, I was actually kind of surprised to see the movie and realize the main cast was only comprised* of women. It was obvious in the trailer, but I guess it didn't register because they didn't make a big deal out of it. I thought that was pretty impressive; the characters weren't just *incidentally* women, in that their gender did matter and affected the plot, but at the same time, they weren't *exclusively* women, in that their gender was advertised as a primary trait. Basically, Annihilation was what the new ghostbusters should have been.

    Also, the soundtrack was fucking dope.

        Huh, I legit didn't know that using "compromised" in that way was invalid. Thanks for the tip.
        ```

        - u/None:
          ```
          Compromised can’t be used in that way because it’s the wrong word entirely. Comprised, on the other hand, is perfectly legitimate there.
          ```

    Baru Cormorant was indeed amazing. Probably the best book of 2015

  I'm going to reccomend the manga (and anime, although I haven't watched it) [Kingdom](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://myanimelist.net/manga/16765/Kingdom&ved=2ahUKEwiHv7KbyIjcAhUB4YMKHURQBT0QFjAlegQIBhAB&usg=AOvVaw2N7-2k5R5jQg-Un9TZG2lg), which is in theory, a manga about the historical Qin dynasty's unication of china,and in practice a maximally hot blooded shonen violence fest with awesome, larger than life characters, devious plotters, and impressive art.

  The main character is explicitly a-rational, but a number of the side characters and antagonists have INT as their primary stat.

    After a few volumes kingdom is basically dragon ball, with battle auras and characters capable of destroying entire armies. It's absolute shit.

  [Destiny's Crucible](https://www.goodreads.com/series/215776-destiny-s-crucible)

  *Oh my god*

  Easily the best thing I've read this year.

  About a chemist that winds up in a nasty invasion on an island in a pre-industrial world. World is consistent and interesting. Realistic populations, inventions, administration, and people. Author has a really nice writing style on top of that. I even bought the 4th book since I was so invested.
  ```

- u/DangerouslyUnstable:
  ```
  Just because I haven't seen it posted here in a while, I'm going to recommend [With this Ring](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-story-only.25076/).  

  It's a self insert fan fiction of the Young Justice animated tv show where the main character is given an Orange Power Ring (in case you are unfamiliar, Orange rings are fueled by avarice, and have a tendency to drive their users insane over time. Dealing with this and trying to still be a productive super hero is a major theme of the early chapters). 


  It updates every day (literally every day, he hasn't missed a single day in years, it's ~2 million words by my rough estimate). The protagonist is pretty rational but the world he is in (DC comics) is decidedly non-rational. I think the writing is pretty good (although there are definitely some quirks that the author does that take some getting used to), the characterization and growth of even side characters is generally engaging and interesting and there is also some pretty good munchinkry of power ring abilities.  

  The worst thing about it is that in my time zone (Pacific Time) new updates usually post between 10 and 11 pm and so I end up staying up too late waiting for the new chapter.
  ```

  - u/Onwards_and_Downward:
    ```
    Ok, so I've read this story and I like it.

    Something I've never understood - The red chapter titles. So its like a timeline split? And most (all?) of the Red chapters are part of the "renegade" timeline (color/symbols from Mass Effect series)? However not all of the chapters seem to be part of the timeline? Or just some stuff gets ignored/retconnned without reference?

    I've only read the story on the Story Only thread and... it is just weird. It detracts from my read, I want two "story only" threads if my interpretation of the Red/Not Red chapters is correct. 

    Anyway, I'm confused. Is it just me? Can anyone explain?
    ```

    - u/sicutumbo:
      ```
      I understand the confusion, since it really isn't explained in the story only, and only kind of explained in the main thread FAQ.

      The divergence is actually before the story starts. The Renegade had a bad day at the office the day before he was transported to the DC universe, and was determined not to take shit from anyone. This was exacerbated by the orange ring, and later venombuster injection, meaning the Renegade will usually take the aggressive, less diplomatic options and the Paragon will take more diplomatic and generally longer term options. The author notes however that neither is strictly auperior to the other, unlike in the Mass Effect games that the system takes its name from. When the viewpoint character would normally take one option and suddenly changes their mind, that decision change is indicated by the paragon/renegade symbol. All actions taken in either timeline are internally consistent, but have no bearing on the other, so there's no retconning. Not intentionally anyways, the author may forget something occasionally. One bit you may have gotten confused on is that there were a few updates from the Red Lantern's perspective that also had the date colored red, but that was fairly distinctive. Maybe you're talking about when the episode title is in a different color than the date and time? The episode title's color indicates who will be the focus of the episode, the date and time color says who will be the focus of that single post.

      The timelines can't be separated into different threads because you often need context from the other timeline in order to understand the current one. Otherwise details would have been written twice.

      For the early part of the story, you can generally assume that the Renegade parts went about as the Paragon ones did except where otherwise noted.

      If you have any other questions, I should be able to answer.
      ```

    - u/redrach:
      ```
      Sure, it's pretty simple.

      The story has two separate parallel timelines. The first and original one is the "Paragon" timeline, and the second is the "Renegade" timeline. Initially the only difference between them is that the protagonist had a bad day at work before the events of the latter, and as a consequence was uncharacteristically impulsive and rude to the people he came across. That quickly snowballs like crazy leading to them being very different characters at this point of time, and the contrast between the two is entertaining.

      The story is divided into episodes, and each episode is mostly from the viewpoint of either the Paragon character (indicated by white-colored date) or the Renegade (red-colored date). Episodes are further divided into chapters, with one chapter being released every day. Occasional a chapter will show what's going on at the same time in the other timeline. The color of the timestamp (again white/red) is used to indicate which of the two timelines is the focus of the current chapter.

      So for example there could be an episode dealing with the Paragon investigating a series of crimes and how he solves them, with a single Renegade chapter at the end showing the aftermath of how he solved the problem.

      I recommend reading both time lines. A lot of people get turned off of the Renegade segments because of how much of a jerk he acts like, but he gets a ton of character development and has some of the best parts of the story.

  **Request**  


  I'm looking for stories which are **grimdark** and/or have very **gray morality** and/or have **villains** as the **protagonist**, while also having **smart/driven main characters**.

  A few varied (but limited) examples:

  [Worm](https://parahumans.wordpress.com/)

  [Ruthless](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10493620/1/) (one of the best HP fanfics I've read - smart and depressing)

  [Practical Guide to Evil](https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/)

  [Metropolitan Man](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10360716/1/The-Metropolitan-Man)

  [The Dark Wizard of Donkerk](http://alexanderwales.com/darkWizardNaNo2015.html)

  [Superman: Red Son](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/154798.Superman)

  [How To Succeed in Evil](https://www.goodreads.com/series/83726-how-to-succeed-in-evil)

  [Neil Gaiman's Snow, Glass, Apples](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12917233-snow-glass-apples)

  [The Dire Saga](https://www.goodreads.com/series/179186-the-dire-saga) (Though I stopped reading after book 3)

  [The End of the F***ing World ](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6257970/)

  I've also tried a few asian translated novels like [Warlock of the Magus World](https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world) but (possibly mainly because of the translation) to me they read like written by stereotypical overly excited 13 year old gamers though some of the concepts seem great at first. So maybe there's something that can sate my thirst there, although I am starting to doubt it.
  ```

  - u/Amonwilde:
    ```
    I would recommend Joe Abercrombie. [Best Served Cold](https://www.joeabercrombie.com/books/best-served-cold/) isa good place to start, but you could also start with the first book in the First Law series.

    I feel like you must have tried [A Practical Guide to Evil](https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/), though it's not as grimdark as some of your others.

    Another one to try is [Prince of Thorns](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0052RERW8/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1).
    ```

    - u/sparkc:
      ```
      Seconding the recommendation for Joe Abercrombie’s novels (and to a lesser extent the Mark Lawrence novel). Best Served Cold is, from the outset, the novel that most ticks the boxes but I would recommend starting with the first novel in that world, The Blade Itself, which is from a trilogy that develops in a very interesting way.
      ```

  - u/Escapement:
    ```
    The Engineer Trilogy by K J Parker.
    ```

  - u/appropriate-username:
    ```
    I think the most grimdark online rational serial I've read is a sailor moon story, sailor nothing.

    Death Note was a fairly rational anime and is also pretty grim.

    Grim videogames that I thought were good but may or may not be rational are Bioshock and Lisa.

    I also want to add an anti-recommendation for Madoka. It's fairly dramatic and grim but most of the drama there happens because the protagonists are idiots.
    ```

- u/tjhance:
  ```
  The webcomic [The Adventures of Dr. McNinja](http://drmcninja.com/) is certainly not rational fic but I think it has some elements that readers here will enjoy.

  *Dr. McNinja* is about a man raised as a ninja, who dreamed of being like Batman, and now serves as a Vigilante crimefighter in the city of Cumberland while also running a medical practice that treats exotic ailments. All to the disappointment of his ninja family.

  It's a very silly comic and ridiculous things happen all the time.
  It has some trappings familiar to us rational-fic readers: [spoiler](#s "The cloning tech, which McNinja used to become as broadly-skilled as he is, and which brought Ben Franklin back to life, is vastly underutilized by the world at large. Also, at one point, McNinja intends to help invent immortality, but this thread is dropped.")

  However, it's genuinely funny and it has a pretty well-constructed plot overall. Furthermore,

  * The antagonist King Radical is definitely the hero of his own story. [spoiler](#s "He wants to save his dying homeland by summoning its citizens into Dr. McNinja's universe. To this end, he needs to make the universe more radical, by improving the local economy, building orphanages, introducing better pizza recipes, etc. He plans a summoning ritual which will replace the 'worst dudes' of society with the radical citizens from his homeland. He hopes that 'naturally radical' citizens like McNinja will join him.") He is also an intelligent villain, and he [spoiler](#s "actively tracks down time-travelers from the future, believing he'll eventually find one who was sent to stop him.")
  * The immortal Dracula [spoiler](#s "is considering ending his life. But first, he needs to know what the afterlife is like, so as a test, he hatches a plan to kill Ben Franklin II and bring him back to life, in order to find out what it was like")
  * Franz Rayner is genre-savvy, even when the genre is absurd. [spoiler](#s "To defeat McNinja, He makes 1000s of clones of McNinja and then fights them, using the principle that one lone man can take down hordes of faceless opponents.")

    Read the series as it was being released, enjoyed it, own all the print compilations. :)  Hilarious and entertaining, but not rational unless you assume that in-universe things consistently work via Rule-Of-Cool laws.

    [The Dao of Magic](https://www.royalroadl.com/fiction/11397/the-dao-of-magic) might qualify depending on what features you like.
    ```

  - u/Mellow_Fellow_:
    ```
    Closest I can think of is [The Legend of Randidly Ghosthound](https://www.royalroadl.com/fiction/11209/the-legend-of-randidly-ghosthound/chapter/127131/chapter-1), though it's not really the same.
    ```

    - u/Izeinwinter:
      ```
      I decided that I bloody well hated that on the grounds that it is just straight up carnography, the social setups make zero percent sense (.. Where are the cities with gun-focused classes? The societies that deal with monsters via organized armies? One of their initial neighbours had an infinite ammo source.. but nope instead we have societies with such toxic focus on violence that they have major to-the-death tournaments while under constant external attack..), and also there is no logic to the world building. ¨

      The casualty rates are much to high to work in the absence of resurrection magics (Everywhere. Not just on earth. Every society we see loose so many more people to combat than they can possibly get from reproduction that it is not funny) and the xp/ power curves are whatever makes the best masturbatory power fantasy. 

      Re; the last bit, the main character should start falling approximately infinitely behind when everyone else starts using dungeons, but this never happens. His initial edge in power was from spending time in a fast-time dungeon. He never enters another one, while everyone else makes use of them... but somehow he does not get left behind. ARRGH.

      - u/Amonwilde:
        ```
        Not to defend what is mostly a ridiculous story too much, but he spends years in the prison on Shal's world. At almost all parts in the story, he has consistently been in the system for longer subjective time than the other people from the town.

        Almost every war has shown that you can have a ridiculously high casualty rate and not affect population considerably over time, as long as most of the people that die are men and not women.
        ```

    - u/Amonwilde:
      ```
      I would say The Legend of Randidly Ghosthound is better. You might also try [The Snake Report](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSnakeReport/), though I'm not a fan.
      ```

    - u/ilI1il1Ili1i1liliiil:
      ```
      I gave it a try. It's nonsense from a rational viewpoint, but modestly entertaining. So.. a tentative thanks for the recommendation.
