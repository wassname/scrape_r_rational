  Ok so this chapter looks like a lore build episode.
  One small note, the scene could benefit from a bit more explaining of who is who.

  I'm trying to figure out what the technobabble at the start's consequences are and how it relates to what happened afterwards.

   [spoilers](#s " It sounds like it's saying that the entire universe is simulated. This simulation uses the A-A storage system and was badly written such that it had privileged/system space open, which an attacker can use to insert their own ideas. Oroku was able to somehow interface directly with the simulation, and thus performed an A-A attack as she was dying, creating the dragons.")

  I think that covers the major implications if I'm interpreting it correctly. Anyone come to different conclusions?

    I came to the same conclusion. My guess is that the culprit in the end will be the Iris. Zenyatta says "all are one within the Iris", which you might interpret as either a nondenominational afterlife oooor something along the lines of a matrix style simulation. (Are we supposed to spoiler our WMG?)
