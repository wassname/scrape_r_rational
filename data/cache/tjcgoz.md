## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  Yesterday I [reviewed Cockatiel x Chameleon](https://recordcrash.substack.com/p/book-review-cockatiel-x-chameleon), the literary fiction web novel about porn artists, which I submitted as its own post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/tcozkx/c18rt_cockatiel_x_chameleon_new_work_by_author_of/). I got the feeling a few people here missed it, so I'm recommending it yet again just in case. It's 150k words dropped all at once.

      Does the story have stakes? WtC felt a bit too easy, given how powerful Juniper was.
      ```

      - u/grekhaus:
        ```
        Stakes are present and largely interpersonal - the big threats are party cohesion, rival adventuring parties, people trying to scam the group out of their dungeon loot, injury scares making people shy about going back into the dungeons, will X be forced to abandon Y moral standard that they've held to for years, etc. There's more of a sense that the characters can fail without it being the end of the story.

    Kingdom building as a genre is very interesting to me, and I’m not sure I’ve nailed down the genre. It has some major tropes/problems that I struggle with, but I still do enjoy it. In batches is best, for me. 


    Scale is a huge issue for me. It’s like: Man starts out farming with “new” techniques, impresses people, plot, plot, builds better farming tools, plot, plot, he’s anointed king (a farmers tale). Or it’s the other end of the spectrum where I just cannot be arsed to read about farming for this many words with no plot.



    The other big issue is suspension of disbelief. I’m sure there’s a TvTropes article for what I’m about to describe: the main character is a lifelong hunter/gatherer/farmer/Pre-industrial blacksmith/PHD/Everyman. This is related to the prevalence of isekai in kingdom building I’m sure. 


    In much the way that Brocton’s Celestial Forge at times feels like a well-documented-wiki-dive, kingdom building stories always seem to start out as a farmer who always know whatever they need to know from Wikipedia. There’s just exposition disguised as plot because they just know that this plant needs compost from this animals’ manure. And then to plant this next crop in the rotation. 



    Thank you for the rec’s, hope more people can chime in with stories as well. 🤝

      Yeah, I try to avoid stories that lean too heavily on those tropes. But they do appear, in some form or another. The ASOIAF one are pretty bad in this regard, though I still enjoy them.

      ```
      I’m not much of a kingdom builder guy nor know anywhere near enough about any of the particulars to know when the author is pulling stuff out of their ass, but my favorite(in my very very limited experience) one is [Mediterranean Hegemon of Ancient Greece](https://www.novelupdates.com/series/mediterranean-hegemon-of-ancient-greece/).

      Fair warning, the translation quality is kinda bad. The author definitely knows their stuff when it comes to Ancient Greece. It’s certainly more focused on the wars and military strategy than the kingdom building, which I think is done real well, or at least looks real cool. At the very least, it’s an interesting one.

    > A Young Woman's Political Record (Youjo Senki/Saga of Tanya the Evil) by jacobk. Incomplete.

    It's marked "Incomplete", but the last chapter says:

    I can very much second Demesne, it's an incredibly charming story. It has interesting worldbuilding and wonderful characters and interaction.  

    Dunno what exactly it is, but it feels relatively "fresh". It doesn't noticably crib ideas from other stories in the genre, and while it is sometimes tropey, they're usually played straight in a good way.

    ```
    [Valkyrie's Shadow](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/39336/valkyries-shadow) is amazing and highly recommended. It's a paraquel to Overlord that covers the consequences of the Sorcerous Kingdom on the natives of the New World, mainly its new subjects with various other perspectives sprinkled in just like the original LN. Some familiarity with the source is needed to enjoy it to its fullest though. The choice of main characters is very apt for the storytelling and kingdom building, and the originality of filling in the source's blank spaces is executed with a literary quality you'd be hard pressed to find in even published works. Best part is the story updates every day and has been since January of last year. Nearly 1.5 million words so far and unlike most million word stories, very little is dross.
    ```

    ```
    Release That Witch! is pretty good.... but the translation from CN is *terrible*. 

    People accuse many stories of being barely cleaned up machine translations, but RTW was definitely MT'd. 

    That said, I don't know if it's because reading it just broke something in my brain after a while, or if the person doing at least got better at cleaning it up or if the story was actually that gripping, but after a few dozen chapters I mostly stopped being annoyed by it.

    I recommend it if you have experience with powering through subpar translations to enjoy the story underneath it.

    ```
    The [Daniel Black](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B074CGJYSS) series might be something you're interested in.
    ```

    - u/chiruochiba:
      ```
      Fair warning, the kingdom building in that series often takes a backseat to focus on the male protagonist's harem and overtones of The Red Pill.
      ```

      - u/k5josh:
        ```
        That's fair, and I too am more interested in the kingdom building parts than the girls, but I will say in fairness that they are way, _way_, on the "survive" side of the thrive-survive spectrum.

  Hi! My first time posting in one of these threads. I've been reading a lot of magic school lately. If anyone has recs for more, I'll easily take them:  
  
  [Reignite](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/41158/reignite-a-fantasy-saga)  
  Decent. I disagree with the direction the story is taking, though; it's way too contrived. Also... it straight up doesn't make sense at parts. People can change and grow, but the choices the main character makes at times feel antithetical to her goals/personality. The bond between the main character and her familiar is enjoyable enough, and the saving grace.   
  
  [Combat Archaeologist: Rowan](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/38362/combat-archaeologist-rowan)  
  It's really generic. Harry Potter x  Dungeon Delving RPG. Orphan protagonist that secretly has an incredible hidden apitude for magic. There's even the houses! He's not overpowered yet, so points in his favor (also the archaeologist part is neat?), I guess. It's also kind of dead. Good if you're really bored, as it's comptently written enough (I think. It's been a while, not gonna lie.)   
  
  [Mark of the Fool](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/41618/mark-of-the-fool)  
  There's poor pacing, but there's a lot of words written, and it updates fast. It's (mostly) fun to read, too. I'll just get this out of the way first: the main character is overpowered as fuck. His "mark", which is supposed to be a limiter, isn't. At all. He also gets everything handed to him, has super-overpowered friends, and why the fuck is there only 20-ish students in a class that the super-powerful chancellor is teaching, in a subject that seems legitimately useful as well?   
  There's a lot of interesting choices in the story. I love the way the main character fucks off to the next continent and their continent-ending threat is considered whatever for the super-magical city. His secret isn't insignificant, but straight up is in the grand scheme of things. I'd recommend skipping the tournament/demon summoner arc, though. It drags. A lot. And it's too damn long.  
  
  [My Best Friend is An Eldritch Horror](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/44229/my-best-friend-is-an-eldritch-horror)  
  It's lively! I just caught up a day ago. Frequent updates. The eldritch horror vibe is done okay, but mostly for comedy, and I do find it pretty funny. Honestly, I don't exactly remember what happened during the fights because I binged it so fast, but I remember them sounding pretty cool. Very flashy. Sometimes you just want big things to explode.   
  
  [Arcanum](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/49733/arcanum) \[RT, i think?\]  
  Only seven chapters, and might be dead. What's there is pretty damn good though. Reminds me of the applied mathematics xkcd comic. Short enough to try it out. If you don't like it, whatever, and if you do, you can be sad like me.   
  
  [The Flower that Bloomed Nowhere](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/28806/the-flower-that-bloomed-nowhere) \[RT\]  
  I'm not sure if this actually is magic school, but it's tagged as it on RR and has elements so close enough. It's been recommened on here a bunch, so: I love the characterization of literally everyone, I think the prose is excellent, I enjoy the psychological/philosophical/political aspects, the setting is probably one of my favourites ever. I legitimately do not care about the murder mystery that much? It's definitely interesting, but I would also read 500k words of Su & friends using magic to shit in class and vanish the excrement so... It's definitely no comedy, but it's surprisingly funny (tbf my sense of humor is awful). There's always the caveat in recommendations that it's slow, but... I don't really care. Maybe you would care.   
  
  [A Practical Guide to Sorcery](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/34009/a-practical-guide-to-sorcery?sorting=newest) \[RST\]  
  The worldbuilding is consistent and logical, and it hits all my favourite tropes just right. I adore hidden identities/genderbenders (if anyone has recs for genderbenders/stories that play with gender please share, ftm preferred but mtf good as long as it isnt pervy which happens way too often.). It's also a lot of fun watching characters come to incorrect but not absurd conclusions with the information they're given. There's all of that, but this is my favourite webnovel rn because of the protagonist: she's arrogant, judgmental, and kind of a fucking asshole at times but she's never purposefully cruel (unlike many other protagonists, even the ones on the more moral side). Underneath all that fragile pride and trauma is someone just so desperate and painfully earnest about her desire to learn magic that I find it hard to do anything but root for her. Also, it's nice to have a character that is both paranoid for rightful reasons and is negatively affected by it. 

  I've also read: MOL (good), Poppy War (neat!), Scholomance (good), Vita Nostra (very neat!), Arcane Ascension (ok), TNOTW (ok, a bit too much), Forge of Destiny (too much slice of life, but good).

  Heard of: Black Magicians, Magicians (I read a bit and the protagonist is a bit too much), Mage Errant, Nevernight, and some others that are commonly recommended on r/fantasy

    > (if anyone has recs for genderbenders/stories that play with gender please share, ftm preferred but mtf good as long as it isnt pervy which happens way too often.)

    I loved [The Pureblood Pretense](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7613196/1/The-Pureblood-Pretense) and its sequels. It's a Harry Potter fanfic with a premise quite similar to PGTS, and very entertainingly written. There's also a lot of it: the author is currently on book five, and the first four books total about 1.4 million words.
    ```

    - u/sephirothrr:
      ```
      I wanna chime in with a caveat to the pureblood pretense series - while it is undoubtedly excellent, I think it tries a little too hard to parallel the crossover source material (in this case Tamora Pierce's song of the lioness novels), to the point where I feel like future plot beats are indirectly spoiled, but I'm still holding out hope that I'll be wrong
      ```

  - u/Darkpiplumon:
    ```
    If you can look past the quest format, no threadmarked chapters in the first year, and are looking for a darker magic school story, you may like Polyhistor Academy on questionable questing.

    Basically, 100 people enter every year, and the top 10 come out alive, with unlimited money, great magical power and or knowledge, and a decent amount of trauma. The main character decides to enroll in order to understand his parents better, both graduates, and find himself in the way.

    Pros: 
    -Interesting and huge worldbuilding.
    -Lots of text and strategies by the author and commenters.
    -Battle royal magical school, how cool is that?
    -Quest

    Cons:
    -Relatively slow and infrequent updates.
    -No threadmarks on the first year (out of two).
    -Kinda dark/edgy, may not be your style.
    -Quest.

    [The Cursed Heart](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/39959/the-cursed-heart) 
    I don't remember too much about this one. I remember I enjoyed reading it about a year ago and that it was interesting seeing a trans main character because I had never seen that done before.

    We seem to have pretty similar tastes, so if you sling me a few of your tops I'd be grateful :) so magic schools

    * I'd recommend bumping Mage Errant from heard of to read. 
    * Witch Week by Diana Wynne Jones is a very unique take on the concept, predating most of the tropes. It's set in an orphanage for children of witches burned at the stake in a 90s England where witchcraft is illegal on penalty of death and hereditary.
    * I notice that Mother of Learning isn't on your list?
    * Christopher Nuttall writes a lot, they're quite tropey IMO.
    * Impractical Magic (https://magesofistima.home.blog/) I've been meaning to read this for a while but haven't yet.

    > Decent. I disagree with the direction the story is taking, though; it's way too contrived. Also... it straight up doesn't make sense at parts. People can change and grow, but the choices the main character makes at times feel antithetical to her goals/personality. The bond between the main character and her familiar is enjoyable enough, and the saving grace. 

    This is my feeling too. Or rather it felt like the MC did make reasonable choices given her goals and personality, but every time she got pushed around by circumstances or stronger willed characters until she's back where she started. Only at the end she's happy. I'm not sure it's irrational or unrealistic for a young girl to be pushed around like that, but the story didn't sell the stronger willed characters as able to convince her and even if they did it felt quite unsatisfying as a story for her to start and end in the same place as a happy ending. 

    > There's a lot of interesting choices in the story. I love the way the main character fucks off to the next continent and their continent-ending threat is considered whatever for the super-magical city. 

    Agreed. Mark of the Fool has a lot of flaws, you mention some, but this aspect was perfection. I wish more stories had the reluctant chosen one actually not follow their destiny. 

    I wish this story actually committed to the concept of him being The Fool, someone who can't fight, can't do magic, but can surround themselves with a bunch of allies - have him actually seek out and start a cabal from the most promising students with his Fool powers - and can be a force multiplier by drawing perfect runic circles or being a living wikipedia.

  I stumbled apon [A Sith? During the fall](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/51925/a-sith-during-the-fall) and also last weeks rec of Accidentally a Shrine Maiden, both of which I think turned out to be exactly my favourite sort of formula:
  Isekai where the MC immediately just starts helping those around them. 
  No angst, no heavy action or level up/system learning intro, none of that drama, just immediately cuts to the interpersonal interaction with the world which is largely positive and stays there.

  So, asking for more obscure (because I've already read all the things regularly reced here or elsewhere) recs which fit this formula.

  A few more stories off the top of my head that fit:

  Orochimama

  Overkill, So I became a Dungeon now what?, the highschool DXD and kungfoo panda X Taylor crosses.

  Arkendrithest (though after a few chapters)
  The Hiki X MHA and desumachi crosses

  A young womans political record and a few other Tanya ffs

  Flarina's pokemon and Bayonetta SI's

  Tavern Cat

  A jackal amoung snakes

  And tones more im forgetting. 

  So any recs I might not have read with this story structure?
  Thanks.

    I have to say I'm a tad confused by your characterization of Accidentally a Shrine Priestess as an isekai where MC starts helping people around them. Sophie has so far >!mooched off the villagers, kept the shrine spirit company, and gave one person a class!< as part of her priestly duties, seems odd to characterize it as being particularly helpful. Ditto for Sith. By those standards Overlord would also be a where the MC goes around helping people with minimal angst, so I'm not entirely sure what it is you're actually looking for.

    Edit: Also, de-rec on A Sith. It's basically a standard self-insert wish fulfillment formula and not a particularly well-written one, where the world revolves around the MC. Characters lack distinct voices and personalities and feel cliched and wooden.
    ```

    - u/Dragfie:
      ```
      Yeah overlord sort of fits too. The magnitude of the "help" isn't particularly relevant, just that it doesnt have like 10-30 chapters of nothing but survival, litrpg progression or angst but immediate interaction with the natives instead.

      Shrine and sith both are new, and are shaping up to be positive, but the point is they both immediately start with social interactions with the natives and stay there.
      ```

    Also not an Isekai, but [Legends & Lattes](https://www.amazon.com/Legends-Lattes-Novel-Fantasy-Stakes-ebook/dp/B09R9FSZB5) really scratches a similar itch.

        It's a story about building a coffee shop in a swords and sorcery setting; there's almost no fighting (the story opens _in media res_ at the end of a fight but that's it), it's all about the process of building a small business.
        ```

      - u/megazver:

    Constellations on spacebattles is probably one of the better stories on help people that I can think of.

    Its a Worm/Okami crossover which has the main character revitalize the asian community and a lot of focus is given on helping others. Not much knowledge about the source material is required.

    EDIT: Not an isekai though.

        Its set in the worm universe. Honestly I do understand being sick of that universe though I do recommend giving it a couple chapters to try.


        Its very similar to accidentally a shrine maiden in that she actually becomes a shrine maiden and there is a lot of focus on her helping her community. Combat is not a focus and its mostly slice of life with her helping others.

  The MC gets isekai'd into a LitRPG world, but gets stuck as a farmer and is desperate to get into any other class; however, he can only choose a new class upon reaching level 100, which is uncommon to do in a lifetime.


  The story does a great job building a world where incarnates from other worlds are common and exploitationists are a known class (So much of the low hanging fruit has been picked) while still giving room (and reasonable explanation) for the Main Character to find new exploits. 

  The worldbuilding balances between "Exactly as horrid as a physics-enforced monarchy and grindfest would be" and "Hey cool, a world that's a game", with a lot of cool little details. Killing a member of your own species makes you go feral, so while Humans have little warfare, inter-species cooperation is much harder. Humans get magic from farming as a base, while Orcs get it from fighting, and also spend the the earliest parts of their life as non-sentient and bloodlusted and have to level before they're consciousness enough to stop fighting and join proper Orc society; There's thus a clear conflict of interest in geopolitical relations.
