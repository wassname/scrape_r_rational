## [RT] Welcome to Floating Point

### Post:

Hey folks, author here. If anybody was checking out Floating Point six months ago when the first chapter was submitted to /r/rational, I thought you might like to know the first of three planned novels is now finished, finalized, and ready to read on the website.

The print/ebook version with bonus material is coming in June, and I've started posting WIPs of chapters from the second book, Revelation of Floating Point. So, good time to get on board.

Thanks!

Blurb: *The digital universe of Netwerk. Thousands of servers, millions of living Programs (the evolutionary descendents of Apps) living in relative disharmony as one massive social network. It’s home to individuals seeking love, happiness, madness, trolling, order, stability, lawlessness, anonymity, individually, community, and everything in between. Binary people making binary decisions… but life is what happens between Zero and One. Life happens within the floating point decimals…*

  Any chance we could get a blurb in the main body to know if we'd be interested in clicking through?  It's obviously easy for one person to click, but you might get more interest with a quick summary or teaser to entice people in.  Kudos on completing a novel!
