## Updating HPMOR to be more scientific

>Yeah. I just read those reviews, and I have to admit, even drunk, it has a LOT of very valid points. It really makes much of HPMOR really disappointing in retrospect. Not only wrong science, but a lack of science at crucial points in the story.
I'm not certain of it, but maybe the problem could be what the reviewer mentioned, that HPMOR only has one author with no formal education and a busy schedule. It is still quite a surprisingly good story in spite of that. I don't think the premise of RationalScientist!Harry had been explored much prior to HPMOR, and it is a premise that really deserves further exploration. Since EY is probably going to be too busy for it, I think I'm going to at some point start the collaborative project of making an updated version of HPMOR with more science and better science, and a more curious protagonist. It will probably require multiple writers and beta-readers from multiple scientific disciplines. And since the protagonist will be more curious, the story will involve a lot more exploration of the magical world, and therefore more side-plots and "filler" chapters. Some of the original writing from HPMOR will probably stay the same, but I doubt all of it will. This might end up being another alternate universe that spans all seven years at Hogwarts and maybe a little beyond that too.
I am going to make another post to see who's interested in helping me with this.

I might not participate in such a project myself until I have a little more college-level science education under my belt, but I think it would be a good idea to start planning for it and finding people who are willing to work on the project.

Who's interested in this?

  More exploration of the magical world requires that there's a good explanation of what's going to be observed in the first place. "Just add more science to it" doesn't work for a fictional setting, you actually have to come up with the answers as well. 

  With "multiple writers and beta-readers from multiple scientific disciplines" you'll just get a bunch of bored undergrads with too much time on their hands arguing for their pet theories. I expect the result to be an incoherent mess.

    This would at least rule out the scientific mistakes made by people who didn't even take relevant subjects at the undergrad level.  Or, God help you, you could ask your bored undergrads to do a literature review in preparation for becoming bored grad-students.

  [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2z3sz0/hpmor_full_review_su3su2u1/) is the most relevant, thorough critique I can find of MoR, and it certainly touches on this. (There are lots of other awesome /r/rational authors - looking at you, /u/alexanderwales /u/DayStarEld /u/writingathing - who have offered their own criticism, too.)

  In any case, I'd certainly be on board for this. Though I think the best way would be going forward with a genius.com-style annotation of MoR, as was proposed in some /r/hpmor thread^I^can^no^longer^(find). If that was done, we'd be able to highlight and point out all the deficits and lacking areas, then propose, discuss, and implement fixes.

  Ofc, I love MoR and /u/EliezerYudkowsky, but it's a first draft, and it shows.

  I have been working on writing the mechanics behind time travel set in a universe which only allows Stable Time Loops drawing on my computer science knowledge. So far, my story is written as a series of experiments to illustrate the important points and the best exploits with no plot involved.

  It's not very far along, but if there ever is a scientific!HPMOR, I'll have something to contribute. With a little modification, I could rewrite the protagonist to be Harry instead.

  General proposal: in a "rational" story, there should be an obvious Science Ball.  It should be clear who is holding the Science Ball.  When a character is holding the Science Ball, they are required to be quoting accurate, or at least at-the-time accurate, real-world knowledge from whatever discipline they are talking about, or the author is subject to critique.  Likewise, when the character is *not* holding the Science Ball, they can fuck up every bit as badly as any other layperson.

  That one is forgetting that Harry has just read a couple of books. He has no formal scientific education whatsoever. It's not surprising he doesn't know that much.

    HPMOR still aspires to be rational though, and Harry is very much an over the top rational aspiring character. Giving an excuse like that seems a lot like trying to have it go both ways, letting Harry be in many ways smarter than anyone around him, while at the same time excusing any shortcomings on his part by saying that he's still just a kid.

    If HPMOR is trying to be rational story, then there are still many ways to think of how it could be improved. That goal, in and of itself, is not undesirable or not worth aspiring towards.

      yes?

        My point is, if the story is going to glorify Harry's good sense whenever he does something particularly intelligent, then ideally it would do as much as it can to take apart his flaws rather than simply excusing them. Which isn't to say HPMOR makes Harry seem perfect, just that Harry still has a long way to go, and exploring the areas in which he still comes up short has merit.

          I mean, did you read the last arc? Pretty much every chapter is "QV did something evil, hahahaha. And Harry Potter felt very bad because he was stupid." Even the last chapter is "Oh wow I am still very stupid."

          The idea of "Harry still has a long way to go, and exploring the areas in which he still comes up short has merit" is ever present throughout the book. "Tsuyoku Naritai!" might as well be on of Harry's slogans.
