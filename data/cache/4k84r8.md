  Let's see... Little compulsion to ethical behaviour, resents people for reasons she won't communicate to them, a tendency to self-aggrandize, socially isolated, and she has a crippling dept to (someone described as) a power-hungry aristocrat. Yeah, somehow I don't see her arc having a happy ending for anyone involved.

  In case nobody writes a similar comment: I actually like Melanie a lot so far as a character, and, embarrassingly, gained a bit of perspective on a friendship of mine (with me as the Sander and my friend as the Melanie).  Further, you managed to convey a bunch of information about Sander, and his strengths and weaknesses, without having Sander take the reader's attention off Melanie, or making him the focus of her PoV.  Having him give a monologue full of new information, and then showing how that monologue is actually sort of inappropriate and indicative of the problems with their friendship, strikes me as a really clever way to deliver exposition and characterization for two characters all at once in an elegant and subtle way.

    I don't think Melanie's a compelling character, in the sense that I don't really want to know what will happen to her, but she is well-written.

    And yeah, I can totally see myself as the Sander in any number of relationships. That's basically why I only make friends with people who are good at communicating their intentions and feelings.

  This chapter sees the introduction of our third viewpoint character (and last-for-now), Melanie Masters, young proprietor of the Black Mare and unlikely hero. The next chapter will be posted two weeks from now.

    So we have Harry, Draco, and Hermione. But who is our Defense Professor?

      Came here to say this. It feels like RWBY/HPMOR crossover.

      Wonder what the ~~Semblances~~ signatures of the team would be, and how would they be munchkined.

      ^(silly prediction: partial transfiguration for SS, mind shenanigans for PP, troll regen/innocence aura for MM)

      Sanders seems far too interested in technical and scientific learning to be Harry, though. Also, Melanie is clearly reading as an escape mechanism more than because she loves learning things.

        And Draco is a normal kid who acts like a sociopath(in some situations) because of how he was raised.  

        Philip is a sociopath (or close to it) who acts like a normal person because of how he was raised.

  For all that Melanie claims to be aware of the distinction between fantasy and reality, she seems terrible at accounting for it
  ```

  - u/PeridexisErrant:
    ```
    Hey!  She's read books where the protagonist makes the distinction between fantasy and reality, you take that back.
    ```

  Excellent expansion of Melanie's chapter: she has much more grounding and periphery characterization now, matching the other two primary protagonists.

  That said:

  1) Some of the info at the start of the second section now feels redundant. Maybe shift it to the early part of the chapter, so that it doesn't rephrase what we've already gathered about her and her life.



  2) Her motivation feels like the weakest, when it should be the strongest. What I mean by that is I feel like there's lost potential here. Sander wants to be a Glimwarden because it "feels right," excites him intellectually, and for some lineage sentimentality. Phillip wants to be one for the potential challenges it contains, and possible power. Both are similar in that they don't *need* to become Glimwardens, but want to be.  They could do other things with their lives, their talents, and at worst are just bored with things as they are. Melanie, on the other hand, is fairly miserable with her life.  She should have a fire lit in her mind by the chance to become a Glimwarden. She should be barely restraining her eagerness in front of her aunt, biting her tongue at telling Sander that she will be one too. Not only is this her chance to become a heroine from one of her stories, even acknowledging that stories aren't like real life, it's also her one real chance to break the shackles of the inn...

  And yet she seems far too neutral, too reserved, for any of that to be felt. It makes her a less compelling character, in my mind, than she should be.

  You probably have a different character/arc for her in mind, or maybe she takes some time to develop into things, but for now my perspective is she can use the emotive boost early, if possible. Regardless, looking forward to the next chapters!

    At the risk of showing too much of how the sausage is made:

    Her inward sense of motive is the weakest mostly because of how she's built as a character. Her first thought on hearing the offer is "this is a way out", but her *second* thought is "I'm going to get fucked over somehow". Her first comparison is to a story where some patsy gets stuck between two forces more powerful than himself and crushed by them. This is a road forward, ergo there must be something wrong with the road.

    So yes, she's less compelling of a character right now, but I'm okay with that because that's part of who she is, part of where she's going, and part of how her temperament and philosophical outlook mesh with (and contrast with) the other characters. A Melanie that gets eager about things isn't the Melanie I need her to be.
    ```

      She's not the Melanie *Light's Hollow* needs. She's the Melanie *Light's Hollow* deserves.

  Hmm, some speculation on a time before lanterns and the first Glimwardens.

  If the darklings are as dangerous as as common as it seems, then it seems hard to imagine a world with darklings but without lanterns - they go together. A lantern can be used to create a shadow... so perhaps lanterns aren't just safe areas, perhaps they also create the darklings in the first place!

  I imagine it as a lantern being created as a weapon, a source of darklings - only those that survived found they couldn't turn the lantern off without dying to the darklings too. As time passes, for them to travel or expand their settlements they must create new lanterns; always with a ring of darklings around them.

  I'm probably wrong here, but it's fun to speculate :)

  Where has Sander been looking?

    Bah, I'll fix that. Thanks,
