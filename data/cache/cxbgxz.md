## Looking For Good Civilization Quests

### Post:

I've gotten really into Civ Quests on websites like spacebattles, sufficientvelocity and so on. I especially like the Quests where you control a burgeoning city/empire/whatever and you spread out into the galaxy. While I eventually wanna join in on playing these Quests, I'm happy to read already existing and/or finished ones. Can I get some recommendations for decently long Civ Quests?

  [Paths of Civilization](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/paths-of-civilization.36410/) is a rather long quest that may fit what you're looking for. At the start of the quest you are in control of a small tribe, but every few chapters the story time-skips to the next generation. The players get to choose the major actions of the civilization like which monuments to build, which tribes to attack/make alliances with, which technologies to focus on researching, etc. 

  That said, it hasn't reached the tech level needed to leave the planet yet, and the author may or may not have dropped it entirely.

  While writing this the importance of bookmarks became really apparent. Sorry for the less than useful parts.

  The first story I was going to recommend was one about a young-ish official in ancient China slowly building up power and later forming a nation. It used to be on the anonkun account of xingzhe traveller, but I cannot find it. There is an account named [xingzhe](https://fiction.live/user/xingzhe/stories), which *seems* to be the correct one, but I cannot find the story. Perhaps it was unlisted?

  Secondly, I recall enjoying a (complete, I think) civ quest by Mayuzane from *long ago*. It was pretty much exactly what you wanted: Small tribe until highly advanced civilization. Sadly, I could not find it, not helped by being unsure of where I read it. Might have been the Bay12forumsl, might have been alternativehistory… [Art of Domination](https://eagle-time.com/showthread.php?tid=1710) by the same author is also very good, but not quite a civ quest. An alien force it tasked to suppress an evil government. This starts a long campaign of conquering and (re-)building the planet, but things get stranger and stranger with time. Sadly, the original forum was taken down. While backups allegedly exist, they were never made public (nor did the owners deign to talk to the fans). A mostly complete archive of this adventure exists (see link), but the quest is mostly dead without the active forum.

  [House and Dominion](https://houseanddominion.fandom.com/wiki/House_%26_Dominion_Complete_Archive) is technically not what you seeking, but might interest you anyway. It’s a *really* long quest about young woman, and later young noble, in a far-future feudalistic space empire. Aspects of developing a nation are sprinkled through-out, though never fully the focus. As a commander, she has to keep building and improving her fleet. Later on she starts buying planets and developing them, but that is only one of the campaigns. There’s also some political intrigue and improving her noble house as a whole (much later on). Not a true empire builder at any point, though. (Still highly recommended.)

  If you just want laugh at ridiculous it is, you may also be interested in [Ogre Civilisation Quest](http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/archive.html?tags=Ogre%20Civilization%20Quest). Dead, but so whimsical and random that I don’t think it matters.

  I’ve also followed a few more recent civ quests, but they are all dead and not long enough to bother reading despite that. [Paradox of Choice: The Quest (Ulthuan Quest)](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/paradox-of-choice-the-quest-ulthuan-quest.16351/) was unexpectedly revived recently. You probably know that one already, though. You probably also know about [The Long NIght: Embers in the Dusk: A Planetary Governor Quest](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/the-long-night-part-one-embers-in-the-dusk-a-planetary-governor-quest-43k.10642/).
