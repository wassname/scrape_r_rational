## [D] Monday General Rationality Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics!  Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world?  Have you:

* Seen something interesting on /r/science?
* Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
* Figured out how to become immortal?
* Constructed artificial general intelligence?
* Read a neat nonfiction book?
* Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?

  After the US Presidential election I resolved to escape the bubble I was in and try to see the viewpoint of the other side without bias, only to find several popular opinions expressed among them horrifying either for their blatant prejudice or willful ignorance. The only thing more horrifying was the responses to such statements from their peers ranged from support to apathy with very little dissent. So now I'm tempted to retreat back into my bubble even though I know that would be irrational and unproductive.

    The problem with escaping the bubble is that 99% of the time you just end up looking in on a different bubble, where they talk about your original bubble like it's a fucking hellscape populated by demons. I think the best you can do is try to look at those other bubbles and ignore them when they talk about *other* bubbles - you only pay attention to internal bubble views, not external bubble views. But a whole lot of bubbles are entirely outward-facing, so sometimes that's all there is to understand.

    My personal solution is to cast myself as the skeptic and devil's advocate in whatever bubble I find myself in, which helps to eliminate some of the bad effects of the bubble, but is also exhausting and so not actually that great a solution.

      The hard part isn't understanding the perspective of other bubbles even if you disagree with them, the hard part is when you play the devil's advocate and nobody will listen. That makes me want to climb back into my own bubble and join in the demonization even if I know that I shouldn't.

    I think you've made the common mistake we all make of attributing the opinions of the few to the opinions of the many.

    For example, and with regard to our recent election, a lot of people from the democratic hugbox are claiming that, with Trump's victory, we've some legitimized a bunch of -isms, and some are even going so insanely far as to phrase as it as though a huge chunk of the country have peeled off face masks, put on their Grand Wizard costume, and spontaneously gathered in the town square with pitchfork, torch, and "burn the niggers, jews, and fags" signs, like some sort of twisted hate-musical number.

    Obviously, this hasn't happened. Hell, many people are rioting and protesting in states that voted very far left, which makes it hard for those individuals to claim to be on the moral high ground.

    But, if you stop and actually think, you'll realize that most people aren't "burn that thar nigger fag, pa". They don't wake up and say "God damnit, I hate people whose skin color is different from mine". Instead, they have a way of life they've grown used to, and tend to be wary of anything that represents a change to it.

    This is normal. This is evolutionarily beneficial, since in the ancestral environment a change to one's way of life could very well represent death for the individual or the tribe.

    This is why you get so many anecdotes from non-WASPs who hear something like "Those damn negros burned down some stores in [City]. They just aren't like you, (black) Mike. No offense, man." The known quantity, black Mike, is safe and familiar. The unknown quantity, the black Mike over in (city) who is part of a protest/riot, is an unknown quantity, and is quickly demonized for being different, other, and apparently dangerous.

    The solution to this should seem obvious, but to many people it isn't. The way to fix Jethro's wariness and dismissal or black Mike in (city) is education, not name calling, dismissal, and demonization.

    Yet, that's what we get. The country has become so partisan that, rather then reach out to people who wanted to vote for (candidate you don't support), we instead demonized and insulted them.

    So, you may go online, and see some idiot has posted "Now that Trump is president, we can purge the gays!".

    That person is both wrong, and an asshole. Firstly, we elected Trump President, not God Emperor for Life. Secondly, I woud wager that not that many people voted for Trump on a platform of -isms and -phobias. I would wager that many people voted for him DESPITE an apparent platform of -isms and -phobias, because the other option was Clinton, a politican who exemplifies the current status quo. A status quo that most were strongly dissatisfied with.

    A Trump presidency is a stick in the eye of the current established powers. It's something new. A terrifying new, with a madman at the reigns, but it's definitely shaken up the existing power structure.

    What we need now isn't demonization and partisanship. What we need now is to come together as a nation, and keep Trump the fuck in check with the checks and balances that our government is set up to have. We've stuck the stick into the powers-that-be's eye. Now we need to keep the body upright as we fix the brain and excise the cancers.
    ```

    - u/alexanderwales:
      ```
      Just as it's too early to say that Trump is going to execute all the gays (or whatever), it's also too early to say that Trump has shaken up the existing power structure. I said months before the election that Trump would select cronies and standard-issue Republicans, and that they would probably be the ones running things. I stand by that prediction, especially having seen Trump's opening moves (like appointing the head of the RNC as his chief of staff and Mike Pence as vice president).

      And if that's the case, then I don't think now is the time for coming together as a nation, because we'd be coming together behind policies that liberals have been against for decades, which, as mostly a liberal, I'm not going to do. And those same Republican policies are not at all amenable to checks and balances, not when Republicans control the Senate, the House, the executive, and soon the Supreme Court.
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        We don't need to come together behind Trump, I don't think. I personally think Trump is a loon, a monkey in the reactor room.

        I think we need to come together as a nation and a people, and continue to shake the tree of government until we shake as much curroption out as we can.

        Most people are not, inherently, good or bad people. Most people simply want to live a comfortable life, and with a informed self-interest want their neighbors to live a comfortable life, because they understand that a fire in your neighbor's house can very quickly become a fire in your house.

        Trump is likely going to do some stupid shit. We, as a nation, need to stand together and prevent it. He wants a wall? We vote no wall. He wants creationism taught in public schools? We vote no creationism. He wants to disband the EPA? We vote go take a long walk off a short pier into shark infested waters no.

        The politician class will always be composed mostly of the worst of us. The system is set up in such a way as that to seize power, one benefits much more from heartless, sociopathic actions then one does from kind, altruistic actions. As such, the system naturally selects the worst among us to rise to the highest positions. We, as the people these government officials are supposed to serve, are not limited by that. We can, and should, push for understanding, education, and altruism. If not for every man on Earth, then at least for our fellow man on this continent.

        I have to say, I am a bit disappointed to see tribalism in your refutation. You're not saying "Trump will appoint cronies who share his lunacy and sociopathic desire for power", you're saying "I, as a blue left tribe member, refuse to listen to anything that a red right tribe government says". There is no reason to do so. Democrat, Republican, Liberal, Conservative, whatever your damned color, you're at heart still human. People are global warming deniers not because they are somehow beneath us in intelligence, but because of faulty education. People are not anti-gay, racist, misogynist, misandrist, or any other -ism or -phobia because of some inherent factor that makes them irredeemably evil; they simply have a faulty education and a disinclination to question and empathize.

        The solution is not divisive "us vs them" tribal mindsets, but "us together" education and empathy.

          How are we going to come together and vote against a wall when half the nation very enthusiastically wants a wall? Moreover, how are we going to do that immediately following an election? I've been arguing against a wall since the Secure Fence Act on the basis that it's an expensive solution that doesn't fix the problem, I've voted against a wall to the extent that I was able to, I've written letters to my congresscritters about the wall, I've supported congresscritters who were against a wall ... and here we are, with a President whose rallying cry was "Build that wall!", so I don't know what else was expected of me, given that this ridiculous security theater has been going on for something like ten years now.

You're not saying "Trump will appoint cronies who share his lunacy and sociopathic desire for power", you're saying "I, as a blue left tribe member, refuse to listen to anything that a red right tribe government says".

          I am not saying that at all. I am saying that I *have already listened to the people Trump is going to select*. I already know Chris Christie's policy positions. I know Giuliani's. I've read speeches, I've watched debates, and then I rejected them on the grounds that most of what they say is simply not good policy - not policy that I feel is grounded in reality, or policy which is grounded in reality but which I feel prioritizes the wrong things. I'm perfectly willing to listen to the red tribe, but what I hear from the red tribe is a bunch of stuff that I disagree with ... which is why I'm in the blue tribe in the first place (which has its own stupid ideas I spend half my time arguing against).

            The people I spoke to didn't care much about the wall, most of them agreed that Trump had said absurd things they didn't support. They either voted for him anyway for similar justifications liberals had for Clinton in spite of her controversies, or they dismissed his rhetoric as grandstanding without concern for how it would effect his policy. 

            That wasn't all that reassuring to me and there are still some who adamantly support extreme positions who aren't being reined in by their peers, but there are plenty of moderates. I still disagree with many of the moderates about things I consider very important to agree on in order for our political system to do good, but they aren't all in agreement either.

              I have heard that:

              * Trump isn't going to build a wall, that's just his starting point for negotiation
              * Trump is going to build a wall, it's going to have Israeli anti-tunnel technology, it'll be 50 ft. high, etc.
              * Trump isn't going to build an *actual* wall, it's going to be a "virtual" wall using satellites, lidar, CCTV, etc.
              * Trump isn't going to build a wall, he's just selling himself to people who don't know any better in order to get elected

              And that's without getting into whether or not Mexico was going to pay for it or how.

                Don't forget that he might build a fence instead and/or only build it in some places. I'm not even sure conservatives in congress have a coherent plan at this point since even they didn't expect to end up in this situation. All anyone in the right agrees right now is that they are okay with Trump being in office and don't express interest in denouncing other supporters they disagree with, possibly because they see liberals as monolithic.

                This is either going to be the most easily malleable voter base in decades or the least and there's no way to tell. I have no idea whether they'll go along with anything Trump does, turn against him the moment he does something they don't like, or turn against each other when he does something that only some of them support. Western countries are all going through a massive populist movement right now and I don't know what will happen next.

They were almost all respectful to me as a person, but very few of them respected my beliefs and I felt the exact same way towards them. Even knowing that we both have reasons that seem rational from our perspective didn't make either of us more capable of coming together.

          I'm upvoting you because I think whoever downvoted you did so unfairly, but I think your comment, much as I agree with the spirit of it, is also unfair. He didn't stand upon a rock of "refuse to listen to the Red Tribe because they're Red," he specficaly said it's because he knows who these particular Red Tribe members are, what they represent, and why he opposes them.

      One specific comment I read, which I'm paraphrasing only slightly, was "I don't care what policies Trump implements so long as it causes liberals anguish. He could put forth a law that demanded the execution of every animal in every zoo, and I would back it 100% because of how pissed off it would make the liberals".

      Now, I don't give a fuck about animals, but that was one of the most legitimately evil comments I had ever read, simply because it proposes that *hurting people who disagree* is more important than anything else. That hurting other people is, in fact, a terminal value which sits above all others.

      I'm hesitant to repeat things like that, because I think pointing out the most horrible things just furthers the toxoplasma of rage, but it's one of the reasons that I decided that venturing out of my bubble wasn't worth it. I would rather just stay in my bubble and do work as resident skeptic and/or devil's advocate, so long as I don't have to see things like that.

        From the perspective of a gray who has been closely watching the red tribe bubble for a solid 8 years now, that line comes across as schadenfreude that expects to be taken as signalling/hyperbolic.  There is a train of thought that exists in the red/gray tribe that believes that nothing short of "a taste of their own medicine" will remind the blue tribe of the folly, of, say, weaponizing federal bureaucracies as tools of political oppression, or using bucketfuls of lies to push counterproductive policies that serve no purpose beyond attacking and harassing the other side (i.e. the gun control movement).  The blue tribe has shown very few scruples in regards to defecting while in power, so the red tribe is only shooting itself in the foot by, say, protecting the filibuster that blues were so recently willing to delete.  And frankly, I see more reds cautioning their own tribe on the folly of *that*, than I saw blues arguing for civilized restraint when they thought they were in for 40 years of one party rule.

        I see that line, and I can see how it comes off as evil in a vacuum.  But the most legitimately evil comments *I've* read *in the last three days* were calls for the rape and murder of all Trump supporters *and their families*, because that's just the appropriate thing for Red Army fanatics to do to Nazis.

      I want our community to avoid mind-killing politics, but I can't talk about this without revealing that I am a liberal who's been [talking to conservatives](https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/5c5utp/im_a_liberal_who_wants_to_try_and_bridge_the_gap/). Whatever you hear me say, please do not use it as an excuse to dehumanize your political opponents like I am tempted to.

      A big one is that they have a much narrower definition of racism than I do that precludes the existence of institutional prejudice, even while believing in implicit bias. They not only dismiss accusations of bigotry against a person or group that has not committed hate crimes, but they are convinced that being accused of such is itself a form of prejudice against them.

      I have spoken to people who politely explain to me their reasons, which they think are perfectly rational, for believing that white privilege does not exist in the US and reject my opposing viewpoint as either propaganda by demagogues or discrimination against them. I told them that I had been unfairly prejudiced against them and expressed interest in overcoming my biases, but they did not respond in kind.

      That's just one of them. Others reject laws I see as protecting LGBT people or a woman's reproductive rights as infringing upon their freedom to practice their own religion. I spoke to people who knew I am bisexual that some businesses should be allowed to refuse service to me because of what I am, and thought that didn't count as discrimination. They said my demanding to be treated equally was discriminatory against them.

      These are attitudes and beliefs that are considered acceptable in communities with opposing political views from mine, which in my communities are considered to be obviously immoral. I know that I should empathize with people who disagree with me and that will lead to the best possible outcome, but that's not what I feel like doing.

        Maybe you should lower you standards a bit. It's okay if you don't actually start agreeing with people with different opinions.

        Different opinions exist, and are held by rational-ish people with internally consistent beliefs, who are still wrong; being aware of that (actually aware, in a way that impacts your decisions) is already way above the sanity waterline.

          Out of all the people I spoke to on that thread, only one of them fulfilled the criteria you have. Few of them were disrespectful to me and only one directly insulted me, and I still find what they rest of them believe to be repulsive.

          It is only the user jub-jub-bird appeared to be rational, and even then we couldn't arrive at an agreement because our different definitions of problems resulted in support for different solutions that will solve them.

        That actually happens in real life? I thought it was just a punchline to a political joke. I wonder how people can even express that opinion without recognising the degree of moral myopia inherent in it.

          One guy described it as "only being allowed to practice my religion in church on Sunday". He says that he tolerates the existence of LGBT people and is fine with them getting married, but to force him to treat them equally is forbidding him to practice his religion in public and this belief didn't make him bigoted.

          Even after I explained how religious practice tends to be different in urban communities from rural and how the baseline liberal morality is secular humanism as a result, he still didn't budge. He then pointed out that has known very few LGBT people or hate against them, as if it would help persuade me.

    I'd recommend you just try again, harder. If your social circle is made mostly of people with the same political ideas as you, finding people with compelling opposite ideas is going to be hard.

    I'm not sure what you tried, but I'd recommend you avoid dealing with groups that identify as supporters of whatever position you're trying to understand. They're likely to wear their beliefs as a mantle, and if it comes down to a choice between being objective and self-critical, or showing their loyalty to the group, they're more likely to do the latter.

    I recommend looking for people in your extended social circle (colleagues, people who practice the same sports as you, etc); people who you're familiar with, but don't necessarily associate with you because of their similar tastes / outlook / social origins. Ideally, avoid public confrontations; actually, avoid confrontations as hard as you can: the closest a debate is to the "who is going to sound the most convincing?" format, the least you'll get out of it.

    Also, um, kudos for going in the right direction and all that :)

      Good advice in theory, but difficult to implement in practice. The only people I personally know who voted differently than me are family members I didn't like even before I found out their political beliefs. When I checked out subreddits that cater specifically to the other side, many top voted comments were espousing worldviews based on the rejection of information I consider factual. 

      Even those I spoke to who disagreed with the statements only expressed apathy towards them rather than righteous indignation. When I asked for insight into their logic behind their motives, they made it clear that they have the exact same view of my side as I do of their's and hold their own side in the same regard as I do of mine. Neither of us were able to convince the other of anything.

      I agree that it's possible in a "you will encounter such people in your life" way, but I don't think you should actually expect it, or even *treat it as a possibility*.

      There are a lot of non-evil people with beliefs that will *appear* evil to you, and few evil people. If you meet someone that sounds evil, odds are heavily weighted towards "immense and fundamental ideological divide" against "just evil".

These people don't have to be evil *me'Sinai*, in some handed-down-by-God-for-all-time sense, to be a material danger to me, my friends, and my loved ones.

        Go and reflect, let yourself step outside time for a few moments, and then tell me the history you would write for the world is one in which this many people are threatened and attacked, in which the whole of complex civilization is in danger, just because a shitty political party ignored the working class.  Can't you hear the hollowness of causal connection just in reading that sentence to yourself?  Doesn't this seem like a grimmer, darker world than we ought to be living in?

          I don't know. Clearly there's a point when you must admit that turning the other cheek isn't going to work, and that your enemy is dangerous and should be treated as an evil threat. I don't know where that point is, and I just... want it to be as far away as it can.

          I don't know. Sometimes people are hateful, they're bullies and thugs and they hurt people no matter how kind and sensible you are to them. I don't know how often that is, and I don't know how effective being reasonable really is. But what the fuck. Being angry and aggressive and brutal can't be better; people don't become less racist, less hateful or less thuggish when you shout insults at them. Maybe shouting insults at them, and generally tit-for-tat-defecting against them really is better, because it makes you win signalling games and makes their opinions unpopular; if think it's not, but it's way too fundamental a question for me to address it with more than my subjective experience and my gut feelings.

          Scott Alexander makes a much better argumentation of being nice to assholes than me in "In Favour of niceness, community and civilization", and I agree with all his points... yet I don't know if they're really valid, and not just wishful thinking and rationalizations of my inner bias. In the end, clever argumentations aside, I just have this deep belief: fuck defecting.

I don't want to fucking be there, especially because an authoritarian regime breaks down the signal precision of journalism and other information mechanisms, so by the time you're even close to that point you're relying on priors and very deeply uncertain.

            *But here we are.*

            I agree that shouting insults and derogating people who live on the other side of imaginary lines is counterproductive.  It constructs and reinforces those dividing lines.  I want my actions to be direct and forceful, to achieve my goals with the minimum of harm or insult.

            And I still think I can minimize insult.  Though if I ever find the asshole responsible for the "don't shoot and cry tears" slogan on the Israeli far-left I'm going to fucking beat the shit out of him/her as a demonstration of why you *definitely* cry after you shoot someone.  *That was a human life you just took*, and even if that harm, that violence, was the best you could do at the time, *it should never have come to that!*

            Of course most everything has *a* good point to it if you drill down far enough, but policies as a whole can very well be evil.

            Consider a game like Stellaris: You can settle planets in that game and sometimes there are natives on them. You may choose to purge those natives from the planet, and yes that might be objectively better for your people, but it's still an evil action to take, and other nations in it regard you as such for engaging in it. 

            This is not intended to be a direct comparison to any policies, merely hyperbole for the sake of making my point.

    There are reasonable Trump supporters out there, but I would contend that the vast majority of them simply hated Clinton more. Clinton and Trump each got fewer votes than Romney did. They were the 2 least favorable candidates for as far back as we have polls.

    The democrats chose to run someone who embodied the establishment, in an election where people wanted change. Obama won on change in '08 because people wanted the great recession fixed. The people in the midwest that lost their home and pension in '08 haven't recovered still- the only people to recover are those with homes or stocks. So in '16 the election is about change again, and Hillary vastly underestimated her opponent.

        What about all the institutional violence perpetrated by the current establishment? Record incarceration rates, dropping 20k+ bombs per year on 7 countries, arms deals with dictatorships, etc. Because those things are harder for me to tolerate than saying mean things.

        Don't get me wrong, I think Trump is a disaster, and it's going to be a deviation from the status quo. But I don't pretend like the status quo is good either, it has very ugly spots that need to change if our society is going to live up to its professed values.

          I do get the anti-establishment sentiment, that makes sense even if I don't agree with the actions they took. The problem I have is what they want to happen next seems to be mutually exclusive with what I want to happen next and even without practical considerations I can't find a way to reach a compromise between our interests when they either conflict with each other or are based on ideas the other side rejects the validity of.

            I think the solution is just to wait.  Be polite, but point out the human cost of every bloody piece of the agenda that they set out to do, then offer solutions that have a chance of working.  Repeat until you start to win hearts and minds.  Bonus points if you can find someone plainspoken and charismatic enough to sell it where needed.

              I did point out the human cost, specifically regarding their stance on LGBT rights, and they didn't listen. They claimed to be perfectly tolerant of gay people and saw no hypocrisy in their explicit belief that gay marriage should only be legal at the state level or that people should be allowed to discriminate against gay people for religious reasons. That was all after I mentioned that I was bisexual, so I'm finding it difficult to think of them as having hearts and minds.

                  Agreed, but this election was much more about personality than policy. We each voted for someone we thought generally represented our interests and values without paying much attention to specifics because there weren't more choices. This wasn't a good thing, mind you, but its what happened to both parties.

          With regards to the 20k+ bombs/drone programs, etc... I understand the reticence with regards to them, but I have read that the alternative, as far as interventionism goes (saying nothing about just... not, because I have no idea about how ideal that would be) would be putting boots on the ground, which according to multiple (unfortunately unsourced, or I would link them) articles I've read, drone strikes and bombing runs as such deal *less* civilian casualties and involve no threat to the U.S. military ground forces that would otherwise be at risk of casualties as well.

          Now, there is an argument to be given for the decision-theoretic drawbacks of having no real damages done to our nation by our efforts against others', but to make that argument would be anathema on a national political stage.

  Hey all, back again for an update on [my Singularity game.](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5bmlsq/d_monday_general_rationality_thread/d9pxhja/)

  I've made a rough sketch of the factions, and here's what I have so far:

  **Military Research Team**

  The Military's starting funding is the highest, at $10(billion). Their goal is a Sovereign AGI, which has the highest starting Risk of 99%.

  Their Passive Ability is that they get double the reward for researching technology with the "Military Applications" tag. This reflects their country's willingness to dish out more money for ancillary benefits related to their field.

  Their Active Ability is that they may cancel Sabotage cards by spending money equal to their cost. This reflects their ability to use other real world assets to keep their project and personnel safe.

  **Humanist Research Team**

  Starting funds are fairly low, at $4, and their goal is an Oracle AGI, which has the lowest starting Risk of 85%

  Their Passive Ability is that they win ties on bids when recruiting Researchers. Generally this reflects that people are more likely to want to work for them, so all else being equal, they're more likely to get good talent.

  Their Active Ability is that, upon making a trade of completed Research with other players, they can choose to stop either side from drawing a Sabotage card (which normally happens if two players make a trade of research or technology).

  **Private Research Team**

  Starting funds are fairly high, at $8, and their goal is a Genie, at the moderate starting Risk of 92%.

  Their Passive Ability grants them twice as much money from new Technology Research rewards, reflecting their better ability to leverage the advanced technology commercially.

  Their Active Ability lets them use an Action token to keep a temporary researcher on staff an extra turn (they still have to pay their minimum bid each turn).  Since researchers always provide at least one extra Action token, but can also have other bonuses, this can be a helpful way of extending benefits during a crucial period.

  **Revolutionary Research Team**

  Was going to call this the "Terrorist Research Team," back when Win Scenarios were fixed, but changed it to Revolutionary now that they're decoupled. Starting funds are the lowest, at $2, and their goal is a Genie AGI, at 92%.

  Their Passive Ability lets them continue to use Action Tokens after passing in a round. Normally once you pass you continue to get skipped for the rest of that round until everyone has passed and the next round begins. 

  Their Active Ability lets them spend an Action to take the top Sabotage card from the discard pile. Usually you get Sabotage cards by spending funds, and what you get is random: this gives them a cheaper alternative with some limited control.


  So those are the 4 factions I have in mind right now. The Win Scenarios used to be fixed to them, but now I'm thinking they'll be assigned randomly, or maybe people just get to pick between:

  Domination - You Win

  Transcendence - Everyone Wins

  Obliteration - Everyone Loses

  Not quite sure how that each play out yet. Will probably have to get to the playtesting phase to figure it out, but any feedback is welcome!

    What's a Sovereign AI?

    Also congrats on getting this far. Looks like you have a pretty good 4 player set-up here.
    ```

    - u/DaystarEld:
      ```
      As far as I understand it, the three (very rough) categories of AI can be classified as Oracle, Genie, and Sovereign.

      Sovereign is the one that acts completely independently. You give it goals and rules to follow, but past that, it just does whatever it feels it needs to within the confines you set to accomplish those goals.

    Have you heard of the game Alien Frontiers? Not to advocate plagarism, but some of its mechanics seem suited for this game. 



    How do you plan to publish?



    As far as ending scenarios go, it would be pretty cool to have something like the scenario booklet in Betrayal at House on the Hill, where you look up the conditions at end of game in a table, and are directed to a page explaining what happened. i.e. (Military  tried for a win and failed) && Obliteration && (some other random ephemera) -> "Your attempts at developing a 'smart' targeting system for a space-based missile targeting system end in failure, when your AI's objective function is stealthily rewritten by a mole in the research group with ties to a terrorist organization. The resulting satellite cannot distinguish between friendly and enemy air travel, but is smart enough to prevent itself from being remotely shut down. Travel by airplane becomes impossible for at least the next ten years. "

      Not thinking that far ahead yet, or I'll stall creatively. My talents lie in writing and design, so for now I'm just enjoying myself putting the ideas in my head down (and the numbers onto spreadsheets). If it gets to the point where I actually finish it, maybe I'll see if there's interest in getting it published too.

      (I've already designed one fully complete game, with a prototype and playtests and everything, but I lost motivation when I tried to look for an artist that wouldn't break the bank and faced the monumental marketing task of a kickstarter (which realistically needs an artist to have a good chance of getting funded).)

      >As far as ending scenarios go, it would be pretty cool to have something like the scenario booklet in Betrayal at House on the Hill, where you look up the conditions at end of game in a table, and are directed to a page explaining what happened.

      Yeah, I mentioned in a [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/55o2ah/d_monday_general_rationality_thread/d8cethq/) that it'll have a flowchart or something similar to describe bad outcomes, but I like the idea of making it tied to the type of organization you are too. I'm just wondering if having specific outcomes for your win condition can help people be more or less likely to form alliances or oppose one-another, rather than make it a clear free-for-all.

  Sometimes I feel like being too attached to your current epistemic state is the worst thing ever, but other times I think it's practical. I mean, as a human right now, work is a part of my utility function. I don't just do things because I want the end reward; effort is not anti-utility. But we also make things more efficient so that we have more time to expend on things that require less effort. I don't really envision a wire-heading scenario as the best thing ever, but doesn't that seem like the direction we're headed in?

  From [Scott Alexander's "Left-Libertarian Manifesto"](http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/12/08/a-something-sort-of-like-left-libertarianism-ist-manifesto/):
  >And my first thought was: if your job can be done more cheaply without you, and the only reason you have it is because people would feel sorry for you if you didn’t, so the government forces your company to keep you on – well then, it’s not a job. It’s a welfare program that requires you to work 9 to 5 before seeing your welfare check.

  I don't see how welfare programs (ie. basic income) factor into the existence of art and music. I get that, in the ancestral environment, we were much more at home with hobbies like that than working 9-5, but I don't know why we can't find the art in working. It certainly isn't a desire to be exposed to complicated and interesting problems, because there are plenty of productive jobs that do that!

  It seems kind of strange to say that humans like a *certain fixed* amount of complexity. (I'm using complexity in the sense of the distance N between the action and the reward) Like, too much complexity and the utility calculation ends up being negative, but we find the state of "eternal wireheaded bliss" to be *too simple* and *too rewarding*. Where's the cutoff line?

    I don't think that hypothetical major research program changes much; the researchers just fail or do what they wanted to do anyway.  In the short term it would drive up the price of private AI research, and in the long term it would lead to increased entry in the field because of increased prestige and salary.  The government also cannot legally pay salaries high enough to compete on salary for even the median DL researcher.

      ```

      - u/ZeroNihilist:
        ```
        I think it's a fairly big step from specialised AI to a general AI. A key intermediate step, at least by my limited understanding of the problem, is creating an algorithm that can learn to solve general problems without requiring manual tweaking of hyperparameters.

        So, for example, we have AIs that can outperform humans at Go and Chess, but it's not the same AI doing both. It's not impossible to create an AI that context switches between specialised networks, but that's not the same thing as an AGI (unless it's training the specialised networks and overseer itself).

        The other issue is that we currently train some of our AIs with manually compiled data. It's a very different beast to actually have one scrape its own data from the wild.

        That said, I believe that within 25 years there won't be any specific task that humans outperform AIs on, provided there's a metric for judging that (so art, writing, etc. would need a quality function first) and that it's not just because it's obscure.

        Hell, I have prosopagnosia so I'm quite used to being outperformed by computers at this task.

        Aside (obfuscated to minimise spoilers): I remember last week I was watching an episode of *Dr Who* where the Nth doctor has a faux-flashback to him doing some heroic deed in the past. I thought to myself, "of COURSE it's the Nth doctor who is in this flashback, never mind he has N-1 other forms he could have been in for this!". Much to my surprise two scenes later it turns out that the Nth doctor was remembering himself as the N-1th doctor doing that deed, as is demonstrated when something timey-wimey occurs and they are both in the same place at the same time. "OHHHHHH. They are different actors!" I say to myself, surprised by the totally-unsurprising-reveal. 

        And their respective actors [(](#s "Matt Smith and David Tennant")) aren't exactly twins. And each new Doctor *gets an entirely new outfit*.

        Oh, and I'm only *borderline* faceblind (3rd percentile). I weep for my lesser brothers and sisters.
