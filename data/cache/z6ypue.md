## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  [A thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/WormFanfic/comments/z8acjt/interested_in_branching_out_here_are_some_more/) just recently went up on r/wormfanfic by a user giving detailed recommendations of non-Worm web serials for people to branch out into. While I can't personally vouch for the works covered or the accuracy of the reviews, there's particularly detailed descriptions of 11 different works here with clear effort on the part of the reviewer, and this is posted for an audience that likely has some overlap with the interests of people in this subreddit.

    Redcoat_Officer writes pretty great stories himself, they're quite a bit outside the norm for Worm fanfics. His most famous is [Ghost in the Flesh](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/ghost-in-the-flesh-worm-love-death-and-robots-complete.819108/), which takes that womans-brain-piloting-cage-fight-monster "Sonnie" from Love Death and Robots and tosses her into Earth Bet, where she joins Faultline's Crew. Contrary to other Worm fics, which usually feature mostly teenagers, his stories predominantly focus on adults, mostly soldiers and mercenaries.

  I've recently been reading some older books and have come across *Euphorion* by Vernon Lee, which is about the Italian Renaissance and was written in 1884. I don't know whether the book is actually accurate as a book of history, but it is very entertainingly written, has a lot of charm, and is not as impenetrable as some of these old books can be (though it is still not overly light reading). I know very little about European history, and I can never understand opaque literary references to some poetry or the bible or whatever that apparently every learned noble was familiar with, but I still managed to follow along with the book. I definitely don't trust in or agree with everything written, and there are parts where the outdated nature of the book is very clear, but the author has a very interesting perspective.

  Both volumes, 1 and 2, are available for free online here:

  Euphorion - Vol. I by Vernon Lee

  I’d like to recommend two up and coming Youjo Senki fanfics:

  **A Young Girl’s Guerrilla War** (Youjo Senki/Code Geass)
  https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-young-girls-guerrilla-war-youjo-senki-saga-of-tanya-the-evil-x-code-geass.971950/page-185#post-86675163

  **A Young Vampire’s Guide to Cohabitation** (Youjo Senki/Dresden Files)
  https://m.fanfiction.net/s/14047826/1/

  Both are excellently written.
  ```

  - u/XxChronOblivionxX:
    ```
    Seconding *Guerilla War*, I've been following it for a while. One of the things that elevates it above most other Tanya fics is that she has a very real emotional stake in the cause she inserts herself in, she is not paying lip service to give herself a comfy job. She finds herself abandoned by the meritocracy of her previous lives, the racist bigotry of the Britannian power structures denies her any ability to climb a corporate ladder through intelligence and hard work, years of nothing but hard physical labor for the absolute bare minimum of food. She witnesses the destruction of Japanese shrines and finds herself offended by the desecration of her home culture. 

    Another thing is that the people around her actually start to detect her Tanya Misunderstanding Bullshit and call her out on it.
    ```

  - u/Missing_Minus:
    ```
    Both are pretty good. Cohabitation is also nice in that it manages to have the usual *misunderstandings* that Tanya has, while also keeping her competent (which a bunch of Youjo Senki fics fail at).
    ```

  - u/i_dont_know:
    ```
    Gonna derec *A Young Vampire’s Guide to Cohabitation*.

    I enjoyed it at first, but it grew increasingly grating, especially how it describes its women. 

    Disclaimer: not a big fan of Dresden files, but I’ve enjoyed a lot of fanfic of it.

    Edit: just read and enjoyed the first two chapters of *A Young Girl’s Guerrilla War* though!
    ```

    - u/netstack_:
      ```
      Does that mean that its "male gaze" is really similar to Dresden Files? Or is the style something else entirely?
      ```

      - u/chiruochiba:
        ```
        The opening paragraphs are fairly indicative of the rest of the story.

        >He opened the door slowly–Oh no. Inside his apartment, crouched down and softly humming as she stroked the oversized gray cat (Stars and Stones! That was cute) was one of the most physically attractive woman Harry had ever met, only rivaled by women who arguably weren’t exactly women at all. Hearing him entering, she stood smoothly and turned to face him—Damn! How did she suddenly get so tall?. His landlord’s reaction made much more sense now.

        >“Ah, welcome back, Mr. Dresden,” greeted the young Raith, curtsying slightly in greeting, despite wearing dress pants and a UChicago jacket, both looking a few sizes too small–damn it! Harry tore his gaze away from the unnaturally beautiful woman. Come on, don’t stare at the sexy vampire college girl!

        Suffice to say, the prose is downright cringey. I've read some of the Dresden Files novels, and the male gaze in this fanfic is, without a doubt, less subtle/suave than the Dresden Files novels.
        ```

  - u/Dragongeek:
    ```
    Do you need to know what *Youjo Senki* and *Code Geass* are to enjoy the fics?
    ```

    - u/AsynchronousAtom:
      ```
      Not really? I can give you the spark notes summary if you want. Code Geass, if you reduce it down to the barebones, is set in a world dominated by the Britannian Empire, an alternate world British Empire which believes in social Darwinism and has conquered Japan for its rich mineral resources. The Japanese people are oppressed and little more than slaves, and are trying to rebel against their conquerers. There are themes of imperialism and other stuff.
      ```

      - u/lillarty:
        ```
        >has conquered Japan for its rich mineral resources

        Probably relevant to note that the map of Code Geass is similar to the one from Orwell's *1984*. A [map](https://i.imgur.com/mUhNQ4h.png) in the show demonstrates that Britannia (blue) controls the Americas, \~80% of Africa, Russia, Spain, and France. Ironically, Britannia (the empire) does not control Britannia (the islands). Just to add more context to the overwhelming task that would be rebelling against such a superpower. 

        Australia is never once mentioned in any Code Geass media, and is presumed to be a lifeless wasteland.
        ```

      - u/eniteris:
        ```
        > has conquered Japan for its rich mineral resources

        I had to do a double take and some research because Japan (in real life) doesn't have many mineral resources at all.

        It's Sakuradite, unobtainium that's big in (Code Geass) Japan.
        ```

        - u/AsynchronousAtom:
          ```
          Lmao yeah that’s what I meant but out of context someone who hasn’t seen code Geass doesn’t know what it is. I prob should have explained that it’s used for mecha.

    Seconding Guerrilla War, binged it last night. It's the only Youjo Senki fic I've read that treats Tanya and other characters equally as persons, and has all characters develop and grow organically because of interactions with each other.

    If anyone knows more YS crossovers with such great approach to characters, let me know!
    ```

      * Jacobk's [A Young Woman's Marvelous Adventure](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-young-womans-marvelous-adventure-youjo-senki-mcu.944975/), an MCU crossover which was briefly revived earlier this year, is decent but not as good as his [A Young Woman's Political Record](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-young-womans-political-record-youjo-senki-saga-of-tanya-the-evil.660569/). The latter doesn't meet your requirements since it's not a crossover, but it's very nicely done and complete.

      * [Shoulder Devil](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/shoulder-devil-youjo-senki-naruto.821249/) is a pleasant little Naruto crossover which seems to be on life support.

      * [A Little Girl's Rap Sheet](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-little-girls-rap-sheet-tanya-the-evil-worm.666136/) is a decent Worm crossover in which Tanya is reborn as the daughter of a Fallen cape.

      You might enjoy [A Kaiserin's Post-Living Arrangements](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-kaiserins-post-living-arrangements-youjo-senki-fate-crossover.833232/), which is a Youjo Senki and Fate/stay night crossover. The fanfic branches off from the ending of "A Young Woman's Political Record" with the idea that the Fate series is set in the future of the same universe.

      Tanya passed away after a full life, beloved as the "Silver Chancellor" of Germania, or "Kaiserin" to some. Her renown would only grow after her death, particularly in the Akitsushima Empire (Japan) whose citizens still remembered her benevolence in their time of need. Half a century later, Tanya finds herself unwillingly summoned into the role of a Heroic Spirit to serve in the Fifth Holy Grail War in Fuyuki City.
      ```

      - u/TouchMike:
        ```
        Oh, I thought Political Record was abandoned — guess I'll have to finish that one first. I'm not too familiar with Fate/stay Night, but perhaps the crossover forces some necessary explanation.  
        Thanks for the rec!
        ```

        - u/chiruochiba:
          ```
          To be honest, I've never played/watched any of the Fate series; I'm only vaguely familiar with it from reading random fanfics. I can't comment on whether this fic does a good or bad job of explaining the setting since I just looked things up on the wiki whenever I wanted to know more.

  For those looking for a good time-loop style game, check out "I Was a Teenage Exocolonist" ([https://store.steampowered.com/app/1148760/I\_Was\_a\_Teenage\_Exocolonist/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1148760/I_Was_a_Teenage_Exocolonist/)). I picked it up on Saturday and I have amassed 18 hours on it so far, so I thought I'd give it a shout out.  


  You play as a child growing upon Earth's first exocolony through the ages of 10 to 20, along with various other colonists - each year has 13 months in it, and you get to pick what activity to do each month (kinda like a stat-raising sim, while a card-matching game where the cards are based upon the activities undertaken is used for the gameplay portion of the game). Events happen both based on the activity you do, as well as according to the default script, and these cumulatively advance the plot.

  Building a new colony is tough, and tension in the story comes from 1. the mysterious ecology of the planet, 2. the struggles of food, housing, and defence against the hostile fauna in the planet, and 3. interpersonal conflicts between the characters in the colony. Transhumanist themes play a large role throughout the story, with genemods, xenobotany, and post-scarcity politics featuring heavily in both the gameplay and story. (We learn early in the game that the colony ship and the player character's family were part of a group attempting to escape the dystopian hellscape 22nd century Earth had become)

  Speaking of the characters, most of them are really fleshed out, with nearly all of the romance options (certainly all of the 'childhood companions' at the very least) being much more in-depth than expected.

  Because this game takes place over a decade of the player's life, something really cool that happens is the tonal shift between childhood (where the adults of the colony rationally attempt to conceal the harsh realities of colony life from the children), adolescence (where dating and hormones are a thing, and characters start to drift apart from their childhood companions), and early adulthood, whereby life on an alien planet forces the main character and his childhood friends to grow up faster than normal.

  The catch is that your character is partially aware of the nature of the player's ability to quicksave/load, and gets this future knowledge in the form of flashbacks that unlock new dialogue options whenever the player has encountered something the character has not yet encountered in this life. 

  This segues nicely into what I felt was a key highlight of the game - the choices. Choices really do seem to matter here, with 29 "main" endings and various permutations to these endings based on your relationships with the other characters and your romance interests. While I cannot speak as to how good all the romance events are, the characters who i did romance (Tangent and Marz) did have pretty good stories.

  Can anyone recommend a good work or three which feature intelligent use of limited precognition? Something similar to how Dinah Alcott's power is used in Worm.
  ```

  - u/Auroch-:
    ```
    [Fall of Doc Future](https://www.tumblr.com/docfuture/82363551272/fall-of-doc-future-contents) starts with Doc's precognition method starting to fail due to overload, and its sequels deal with other means, mostly *less* limited but all with specific (though not always promptly-explained) limits. More similar to Coil's precognition (WoG says it's technically precognition executed very weirdly) than Dinah's, though.
    ```

    - u/thomas_m_k:
      ```
      Would you recommend the sequels? I read the first book a while ago and I really enjoyed it; especially the parts with Stella and Doc Future (and >!Yiskah!<), but the parts with >!Skybreaker!< And Donner not so much. The title of the second book makes me think the focus will mostly be on the latter. Is that the case?
      ```

      - u/Auroch-:
        ```
        Book 2 is about the same split; book 3 is more Flicker-focused (and incomplete). They're all among my most favorite stories, though, so I don't have great calibration on what you'll think.

    You might be interested in the precognitive abilities in [The Menocht Loop](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/31514/the-menocht-loop).

    'Regret practitioners' have the ability to create short  loops of perceiving the future, lasting from seconds to minutes depending on skill level. When the practitioner activates their ability the world proceeds around them as it would naturally, affected by whatever actions the practioner chooses to take, then when the ability ends, everything snaps back to the moment that the ability was activated. A powerful Regret practitioner could run hundreds of consecutive loops in the space of a second.

    In practice, Regret practitioners typically use their ability for intel gathering, forewarning of imminent dangers, and directing battlefield tactics. This can get complicated when both sides of a conflict utilize Regret practitioners who then wind up iterating off of each other's changes from moment to moment, loop to loop.

    ```
    You might like Alex Verus, an urban fantasy similar in concept to Dresden Files except Alex is British and has the power to see the future a few seconds in advance. It's not exactly rational, but Alex does have some fun uses of seeing the future a few seconds in advance which makes the story different from a typical urban fantasy.

  I was recently looking for free audio-format stories, and I stumbled across this wiki page (https://old.reddit.com/r/HFY/wiki/ref/audio) where people have created recordings of popular HFY stories... but it's very cumbersome to navigate since the alphabetical listing combined with reddit's abysmal search function make it particularly difficult to find anything worthwhile. 

  Does anyone know of anything on this list that not only has a good narrator, but also a good story of decent length (>50k words minimum)? How about audio outside of this list?

  As for recommendations in the genre of "free audio online" I still think [Sam Gabriel's](https://www.samgabrielvo.com/) stuff is the gold standard, especially the Alexandria Quick series. He's a phenomenal narrator and the quality is at and often exceeding that of actual paid for audiobooks.

  I binged a new seasonal anime yesterday and it completely entranced me: **Bocchi the Rock**. It’s a CGDCT music comedy, but it’s so much more than just that.

  Now I’m basically completely ignorant about music, and I don’t really care for comedy, CGDCT, or SOL, but Bocchi the Rock is beautiful. It follows an extremely introverted girl with social anxiety out the wazoo who wants to join a band and play rock. The gags are [hilarious with amazing and unique visuals](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=z3IA5X2tfR0), and the story, character growth, and musical performances are just as stellar to boot. While her social anxiety is pretty exaggerated, there are parts that any introvert of any flavor can heavily relate to. A lot of the social anxiety gags are so specific that it felt like the creators were really there before.

  You really see Bocchi grow and come out of her shell throughout the episodes due to her friends and rock, with even their performances building up on it. I won’t lie, the performances we had so far were so good they almost made me cry. They really highlight the band’s growth, their ups and downs, and how far Bocchi herself has come. 

  And according to what others say, the animation is extremely accurate to what it’d be like actually playing those instruments, with even the finger placements corresponding correctly. The camera angles, the little movements of the characters, the attention to detail is perfect. The anime really dives into the music and band angle of things, showing things like dealing with ticket quotas, the struggles of being a new and amateur band, and the like. Bocchi's dog is even named Jimihen!

  The imagery and detail is absolutely phenomenal. There’s so many little things, and I miss so many of them if they’re not pointed out to me. I don’t want to vomit too many words here and go on unnecessary tangents, but each episode is so rich in them. Keep a keen eye on the final character interaction of episode 8, there's so much imagery used to further highlight their differences and their bonds.

  All in all, it’s a beautiful and heartfelt anime of an introvert trying to find friendship and express herself through rock. I haven't mentioned any of the other characters to not spoil the magic, but the interactions between them are sweet and charming, especially a particular one at the end of the latest episode. I know nothing about music, but even I could see the passion, attention to detail, and beauty in this anime.

    It seems like what will eventually be packaged into the first two books is complete, with a third in sight. AW did say that he was going to wrap it up, but it seems so far like it'll keep going for at least one more book. He started posting 16 months ago, which would make 8 months per book, so 8 more months if there's going to be another book. If not, then I expect it'll be mostly done by the end of the month.

  I’m also gonna have to recommend **SAPR** (RWBY/MLP), by ScipioSmith. I can only describe it as “epic grand fantasy meets RWBY. The protagonist is Sunset Shimmer from EqG, characterized as an arrogant girl who believes in her destiny to rule. She has a tendency to speak dramatically, and the author is clearly experienced in writing high quality fiction (he’s an actual author). It’s an excellent story all around. https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/sapr-rwby-mlp.674638/

  On the topic of RWBY fanfics, **Red Thorn** (RWBY/Samurai Deeper Kyo) is also amazing, and has a similar premise to Matters of the Heart - Ruby is coddled by her father after nearly dying, and her overprotective father seeks to lock her away and crush her ambitions to become a huntress. Ruby runs away and masters the sword with a wandering swordsman. https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13453490/1/Red-Thorn

  There is also **Queen of Air and Darkness**, a fic following an AU Jaune from a storied huntsman lineage descending from Joan of Arc, a legendary warrior maiden who travelled with the first King of Vale. He is characterized as highly pragmatic and intelligent, and suffers great tragedies throughout the story. https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13517827/1/Queen-of-Air-and-Darkness

  The world building, pacing, grammar, writing quality, and even word count of all of these stories are top tier in my opinion.
  ```

  - u/godlyvex:
    ```
    Is SAPR readable without any RWBY knowledge? MLP is easy to get the gist of, but I've never touched anything RWBY related.
    ```

    - u/AsynchronousAtom:
      ```
      Yeah it’s pretty easy to hop into without much prior knowledge. RWBY is set in a world where monsters known as “Grimm” roam, and human warriors called Hunters must cull the Grimm population periodically and protect human settlements. There are four main human kingdoms (Vale, Vacuo, Atlas, Mistral), and Hunters have access to a power called Aura, which acts like a forcefield. Each Hunter also has one unique power called a Semblance.

      Sunset Shimmer doesn’t have a semblance, but passes her magic off as an extremely versatile semblance (since a semblance is typically very limited in scope of application). When she goes through the mirror portal in her homeworld of Equestria, she emerges into the world of RWBY, and is stuck there.

      Trust me, you’ll love Sunset’s characterization. It blew me away how complex and how well written she was. She has a quiet and noble pride, just like Vegeta from Dragon Ball, and quickly grows on you. She is also VERY charismatic. When she speaks, there are times when you just want to listen.

  I'm recommending [Metamancer](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/59514/metamancer-a-hard-progression-fantasy) by OscarWilder on Royal Road.

  It starts as a better-than-okay military Isekai where an ex-marine with a pregnant wife gets teleported to a fantasy world. I started to like it when our hero is interrogated by a Tribune with a magic lie-detecting ring: "I'm not from this world. I was transported here. I don't know why. I just want to go home to my wife and unborn child." The last sentence was a lie.

  That's some good bite.

      I think he does address that, but I'm not sure if I remember it correctly. I think it's "whether or not it is believed by speaker"
