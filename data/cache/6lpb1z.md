### Post:

## Last Time

[Last time,](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6iqyxi/biweekly_challenge_barrier_maiden/) the prompt was "Barrier Maiden", and our winner was /u/ShiranaiWakaranai, with [their story, "Stars in the Night Sky"](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6iqyxi/biweekly_challenge_barrier_maiden/dj8li7r/). Go read it now, and /u/ShiranaiWakaranai, congratulations on your win!

##### This Time

This time, the challenge is **Quantum Suicide and Immortality**. [See the wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_suicide_and_immortality) if you have no idea what that is or need a refresher. Strict adherence to actual quantum physics is welcome but not expected, so long as the stories rules are consistent. Remember that prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

The winner will be decided **Wednesday, July 19th.** You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

##### Rules

* 300 word minimum, no maximum. Post as a link to Google Docs, pastebin, Dropbox, etc. **This is mandatory.**

* No plagiarism, but you're welcome to recycle and revamp your own ideas you've used in the past.

* Think before you downvote.

* Winner will be determined by "best" sorting.

* Winner gets reddit gold, special winner flair, and bragging rights. Five-time winners get even more special winner flair, and their choice of prompt if they want it.

* All top-level replies to this thread should be submissions. Non-submissions (including questions, comments, etc.) belong in the companion thread, and will be aggressively removed from here.

* Top-level replies must be a link to Google Docs, a PDF, your personal website, etc. It is suggested that you include a word count and a title when you're linking to somewhere else.

* In the interest of keeping the playing field level, please refrain from cross-posting to other places until after the winner has been decided.

* No idea what rational fiction is? [Read the wiki!](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index)

Also, if you want a quick index of past challenges, I've [posted them on the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/weeklychallenge).

##### Next Time

Next time, the challenge will be **Moore's Law**. Moore's Law is the observation that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles roughly every two years. It is widely considered to be a driving force in technological change. In theory, paying the same . Similar observations have been made for things other than integrated circuits, such as quality adjusted price for IT equipment. [See Wikipedia for more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law#Other_formulations_and_similar_observations). Stories for this prompt do not necessarily need to be science fiction, though ideally parallels are relatively. Remember that prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

**Next challenge's thread will go up on 7/19.** Please private message me with any questions or comments. The companion thread for recommendations, ideas, or general chit-chat [can be found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6lpeqt/challenge_companion_quantum_suicide_and/).

  (In hindsight, this would have been a more appropriate prompt for my very first submission, '[Consolidation](http://pastebin.com/QXYtSXmL)' (prompt '[Precommitment](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3nwfh6/biweekly_challenge_precommitment/)')--I relink it here in case it's of prompt-related interest to someone who hadn't read it before.)
