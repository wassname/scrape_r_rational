  This was good.  I'm glad to see that we have consistent tension and the intrigue isn't dropping off.  Compared to a lot of other shonen manga currently serialized, TPN is really what I look forward to every week.

    TPN is the only shonen manga that I read.

  That was quick. Were the raws leaked early this week?

  Alright, Krone alleges having next to no information about the outside world, so Minerva is still relevant. They still haven't gotten around to decrypting the useful parts of his message, whatever that is. The unstated "we both know that we both know" is as entertaining as always.

  And here are some omakes (extra short strips that are usually humorous): http://mangastream.com/read/neverland/Extra/3927/1

    That's far too adorable. It is now part of my personal canon.

  I wonder what Krone lied about that the children didn't catch.

  Krone knows that destroying the tracker will send off an alert (presumably since it will stop sending a signal). It seems weird that she says it shouldn't send an alert if you cut off the earlobe. Maybe these trackers aren't that sophisticated, but this could also be one of Krone's lies.

  Okay, I finally got around to binge reading this thing, and wow this is good. The logic and reasoning behind everything is really pretty solid - only the conclusion about there being a traitor felt like it was pulled out of thin air to me. The rest really made me feel like I was part of the group, trying to figure things out as it went along.

  The pacing and tension is really good too. Very curious to see where this is heading - I'm hoping this will eventually progress to them dismantling the demon invasion itself, somehow. 

  (Also, I keep imaging HJPEV as being one of the kids in this school. Anyone else think a crossover would be pretty sweet?)

    50/50 odds that he gets eaten, unless he's learned that he isn't as smart as he thinks he is. He's a little too cocky in the beginning of the story.
