  Yes, I'm still alive: sorry for the long wait, I expected to get this out much earlier until life sort of blew up. I'm heading out of the country for a couple weeks soon, and decided to knuckle down to finish it before I go.

  Still playing around with a number of things, like capitalization of "pokemon" and the way to reference real concepts in a fictional world. Any feedback is appreciated!

  Awesome! Also, if you run out of fic, consider [Game of Champions](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7354757/1/), though it is more Grimdark Realist Pokemon than Rational Pokemon.

    Thanks, I'll look into it :) My reading list is backlogged pretty bad at the moment, and I'm trying to make time for Worm too...

  Question: For someone who knows nothing about Pokemon, is it worth reading this fic? How much prior knowledge does it assume?
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:

    Honestly, as there's no connection to our world at all, it probably won't be particularly "engaging" to someone not interested in the Pokemon world.  The only real prior knowledge it assumes is that you know the basic concept of what pokemon are ("magical" monster that take the place of animals) and how humans interact with them (capture them in pokeballs to protect themselves or battle with others), but I also don't go into detail describing every pokemon that shows up, and many of the "rational" parts are dissections of the irrational aspects of Pokemon.

    That said, I would be interested to know what someone who knows nothing of Pokemon makes of the fic, so if you do read it I'd love your feedback :) If anything, just googling each Pokemon that shows up should cover the majority of what confusion you may have.
