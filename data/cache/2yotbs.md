## I have an interesting piece of magic/technology I plan to include in my next story. What are some reasons I SHOULDN'T post it here?

  * You'll remove some of the thrill and wonder from your readers, assuming that they read the discussion first.
  * You'll (possibly) remove some of your own enjoyment from writing about it
  * You'll dilute discussion about the cool thing by having it be split into two places

  There are some secondary concerns, but those are the big ones in my opinion. In return, you get some feedback about the magic or technology, which can be helpful in pointing out flaws, or helping you think up new things to do with it.

  Depends on how critical what you post is to your book, specifically in relation to how much of a spoiler it is. Even then, it shouldn't be too big of a deal. Unless your entire climax hinges on something you explain in your post.

  If I like it, I'll use it to take over the world.

  It decreases the value of your book to anyone who reads said post.

    It might. If it's something that is well known in-universe it may not.

  No reason not to, really. You'll get down voted if we don't think it fits. I think the readers of this subreddit are looking for intelligent characters more than holding to any definition of rational fiction. If your character is smart, that's good enough to at least get our opinions
