## [D] Annual “Romance in Rational Fiction” thread

### Post:

Happy Valentine’s Day, /r/rational. This thread is for discussion of romances and romantic elements in rational, rationalist, or rational-adjacent fiction in text or other media. Preferably from the past year, but you can talk about any story you wish. Also, this isn’t an actual official thread or anything, you can talk about this topic anytime. I just like doing it today.

  It is a travesty that no one has yet talked about the fantastic sci-fi romance [Always Human](http://www.webtoons.com/en/romance/always-human/1-i-guess-thats-why-i-admire-her/viewer?title_no=557&episode_no=1). Everything about that story is beautiful and this couple should be held up as an exemplar of how to properly communicate in a relationship. [Read my full pitch here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6t1qn5/d_friday_offtopic_thread/dlhfiz5) (yes I finished it and the only thing I was disappointed by was the fact that it ended)

    How worth it is the music?  I just read the first page and love the art style, then at the bottom I found out there's music!  Must not be working on mobile.  Anyway, how hard should I try to fix the sound issue, in your opinion?

    Edit: I found the button to turn on the music XD It's very subtle, I like it.

    Read it from the same rec thread months back; very much worth and very enjoyable. Beautifully done romance that felt very moving, grounded and realistic and also involved transhumanist elements without being an action/sci-fi/adventure story. That's rare. It also focuses on a same sex couple, which was a refreshing read as well as I don't often experience media with same-sex couples as the thrust of the story. Can't recommend enough.

    I just read it in one go. Thank you for the recommendation. It is a lovely story with great art and well-executed characterisation.

  Although I’m sure there are others, my personal favorite work was Wildbow’s *Twig*. This story had many, many excellent romantic moments between various characters, and the webserial format slowed the slow burn grow into more intense scenes. The story is a great case of a mastermind trying to optimize for happiness despite the conflicting desires and love polygons which occur.

  [Spoilers Mistborn:](#s "Vin and Elend's relationship in Mistborn. It's so close to being a stereotypical prince-and-servant-girl romance, but their precise combination of skittishness and social ineptitude makes their dance fascinating to watch, and their eventual coupling all the more heartwarming and realistic.")

  [](#s "Also, Sazed and Tindwyl is a tragic and beautiful story.")

    Sazed in general was the best part of Mistborn. His existential crisis really drove the plot for me at times.
    ```

      I know some people didn’t like the end of his arc, but speaking as someone who is religious and struggled with my psychological need for religion, his journey really resonated with me.

      As someone who’s always identified with book smart characters like him that support the heroes, I also found the end of the trilogy *super* satisfying for completely subjective reasons.
      ```

      - u/LazarusRises:
        ```
        Wow I have never heard anyone badmouth Sazed's arc! I'm agnostic, and I agree: it is a deeply satisfying conclusion for a marvelous character. I can imagine how it would affect a religious reader.
        ```

        - u/trekie140:
          ```
          The only criticism I’ve heard about him was on the Rationally Writing podcast, where both the guys were atheists who were raised in conservative religions. They never sympathized with Sazed’s philosophy even if they thought he was well-written and made sense in the context of the Lord Ruler’s oppression, so they didn’t find the conclusion to his arc very satisfying.
          ```

    - u/Kishoto:
      ```
      I can say I definitely didn't see the conclusion of his arc coming at all. Completely caught me by surprise.
      ```

  I think that the big thing people don't realise about romance is that you *can* do it rationally - the "I CAN EXPLAIN!" moments in romcom are the prototypical example of "thorin throwing down the key", but there are plenty of romance shows and storylines that include people having adult conversations about their feelings and treating their partners with respect / etc. I recommend *Jane the Virgin* - which is not rational in plot, I stress - for this sort of rationality. Also it's absolutely hilarious.

  I made a comment on this thread last year actually: https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5u4cku/d_its_that_time_of_year_again_discuss_romance_in/ddrirq8/ about my supernatural romance story (that I am still editing! it turns out writing something is REALLY HARD and what I thought was a mostly finished 30k word story in February 2017 is now a mostly finished 60k word story a year later, so go figure. I'd be happy to release a few chapters now but I haven't got enough in the tank to have a consistent release schedule unless I did it like monthly or something). 

  Like I've been saying since then and before then, though, I hope the genres that people write about in a Rational sense / post stories of become more varied over time.

  This was mentioned 2 years ago, but [Lighting up the Dark](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9311012/1/Lighting-Up-the-Dark) has some of the best romance I've seen in a rational fanfic. There's not a whole lot of it overall, but what's there is pretty moving I thought.
  ```

- u/LopeLopez:
  ```
  I highly recommend The Fall of Doc Future [http://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/82363551272/fall-of-doc-future-contents]; well thought, rational science fiction in which people in relationships talk to each other.

    >in a superhero story with magic

    That's not science fiction, bro. At best, it's speculative fiction.

  In response to u/OnePunchFan8, whose [comment](http://np.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7xkwi8/d_annual_romance_in_rational_fiction_thread/du92r50/) the eternally-hated moderators have removed:

  > Sounds like a oxymoron.

  \- If an oxymoron works at all, it does so by subverting expectations.  
  \- Subverting expectations is fun.  
  \- Therefore, making oxymorons work is fun.

    In less than a month it will be three years since HPMOR ended.

  Seconding Twig and Mistborn! would also like to shoutout Unsong's chapter 5 as an excellent chapter, with aaron's deliberately irrational habanero-eating for Ana
  ```

- u/nick012000:
  ```
  Depending on your definitions of "rational fiction" and "romance story", the Monstergirl Encyclopedia books could qualify. It certainly meets the definition of "rational fiction" in the sidebar, at least.
