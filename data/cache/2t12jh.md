  Any recommendations of stories that actually do this realistically? And I don't mean stories that provide good excuses for little change. I mean stories that have the future culture as different and alien as one would expect, while still being an enjoyable read that isn't *just* about said future cultural difference.

    I am mildly surprised that no one has mentioned one of the author's own books, like *Accelerando*, *Singularity Sky*, or *Glasshouse*. Charles Stross (/u/cstross) is generally really good about that sort of thing.

    Some good examples:

     - Anathem by Neal Stephenson

     - Czarne Oceany by Jacek Dukaj (it was supposed to be translated to English, but I can't find translation anywhere, here is summary http://www.terminally-incoherent.com/blog/2012/02/10/black-oceans-czarne-oceany-by-jacek-dukaj/ - it is deliciously strange and has record novel ideas per page ratio)

     - Algebraist by Ian Banks (at least the Dwellers species)
    ```

    - u/PeridexisErrant:
      ```
      Also *Surface Detail*, by Iain Banks.  And most other *Culture* novels, I guess...
      ```

  - u/Putnam3145:
    ```
    [Eliezer Yudkowsky's Three Worlds Collide](http://lesswrong.com/lw/y4/three_worlds_collide_08/) is the best at this that I've read myself.
    ```

      May I ask why?  To me the differences between the three races seemed like authorial fiat instead of believeable evolution...which is fine, since it wasn't a story about worldbuilding, it was a story about utility function calculations and subjectivity of morality.  Good story, just not believeable aliens.
      ```

      - u/Putnam3145:
        ```
        I wasn't talking about the aliens much at all, just the humans.

        Also, my language was specifically built to be relative, heh. "Best I've read myself" as opposed to anything like "really good". I don't actually read much science fiction, most of what I've read is whatever I could find on wikisource, heh.
        ```

- u/None:
  ```
  Read *Dune* if you want to actually feel culturally estranged.  I suspect one of the reasons cultural estrangement isn't done more often in "futuristic" fiction is that the author doesn't want the reader throwing the book across the room shouting, "YOU'VE BACKSLID ON EVERYTHING BY HUNDREDS OF YEARS!"
  ```

- u/None:
  ```
  I somewhat agree, but I think it's very, very hard to do properly as anything other than an experiment.
  ```

- u/thakil:
  ```
  I don't think he's entirely wrong, although I think he's a little hard on Hamilton, who I think makes some effort in building broadly plausible future worlds (and then fills it with his heroes having all the sex they want, but that's another issue...) with a blend of different ideas. One of the protagonists in Pandora's Star is an old school socialist disgusted that human kind has gone to the stars and built the same damn society it's always built.
  ```

  - u/sephlington:
    ```
    Also, the entire Commonwealth's reaction to Huxley's Haven. Paula Myo isn't exactly an insignificant character, and very few people are comfortable with the ideals espoused by The Hive.
    ```
