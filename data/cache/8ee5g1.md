  What's this? A Scar's Samsara sequel? Oh boy, tell me it's so!

  I never intended for Scar's Samsara to continue, but gosh this stuff is just too much fun to write. This story picks up where the last one left off, except one generation later. It's very roughly based on The Lion Guard, which is basically The Avengers set in the Pridelands, but I don't actually expect anyone to watch that show so just jump right in and enjoy!

  Scares Samsara is one of my favorite finished works I've found through this sub so I am eagerly await what you'll do with the sequel! I have places I hope the story goes but I'll refrain from posting them until we get more plot.

    Thanks! I have to admit I'm very proud of Scar's Samsara too - if only because I actually finished it. This story has a somewhat lighter atmosphere (at least at start) and of course a very different protagonist, but you're right: You'll find out more soon enough :)

  Looks interesting, and I liked the first story. I haven't actually seen the Lion Guard series though, will I still be able to follow along?

    Yes, absolutely! I don't count on anyone having watched the show, so no prior knowledge whatsoever is required. Just see it as a continuation of Scar's Samsara.
