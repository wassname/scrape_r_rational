  The chapter in which Cat finally realizes that her panicked jumping from one crisis to another looks a lot like an eldritch horror snowballing into a reckoning for everyone on the continent who ever hurt Callow or didn't stop those who did.

    yea, Cathrine is running with the bucket putting out fires and people afraid of getting wet since she's slowly making a bucket brigade.

      Lot of wicked witches of the west on calernia.

  I loved this chapter and this style of writing (which isn't surprising given the subreddit). Its rare to see a character explicitly modelling another characters thought process and rarer still to see it done well (both the modelling and the writing of it). Its strange that it is so, I feel like it implicitly undergirds a good majority of human interaction.

  This kind of chapter is what makes me have real respect for EE as an author. Instantly recontectualises the last few books, in a way that seems totally obvious in retrospect

    Honestly, it's kind of amazing EE's facility with story tropes and how he seemlessly integrates them in a good story, balancing plotting, action and character development, at the same time.
