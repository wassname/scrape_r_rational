## [D] Friday Open Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could (possibly) be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.

  Well, I almost made it. About a month until my projected vaccination time and I catch COVID. No respiratory issues (yet) but frequent chills, 24/7 headache, and fatigue. I'm in a very low risk demographic, but am disappointed in myself and fearful of long term effects. 

  I was in some extreme circumstances, but still could've done better. Don't let other's lax attitudes and disregard for safety lull you into complacency about your own precautions. Hopefully they turn out to be nothing, but I didn't think much about long term risks before I caught it.

  Now to do my best not to get anyone else sick.

    Sorry to hear of your illness. Glad you're taking measures to keep others safe. I heard that monoclonal antibody infusions are now becoming available to the public- at least in the Minneapolis area. It looks like treatment is limited to people with health issues like diabetes for now. Checking your state's COVID resources for similar programs is worth your time. These infusions help up to 10 days following infection.

          I'm puzzled as to where you are drawing that conclusion from. To my knowledge there have been multiple scientific studies of Covid-19 patients dating back to early 2020, and more recently, all showing lingering lung damage. For example:

          * [A June 2020 study indicating lung damage in survivors](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/06/study-finds-lung-impairment-recovering-covid-19-patients)
          * [A July 2020 postmortem study indicating lung damage](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7588618/)
          * [A September 2020 study of survivors indicating lingering lung damage for as long as 12 weeks in some patients, with some patients recovering faster than others](https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/937263#vp_1)
          * [A November 2020 postmortem study indicating lung damage](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/11/postmortem-lungs-covid-19-patients-show-massive-damage)

              Short summary of studies from September last year. I haven't stayed on top of this, but like, it's a current pandemic, people are focused on the immediate consequences right now, and there's plenty of political fuckery across the world in allocating relevant resources. I agree that we need better evidence before stating anything conclusively, but you are coming across way too cavalier about the potential here
              ```

              - u/sohois:
                ```
                It's a pandemic which has been going on for more than a year, with hundreds and hundreds of medical studies done in that time - including the various ones linked in that youtube summary. Determining if long term sequelae are likely would surely be a very important discovery.

                Nonetheless, there remains no good evidence - the studies in that youtube are no better, with a self report survey and two more no control studies which tell us nothing more than post viral symptoms exist in some people. I don't want to tell people how they should respond to risk, but at some point it's worth thinking like a Bayesian and realizing that the serious absence of evidence must push you towards evidence of absence. Even the surveys, which are about the only things we have to indicate if long term effects are an issue, have only found 2% of people continue to report symptoms (extremely vague symptoms like fatigue) after 3 months.

              There are different [standards of evidence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3124652/) (see also: [link](https://www.aafp.org/afp/2004/0201/p548.html)) followed within different fields of medicine, and in regards to what type of question is under examination.

              For proposed treatments, the standard of evidence is much higher, in which case you would  be right that we shouldn't rely on evidence from any study that wasn't rigorously designed with appropriate controls.

              However, the standard of evidence for prognosis (i.e. a forecast of the likely course of a disease or ailment without intervention) is much lower. The question of Covid-19 sometimes causing lingering lung damage *is* a prognosis. For prognosis, a case series is typically taken as acceptable evidence *if* the results are consistent across multiple studies *and* until better evidence is available. All four of the links I provided are case series of varying quality, and all agree on the presence of lingering lung damage in some percentage of patients who were hospitalized with Covid-19.

              Obviously, this does not tell us a prevalence, as you mentioned, but it does tell us that lingering lung damage is an observed outcome for some hospitalized Covid-19 patients. It would be *prudent* to take that possibility into account during recovery rather than make specious claims of 'no evidence'.
              ```

              - u/sohois:
                ```
                Given that those hospitalized with Covid are highly likely to be either very old or suffering from pre-existing conditions, no, people that were hospitalized with the disease having lung damage does not really tell us anything. That's the whole point of having control groups, so you can rule out the lung damage being from something else. Sure, we can say that is is some Bayesian evidence, but it shouldn't really push much against the much larger evidence against

                  Which is...?

                  Do you have study results that contradict the findings of the numerous case series linked in this thread?

                  Thus far, all of the studies I've seen meet a high standard of consistency in their results, so I'm still confused as to why you are claiming lack of evidence.

  Until poking around lit subreddits recently, I didn't realize how popular audiobooks have become. People use the word 'read' and 'listen' interchangeably, which is weird to me.

  It's made me wonder why there aren't more things like old radio dramas. Pod dramas? I'd think more writers would adapt to the medium and produce things more script like.

    There's a whole category of fictional podcasts, I think "Welcome to Nightvale" is an archetypal one. I haven't listened to any of them, but I assume some fall under that kind of content?

    Alternatively, there are the DND podcasts, which are more script-like than normal? (more like unscripted-like am i rite?)

    There is a huge wealth of old radio dramas in public broadcast corporation archives but its buried deep in analog archives and the relevant entities don't have enough money for proper digitalization+archivial. 

    In germany the public broadcast radio archives can be internet accessed back only 11(!) years, but often they'll play older stuff which we plebs don't have access to.

  for those of you following me, my jurisdiction hasn't had covid "in the wild" for 9.5 months until today when we had a case in a security guard for one of the quarantine locations. we are now 2 hours from a 5 day hard lockdown. 

  imagine a city of 2 million people who have been acting as if covid doesn't exist since august.

  imagine them having 6 hours to buy toilet paper in.

  Yeah.

      Easy peasy so far. We're in Day 2 and we've had two days of 0 results. I'm hoping that this case was in the 80% of covid carriers who I've heard DON'T transmit the virus?

      I got tested yesterday morning, at was apparently the most busy testing centre (I was there about two hours, but got there before it opened and was near the front of the queue). The line of cars for it was like several kms long. 

      I got my results back 7 hours later (I've been sick a week now so I was in the "symptomatic" group for test processing priority). My husband was tested from the same car and his results were 18 hours after the test. 

      The New York Times actually wrote an article about our city: https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/01/world/australia/perth-lockdown.html

      People in other parts of the world are acting like we're overreacting: I shared a screenshot of the /r/coronavirus subreddit comments with (American?) saying how ridiculous we are being. Personally the average western australian knows we've been lucky to spend 7 months living the post-covid life with no restrictions *and* no cases/deaths. If we do a 5 or 14 or 30 day hard lockdown to give us another 7 months of freedom then I'm happy to pay this price. (Note: Australia is slated to be vaccinated by December due to global shortages and our local vaccine candidate somehow causing false positive HIV tests)

        Sounds relatively luxurious, for sure.  I'm living in a jurisdiction that has had more covid cases in January than we had in all of 2020... because people JUST HAD to party for Christmas / New Year's, I guess.

        Meanwhile, I have one person on my Facebook feed, who lives in the same jurisdiction as me, posting stuff like:  "What is worse?  The fact that they have these nonsense rules or the fact that we let them?"  And I'm just sitting at my computer, like:  -_-

          god my ex boyfriend's family in France had a Christmas party. Something like 10 people, 4 were covid positive, the doctors said it was ok because they really wanted to celebrate christmas after such a hard year. I was like WHAT. 

          We had another 0 yesterday, today's results in about 5 hours (edit: another 0). Apparently the contact tracers are going to get all close contacts to isolate for 14 days and then we will go out of lockdown but with some level of restriction. 

          I have ordered more masks as we have two cloth masks and like 10 disposables in the house.

            I... would not make many future appointments with those doctors =/

            I envy that level of efficiency.  My jurisdiction is still fairly locked down, and had another 14 (confirmed) new cases today.  But also declined in active cases by 3, so, progress?

            Nice.  I have packages of disposable masks in the house and car, but I've been getting by pretty well with just my cloth mask.

  So I've been reading [The Last Angel](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-last-angel.244209/) that was mentioned here recently.  And I have some comments on cultural references in SF.  Overall, I enjoyed the story, but I have some nits to pick with regard to cultural references, that I think are worth discussing with other readers and writers of the genre.

  The story revolves around The Compact (think The Covenant from the Halo series of video games) which has existed thousands of years before encountering humanity. We have a galaxy full of bipedal alien races (c.f. the Star Trek problem), but let's not worry about that for now.

  There are several instances of cultural references in the text of The Last Angel that I found a little bit jarring, and which I'd like to see being avoided in future works by everyone.

  **General Cultural References**

  At one point, this squad of shock troopers (alien race called Tribunes) is having communication problems (actually due to subtle and active jamming by their adversary), and compares his state-of-the-art military comm gear to "a dime-store radio".

  So in 2021, "dime store" (or the even older "five and dime store") is already a dated reference for USA citizens.  And it makes no sense whatsoever for an alien species (that has existed for thousands of years before humanity had dime stores), to refer to them in a time thousands of years *after* any dime stores have existed at all.

  So in this case, I'd replace "dime-store radio" with "children's toy radio" because that is much more likely to exist across multiple cultures.  I encourage you all to think about this sort of thing in your own writing.

  **Units of Measure**

  At another point in the story, another Tribune refers to an incident in his youth where he and his sister were running from danger as the ship they were on was being attacked.  He says (thinks) about how he was "a few meters" ahead of his sister when they were separated by a closing pressure door, and she was sucked into space.

  I've read more than a few SF novels where the aliens had their own units of measure, and that was always a bit clunky.  And of course there is the conceit that these aliens don't actually think / talk in English, and that we're reading some kind of translation of the original anyway.

  But even beyond that, I'd like to see SF authors avoid references to our culture's units of measurement when possible.  If the phrase had been "a few strides ahead" instead, that is much more cross-cultural and less (to me) intrusive to the flow.  And what is a meter, or a yard anyway?  It is about one stride, so it would be common for many cultures (of bipedal aliens) across time and space to have a similar unit of measurement.

  Again, this is not a call for SF authors to invent their own units of measurement for every alien species.  That is more annoying that useful in my opinion. Maybe just write something like "the ship came out of warp about 10,000 [kilometers] off the bow" to indicate the units have been translated.  I don't know if people would find that more annoying or not.

  The unit "years" is actually OK in my view.  For any culture that evolves on a planet orbiting in the green zone of a G-type star, the orbital period is likely to be approximately a Earth-standard year.  And in fact, The Last Angel does mention a Compact-Standard Year occasionally.  It isn't going to be exactly an Earth year, but that's OK for storytelling purposes.

    The measurement units don't really bother me, it's implied.

    &#x200B;

    Unless you preface the story with a 'this story takes place in a different world, with different languages, cultures and systems of measurement. When you see a unit of measurement or expression that seems out of place assume it has been adapted for the optimal interpretation for most readers.' some nitpicky people will complain. 

    &#x200B;

    I know people in for instance MoL don't speak english, don't use the measurement units we do, have different grammar, conjugation, alphabet and pronunciation for sounds. Some things are implied, they don't always need to be stated. 

    &#x200B;

    Imho this type of nitpicking are the ones that tend to make many people not like nitpickers. Nitpick meaningful things, the plot, worldbuilding, prose. Not things that are inherently implied in any story that's not set IRL with characters that speak english and use your preferred measurement system.
    ```

    - u/ansible:
      ```
      > Imho this type of nitpicking are the ones that tend to make many people not like nitpickers.

      Oh, I get it.  For whatever reason, I don't notice the measurement units thing when describing a scene.  I did notice it this time because it was a personal recollection by a non-human character, that wasn't even voiced.
      ```

      - u/fassina2:
        ```
        Apparently you still don't.. It's implied, regardless of story, narrator or character origin, in **any** story that isn't set irl.

        Just like people don't complain about reading stories about aliens appearing to speak english to each other, because it's implied they're not speaking english. When an alien in a story uses a measurement unit it's also implied that he's not using meters or liters, but his own analogue. 

        Human measurement units in these cases can be seen as a normal translations. Stories humans make are, in general, made for humans and so it's inherently written with human measurements and languages.
        ```

    > The unit "years" is actually OK in my view. For any culture that evolves on a planet orbiting in the green zone of a G-type star, the orbital period is likely to be approximately a Earth-standard year.

    But there are lots of reasons aliens might not use years. If the atmosphere didn't give a good view of the heavens. If the planet had no axial tilt or a 90 degree tilt. If food growing or biological cycles weren't tied to seasons.

    A meter is an abstract unit, but a year is tied to the reality of life on 
    that planet.
    ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Even more so than Earth units, I've put a lot of thought into the usage of words that are etymologically derived from places. Things like "phonetic" (from Phoenicia) or "geosynchronous" (which specifically refers to the Earth, as opposed to something like areosynchronous for Mars), where people realistically shouldn't be using it. Neither is a fantastic example, since phonetic is pretty acceptable and geosynchronous being used for other planets isn't a mistake most scifi authors make, but it elucidates the point adequately.

    I wondered for a while if this was *actually* a problem, or just something I worry about for no reason, but then I read Brent Weeks' Lightbringer series and realized it actually is - that series uses so many Earth concepts that it's incredibly distracting. So now it's something I consider when writing, and something I tend to nitpick/notice when reading.

  I've heard a bit about Tony Robbins, a self-help author, and he seems a lot more reasonable than I was expecting from the stereotype. Does anyone else know about him? I'm curious what others think.
  ```

  - u/fassina2:
    ```
    Pirate some of his programs and see what you think of them. If they are helpful or not etc. 

    &#x200B;

    I don't get the self help stigma, I'm not too proud to take advice and / or be angry at people that give it, but many people are. 

    &#x200B;

     I guess lets compete and find out in the long run who has the better outcomes.
    ```
