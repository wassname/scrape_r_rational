  The story is coming along nicely so far.

  Two suggestions:

  First, cut back on using proper names; intersperse them with descriptors.  For instance, "Shanna" could be "the geomancer," or "the blindfolded woman," or "the terse woman," or "the woman in the suit," or... the list could go on and on.  It makes the story feel less repetitive, and, at the same time, reminds us who these other characters are.  Remember that it's been several days since we've read your story; it's not a bad idea to subtly re-establish who everyone is in the reader's mind at the start of each chapter.  I was picturing Faulkner as an old, frail wizard type until I went back a chapter and found out he was young and muscular.

  The second note is much the same as the first: sometimes the progression of events could be made clearer, if you'd tie what's currently happening back to previous occurrences a bit more.  I think just using descriptors will help a lot with that, but also don't be afraid, even this early, to draw parallels between what is happening now and what happened one or two chapters ago.  For instance, Seti recognizes Elder Narn from the previous chapter; in that chapter, the Elder doesn't seem happy that the MC is staying.  So, when the grump throws a nasty glance at the new pupil, Seti can remember the disdain from the previous chapter and speculate on why that is.  And by doing so, you're both reminding the reader of what they may have forgotten (who Elder Narn is and what happened last chapter), as well as providing a sense of continuity with earlier events.

  Other than those small notes, you seem to be doing a good job telling your story thus far.  Keep it up!

  Didn't see that twist coming. Interesting world you're crafting, I look forward to future chapters.

  Great chapter. Just got into it and ate it all up in big gulps. Good shit.

  Interesting to see Seti embracing the coercive side of his niche so readily. Also, the Shepherds seem worryingly powerful. Sure, maybe there was an actual, independent, publicly accountable oversight and authorization process that enabled them to take Seti into custody, but it sure doesn't seem that way.

    >maybe there was an actual, independent, publicly accountable oversight and authorization process that enabled them to take Seti into custody, but it sure doesn't seem that way.

    Why wouldn't it seem that way? Could you go further into why you think the Shepherds are worryingly powerful? In real life, most people do not know the checks and balances of police officers. They only know that usually they need a warrant to search private areas, but otherwise can make an arrest or detain people with the badge. And in real life, lawyers are presented only after the arrest to ensure the rights are known.

    In the same vein, a Shepherd is a known entity. We know that there is a law regarding geases (the AVC Act, mentioned during the "arrest"), so the Shepherd's rights could be attached to that. 

    As for checks and balances, I haven't done any world building (and ultimately, the government) towards that end except to mention that there are Guilds that are different from the Shepherds.

      > Why wouldn't it seem that way?

      Realistically, for the same reason that many people don't actually buy those same systems of supposed checks and balances in real life police forces.

      Giving groups of people power over others requires real, difficult, work to prevent it from degenerating into self-serving corruption and power plays and the like.

      (This may not be the argument the other poster was making.)

      As for worryingly powerful, in general the police in our world (at least in the US) have to at least make up some sort of crime that you personally have committed in order to essentially "force you to go with them" against your will. It seems probable that "suspicion of being under a geas" would likely be this world's equivalent of "I thought they had a gun and/or drugs", except if only drug dealers could determine that you had possession of drugs, or arms dealers were the only ones who could determine that you had a gun.

      This is of course assuming that only a vivimancer could determine whether or not another vivimancer placed a geas on someone, along with potentially not being able to determine whether or not any given vivimancer is able to place geases (?).

      From the events shown thus far, that doesn't seem like an unreasonable conclusion to make, even if the world as it exists is wildly different from this. At a minimum, it seems like the correct perspective for our MC to have, given the events in his life as we've seen them.

  Well that last line was unexpected. Definitely interested in reading more.

  One thing that I'm curious about now - was a mafia leader actually on what sounded like a semi-popular reality show? Or was he making that up?

    Haha, okay I'll talk about this here because I don't think I'll bring it up again (or if I do, it'll be more of a passing thought).

    Let me quote chapter 3 and give my thoughts why I wrote something a certain way:
    >"Bah, he has no stress. Regardless," Elder Poe started, taking a glance at Seti, "there is a risk to bringing theâ€¦ uninitiated into the temple."

    Here Elder Poe is worried about bringing the "uninitiated" into the temple (this was his way of worrying that their identity could come into light)

    >[Faulkner] grinned through the cigarette in his mouth. "Do you know who I am?"

    >Seti shook his head. He had difficulty identifying people he already knew as it was, so a stranger he may have seen in the past was definitely out of the question. Sydria also shook her head.

    >"I am Faulkner. Does that ring any bells?" The young master was expectant. Though called the young master, he wasn't young in the way that Seti thought; in fact, he was probably the blindfold woman's age.

    >Again the two siblings shook their head. **The elders exchanged glances.**

    >"Ah, I'll pretend I'm not disappointed. Our temple may or may not have been on a reality TV show a few years back, but I suppose all fame dies out eventually. Now then, with whom am I speaking?"

    This part specifically, from my view, was them checking to see if Faulkner was recognized by them. He played it off when he realized that they didn't, but if they had then who knows what would've happened o.o

    So no, I don't think he was actually on a reality show lol
    ```

      Yeah, it was the last part specifically that I was thinking about. 

      For sheer entertainment value, I almost want to headcannon that the "reality TV show" he mentioned was the news, though I could just as easily see the mafia preventing something like that from happening.
      ```

        LOL that's great
