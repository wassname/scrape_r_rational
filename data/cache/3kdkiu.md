## [FF][RST] Fling a Light (Worm)

### Post:

[This ongoing fic](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/fling-a-light-worm.21488) features an alt-powered Taylor (in a somewhat AU Worm) trying to be a good consequentialist and applying her powers effectively to the betterment of mankind. I'm loving it since it's a rare rationalist fic with a focus on effective altruism. As a plus, Taylor is actually pretty believable as a beginner rationalist. She reads not like a genius munchkin with a doctorate in cognitive science, but as a teenager who decided to get off her ass and apply her comparative advantage to making human lives better efficiently.

EDIT: The author declared that he's going to rewrite this fic. The link  goes to the old (now dead) version.

  I've always wanted to see more Accord in the original. In this fic he seems a lot less easy to offend.

    Agreed. 

    I've always felt like leveraging superpowers on a massive scale is something interesting to explore and this fic seems to be going in that direction. People with abilities of Coil, Tattletale, Dinah and Accord really should be engaging in world optimisation instead of petty squabbling over a shithole of a city.
