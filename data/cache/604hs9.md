## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  So, I've seen *[Future Diary](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FutureDiary)* recently. It was entertaining, the characters sometimes were clever, interesting, and/or awesome, but the most fascinating thing, of course, wasn't used to its full potential. ^((You may notice) ^[a](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4y62uz/d_wednesday_worldbuilding_thread/d6l7r8m/?context=3) ^[pattern](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4y62uz/d_wednesday_worldbuilding_thread/d6l7r8m/?context=3) ^here.)

  After thinking about it, I can imagine why, and almost forgive that. Almost.

  To be brief, twelve people were given magical devices ('Diaries') that can predict the future, each in an individual specific way. They were then put in a city and told to kill each other; the last one standing gets to be a god.

  The time travel system has rules, which can be viewed as example [here](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FutureDiary), but typically, they weren't defined clearly enough. My take on that is similar to [my take](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4y62uz/d_wednesday_worldbuilding_thread/d6l7r8m/?context=3) on the Caller's time travel system: any given prediction of a Diary tells the future of a timeline where the Diaries stopped working the instant before that prediction was made. As a consequence, they can't predict the other Diaries, and they can't predict themselves. You can think about it this way: each time a prediction is about to be made, the timeline splits into a 'disposable' one, where the Diaries don't work, and a 'primary' one, which gets messages from the disposable one's future.

  So, I'm now trying to figure out how a confrontation between two rational and competent Diary Holders would go, and...

  ___

  Let's take something simple. The Priestess has a Clairvoyance Diary, which tells her what her flock — each member of her flock — will perceive in the future. The Terrorist has an Escape Diary, which gives her a workable escape path that one of her selves discovered in a 'disposable' timeline. The Terrorist is in the Priestess's shrine, and needs to escape.

   1. The Terrorist gets an escape path.

   2. The Priestess gets information that the Terrorist would escape and where she would escape, and so gives orders to concentrate forces in that location.

   3. The Terrorist gets an updated escape path, which takes into account the Priestess's adjustments.

   N. Repeat ad infinitum.

  A competent Priestess may foresee that, and order her people to let the Terrorist escape, *unless* you see her changing her behaviour after looking at her Diary. A Diary can't predict a Diary; a Diary cannot predict *itself*: so a Diary can't take into account the consequences of its future actions on its plans in the present.

  So the Terrorist gets caught.

  *But.* A competent Terrorist may compare what her Diary is telling her to what she sees, and precommit to, if she *doesn't* notice changes in the flock's behaviour, fluke her escape attempt, follow the previous path and get caught, *only* acting on her new escape path if she sees the Priestess' people acting to circumvent the previous one. The Priestess sees her countermeasures working, assumes that the Terrorist won't get an update before it's too late. The Terrorist, meanwhile, will escape.

  *But.* Both a competent Terrorist and a competent Priestess, who know of the weakness described above — i.e., precommiting to do X if you see the evidence that you're in a 'disposable' timeline, enact the actual plan in the primary timeline only — may teach themselves (or their people) to act as if they receive messages from the future, even if they *don't*, in order to get a picture of the enemy's true plans in the present. Or vice-versa, pretend to lose the predicative power to bait out the opponent's precommited defeats.

  Or be classy and act as consistently or as unpredictable as possible, so that nobody could tell if you have precog or not, from the look of your actions.

  Or do something I did not think of.

  ___

  The above is an example of a confrontation between two players, in a closed location and within a short timeframe, with fairly comprehensible Diary interactions, using the first trick I came up with. Can you imagine twelve people with completely different predicative abilities waging a war in a city, in the span of a few months? I feel confused just imagining thinking about it.

  So, naturally thought I, why not add *more* complexity?

  You can read canon Diaries' abilities [here](http://futurediary.wikia.com/wiki/Future_Diary_%28term%29#List_of_Diaries), I can try translating them to my system on demand. Can you think of any interesting exploits? Counters to the tactics described above? More cool munchkinery?

  ^(Or ideas on how to make sense of the complicated interactions?)
  ```

  - u/mg115ca:
    ```
    After reading the Tvtropes entry and the list of what all the diaries do, my first question is this: Can the diaries be stolen? Not to use for yourself but based on the idea that destroying a diary will kill it's user. Society has a lot of rules and restrictions on killing people. However, you could (in theory) manage to get a single kill off while avoiding the diary warning the person, but then you now have the police hunting you down adding difficulty to your goal. Society reacts much less harmfully to things like stealing or destroying cell phones. Stealing someone's diary and hiding it for 24 hours will A) prevent them from receiving updates from the future and B) with the 24 hour waiting period, keeps them from getting a DEAD END notification before you steal the diary. The most they might get is an odd lack of entries before the theft (which in turn makes the theft easier) since future!they don't have the diary to write in it (unless the diary entries still appear as though they had the diary to write in it, which is difficult but not insurmountable). Then after the 24 hour (possibly 48 hour for some to be safe) waiting period, you drop the phone in a blender, the diary user dies with no connection to you other than some sleight of hand or snatching the phone out of their hand 12 hours earlier.

    The main weakness' of this strategy are both The Criminal Investigation Diary (with it's 90 day reach and focus on crimes in general (such as theft)) and any "paired" diaries where one can monitor the other (such as The Exchange Diaries and Yukiteru & Yuno's diaries).

    This also makes me wonder how much information the players have about each other. Knowing exactly how everyone's diary works will up the survivablity dramatically, and being able to model people's behavior (if player 3 gets information X in their diary, they will decide to do Y, and therefore I should tell past me to do Z, which will prompt player 5 to convince player 8 to do Q...) will ramp up the complexity.
    ```

    - u/Noumero:
      ```
      (There shouldn't be any problems with the police: the bodies of the Diary Holders rather conveniently get sucked into black hole thingies upon dying, which leaves no evidence at all!)

      > Can the diaries be stolen?

      Yes. As a matter of fact, nothing stops you from just taking someone's Diary and... using it for yourself. The messages continue to arrive (they're completely simulated, no actual typing is involved in any timeline), the Holder doesn't need to be able to read them or be in close proximity to the Diary. The First's Diary will continue to tell about the events the First perceives, it won't 'change owners', strictly speaking, but it won't care who reads its messages for what purposes, either.

      The Diary-robbery was even done once in the anime, though naturally nobody bothered to do the obvious thing and start stealing others' Diaries for their powers.

      (Granted, there are drawbacks to this approach. As destroying a Diary kills the Holder, killing a Holder destroys the Diary. To be safe, you can't just steal someone's Diary and trust them not to get killed at the most inapporiate for you moment, or not to form a temporary alliance with the other Holders and reveal your new Diary's weaknesses to them.)

      >This also makes me wonder how much information the players have about each other

      It depends, but in general, barring the Eleventh and his hax not-actually-Future-Diary Diary, nobody knew anything about anyone else or their Diaries besides seeing their silhouettes when the gamemaster introduced them to the game.
      ```

    The terrorist knows when he's in a simulated timeline by checking whether his diary works, and thus can't be tricked by the flock's actions into thinking that he's in the true timeline.
    ```

    - u/Noumero:
      ```
      The Terrorist doesn't get a constant stream of '1' if she is in the primary timeline, she gets an updated plan *only* if her current one is unworkable. That means she can't distinguish the primary timeline where her current plan works from the disposable one where her Diary doesn't.

      **Edit:** Albeit she can precommit to go surrender if her Diary doesn't change, to check if it works, which... I don't think will work. While not-altering of the Diary's text would result in her failure to escape, the Diary's altering of its text for the sole purpose of *convincing* the Terrorist to escape would imply its attempts to *manipulate* her into escaping, which I don't think it's supposed to do.
      ```

      - u/Gurkenglas:
        ```
        What happens if there is no plausible possibility of escape? Cause that's what would happen if the Diary searched a timeline where the diary doesn't work and the terrorist reliably commited to surrender if the diary doesn't work.

        Edit: After reading the other thread, the workings of the diary are more clear: Each time he queries the Diary, he goes into a Groundhog Day loop with mostly amnesia that he can only break out of by escaping, during which none of the other diaries work - an [outcome pump](http://lesswrong.com/lw/ld/the_hidden_complexity_of_wishes/), if you will, that will eventually summon great improbabilities if escape is not plausibly possible. Does the Diary read the Terrorist's mind to find the best escape suggestions he could give back if he wanted to, or can the Terrorist choose what information to send back? (What's the exact reset trigger? I suppose that the Priestess cannot try to brainwash him without triggering a reset.)

        Since computers exist, and surely somewhere in the world there's some idiot that's generating random numbers and running them as code, after an exponential amount of loops an AGI spawns and tries to break out of whatever Diary it's currently trapped in. Therefore Diary users might want to limit the amount of loops they run. For example, the terrorist might carry dice, and after he activates the Diary throw the dice to see if he rolls 100 1s in a row to see whether the loops have been going on too long, and then desperately try to convince, say, the Priestess, to let him "escape" to break the loop before it eats them.
        ```

  - u/Slapdash17:
    ```
    In the scenario described after your first *but*, is the diary only telling the terrorist that information based on the terrorist's conditional commitment? It sounds like the diary is responding to mental commitments of the user, so how complex can the commitment go? If conditionals are fair game, it sounds like you can set up a series of If/Then statements, some even nested within each other, that could eventually involve elementary computer programming. Or am I misunderstanding?

    And the diary can predict what people can do, but not if what they will do will end up being informed or determined what another diary will do? If so, I would say one of the more obvious things to do would be to introduce people into the equation that don't have diaries, so as to have more reliable and predictable elements that can be exploited. Try hiring/threatening/blackmailing people without diaries into helping you, since it sounds like that's the only real way to have controllable elements in this competition. 

    ETA: Even though the competition can have only one winner, I think at the beginning some diary users would form a temporary alliance, which could potentially limit the amount of chaos in the narrative at the beginning of the story up until some players are eliminated.

    This actually reminds me of a power I came up with in a [previous munchkinry thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/56heia/saturday_munchkinry_thread/d8jv2rj/)

    Do you think my power could be refashioned as a future diary? It would probably have to be something extremely simple, like a tiny box with two red LEDs, but I digress.

    What do you think? It seems like you've given these kinds of superpowers a lot of thought, so I'd like your input on my future diary's uses and usefulness.

    Thanks!
    ```

    - u/Noumero:
      ```
      Well, given the real implications of this power...

      Suppose I have a button that adds to the world 500 utilons with 50% probability, and -500 utilons with 50% probability. I look at your device, see *let's say* '1', then press the button. If it adds utilons, I send '1', then press it again. If it doesn't, I send '0', killing the timeline. Repeat ad nauseam. The only timeline that survives is the one where the button always added utility.

      Now that I wrote it, it's pretty clearly a generalized version of your example with answering an Evil Overlord's questions.

      Looking at it from another angle... Going full Utility Monster?

      Let's suppose our world has value X. I can increase it by an amount Y, if only I had a Novikov-Consistent time-travel device. I use your device, get '1', try doing my thing.

      If I fail, I send '0' and terminate the timeline, thereby killing everyone in it and doing an X amount of evil.

      If I win, I send '1'; the value of our world is now X+Y. To right my wrongs, I precommit to always 'send back' the bits I 'receive', then use your device to copy this timeline [div(X/Y)+1] times, which 'outweights' me killing an X value timeline.

      What a good person I am.

      **Edit:** Wait, actually, no, a correction. If X>0, you should just start copying the timeline indefinitely, not bothering with the utility-increasing, and if X<0, you should continue 'adding Y', i.e. treating the device as a time machine and increasing the utility, until X>0, then start copying.

      ___

      ^(Note: this conjecture does not reflect my actual views on morality. In the event of finding yourself in a similar situation, do not follow the strategy described above before discussing it with at least three qualified philosophers.)

      ___

      It could be used as a tool of blackmail, too. 'I will erase this timeline unless you do X'. Would only work on the ones who don't get No-Blackmail Equilibrium, of course.

      > Do you think my power could be refashioned as a future diary?

      No, I don't see a way to propely transfer your device onto my rules.

      Let's assume you activate it. It simulates a future where it feeds you '1', up to a point where you attempt to 'send back' a bit: if you choose '1', it feeds you '1' in reality; if you choose '0', it terminates the simulation and tries again with '0'. If you-from-the-simulation sends '0' back, it shows '0'; if your simulation sends '1', it... Does what? Neither feeding you '0' nor feeding you '1' creates an appearance of a stable time loop, so it glitches. It can't kill you, after all, and my Diaries don't simulate Diaries (i.e., no recursive simulations), which doesn't allow for branching timelines.

      On using it, you could precommit to send '1', '0', or 'the opposite of what I received' making it either feed you the corresponding bit, or glitch, which could be used as a... remote control, or some sort of messenger. Similar to LiteralHeadCannon's example with printing the bit.

      And you obviously could precommit to send '1' if X, '0' if Y, and send 'the opposite of what you received' if Z, and getting messages from the future.
      ```

  - u/MugaSofer:
    ```
    To be honest, this is fiddly enough that I'm dubious it could make a good story.

    Anyway:

    > Timeline 1: Priestess' flock inexplicably do nothing. Terrorist buys this (?) and escapes. RESET
    > 
    > Timeline 2: Priestess' diary warns her that Terrorist is in the building she orders her flock to capture them. Terrorist is captured. RESET.
    > 
    > Timeline 3: Priestess' diary describes her flock capturing the Terrorist. However, the Terrorist's diary gives her directions to avoid the flock, which she does. Terrorist escapes successfully. RESET
    > 
    > Timeline 4: Priestess' diary says her flock don't see anything. Terrorist escapes successfully. REAL TIMELINE

    Thus, the actual sequence of events is:

    1. Terrorist consults diary (generating a throwaway timeline), begins path
    2. The moment Terrorist consults her diary, Priestess' diary notices the future is different (how?) and generates a new throwaway timeline. Priestess' diary updates to reflect the new path.
    3. Priestess reads her diary. Terrorist's diary notices time has shifted and generates a new throwaway timeline.
    4. Priestess orders her flock to attack! But they fail.

    Or am I misunderstanding the system here?
    ```

  - u/MugaSofer:
    ```
    Reading through the list:

    * Use the Murder Diary to brute-force searches for specific individuals and/or locations. Conveniently, your whole goal in this exercise is to find some people and kill them. Otherwise useless.
    * The Clairvoyant Diary (the same one you called the Priestess, above) is basically an upgraded version of the generic diaries. "But what if they get fooled!" is not actually a weakness, since literally anyone can be fooled.
    * The Escape/Terrorist diary is by far the most powerful diary in combat, given a broad definition of "combat".
    * The Watcher and the Blog need to recruit minions. Watcher is a moron for working alone. Blog should just get someone to stand in her presence at all times, preferably multiple people, or just give a Blog to someone who has a crush on her.

    All the other diaries are variations on the same basic "it tells the future!" thing. They're all *really useful* for brute-forcing tasks that don't involve other diaries.

    Generic diary tricks:

    * Diaries can be used "offensively", since they can't be predicted. I.e. if you want to catch someone, you need to check your diary *immediately after they do* and then strike.
    * Attend a meeting with another diary-holder, then check the results and don't actually do it. Only works if they're an ally. Or I guess you could buy a phone, or, like, literally use your diary (most of which are phones) as a phone. Still, I remain convinced there's a use for this trick.
    * The correct way to win the tournament is probably to brute-force your way to nuclear weapons, wait 24 hours, and then destroy whatever city this anime is set in.

    EDIT: more generally, I think the thing to do is probably to brute-force mundane tasks that add up to a situation where you can't lose. After a week, diary-holders should rule most of the globe and the manhunt for the others should be ongoing. The mundane utility of these diaries (except the Terrorist) is just *so much greater* than the diary-vs-diary utility of any of them.
    ```

      Great ideas.

      >Attend a meeting with another diary-holder, then check the results and don't actually do it. Only works if they're an ally. Or I guess you could buy a phone, or, like, literally use your diary (most of which are phones) as a phone. Still, I remain convinced there's a use for this trick.

      Yes. Variations on this are: 

      * Outsource your thinking to your DT (disposable timeline) selves, get plans that should take you a day in a second. Works with multi-people discussions, and iterative plans, and iterative discussions, too.

      * Use DTs to convince people of something, then read and use the best arguments your DT selves have found.

      * Use DTs to torture people for information, get only the results.

      * Use DTs to steal information from well-defended facilities in suicide raids.

      * Start mass-scale terrorist bombings in a DT timeline, promise to stop if the 'former' Diary Holders reveal themselves, get their identities. (Should work great at the start, when almost no-one knows how the Diaries work, how it looks 'from the inside'.)

      And so on. Basically, as long as no other Diary is involved, almost any Diary Holder is virtually omniscient and has quantitative superintelligence. (Conditional on them finding a way to send themselves arbitrary messages, but it should be doable for most of them, if... unwiedly, for some.)

      > The correct way to win the tournament is probably to brute-force your way to nuclear weapons, wait 24 hours, and then destroy whatever city this anime is set in.

      ... Yes. It *is*. That occurred to me too, when I was thinking of how I would try to win this mess.

      If you commit to only launch the missiles after witnessing your Diary predicting the future, none of the others Diary Holders would even see it coming until it's too late to leave the area of destruction. Hilarious.

      >After a week, diary-holders should rule most of the globe and the manhunt for the others should be ongoing. The mundane utility of these diaries (except the Terrorist) is just so much greater than the diary-vs-diary utility of any of them.

      I was imagining them getting stuck in a stalemate, constantly foiling each other's 'mundane' plans, forcing confrontations, perhaps one of them setting up a perimeter around the city, et cetera, but... You're probably right. They would immediately try to flee the city at all costs and start global-scale decades-spanning Scry vs. Scry World War Three. Which would be fun to witness, but impossible to plan. *Damnation.*

      The anime had a sort of justification: the god-gamemaster who set it all up was dying, needed to pick a successor soon unless the world ends, so it put everyone in one city. I suppose creating a time limit and closing off the city's borders would indeed be necessary to prevent global-scale messes and nuclear surprises.

  Every time you are training yourself in a physical or mental task, you have the option to financially invest in making your training time significantly more efficient- as in, there's a theoretical dollar amount that makes your time training yourself twice as efficient as not spending any money on your training time at all. 

  Clarifications:

  * The amount you spend is however much or little as you like, on a continuous scale. If $X increases your training effectiveness by 100%, spending $2X will increase it by 200% and $.5X will make it increase by 50%.
  * the mechanism of spending your money is essentially magical and absolute- no bargaining, no cheating or trickery, no refunds. 
  * the aspect of your training that is enhanced by your financial investment tends toward being more specific. For example, spending money on training your sprinting will make you faster, whereas training your jogging will make you have better endurance while running. Similarly, spending money on practicing math problems will make you better at the type of math you're practicing, not just generally smarter. Spending it while weightlifting will only make you stronger in the muscle group that you are currently working on 
  * Training in this fashion can ultimately make you superhumanly good at a human task (e.g. running superhumanly fast, being superhumanly strong), but it cannot give you a fundamentally superhuman skill like telekinesis or ATLA's earthbending.
  * I don't want to assign specific dollar values, but in each case money spent is significant enough that you want to be intentional about it, yet affordable enough that it can still be a presence in your life. It's not $100, it's not 50 cents.

  1) If this was true of you right now starting today, what would you do differently?

  2) If this was true of you from birth, what would you do differently?

  I know there are parts of this I left open/vague, so ask as many questions as you need. Also, this prompt is going to be making an appearance in the next Worldbuilding thread! For now, let's just keep this question limited to one theoretical person.

    Invest in one activity that being extremely good at will make you a lot of money. The best example I can think of is paying to get better at investing since that scales up pretty significantly. Initially you would make very little money, and you'll want to live extremely frugally putting as much money into training that as you can, however once you started making substantial profits from investing you would be able to improve exponentially (since you feed profit back into your profit making potential) as you developed a superhuman ability to predict the market and everyone wanted to give you their money to invest since you are the best around.

    Once you have a shit-ton of money you can start investing in other skills. Ideally you want to pick skills that require more than specific training in that skill to excel at. So for instance you would level up your performance at IQ tests or other such "skills" that can't be easily trained and are anchored to an underlying and widely useful ability.                            
    Anyway since the cost of improvement is set at a level that would be reasonable for a much lower level of wealth, you should quickly be able to quickly reach superhuman levels of intelligence once you really hit the exponential takeoff in your investing/improvement feedback loop.

    Also I should mention that given you can get to superhuman levels, this leads to a singularity pretty quick, given the relatively tiny range of normal human intelligence on an absolute scale.
    ```

    - u/Slapdash17:
      ```
      Making money should certainly be one's first goal, but I'm not sure what that would look like. I don't know what getting better at investing would look like, at least in our world. I can't think of any skill that would make one reliably better at stocks (perhaps quantitative analysis? But even that's not a sure thing).
      ```

      - u/vakusdrake:
        ```
        It doesn't really say it needs to be a specific skill, just that it needs to be a mental or physical task. So as long as you're investing you could improve investing as described. Obviously you would probably need to do some research on what kind of investing seems likely to work best with this plan, but the general plan stays the same, and I don't pretend to know enough to really get into the specific logistics.                                        
        Anyway I'm pretty confident this is the best plan, since no other skill/task can scale to this extent and provide exponential feedback in the same way.
        ```

        - u/Slapdash17:
          ```
          Ah, I was hoping my third bullet point would address that. For something complex like investing, you would need to break it down into its component parts, like quantitative analysis. Similarly, in your IQ test example, you could train yourself in the mental skills necessary to do well on an IQ test (pattern recognition and such) but that is the only guarantee. Instead of you being smart enough to get a better score, it would be you being good enough at the test to get a better score. I know that's splitting hairs, but it seems like an important distinction.
          ```

          - u/vakusdrake:
            ```
            >Instead of you being smart enough to get a better score, it would be you being good enough at the test to get a better score

            With the IQ example I deliberately chose that because it can't make you better at the test _except_ by making you better at the underlying abilities. As I said in my original answer the idea is to pick tasks that are broad such that there's no way to get better at the test but _not_ the underlying ability. Performance at the test needs to be inseparable from the ability it's supposed to measure.

            As for the investing example there's likely multiple ways to go about things, but since things are tied to that task, just figure out which types of investing you can benefit most from initially. Once you get past that initial exponential takeoff you're pretty much set.
            ```

  - u/ulyssessword:
    ```
    I'd only use money for magical training when I'm *also* using money for mundane training.  

    If $100 can buy you a coach/tutor that doubles your training gains, and $100 can buy you magic boosts that double your training gains, then you get a 4x boost for $200, instead of the $300 it would take with pure magic.  I'm guessing that real-life trainers scale in efficiency at less than a 1:1 rate (i.e. spending twice as much gets you less than twice the benefit), so I'd likely end up spending more on magic than on people if I was being efficient.

    ---

    Sports seems like a very easy target if you had it since birth.  Pro athletes get millions of dollars (which can fuel your training), and putting in 100 hour-equivalents of training per day is probably enough to get you there.  

    If I got it right now instead of at birth, I'd look into some sort of consulting job where the demand is for quickly learning a new skill or set of knowledge.  Examples are emergency tech support for legacy systems, jack-of-all-trades for rich/powerful people, or anything else time-sensitive, important, and rare.

    I think the final combinations of skills would be something that lets me determine, for any given skill, how much money that skill would let me make both long-term and short-term, how easier my ability would make learning it in comparasion to an ordinary human (in absolute terms, i.e. training-hours, not in relative terms, which are constant, by your first bullet point), are there any combinations of this skill with other skills that would make learning it a priority, et cetera — and then calculate the skill's usefulness using these values.

    Breaking that down into individual skills... I'm not sure. Building mathematical models, obviously. Analyzing basic economic interactions, then specialized ones (which I would only figure out after learnig the basics). Learning theory. I think looking-at-a-profession-and-breaking-it-into-individual-skills could be considered a skill, so I'll do that. Possibly also long-term planning.

    I think that strategy would work great in the second scenario, where I have it from birth, so I can take my time researching it. In the first scenario, I would probably need to combine it with u/vakusdrake's suggestion of using it to get better at acquiring money.

      I certainly agree with both you and /u/vakusdrake, but the difficulty with nailing it down to a skill or collection of skills is what's bugging me.

    What defines money? If I make this ability public and somehow demonstrate proof, I might be able to crowdfund money to me, especially given that I'm not spending the money, I'm destroying it - which overall has the effect of the gifters not gifting any amount of their actual societal resources to me, unlike normal dollar gifting. If you destroy a one dollar bill, that one dollar is now gone, and the value of all other dollars increases just slightly. 

    Alternatively, in the same vein, I can reach out to the government and get them to mint me a [trillion dollar coin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trillion_dollar_coin).

  You're a superhuman entity that has recently gained control of american politics during the early 1950's. In the last few years superhumans have begun to arise and it's become apparent that intelligence as well as rationality and education level (and to a lesser extent fitness and general health) are heavily connected with the rare people who get powers and large doses of hallucinogens often trigger their emergence (well that and facing certain death). Superpower strength is frequently high enough to make people one man armies that require large amounts of explosives to take down, so they are of incredible military value, given the scope of the powers and the number of superhumans their effects on other elements of society is not large enough to be of importance here.                      
  In the last year it's become apparent that both sides are going to use their superhumans to directly attack each other while claiming they were rogue parties for plausible deniability. As thus having more superhumans is of massive importance, and a military superhumans arms race is inevitable.

  So with that how do you try to get ahead in the superhuman arms race?                       
  Basically this is supposed to be a scenario where there's a military arms race to raise the sanity waterline, because more rationality as well as knowledge of your mind and reality work will make superpowers more likely. Plus there's a similar incentive to make the population more intelligent and to a lesser extent healthier generally, so something like leaded gasoline would be seen as a threat to national security due to it's effects on national, IQ. Oh yeah and I guess you'll want to try to massively increase the prevalence of hallucinogen use.               
  Still saying you need to do these things is one thing, but it's less clear how you would actually manage it.

    There's also an incentive to *lower* the sanity waterline of the population of your enemy, make them deluded and dim. Biological and chemical weapons, memetic hazards in the form of propaganda and pseudoscience, assasinations of the enemy's scientists/politicians — they would be powerful tools in this endeavor.

    Which is something most governments would be doing, I think. It is easier, it's something we have more experience with as a civilization, it is more benefitical in the short-term, than raising your population's rationality.

    Moloch will win shortly afterwards, the civilization cast into the new Dark Ages.

      It's assumed that the soviets have their own superintelligence acting on their behalf so things aren't going to be easy, assume if you could think of a countermeasure so could they. 

      Chemical, biological and other obvious weapons seem unlikely to be viable since using them on the enemy would be an act of war (whereas using "rogue" superhumans strains credulity somewhat less, since plenty of superhumans do go rogue)                                     

      Also how much success do you really think you'll have making the soviet population crazier/dumber just via propaganda? I mean the state controls the media and the citizens view you as evil so good luck. I don't know that there's any examples of this sort of information warfare working in the way you would need here.

      As for assassinations that seems sensible for both sides, especially with the existence of superhumans as the perfect assassin. However killing your enemies top scientists also makes sense as a tactic in a normal timeline, and I don't know how much part that played in the actual cold war.

        So use 'rogue' superhuman bio-terrorists.

        >Also how much success do you really think you'll have making the soviet population crazier/dumber just via propaganda? 

        Oh, right, 1950s, the Iron Curtain. Nevermind.

        >However killing your enemies top scientists also makes sense as a tactic in a normal timeline, and I don't know how much part that played in the actual cold war.

        The yet-unstoppable offence offered by the superhumans would make the assassinations way more successfull and easy, so I doubt our world's model of warfare is applicable here.

    You don't just want 'educated'. You want *loyal* first, and only *after* that educated. The last thing you want is to train up a superhuman who then *actually* goes rogue. Or worse, defects to the enemy.

    At the same time, you want the enemy's superhumans to defect to *you*. So you treat your superhumans really well, and make sure that the enemy superhumans *know* that you treat your superhumans really well.

    Educating people better is a long-term strategy. Elected politicians love short-term, this-will-show-results-before-I-leave-office type strategies.

      Sure you want loyalty, but that's somewhat more difficult than it seems. Especially considering how much harder it is to control extremely clever and competent people with propaganda. Of course you'll probably be helped quite a lot by just how unsettling people find the soviet union.                                              
      As for short term vs long term strategies, well that's why i'm positing a entity controlling the government that's no worried about reelection.                    
      Still if you're looking short term the best thing I can think of is to try to force as many intellectuals to take hallucinogens as possible as part of their "civil duty" in order to trigger as many eligible people to get powers as possible.

        Don't force hallucinogens down their throats. Open an Advanced Academy for Top University Students, in which the entrance exam is a thinly (or not-so-thinly) disguised test for loyalty (and is accompanied by a thorough background check) - if a few less-loyal patriots slip in, odds are their views will be changed by being surrounded all day every day by flag-wavers.

        *Then*, once they've all been living on campus for six months or so, slip the hallucinogens into the drinking water. Without telling anyone.

          Instilling patriotism that way seems rather difficult. You would really only be driving dissent into the shadows, and if you got to Mccarthyist then you raise the incentive for people to emigrate or defect. Plus it's not like a test for patriotism would be at all effective, I mean these are geniuses we're talking about. They can get their heads around the idea of lying about how much they love the government. A background check has similar problems and will only weed out those who were associated openly with groups of dissenters.

          As for slipping drugs in the water, that's really unlikely to be something you can easily cover up, and if you get caught it looks worse then forcing people to take drugs "as a matter of national security".
