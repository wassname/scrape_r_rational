  In most stories an infinite wish engine would end everything very quickly and boringly. In this one I'm expecting it to just release more danger from the other side. I'm guessing different magics/worlds cancel each other out, so she can't just wish aslan away. Hmm I wonder if the belief of the people currently living and in the area has an effect

  Also great to see the general's internal perspective. Makes him much more sympathetic and nuanced

  It's that time again. A few things to cover this week:

  * Between RR and AO3 we've hit 5,000 views in a little over 1 month since this started going up. That's crazy! So glad you all are following along, thank you.
  * The finalized cover from RHL_Shen is here and it's *beautiful.* [Check it out](https://i.imgur.com/tyc9Z1O.jpg), and [check her instagram out](https://www.instagram.com/rhl_shen/) for more good stuff.
  * We're getting into a very short timeskip today, so [here's the next character sheet for Haley](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gXYHaERqFlBl1iuEDvTM5tepfjdUYjvcKAMVNXn9G5U/edit?usp=sharing), already kind of obsolete by this Thursday.

  >He and I are walking side by side, for a time. But I’m the walkin’ *dude*, and I’ll ramble on long after he’s gone.

  Randall Flagg confirmed. Goddamn it, King, you were supposed to keep him locked up in your canon.

  A bunch of the italics at the bottom of Chapter 16 screwed up the spacing of the words around them.

  I don't quite understand what spell list Haley is using. Like, can she just select any level-appropriate spell from the whole Wizard/Sorcerer spell list or something? Because Infernal Healing seems like a strange fit for a Gold Dragon otherwise.

  Also, do dragons have some kind of general exemption from material component requirements for casting? Fleece is easy to get, but where did Haley scrounge up multiple vials of Unholy Water?

  I know that many DMs ignore that stuff, but if RAW can be applied in ludicrously favorable ways then IMO the same should be true to all the stupidly annoying limitations that pure RAW introduces.

  So, I'm afraid you've mistaken some rules here.

  https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/master-craftsman/

  Benefit: Choose one Craft or Profession skill in which you possess at least 5 ranks. You receive a +2 bonus on your chosen Craft or Profession skill. **Ranks in your chosen skill count as your caster level** for the purposes of qualifying for the Craft Magic Arms and Armor and Craft Wondrous Item feats.

  Your caster level is equal only to the **ranks** in your chosen skill, not the final bonus which would be laughably broken for the reasons you set out here. Ranks are limited by HD, and no other bonus increases them.

  However, you don't actually need caster level to craft items, as that's just the suggestion. The only real limits are for constructs. The rest can be avoided by adding 5 to the DC, so I think she can still get the candle working.
