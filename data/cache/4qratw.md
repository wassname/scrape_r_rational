  I thought it was one of, if not the, best chapters so far. Really interesting hearing from a leader's perspective.
  ```

    ```
    I was about to say this myself, but I definitely have to agree. I look forward to every chapter of this quite thoroughly, as the worldbuilding for this story is very impressive.
    ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    Thanks! Brock's chapter was all in the middle of a crisis, so I wanted to try and show some more varied roles a Gym Leader might engage in day-to-day. 

    Well, not usually all of these things in ONE day, but sometimes!

  Leader of the Rocket Gang trying to cover his tracks?

    He probably never expected that renegade to succeed. He just wanted him to try and fail so the other gym leaders would let him take charge of protecting the fossils.
    ```

    - u/DCarrier:
      ```
      That was my first guess, but if that's what he was doing he shouldn't have told the renegade anything important. Something this suspicious should not be part of plan A.
      ```

      - u/Cariyaga:
        ```
        One level deeper -- he set him up as a fall guy so the other leaders got suspicious of criminal activity that he can be publically seen to be cracking down on in pursuit of... whatever his ends are.
        ```

        - u/Icare0:
          ```
          Go deeper. Giovanni apparently had a plan to acquire, use, or study the fossils using the security personnel he would provide the excavation camp with. That plan had to be scrapped because the other leaders banded together.

          Unless this is an Indy Ploy, Giovanni effectively set up a win-win situation. Either the renegade succeeds and he get the fossils he wanted, or he fails, and Giovanni falls back to the security personnel plan, only now he has a legitimate excuse to expand his leader domains, setting a precedent for future excavations.
          ```

          - u/Cariyaga:
            ```
            Semi-canonically (IIRC, it's the case in the manga), the scientists that work on regenerating the fossils are either funded by or in the employ of Giovanni. Even were that not the case, I'd be surprised if he didn't have a hand in their actual research. They may have use in any research on Mew he was doing.
            ```

            - u/Icare0:
              ```
              I know. My point was that Giovanny didn't simply set up a scapegoat in advance. He built a complete [Xanatos Gambit](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XanatosGambit).
              ```

        - u/DCarrier:
          ```
          It seems like he could have done that with someone he was less involved in, so it would just be generally suspicious instead of specifically suspicious against him.
          ```

  - u/DrunkenQuetzalcoatl:
    ```
    Had the same thought. But problem is now he offered to protect the fossils. If they get stolen now his reputation suffers. But maybe he just needs to analyse them?
    ```

    - u/sir_pirriplin:
      ```
      He offered to protect the fossils before but was refused. Now they agreed to his proposal because a renegade tried to steal them in a completely unrelated incident. Completely unrelated. You can't prove otherwise because the renegade just died.
      ```

    - u/JulianWyvern:
      ```
      Without knowing why he wants the fossils that's a hard one to puzzle out
      ```

    - u/philip1201:
      ```
      Either that or they're valuable enough to justify the loss of reputation. If Giovanni makes a habit of lending out gym members for profit and influence, it could also be somewhat hidden in the noise of genuine failures, which don't seem to be too uncommon judging by all the mayhem and references to large-scale destruction made in the series so far.
      ```

- u/None:
  ```
  This. This chapter is why I can't wait for Red to progress in his psychic training; not only is the ability extremely useful, it adds additional 'colour' to the character's narrative that I really like. Plus, if this is how  useful being psychic is to a trainer, I can only imagine how useful being psychic would be to a professor, whose main goal is to understand Pokemon. Its the one pet peeve I have with this otherwise flawless story. I feel like Red is underestimating how incredibly useful his psychic talents are, if developed properly. To me (not that I'm some kind of super smart rationalist or anything), psychic powers would be worth a hefty investment.
  ```

  - u/Gaboncio:
    ```
    I think the issue is that we assume that Red lives in a rationalist piece of fiction, where *everyone* has been working intelligently for some purpose. Thus, talented and powerful psychics must have already made a lot of progress in the area of understanding pokemon in that regard. In fact, I think Prof. Oak has an Alakazam and can use it in his research. I think it's safe to assume that people have already picked all the low-hanging fruit in the field, so he would not gain much for himself or for the field of pokemon research by blowing all of his assets on intensive psychic training. 

    Also, that would mean he would have to miss out on adventuring through the region with Blue and Green while he trains. ;)
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      Good point. However, I think it is still a fair point that Red would have a significant edge if he developed his psychic powers. I don't mean he should put his journey on hold and pay for lesson. I just think he should be taking a more active approach towards working at unblocking his psi potential while he journeys. Like maybe he  could have asked the psychic who he spoke to if there were any exercises he could do on the road to help take down his mental blocks and develop his abilities, or he could be shown to be planning on catching a psychic pokemon, so that he can get used to mental communication; stuff like that, so that it doesn't feel like that plot element is going to be dropped for a while.

        Funny you should mention all that, as there's a certain pokemon found in the wild around Cerulean City coming up...

              This actually made me so happy :) I love psychic Pokemon the most, especially the beginning evolutions. Though I have one question; from the cartoons I watched growing up, it looked like Sabrina was basically an Alakazam herself, but in your story, Mewtwo says human psychics barely deserve the name. Just how powerful (in terms of, lets say, Pokemon levels) can human psychics become in Origin of Species, and are all psychics born equal or, even if you have the gift, is your potential decided by genetics?
              ```

              - u/DaystarEld:
                ```
                Potential is decided by genetics, just like with psychic pokemon. Generally speaking humans don't have access to anywhere near the range of pokemon's abilities, or raw strength.
                ```

- u/DaystarEld:
  ```
  This. This is why I can't promise more frequent updates. This chapter was going to be about 6,000 words. I thought I might even publish early this month. Final count, about 10,000, and I still didn't cover everything I wanted to!

  Ah well. Hope you enjoy it, and all feedback welcome!

  My podcast with /u/AlexanderWales is ready to launch, and I'll be hosting and linking to it on /r/rational and my website this weekend. Thanks again to my patrons for their continued support, and I hope to get even more content up there soon!

  Well, we got a look at Cerulean Cave. Which means... *something* is probably going on with Mewtwo, even if I'm not sure what.
  ```

- u/Mizu25:
  ```
  Good depiction of the Cerulean Cave this chapter, I must say. Really got the impression the game tried to give you from it, that it's supremely dangerous and deadly for almost all trainer who try and explore its depths. Was half-expecting the humanoid figure to be Mewtwo, honestly, but then we'd be down two humans :P

  Giovanni really showed his charisma here too, it was quite interesting seeing him bend people to his POV just by suggestions alone.
  ```

- u/Cariyaga:
  ```
  I'd been anticipating this for the past week or so, hahah. Haven't read it yet (I can't read THAT fast), but I'm looking forward to it when I get the chance to!
  ```

- u/elevul:
  ```
  Poor Misty, she didn't expect all that politics when she decided to become Gym leader...
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    Most people don't :) It's hard to see past the glamour and the prestige to the nitty gritty day to day work.
    ```

- u/Cariyaga:
  ```
  You know, this is one of those stories that I'd be nearly as happy just getting slice of life updates from a bunch of characters as actually progressing the plot. The world is honestly kind of fascinating.

  As an aside, /u/DaystarEld do you have a list of pokemon (non-spoilery, of course) you've written up that could be found in the various regions? I'm... considering GMing a pokemon game for some RL friends in a world approximately contiguous with this one, and that'd cut down on the prepwork I need to do before hand. No worries if you don't have one handy, though.
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    The list I'm operating off of is mostly the Bulbapedia page for each zone, Gen IV (HeartGold and SoulSilver). Not as convenient as a master list, but a quick reference should cover GMing needs :) What system will you be using?

  Really enjoyed this chapter. The gym leader chapters make a nice break from the travelling trio. And it's really interesting to see some of the other roles they perform on top of testing trainers.

  Giovanni comes across as a very smart antagonist, that will use his position and charisma to get things done. Should be interesting to see how things develop.
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    Glad to see so many people enjoying it :) I get a bit nervous on the interludes, since a lot of people like to stick to the main characters.
    ```

  ```
  Cool chapter, loving the setup of Cerulean cave, with all the little oddities from the games explained (single entrance/no through route exit, full of high level 'mons, only accessible after beating the Elite 4... you made it all make some degree of sense)
  ```

- u/None:

  Been bingeing the story and looking at the  chapter posts. But this is the first where the post wasn't archived. :D 

  Been really enjoying it so far. ~I like how you introduce the rational/empiricist themes more subtly than many authors do, and the characters haven't had ridiculous levels of success from the beginning simply by being more rational.

    Also really excellent worldbuilding. You've managed to make the pokemon setting as depicted make internal sense without contradicting the main parts of the canon. But also given it a lot more interesting avenues and depth. 

  Only minor ciriticism would be in characterisation, I'd have difficulty describing the main characters much other than by their loose role in the story. Doesn't meaningfully affect my enjoyment of the story though.

  Re Chapter 33

  Interestingly we seem to see far more in battle switching in this interlude than in the battles before. That and the references to sweepers, etc makes em think that competitive battling in this is going to look more like the real world competitive metagame than the anime. Which makes sense if you have competent people competing and refining their techniques over time. Though the pokemon switching in the real world does depend heavily on type pairing, which seems not to operate the same way in this world. A potential overlap between Red and Blue’s 

  Its good also to get a sense of how someone becomes a gym leader, and how that interacts with the Champion system. Still not super clear what the elite 4 do. Dooes a trainer have to beat them and the champion like in the games? Or is the champion decided by a tournament like in the show? 

  It occurs to me that we haven’t really had a good in-universe explanation of why gyms specialise on a particular type of pokemon. Given their role as defence and training centres that would seem a disadvantage. 

  The after event review is also good and gives us a sense of how competent the movers in the setting are and how seriously they take incidents. I often hear people decry that sort of beaurocracy but it can be very useful. 

  Is “ no doubt as to efficacy the of ACE *training*” a typo or is he referring to the training programme rather than the trainers?

    Yeah, the anime's so full of weird move usage and type matchups, even at the top level of the championships, that I pretty much ignore it when thinking of what a competitive meta would look like in favor of examining the games (with some exceptions, like the power of pokemon like onix)

    >Dooes a trainer have to beat them and the champion like in the games? Or is the champion decided by a tournament like in the show?

    It'll be more like the game.

    >It occurs to me that we haven’t really had a good in-universe explanation of why gyms specialise on a particular type of pokemon. Given their role as defence and training centres that would seem a disadvantage.

    Yeah this hasn't been explored yet, but basically it's a mix of cultural norms, personal preference, and promoting a wide range of "experts."  You don't want your best trainers in the region to all be specialized in training just 3 or 4 types of pokemon, after all: while a gym leader's "real team" consists of every kind of pokemon, their specialty ensures that they're the go-to expert on a given type, incase one is needed.

    >Is “ no doubt as to efficacy the of ACE training” a typo or is he referring to the training programme rather than the trainers?

    He's referring to the programme, yes :)
