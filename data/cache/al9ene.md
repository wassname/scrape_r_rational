## What is the true definition of the genre 'Self-Insert'?

### Post:

I have seen three different definitions for 'Self-Insert,' or SI for the rest of this discussion.


The first and least likely (IMO) is that SI means Portal-Fantasy/Isekia. This is not true, but I do believe *ALL* SIs are Portal-Fantasys (PF) but not all PFs are SIs. So SIs need to be described as a subset of PFs and not PFs unto themselves.


The second definition is that SI's protagonists are a representation of the author put into the fantasy and thus the author *self-inserts* him/herself into said fantasy. This is the original definition I believed before I heard the third definition. This one is also the most confused definition. I see other people using this as a tag for books that should not be SIs.


The third (and what I believe to be true) definition is that a SI is about a character who has almost omnipotent knowledge about the universe that the character is shoved into. An example would be a person from our Earth reads the Harry Potter books and gets Portal-ed through into the Harry Potter world (and from what I understand about Harry Potter SIs, you immediately start banging Hermione) . This makes them a self-insert into a PF with almost-omnipotent knowledge about the world.


Examples: Worth the Candle, With This Ring 


So what is the true definition of the genre 'Self-Insert'? Did I get all of the various definitions correct? Is the second definition correct? If so what is the correct genre-tag for the third definition? Does anyone have a good Harry Potter SI with the third definition?

  "True"?

  The term "self-insert" is used for all of those things. Your first definition is a special case of the second where the character is literally "inserted" into the story. Your third definition is a special case of the first where the inserted character has pre-existing knowledge of the setting.

  My understanding is that your second definition is the original one, if it matters. If you use the term "self-insert" outside of fanfiction communities, then most people will believe that you are talking about a character who is not *literally* the author, but who nonetheless clearly *represents* the author. The term is often used condescendingly to refer to Mary Sue wish-fulfillment stuff also, because there is a fair amount of overlap between the concepts. But the character usually does at least have a different name. In this sense, "self-insert" isn't a genre, it's a writing criticism. Since this can often be open to interpretation, it isn't especially useful as a tag.

  The story set-up of "Me, the actual author from the real world, physically transported into the story" is a much more niche thing. You're not likely to find much of this on dead trees, but it does make a decent launching point for unabashed fixfic and fixfic subversions, and it's popular enough that it needed a name. In this sense, the term "self-insert" *is* useful as a tag.

  Any story can *have* a self-insert character, who is not literally the author. But a story explicitly tagged "self-insert" as a genre ought to be the portal fantasy one, where the main character almost always has extraordinary knowledge because they are the author and the author usually wouldn't be writing themselves into a setting they don't know. Any other usage would be poor communication, I think.

  I wouldn't call SI a genre so much as a feature. Sort of like rationalism is a feature that can be part of a story in any genre. SI is simply a story where the author asks "what would I do in the MC's position.

  Issekai elements are unnecessary. The MC doesn't have to have the author's actual life in their backstory. Omnipotence is similarly unnecessary. That's more likely in a wish fulfillment set up than a purely SI one.

  The problem I have is describing stories where the author does self-inserts with other people.

  That is instead of self-inserting into Stalin in 1912 they put Stalin from 1940 in Stalin in 1912. Calling it an ISOT may be accurate but these stories often share a lot of similarities with SI.

  Another example is the story on AH.com of a guy waking up in Hitler's body, the guy isn't actually the author since he's written the insert to be a nazi but otherwise its clearly very similar.

  What do you call these nonself-inserts? Other-inserts?

  Insert as a genre is perhaps more broad.

- u/MrCogmor:

  The second definition is the correct one. Self insert is a term for when an author inserts themselves into a story as a fictional character. That character is the self insert. Self insert fics are typically isekai but don't have to be. It is perfectly possible to write an SI fic where the self insert gets super powers, wins the lottery, meets the partner of their dreams, dates celebrities or whatever without getting summoned to another world.

  Your third definition is just a variant of isekai. There are plenty where the protagonist enters a world that just so happens to match up to a MMO or other media product that they know very well.

  &#x200B;

  Worth The Candle is an isekai but not an SI (Unless Joon resembles the author more than I think he does).

  With This Ring is an SI and isekai.

    Wtc is tagged as SI by the author if that information is useful to you.

  Welcome to english, a language where a word may have any number of definitions.

  (3 is fairly low, but there's at least that many again in the comments.)

- u/None:
  ```
  Yeah, the second is most correct, except for the fact that people usually write about a somewhat idealised version of themselves instead of actually writing about themselves. I call this the "I choose as my best self." fallacy of SI fix.

  The third definition is something I can't agree with. I'm writing a multiverse SI. In the first world, a God wipes my character's memories before she's born. In the next, her soul gets cut into three pieces, of which only one is aware of the setting. In the remainder, my character dies in the real world at around 147 years of age, and often can't remember much about the settings she finds herself in, because that sort of asymmetry makes it much easier to write a story where she doesn't repeatedly curbstomp the settings she finds herself in while keeping things rational.
