  [](#s "At least JFKâ€™s notorious obsession with space had yielded real benefits in communication here on Earth once NASA had finally given up on the ridiculous goal of trying to reach the Moon and focused on affordable launches to low Earth orbit.")


  Is this the earliest evidence of the timeline splitting from ours that we've had? I think it was mentioned that supers emerged relatively recently, but if this indicates that something was different going as far back as this, then perhaps there's more to be uncovered about super origins.

    Just for fun (because I don't think I'll get a chance to spell this out in the text any time soon):

    32) Franklin D. Roosevelt, 1933 - 1949

    33) Thomas Dewey, 1949 - 1953

    34) Dwight D. Eisenhower, 1953 - 1961

    35) John F. Kennedy, 1961 - 1973

    36) Robert F. Kennedy, 1973 - 1981

    37) Ronald Reagan, 1981 - 1989

    38) Ted Kennedy, 1989 - 1997

    39) Bill Clinton, 1997 - 2009

    40) John F. Kennedy, Jr., 2009 - Present

    Vigorous disagreement with items on this list as ridiculous is strongly encouraged.

      So, FDR survives through to complete his 4th term, and without having inherited the Presidency and won WW2 Truman loses to Dewey.

      I would think in that case that Warren as VP would be more likely to succeed Dewey than Eisenhower. I'd also expect Dewey to get two terms. Truman only served one "extra" term since he was riding out FDR's last term, but a popular President riding on presumably the same wave of massive post war economic growth would be likely to win re-election I think, especially not against an primary challenge from Eisenhower. Did, perhaps, something go very amiss during Dewey's Presidency? If that's the case, likely to be international and probably a Soviet threat if it didn't backlash onto the Republicans like I would expect a domestic scandal to. Perhaps early Soviet supers aiding in militaristic expansion? A Korean War that went quickly and decisively against the Americans?

      Notable that JFK serves 3 terms as does Clinton, so the 22nd Amendment doesn't exist. That plus four Kennedy's suggests that Delphic-verse America is much more comfortable with dynastic, long-serving power than is real America. Plus, the absence of Nixon and the presumed lack of a Lewinsky scandal for Clinton suggests that trust in government would be overall much higher than it is presently.

      All that makes Delphic's use of reticence to cooperate fully with the government as a screen to hide his powers probably more suspicious to the feds than it would be IRL, which might be what prompts the CIA to send someone after him.

      The degree to which the American feds are tip-toeing around the Canadian ones in the Lamarck investigation, though, prompts me to do some egregious theory-crafting and wonder if the Korean War went decisively against the Americans prompting less unilateral action throughout the Cold War and more of a reliance on NATO and other alliances. The failure to reach the moon also signals an inability to attain decisive nuclear strike superiority. America becomes more of a first-among-equals in the 1st world rather than a preeminent superpower. FDR's success in WW2 combined with America having less ability to push liberal democracy as the only alternative to communist dictatorships allows a flourishing, or at least less of a decline in the Great Man theory of history. This, combined with the emergence of superpowers results in an uneasy acceptance of a hierarchical, oligarchic society that remains a democracy on the surface but still very obviously favors the privileged and the powerful.

      Kennedy isn't assassinated, which means there isn't as much political will both for the Apollo program, but also the Civil Rights, Voting Rights, and Fair Housing acts. They're eventually passed, but racial lines crystallize as part of the new American hierarchy, hence Hector and Paris' being hyper-sensitive and aware of it, despite IRL Detroit being ~85% black, and also Vill's tacit endorsement of profiling and her sensitivity to drawing attention to racial lines.

      Also lends credence to Hector's desire to accumulate mass wealth without specific plans for it, as the issues surrounding wealth inequality and social class in America are likely even worse in the Delphic-verse.

    A similar split is mentioned in chapter 4:

    [](#s "As the ride progressed, I noticed that the driver had not taken any of the obvious routes to Robby, which was the destination listed on the app. Robert F. Kennedy International Airport, named after the second President of the illustrious Kennedy dynasty that had so slickly dominated politics since the 60s, was nestled along the D.C. Beltway and a short if clogged ride from downtown. Perhaps there had been a miscommunication as to the correct airport - they had turned onto a route heading west, towards Teddy (both airports being named after Kennedys providing all the evidence as to who owned this town). It would take nearly an hour at this time of day, even on a Sunday, to get into the northern Virginia countryside where much of the domestic traffic was relegated.")

    Now, honest question: should I have responded myself, or is this the sort of thing I should wait to let other readers figure out?

      For me, personally, I think that's a perfect level of author feedback - pointing out the textual answer to a question without suggesting anything that it might point to.

      One of the things that occasionally grinds at me in rational fiction is the frequency with which "puzzles" are embedded that require details from far back in the story to make sense of. That kinda, maybe, sorta works in fully published works of fiction where you might consume them over a period of days or weeks, but in serials where the relevant info might have been dropped months or years ago it creates something of a barrier to entry for fully appreciating the work.

      I definitely understand the desire not to raise the reader's alert by foreshadowing something both early in the work and then again five minutes before it happens, a la "Previously On..." segments that open up TV shows, but appreciate not having to skim through everything published up until this point to answer a question.

      Thanks!

  Delphic is a superhero story about Hector, a young man in Detroit with the ability to see the past and the present. It follows his attempts to leverage this unusual ability to do good in the world while remaining behind the scenes, keeping both his identity and the truth of his powers secret from those who would see him as a threat.

  Story threads will focus on several characters as Hector encounters them:

  * Hector's sister, Paris, a homicide detective hiding her own power,
  * Doc Stevens, a disgraced scientist at the forefront of research on the source of super powers, and
  * The exploits of various "Super Teams": government-run groups of supers whose scope of operations have been steadily growing.
