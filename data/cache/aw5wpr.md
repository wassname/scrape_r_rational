## [D] Friday Open Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.

      Wow, thanks for doing all of that work to investigate and guess at his motivations. I appreciate knowing why he left even if it's not completely certain if this is the actual reason. New Year's resolution to quit reddit/change his Internet profile is a lot better than the other reasons I was thinking of.

    Why do people do that? Delete their account? I can understand leaving, but not choosing to eliminate all of your comments.

    I'll miss him. I liked reading his comments and he was good about being a fair moderator.

      When you delete your account, all of your comments remain, the username is just changed to [deleted]. If you want to wipe out your entire Reddit history you have to do a script to manually delete all of the comments prior to account deletion. So thankfully in this case a whole bunch of Reddit threads haven't been decimated and made unreadable.

        Ah. I misunderstood some things then. I had been seeing a lot of deleted comments recently, so I accidentally assumed that comments are deleted with an account's deletion.

        Thanks for clarifying.

    Hadn’t they just started grad school? Maybe in light of anticipated busyness they decided reddit not worth the time, and deleted their account to help remove any further temptation.

  Hello. I wrote a thing. My writing group told me to post it here already, but I feel like I can still revise a few awkward sentences on it. Can I bother you guys to check it out? It's only about 2000 words.

  If the writing is bad, half of it's because it's my first time writing fiction and the other half is that English is my second language.

  Constructive criticism would be great.

  - u/sl236:

    Nice start.

    My biggest nitpick would be - consider deciding whether you are writing in past tense or present tense, and sticking to it.

    The room they were in **was** (...) **It's** shaped like (...) The entire area **is** (...) long flat wooden timbers *lined* the floor.
    (...) Pierce **was standing** along with (...) All three **wore** (...) **it is said to be** the unofficial Athenaeum uniform. (...) graduate student **is also trying** to use (...) 

    etc etc - flipping tenses every other sentence kept jolting me out of the story.

    There were two main problems for me.

    1) [square brackets].

    So when the first [light] appeared I liked it, as it very elegantly communicated there was something magical about the light, but as the chapter went along I found my self dislikeing the way square square brackets were used. For me, a square bracket slightly breaks up the flow of the story. This is useful to signify something special but when used to commonly I found it just made some paragraphs hard to read. 

    I don't know how I would fix this apart from using bold or some other, slightly less intrusive, visually different text.

    The fact that square brackets are used for both [classes] and [skills] also added to the confusion. Take this extract for example:

    >The [Sergeant] and the remaining two [Seekers] drew longswords, enchanted with [Reach] and [Sharpness]. The [Sergeant] used his command skills, but it only affected his squad. All nine of them felt the [Standard-bearer's] auras when he held his tower shield up.

    We have classes and skills being called right next to each other and no easy visual way to tell which is which.  

    I would personally recommend only using visually different names for the [skills] and just useing capitals for the Classes. 

    2)I am a little confused.

    Now this could just be me being an idiot but I felt like there was a lot of stuff I just didn't quite get. Lile I know Emerys is part of an organization called the Athenaeum but what is the Athenaeum. Is it a school? An independent magic run State? Why are they sending Emerys to fight a monster instead of someone more qualified? Why is Emerys haveing all those powers at a young age impressive? What do the characters actually do as members of the Athenaeum, apart from randomly fighting monsters? Most importantly why are the characters, risking their lives, fighting the monsters?

    They say the moster can wipe out a party of adventurous but there is no explanation of how strong a party of adventurers is so I don't know how impressive that is.

    I just kind of feel as a lot of context to what is going on that I'm missing.

    Having someone introduce and explain stuff towards the beginning would  ofeen helpful.


    The main thing I liked the emphasis on classes and skills over higher numbers. The number creep is something I feel ruins a lot of lit RPGs.
    ```

    - u/GaiusCoffee:
      ```
      Yeah, I heard the bracket problem with my writing group as well. It actually started with [[Classes]] and [Skills]. I'll think about capitalizing the Classes and leaving the brackets on skills only.

      Regarding 2), I had a choice of doing an info dump for a first chapter, and that would've solved the problem. A zoomed out view of the world, showing events that give context.

      However, I decided against it. I'll try to do some epistolary stuff instead, with excerpts from in-world books (Encyclopae Arcana & Anomalous Maleficarum, available on site's sidebar) for context. Just like Brandon Sanderson's Ars Arcana.

      I'm going to flesh the world out more on the next chapter, including the why's of the Athenaeum. To be honest, I want those questions to act as a hook for the more curious readers, while giving others a couple of fight scenes immediately :)

  So I finally bought the latest Within Temptation album, [Resist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7sOZ_TFUXg&list=PLBzBwYhHpqLL54JjxLKjr3R1LK5IjvY5q). Originally I'd been mainly interested in the opener, The Reckoning, and Raise Your Banner. Despite their Electro-leaning sounds, they delivered on what I like Within Temptation for: Awesome lyrics that paint a scene in my head.  
  The rest of the album was nice, too, even if I generally preferred their stuff from Silent Force.

  However, now that I've listened to the whole album a few times, there's one song that really stands out: [Firelight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JHgGD8p91M&list=PLBzBwYhHpqLL54JjxLKjr3R1LK5IjvY5q&index=7). This one is *so different* from what I've come to expect from Within Temptation. I wouldn't even call it Symphonic Metal. To be frank, I have *no ide* what I would call it. Which is a pity, because I really like it, and wish I could find more like that.

  Do you guys have any recommendations?

  My personal life overshare thread GO:

  1. Turns out I am still doing my fatal crash investigation job until I go on my sabattical, yay! Which is good because I was not looking forward to going to work for Evil Boss again and only for three months which is super disruptive for a project management gig I reckon

  2. Corporate restructure is happening, my team is moving to another part of the org. My Evil Boss is coming with us, but my Awesome Grandboss isn't, so I'm scared. Optimistically hoping that New Grandboss will try and force Evil Boss to be competent. Also, the new area will hopefully let me diversify my skill set, which would be excellent. 

  3. As previously mentioned I'm going to be in Sydney ~21-23rd March with nothing to do, if anyone wants to grab a coffee

  I'm fluent in English and Russian, and I'm interested in doing freelance translation. If anyone here has any experience with this kind of job in particular, or with freelance at all, I'd appreciate advice on some general topics. Such as:

  How do I start? What platforms should I use? What beginner mistakes should I look out for? How should/shouldn't I negotiate with clients?

  (And yes, I'm aware that the entire translation market is likely going to be decimated within a decade by advanced AIs. Doesn't mean I can't leverage this skill while it's still relevant.)
  ```

  - u/sl236:
    ```
    As no-one else has replied: I did this for a while, albeit over twenty years ago, so don’t know how much of my experience is relevant. Start off by registering with translation companies in your area - they keep lists of people they can farm work out to, and will generally want you to do a short trial piece. Also register with law enforcement and courts, who similarly keep lists and will need people on short notice. Build your network from there, taking care to avoid breaching noncompete clauses in your contracts. The one issue with this approach is refusing work, or not getting it done on time, gets you moved to the bottom of the lists, so you can’t really afford to do either even when already overworked and end up with periods of idleness alternating with periods of horrible crunch.
    ```

  - u/alexshpilkin:
    ```
    If you’re going for technical translation, be aware that translation companies that are large and/or based in Russia can and will rip you off. As in pay you about a quarter of what you could’ve earned had you spoken directly with their client or (more frequently) with a smaller international company. Unfortunately, most big tech companies who care enough about Russian customers to maintain a permanent presence there are more likely to deal only with big translation companies, so it is kind of a balancing act, I hear.

    As for a starting point... try ProZ, I guess?

  The off-topic thread used to be posted in "new" order. Is it a failed experiment and thus the open thread is now being posted in "best" order, or did our benevolent moderators forget to update the default sort when they set up the automatic thread posting?

  - u/alexanderwales:

    Fixed, I think. It was there, but not working. We'll see next Friday. I've manually set the sort for now.

  I have a few stories/fanfic I would like to write and upload so I can get some feedback on them. What is the best option for hosting them?

  I have concerns about anonymity so a website where I can delete my account and everything I have written would be preferred.

    ```
    To add to what /u/MagicWeasel said, Ao3 also has a mechanism for “orphaning” your story and forever disconnecting it from your account and name but leaving it alive, if you don’t mind the story’s existence but don’t want it to be connected to you.

    ```
    Archive Of Our Own has a better privacy policy than FanFiction.net, and a much better interface. Check it out and see if it meets your needs.
