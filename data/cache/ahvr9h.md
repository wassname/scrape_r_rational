## I read an IIRC nonfiction short story written by a guy about his suicide and I want to find it.

### Post:

All I remember that it was probably 1st person narration, the guy was exeriencing a kind L’Étranger-ish alienation towards everything, and was trying with therapy (I recall dialogue with therapist), and... not much else.

[Edit:] Narrator was a 30-something US male, and there were scenes of driving.

Edit:] We have a winner, Good Old Neon, by Dawid Foster Wallace. It seems I was sorta right about it being autobiographical.

  ```
  Just out of curiosity, why do you want to read this? Feel free to ignore this if it's too personal.

    I remember it being pretty well written and kinda relevant to me. Yes, a bit of call of the void too.
    ```
