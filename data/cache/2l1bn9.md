  How did no one see *Mindscrape* coming? I mean ... the obvious solution is to have a trusted confederate *Mindscrape* you to remove the details you don't want known before you go up against someone that you suspect might use *Mindscrape* on you.

  (Of course, it's possible that they *did* do this, and left all the other stuff in order to convince Afi that he has them dead to rights, but that seems unlikely. I guess I'll need to know what the plan is, but giving away secrets that didn't need to be given away seems bad unless there are more layers involved.)

    There's also the slightly neater possibility of sacrificing the knowledge and secrets to Herrun and trusting that she'll return them at the right moment, though given how much of her is Loki at this point, that's probably not a very smart bet to make.

      Ooh, that's a really cool idea. Wish I'd thought of it.

  Phew, last minute drop.  I spent most of the week writing the novelette for the first stretch goal on the Kickstarter...which, I fully recognize, will cut no ice (Icefi?) with 2YE readers.  I got so absorbed that I didn't realize I hadn't worked on 2YE until this morning.  *blush*

  Anyway, here we go -- big things are starting.

  Even if they had some Anti-Mindscrape preps, Suze joining the group may have screwed some plans
  ```

  ```
  Why is Suze not an 80-levelled munchkin by now like everyone else?
  ```

  - u/eaglejarl:
    ```
    It's a combination of a couple of things: unconscious social expectations (mousey young women are not combatants and do not become legendary figures of power) and category stability. Jake and the others have mentally filed Suze in the category "Jake's secretary", and it would take a conscious effort to notice that she could be reassigned. So far, they've all been too focused to think of it. 

    Of course, the fact that Suze is too unassertive to ask for it doesn't help either.
    ```
