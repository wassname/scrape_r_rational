## [Q][D][BST] Is there any interest in a rational/ist Mecha story?

### Post:

Until it started having irrecoverable graphics issues, I was playing *MechWarrior 4: Mercenaries* and enjoying it a lot, with the primordial stages of a tale of a mecha pilot in a horrendous situation.

If people want to talk about it I'll make a follow-up BST post with some of the rough ideas and go from there.

So, /r/rational, what do you want in a mecha story?

  I'd love to see it, because mecha are pretty much the trope codifier for Rule of Cool.

  That said, you're going to have a really tough time of it.  There are pretty much no conditions under which upright human tanks are the optimal combat design.  Here are some of the problems you'll need to find answers to:

  * Mecha are basically a giant pile of shot traps strapped together.  
  * Tanks are relatively low-lying and can hide behind terrain features pretty well.  Mecha can't, unless they lie down, at which point they are just inefficiently designed tanks.
  * Realistic mecha will be slow moving and their weight will put incredible strain on their joints.  Fast-moving agile mecha are science fantasy.
  * One of the benefits of mecha that often gets quoted is hands, but the only advantage hands have is that they allow holding / manipulating a variety of tools.  A fighting machine doesn't really need a variety of tools:  it needs "blow thing up" and "blow thing up more".  
  * Tanks can center-axis mount their weapons in order to absorb recoil, mecha can't unless you put it in the chest, in which case you've given up the advantage of hands.  Even then, you're an unstable two-legged upright pole instead of a low-lying box with long fat treads.
  * A gun built into the arm is just a tank barrel.  A hand-carried gun will by necessity have a smaller ammo capacity than what a tank with equivalent technology could mount.  It probably also can't hit as hard, due to needing to be more miniaturized.

  Here are a couple of ideas for how you could justify having them:

  * If mecha combat is a sporting event -- basically mecha gladiators for the entertainment of the masses.
  * If they are built as highly mobile rough-country artillery platforms instead of as close-quarters fighters.
  * If the mecha are old gladiator rigs left over from a more civilized era and now being repurposed as weapons of war because they hit hard even though they are impractical.  Bonus points if they're being used by the ragtag misfit rebels against the vastly more powerful imperial troops of DarkEvil McBadGuy.
  * If the mecha are actually captured exoskeletons of a much larger race, being appropriated by humans because they are the only things that hit hard enough to penetrate the other race's armor.  (You then need to deal with square-cube law issues as you explain your larger aliens, and why aliens and humans are fighting in a universe that makes interstellar contact, let alone combat, extremely nonsensical.)

    Or maybe not part of a sporting event, but some kind of propaganda effort - you have tanks to get the work of warfare done, and humongous mecha in order to splash up on the television, walk in parades, and in general be more impressive than strictly practical.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      So basically, the plot of the *Captain America* movie (yes I am watching that right now), but with giant robots.
      ```

      - u/eaglejarl:
        ```
        Except that Cap really *was* effective.  Not in an armored role (tank, APC), but in an infantry, especially special forces role.
        ```

        - u/alexanderwales:
          ```
          Well, effective is more a question of *cost* than just results. There's no doubt that Cap performed admirably in his role, but we don't know how much the super serum program cost the military, and it might be that return on investment was quite a bit lower than simply finding and training some more conventional special forces. Though it's complicated by the fact that the program was sabotaged at very nearly the exact worst moment.

          As far as mechs go, I can see them possibly being effective on the field, just not the most sensible investment given the costs involved with making and/or maintaining them *unless* there's some kind of secondary motivation like propaganda, entertainment, or an idiot ruler that wants something that looks cool.

            I almost wish this trope could make a comeback.

    Another possible justification would be a radically different operating environment than the sort where tanks are used. Check out Blame! for an example of an environment where the ability to climb would be extremely useful.

    Rational Mobile Fighter G Gundam please. That could totally work.

    The way they control their Mobile Suits justifies the human shape. The concept of having the human government decided by a large scale gladiator tournament would be a bit difficult to make not-silly though.

      You can *rationalize* the Shining Gundam and Devil Gundam?

      It works better than the United Nations.

      I'm not familiar with the Gundam series...is MFGG a gladiator thing?

      TVTropes has this to say about why Gundam managed to make mecha a sensible combat choice:
      >Yoshiyuki Tomino wanted to write a Real Robot anime. However, anyone remotely familiar with either engineering or military tactics will tell you that such devices are almost impossible to effectively use; a bipedal platform is needlessly complicated, hard to properly armor, and the easiest thing to shoot at in a battlefield. Enter the Minovsky Particle: an EMP-like, sensor-jamming, delicate-electronics wrecking Plot Device that not only renders all ranged targeting and guided missiles useless, but requires Helium-3 to produce. Consequently, humans had to go to space to get Helium-3, fight old-school close combat battles using systems capable of tricky microgravity maneuvering, and eventually expand on the technology to make maintenance easier. 

      I'm still not sure that I buy that mecha are the optimal design, even under these conditions -- seems to me you could do all the same things with something shaped more like a fly-by-wire jet, but meh.

      >The way they control their Mobile Suits justifies the human shape.

      How do they control their suits?
      ```

      - u/logrusmage:
        ```
        >I'm not familiar with the Gundam series...is MFGG a gladiator thing?

        Basically yes. Each nation is represented by a mech at a big tournament thing to decide who gets to be the head of their UN-like organization.

        It is totally unrelated to basically all of the other Gundamn series, though I think technically they shove it in the time line somewhere.

        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_Fighter_G_Gundam

        >How do they control their suits?

        In the G series only they use a full body mimicry deal.

        Observe:

        http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-nnK0HElto

        >Unlike previous series in the Gundam franchise which are set in the "Universal Century" timeline, Mobile Fighter G Gundam takes place in an alternate "Future Century" universe.[1][2] Within this timeline, much of mankind has abandoned a ruined Earth to live in space colonies. The countries on Earth have corresponding colonies just outside the planet's atmosphere. Rather than fight wars for political and social dominance, the colonies agree to hold a "Gundam Fight" tournament every four years. Each country sends to Earth a representative piloting a highly-advanced, humanoid mobile fighter called a Gundam. The Gundams compete with one another in one-on-one battles, under a strict set of rules, until only one fighter remains; the nation represented by the winner earns the right to rule all of space for that period.[2] Each Gundam is controlled directly by the user within the cockpit using the "Mobile Trace System", a gesture recognition and feedback mechanism whereby the Gundam mimics the pilot's own body motion, combat skills, and weapon-wielding capabilities.[1] G Gundam opens at the start of the 13th Gundam Fight in Future Century year 60 and follows Neo Japan's Domon Kasshu, fighter of his nation's Shining Gundam and bearer of the coveted "King of Hearts" martial arts crest.[1] Aside from winning the tournament, Domon's mission is to track down his fugitive, older brother Kyoji, who allegedly stole the experimental Dark Gundam from Neo Japan's government, leaving their mother dead and their father (Dr. Raizo Kasshu) to be arrested and placed in a cryogenic state.[3]

  You really have to ask?

  ETA: Our amazing worldbuilder /u/krakonfour did some work with mechas in his Iron Giant setting. The series of links is [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2cmtk3/krakonfours_rational_workshop/). Maybe give it a read, AO.

  The biggest thing to take into account: realistic mecha aren't heavy armor. Instead, they're light, stealthy, mobile urban assault forces. Basically, think ground helicopter.

  A mecha can't move as fast as a tank across flat ground, in the same way that a helicopter can't go in a straight line as fast as a fixed-wing aircraft. They can't carry as much payload, they are less efficient, and they aren't anywhere near as durable.

  However, mecha are far more maneuverable, particularly in the ways that let you dodge behind buildings or pop up and down behind a small hill. A pile of rubble, like you'd get from a destroyed building, is an insurmountable obstacle to anything on wheels or tracks but a wide-open highway to a mecha. Balancing and crouching (shorter levers) means they can hugely vary their carrying capacity, which when combined with hands (built-in cargo cranes) lets them engage a wide variety of threats.

  A typical engagement against a mecha will have it running down cross streets so that it can appear in random places to toss a single missile from its external rack and then disappear back into the mess to find another place to hit you. If anything big enough to whack it gets line of effect, it'll dodge down another street or into a building and run away. If you change what you're using to hunt it, it'll grab a weapons cache that it carried in before it engaged and come back with weapons that counter your hunters.

    Ok, you are *clever*, and *right*.  The ideal "rational" mecha is basically something almost *Iron Man*-like, or about the size of the plain (uncombined) Lagann: fundamentally a design for nimble but mighty urban warfare in situations where "firebomb the site from the air" just doesn't work (usually for political reasons).

    I can now see a mecha series about the future occupation of Iraq.
    ```

      For more dangerous(/SPIDERS) territory, the Israel/Palestinian war fought via mecha.

      For a technical note, as you might already be aware the Iron Man model is implausible because it needs to violate conservation of momentum in order to not hurt the human wearing it. The smallest you can plausibly go is about twice the size of the reassembled armor Stane uses in the first movie. This can be overridden if you have it as a remote-piloted humanoid drone, which has its advantages especially in comparatively early stages of robot war adoption since you probably have a bunch of Special Forces around who can use their already-developed instincts to pilot them.

      This also puts it at about twice the size of Lagann, I think. The pinballing effect it has would be a problem even if it was less cartoonishly exaggerated.
      ```

      - u/alexanderwales:
        ```
        Oh man, I would love to see the Israel/Palestine conflict done with mechas. But I have to imagine that the number of people who could tell a complex story involving giant mechas is pretty low, let alone one that involves a real-world conflict.
        ```

- u/ArmokGoB:
  ```
  Sensibly designed mechs. Not giant mechanical humans or even animals, but tanks made for some different kind of warfare they are then shown of in; for the most mechlike results, probably climbing and jumping around in/on skyscrapers, forest canopies, and mountains far to steep for rolling-type locomotion.
  ```

  - u/Escapement:
    ```
    Muv-Luv had a fairly reasonable Mech-usage-case explanation - basically, they were fighting enemies that had extremely powerful weaponry that took a little while to target things, so higher mobility and the ability to move in and out of cover rapidly was required (which treaded vehicles couldn't provide in sufficient usefulness). 

    As a bonus for rationalist fiction: [Spoiler for explanation of major plot points](#s " the alien invading enemies are essentially tools of a badly written semi-paperclipper non-recursively-improving but badly programmed AI created by silicon life-forms to harvest the universe for materials for their own use, and the AI doesn't recognize carbon-based life as a possibility - it's basically viewing casualties etc as hostile environmental conditions.")

  Some reasoning behind the shapes of the mecha. Human-shaped robots if you can get away with them, legged tanks if you can't.
  ```

- u/Traiden04:
  ```
  I would recommend Patlabor, this would be right up the ally of many people here I should think. Its focus is on a police department set up specifically to handle mecha crimes using mecha of their own. 1988 anime series and quite surprising for its time.

  Check [this](http://youtu.be/dVMEjDL2fbI?list=PLNC_sRuPtMonAOP46gqW9Q6E4ESFmum6d) out. I think it's a pretty good deconstruction of a lot of things, giant robots not really being one of them.

  Mostly freedom fighters, terrorism, and colonialism.
  ```

- u/mack2028:
  ```
  yes. if i may pose a thought, perhaps the reason for the robots being shaped like people is that hands are a good multi purpose platform and when you are building a large war machine you want to make it easy to use, a neural interface would be easy but perhaps unsettling and clumsy if you make the robot not human shaped.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    > hands are a good multi purpose platform

    Yeah they are.  That's why you should attach them to giant spiders.
