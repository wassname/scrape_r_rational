  Any chance of integration with rationalreads?  Seems like a natural fit :).

  Hi! Thanks to your feedback in the previous thread I've improved the homepage and added some features, and now I want to share with you the first version of the website =)

  Please let me know what you think, I'll gladly receive some feedback and critique and build features that you request.

  Is there any possibility of automating the transfer of stories from other fic-hosting sites?(Similar to what AO3 does for all websites but FFN)
  ```

  - u/raymestalez:
    ```
    I already have a script that imports stories from FFN, I just haven't built an interface for it yet. This feature is definitely coming.

    For now, if you want to import your stories from any site - just let me know, and I'll do that for you.

  So yeah, make of that what you will
  ```

  - u/raymestalez:
    ```
    Oh, it was *very* unwise of me to edit the website right after the launch.

    Sorry for that, now all should be fixed.
    ```

- u/None:
  ```
  So *that* finally happened.
