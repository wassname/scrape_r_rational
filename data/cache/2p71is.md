  Are we absolutely sure that no Omnicidal Maniac is going to put a Helm of Opposite Alignment on any schmuck who went through the FLEA in their sleep and have them PAO up a black hole?

    Nope.

    I don't think anyone but the assault team, Suze, and Afi know about Black Holes.
    ```

      All the gods now as well, right?

      And anyone who manages to get a mindscrape off on any of the people who know.

        Which notably includes Afi.

          Yeah, that's the rub.

            Afi is powerful, paranoid, and not omnicidal. I'm worried neither about him deciding to destroy everything nor him getting mindscraped. Anyone on the Prime Material Plane should be safe from black holes from his corner.
            ```

        I think the gods are going to be pretty hush hush on the subject of "Thing that can kill a god". As to the Mindscrape, it is mind-affecting. I can't see why every person who has been through FLEA wouldn't keep a permanent Mind Blank on for quick and easy immunity to that, plus a contingent Mind Blank and or Programmed Amnesia in the event of a Mindscrape.

        It's really the most dangerous spell available.

  Whoa, Suze's going through some rough shit.

  Always a pleasure to read
