    New to me :/ But I've been out for a couple of weeks, so. Mostly, I haven't seen any of The Last Angel posted here in I think over a year.

    The whole series is pretty decent and while the uploads might be fairly spaced out, thereâ€™s a decent backlog and some other well written stories by the same author.
