## [D] Monday General Rationality Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics!  Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world?  Have you:

* Seen something interesting on /r/science?
* Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
* Figured out how to become immortal?
* Constructed artificial general intelligence?
* Read a neat nonfiction book?
* Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?

  A lot of us are really interested in tracking brain science, and speculating about brain uploads/emulations/artificial intelligence. I've always felt that the predictions people made about how this stuff would progress was naive, though. [Recent news](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/01/brain-cells-can-share-information-using-a-gene-that-came-from-viruses/550403/) seems to validate that opinion, as it turns out that there's an entire rna capsule based messaging system that's independently evolved in everything from mammals to fish to insects, and seems to be critical for long term memory formation. 

  What's everyone's take on this? Does anyone think we'll be seeing advances in AI from investigating this? What does everyone hunk about how this pushes the feasibility of uploading, considering his is probably one of dozens of similar black box process necessary for brain emulations?

    It would push back the timeline (whatever that is; not being an expert, I've decided to peg it at "sometime after I'm dead" and to be pleasantly surprised if it happens more quickly than that) but in principle, isn't this something that could also be picked apart, understood, and eventually accounted for?
    ```

      At the very least, this likely means that cryonics, in its current state, doesn't preserve a person, as those RNA fragments likely react differently to very cold temperatures than synaptic passages do.
      ```

    I’ve been having doubts about the feasibility, or at least practicality, of uploading since [I found out about the important role our intestinal microbes play in our psychology](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/75pnk3/d_wednesday_worldbuilding_thread/do85jly), so this just shows to me that we still have a long way to go before we understand how consciousness works and how to artificially (re)create it.
    ```

    - u/CreationBlues:
      ```
      That's actually slightly explicable, it turns out that a lot of neurotransmitters are manufactured by our microbiome, such as 90% of our bodies serotonin [(link)](http://www.caltech.edu/news/microbes-help-produce-serotonin-gut-46495). Of course, considering that some scientists have called the gut a second brain, and the interdependence of the cns and peripheral nervous system, the gut probably plays a large part in helping to regulate the brain.

      I do think that consciousness entirely resides in the brain, and everything else is just a support system for that, important as it is to healthiness and happiness.

  When I think of something to post, I often forget it, or forget to post, when the appropriate thread comes along, so nowadays I write the post up ahead of time and email it to myself (I have three chains, one each for Rationality, Worldbuilding, and Off-Topic). 

  Do you all write your posts the day that the thread appears, or do some of you write your posts out ahead of time or at least mark down that there's something that you want to mention?
  ```

  - u/MagicWeasel:

    it's funny you post this because I was thinking last night "oo I have some writing advice i want to ask for, I'll post it in the general rationality thread i guess because it's rational writing so i can get away with it", and I came on here to post it because I remembered I had something to post but I forgot what I actually wanted to post.

    So I think I'm going to have to start trying your strategy. 

    Sometimes if it's a day late I'll post it in the thread anyway; this reddit is small enough that my posts in that category do seem to get seen.
    ```

  - u/trekie140:

    For a while I did write my posts ahead of time, though I never set up reminders, but lately I haven’t been as engaged so I’ve just been joining the conversation whenever I remember to.
    ```

  - u/ToaKraka:
    ```
    If I plan to make a post, I typically write it up in Google Docs beforehand (on my computer, at home) and then copy-and-paste it into a Reddit comment on Friday (from my phone, before eating lunch at work). I also use [Google Keep](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.keep&hl=en) to remind myself to add a topic to the Google Doc in the evening.

    I don't post often, only about three times so far, and have always lucked out and had the thing I wanted to post on the day the thread was up.

    Point being, have you tried being luckier?

  So, they've announced [the winners of the first round of the AI Alignment Prize](https://www.lesserwrong.com/posts/4WbNGQMvuFtY3So7s/announcement-ai-alignment-prize-winners-and-next-round).  [One of them in particular](https://medium.com/@pwgen/friendly-ai-through-ontology-autogeneration-5d375bf85922) caught my eye as requiring snark in the form of a Facebook tag-group thingy, but I didn't want to snark too nastily in a real-name format, in case the person didn't Mean Anything By This.

  >Imagine a company called Autogenerated Fantasy Worlds Inc. They develop software that ingests books/movies/video games related to some fantasy world (Star Wars, Harry Potter, or even traditional gaming worlds like Legend of Zelda) and automatically generates a virtual reality MMORPG corresponding to that world. Instead of handcrafting dozens of digital words, the company only needs to refine a single ontology autogeneration software package. It doesn’t need to be perfect to begin with, as long as it saves labor over handcrafting. As players send in bug reports regarding inaccurate aspects of a world, the company’s profit incentive becomes aligned with solving the ontology autogeneration problem at maximum fidelity. NPC-related bug reports would be especially useful, since they would provide information about your ability to model a character’s values. Given the profit potential of this project, it might be possible to attract VC investment and use little philanthropist money.

  @sounds like your business plan would destroy the world if successful but ok

  Keep in mind, [last year](https://improbable.io) I had to sit through a presentation where someone basically proposed to build the Matrix, then protested that they didn't mean it in the *Matrix* or *Black Mirror* way, so I'm getting less surprised to see This Will Inevitably Go Wrong scifi cliches as serious ideas.

    I actually think it’s an interesting idea that could potentially teach AI how to create art, or at least RPG campaigns. I don’t see it as any more risky than any other optimization AI project, which I’m plenty concerned about for the near future economic and sociological impact, but side with Robin Hanson on which singularity scenario is more likely.

  What do ya'll think about shorting Bitcoin?

  Let's say it's a huge bubble; would short selling have an unusually large expected return, or would efficient market hypothesis and a lot of big investors also expecting a bubble counterbalance all of the cryptocurrency mania and leave the investment no better (and much riskier) than an index fund for an average investor?

  If not, how would an average person actually go about shorting a cryptocurrency?

    The current state of the market is irrational. The market, however, can stay irrational for longer than you can stay solvent.

    - u/blazinghand:
      ```
      This is the big issue. The best way to "short" Bitcoin at this stage is probably to liquidate your Bitcoin investments and invest into non-Bitcoin things.
      ```

  - u/Gurkenglas:
    ```
    You could buy the right to sell a bitcoin at or before a specified date at a specified price, also called a put option. Seems you can, for instance, buy a 6000$ put option for the 30th of march for about 300$, which would net you about 2700$ if the bitcoin price drops to 3000$ by then, and lose you 300$ if it stays above 6000$.

    [I think you should have done it.](http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/investing/260-billion-cryptocalypse-as-cryptos-plunge-30-per-cent-amid-fresh-china-south-korea-fears/news-story/3775fe60f78da3c9bd53cedf3ef0f23b)
    ```

  - u/electrace:
    ```
    The only time you should short something is if...

    1) You know something bad about the investment that no one else does.

    2) You have the credibility/evidence to prove it to people who have a ton of money.

    Otherwise, it makes much more sense to just sell what you have, and put your money somewhere else. 

    Right now, if you want to get into cryptocurrencies, but think Bitcoin isn't going to be the "currency of the future" then I'd suggest buying some Litecoin, Monero, and Ether. 

    Never buy with money that you can't afford to lose, especially with cryptocurrencies.

  >   I actually know of a memetic hazard that is sometimes capable of producing small amounts of pain that would not have been felt otherwise. No joke!  If you want to know it I can PM it to people.

  Of 23 infections here on reddit 3 people were affected with the extra pain. A couple natural carriers were found.  Note the following quote: 

   >extreme negative response - something akin to torture. The ensuing week - pretty shitty. 

  Luckily this user posted an update about a month later that no lasting damage was done.

    can you PM it to me as well? I'll edit my own comment within 1 week to update on any effects.

    Update as promised: I did not receive a PM.
