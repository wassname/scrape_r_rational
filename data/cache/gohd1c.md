## Creating collaborative docs/sheets for works in rarer media (manga, movies, etc)

### Post:

It's quite hard/inefficient to find recommendations for any media except written fiction on this subreddit. (E.g., anime. manga, movies, etc.) Do you guys think it would be a good idea to create a Google Docs or some similar online collab system for these media and put that in the weekly rec threads or the sidebars?

On a side note; If we could create a rating mechanism like IMDB things could potentially be better. IMDB's model is much more efficient than sifting through lots of recommendations, though the ease of "contributing" might dilute our niche. Can we emulate a rating system via Google Sheets?

\[Reposted from my comment on the current recommendation thread.\]

Update: Some kind soul created a wonderful [sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Qwg1e7iARJ4a4F3yNTPA-BiwqYo7j4KPcxE1Nz_D5u0) that works neatly. If any of the mods can be so kind to include this in the weekly recommendation threads, weâ€™ll be good to go!

  We sure can! On a separate sheet, we can do [something like this](https://i.imgur.com/8r9JTLW.png). (As you can see, we can even somewhat-proof it against weird scoring.) As long as nobody griefs the doc, this should work.

  Then, [we can use the score on another sheet](https://i.imgur.com/QGVi3oE.png) (for example, the main one, with recommendations).

  You could also set up a google form to take recommendations/rankings then populate the curated list from that
