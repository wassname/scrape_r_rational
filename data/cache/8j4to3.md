## [RT][HSF][HF][TH]Onward To Providence Episode V: Rolling Back and Looking otherwise

### Post:

I think this is probably on the longer end for one of my 'chapters' / 'episodes' also this is pretty close to finishing up on 'establishing' characters.

Next up we are going to be starting to get into a little bit of adventure. But that is for later.

Always appreciate feedback and discussion, even if it only amounts to yelling at me to fix my grammar/spelling!

  This is really fun! I liked your Deep Rise comic, especially the late game with the Royals forcing the protagonists into space, and this looks like it will be a continuation of the genre (if not the story). I love your mix of cute and horrific!
