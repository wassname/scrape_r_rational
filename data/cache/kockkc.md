## [D] Friday Open Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could (possibly) be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.

  How fucking weird is the movie Hancock? The guy carves a logo on the face of the moon visible from the earth, basically defaces it for all eternity ... And it's some kind of happy ending? Wtf?

  - u/DrMaridelMolotov:
    ```
    It's because it's literally two movies in one. Originally it was supposed to end really dark but studios didn't like that. Hence why the first half is really interesting. But yeah carving a stupid logo on the moon is such a trash ending.

    What looks uncanny about it, at least to me, is how balanced they are. Being that balanced while dancing solo jazz is a skill that take a lot of practice to learn, and is often eschewed in favor of styling. Seeing a dance with near perfect balance, where the limited flair is also balanced in is mildly unsettling. The choreography is fun though.

      To me I think it's the lack of "momentum" -- the robots' movements have very high jerk, and coupled with their high precision, deviate quite a bit from human dancers' more swoopy, swaying, smoothly accelerating movements.
      ```

      - u/RetardedWabbit:

        Both of these explainations are good: unnatural balance and jerky/precise movements. Humans naturally move their center of balance around much more and usually value smooth movement, but they're never perfect. I think the balance is the most unerving, they don't move through unbalanced phases like we do all the time.

        I couldn't stop thinking about the poor souls who had to put in a huge amount of work to make a robot dance video. I doubt that was in their job description.

  Just watched the show "Queen's Gambit" these last couple weeks, which I quite enjoyed! All about a young woman struggling to rise to the top of the competitive chess world while struggling with interpersonal relationships and substance abuse problems. Especially liked the (rare, for Western media) positive portrayal of Russian people and culture -- the Americans were all alcoholics in this one, for a change! lol


  ~***Minor Spoilers Below***~

  One thing that struck me, though, that doesn't seem to be a very popular topic of discussion on the /r/queensgambit subreddit, is how devoting one's life and talents to playing children's ~~card~~ board games is always seen as a worthwhile way to spend one's time, relative to, say, working in pure maths or physics research, or some other "productive intellectual pursuit". Beth Harmon in the first episode is shown to effortlessly excel in school, especially in more theoretical subjects (i.e. math), and takes to chess initially after trivially acing some academic test in demonstrable mismatch between her abilities and those of her peers. Her failure to become the next Turing or Euler or whoever is not shown as a tragedy -- indeed, it's never remarked upon at all. Except maybe in how her mother's mental illness led her to attempt murder-suicide, instead of capitalizing upon whatever talents enabled her to achieve a Math PhD from Cornell, and also when Beth is shown to ask another chess player what his intentions are after becoming King of Games.

  Anyone feel the same? (I remember participating in a similar discussion on this subject 5-10 years ago here -- iirc, it was in reference to the Paul Murphy quote "The ability to play chess is the sign of a gentleman. The ability to play chess well is the sign of a wasted life." Curious if sentiment's changed since). Is playing chess not actually a squandering of one's talents, in the same way that, say, playing Starcraft is? (obviously a life you enjoy is a life well-lived blah blah blah you know what I mean). At least when Lex Luthor [plays exhibition matches](https://i.imgur.com/Mg4w7uA.jpeg) he only does so in between other useful things, like plotting world domination or something. And would chess prodigies even make math or science prodigies, otherwise? It sounds like ["cognitive ability" underpins](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0160289616301593) both, but is the relationship tightly coupled enough that any given individual would find themselves in both tails with sufficiently high probability? Am I too far up my own asshole? What do y'all think?
  ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    I think in *Queen's Gambit*, and in other works, a lot of what underpins the narrative is the joy of playing the game, and the emergent beauty that it sometimes has. *Queen's Gambit* doesn't go very far into actual chess, seeing as actually explaining tactics to a layman is quite hard, especially without having enough room to breathe, but I think you do get the sense of it as that to the people involved. There's joy in clean, precise lines of play, or brilliant insights, and the fact that it's ultimately meaningless expect as a matter of competition is kind of immaterial.

    Pure mathematics has some of that too, but it's harder to show on the screen, and perhaps less easy to identify with. Playing games is easy to identify with, because it's something that almost everyone has done, and some of the "deeper" feelings are accessible even to novices. I'm not good at chess (rated like 900), but I still get that nice feeling of accomplishment when something falls into place.

    And yes, I would agree that this is in some sense "wasteful". Especially with chess, all you leave behind are games that you played, recorded for posterity, and it's not quite like a different pursuit where people can build off of it, or take their own joy in consuming and integrating what you've made. (This isn't *quite* true, because high-level chess players learn a lot from old games, and chess theory develops, and there *is* joy to be had from replaying and analyzing exceptional games, but IMO this pales in comparison to the utility of something like an old painting or an old book.)

    I guess I would caution against going too far into utilitarian calculation that doesn't take into account the utilitarian benefits of play, and of the happiness that can be had from watching and enjoying high-level experts at fields that are specifically selected for being stimulating in particular ways that *aren't* necessarily "helpful" to anyone in a more concrete way. It's just harder to evaluate the utility.

      I do this with video games. I've put in a whole bunch of hours into Divinity: Original Sin 1 and 2, and have yet to complete either even once.  I enjoy tinkering around with party composition, figuring out which spells and skills work in what combinations.

      I spend a lot of time optimizing things, probably too much.

    Humans are hardwired to compete for status. Once the basic necessities are cared for, chess and other games are a good way to satisfy that demand. Of course we aren't yet at that point as a society, so until then it is not a productive avenue.

    I've heard of Queen's Gambit, wasn't convinced and still not quite convinced it's worth watching, despite I'm a longtime chess player, good enough that I could make a living off of it and become an FM. 

    It struck me as woke-bait and I anticipated that it'd probably be mediocre while still hitting a handful of milestones meant for broad appeal. There's not much profit in portraying chess or competitive chess authentically or at least without a lot of extraneous content. 

    Bits and pieces of what I've heard about it suggest I may have underestimated it a bit, but despite having a passion for chess, I have little desire to watch it and a broad disgust with being associated with Netflix, even in spirit. 

    Answering what you brought up, your average chess prodigy is a combination of someone who was immersed in the chess world from an early age and someone who is a savant in a handful of cognitive skills that lend very well to chess.

    Professional chess is psychologically draining both on and off the board. The people who can withstand the stress enough to make it a career are often either twisted enough on some level that the world of chess is one of the only places they can thrive, so they go all in, or are all-around ordered enough individuals that they can see a bigger picture while still having the self-mastery to be successful. I consider myself in the latter category.

    I'm not a savant or the result of someone pushed into the sport. Chess was a side hobby before I decided it was what I wanted to do as a job to provide the revenue to do other things I enjoy doing. That doesn't mean I don't like chess a lot, but I'm not a prodigy and it's not my life.

    I suspect that I'd have done a lot more if I made chess into an end unto itself. I suspect I could've contributed to the world even more if I pursued something in STEM. I'm self-taught in mathematics and various other fields enough that I can read works about them at roughly postgraduate levels. That being said my goal was never to fit into the world in that way. That's a whole different rant on its own, but the contributions I chose to make are more abstract.

    That's an awesome shade of purple. I'd love it if us men looked good in colorful stuff like that. If we did I'd rock it all the time. Emerald, this purple, and some other shades look so cool.  Sadly it's really hard to pull off.

        There's also the fact that clothes are in general designed and made for fit people with good posture, not necessarily to average people. Which means most clothes don't look as good as they do in pictures from models as they do when we buy them.

        I agree in principle, but in practice what I'd want probably doesn't exist, and reasonably many people can't exactly afford to be their own stylists and then get tailor-made clothes. I like men's cuts for clothes, I'd just enjoy if they weren't almost all so drab in color choices.

        I'm less worried about the social judgement aspect. I've got the marked impression that in many circumstances you could push the envelope quite a bit as long as you're distinctly confident while doing it. People will either be too embarrassed, too polite or too stunned to say anything to your face, and the Emperor's New Clothing effect will benefit you. After a while, if you're not a pain in the butt for them for more practical reason, it'll likely just become filed as a quirk of yours, and it might if anything benefit you as you are now visually very distinctive and jump to people's mind more easily and draw their attention more.

  It seems that the, "official" longest pieces of English literature by word count are fanfiction. [*The Loud House Revamped*](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12715870/1/The-Loud-House-Revamped) is ongoing, has been around for more than two years, and currently stands at over 7.8 million words surpassing both [*Ambience: A Fleet Symphony*](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10333897) (4.5 million) and [*The Subspace Emissary's Worlds Conquest*](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4112682/1/The_Subspace_Emissarys_Worlds_Conquest) (4.1 million) by a wide margin. 

  For comparison, Worm is 1.6 mill. words, the Harry Potter series is 1.08 mill., HPMOR is 0.66 mill. 

  This would of course be excluding works which are nonsense, extremely obscure, blatantly just meant to be record-setters, and/or don't really count as a single work. 

  Some would demand that the standards be stricter, excluding serials, demanding that included stories be published by standards closer to the mainstream, etc.

  I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to reading. At the same time, I burn through books very quickly, even when not on lockdown. One of my favorite series is *A Chronicle of Ancient Sunlight* by Henry Williamson whose most known trait is its length (2.6 mill). Girth aside, it's not something that has broad appeal to a contemporary audience, even to rationalists, but I'd recommend it if you're interested in the early 20th century.

  I haven't read any of the above mentioned fanfic aside from HPMOR, but I do end up reading a lot of it and other webfiction that floats above Sturgeon's Law to fulfill the potential that more mainstream media doesn't have the time, ability, or willingness to fulfill.

  I often wonder about the truly niche series that exist, even more niche than genre-bending fanfic.

  Sorry, this rambles a bit...

  After zipping through [The Shadow of Angmar](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11115934/1/The-Shadow-of-Angmar) (Harry Potter is transported to Tolkein's Middle Earth), I think I'd like to live like the Elves.

  Well, not exactly as an Elf or in Middle Earth, but more in tune with the environment and nature as they are.  I've read LotR and such before, but it for whatever reason, really sunk in to me reading that fanfic just how appealing their lifestyle would be for me.

  If we do see some sort of Rapture of the Nerds or otherwise solve some pressing problems with the environment and mortality, I'd probably choose to stay human for a while if that is feasible.

  I'm envisioning an alternate version of the 20th century America. There's no plastic packaging and the disposable consumer lifestyle, everything is (or at least can be) recycled.  Lots of towns and small cities that are more attuned to their environment.  Walkable downtown areas that don't allow cars.  Not on the level of Lothlorien, but more trees and a garden-like environ outside of the core. There's enough non-animal sources of complete protein that there is no need for factory farms, everyone is gladly vegan.

  People living a long, long time, and developing their own skills and crafts and art.

  I suppose I could deal with the occasional orc and goblin incursions, but I'd rather not see the long-term withering of lightness and culture by a formless and implacable evil like Morgoth or Sauron.  Even with their defeat, the Forth Age of Middle Earth sounds fairly... meh.

  Elves, The Culture, or something else... what would be your idyllic living look like?
  ```

  - u/--MCMC--:
    ```
    I liked how The Shadow of Angmar started, but it sort of lost me after a half dozen chapters. Would you recommend trying it again? 

    In terms of fictional universes, I think I'd much rather be a citizen of the Culture than of some elven realm of Middle-earth  -- if anything, the latter can be produced by the former if you ask a Mind nicely.

    In the real world...I do like outdoorsy stuff (mostly walking), as well as more city-based flânerie, but I also like goofing around with computer-y stuff and hermithood. I think my ideal house would be if you modernized fallingwater's interior, transplanted it to the base of some waterfall in the Lauterbrunnen Valley, and put in high-speed rail to Zurich, while incidentally also transplanting Tokyo's downtown into one of its corner's. Alternatively, take [this house](https://www.telluriderealestatecorp.com/listing/38274/341-royer-lane-telluride-co-81435/?fbclid=IwAR2C62-7NmFEgTGLfR1O7Uuwc2mx56qHvkD0Ys1T_r4ruF7surDVEedoNWU) and chuck it into the mountains north of Vancouver, BC. 

    In this scenario I'd ofc be independently wealthy, and a small fleet of robots would take care of all household chores. Each morning I would wake up and (after consulting my partner over morning lattes, we'd) choose to either tend to personal (science / programming / altruistic) projects, or go on a long walk in the surrounding forests and hills. Once a week we'd invite a few friends over to play games and have fun conversations.

      I think it has been interesting so far.  One of the major sticking points finally gets resolved a bit further in.  Though at great cost.

      Yeah, I'd still want some high tech, but not the disposable culture that currently surrounds it.  Living near the mountains, with access to some city life would be grand.

      Even in a high-tech, post-scarcity society, there's still plenty that is interesting out there.  Like dark matter / energy, the possibilities with alien life, etc.  I'd enjoy having enough time to study those sorts of things.

    It has a lot appeal because it's what we evolved to like. We didn't evolve to live in cities where most people are lonely while surrounded by people.

    &#x200B;

    We evolved to live in tightly knit groups of family and friends, who work with us but just enough work to maintain ourselves and our families rather than to stockpile. To travel and explore new places, share excess food with others because there's no refrigeration and that's technically food preservation because it means when we're hungry other will be more likely to share their food with us etc.

    &#x200B;

    There's a lot of appeal to that way of life, it's technically heaven, specially if you remove the bad parts like disease, suffering and all. 

    &#x200B;

    (Just started on Heaven's River the new bobiverse book and so far a specie of alien seems to have chosen that scenario for themselves even though they possessed advanced tech).

      I mean, it's the kind of test where you need to answer sincerely... supposedly. I think that's more of a problem that would arise with any sort of test (potentially even a psychological examination by an expert): repeat it long enough, you learn how to game it. The Forer effect thing is a separate issue IMO, even if the test was legit it probably is more of a function of not wanting to give anyone a personality description that reads like "yeah, you're probably a self-absorbed, heartless psychopath, do humanity a favor and kill yourself".

    Any work that is written with every character using a roughly identical frame of reference are unrealistic.

    Peer pressure, for example.

    It can make people behave illogically in some sense. (Asch conformity experiments).

    Rational fiction means treating people as having inner motives and thoughts.

    Is it a good idea to be the first in line for a vaccine that was rushed?  "I don't know, but I don't trust the people on TV who hate people like me, so I'll sit it out."
    "Everything I do is posturing in order to jockey for social position, and my vocal responses to the events of the last year reflects that".

    People can be a lot more interesting if you let them be.  They're all running different heuristics under bounded rationality, and a large part of what I enjoy in those pieces of rational fiction I've liked is the juxtaposition of the ways different people reason, even if they don't do it explicitly.

    Hey, did you know? People are different from each other. Some behave more rationally than others.
