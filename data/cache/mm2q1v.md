## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding and Writing Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*
* Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is *also* the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday Recommendation thead)

  Hello everyone, first post here. I've dabbled in the fiction before, read a few of the major stories, like Yudkowsky's stuff and some of its derivatives (e.g. *Friendship is Optimal*), then *Worm*, *The Metropolitan Man*, a few others. Big fan of the first Bobiverse novel, that sort of thing. I got into it a few years ago, dropped it for a while, but I've just now finished *Thinking, Fast and Slow*, and it piqued my interest again. I've got *The Black Swan* and Toby Ord's *The Precipice* on my reading list again now, and I'm tackling *Luminosity*, which I didn't read in my first go around because I didn't know as much about Twilight as I did HP.

  I've decided to try my hand at a bit of rationalist fiction myself, and this seemed to be the appropriate thread to ask this question and gather some thoughts about my premise:

  What are the usual pitfalls of first-time writers in the genre, especially with my background of introduction-by-way-of-HPMOR? I assume there are some clichÃ©s that would be easy to fall into.

  And more generally, what do you all think of this idea?

  **Synopsis**

  Modern day Earth is exposed to a brand-new outside context problem, and the story is intended as an exploration of different responses to it. A wave of mysterious energy moving at light speed engulfs the Earth without warning, causing around 1 / 10,000 people on the planet to develop reality-warping abilities. At first, these are believed to be unique superpowers ala Worm, but it soon becomes obvious that it is more like a hard magic system, and anything one of them can do, the others can learn to do as well with time and practice. The powers you start with are completely random, and for everyone except the protagonist, I've created a dice system to determine these.

  The magic system is divided into nine Spheres or general categories, inspired in part by Mage: the Ascension, except that they are not equal in required effort: the more impossible the effect is under the original laws of reality, the more magical energy is required to produce the effect. There are other rules, but this is the big one. It makes some dangerous large-scale magic much less accessible (messing with time and causality, for example), but it makes neurological and biological magic the *most* accessible, opening up the door to abuse and dramatic, villainous acts.

  With the potential for a magic system like this to spiral out of control and ruin the planet, I decided to have the story begin right at the first exposure. This way, doing the necessary research to understand and control this power is something that needs to be done *right now*, to protect the world from completely falling apart. That seemed appropriate to the genre.

  Follows two primary characters, at least at first:

  **Protagonist** | rationalist grad student Ash Ridley, who is granted access to the mysterious powers by pure chance as part of the original wave; her big starting power is to make other people into mages, along with some neurological magic like framejacking and mnemonics, which give her an interesting point of view to write in. 

  Essentially an ordinary person thrust into an extraordinary situation, Ash rapidly becomes one of the United States' foremost experts on magic, a position she was absolutely not prepared to fill. In over her head, trying to help the most people possible, dealing with the highest levels of government and the machinations of her fellow mages both within the country and without, Ash has to leverage every scrap of rationality she can muster just to survive.

  **Deuteragonist** | hedonist, psychedelic artist, musician and mystic Phoenix Brown, who is accidentally granted powers by Ash directly after she got her own powers. Ash's dirt-broke roommate, ex-girlfriend and part-time lover, she provides an alternative mode of thought that usually conflicts heavily with the more logical Ash. Her starting powers are related to alternative realities and biology. Has her own point of view that alternates with Ash.

  **Saving the world with portals.**  


  Scenario: a random individual gains an ability to make pairs of  circular portals. The portals can be any size, as long as they are either placed on a flat surface or within a ring-shaped frame,  


  How can this ability be used to uplift mankind, and spread it all over the universe? Bring about clean energy? End scarcity? Terraform planets? Extend human lifespan? etc  


  Some rules:  


  \- the portals can be any size

  \- the portals themselves are indestructible, but the surface underneath them/frame is not

  \- closing a portal on an object cuts the object perfectly, making a perfectly flat surface.

  \- the portals let anything through: matter radiation, gravity waves etc

  \- portals adjust to "flatten" imperfect surfaces they are placed on, but only by about 5%. If the surface/frame is more crooked, the portals fails to latch.

  \- the portals persist forever unless closed personally by their maker, or the surface they are placed on is damaged (more than 2% misaligned with the perfectly flat portal)

  \- the "back" of the portal leads to the "back" of the other, each pair can be used in two ways.

  \- portals can be transported through another portal with no issues.

  \- transporting portal through its twin superimposes the matter between them on itself, leading to exotic matter with >2x the density. Or KABOOM, whichever makes more sense in the context.

  \- the travel time between portals is "instantaneous" (for physics sake, it is equal to light travelling 1 nm in vacuum) regardless of how distant the portals are.

  \- the Portal Man can make portals on any surface he sees, saw in the past and still remembers (provided it still exists) or saw on a picture/video/drawing/schematic that corresponds to a real object.

  \- the Portal Man himself is otherwise an ordinary 30 yo guy with no particular smarts or knowledge, except an insane desire to save and uplift humanity, and is likely to be pragmatic/utilitarian in his approach.

  \- It is not know at first how he makes the portals, and whether they will persist after his death.

    The first three obvious things that come to mind are long-distance transportation, unlimited clean energy, and trivially easy space expansion / colonization.

    Transportation: pretty obvious, build a giant "train" station and then the trains go through portals, plenty of details to work through but there are people who do that kind of thing for a living.

    Energy: Dynamos, delicious delicious dynamos.

    Space: Here is a picture of Mars! Here is a picture of the Moon! Here is a picture of a flat piece of the outside of the ISS! Now we have three portals!

    Really the only hard part is finding someone with enough political, social, and/or economic clout to make sure the dude isn't kidnapped/assassinated and also is taken seriously and given the logistical backing needed to do stuff. If Portal Man can survive the first six months of being publicly active, everything should be fine.

    Space travel becomes vastly easier, every planet and asteroid we have a photo of is a mere portal away. Need resources? make a portal to the asteroid belt. Need energy? make a portal next to the sun.

    >closing a portal on an object cuts the object perfectly, making a perfectly flat surface

    How does this work at the quantum level? are atoms cut in half, releasing a lot of radiation? That would make portal not safe anywhere on earth.

    Apart from studying how they are made, I don't see how the portal can help scientific discovery, beyond the obvious application in astronomy.

      >How does this work at the quantum level? are atoms cut in half, releasing a lot of radiation? That would make portal not safe anywhere on earth.

      I'd assume it wouldn't hit that many atoms? How many atoms would be on the path of the cutting plane, which is probably sth like plank length thin? Individual atoms splitting don't create *that* much energy; nuclear energy's powerfulness is based on chain reactions so that *large* amounts of atoms break.

      - u/Norseman2:
        ```
        Agreed. I calculated it out of academic curiosity, and found that it would be equal to about one [banana equivalent dose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana_equivalent_dose).

        Let's say we're closing a 2m radius portal on a massive cast iron beam to cut it in half. An Fe-56 nucleus is about 10 fm in diameter, so the split would occur within a cylinder which is 2m in radius and 10 fm long, or about 1.25 * 10^-8 mL in volume.

        Iron has a density of 7.874 g/cm^3, so we'd be dealing with 9.84 * 10^-8 grams of iron which gets split. Iron has a molar mass of 55.845 g/mol, so this works out to about 0.141 * 10^-9 moles of iron, or a total of about 8.49 * 10^13 iron nuclei which get split.

        A common scenario would probably be that an Fe-56 nucleus gets split exactly in half, producing two Al-28 nuclei which end up at opposite sides. Al-28 has a half-life of 2.2 minutes and undergoes Î²^â decay, emitting an electron with 2.865 MeV of kinetic energy, plus a gamma ray with 1.782 MeV of energy [[Ref](https://journals.aps.org/pr/abstract/10.1103/PhysRev.86.165)], resulting in Si-28 which is stable. Assuming all 8.49 * 10^13 iron nuclei undergo the same or comparable decay processes, the exposure for someone who hugs the cut edge for several minutes after the cut would likely be on the order of 1 * 10^-5 J, or close to 1 * 10^-7 Sv for a 100 kg person, which would be about one banana equivalent dose.

      Iâm not positive it helps with space travel that much. We donât have good photos (ie ones with a flat surface) of all the planets in our solar system, let alone anything outside the solar system. I donât see why a portal to the sun would work. 

      It would definitely provide a leg up though.
      ```

      - u/SpaceTimeOverGod:
        ```
        The portal man can make portal on any surface he saw on a drawing/schematic that corresponds to a real object.

        Therefore, there is no need for high quality photos, you can take a drawing where there is a flat surface, and as long as there is a flat surface on the planet or satellite, you can place a portal there.
        ```

        - u/plutonicHumanoid:
          ```
          If this was a prompt I made I wouldnât count that, it feels like a conceptual stretch from the intention of someone drawing a place that they know with certainty exists (and are correct about), with sufficient detail as to be generally unambiguous. Which remains nebulous, but still.

          If you were able to do that, it would imply that intention is far more important than accuracy in using an image, which might mean you could draw places that may only theoretically exist to travel to. Thatâs an interesting idea, but seems different from the intention of the prompt.
          ```

          - u/SpaceTimeOverGod:
            ```
            Youâre right, itâs a bit of a stretch.
             Another way would be to open portals on the space probes we already sent, which would reduce the cost of space launch to basically nothing.
            ```

    - Build a spaceship

     - Build a large tube around it

     - Pump the air out of it (could use portal linked with one in space to do well, just put it inside the tube (probably should be hermetically sealed beforehand so it doesn't annoyingly 'vent' the air all the time while being transported on the Earth)

     - Activate portals at both ends of the tube, put the one used to vent the atmosphere 'behind' one of them so it's not in the way.

     - Tilt the whole tube 90 degrees so the spaceship starts falling

     - It'll continually accelerate at 1G, going through the tube on a loop

     - Wait about one year 'till it accelerates to ~c

     - [Don't fuck up the timing] transport the portal which has a portal used for making the vacuum behind him through said vacuum-portal (which has a pair in space). Move it very very swiftly out of the way.

     - Hopefully exit of the portal in space pointed *away* from Earth, not towards it. If so, we have a pretty darn fast spaceship traveling somewhere. Hopefully there is some matching portal onboard.

    IDK how it'd interact with relativity stuff through.


    ---

    Clean energy is trivial, just put one portal above the other and 'pump' water or such. Hit the turbine on the way. Or put a portal near the sun (but maybe not too near?), warm up the water on the other side. 'gravity leaking through the portal' might be a problem through?
    ```

  - u/ArmokGoB:
    ```
    I think I must be misunderstanding this somehow. All of these are trivial, almost automatic, with how OP the power is, no need for any intelligence or munchkining. Possibly except for the ageing, but you can solve *most* of it by stationing people near the supermassive black hole so they're frozen in time until medicine progresses enough. 

    The one non-obvious thing you might want to do is put up a small offworld research outpost to work on friendly AI, and then move the earth with everyone else near the black hole so other AI efforts or politics can't interfere.

      There's a small complication of 'gravity leaking through it', through. I'm not sure how it'd really work out. Also, relativity is broken by this I'd assume, so  who knows how time dilation works anymore(?)
      ```

      - u/plutonicHumanoid:
        ```
        Yeah, if time dilation and all that implies still exists I think you can go back in time with this.

        Edit: I donât have the math background for this but [this](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tachyonic_antitelephone) at least shows that it should be trivial to (if not impossible not to) send information back in time with this.

    Ignoring the violation of causality that would allow for lots of crazy stuff and/or destroy the universe.

    Regular transportation to and from nearly everywhere on Earth is easy and helpful. Politically difficult though. Although, Portal Man could do it without anyone knowing or consenting. Just go on Google Maps and spam portals. Low-tech solution would be flipping through National Geographic and newspapers.

    In terms of traveling the universe weâre limited to (solid, I assume) objects that have a flat surface that we have a visual of (assuming that making a drawing of a place thatâs real but no one has knowledge of doesnât work). I think this actually makes it pretty difficult to leave the solar system, as the amount of pictures of exoplanets we have is very small, and they look like [this](https://blog.nationalgeographic.org/2014/05/12/best-photo-yet-of-an-exoplanet/), so thatâs a no-go. We could use [probes that have exited the solar system](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_artificial_objects_leaving_the_Solar_System) to get to interstellar space, if we wanted to be there for some reason. Getting to planets in our solar system is much easier, we could get to Mars and Venus immediately because of probes weâve landed, the probes have flat surfaces and may have pictures of flat surfaces as well. Maybe some moons too, Iâm not sure what objects we have enough clear pictures of that thereâs a usable flat region. This is assuming that Portal Man canât just look at a picture of an entire region and try to make small portals in different areas without knowing if theyâre flat. 

    If it works on objects that may or may not exist that would help, because we could possibly get to Jupiter and Saturn that way, through the remains of probes that have been discarded (Galileo and Cassini). Feels like a bit of an edge case.

    All this space travel requires infrastructure though, especially if you want to do more than just make the portal.

    Step 1: Have two ring-shaped metal portal-frames

    Step 2: Create a portal connecting them to one another

    Step 3: Take a curved metal bar and put in the portal.

    Step 4: weld together each end of the curved metal bar to each portal frame

    You have just created macroscopic entanglement.
