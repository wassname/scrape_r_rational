  >Juniper is a lever by which the world can be moved.

  That was clever. I think the best part about this is how not all of the agency is centered around the main character - he involves others in his plans, and not just as pawns. The continual growth of genuine trust is really interesting to see. Also, "hooman".

  Ch 16 is up now, I am out of town until Sunday for family stuff so 17 may be a longer wait (though I have no update schedule for anyone to hold me to).

    Hey, just binged through the story today after seeing the posts here so often. Just wanted to let you know that I was pleasantly surprised by your work, and I'm looking forward to the future chapters.

    Still loving it -- quick question though. Why did Juniper learn skin magic after receiving the Fool's Collar, but not bone magic after being healed?
    ```

    - u/cthulhuraejepsen:
      ```
      Fool's Collar ties itself into the skin of the victim, as does most tattoo magic that moves from one person to another. In other words, it's using *your own skin* and if you're paying close enough attention, you can feel it there.

      Conversely, all Juniper is feeling from the bone magic is its effect, not the root of the magic. You wouldn't get a first inkling of gem magic by getting blasted in the face by a laser, nor would you get an inkling of what blood magic was about if someone used Aarde's Touch to burn you on the arm.

      (Someone *could* awaken your awareness of the magic in your blood through certain blood magic techniques, but it would be through a conmingling of blood. Someone could also awaken your awareness of the magic in your bones by, for example, sucking the power from one of them while it was still in your body.

      For most people that new awareness wouldn't be terribly helpful, since the awareness doesn't do anything without study and training, which needs direction and a lot of time if you want to gain power in an effective way.)

  I really like where you're going with all this!

  I do feel like I preferred when the flashbacks to the gaming table were spread out; interleaved with the story. It took me a bit to figure it out, but it created this nice impression where the MC's mind is wandering off onto relevant things during the plot downtime. Like; "while all this is going on, this is what's on his mind."

  I don’t get the 11/27 reference. Google only gives me math questions, so it’s a reference to a typical question in math class?

  Hm… I suspect this is not really relevant, but *if* Joon’s level-up provides him with the equivalent of a good night’s sleep, then by now his sleeping schedule should be rather screwy. I mean, a big part of the schedule is determined by day length and colouration of the daylight (statistically, you fall easier asleep after a dusk spectrum than a noon spectrum), but you can’t neglect the pure length of the day. Just consider it akin to waking up at the hour of Joon’s level up. I can’t talk about your experiences, but I know I’d have trouble falling asleep after at midnight when I woke up, fully rested, at noon or just after, to give an example.

  Of course in this case he was more or less shot just after ‘waking up’, so to speak, and the rest was well-needed.

    'If I had to put a number on it' is a common expression. With the 11/27 rather than something normal like a rating out of 10, the joke is that he's not putting a number on it as in the idiom where you make an estimate, he's reading the number for it on his health bar. It's a joke they don't get since only he can see the numbers.

      I didn’t make that connection. 

      Thank you for explaining this to me.

      Oh neat there's still time left to upvote and thank you both for bringing it up and explaining it. /u/Laborbuch
