## [D] Achron - Time travel RTS

### Post:

Strictly speaking this isn't rational, but after playing this game I came out with the impression that the time travel mechanics could interest more people here.

Description from wikipedia: 
>Achron is considered to be the first "meta-time strategy game" (Real-time strategy with time travel), notable for being the first game with free-form multiplayer time travel and its subtle handling of temporal paradoxes such as the grandfather paradox. Achron was released on August 29, 2011."

Basically its an RTS with general mechanics similar to star/warcraft on top of which players are able to skip backwards and forwards in time(-5 minutes, +1 minute), watch what happens, and can issue commands at those different times.
Moreover there are devices in the game that enable sending units through time.

The game has a mechanic where time propagate in waves that move about 3~ times faster than real time, and has interesting handling for paradoxes 
Again taken from wikipedia :
>chronoporting may lead to the grandfather paradox. In order to solve this, the game's engine automatically switches between the two possible outcomes. For instance, if a tank travels to the past and destroys the factory that created it, the tank survives and the factory is destroyed with the passing of a time-wave, vice versa with the passing of another, and so on until one outcome falls out of the boundaries of the timeline and the other becomes the absolute outcome

Getting on board of the game takes some time, and only after a while do you start internalizing your implications and adjusting your strategies, for example one time I was about to go on an assult on an enemy base and i realized I had some resources I could have built more units out of, but then I realized this is a time travel game, so I went 3 minutes back in time and clicked that button. And voila I now had those extra units back at the present(well actually it was a bit more complicated than that because I needed to wait for a time wave, but nvm that).
But this is part of what makes it so fun, its not the same RTS elements everyone are used to, this has an entire new dimension(well, literally :P) so the possibilities are really interesting to explore.

Anyhow I think internalizing time travel like this has a lot of benefits for intuitively working with stories so I figure it might interest some of you as well.

Do any of you play this game? how about trying to set up some games? the online community of this game is currently non-existant as far as I can tell, but we could always start something here...

  I remember following this as it came out. The concept was awesome but sadly they skimped on all the normal RTS things. If not for the time travel it would look like a bad copy of the original StarCraft. In fact a lot of the game looks more like a proof of concept prototype than like anything that's supposed to stand on it's own and make revenue. Would be cool if someone took the time travel engine to make an actually good game with it.

    Anything in particular they skimped on?
    I heard some complaints about the path-finding but I understand this was resolved a bit after the release.
    Other than that I didn't notice anything obviously broken so far.

      "Tutorial". They do a bad job of teaching how to work with the novel new mechanic. Think about how hard later puzzles in Portal would be if you hadn't learned concepts in easier puzzles.

        Are you referring to the tutorial/demo level they provide to introduce the mechanic?
        If so I agree its not the best , nor most comprehensive, but you do have to grant that time travel is not an easy topic to explain either..

        In any case that mostly effects how easy it is to get in, after you are in it doesn't really effect the experience anyway..

      The alien races are bland and forgettable, the various unit models don't do much to differentiate, the story is told in a horribly slow fashion that reminds me of games older than the original Command and Conquer, the graphics were at least 10 years out of date for the time and the actual unit control is clunky compared to modern RTS games.

      That's all off the top of my head from when I played it ~5 years ago but the Let's Play I just watched seems to confirm it.

  Man, the time travel mechanic on this game is absolutely the best thing about it. I wish there were more games that used this mechanic. I heard the game developers had to sacrifice a lot in order to make it work. But I know it's possible to do it better. Look at planetary annihilation and their chronocam technology. I would bet money on that being easily adapted to implement this game mechanic more efficiently. 

  I'm down for a game though.

  I'd be up for some games some time.

  I found it to be a really interesting game that was unfortunately way overambitious. On release the pathfinding was atrocious and it's been improved to merely 'bad' (like, starcraft 1 dragoon level bad).  The campaign was slow and didn't explain the time travel mechanics very well. The graphics especially were problematic, as it was often hard to distinguish between some units.

  The biggest problem was definitely the pathfinding though. You only get one release, and on release the pathfinding was so bad that it was unplayable. After the patches it became playable, but it was too late.
