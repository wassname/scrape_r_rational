## JJBA - Finger Consistency

### Post:

About a year ago, JJBA - Finger Consistency, a JoJo's Bizarre Adventure ratfic, was posted here. Looking back at the [associated post](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://amp.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/ddkiu0/rt_ff_wip_jojos_bizarre_adventure_finger/&ved=2ahUKEwjYis6wlNzwAhVMGFkFHR7HDlsQFjADegQICBAC&usg=AOvVaw3qH6pJ6wPOer84ZQ8vk8SE&cshid=1621648070521), it looks like the author, FattyUmpire, removed the work from AO3. It is not available in the Wayback Machine, and the author has been unresponsive to DMs.

Anyone have a static copy sitting around somewhere? IIRC it was pretty dope, seems like a shame for it to just no longer exist on this mortal coil.

  Ha! I remember this! And looking at that post, I even commented.

  Unfortunately, I don't really have my r/DataHoarder shit together. So I'm sorry I can't really help with this.

  This does highlight how much we need a JJBA ratfic though. That said, there really was barely anything there, that I can remember anyway. So, sad to say it, it wasn't as big of a loss as it could've been, though it was a neat intro. In that I can remember, anyway.

    OP (1) didn’t define what JJBA stands for, and (2) asked for help viewing a work whose author appears to have done everything possible to make it unviewable. Not a downvoter myself but, like, I get the impulse
