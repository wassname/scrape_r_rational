  I really liked the steel vulcan in the authors notes on [this comic](http://leftoversoup.com/archive.php?num=201)

  The author refers to previous work.  What/where is it?

  I am a fan. He talks about a lot of interesting philosophical stuff, while still telling jokes. Which are, almost always, still even funny! 

  The most thought-provoking was probably the short [gay/homosexual distinction rant](http://leftoversoup.com/archive.php?num=278).

  On the other hand, the compressed timescale is somewhat ridiculous. It's been about a month or two in-world since the beginning.
