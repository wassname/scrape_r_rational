## Secret Krampus Prompt Voting

### Post:

Welcome to the prompt voting thread for the Secret Krampus contest! 

I'll be posting each prompt as a top-level comment. The contest will run until 11:59PM next Sunday, or technically until whenever the thread comes out of contest mode after that. Whichever prompt has the most upvotes at that time wins, and I will gift the winning prompter Reddit platinum. You can upvote as many prompts as you want, including your own (but only with one account, please!).

I ask that people don't post other top-level comments so that the focus stays on the contest entries, but feel free to reply to the prompts with your thoughts and questions. You may want to ping the prompter in these, since they won't be notified otherwise.

Only folks who submitted [a story](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/jduvv6/secret_krampus_story_voting/) will have their prompt included in this thread. There will likely be some prompts that didn't get a story written for them, or stories whose prompts aren't in this thread. I'll add any late entries to both threads as they arrive, so be sure to check back later in the week for more prompts!

    There are a lot of really good prompts in here, but I want to single /u/eniteris's for being extremely *my jam*. I'd like to read a big sweeping well-thought take on what this world looks like. I'd also like to read a fluffier town-of-the-week version of this world that hopefully updates faster.

    This is delightful, /u/Ozryela, I hope I get to read a take or three on it at some point.

  /u/Kishoto: "You have died. You remember what felt like the inescapable pull of slumber; a much more final pull than a simple good night's sleep. You know that you are dead.

  "Death, however, is not what you expected. It's not the empty void you'd always thought. It was a void that contained two things; you and something else. Something that you could practically feel smiling at you, as if it was in on a joke that it couldn't wait to let you in on.

  "The thing tells you that you were wrong. That atheism is a crock, albeit a well thought out one, and that it is, in fact, a deity. THE deity. The one that made what you once called existence. And now it's time to figure out where you're ending up for the rest of yours."

  ```

- u/CeruleanTresses:
  ```
  /u/TennisMaster2: "Once upon a time, in a land of magick and wonder, where all newborn babes are granted a unique magical gift upon birth, a child bearing an unusual gift cries for her mother's teat. She does not have the gift of mastery over fire and cold; nor does the have the power to bend light and summon darkness. She can not even bend spoons with her mind! No, her power is much more subtle than that: she can sense and craft mana at will. She's also barely a second old. Surely she'll employ her gift with the great wisdom of an infant. Surely."
