## [D] Friday Open Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.

  A while ago, I wanted to read a deleted Harry Potter fanfic, specifically a deleted HPMOR fanfic.

  It took a while, but I managed to recover [Hermione Granger and the Tesseract of Merlin (Worm x HPMOR)](http://www.mediafire.com/folder/bwx8buculgy2h/Hermione_Granger_and_the_Tesseract_of_Merlin)!

  I did it by downloading the Harry Potter-specific zip from [fanfiction.net-repack](https://archive.org/details/fanfictiondotnet_repack) and finding the single story in it.

  For now, I have about 13 gigabytes of Harry Potter fanfiction downloaded to my computer and if there is anyone else who wants to look for a deleted story, I'm willing to look it up and share them if I have it. I'll probably delete them in a week or two. Make sure to include the author with the title if possible as well.

  I'm not taking down the story I spent time looking for though. That link's staying up there for as long as possible.

    That just links me to the main page of MediaFire.

      Carp! Thanks for letting me know. It's corrected now.

    Do you happen to have Rationalising Death? It was deleted a few years ago for a rewrite but only the first chapter was ever rewritten and uploaded.

      [Here](https://www.mediafire.com/folder/8031a2cb2kaaf/) you go!

      I didn't even need to look in the repack. I already had a copy for my own use.

  I dont know if anyone here has noticed yet- someone has released the code for the City of Heroes MMO thats been dead for the last 6 years. ya know, since the korean company that owned it killed it and sat on the IP. its looking like various private servers will appear in the near future.

  I'm considering running a rational or at least rational adjacent Inheritance cycle quest (the eragon series).

  Would anyone here be interested in playing?
  ```

  - u/Timewinders:
    ```
    Sounds good to me. I like SV quests in general, even run one of my own (though I haven't updated in a long time).
    ```

  - u/boomfarmer:
    ```
    How would one play?
    ```

    - u/Iwasahipsterbefore:
      ```
      I would most likely run it on sufficientvelocity.

      Quests are games where the QM controls the world and npcs, while the forum/players control a single person. Most quests work by having the players work on and vote on a plan together, with the QM replying with how the plan turned out in the form of an in universe story.

      It's a LOT of fun ^_^

  Should I apply to business school next year? Help me identify my cognitive biases and gaps in my thinking.

  Background: Will be attending law school next year. Original plan was a dual JD/MBA. Years of work experience in running my startup, tech, and automation.

  Long term goals, in order of importance: My personal happiness, financial stability (I never want to be poor again), maximized global utility.

  I never intended to practice as a lawyer so the JD-only path was unexpected. I had vague thoughts of legal tech, e.g. automation tools for lawyers and clients to increase availability of legal service for all. Not committed to this path.

  After only being accepted to law school, I realized that I could accomplish my legal tech goals without an MBA. I'm not sure how much if that is post-hoc rationalization.

  Pros for MBA: Relatively easy re-application. I only need to rewrite a couple essays. Foot is already in the door because I'm in the JD program.

  Cons: 1 extra year of my life. 65k tuition. Unsure of marginal utility of JD/MBA vs. only JD.

  I'm leaning towards reapplying because the application process itself is quite easy. However, I want to fully think through whether I even need/want an MBA before submitting an app and mentally locking myself in.
  ```

  - u/frostburner:
    ```
    You need to look at whether a MBA is going to get you anything that your experience of running a business hasn't already gotten you. Degrees are fundamentally about giving you the tools you need to be successful in the realms you want to pursue. If you already possess those tools, then the degree is thousands of dollars that is unnecessarily spent. Seeing as you also don't seem to want any kind of professional certifications either, the degree is only providing tools. Masters programs in general are more for people who want to go super specific down one lane of their expertise, and honestly I think you already have that with JD. What you want to do seems to rely more on the understanding of legal processes, and while an MBA might give you the tools to achieve that faster or to a greater success. It's not gonna give you tools that you can't necessarily gain on your own. 

    Personally, the Cons seem to be very big long term things, whereas the Pros seem to be very short term benefits. I would personally just stick with doing the JD in your place. But at the same time, if you think the tools an MBA would give is worth more than the costs, go for it.

  TIL that jelly expires.

  I always thought that it was similar to peanut butter. It's not.

  Last night I ate a pb&j sandwich with jelly that was 4 years spoiled.

  Never again.

  Check your food, folks.
  ```

  - u/Robert_Barlow:
    ```
    Jelly spoils if it gets moldy or too warm. But you should be able to keep it in your fridge (or in your cupboard, if it's sealed) pretty much indefinitely. Must have been a pretty strange set of circumstances.
    ```

  - u/RetardedWabbit:
    ```
    It didn't taste or smell spoiled?

    I've eaten a lot of food past the expiration date on accident, and I've always noticed the taste, but none that had actually spoiled. As long as it looks, smells, and tastes ok I'd trust it, aside from potential botulism.
    ```

    Peanut butter doesn't spoil? I thought it was only honey that stayed good indefinitely.

      Clean, dry, reasonably sealed PB will last several years easily. The combination of oil and salt content make it hard for bacteria to grow. It will eventually go rancid, but 4 years is pretty common.

  This is going to be very damaging for my productivity but does anyone have any paid android games to recommend that don't have ads or IAP? I'd much rather pay $4 for a decent game than get a "free" game that requires me to buy gems to make decent progression or sit through ads in between every two levels. I don't want any of those games that you pay an IAP to remove the ads but there are still other IAP for extra "clue scrolls" or whatever shit, and though I'd love a completely free game I'd also love to support a more "honest" business model.

  My recommendations:

  - Achikaps, a real time strategy game. The free version has 50 levels and no ads. The paid version has ~150 levels, no ads, and more features

  - Mini Metro, a puzzle game. I don't think it has a free version but it's extremely addictive even if there's a bug at the moment that makes some of the achievements almost impossible to get. 

  (And yes, my phone is rooted and does have an ad blocker)
  ```

  - u/bacontime:
    ```
    The only game I play on android is the port of [Simon Tatham's Puzzles.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=name.boyle.chris.sgtpuzzles&hl=en_US) It's very barebones, and the ui is ugly. But there's no ads or any bloat. Just endless randomly generated puzzles.
    ```

    - u/MagicWeasel:
      ```
      Yes! I've also got that one. It's good fun, and I really found the UI good once I got the hang of it.
      ```

  - u/SvalbardCaretaker:

    The amazing free Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup has an android port. Rougelike, eg. terrible graphics, permadeath (no save/reloading), high replay value, focus on interesting decisionmaking. Grinding is against the games philosophy, there is for a example a button for autoexplore, autotravel, you have ingame-wide search. 

    Highly addictive, but great for inducing flow (and rage!)

      DCSS is my all-time favourite game but last time I played on Android (~4 years ago?) the interface really wasn't up to snuff. Looking at the screenshots it seems much the same - on screen keyboard? 

      I think also if I get used to it then I *really* won't get anything done. DCSS is something else!
      ```

      - u/SvalbardCaretaker:
        ```
        Very true, on small phones the interface isn't good enough, too high chance of missclicking.  But if you have one of these 5" superphones that should work.

        Yeah, I got addicted and somehow stumbled into a speedrun record... So maybe better if you don't get into it.
        ```

          I've got an OP5 so it's big enough but I always played Crawl on my computer and have muscle memory (I've been playing it 10+ years... :|)
          ```

          - u/SvalbardCaretaker:
            ```
            Glad to hear it. I have no further recommendations, I don't play on my phone otherweise.

    A few excellent boardgames have had Android ports without shitty business models. They are noticeably more expensive upfront, but you pay for quality.

    * [*Through the Ages*](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.czechgames.tta&hl=en_GB), excellent civilization-style optimisation card game. Currently ranked [3rd best boardgame of all time](https://boardgamegeek.com/browse/boardgame?sort=rank&rankobjecttype=subtype&rankobjectid=1&rank=3#3) on boardgamegeek, and I tend to agree. Very good port

    * [*Galaxy Trucker*](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.czechgames.galaxytrucker): a frantic real-time spaceship building phase, followed by an extensive scoring phase where your ship will go on adventures and slowly fall to pieces.

    * [*Paperback*](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.fowers.paperback) and/or [*Hardback*](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.fowers.hardback), two solid deck-building word games. *Paperback* is the simple clean design, while *Hardback* has more complex boardgame mechanics.
    ```

    - u/MagicWeasel:
      ```
      I have put Through the Ages on my wishlist - it's expensive but if it's good then I'd love to support it! 

      And the "related" games that show up on the sidebar give me some more places to poke around. 

      I've got the old Androdominion deckbuilder (not available anymore, but the apk still is) on my phone which is fun to break out every now and again, so Paperback and Hardback might be perfect for me!

      Galaxy Trucker isn't grabbing me. I wish Android had a more lax refund policy because if I had a couple of hours to try it out instead of 15 minutes I'd be willing to take a gamble on it. Still might do it though but again another wishlist one.
      ```

      - u/SvalbardCaretaker:
        ```
        Trough the ages is great. Galaxy is great too, but more of an offline thing with friends - half the fun is laughing at each others (mis)fortune. Plus its got the steep real-time learning curve, so 15min is definitely too short.
        ```

  - u/dinoseen:
    ```
    You must build a boat is neat match 3 game with progression and various objectives, it's a sequel to 1000000000, which is similar and also good.
    ```

    - u/MagicWeasel:
      ```
      I've played a few levels (got to stage 2, with the "swamp"(?)) and really have been enjoying it, cheers for the recco!
      ```

      - u/dinoseen:
        ```
        No worries, glad to hear it :)
        ```

  - u/dinoseen:
    ```
    Ridiculous Fishing is also a lot of fun.
    ```

  - u/dinoseen:

    Duet is also really neat.

  - u/adgnatum:
    ```
    [Pixel Dungeon](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.watabou.pixeldungeon&hl=en_US) is open-source. It's actually free.
    ```

- u/None:
  ```
  I understand the math perfectly well, but the precision required for cutting mitre joints is throwing me for a loop; it has me second guessing how accurate everything I own is.
  ```

  - u/causalchain:
    ```
    I have a friend that can just look at the shape he needs to cut, and can cut something that fits well with minimal measurement. I get the impression that some peoples' brains are just wired for physical tasks better than others. Things you own that are handmade by others are more likely to be made by these kinds of people than otherwise. So as a conjecture, while there are probably things you own that are slightly off, most things should be pretty accurate.

  The game "merchant" makes a point of being an idle game without microtransactions, and it's enjoyable for a few weeks before it gets repetitive

  ```
  Anyone know how difficult it would be to code a solid forum designed specifically for writing?  When I do get time to write again, I would like a decent place for it, and I can't find anything I like.

  Some features that I would like to see:

  * Authors have full control of their threads.
  * multiple sub threads for each fiction thread.
  * heuristic reading suggestions based on other people who like things you like.
  * heuristic moderation so the community can moderate itself.

  For instance, if I create a thread for a story, I will have three sub threads.  Beta. Release. Edited.

  Beta could be password protected.  Release would be open to all.  Edited could be password protected.

  Each subsection would have a full thread devoted to each chapter.

  Chapter threads would actually be properly threaded, in the old school News Net style, so multiple unrelated conversations could happen without diluting everything.

  I believe that heuristic moderation would end up requiring some sort of user validation.

  Perhaps a fee of 1.00 per month to validate accounts, and allow comments and liking/disliking?

  Perhaps redistribute those membership fees back to active writers based off of who the paying customers read?

  Allow users to donate at will, to individual authors or to the writer's pool as a built in feature?

  In essence, I would like a site dedicated to both writing and reading fiction, at multiple stages, with automatic protections to prevent botters and zergs.

  I want this enough that I might even consider paying to have it designed.
