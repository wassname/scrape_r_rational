## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  I watched *Atlantis : The Lost Empire* again after 15 years, and wow, this movie really isn't as good or profound as I remembered. The basic story is about an expedition to find the sunk city of Atlantis, lead by a mercenary whose face screams "Going to betray you all for money in the third act", a bunch a quirky international first-class experts in demolition/mechanic/archeology/etc, plus two hundreds crew members. The unnamed crew members start dying ridiculously fast and the expedition loses their giant steampunk submarine and most of their supplies, but after a while they finally make it into Atlantis. The local king immediately decides to kill them for trespassing and being rather obviously looking for trouble, but her daughter convinces him to let them rest for a day, then kick them out, and in the meantime asks for the archeologist's help finding the forgotten secrets of her civilization (though how they could forget anything even though they all have eternal life is beyond me). So the greedy capitalist leader of the expedition turns out to be a greedy capitalist and decides to steal the power source that keeps the atlanteans alive, go back to civilization and make loads of money. The main characters refuse to help him and get left behind, but they find Atlantean warplanes and go get the power source back, killing what's left of their fellow crew members in the battle (but who cares, their lives can't be worth anything since we don't know their names, right?). The main characters then go back to civilization with a bunch of worthless yellow metal the atlanteans had lying around, and thus become filthy rich (except the protagonist, who stays with the natives).

  My main problem with this movie is that it made me feel incredibly sorry for the nameless crew members, but never followed up on it. More than a hundred redshirts die when the Leviathan sinks their submarine, and they're given a brief sort-of-funeral, then are never mentioned again, and the expedition continues without a hitch. None of the survivors mention loosing a friend or a brother, they're all perfectly content to follow the expedition's leader even when his orders get them killed, and in the final battle, none of them goes "Wait, I actually *don't* want to die to help exterminate an ancient civilization for money". And at the end of the movie, when the main characters go back to civilization, no one seems shocked that they're the only survivors of an expedition that started with two hundred people. So even though I really liked this movie as a kid, I'm having a hard time remembering why. :p

  As an aside (and not a bad thing in any way), it's funny to realize years later that the main character (Milo) is so completely Disney's Daniel Jackson. Polyglot archeologist who discovered an ancient super-advanced civilization through reading old texts, check, no one believes him (or his grandfather who said the same thing), check, is approached by a mysterious powerful expedition who believes him and needs him for an expedition, check, has trouble integrating with the military crew, check, befriends the locals first, check, stays behind with a native girl while his friends go back to civilization and pretend he's dead, check.

    "What was that secret for the defence of our kingdom again?"

    "You know what, I don't remember. Maybe we should refresh our memories on this vital topic on a regular basis, or perhaps write the information down."

    "Oh, I believe it is written down. Naturally, nobody in this kingdom has any time for that reading nonsense. Nonetheless I remain confident that we will never *all* forget how to read, nor would we have any need of the concept anyway."

    "Quite right, quite right. Now what's say you and I have a fluent conversation in one of the dozens of languages that descend from our own?"

    "The ones we've never heard yet have word-perfect knowledge of even after literal millennia?"

    "Yes, those ones."

    "Sounds good to me old chap. After all, we wouldn't want to forget them now would we?"

    Then years later, by sheer necessity, he became ripped and is able to actually use guns. 

    And he actually do perform archaeology, unlike pseudo-aracheologists like....Lara Croft and Indiana Jones.
    ```

  - u/xamueljones:
    ```
    My rationalization about their treatment of all the nameless mooks is that none of them are actually on an archeology trip. No, that's what Milo is on a trip for and as a slightly unreliable narrator that's what we see the other travelers as. Instead they are a group of people who would have been in prison for several years and are sent on a foolhardy expedition in exchange for not going to jail. Milo's backers are not actually super-powerful mysterious people who believes Milo unlike everyone else. No, his backers were people who don't want to have to house criminals for years and if Milo finds something, great! But otherwise everyone either dies or are released when they return. This explained why everyone apart from Milo seemed like a group of criminals and were willing to follow such an obvious bad guy (every other potential leader were equally shady and was a worse choice). Also, no one's going to *really* mourn the passing of criminals.

    The language thing is explained by the fact that writing systems slowly changed over time and no bothered to retain knowledge of how to read the older writings because royalty were the only ones allowed to see the engravings and even they only ever visited the engravings a handful of times in their lives. Therefore it went from a father who knew how to read them (barely) to a lazy son who pretended to be able to read them well enough to get out of the boring and "unnecessary" duty of learning how to read the carvings. Then the father died abruptly and then the son realized that nobody knows how to read the carvings well enough to teach him. They may be immortal, but that doesn't mean they can't die of something other than old age or that they can perfectly remember every skill they have learned.

    Remember that this was what I thought was going on when I watched the movie as a 6-7 year-old. So I don't actually know if this makes sense in context of what we see in the movie.

  I just stumbled upon [the manga](http://kissmanga.com/Manga/The-Gamer/Vol-001-Ch-001-Read-Online?id=174343) whose fanfic [The Games We Play](http://rationalreads.com/?#/works/104) got shared here a while back. (I do not recommend the fanfic either.) Decided to give it a chance. Reached the part where the protagonist levels up for the first time and *puts all his points in Strength* and dropped it in a hurry.

    *Cough*. I don't remember him leveling up strength. Oh I'm sure he did once... he's just been pouring just about every point into Int ever since. Not that it actually seems to have made him much smarter. Int and Wis in video-games are just magic stats after all.

    Besides, there's nothing you can't solve with BRUTE STRENGTH.

        In Ryuugi's "The Games We Play" Jaune primarily levels wis.

        In "The Gamer" Han Jee-Han primarily levels int.

        They both have trouble depicting increased intelligence, but again, I'm not certain what Int is even supposed to mean in The Gamer. It legitimately barely seems to be more than a magic stat, at least for Jee-Han. I mean I guess it's fine if Jee-Han isn't *supposed* to get smarter with int boosts.
        ```

        - u/ZeroNihilist:
          ```
          Int gain is a somewhat nebulous concept anyway. What would it mean for you to be smarter without actually knowing more? Increased working memory, greater ability to recognise cognitive biases that you already know, or perhaps simply the speed of your mental processes?

          Stories that feature characters getting smarter usually take the Sherlock approach—they gain the ability to perform magical abductive reasoning (I wanted to just write "abductions", but that meaning of the word is decidedly less common) and an eidetic memory, even of things they saw *before* the int upgrade (and, most often, never explicitly saw at all).

          Actually modelling somebody's thought process and what they would get stuck on is really hard. We're poor predictors of our own future behaviour, let alone a stranger's.

          One part that frustrated me about The Games We Play was that Jaune levelled int and wis so high that he effectively became psychic. That's not to mention his absurd perceptive abilities, which just kept getting closer and closer to omniscience unless the plot required him to not notice something. So Ryuugi mostly skipped illustrating his thought process and just outright handed down declarations of truth from on high.

          Honestly though the thing that most frustrated me was the writing. Usually a few times per chapter he'd use the same conspicuous phrase or word in proximity. And the chapters which seemingly existed just to show off how badass the characters were ("It's apparently a tradition for large groups of ninja wizards to cause wanton destruction in a battle at funerals, so let's do that."), especially when those characters added almost nothing to the larger plot.

          [Spoiler: ](#s "Early-ish in the story, Jaune's mother is severely wounded. Jaune spends ages getting better at healing so that he can heal her, while dealing with his many sisters talking about how their mother abused them to make them better hunters. Then he heals her and... nothing. Most of the sisters and the mother are just never heard from again. He doesn't even do anything spectacular with his healing ability. It's basically a 'he improved his skill offscreen' story except onscreen.")

          Oh and why, whenever Jaune levels more than once, does it say "Your level has increased by one!" multiple times? Why not "Your level has increased by 7" or at least don't specify "by one".

          Eh, I could gripe about this story for a long time. It needs a brutal edit before I'd recommend it.

            That’s actually a reference to how at least some (MMO)RPGs work. The default scripted response is to inform the player whenever they manage to push [the ever-so-slowly crawling](http://imgur.com/a/amnkG)^1 experience bar over the edge and get a Level Up, so if you manage to kill mobs [that are significantly stronger](http://imgur.com/a/9SU78) than your player character, it’s possible^2 you’ll insta-jump through several levels at once.

    Agreed on The Games We Play. It's pretty slow-paced, but the real problem is that Jaune is completely out of character, even considering the INT and WIS boosts. Which is fine IMO when, like in HPMOR, the character getting replaced is boring, but I felt like the new Jaune in this fic was less interesting. I prefer Ryuugi's Prytaneum, where Percy Jackson retains his most important character traits.

I disliked it less than I disliked the other two reboot movies (for which I *also* was dragged to a theater...), I think--though, at this point, my memories of the other two movies are *quite* fuzzy.

  A thought that crossed my mind many times in the course of the movie was that it was a gigantic waste of money to have a zillion fancy visual effects when I wasn't enjoying *watching* the movie any more than I would have enjoyed *reading* [a random *Star Wars* novel](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/263012). I can visualize the *Enterprise* just as well as I can visualize the *Millennium Falcon*--a zillion enemy-of-the-week fightercraft in swarm formation as well as an endless fleet of coralskippers coordinated by a yammosk--James Kirk as well as Corran Horn. Once the basic images have been established--once the reader has something on which he can base the vision of his mind's eye (maybe nothing more than a book's front cover and back cover)--expensive sounds and images are no longer necessary.

  \- A troll *lies* to get [(You)](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/you-here-s-your-you)s, while an attention whore is *perfectly truthful.*  
  \- A troll comments with the *intent* to split the community into factions of a flame war, while an attention whore just wants to get *recognition* for himself and doesn't expect his actions to have any major effect on the people with whom he's interacting.

    I think you underestimate the impact that audio and visual stimulus can have, or possibly just experience it differently from other people. A well-shot action sequence uses a vocabulary and grammar that works on a largely subconscious level, and which other mediums have only partial access to. The methods of invoking a feeling of, say, claustrophobia are completely different in film and prose.

    Edit: I just realized I'm repeating Marshall McLuhan's "the medium is the message".

    - u/DaystarEld:
      ```
      To build on this, have you ever seen the youtube channel [Every Frame a Painting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FOzD4Sfgag), /u/ToaKraka?  It does a great job of showing how, in the hands of a competent screen writer and director, visual and audio can communicate a hundred thousand subtle and meaningful ideas in ways that are unique to the medium. The above linked example goes to a video on comedy, but he has a ton of others to show it in other ways too.

      The key word there of course is *competent,* which might be better phrased as "exceptional." I know many people who like Abrams as a director, but personally I've found him mediocre at best. He's never "wow"ed me with his directing, for all the fancy visual effects and cutting edge CGI.
      ```

    - u/ToaKraka:
      ```
      > I think you underestimate the impact that audio and visual stimulus can have

      I don't deny that visuals *can* have an impact. For example, I consider the opening scene of *[Speed Racer](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0811080)* to be *at least* as awesome as [the fight between Sakura and the Zombie Combo in *Time Braid*](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644/27). However, these are *outliers.* When the *average* orgy of visual effects and the *average* literary action scene are equivalent in impact, and the visual effects are significantly more expensive than the simple words, spending extra money on visual effects doesn't make much sense.

      The same response can serve to counter u/DaystarEld's contribution. In my opinion, subtle implications can be made in books just as well as they can be made with movies.
      ```

      - u/DaystarEld:
        ```
        Subtle implications can be made in books, but I would argue that certain implications can be made much more elegantly and powerfully in visual medium, to the point that I can't think off the top of my head of ever seeing equivalents to them in books. 

        Take comedy again as an example. As demonstrated to some extent in the linked video, most movies rely almost completely on dialogue and absurd events or obvious visual gags for comedy, because they're written as screenplays, which have access to all the same things books do, just without narration. A great director can inject comedy in tiny things, subtle absurdity in quick movements and camera shots and sound effects, that just can't be done with narration in a book. Or at least, I've never seen it done well.

        I'm interested to know, what are some of your favorite comedy movies and books? How would you compare them?

    troll: maliciously motivated
    attention whore: selfishly motivated

    At least, that's the best definition I can think of for it.

      IMO, a troll is a subset of the attention whore set. A troll is both selfishly and maliciously motivated while an attention whore may not be outright malicious.

        There may be big overlaps but it's not a subset. A troll may not care at all whether they're personally getting attention, as long as the community burns down around them.

    But the Star Trek movie had those adorable babboon-armadillo aliens!  How can you not want to take one home as a pet?

    And I guess they managed to half-ass an ideological conflict in there, too.

  Over on the [Discord](https://discordapp.com/channels/196309529850281984/196309529850281984) that about 20 or so people from /r/rational are on - mainly for pen and paper D&D games - there is a game seeking players. The plan is for there to be between 2 and 3 parties of 4-5 playing either Don't Rest Your Head, Don't Lose Your Mind, or Dragonball Z Fusion, depending on player vote. We've got around 5 players so far and the relevant channel is called unk-looking-for-group. Players who are interested please register your interest.

  Also the channel somegodssomewhere are interested in more players to play The Fragile Gods of Somewhere. More information may be found in the appropriate channels.
