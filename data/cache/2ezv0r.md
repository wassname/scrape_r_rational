    Couldn't they just wish up another one if they lost this one? Or are you worried about someone having access to the same magic?

    It's useful, sure, but he has effectively free wishes now with FLEA. The only loss would be his enemies gaining it, and they can surely wish their own

  I hate gods.

  If Arros' behaviour shows how the gods *normally* treat humans who are on their side, Loki's been impossibly nice to Jake so far. 

  I think Loki has a more personal stake in this matter. If this was just the war between the gods, Team Life vs Team Death, then you'd expect all the Team Life gods to be equally helpful to the humans, modulo differences in personality. And the God Of Playing Cruel Pranks is not the one that you'd expect to be straightforward.

  Either that or Arros doesn't care as much as Loki about the outcome of the war. Afi's minions have a lot of spellcasters among them, so Arros doesn't really stand to lose a lot if Team Life dies out. Not as much as the God of Chaos loses if everybody is replaced by mindless servants.

  Yeah, that's probably it actually. Still, I'm keeping an eye on Loki's motivations. There's a lot we don't know.

    > Yeah, that's probably it actually. Still, I'm keeping an eye on Loki's motivations. There's a lot we don't know.

    I'm taking a somewhat non-standard view of Loki.  In many of the myths he was a cruel, evil trickster, and he had a big hand in setting off Ragnarok.  In some myths, he was an ally of humanity -- he taught them how to make fishing nets, for example.

    The Loki I'm using leans more towards the later view, and is heavily mixed in with Coyote and other trickster gods.  The "trickster is evil becuase plot" thing bores me; I wanted someone more mercurial and unpredictable.

    There is at least one more major reveal related to the gods that will clarify your questions.  Right now, I don't think I've given out enough information for people to reasonably figure out why everyone is doing the things they're doing.  I promise I'll get there, though.

      Since I've got your attention, here's something that's been puzzling me: The Edict is basically "don't do anything that might let you ascend to godhood". But that doesn't match up with last week's talk about godhood theory: gods start out as stories, not people. You can't actually ascend to godhood... can you?
      ```

      - u/eaglejarl:
        ```
        Yep, you can. There is even an canonical example of someone who ascended, although it was a blink-and-you'll-miss-it reference.
        ```

        - u/Zephyr1011:
          ```
          I vaguely recall something about Shailos ascending 6000 years ago, or being younger. Although I may be confusing 2YE with other things I've been reading
          ```

          - u/eaglejarl:
            ```
            You are not. Congratulations on not blinking. :)
            ```

      - u/failed_novelty:
        ```
        Why not?  After all, if someone does enough legendary things, they become legends themselves.  And it's a small step from praying that a god will save you to praying that the legendary hero (who lives just over that hill) will save you.  Once you've had a 'Big Damn Heroes' moment a few times and saved the day for people who were praying you would (even if you didn't know they were)...well, at that point you're probably at least half-way towards having honest-to-you worshipers.
        ```

        - u/Chronophilia:
          ```
          Excellent point. But then what does that have to do with infinite-wish loops? Are we expecting people to pray that Jake the Lord High Munchkin will save the day? Considering that the gods react in seconds to the Ring of Three Wishes exploit, that seems like overkill.

          Particularly since they don't seem to mind the FLEA, which is just as likely to produce legend-tier heroes.
          ```

          - u/failed_novelty:
            ```
            The gods most likely LOVE FLEA.  FLEA gets lots of people up to high level, which means they don't need to be saved as much.  That means they'll look to other people to save them far less.  Also, it generates at least some clerics of different gods (though they are focusing on a single deity at the moment).

            Lots of high-level people means that there's more powerful worshipers, and when level 60 people are common, it's a lot harder for a single person (or party) to become legendary.

            Infinite Wish loops are a threat to the gods because they can produce a single mortal (or group of mortals) with improbable levels of power.  Individuals or groups about whom tales will be told...and those tales are a form of power.

            How many people will tell tales about how bravely Flobova shouted 'Reducio' to slaughter unsuspecting monsters in a trap that others prepared?  Especially when there are 300 others who have the same story?
            ```

            - u/Chronophilia:
              ```
              There's one more detail to consider. In D&D 3.5, the gods are "just" extremely powerful Outsiders with infinite spells per day and a wide assortment of powers and immunities that dwarf anything mortals have access to.

              They can still be killed by dropping their HP to 0. Maybe they're worried that will happen to them if they let one person get too much power.
              ```

              - u/JackStargazer:
                ```
                Basically. by far the most powerful divine ability "Alter Reality" is just wish at will with the restrictions cut off.

                **Alter Reality**

                **Prerequisite:**

                Cha 29.

                **Benefit:**

                This ability is similar to the wish spell. The deity merely thinks of something and then makes it so. Doing this requires at least a standard action.

                **Notes**

                The deity can duplicate any spell of 9th level or lower as a standard action. The duplicated spell has no material or XP component, and the DC of its saving throw (if one is allowed) is 20 + the deity’s rank + the deity’s Charisma modifier.

                The deity also can duplicate a spell with any metamagic feat (so long as the metamagic feat is available to characters of 20th level or lower). This use of the ability requires the deity to rest for 1 round for each level that the feat would normally add to the spell. It still takes a standard action to use this ability, so there is no point in using the ability to duplicate a quickened spell.

                The deity can render a magical or supernatural effect permanent. The rest requirement varies with the effect: 10 minutes per level of the effect times the number of subjects affected, 10 minutes per total Hit Dice of creatures affected, or 10 minutes per 10-foot cube affected. Use the highest applicable value.

                ~~The deity can create temporary, nonmagical objects. This works like the Create Object ability (including the required rest period), except that the items last one day per rank.~~

                ~~The deity also can create permanent nonmagical objects as if using the Create Object ability except that all rest requirements are doubled and there is no reduction in rest time for being on an Outer Plane or in the deity’s own realm.~~

                ~~The deity can create temporary magic items or creatures. This works like the Divine Creation ability (including the required rest period), except that the items or creatures created last 1 hour per rank. This ability cannot create permanent magic items or creatures.~~

                ~~The deity can reshape a landscape, creating any type of terrain the deity can imagine. Each 10-foot cube of material to be reshaped requires 1 round of effort, and the deity must rest for one day per 10-foot cube shaped after the work is completed.~~ 

                You'll notice I scratched out a lot of that. That's because it will never, ever be used. Because there is a spell, somewhere that does it better than that paragraph, and the deity can cast that spell with the ability.

                I mean seriously, who writes this?
                ```

- u/JackStargazer:
  ```
  Yeah, the gods are assholes. Surprising noone really.

  I'm actually surprised they are cool with "Ok, in a week everyone will be level 100" thing.
  ```

  - u/eaglejarl:
    ```
    I'm sure it made them twitch, but people ARE stopping. They're only using it once and, in all honesty, level 60 isn't THAT much on the divine scale.
    ```

    - u/JackStargazer:
      ```
      So I guess your Gods aren't the Deities and Demigods /Faiths and Pantheons style ones, because most of them are around level 60. They get a lot of bonuses, and 20 outsider HD, but that's what they have in class levels.

      Of course salient divine abilities like "Wish at will" kind of break that over backwards.
      ```

      - u/eaglejarl:
        ```
        I haven't been too fussed over the details; I pretty much assume that gods are effectively unbeatable by mortals except in VERY unusual circumstances, given that whole "alter reality and freeze time on a whim" thing. 

        But, yes, you're right on all counts.
        ```

        - u/JackStargazer:
          ```
          Yeah, just by itself Alter Reality (cast any spell once per round, no XP or gold components, Save DC = lots + more) does everything we've seen the gods do so far. Time Stop once every 3 rounds lets you time stop forever, Wish at will is... well, wish at will. And the autoscry when your name is mentioned thing is part of divine portfolio powers.

          Your gods actually fit so far, assuming every one of them has Alter Reality (Which is like saying 'assuming every olympic sprinter has legs').

  Icefi changing his alignment seems incredibly useful if it's anything like Colborn. Although, would he not be constrained still by his programming? And does he have the power to subvert all of Afi's local troops with helms? Including the other ice assassins. 

  Also, Arros is a dick. Who appears to also have lied to them by promising safety during the meeting, and then essentially killing Reynard during it. Odd from the god of lawyers who is presumably lawful. 

  This fragment definitely seems a lot more significant than just a universe breaking consultant. A spy? Does it have god like powers, or just knowledge?

      I guess I figured that Reynard did not actually come back correctly following the resurrection - it seemed like the other shoe needed to drop on that. But I guess I'll find out next week.

        ```
        Isaac came back with a soul rider, Reynard came back with a plague enchantment. Both were dealt with offscreen because it just wasn't that interesting. Neither one had their personality damaged.
        ```

        - u/Zephyr1011:
          ```
          ~~What is a soul rider?~~ And given that a plague can presumably be easily cured by clerics, why would Neklos have sent it when he can send more damaging things? As a god, he presumably does not lack the resources to do that

          EDIT: Forget that first question, I found a quote about it

          >"We've had different ones. Sometimes it will be a demon that rides along with the resurrection, using it like a reverse Gate. Sometimes there will be a taint on the person's soul that works like a communicable form of mummy rot. Sometimes the dark gods have modified the mind attached to the soul, so the one resurrected returns as an agent of evil. Sometimes...well, the list goes on. The dark gods are very creative, and Neklos in particular is both cruel and evil.
          ```

          - u/eaglejarl:
            ```
            An evil creature that catchs a ride back to Earth on the soul of a creature being resurrected, sort of like a reverse Gate. It was described a few chapters ago. 

            Disease: it's a supercharged and highly contagious version of mummy rot. If it gets into the population when people are crammed as tight as in Grofhamr, it causes massive numbers of death before clerics can get in top of it.

            - u/Zephyr1011:
              ```
              Would it make sense to create cleric Ice Assassins and use those for resurrecting? After all, Ice Assassins dying is no great loss.

              Would Ice Assassins be able to use the Graham's Number XP Battery to create more of themselves? And if so, would they obey the orders of the original person, or of the Assassin?

  The left hand rule makes several assumptions about the maze which you can't fairly make. e.g. if the destination is in the center, surrounded by an unbroken moat of corridor, you'll never reach the end.

              Let me try Anselm's Ontological Argument for my divinity to get you a wish:

              God is defined as the greatest possible being  
              I can conceive of God  
              If God does not exist, I can conceive of a greater being, one who exists  
              This would contradict the assumption of God's maximal greatness  
              Therefore God exists  
              If God is the greatest possible being, they must also be the greatest possible being I can conceive of  
              If God were not me, I would perceive that as a flaw  
              God can have no flaws  
              Therefore I am God  
              God is omnipotent  
              I am God, therefore I am omnipotent  

              I use my powers to cause a Ring of 3 Wishes to appear before you upon you reading this statement

                  Sure, the XP should arrive in 20d20 rounds. Apologies for the shipping time, but first class was far too expensive, even for an omnipotent being like myself. 

                  Just make one of your wishes for an arbitrarily large supply of writing of superior quality to 2YE (assuming such a thing is possible for the ring) to appear on your fanfiction.net account and I will consider the gift repaid in full. After wishing for a Ring of 3\^\^\^3 wishes of course. Even a God requires amusement. And using my omnipotence for that would most definitely be cheating

    >Trémaux's algorithm, invented by [Charles Pierre Trémaux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Pierre_Tr%C3%A9maux),  is an efficient method to find the way out of a maze that requires drawing lines on the floor to mark a path, and is guaranteed to work for all mazes that have well-defined passages.  A path is either unvisited, marked once or marked twice. Every time a direction is chosen it is marked by drawing a line on the floor (from junction to junction). In the beginning a random direction is chosen (if there is more than one). On arriving at a junction that has not been visited before (no other marks), pick a random direction (and mark the path). When arriving at a marked junction and if your current path is marked only once then turn around and walk back (and mark the path a second time). If this is not the case, pick the direction with the fewest marks (and mark it, as always).. When you finally reach the solution, paths marked exactly once will indicate a direct way back to the start. If there is no exit, this method will take you back to the start where all paths are marked twice. In this case each path is walked down exactly twice, once in each direction. The resulting [walk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_graph_theory#Walks) is called a bidirectional double-tracing.

      I was reading him as exaggeratedly indulgent, like 'Sure, that's okay.. after all, I can wipe you out with a finger flick if I feel like it'. That's why I picked his particular characteristic as arrogance -- obviously all gods have that level of power, but eg Neklos doesn't seem the pretentiously arrogant type, more the "DOOM FOR EVERYBODY! YOU GET A DOOM, AND YOU GET A DOOM, AND YOU AND YOU AND YOU! ^Have ^fun ^with ^that, ^I ^know ^I ^will. ". I get the impression their personalities generally match their portfolio.

    As to promoting the high level people -- I had just assumed they used more Linnorms but your way is more efficient.  :)

    (Although you do have to wait 24 hours for the negative levels to become actual level loss, and that would have interfered with doing it overnight, but meh.)
