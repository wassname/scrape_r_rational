## [D] If you had a control of biology, what fun things could you do with it?

### Post:

I've been trying to hammer out the framework of a new story, to be loosely based around *Tarzan of the Apes*. Jane Porter is a budding young scientist who gets marooned in Africa while trying to find new crops with industrial applications - which is where she comes across Tarzan of the Apes, who has a seemingly supernatural ability to alter the biology of any living creature that he touches.

If you've read *Worm*, think Panacea's power but gimped to all hell.

So with that in mind, what are the first things that you would try if you discovered that you could change the biology of the living things around you? I'm trying to determine what the exact bounds of this power are - what it allows and doesn't allow - but to know for sure I need to know what the obvious exploits are.

Edit: Thanks for a lot of great responses. I have some thinking to do.

  *While the page loaded, I was thinking "Give spider-girl the power to save the world", but...*

  -------------------------

  I would be very, very cautious.  

  No inheritable changes.  No mental self-editing, ever, and physical only after years of testing.  Nothing infectious.  Extreme caution in anything with an ecological impact.  (incidentally, this should be standard for research on replicators or biomanipulation)

  Things I would want to try:  

  * elimination of diseases - can I heal the sick?  Create swarms of sterile mosquitoes?  Vaccinate against everything with a touch?

  * agriculture is an obvious route:  if set before ~1950, replicate the work of Borglaug in the Green Revolution (primarily dwarfism for higher yield, some pest resistance).  Pest resistance.  Laugh at the idea that herbicide resistance is an optimal use of this power (ie Monsanto's monopoly-enabled strategy).  More nutrition from staples.  Mention concerns about crop diversity and resilience.  

  * creation of custom things:  eg 1000kg tuna are absurdly valuable, can I touch a tree and grow a shelter, turn a cow into 100% prime steaks, etc.  Something like a tropical rainforest or those clonal forests would become a *genius loci* in this scenario.  

  Tarzan basically looks like Panacea-lite, limited by (head-pre-canon) a genuine desire to avoid any ecological harm and lack of education in arcane possibilities.  He may also be offended by the basic concept of agricultural monocultures (character tension!).  

  Is the power somehow innate to his identity?  Body?  Lifestyle?  Dependant on a code of conduct?  Only usable for applications that fit some theme?  It could also remain unexplained, with Tarzan not knowing if some actions could lead to losing the power and unwilling to take the risk (best limiter, IMO).

  Meat Trees. Alternatively, decouple the fruit and reproduction cycle, so a plant will make food year round.

  Make grass crystallize sugar.

  Experiment with left-handed molecules. It's said that whoever invents cheap left-handed sucrose will be the first trillionaire.

  Make a farm animal like sheep or goat grow spider-silk, or carbon-nanotubes.

  - u/DiscyD3rp:

    I'd love to hear more about this left handed sucrose. How is it different, and why would It be worth so much? Is it related to chirality, which I've heard used to describe nucleic proteins?
    ```

    - u/Escapement:
      ```
      As I understand it: Sucrose is a asymmetric molecule. The mirror image version of sugar tastes sweet but can't be digested by our enzymes so it's basically perfect dieting sugar. However, there may be health effects from this sort of thing related to e.g. internal bacteria digesting it or not, so it may not be a perfect silver bullet. It's interesting to speculate about, anyways. Yes, this is related to chirality - as I understand it, the d variant of both glucose and fructose is required for the body to digest sucrose, and the presence of mirror-imaged l-variant of one, the other, or both makes it indigestible.
      ```

      - u/DiscyD3rp:
        ```
        My question about that is, what chemical behavior maintains taste but not digestibility? Why would the mirror sucrose still affect your tongue? It seems interesting that mirror molecules are incompatible with only *some kinds* of chemistry.
        ```

        - u/Prezombie:
          ```
          It's not that mirror molecules are incompatible with some kinds of chemistry, there's only one kind of chemistry, and it's called chemistry.

          Mirror molecules are incompatible with some processes which alter or filter the molecule.

          In this case, it's the intestinal brush border membrane performing hydrolysis.

  Compress/optimize every system in the body, to start. This means:

  * Your organs don't need to be in the same places
  * Every organ is much less prone to failure
  * Every organ is stronger (superhuman strength, vision, hearing, fortitude)
  * There's room for redundancy organs, for increased survivability
  * Immunity to every disease/poison

  I would probably relocate my brain from an easy target to something like the middle of my chest surrounded by bone made of layered graphene. Without even changing the brain's structure, there are studies that intelligence is largely how fast you can think, and how fast you can think is largely determined by how fast electricity goes through your neurons, so if you compress everything to a much smaller size, chances are you just made yourself extremely intelligent without even needing to understand the neuron paths. This above anything else is the largest increase in the ability to get the things that you want.

  Retractable wings - you can fly. Gills/webbed hands - you can live underwater. Removal of digestion system in place of chlorophyll in cells letting you survive (or even just help survive) via photosynthesis. Wallclimbing, rapid shape changing, color changing, and extreme tunneling are options too. With the extra room from compressing your organs you can hold all the changes without even looking different.

  Removal of sleep, more production of energy/motivation chemicals. Healing and recovery factor off the charts, you could set your attention exactly as you need.

  You'd have to be careful not to touch the pleasure center of my brain, because you'd quickly reduce yourself to a gibbering idiot where you did nothing but expand and stimulate it.

  And this is just for day to day. When you go "sense-mode" there's also stuff like filia that are extremely tough and extend around you for miles, giving you an extreme sense of the world. More eyeballs would also help, to see behind you. You could make your skin more effective sandpaper than a sharks by a few orders of magnitude, making every rope or restraint worthless against you. 

  You could create clones, minions, or pets that you control directly and do exactly as you want. It would be biological warfare on a macro scale, something we've never seen. No existing tech could stand to it. You could make 'simple' animals for this, like bees that consider anything not wearing your clothing or your smell to be an enemy, fly at mach 2, sting with the poison of a blue ring octopus, and expire naturally after 10 minutes. 

  You could single handedly create the Zerg and everything good about them. Hives that produce more spawn for you, everything is 100% susceptible (and more than that, absolutely willing) to your command. World conquering is easy, you could *improve* the world. Give everyone a pet that carries genes to manufacture antidotes to 99% of known diseases. Make it optimally cute and no one will resist getting one.

  Panacea was so OP the author had to cripple her by making her unwilling to use her abilities.

    In terms of flying, you're going to have difficulties if you keep your human weight. Look up the size of say hang gliders or paragliders. You need wings that big to glide. If you add power by flapping say you could reduce it a bit, but then huge amounts of body mass has to go into flight muscles. Unless your power allows you to break physics you'll have a hard time. (not that it can't be done, a hang glider only weighs 20kg and a paraglider even less, but getting ready for launch would take a couple of minutes as you unpack your wings.)

    As to supersonic bees, I doubt it can be done they are simply too small. You could create a biological gun/launcher by using vacuum and pressure (youtube supersonic pingpong ball) and the bullet could have basic control, but it'd be more like a smart bullet than an independent plane.

  Intelligence explosion.

  Experiment to discover exactly how the brain works, enhance neural connections, trigger rapid growth in neurons throughout the body for backup brains, upgrade twitch reflexes and perception of time to basically overclock yourself, leading to a sort of biological [wired reflexes](http://shadowrun.wikia.com/wiki/Wired_reflexes).

  Absorb more biomass through consumption or absorption (give yourself this ability), do it more. Program biological nanites to do basically whatever you need them to do.

  Duplicate yourself entirely, as a backup or as a partner guaranteed to share your values (Note - Do not do this unless you are able to implicitly accept any duplicates of yourself as independent beings with right to life - if you consider them expendable, they will consider you expendable.).

  Win. Everything, likely forever.

    I'm wondering if /r/rational should have a rule explicitly outlawing answering any hypothetical question with "intelligence enhancement/explosion".  It's not that it isn't a *genuine* answer, but it's just so damned *easy* to come up with in this community that it doesn't really get into the spirit of the creative-thinking game.

    This would be kind of like how Polandball has a joke-life preserve.

    - u/JackStargazer:

      It's a fair cop. Pretty much all thought experiments have to take into account that the people in this group actually understand (more so than average) how an exponential growth function works, especially as it pertains to intelligence.

      I prefer to consider it debugging. If "intelligence explosion" is a valid answer to your hypothetical, it is probably the best answer, and you should either accept that or refine the rules of the hypothetical to exclude it.

  So. Many. Exploits.  
  Here are a few I thought of.

  * Resource mining plants  
    Have plants that extract various elements from the ground. Rare earths especially. Could also grow balloons of various gasses. (Hindenburg plant anyone?)

  * Carbon sequestration  
    Make a plant that sequesters carbon from the atmosphere. Would help prevent, or solve climate change.

  * Fuel generation  
    Could combine this with the carbon plant. Generate various hydrocarbons.

  * Biolumenescent trees  
    Would replace streetlamps. Would also be useful in areas with no electricity.

  * Retroviral engineering  
    Modify viruses to produce large scale genetic modification such as nitrogen fixation, anti-aging, repair genetic diseases, modify immune systems to fight various cancers, etc. An encryption failsafe is a must to prevent unwanted mutations.

  * Brain modification  
    Increasing brain size would likely be the easiest. Harder, but far more powerful would be overclocking.

  * Ambrosia/Soylent  
    A tasty plant that that contains all a human needs to survive. Make it grow like a weed, and you've solved world hunger.

  * Water plant  
   Have it capture water from the air, but also have a root system that will pump from the watertable. You could also just have it make water from the hydrogen and oxygen in the air.

  * Housing  
   Grows into a living space with various amenities.

  * Molecular manufacturing  
   Now that you have control over the original nanotechnology, you should be able to bootstrap molecular manufacturing.

  =====

  A couple more I thought of.

  * Organic robots  
  Modify a species for repetitive tasks, and you can replace most menial labor. The best species to do this with would be humans, as they would be a direct replacemet. You'd make them mindless and to have a low upkeep (could run them off of soylent). You can further modify them for any specific tasks if needed. Growing them might be a bit of an issue. Best bet would be to create some sort of grow pods, and seed them with modified stem cells.

  * Purifiers  
  Easy to create since a few plants already do this. Removes polution to get clean water and air.

    > Make a plant that sequesters carbon from the atmosphere. Would help prevent, or solve climate change.

    These are called "plants"; the problem is the sheer mass you need.  Let's imagine that all you need to do is buy time, so merely cancelling all 21^st century emissions will do.  

    That's going to be (assuming business-as-usual, which we *really* shouldn't do) about 3,000 GT, or... 3 Zetagrams, 3 x 10^18 Kg.  That's a lot.  So much that I had to look up prefixes, which in an era trending toward peta/exa in computing is crazy.  

    I'm just going to note that the formal estimates say that Australia is unlikely to be able to sequester more than 100 MT per year, which is one three-hundred-millionth of what's required.  

    TL;DR, ***way* too much carbon**

      I know that. -_-  
      I meant making one that would be more effective at it, a la [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosequestration#Enhanced_photosynthesis). I may have worded it poorly but by "helping prevent" it, I meat that it would at least decrease the concentration by a large amount. Also, at least in the Disney movie, the story takes place during the industrial revolution. There would be much less carbon in the air at that period of time. (Though I have no idea if they were aware of climate change at that period of time, so that may be a moot point.)

        All good points. Speaking generally though, it wasn't until after WW2 in the "great acceleration" that humans had much influence over global geochemical cycling - global climate change just wasn't an issue. 

        There might be some interesting potential around urban air pollution though, industrial London was *significantly worse* than the horror pollution in parts of modern China.

  Assuming from "any living creature that he *touches*" that each creature must be an individual (i.e., no bacteria or virus modding, because I can think of a bunch of ways to ~~break~~ use that just off the top of my head), the first thing I would do is determine if I was included in that definition. This power gets broken if I'm allowed to, say, tie myself into an existing tree and exert influence on anything that tree is touching as well (possibly causing some cascading issues as I spread to everything that touches, and so on.). Also try to define "touch" - if I can make hairs grow and use contact through hair to alter something, I don't really need to move around - having flies carry strands of ever lengthening hair to spread my will across the jungle would work out well for me. 

  The next main focus is what process you can influence without actual knowledge of what they do. For instance, can you cause flies to develop the chemical system that would allow them to utilize bioluminescence without knowing how that system works? That could be a major limiter of his power - he only understands systems he has had contact with (and the understanding can be limited, as in the case of brains). So no "optimized" crops, just crops that can utilize strengths of different plant species when he modifies them.

  That being said, random ideas:
  1) I like the resource plants mentioned by a poster above. I was thinking something along the lines of plants that intake salt water and exhale fresh water and salt. Boom, easy water purification.

  2) Population control of endangered species - depending on control over reproductive systems, can help raise the numbers of dying species, as well as fixing any ecological damage to their habitats

  3) Speaking of repairing ecological damage, creating something that can process waste oil (both in water and on land) and either turn it into something useful or just transport it and excrete it somewhere it can be dealt with more appropriately.

  4) Algae biofuel. It's already a thing, one good push and it can replace petroleum.

  5) Species editing. The cattle population in Western civilization is facing increasing problems from artificial selection. They have been bred to be larger and larger, which causes many more deaths during childbirth as the calves are much larger than they should be. This is probably not the only species with these or similar problems, but it's the only one I can think of off the top of my head.

  6) Landfill destroyers. Probably several different species to handle plastic, glass, metal, etc.

  7) Worms that can improve soil quality, both for existing cropland and to convert useless soil into usable soil. Probably going to need specialized diets to excrete the proper chemicals, but that can be taken care of.

  8) Insect control - bye bye killer bees and giant hornets.

  Not sure how direct the touch needs to be but:

  1. It should be possible to create totipotent stem cells from adult somatic cells if you can directly modify genetics and cell structure with 100% accuracy.
  2. Similarly, cloning humans or anything else would be easy since you could easily reset all the epigenetics and do the transfer of the nucleus to the zygote without causing cell damage. 
  3. Undo some of the better-understood symptoms of ageing such as DNA damage to slow your ageing.
  4. Make yourself and others immune to diseases by producing the relevant antibodies within their bodies.
  5. Destroy pathogens from the bodies of people you come in contact with.
  6. Eliminate the well-understood genetic diseases from the people you come in contact with.
  7. For combat purposes, modify insects to have extremely deadly poisons and switch their scent receptors so that they perceive the smell of your enemy, or the smell of a chemical that you will tag your enemy with as a threat. Make yourself immune to the poisons. Sterilize any animals you genetically modify so that they can't reproduce. 
  8. Obviously, healing yourself and others of injuries and reviving dead people before they've started to decompose should be possible depending on the cause of death and how much time and knowledge of anatomy, medicine, etc. you have.

  A few ideas from a book I read a while back (Copernick's Rebellion, Leo Frankowski - not a very good book in many ways, and one I can't really recommend, but it had some ideas about people exploiting a higher level of genetic understanding and technological modification)

  - Tree houses: True-replicating trees of various sizes between small apartment to big multiperson family units that grow independently and can replace entire construction industry and possibly agricultural industry if they grow food (possessing room/furniture shaped internal structures)
  - Improved efficiency in plants: Augment transpiration process with a heart pushing sap around for vast efficiency gains over basic transpiration.
  - Insanely optimized fast-growing crops to feed world?
  - Carrot for negotiating with Government (esp. US gov't) - majority of politicians are old people, offer to reset politicians internal biology to mid-twenties to ward off heart disease, cancers, etc for another 50 years. Can't fix brain stuff e.g. Alzheimers, apparantly, but fixing everything from arthritis to cancer to impotency is a pretty big negotiating carrot. currently 60 of US Senate is over 60, a majority, so it might be quite feasible to block legislation at the very least.
  - Can you get something which can metabolize metals and extract from deep underground or filter metals out of ocean for initial wealth generation? Can you get an organism to shape carbon into diamond?
  - Ludicrously scary negotiating stick (probably best not to even mention and hope they don't realize you could wipe out the human race on accident by tinkering with virii and/or bacteria - otherwise any sensible government will probably assassinate them). 

  There was a bunch of other stuff that seemed really implausible or outright fantasy of course, and a bunch of stuff involving creating sentients designed to be subservient which is super morally problematic and also extremely dangerous when they started messing around with sentients smarter than baseline humans.

  Any sort of advance matter control and shaping power is best used an experimental tool for various theories. Saving the world with human protecting bacteria is good overall, but the greatest gain is in testing. Like material configuration testing, producing and testing chemistry reactions and producing computer chips of atomic dimensions.

    It'll probably be a while. I need to finish up my Superman fic, reread at least the first few books, draw up a general outline that works on a narrative level, and then set up a custom dictionary to write in the period properly. But unless the ideas all fall apart when I prod them, this will probably be the next thing that I work on. Luckily, Tarzan is in the public domain, so I could potentially sell it on Amazon for a dollar as well as putting it on ff.net.

    I've always liked the themes of Tarzan - the tension of animalistic nature against upright British society, for one.

- u/khafra:
  ```
  I think the physical side of this power is most precisely expressed as "changing a living creature in a way that isn't allowed by physics; but with an end product which is subject to physics." 

  A lot of uses will depend on the *mental* side of the power. In how much detail must I visualize the changes I'm making? Can I visualize pieces and then store them for modular use in larger visualizations? If not, the power probably won't be useful for much more than a single, unexpected assassination (or multiple assassinations of lower-profile targets), curing cancer, and "optimizing" people by eliminating their mutational load.
  ```

- u/Izeinwinter:
  ```
  Eh.. Starting with Tarzan makes.. limited.. sense If you want a character with control of biology, isn't this Poison Ivy's stichk? 

  That said, obvious uses :
  Step one: 
  Personal Safety: In remote locations, have patches of super-photosynthetic wine send down roots. Way down. No, further. Have the roots start operating of geothermal heat gradients, spread out and grow networked redundant backups of your brain. Archival only. Not actively running. Also grow neural nodes that are basically a non-volitional computer system.
   Protocol: If not updated for a month, send up root vine to grow new you. Sub protocol. If you meet yourself, retreat to the depths, preform merge. (branching identity is a bad, bad, bad no-good idea) 

  Step 2:
   Optimized to heck and gone crops. Standard photosynthesis is not very good, a directed effort should be able to improve on them. Add in atmospheric nitrogen harvesting.. Dont make these seed-bearing, or you just hit reset on the entire ecosystem. Perennials that only reproduce via cuttings are the way to go -super banana's, basically. 
  Step 3: 
  Cook up a mod for human biology that stops senescence improves healing mechanisms in general and puts reproduction under positive volitional control for both genders. As a package deal. Make this into a fruit of a tree (see earlier comment about seedless and cuttings) Yes, I did pick a tree just to mess with people. 

  Things not to do: Mods to own brain. This would be a really good way to die. Or go into vegetative blissout.

  Your first literary challenge will be to make all of these munchkinings too hard.  Two things I would try is the R-brain driving the changes.  Panacea wasn't a gamebreaker because her issues prevented here from using here power optimally.  If you are going to have a rationalist apply this power you should either gimp it, or make it a threat: what if the modified organisms are more prone to reversion because the DNA only affects some not all of the organism, or worse, they gain some amount of the power, and mutate optimally in single generations, mutate for their own reproduction a la potential grey goo scenarios.
  ```

- u/Charlie___:
  ```
  Recursive self-improvement. That's... probably not going to be allowed.

  If making heritable changes is possible, I think an easy route to power is agribusiness. Become Monsanto but bigger. One business model is to create crop that has extreme disease resistance, yield, nutritional value, but then to make it sterile in only a few generations so farmers buy seed from me, grow it, sell the product, and buy more seed. Alternate business model is to create a "lock and key" system, where a special fertilizer, pesticide, herbicide, or food source is needed for good yields, which I then sell. This would be good for livestock, e.g. modern chickens but more hardy, docile, and disease-resistant.

  For third-world markets, selling non-sterile but not-quite-as-good seed would be a good way to encourage the spread of a green revolution.

  This would lead to me making approximately all of the money, I'd probably need an island fortress of living oak, guarded by ferocious yet adorable capybaras.

  Also, the massive displacement of farmers and concentration of capital caused by less labor-intensive crops would cause workers revolts worldwide. I could probably take advantage of the chaos to, like, buy England.
