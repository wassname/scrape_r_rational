## Looking for a story

### Post:

I vaguely remember reading a story I think I found on here about a computer virus discovered by a team (of four?). The virus was highly pervasive and written in a non idiosyncratic way. The climax of the story was their realization that [spoiler](#s "the virus was evolving itself"). Does anyone remember what is was called?

    Unless of course, there is only one machine or machine hive mind, and it decides to optimize itself by deleting its memories of humans, who no longer matter cause they were foolish creatures who are all extinct anyway.
