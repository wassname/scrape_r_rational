## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  You now have "Inception Power." You can exert complete control over the content of people's dreams. Assume initially that there is no limit on your ability to exert this power: you can control the dreams of anyone or everyone in the world, as many times as you want. You can't exceed the normal range of physiological effects of dreams - for example, you can't overwrite people's minds, cause their hearts to stop if they are otherwise healthy, or force people to remember dreams that they would normally forget - but otherwise you have full control. (So for example, you could get people to remember a specific dream by turning the ending into a nightmare, forcing them to wake up early).

  What fun and interesting things can you do with this? Feel free to strengthen or weaken the power to give the most interesting results.

    It would give you lots of influence over religious leaders, since you can convince them that their deity told them to do something/not do something in a dream. Similarly for anyone particularly religious in a position of power.

    Aside from people liable to give credence to information or instructions in dreams, you could possibly subtly influence how people react by having them experience nightmares where whatever they had previously decided on goes horribly wrong. For a positive example, showing someone nightmares about a life of financial ruin because they got caught up in a pyramid scheme or time share.

    For influencing groups, you could cause some effect by giving huge numbers of people a very specific dream all at once. How would the world react to every single person in France having the exact same dream of a stock market crash, or a natural disaster? Like the effect literally stops at the border. It would be interesting to watch the analysis on that.

    Finally, you could give your friends/family/pets dreams of nice things you intend to do to them. Give your dog dreams of steak, and then give him one the next day.

    * It would be very easy to use the power to negatively affect people's mental health (e.g. horrific nightmares every night) which could be used to remove them from positions of power. However this would require the ability to be kept secret unless the target has no way of negatively affecting me
    * Selling good dreams to people would be an easy source of income, especially if I can target groups like "everyone who paid me online today"
    * The dreams could be used as inexpensive training, especially for dangerous situations that are hard to train for normally. If the power can induce lucid dreaming this would be even more effective
    * Having full control over people's perceptions could be a useful tool to treat mental problems
    * With unlimited group targeting ability I could eliminate negative dreams entirely from humanity, though this could have effects on mental development

      > Selling good dreams to people would be an easy source of income

      Yes! Once you've proved to the public that your power is legit, you'll be an overnight millionaire. Each time a purchase goes through, the customer gets a "dream token" specific to the dream they purchased. You can go through the list of dream tokens targeting the group of people who possess that token. The way I envision the power to work, it would be like this: you maintain a list of about 80 different dream storylines that people can purchase online. I say 80 because, assuming that it takes at most 3 minutes to use your power on one set of people for one dream storyline, you can work about 4 hours a day. You can have different subscription models, too. People can make one-time purchases for a higher price, or experience regular dreams for a monthly fee. You can rotate the dream storylines and put them into categories like adventure, lucid, sexual, etc. You can hire dream writers to make dream series with ongoing storylines. You can reserve some slots for high-paying clients who want to craft their own custom dream storylines.

      Aaaand now I want an actual story involving this, because this sounds awesome.
      ```

        You could write an interesting Death Note type story as long as The Dreamweaver kept their identity secret. They prove their powers to people by asking them what they want to dream, then making them dream it, all over the Dark Web, using numerous layers of security, and only communicating over free WiFi. Knowledge of your capabilities will spread rapidly, rapidly giving you a customer base and tons of money.

        Then, you start giving constant horrific nightmares to the leaders of terrorist and criminal organizations. Ideally, the content would be something like being tortured for as long as you can dilate time, by their chosen deities, in penance for their sins. Every time someone steps up to replace the gibbering mess of the old leader, the curse passes to them. Eventually, the organizations would implode for lack of leadership.

        This would get you in the good books of normals everywhere, but it would terrify all world governments. Once you start going political, you should cease all online communication with your customers. People can still make requests on a public forum, but you would have discretion. You'd probably grant dreams to, say, pedophiles asking for release in dreams, or other clear net-good situations. However, using dreams to communicate with people directly is dangerous because you would have to make sure your language can't be traced back to you, so all further dreams must only be for the purposes you set forth.

        From there, you start slowly nudging society into the shape you want, one nightmare (or absurdly pleasant dream) at a time. You never go after people in prisons with the nightmare campaigns, always leadership only, to minimize contact points and make it far harder for them to perform experiments on you.

        Of course, every intelligence agency everywhere is now on the hunt for you. You can avoid the Silkroad problem by never communicating electronically, but they might still be able to hack your former electronic communications. You have money now, so you can disappear in your current identity, get plastic surgery to look like someone else, and buy a nice house in a sleepy town somewhere.

    Set up an online store selling some self-help ebook.  Buy high ad placement just for 1 day, tomorrow.  Then, targeting people in first-world countries, send them dreams of clicking on my book ad and living lives of luxury and success.  The next morning, a ton of these people will see this exact ad on Facebook, Google, etc.  They recognize it, and a reasonable percentage, 5%? buy it.  Tada, millions of dollars.

    Even better alternative, if you have time: Start marketing agency.  Refuse to specify your methods, contracts pay you a % of sales difference between last year and this year.  Very cheap, so people will take the risk.  When hired, start giving a random 1% of target market dreams of this amazing product each night.  Within a year, get a reputation for being mysterious but highly effective.  Again, make millions.

      My intent with the "feel free to strengthen or weaken" sentence was to allow you to make up your own answer to this, and proceed from there.

      I'm assuming by default that you do not have superintelligent enhancement when using the power, just your own ordinary intelligence. You can target sets of people that you can coherently specify in your mind. For example, you can target everyone, or a specific person, or people on a specific continent, or people of a specific gender, etc. (the power takes care of fuzzy edge cases for you automatically, but not necessarily in a way that you would approve of). As for dream content, you can spend some time crafting a story that's as elaborate as you want, and then each dreamer fills in the rest of the details. You can form a queue of dreams: e.g., "Group 1 dreams X tonight, group 2 dreams Y tonight." Each use of the power on a group takes a few minutes to complete, so the limit on this queueing is your own mental exhaustion.

  **Reverse Munchkin: Probability control**

  A character in my RPG universe might come to be at odds with the players. How can they beat this guy?

  * Can control probability to nigh incalculable degrees. Can make something astronomically improbable a certainty by mere will alone. This has a limit, which is his own awareness. As an example, he can stir his finger in a cup of room temperature water, coalesce all of the coldest molecules into ice cubes, then remove the ice cubes leaving a cup of hot water behind.
  * Can see all probable outcomes of any event out to some arbitrary deviation, say z=10.
  * Can impose superpositions on the macro scale; can be in multiple places at once, doing multiple things at once. This has no spatial limit - can be anywhere in the universe of which the character is aware. Each superposition of himself is aware of everything each superposition is doing. His abilities maintain full potency with each superposition, though there is a limit to how many he can maintain at once (he is not infinitely aware).
  * He is hundreds of millions of years old and leads the most powerful intergalactic civilization in the observable universe. He is extremely experienced, extremely intelligent, and has almost limitless resources.
  ```

  - u/neondragonfire:

    Memetics. Design an idea that destroys his mind. That should take care of the superposition, since you just need to get one of him in order to kill all of him.

    Or instead of killing him rewrites him to be friendly towards the party. After all, why waste such a useful individual?
    ```

    - u/SirRaiuKoren:
      ```
      Hm . . . that's actually a good idea. The players have access to magic that can alter someone's mind. Since each superposition uses the same mind, any mental exploit executed on one of them will affect them all.

      He is cosmically well versed in magic, but he definitely isn't immune. It would be risky, but this could actually work.

    Sniper. If he doesn't know he's being shot at, he can't control the situation.
    ```

    - u/SirRaiuKoren:
      ```
      How do you know it wasn't a superposition? That might just take out one position, and the other positions become immediately aware that position has been sniped. Or killed, in any case.

      But you are correct, if he was not aware of the shot, he could not stop it.

    That's a lot of options to choose from.

    Blink seems like it would be good regardless of what you're doing. Dodging an attack, getting past an obstacle, teleporting behind someone. The long range teleport would only be good if there's no good transportation technology.

    Mind blank seems like it is essentially required. A single skill to block an entire section of offensive abilities? Simple choice. If you want an offensive ability in the mind magic tree, fury seems like it would be good. Otherwise it's a weak tree if it's so easily blocked.

    The two shield abilities are necessary for anyone who might want to go into combat. Absorption seems extremely useful for everyone, because it hard counters lots of abilities and then you have additional offensive options. It also allows you to use an ally's abilities if they cast a spell on you for you to use later.

    Self healing seems like another necessary skill to learn.

    Telekinetic hand seems really good. Reach things that are too far away, grab things in dangerous location, slap/strangle someone from a distance. Really good utility from a single spell.

    I'm really unsure on directly offensive magic. Way too many choices with not enough detail. Given the way the shield magic works, I think simple and highly recastable magics are the best. You can exhaust their defensive options before you run out yourself. Extremely destructive magics would be highly situational.

    I think this list needs to be rebalanced and cut down a lot. For one thing, some abilities take too long to learn for the given college style curriculum. Self healing is 2 years, healing touch another three, and then there are abilities that have healing touch as a prerequisite? You need to attend an additional year just to learn the first move that heals someone else. There are other spells that are 3 years to learn and have a two year spell as a prerequisite. Second, some of these spells are obviously not useful or just completely not worth the opportunity cost. Two years for freshness? The memo spell? Unearth? Grow tentacles? Seeing in the dark is an okay ability that can be made obsolete by someone bringing a torch or flashlight. Throwing lightning bolts isn't. Remove the redundant and mostly useless spells, and you'd have a much more manageable list, because some spells simply aren't worth the investment given the costs and other options.
    ```

    - u/IntPenDesSwo:
      ```
      Nice work! Uh, you can choose a total of 32 volumes, so you don't need to worry about extra years until after that. Each spell takes an eighth of a year only. 

      I'll add some ideas of my own when I have time.
      ```

      - u/sicutumbo:
        ```
        Oh, I must have misread it. Looks like each volume uses a single semester, not a year. That still makes simulacrum use up more than 4 years given the prerequisite, but I think it's the only one like that.

        Given the way that the defensive magic seems to work, I think the best combo against human mages is strength plus telekinetic hand. Become stronger, then punch people at range. Both spells have unlimited use, so you can pretty quickly exhaust all their defenses. After that, mobility is all that can be used as a defense, and there aren't that many mobility spells.

        Edit: Nevermind, the time stop spell and deport object are both monstrously overpowered. Blink plus time stop gives you a few unobstructed seconds to attack someone from above or behind. Deport object means you can teleport a bomb behind their shield.

    * Alert
    * Guardian Spirit
    * Guardian Spirit 
    * Guardian Spirit

    Semester Two

    * Living Shadow
    * Living Shadow
    * Light
    * Illusion

    Semester Three

    * After Images
    * Holding Space
    * Holding Space
    * Crashing Wave

    Semester Four

    * Night Eyes
    * Eagle Eyes
    * Mind Blank
    * Mind Blank

    Semester Five

    * Might
    * Might
    * Grace
    * Grace

    Semester Six

    * Haste
    * Haste
    * Toughness
    * Toughness

    Semester Seven

    * Endure Elements
    * Endure Elements
    * Water Breathing
    * Water Walking

    Semester Eight

    * Telekinetic Hand
    * Telekinetic Hand
    * Unseen Hands
    * Unseen Hands

    This build: is permanently guarded by both an animated shadow and guardian spirit augmented by alertness and excellent vision, has a full suite of permanent body enhancements, is capable of surviving comfortably in most environments both on land and aquatic, is capable of traveling quickly over water via Water Walking and Crashing Wave, is capable of attacking at short range via telekinetically wielded daggers drawn from a holding space and obscured via bright lights and covering illusions, and is difficult to attack via non-homing means thanks to the combination of after images and covering illusions.

    Major weaknesses I've noticed include a lack of teleportation to escape from binds or traps, and a lack of antimagic or shields to counter attacks that the baffles don't stop.

  You have the ability to switch minds with people. In order to do this you must be touching the person (skin contact or better) and you must will for it to happen (so you can't accidentally switch). The ability works by instantly overwriting the connections in the brain, therefore if the target doesn't have a similar enough brain structure for your mind to be accurately replicated (e.g. has had parts of their brain removed or has a mental disease) then the ability won't work. The ability is also transferred with your mind. How do you best utilize this?

    Personally, I'm in the "a copy is not the original" school and as nice as it might be to imagine a sequence of versions of myself living on in other bodies, a murder/suicide pair every time I use this power is quite discouraging.

    Ignoring that, this is still a *very* difficult power to use in morally sound ways. If you swap forever only to people who consent completely, the advantages are largely in how the change allows deception on your part or theirs. If they don't consent, the situation gets monstrous fast... as you have to figure out how to either overpower your old body or restrain it beforehand.

    At best, I suppose, you can facilitate permanent swaps between consenting people who want to relieve whatever complementary dysphorias they possess.
