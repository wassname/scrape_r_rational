  ```
  An interesting one-shot where the protagonist lives in a world where anyone can summon demons. This story is about her decision to sell her soul and why.

  I stumbled on this story while looking through past Friday threads and it looked interesting enough to share.

    ```
    Not as good as the star-gate development notes, but I was tearing up with laughter by the end.  

    I kind of wonder if this is what happens when a Type-II Civilization leaves a real words interface to call them up in their virtuality and a running joke goes too far.
