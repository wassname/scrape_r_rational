    There's a note on chapter 36, apparently these haven't been edited yet. The editor is sick and the translator just decided to post them anyway and let him edit them later.
    ```

  - u/strivon:
    ```
    got it
    ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    If they do they should know the page that lists all chapters is broken. Hasn't been updated since 34.
    ```

    - u/strivon:
      ```
      fixed
      ```

      ```
      Yeah, I kept checking for new chapters and being disappointed because I would just look at that page.
