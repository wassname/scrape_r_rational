  So it seems like it would be better not to include Silverlake in future attempts at getting all the artifacts, because Alanic was surprisingly effective at fighting QI, who will be a huge challenge to get past. I'm not totally clear on what benefit Silverlake gives for getting the pieces of the key. Traps for QI maybe, but Zorian is better at wards than her so she won't be much help for the dagger. If the sun Temple is a straightforward combat challenge, losing the use of Alanic would be rather harmful.

  For defending the Pearl, I think Zach is much better than Zorian for taking down opposing ships. Artillery spells arent always optimal because of how slow they are. For Zach, he can now make simulacra that can teleport. Simply have a simulacrum teleport on top of the airship, and fire piercing artillery spells down on it. Losing one of Zach's simulacra doesn't matter too much because they are the ectoplasm kind, and thus don't represent as large an investment of resources as Zorian's.

  This could be a rather good tactic for a couple different situations. Have a simulacra start casting a huge artillery spell, and then teleport it to wherever you want a crater to be instead of an opponent just before it finishes. Or just load it down with alchemical bombs for a similar effect. Might not work if they're not willing to suicide themselves though.

    Well judging from the last line of the chapter - we also don't know whether Silverlake will be even more effective at fighting QI than Alanic was...
    ```

      ```
      Yeah, I'm excited to see what she knows about liches. Kael knew enough to make a coin that broke QI's  connection to his body, which is amazing. I fully expect Silverlake to have some very interesting tricks up her sleeve!
      ```

  - u/-Fender-:
    ```
    To be fair, Alanic's problem seemed to only really be about breaking into the royal treasury. Well, that and working with Silverlake, but he could probably stand doing the latter if her presence is minimal. So Z&Z could probably still have Alanic's cooperation in facing Quatach, once they're done with the other business he considers unpleasant.
    ```

  - u/sambelulek:
    ```
    Hey, I just realize that introducing Silverlake to the group bound to make her know about time limit Z&Z is laboring under. I wonder how the plot will develop.

    Silverlake is your highly capable yet highly annoying member of the conspiracy. The default attitude toward her is to not involve her at group ops. But this theft, and its subsequent operations, is big deal. It's discourteous to left anybody out, so Zorian and Zach willing to give her a chance. This is the first, is it not? So yeah, without immense contribution later on, Z&Z might won't bother to involve her again.  

    > Have a simulacra start casting a huge artillery spell, and then teleport it to wherever you want a crater to be instead of an opponent just before it finishes. Or just load it down with alchemical bombs for a similar effect.  

    I don't believe I understand this sentence. Artillery spell is devastating (no point for additional alchemical bomb there), but require static target. Do you suggest using dimensional gate so that it can hit moving large objects like airplane? Zorian's simulacrum stated that even 'just' teleporting between moving platform is challenging. I imagine the difficulty of operating dimensional passage would be insurmountable.
    ```

    - u/Veedrac:
      ```
      > Artillery spell is devastating [...], but require static target.

      Why do you think it requires a static target?

      I believe the teleport idea was for one simulacra to teleport the other, though firing it through a sufficiently sized dimensional gate (again opened by a different simulacrum) sounds just as feasible.
      ```

      - u/sambelulek:
        ```
        It seems the maxim of MoL is the more punch a spell packed, the less maneuverable it would be. Teleport spell is to move oneself to new location, so targeting artillery spell beneath own's two feet after a teleport would make it a suicide bombing. I wonder if Zach still has suicide tendency.
        ```

        - u/Ardvarkeating101:
          ```
          Not if you're teleporting say, 50 feet above a target, release the spell, and then teleport back
          ```

          - u/throwawayIWGWPC:
            ```
            Agreed. Alternatively, fire into a dimensional gate that, for example, opens up on some important part of the ship.

            My guess, though, is that these airships are magically protected to be able to take artillery magic to a degree, so teleporting aboard and wrecking shit from the inside is more feasible.

            "Well, simulacrum two opened a hole in the hull."

            The shielding could defend against massive attacks but not weak ones---essentially like a *non-Newtonian fluid*.

            Edit: Science derp.

    ```
    > I'm not totally clear on what benefit Silverlake gives for getting the pieces of the key.

    I guess ideally you keep her around to constantly bounce dimensional ideas off of. Because the end game is still to get 2 souls out of this pocket. The key is just one part of that.
    ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    We donâ€™t know much about her combat ability, but if she is as capable as Alanic, it might not be that big of a loss if you lose him but gain her. 

    My guess is though Alanic would be better in combat, so it would be bad, in that sense I agree with you, just wanted to state the possibility.
    ```

- u/xachariah:
  ```
  >He kind of has to [break into the Royal Vaults], doesn't he?

  Does he?  

  It seems like breaking and entering is the path of most resistance.  Why not diplomatically groundhog attack the royal family instead of breaking into the vaults?

  I don't see why the royal family would be an order of magnitude more difficult to convince than Silverlake or Xvim or the Aranea (who cost multiple entire cycles each), and nothing is saying that they have to stop trying to break in while they convince the royal family.  The royal family is the most likely of anyone to have time-traveler-contingency-codes and is also far more useful for getting things done once they're convinced.  It seems like something that that Zach Noveda, Last of House Noveda, Prodigy Archmage, Slayer of the Dragon Oganj could be able to pull off with enough tries. 

  Their current 8+ man party is good, but an entire nation is a hell of a lot better.

  -----

  Similarly, it seems odd that they haven't tried to use diplomancy on QI at all.  They know it can be done since RR did it, and it would open up huge capabilities for backstabbing QI.  Yes, he is very very very scary, but talking to him is not much more risky than the Aranea mindbreaking Zorian before he learned mind magic or how they're trusting Silverlake right now.  

  As the Ghost Serpent and Silverlake and the Aranea and literally everyone else they've ever opened up to has mentioned, it is a literally unbeatable tactic.  And unlike the Ghost Serpent who wants nothing they have to offer, QI is making a very desperate and expensive gambit right now and could use all the help he can get.
  ```

  - u/throwawayIWGWPC:
    ```
    The aranea are not known to be openly aggressive without provocation and Zorian didn't fully understand the nature of the risk back then.

    Silverlake is also not openly malicious. I don't think she'd mangle the soul of a kid for telling her a tall tale.

    On the other hand, QI could utterly twist their soul on a whim and he just might. He is utterly terrifying. Who knows what he'd see if he had time to causally look at the soul of a controller? What if he looked at Zorian's soul? Would he notice scarring that makes him think he caused the scarring?

    No, I think befriending QI is a huge risk.
    ```

    - u/xachariah:
      ```
      Quatach-Ichl is *also* a highly respected, rational, heavily competent leader of a country who has already been shown to treat his subordinates fairly, work with timetravelers, and balance diplomatic concerns.

      Silverlake literally tried to kill Zorian for the lulz after he finisher her first apprenticeship task, and she can soul damage them all the same.

      QI is a big risk, but since they can now reset the time loop instantly or even negotiate via simulacra, he's not much more of a risk.  It's probably less of a risk in absolute terms to try to talk to him than to face him in battle.
      ```

      - u/throwawayIWGWPC:
        ```
        > Silverlake literally tried to kill Zorian for the lulz after he finisher her first apprenticeship task, and she can soul damage them all the same.

        Nah, there's no way a normal teenager would attempt to kill a grey hunter after reading up on it. And there's no way a normal teenager would intentionally find a grey hunter without learning about it first. If the teenager is dumb, then yeah, Silverlake made a dick move. However, like me, she probably doubted a dumb teenager would have been able to find her in the first place.

        And if Zorian was a looper as he claimed, then fighting a grey hunter isn't actually that dangerous.

        And yes, she could soul damage them, but so could Alanic. They put a *lot* of trust in him because he seems okay. Kael had recommended Silverlake to Zorian, so they probably view her as annoying but not life- or soul-threatening.

        As for using simulacra to talk to QI, I don't think that's any safer. Simulacra are still attached to the owner's soul.

        I don't know; I just feel parlay with QI is incredibly dangerous, even more dangerous than facing him in battle where QI is more likely to be too busy to examine their souls up close.

        However, you make a good point that Red Robe did it without fear. But maybe they knew each other from before the loop and so RR was comfortable enough with it.

          > she probably doubted a dumb teenager would have been able to find her in the first place. 

          I'm going to assume you're referring to the first time she appeared to Zorian. Wasn't it revealed in recent chapters that she did that because Zorian had killed a giant salamander, which was one of the ingredients for her potion of youth? You do have a point about a teenagers trying to kill grey hunters though.

          A dumb teenager can get a letter telling where she is and instinctively blow the head off a giant monster about to eat him.  There's nothing inherently intelligent about that.  Silverlake = Ultimate Dick
          ```

          - u/throwawayIWGWPC:
            ```
            Nah, using magic like that means he's a mage and so he's definitely going to research the spider before going after it. She probably didn't even think he'd find it in the first place.

            - u/Ardvarkeating101:

              Zach's a mage, and he wouldn't, at least before the time loop

              - u/Keshire:
                ```
                Even during the time loop, he basically brute forced the dragon and died a whole bunch of times.
                ```

                - u/throwawayIWGWPC:
                  ```
                  That's because he is in a time loop and can't permanently die to dragons. We don't actually know how much research and planning went into killing that dragon. Zach is brazen, but he's not a complete dunce.

                  Plus, when he took on that dragon, he had something like 40 years of experience in the loop. You can't extrapolate the behavior of some random teenage mage-in-training based on the actions of an immortal archmage that can save-scum; it's apples to oranges.
                  ```

                - u/Ardvarkeating101:
                  ```
                  Exactly.  Being a mage means you got sent to a fancy school and maybe paid close attention a couple of times while writing the bare minimum you needed to not fail.  That's all it requires.
                  ```

              - u/throwawayIWGWPC:
                ```
                Assume it's pre-loop. How would Zach find the grey hunter without research, including asking someone about it? And I really doubt once he found out what he was up against, he'd not go near it. Remember, loop Zach is so brazen because he can't die.
                ```

                - u/Ardvarkeating101:
                  ```
                  > How would Zach find the grey hunter without research, including asking someone about it?

                  Yes.  That is exactly what Zach would do.  He doesn't like studying, barely passed, and honestly doesn't give a shit, even without time loop.  He seemed near suicidal when talking about his life pre-loop; he'd given up.
                  ```

                  - u/throwawayIWGWPC:
                    ```
                    We'll just have to agree to disagree.

                    Depression is unlikely make a teenager trapeze through the woods hunting stuff and looking for a witch so he can beg her for help with soul magic, spend time as the witch's apprentice, then go kill himself attacking a spider he wouldn't be able to find in the first place to do research.

                    Case in point, pre-loop why wasn't Zach going around adventuring like a daredevil? Because he was barely even a mage who was struggled to even keep up and was probably suffering from depression.

                    But there's something I keep forgetting to mention: Silverlake spent time with Zorian and could observe his temperament. I'd wager this influenced her decision.

                    She may be self-interested, but I don't think she'd send an innocent person to their death for absolutely no reason. I think she honestly thought he'd abandon the project as soon as he learned what a grey hunter was.
                    ```

    - u/CeruleanTresses:
      ```
      Could they get one of their allies to negotiate with QI on their behalf? Even if QI fucked up that person's soul, they'd still be fine outside the time loop.
      ```

      - u/throwawayIWGWPC:
        ```
        Yeah, that may be doable. But who are you going to convince to negotiate with QI? Doesn't hurt to ask though.

        But if QI knows enough mind magic to rip out answers, it could compromise ZZ anyhow.
        ```

        - u/CeruleanTresses:
          ```
          Theoretically, someone who's in on the time loop might be willing to do it on the grounds that this version of themselves is ultimately doomed anyway. 

          QI stealing information is a concern, but Zorian is probably creative enough to set up a way to know that it happened in time for him and Zach to kill themselves before QI got to them. With adequate precautions, it wouldn't be the worst idea to spend a restart or two trying it out, since it could easily take multiple restarts to defeat him and take the crown anyway. 

          Unless soul damage persists across time loops even for people other than ZZ, in which case they'd risk "permanently" sacrificing a useful ally. I forget how that works.
          ```

          - u/throwawayIWGWPC:
            ```
            I think the group should definitely discuss that approach. And as far as soul damage goes AFAIK it isn't permanent for non-loopers; loopers are the only ones whose souls persist across restarts.
            ```

  - u/Nickoalas:
    ```
    QI is too dangerous to deal with. Zach and Zorian aren't invincible. It would only take one mistake and soul magic can still take them out permanently.
    ```

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    The Royal family would be much harder to contact than eg Silverlake, would require extensive background checks etc before dealing with them, would not really need most of what ZZ have to offer - especially for such an important national treasure - and would likely take all kinds of other disruptive actions if they knew much. Such as throwing ZZ into research cells.
    ```

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    Why would QI have any interest in helping ZZ? Their objectives are opposed.

    RR could just drop off a packet of names, dates, secret passages, passwords, etc, and let them confirm that it's correct and useful for the invasion, since that's what the Ibasans were already doing. But if ZZ want them to do anything other than invade gud, then QI will want much more explanation. And when he gets it, why would he cooperate?

      You could even use the orb to transport it, then deploy it over a target and teleport away while it runs out to attack the "intruders".

  ```

- u/Cheese_Ninja:
  ```
  That was one of my main guesses for Alanic's past. Silverlake likes to actively antagonize people, I'm surprised she can get away with making so many enemies while being so long lived, but I suppose she can deal with any aggression that comes her way.

  I assume Zorian used a mental restructuring on simulacra 2? That sort of dispassionate killing of relative innocents doesn't seem like his usual self.

  - u/Ardvarkeating101:
    ```
    > I assume Zorian used a mental restructuring on simulacra 2? That sort of dispassionate killing of relative innocents doesn't seem like his usual self.

    Why would he have had to do that?  He's killed people before, and dragon cult or not killing people is generally necessary when stealing the most valuable artifacts on the planet.  I don't think he even *can* do that with the simulcrums, certainly we've never seen any evidence of him doing it.
    ```

    - u/cathemeralman:
      ```
      Agreed. It's not like Zorian is doing this in cold blood either. They are actively trying harm him and thwart their heist.
      ```

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    Do you recall how Alanic criticised Zorian for merely stunning the group of men who attacked him?

    Until Zorian explained that that was simply his most practical attack method, and the backup plan was large numbers of explosives.

    He's always been pragmatic, and the loop would only reinforce that.
    ```

  - u/sambelulek:
    ```
    It is implied that Alanic in the past was like Zorian just some restart ago; seeking help from Silverlake when he himself powerless. Imagine meeting a stoic and priest_y_ guy you once known as boy full of angst, the temptation to tease him would be immense!!
    ```

- u/DerSaidin:
  ```
  >  still remember how you came to me back then, a budding little necromancer full of ambition and anger... A necromancer and a thief became a fervent priest and a patriot

  I suspect Alanic's reform included submitting to some kind of magically enforced oath of service to the church/good/law. They (the church or the state or whoever) allowed this because they could see how useful Alanic (including all necromancy knowledge) would be on the side of the law.


  This would explain why Alanic is trusted to command such resources; because he is highly competent and the magical oath gives strong assurance he is acting for the common good. Alanic is like a Lensman of the MoL universe.
  ```

  - u/Dragrath:
    ```
    This is actually a good possibility I didn't consider and would explain why he said things the way he did regarding not being around while they talk about such things even if he understands their desperation. 
    That said earlier he heard that magical oaths have become more or less useless in the modern era of magic as modern magic's versatility makes it far to easy to override them.
    But considering the nature of the power base the royals and church no doubt have,  oaths might still be of value to them for select individuals they wish to keep on a leash as with their resources they may be able to check that those people are still under an oath.
    Thus it may be that if this is the case the royals are a group he literally can not oppose.
    I'm not sure this is the case but the idea itself is quite interesting.

  Is there some kind of reference for the collection of spells and tricks ZZ have access to? I was doing a quick scan through the story for another reason and found one which temporarily turns stone to liquid that I had totally forgotten about. Also autonomous paper planes. Makes you wonder what else there is.

    We've never had one for Zach and the number of spells Zorian knew about and told us about was outpaced pretty fast, around the time he started learning divination from that cop I believe.  They're both archmages, it would fill literal bookshelves with all the spells they know.

  So conflict between Silverlake and Alanic huh they certainly are the sort of characters where I thought there might be tension/distrust between but I didn't expect outright conflict to be their reaction there is definitely a colorful history there. 
  Both are useful allies and probably essential to pull off the escape(Silverlake especially if the keys don't work)
  But Alanic is probably right that Silverlake isn't really trustworthy(even if I suspect his views are somewhat tinted by past dealings with her) she is definitely looking for anything she can use as extra leverage and her secret coded notes definitely contain secrets. I suspect like the Spider queen from the early on(I can't remember their title/name been too long:P )She will want to do something beyond what she says such as looking to escape the loop as well or perhaps to sneakily get something she hasn't been able to get before abusing the loop. After all she is a very crafty one... I still remember the Grey Hunter. >_> 

  That said Alanic may be out regarding the treasury heist but he still seems to be amiable to the rest but that part will definitely need some extra care during the heist if they go that route. That said I'm not convinced the royals can't be reasoned with, assuming they could convince them in a reasonable time table that is, which would be a gamble so I  can see why it might be a problem here

  As for the airship that was an interesting jacking with lots of room for improvement though I am skeptical that it will be as useful in raiding the royal treasury as they seem to think right now. I would certainly prefer to deal with QI than that place as you at least have some idea what your dealing with there where as the royal treasury carries a very high unknown risk given the extreme degree of paranoia proofed defenses they seem to have yeah I'd only go for that after the others.
  Well thanks for the Chapter nobody103! :)

    Maybe I'm misunderstanding your comment. Unless I missed something in the chapter, there are no plans to use the airship to rob of the royal treasury. The airship is to get them through the Xlotic Desert and, in another restart, to Blantyre (sp).

    You're right though: The airship would be totally useless in robbing the royal treasury. A legion or highly skilled mages riding eagles could very easily out-maneuver the airship.

  Alanic probably was born with spirit eyes, or whatever the rare but naturally occurring version of soul sight was called. He can clearly use unstructured necromancy, sees soul sight in general as a great temptation, and said that it was "different" that he had soul sight when Zorian asked about it.
  ```

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    Maybe, but I suspect it's more "I recognise that I was making lots of awful mistakes when I gave myself soul sight."

    After all, an ambitious young necromancer's quest for power is rather "different" to a young man seeking protection from soul attacks after suffering through one.
    ```

  - u/AKAAkira:
    ```
    Given that in chapter 31, Zorian noted that one of Alanic's eyes are brown while the other is blue with a scar over it that made it seem like it should have destroyed the eye, I think it's implied even if it's not confirmed that Alanic's soul sight came from taking someone else's eye and putting it into his own eye socket.

    Now that I think about it, seems like a reference to Kakashi from Naruto.
    ```

    - u/scalymonster:
      ```
      I don't think that would work to give someone soul sight. It's stated in chapter 75 that it "isn't really sight as such, so much as a whole new sense" so it wouldn't be bound to the eye at all. Also it would've been brought up at some point if soul sight could be gained by such a simple method, and it hasn't.
      ```

      - u/AKAAkira:
        ```
        Oh, point. I didn't consider that aspect.

        There's definitely a story behind that eye though, and the way Alanic reacted "uncomfortably" when he said the situation when he got his soul sight was different indicates he wasn't just born with it. But I guess they probably aren't as connected as I thought.

  I do believe this is the first time Zorian has gone around casually killing people who weren't either evil or hired to do something evil. Interesting that neither the characters nor the narrator seem to make a big deal about it?
  ```

  - u/WadeSwiftly:
    ```
    What about the Aranea that Zach and Zorian murdered?
    ```

    - u/eroticas:
      ```
      Oh yeah I forgot about them. Although, didn't Zorian have rather more moral deliberation about doing that? (and it was noted that Zorian instinctively didn't have the same aversion to it, due to them not appearing human - killing a human represents a deeper blunting of instinctual prohibitions against killing people for Zorian, even though the Aranea are people so it's morally equivalent)

      So correction - this is the first time Zorian is killing people who aren't either evil, hired by someone evil, or non-human persons. 

      The only instinctive-moral barrier left for him is attacking non-combatants (and barely even that - because both the Arana and the airship defenders were primarily acting in defense of territory and material resources. So they arguably only became "combatants" because Zorian sort of forced them to be combatants, which is an awful lot like attacking non-combatants. It's not the *same* thing because attacking someone's resources and then lethally defending yourself against their retaliation is very different from directly lethally attacking an otherwise peaceful person's body, but it's definitely getting closer and closer to the edge.)

        > and it was noted that Zorian instinctively didn't have the same aversion to it, due to them not appearing human

        I believe it was Zach not Zorian who felt that way---until Zorian told Zach that the aranea would beg for their lives or what have you.
        ```

        >'s not the same thing because attacking someone's resources and then lethally defending yourself against their retaliation is very different from directly lethally attacking an otherwise peaceful person's body, but it's definitely getting closer and closer to the edge.

        This is a good point. I still feel the ends justify the means here. I don't think either of them finds it good to kill innocent people.
        ```

  - u/throwawayIWGWPC:
    ```
    I disagree with it being casual murder. When they stole the ship, they tried not to kill anybody. When they were forced to fight, however, it was a matter of self-defense and ensuring a successful mission. If they can't accomplish their various missions, they may not exit the loop, the primordial might be released in the real world, possibly hundreds of thousands will perish. Plus, they know these people will not permanently die.
    ```

    - u/eroticas:
      ```
      Oh I don't mean that it was casual murder, only that Zorian's previous reluctance to do things he would not morally permit himself to do outside the time loop is perhaps eroding.
      ```

      - u/throwawayIWGWPC:
        ```
        Maybe your right, and nobody103 kind of made a point of Zorian#2 pausing for a moment after killing the skater mage, perhaps calling our attention to the moral significance of the event.

        However, I don't think he'd kill dozens of aranea for practice outside of the loop though. Or hunt dozens of wolves just to skin them and sell the pelts without concern for wasting food. And those things occurred a very long time ago. So, he's definitely been willing to do *some* morally 
        questionable things that he wouldn't do outside of the loop.
        ```

  - u/thefreegod:
    ```
    It should be mentioned that a simulatra is doing the killing.  It does not have to worrying about how his will change him.  His memories will disappear soon.  Most of Zorian arguments about doing bad things in a time loop are worries that it will change him.  Simulatra manage to give distance form the act.
    ```

- u/Gurkenglas:

  > Though, since Zach and his simulacrums were largely identical in mind, it should be quite possible for him to use telepathy to communicate with his copies with ease, even if he wasn't a natural mind mage like Zorian.

  - u/sambelulek:
    ```
    I feel developing alternative way to escape the time loop by mastering dimensional magic is an important sub-plot. I think several chapters dedicated to developing that plot is well worth it. I am very satisfied with idea of butchered primordial turned toy revealed to Zorian. But I get that sometimes people want one plot to be stubbornly pursued.  

    The thing about gathering keys tho, if author want it to be a failure, Zorian would left without plan B. Then we will spend quite sometimes to develop another way out. If author want it to be a complete success, it would be cheap. You see, all your plan working out is not a great way to build a story. I really like what author has done so far, a mostly successful operations with some inevitable complications.  

    See emperor orb ops as example. It's laden with baggages: killed expedition members creating a tense situation, Daimen get grounded, highly involvement of Taramatula estate, revelation of Kazinski family history and motive, and revelation of Fortov's issue. I missed some there, but the point is, while they build a complete picture, they add to the previously developed sub-plots. I think it's worthy of praise.
    ```

    - u/throwawayIWGWPC:
      ```
      I agree 100%, maybe 200%---I relish the subplots to the point where I'd love chapters describing a lot of more of the studies and training in detail. But I know very well that people are dying for the plot to move forward.
      ```

- u/DCarrier:

  I didn't think the justification for ship-shaped airships made much sense. If it's really so hard to build an airship, you'd think they'd consider it vital to keep it light and not use an already-built boat just to save a little time and money.

  A better reason would be so that they can sail when they're on the ocean and between ley lines.
  ```

  - u/sicutumbo:
    ```
    Making an airship isn't the hard part. Making an economical one is. It makes some sense to use a design with an industry behind it already, and all the experience in making such ships, to lower the R&D cost of making new ships.

    Also, surviving a landing in the ocean to then drown would kind of suck.

    I noticed nobody103 used brackets for subordinate thought and em/en dash if it's in speech form. the dash worked better in this chapter, but I'm more partial to ye olde comma and period. Not merely a discourse in taste, but since the very start, Mother of Learning style of narration seems to favor simple sentences one line of thought at a time. In fact, only lately I feel there were a number of side remarks. I think simple-sentence is a very good style; readers digested them easily and author would be quite challenged to translate multiple line of thought into simple straightforward passage.
