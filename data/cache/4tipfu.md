  As always with Dinosaur Comics, don't forget the following after you've read the strip:

  [Mouseover Title Text](#s " real talk: the secret to writing is to have friends who are better at writing than you")

  [Contact Link Email Subject](#s " can we vote for hari seldon?  i want ebenezer scrooge to pull a hari seldon and allow earth to fall, so that a the new earth could rebuild faster")

  [RSS Entry Title Text](#s " i... may be kinda obsessed with my new improved ebenezer scrooge")
  ```
