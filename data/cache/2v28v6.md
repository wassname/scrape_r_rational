## [D][Q] The Tragedy of General Zod

### Post:

Am I the only one who feels an utter tragedy is at play in the character of general Zod as depicted in man of steel?

As near as I can surmise from the cues of the fiction, he is a human like being, who by conditioning and or genetic pre-disposition been given a degree of scope insensitivity for the well being of his people and the preservation of his society.

There is so much heroism I see in his journey, he strives to overthrow a government that he see's has FAILING to save his people from certain destruction. His rebellion fails, but what he is trying to prevent ends up happening!

Then when by a miracle of infrastructure failure he and his few survivors are released from their imprisonment he, a human like being that is MEANT to feel the weight of such an event see's the destruction of all he exists to protect.

And then instead of giving up he manages to scrounge a plan to MAYBE find some SHRED of his people's survival.

And then he finds this traitor of everyone and everything he cares about, who is intrinsicly containing thesalvation of EVERYTHING he wants to protect.

And even a surviving means to bring back EVERYTHING about krypton that he feels as an aching loss and it's RIGHT there and this infant, this child who contains everything to restore the ONLY THING he ever was meant to protect.

Just...

There is such a terrible tragedy in this.

The conflict honestly feels surprisingly rational to me, I feel like it would have been a better narrative if they had dropped more of the trappings of the source material (like superman's weakness to kryptonian atmosphere).

Am I alone in having gotten this from the film?

  There were a lot of things that could have been done to make that movie better, and a lot of things that could have made it more rational.

  * Make it so that the terraforming ship is damaged in such a way that it's not going to be able to move to another planet - it's terraform Earth or bust, which at least means that Zod has some incentive other than being a total dick.
  * Have Zod make some token attempt at compromise before going psycho.
  * Have Zod make a token attempt at trickery (a legitimate military tactic).
  * Actually include some fallout from the near-total destruction of Metropolis. The Avengers at least made a token effort at this with the destruction in New York City, but *Man of Steel* basically didn't try to give emotional weight to the thousands that died.

  Mostly the movie just sucked - it was a bunch of flashy, enjoyable action scenes that strung together nonsense.

    This is why I an avid superman fan haven't seen it; (superman is a good first step for transhumanity to aspire too, aside from his physical impossibility)  

    That said, this is an interesting idea that would be a very compelling morality tale if done right.  Please do write it and give us a rational, but militant, General Zod's struggle to restore krypton.  

    If you do, as a "If bilbo is a Jedi, then Sauran  must have a death star" I'd suggest Supes being orders of magnitude more powerful, including his speed of thinking, due to having spent all of his life in a yellow sun.

      Or start up the sequel to Metropoliton man with General Zod arriving and announcing his intentions, and asking where Superman is.

        That story should probably end with "where is superman?" resonating out of every sufficiently conductive wire or something else of that nature.

        Well, Superman isn't just transhuman-like, he's a superhuman who's not a dick. You aspire to him for his morality, not just his power.

        The Time Lords are not like that.
        ```

          Also the time lords leave lots to be desired in their optimization of time travel to "any use"

        I'm guessing you are basing this on the new Doctors.  As far as the good wizard coming from the sky, or the blood soaked trickster god who will change/optimize your entire societies value system, I agree.

        As for canonical Galifrey. . . um, no the time lords basically have a elder civilization prohibition against acting, and make stupid exceptions, for space opera plot reasons, but then again I side with new Chaos over the prime directive in the Open Door.
        ```

          Actually, I was basing it on how the older Time Lords *don't* play Sanctimonious Intergalactic Colonialist.

          Remember, when you talk about those later Doctors, you're speaking of someone who would probably wipe out the Culture claiming that Humanity Is Not Ready.  He's got some kind of hate-on for anything beyond the 21st century baseline humanity he likes.

  ```
  In the film, I thought it was implied he could have picked another planet to terraform, but picked earth pretty much just to be a dick and punish superman's father vicariously through superman and the people of earth.

  The biggest problem with that movie, at least from a rational fiction point of view, is that there is really no reason for the fundamental conflict. Had Zod been acting sensibly, he could simply have popped down to Earth to meet Clark, explained the situation, asked him to help restore his species, and then terraformed Venus or something. He could have literally achieved every one of his goals had he simply decided against exterminating the human race for no good reason.

  I'd almost go as far as saying that Zod fails at being a level 1 intelligent character -- if not for the fact that people with power frequently *do* act like this, committing atrocities simply because it is convenient and satisfies their more ugly human urges. I remember reading somewhere that the true human relation to power, subconsciously recognized by everyone, is the ability to inflict injustice without consequence. Add to that the research demonstrating that power and wealth bias humans to higher levels of callousness and ethical laxity. 

  For this reason, I generally think Zod mostly qualifies as a level 1 intelligent character. The bit that I find a little doubtful is his pointless decision to kill off a technologically inferior species that had nothing to do with him or the losses he suffered. I suppose he could plausibly be considered to be mad with grief and/or power, but you'd think that this elder race would at least have learned how to condition their military commanders, no?

  On a lighter note, how the hell is Jor-El, a Kryptonian bred and conditioned for scientific research, able to beat the shit out of multiple trained soldiers (okay fine, he had the element of surprise, but dat kung fu), and then take on Zod in single combat and *win*? 

  I think I'd have been happier watching the movie *Jor-El: Science Badass* instead.

    Jor-El's clearly the Kryptonian Number Man. He calculates the physics necessary to beat them.
