## A theory on the fundamental constraints/observations of Pokemon: The Origin of Species by DaystarEld

### Post:

**DISCLAIMER: Please note that this is not a very well formed/articulated thought you're about to read. I just needed to pen it down before it escaped my mind (Although I think that some of it might have).**

**I'd love it if you could criticize the flaws of the argument. I'd appreciate it more if you found a way to build on it.**

&#x200B;

**Reference:**

Bulbapedia: "Mew is said to have the DNA of every single Pokémon contained within its body, and as such is able to learn any attack."

Pokedex of Pokemon Crystal on Mew: "Because it can learn any move, some people began research to see if it is the ancestor of all Pokémon."

&#x200B;

**Argument:**

Ancestry doesn't work like that. If we were to trace back our genes to the very first deviation in the genus Homo, and then go further back in a similar fashion to the first microscopic form of "life", it wouldn't contain the entire genomic database of all the species that were to evolve from it.

I can figure out these possibilities:

* The theory of Mew being the ancestor of every pokemon because of having the entire genetic database of everything is similar to a belief that our ancestors wrongly formulated: God containing all of the information and everything being made in his image.

A different way to look at what - a species of which has the entire genetic database stored - would be like is an AI. One that has compiled abiogenesis. If such an AI could essentially go into any of these genetic states and, let's say, become any species by using this makeup as a stable state, this would technically need the engineers finding a way to encode all of the genetic information biologically(I'm assuming Mewtwo instead of a silicon approach).

Therefore, there was no Mew. It had to be a Myth that the older generation formulated. And Giovanni set out to work it out.

&#x200B;

* If there was indeed some form of gene which had in it all the genetic information of all the pokemon encoded, then that meant that life that arose from it was a different kind of genesis: One where all available information was already present, and the traits the inheritors of those genes displayed was a permanency enforced by some form of environmental effect, along with some sort of mutation randomness.

Which means that Pokemon's could theoretically be altered to have other traits just by triggering untriggered part of their genes. Which IS being done. By Technical Machines.

If Mew did contain all of the genetic information, it wouldn't be "Evolution" that took place in Pokemon, but rather, "Computation".

&#x200B;

Also note that since Pokemon and Humans essentially share some "Power" traits, this could point to the "computation" being some form of "unrealized" technology, and could/could not be extended to a common species depending on their compatibility.

Which makes a good case for Atlantean Origins. Or any highly advanced sentient lifeform which mostly perished due to the misuse of the said technology.

**NOTE: I'm trying to emulate what <potentially big> insight the author might have had studying the inconsistencies of the Pokemon Universe as compared to the real world.**

**EDIT: The two points might/not be related. I was just floating around ideas.**

  The story lampshades the term evolution at one point. - Red points out that it's more of a metamorphosis really, but yadda yadda yadda (something social sciency) 

  Anyway, entry A might not be related to entry B. Its genome contains a lot of random information, that happens to include all the other genes found in Pokemon. All that means is most Pokemon have simple genomea and mew has a complex one, or maybe it travels a lot and stores the DNA of everything it eats within its body.

  It being the ancestor of all Pokemon because of the ability to learn all the moves doesn't have to be related to that at all.

    I remember that, and actually it kind of bugged me because it felt like imposing scientific meanings from our own world onto the pokemon world. Like, sure, the creators of pokemon in our world were probably misusing the word "evolution", and I get that the author was lampshading that. But in-universe, evolution *means* pokemon evolution. Even if Red is taking a prescriptivist-linguistic approach, where did that prescription even come from? People have observed pokemon evolution for thousands of years. The meaning of evolution as in pokemon evolution would have been the first.

    I think *evolution* actually works fine to describe Pokémon metamorphosis/transmutation, both in its modern and in its historic sense. I guess there’s some notion of it being a bit more gradual than the rapid (revolutionary) process by which Pokémon evolve canonically, though I’ve also read fanfics which show the process happening in a manner more like conventional growth and development, with stages just being periods of stasis.

    I do recall the lampshading in this fic, though, but don’t remember its exact context (on mobile so it’s obnoxious to look for it). What’s the status of “Darwinian” thought here? Is it believed applicable to humans, Pokémon, and other organisms? Is common descent among them all accepted? Is the breadth of fossil diversity limited to the dozen-ish Pokémon we see in the games, or if there are e.g. mundane birds around does that mean e.g. there are dinosaur fossils somewhere? Has the basis of heredity been worked out yet? Has the pokéquivalent of the modern synthesis occurred? etc. I think I remember DNA, Dawkins, and maybe some other 20th century stuff mentioned — does that mean all prior “discoveries” have also been made?

  I have no idea what you're talking about. I'm not sure if I can even catalog all of my points of confusion, but I'll try. Beware: spaghetti post.

  >A different way to look at what - a species of which has the entire genetic database stored - would be like is an AI. 

  How? A dictionary has the entire lexical database stored. Is a dictionary an AI? Is a mouse with a dictionary an AI?

  >One that has compiled abiogenesis.

  I know both of those words, but I don't know what you mean when you put them together like that. The least incoherent reading I can think of is that some external force simulated what the universe will look like, with all the organisms in it, then it went back and encoded that into Mew's genome. And I think that you are postulating that the researchers are postulating such a force, and calling it God or whatever?

  >If [Mew uses its DNA to Transform], this would technically need the engineers finding a way to encode all of the genetic information biologically(I'm assuming Mewtwo instead of a silicon approach).

  Wait, what? Why are there engineers now? If Mew (as the researchers imagine it) can Transform into anything described by subsets of its genome, then... no, it clearly doesn't need a team of engineers to do so. It already encodes the genetic information biologically. Because it is a biological thing with genes. At what point in your thought process is the genetic information encoded any other way? Why are you even mentioning Mewtwo here? Are you trying to say that the Mewtwo project invented Mew by blending together every other Pokemon, and then they created Mewtwo in order to... encode the information that they encoded in order to make Mew? I can't follow your reasoning at all.

  >Therefore, there was no Mew. It had to be a Myth that the older generation formulated.

  How does that follow? How did you conclude that it is impossible that there just really is a god that speciates by subtraction?

  >And Giovanni set out to work it out.

  If there never was a Mew, then what is there to "work out"? It's a thing that never existed, described by people who don't understand genetics. What concrete steps does "work it out" entail, starting from that?

  >If Mew did contain all of the genetic information, it wouldn't be "Evolution" that took place in Pokemon, but rather, "Computation".

  I have no idea what "computation" is supposed to mean here. Are you going back to the universe-simulating force from the other possibility, that I thought was separate? What makes you say that evolution is not the thing that is being computed? What distinction are you trying to make here?

  >this could point to the "computation" being some form of "unrealized" technology, and could/could not be extended to a common species depending on their compatibility.

  "Computation"? "Unrealized"? "Technology"? "Extended"? "Compatibility"? I can't even parse this sentence.

  >Which makes a good case for Atlantean Origins.

  I couldn't follow a single line of thought or piece of evidence that lead you to this conclusion.

  Also, I hate it. Sometimes Flying particles are just things that exist in the universe. Bringing in some ancient magic superscience to explain why the story's world isn't identical to our world is the worst kind of unsatisfying non-explanation, on par with "Red is a kid in the real world imagining the whole thing."

  What comes to mind for me:  Colonisation, or more probably semi-Terraforming.

  &#x200B;

  Some species sends out Mews to potentially-habitable planets.  Cramming all the DNA into one organism cuts costs and logistic difficulties of preparing an entire self-sustaining colony ship (either multigenerational, or through costly stasis/hibernation pods, some Pokemon maybe not able to be put into stasis/hibernation):  you just get the Mew as a form that can dormantly be hurled through space until it survives landing on a planet, optionally being able to guide itself into the orbit of a planet (through gas expulsion, or solar-sail-like wings?).

  &#x200B;

  The Mew lands on a planet, tries to colonise the planet, and the 'unpacked' Pokemon with no natural predators except for each other either are wiped out by native wildlife or quickly dominate native wildlife instead.  Maybe some centuries/millennia later, either the Mew-sending species (if not encoded within the Mew too) arrives and finds all its familiar tasty and home-materials animals already everywhere, or (if encoded within the Mew too) makes contact with its own kind, which presumably have inherited ancestral memories of some sort.  Or they just show up and say.  "You, this particular sort of psychic pokemon.  You've become the dominant species, right?  You're a colony of us, so please start sending us your planet's resources."

  &#x200B;

  Now, the main question:  are humans native wildlife that thrived through intelligence, despite the extinction of pretty much all other non-Pokemon native wildlife?  If so, did they through being even more intellectually capable than the Mew-encoded intelligent dominant species, or by the intelligent dominant species who sent the Mew not encoding themselves within it, planning to arrive later after the planet was comfortable for them?  If humans aren't native wildlife, and are encoded within Mew too, then does that mean that a much-older human government who sent Mew are going to make contact at some point?

  &#x200B;

  Of course, it could also be a dying planet sending out Mews, but then I imagine there would be a greater focus on preserved cultural information.

  &#x200B;

  ...Hmm, by the original Mew concept, I'm incidentally reminded of an absurd moment in the Utawarerumono anime.  "Now, watchers, you've wondered all along about the identity of this magical being with godlike power.  His true identity is...  the missing link between dinosaurs and humans!"  "What."
