## The Two Year Emperor Delayed -- Fanfiction.net is borked

### Post:

I just tried to upload today's chapter and I'm getting a 503 "No server is available to handle this request" error.  I'll try again periodically through the day, but no promises when it will be available.

  I just want you to know that I read your story and found it fantastic. Absolutely fantastic!

    Thank you so much!  I really appreciate it.

    What's your opinion on Book 2 vs Book 1?  They are extremely different and Book 2 is a bit of an experiment for me, so I'm curious what the audience feels about it.

      I'm worried about Suze.  I wasn't so worried about Jake, because as dire as things seemed, I thought he could make it through.  Suze, while she is (or at least was) a wonderful person, I'm not sure she's got what it takes to be Death.

      Given the previous mentorship role, I'm a little surprised Suze hasn't asked Jake for help.  But I guess part of it is that this is her show, not his now.

      I found book one intriguing with the munchkinry problem solving. Honestly book two has failed to connect with me so far, and if not for book one I would not have continued reading. To me book one read like an action adventure and book two is more of a character drama, and that just isn't as much my cup of tea. Your writing is excellent in both though.

        Adventure story / character drama: yeah, that's fair. 

        If you liked the first book, "[One Hot Night](http://greendogpress.blogspot.com/2014/05/greendog-press-is-open-for-business-our.html)" is likely to be up your alley. </shameless_plug>

  Just so you know, apparently it's due to a Korean spam attack.

  - u/eaglejarl:
    ```
    Good to know, thanks.

- u/None:
  ```
  Thank you for the heads up. ff.net doesn't always have the best internal workings.
