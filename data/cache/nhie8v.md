## Rationalist Giver Story

### Post:

I'm looking for a specific rationalist version of The Giver where Jonas' conclusion is that they should use the gathered memories to build hospitals, and specifically in the case of 'should we have more babies,' make an informed decision based on food stores. The giver himself says they just want a simple yes or no answer, and when Jonas persists, says something about leaving with the implication that Jonas would either be killed or made to leave the village.

For some reason, I thought it was an omake of HPMOR, but I looked through the omake chapters and couldn't find it.

    I knew it had to do with HMPOR! Thanks so much!
