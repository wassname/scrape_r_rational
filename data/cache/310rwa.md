  Yay, update!

  Is this
  > The boulders of its body are twice the height of a tall man

  consistent with this?
  > The onix's head is about as big as he is

  Is its head boulder half the size of it's body boulders?  A [google image search](https://www.google.com/search?q=onyx&safe=off&rlz=1CAACAG_enUS613US613&es_sm=93&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=7vobVe6JJcG1ggSrsISgDw&ved=0CAcQ_AUoAQ&biw=1366&bih=677#safe=off&tbm=isch&q=onix+pokemon) seems to indicate no, but maybe it's different in this fic.  

  Also:
  > A year ago, Brock fought a fully grown tyranitar that had come down from Mount Silver. four stories tall, each of its feet the size of a car, able to topple a building with a sweep of its tail.

    Woops, yeah, that "twice" shouldn't be there :) Thanks!

  Nice chapter. Was interesting to see the viewpoint of a Gym Leader in this world, as well as the creation myths each town may have as legends, not to mention what might be the commonly accepted one in the region overall. I really liked how you portrayed Brock's Onix - a great sense of age and power could be felt as you described it.

    Thanks, I've always wanted to mess with the idea that each region only has the legends about pokemon we as gamers already know about, or that all legends would only be the one-of-a-kind type of species rather than special "normal" ones.   Some games played with the idea a bit, especially the Red Gyarados at Lake Rage, and I always thought it made the world feel more immersive :)  Glad you liked it!

  Now I'm trying to figure out how to expand on the myth system, "... but /our/ ancestor was the weak Optimizing Process known as Evolution Through Natural Selection"...

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    Haha. "The god that made our ancestors was a bit lazier than the others, and figured, hey, they're doing the work of setting optimzing pressures and conditions..."

  I am once more impressed about your ideas on how trainers convey orders to the types of pokemon of the world. The metal tipped gloves for Rock types, it just fits, like a glove(Snerk). But really, I enjoy seeing the ways you have come up with how that is handled.

  "Brock body" should be "Brock's body" I think.
