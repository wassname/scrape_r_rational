## A question about the relative popularity of rational fiction[Q][D]

### Post:

From what I've observed, rationalfic seems to be a somewhat popular genre relative to other genres of fiction based on the only metrics I have available to judge(namely, follower/favorite counts or similar).  To what extent do your observations correlate with mine?

  I think selection bias adequately explains it.

    Really?  Even when using straight-up rankings by most followed from ffn?

      Show us your metrics. Having actual numbers to reference helps; otherwise, you're basically just asserting "stuff my subculture likes seems popular".

        For actual numbers for the stuff I've posted to ff.net:

        There are 535 stories under ["Terminator"](https://www.fanfiction.net/movie/Terminator/); [Branches on the Tree](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9658524/1/Branches-on-the-Tree-of-Time) of Time is 6th in Reviews, 2nd in Favorites, and 2nd in Follows.

        There are 545 stories under ["Superman"](https://www.fanfiction.net/comic/Superman/); [The Metropolitan Man](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10360716/1/The-Metropolitan-Man) is 2nd in Reviews, 1st in Favorites, and 1st in Follows.

        There are 4.2K stories under ["Mythology"](https://www.fanfiction.net/misc/Mythology/); [The Last Christmas](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9915682/1/The-Last-Christmas) is somewhere I couldn't find in Reviews, 8th in Favorites, and 18th in Follows.

        There are 9.4K stories under ["Frozen"](https://www.fanfiction.net/movie/Terminator/); [A Bluer Shade of White](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10327510/1/A-Bluer-Shade-of-White) is 24th page for Reviews (~600), 8th page for Favorites (~200), and 26th page for Follows (~650).

        (But those are just my numbers and it's probable that you can't extrapolate from those to rational fiction generally.)

        Generally speaking, the biggest thing that determines how many reviews a fic gets seems to be how many chapters it has, mostly because you can leave a review for each chapter. Works get followed if they need following, so things which are complete don't tend to get followed. Other than that, I'm sure there's a marketing and/or word of mouth aspect to it that explains a lot of the numbers, popularity and quality aside.

        HPMoR is 2nd or first most followed or most reviewed.  2YE, when it was up, was(I think), most followed or at least in the top 5.  /u/alexanderwales's work is in the top 5 or ten in a few genres(For example, Branches on the tree of time is 2nd most favorited and followed).  My own fanfic, Light in Despair's Darkness, is 5th most followed.

  ```
  One part of it on FFN is that most people who read rational fiction don't read the majority of the other types of stuff on FFN; there's a rational fiction enclave.

  How are you determining what is rational fiction on FFN?
