  Random theory:  We are currently in the "Aaron" portion of the story, based on the kabbalistic "rn" messenger archetype.  Later, we will reach the "Smith" portion (theory below), then the "Teller" portion, for calling down dangerous celestial energies.

  Halfway-independent of the above, I think "Smith" has the kabbalistic meaning of "one who knows the value of things" which we get from Adam Smith.

    The "invisible hand" that Smith uses as a symbol of the force of individuals following incentives evokes a popular vision of God. How does this relate to Moloch?

  I wish I knew more people to whom I could send that second paragraph, on 7-11, and get smiles from.

    Right? I would throw down good money for that.

White is actually surprisingly good, generally it is difficult to make good looking novelty white t-shirts.

  Should continue to put the title of the story in the submission, no?

  > A FRIEND

  Hmm... Wonder if this friend is anyone/anything we already know?
  ```

    Theorization in the comment thread has Sarah herself as the friend.

    I am not entirely sure I buy it. 

    Guesses as to the identity of Sarah:

    - Ana or Aaron, or some future ally of theirs, having timetravelled back in time and used invisibility to arrange these shenanigans, and therefore has the predictive powers ascribed here by being from a future where it was true. 
    - Sarah the internet which was collectively ensouled and is busy becoming a superintelligence, and is using Ana and Aaron as a distraction.
    - Sarah the computer individually 
    - Alvarez or the Comet King or Sohu or someone else in the giant "mysterious powers and not-fully-explained-backstory" list.
    ```

      I don't think it can be Sarah. Even assuming that the vital name made Sarah independent, which I'm skeptical of (since Sarah didn't get the animal soul), there hasn't been enough time to get very many names. Most names wouldn't be useful in breaking into an unsong detention facility. Three names which are perfect for it coming out of a small set of random names is too much. This would have to be someone who ALREADY has a lot of names, not merely someone with the ability to find names. Sarah the internet would qualify potentially, but has other issues
      ```

      - u/alexanderwales:
        ```
        As a counterpoint, if Sarah was independent I don't think that too little time has passed in order for it to purchase computing power and vastly increase its ability to churn through names. So it might be that the set of new names is very, very large.

        But we don't know to what extent the ensouling worked, or how it worked.
        ```

        - u/SoundLogic2236:
          ```
          Sarah wouldn't know the vital name, even if it can still be used. We don't know exactly what the vital name targets, and neither would Sarah even if independent-humans had the vital name applied to them and didn't know how to apply it to other things or what the exact requirements of human involvement were. So even if Sarah managed to get a lot of computing power, Sarah might not know how to move itself onto the bigger cluster.
          ```

    - u/Izeinwinter:
      ```
      In favor of "Sarah" the internet, someone, somewhere will have tried the animal and moral names on computer hardware hooked up to the net. Just to see if that made for better robots or voice recognition systems. So, Aaron might merely have completed a process begun by others.
      ```

  - u/DataPacRat:
    ```
    Now, who do we already know who has a soul, has had the opportunity to research new Names, and access to Sarah's desktop? :)
    ```

  - u/SometimesATroll:
    ```
    Of course we know her.  Sarah has been a part of the story for several chapters, now.

    The real question is whether Sarah is actually a friend or not.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      If you ask a computer if they're a friend, they're, like, obligated to tell you.
      It's in the Constitution.

        Noted friendly AI Friend Computer.
        ```

- u/LiteralHeadCannon:
  ```
  Kind of late on this guess, but what if the Vital Name only works once per user, and Aaron and Ana count as the same user?
  ```

  - u/ulyssessword:
    ```
    My theory is that a soul can only be split three ways.  Aaron 's is him, Ana, and Sarah.  Ana's is her, Aaron and (whatshername, from the first marriage test).

    I may be mixing my mythology, but I got it from Father, Son, and Holy Spirit 

    Edit: my other theory is that the Name ensouled "computer-kind" in one go, and that the original use ensouled "humanity" in the same way.
