## Too much rationality, too much intelligence a bad thing in fiction?

### Post:

I was reading the rational Animorphs and I got to thinking -- is too much rationality a bad thing in fiction? I mean, fiction is about entertainment, and entertainment is about bringing pleasure to the reader by allowing her to imagine fulfilling various human drives in extremely satisfying ways. And human drives are *not* rational, and past a certain point the more intelligent the characters are the less space there is for those unintelligent human drives, the less sense it makes to have scenes that fulfill those drives in the story. 

Consider superhero fiction. One of the main human drives it satisfies is the love of power, of having the power to do amazing things, being able to shape reality to your will if you just try hard enough. What would you do, the story asks, if you had that kind of power?

The problem is that as you increase a character's intelligence more and more, you circumscribe her actions more and more. This is what Niven was talking about in Protector -- more intelligence means less free will, for a certain definition of free will where that means being able to satisfy frankly stupid human drives over one's stated goals. 

In superhero fiction, for instance, the more intelligence there is, the less room there is for exciting and thrilling struggle, for throwing around flashy powers while you keep the reader on the edge of her seat, for literary conflict. A smart villain won't allow a beaten hero to live to return triumphant another day, a smart hero won't allow the villain to return to threaten all that is right and just another day.

The more intelligence the characters in a story have, the faster the outcome becomes a foregone conclusion, like how in a RTS game between perfect players the outcome comes down to how fast each side got their resource extraction up in the beginning and how much resources in the form of units they were able to preserve in the first few minutes during the rushes. A superhero fight between really intelligent opponents won't be flashy with monologues and chances for the hero and villain to recover from a bad move and  all spectacular with them slinging bridges and such at each other. It will be over in an unsatisfying (to the reader's stupid human drives) instant, a momentary flash of movement and then one or the other dead, with it being faster the more destructive powers the combatants have, just as two countries having nukes removes the "glory and horror" from war and makes it just a matter of a few minutes of really big explosions.

Stories with characters that are too intelligent feel dead and cold and frightening, with no room for human expression and idiocy in them, with the author's hand obvious as she tugs and pulls at the events in the story to try to prolong it past what it should be.

How to fix this? Perhaps one can focus on the world as it looks to a superintelligence. It is only to average intelligence that the story looks short and cold. Perhaps you can take the reader inside the mind of something more than human, show them what it means to have greater intelligence, and then that brief flash of unsatisfying action can be slowed down to the comprehension of a mere human.

Does increased intelligence move much of the conflict from the physical to the mental, requiring the author to show that mental conflict in a really compelling manner to make the story interesting again?

  While intelligence might limit some characters, I think it opens up so much more space realistically (I personally hate it when the "hero" of the story just happens to find "ultimate loot 1, 2 and 3" and "specific counter to not yet seen opponent 5" just by chance; but if the character is intelligent enough to send someone else to do a risky fetch quest and thus they don't get ambushed and then blackmails the "ambusher", that I can enjoy), though the morals may need to be a bit towards Blue and Orange Morality.

  But I do think it is harder to write stories that are rational, I had DMed A DND5E game where I tried to have a few rational NPCs, it made it a lot harder...

  I take the opposite perspective from yours on a number of issues here, which makes me think this might be more about preferences than objective judgement. 

  For me, the more unintelligent characters there are, the faster the outcomes become predictable, not the other way around. Unintelligent characters mean the story flows into the same tropes and wellworn paths that we've seen in the majority of fiction, because the majority of fiction doesn't involve intelligent characters. Maybe what you're saying is that stories with intelligent characters are too similar in outcomes to each other, but even then I'd argue that point.

  Similarly, now that I'm older, throwing around flashy powers is boring when done by unintelligent characters. The less sense their actions make, the less engaged I am, because the more the veneer of suspense covering the fact that the fights are pre-scripted falls apart. I need smart application of powers to be entertained by even simple things like energy beams.

  And you seem to be assuming that intelligent characters have equally ridiculous power levels, where the fight has to be over in an "instant." I don't see how that follows: the tools someone has at their disposal and the intelligence to use those powers has to be balanced by the writer to make the story entertaining: if they can't do that, it's their failure as a writer, not the result of having intelligent characters.

  As for making realistic mistakes and satisfying human experiences of not being hyper intelligent all the time, that's also down to writer skill. There's a difference between handing a character an Idiot Ball to make them do stupid things just to propel your plot along and generate conflict, and giving them actual reasons to make sub-optimal choices, such as reducing their information, trickery on the part of their opponents, or justifiably compromising situations, like having your thoughts clouded by anger or pain.

  Overall I think a lot of these come down to the skill of the writer.  Just making characters smarter doesn't make fiction entertaining. That's a separate aspect of the process.

  It's mostly a matter of execution.

  You can totally have two superheroes monologuing at each other in rational fiction, but they do it because they're both trying to win the fight *and* trying to improve their public image at the same time. Or they're *actually trying to convince each other* and spare themselves the fight.

  And you can have neato fights, but those are largely dependent on how you do your worldbuilding. If you give someone the power to explode heads from a distance, then no, you're not going to get a grand epic battle out of it. But if it's not possible for two opponents to kill each other in an instant, and if terrain matters, and if there are other considerations to the fight beyond just life and death, and if etc. then yes, you can get good battles where two intelligent opponents are acting rationally.

  But I do think that this is *harder* than just having stupid fist fights that are dictated by plot instead of logic.

  Suppose the average level of intelligence in the world was what we'd consider to be IQ 140.  The writers, naturally, would tend to be a bit smarter than that.  Is it impossible for them to write organically good literature?  Do they need to write stories about people as dumb as the characters in our world in order to be able to write stories?  Or does the intelligence everywhere in the fiction just organically go up with nobody thinking much of it?

  You can't actually write characters smarter than yourself in a certain sense.  And in fact there's a sense in which everyone in HPMOR had to be dumber than I was or they would have just walked all over my authorial world and seen right through my plots.  Further, the variety in the characters is me giving them different pieces and facets of myself, with nobody getting the whole thing, because then there wouldn't be anything left for the other characters.  So in that sense I did have to write characters dumber than I am.  But once I'm up against that limit, why would I go any lower?  If I was in a world where I was average, I'd be able to write average stories for that world; so why shouldn't I just write those stories here?

  I'm going to wade in here because I think everybody is missing the point I would want to make.

  Rational fiction featuring intelligent characters is only ever boring if there is only one, or perhaps two, clearly stated intelligent characters, using their brains to manipulate what are essentially underlings as they fight each other.

  In good rational fiction, this is not the case. In good rational fiction, everybody is smart, and that means that there are so many players, and so many factions, that it becomes increasingly difficult to predict it all. That's part of why HPMOR was so interesting. We read is mostly from the perspective of intelligent, rational children, who simply did not know enough about their environment to fully understand all the gambits happening around them. They could be surprised. They could be ambushed, because with every move they made they were attracting the attention of new players with new motives they didn't know about.

  To use your example from RTS games and perfect play;
  In good rational fiction, the hero goes in to fight the villain knowing he is good at RTS games and thinking he can beat them on that front. Only then halfway through the game it becomes apparent that the villain knew of their skill, and somehow skewed the game in their favour. Or the game is a distraction; somewhere else the villain's main plot is happening. In good rational fiction, players don't walk into perfect games where it is all about pure skill, not when the stakes are real. This is not the point of plotting (one of the hallmarks of rational fiction). In good rat fics, everybody and anybody is essentially cheating, and winning requires cheating better. 

  And in good rational fiction, if the main character did not think of this and take it into account (which they most likely haven't, unless it's the kind of boring story featuring super intelligent gods curb stomping the enemy), then they will only find out when the readers does and boom; suddenly you can have flashy action scenes, improvised battle plans, and all the other hall marks of fiction as they try to escape the 'ambush'.

  You're making things absurd by insisting that they be taken to absurd extremes or not done at all.

  You keep asserting that intelligence, in sufficient quantities, is essentially omniscience and omnipotence. Sufficient for what? Sufficient for omniscience and omnipotence. And?

  You can say the same thing about lots of stuff. Fiction should be about slow characters instead of fast ones, because at his greatest the Flash is essentially invincible and so leads to boring stories. Fiction should be about weaklings, because well, at the extreme strong characters are literally omnipotent. Fiction should be an endless sprawling mess of exposition and minute detail and meaningless irrelevant side plots, because at the extreme if you just say what needs to be there to understand the story, you just explain the final novelty in the fewest words possible. 

  Fuck yeah it's boring if you do it like that.

  Why stop at fiction? Medical care is a bad thing because at the far end, we'll bankrupt the entire world trying to keep a single human vegetable alive one more moment. Eating is a bad thing because eventually you'll explode like a monty python sketch.

  Oh, wait. You said "Too much" intelligence is a bad thing.

  That's a tautology. Too much anything is a bad thing by definition. It's right there in the "too much" part.

  That doesn't mean that writing stories where the characters are as intelligent as real-world smart people is in any way worse than writing stories full of characters who are as stupid as real-world stupid people who are actively trying to re-enact their favorite stories about stupid people. Don't give me some shit about how smart people always act optimally and so their stories are repetitive and predictable. If you're having that problem, your real problem is that you have shitty characters and not enough conflict in your story.

  Every character should have multiple valid and sane desires of debatable relative importance. They make decisions that are hard to predict because they actually value the results in slightly different ways that are hard to predict, and that interact in ways that are hard to predict. The rest of them cope *well* but not *perfectly,* because they're intelligent *people,* and not the living avatars of the SmartForce.

  I've had similar thoughts myself, before. 

  I've thought about "what would I do if I could x" and for powerful enough x, invariably the answer is "*sigh*, I suppose I need to maximize its use to save as many lives / reduce as much suffering as possible, otherwise I would feel guilty."

  This extends even to personal fantasizing, so to satisfy myself, I have to add a disclaimer like "this happens in a virtual world without other sentient beings" or "a magical being comes and eliminates all suffering, what do you do now" or whatever.

  Anyways, besides that tangent, I feel the following way:

  Your solution of "slowing down" time and ideas seems fine, except that I think it might be difficult to pull off realistically. You might have to do it in terms of metaphors of some sort and probably a great deal of suspension of disbelief. Still, if done properly, I think it could be very entertaining. 

  In this line, rational fiction is interesting in its own right because it is so rare, but in a different way from normal fiction. If you can show some of the planning that the characters do during the planning phase, and then show how those plans are circumvented and then the characters manage to use some secret fallbacks (that were nevertheless hinted at) or whatever to recover when it looks like they were sure to be eliminated, but still at some cost to the protagonist. I feel like (Significant Digits)[http://www.anarchyishyperbole.com/p/significant-digits.html] (hpmor fanfic) does this well, but I won't reveal how, for spoiler purposes.

  Like running an epic level Dungeons and Dragons campaign, it's basically more about matching power than about absolute power. You could show the protagonist absolutely dominating some people and then have them face their match. 

  Also, bear in mind, rational fic doesn't necessarily mean "Overpowered" fic. It more means characters not doing obviously stupid things. You can have rational characters with low absolute power facing less rational characters with very high power, and still have them struggle and provide an interesting fight for the viewer.

  Another option is to have a semi-rational but in some way "insane" villain (or at least one whose goals are sufficiently different from normal human goals), like Tarquin from Order of the Stick (warning: Order of the Stick spoilers ahead). He is shown to be very "genre savvy" in the sense that he [writes a list to prevent his (non-rational) soldiers fall for the classic movie tricks](http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0766.html), nevertheless, his eventual goal is to [die in a dramatic manner](http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0763.html) due to his love of story. A sufficiently powerful and rational character that values narrative could force the protagonist to act narratively (or at least pretend to act narratively, whilst actually executing a secret plan) in order to defeat them. However, this falls more towards the comedy genre.

  On a similar note, you could have an otherwise rational character with some major personality flaw which can be used to defeat them. You could also have a rational but evil character who just doesn't care about others, and after setting up what they feel to be sufficient precautions, then proceed to explore their power. 

  Let me know what you think!

  You started this thought with r!Animorphs.  I'm curious if the rest of the thought applies directly to r!Animorphs (i.e. whether you think it's bad/boring/less entertaining/more predictable fiction as a result), or whether your thoughts meandered further and it isn't a direct commentary.  If you don't mind sharing, that is.

If you don't mind sharing, that is.

    Not really a direct commentary. Animorphs was starting to give me that cold fearful feeling that there was no room for human stupidity/humanity in it (I've only made it to chapter 14). The thing that started my thought going in that direction was the fact that without the intervention of a previously unknown robot thing, by this point the heroes would all be dead. Or without the intervention of the God/fate/probability manipulating entities you keep hinting at. It felt like the hand of the author preventing a foregone conclusion from coming to pass (those with the most resources *will* beat those with less resources if they both have equal intelligence, baring the whims of pure chance, and the author's hand forcing the plot to go as it should rather than as makes sense is generally disguised as the whim of chance. Or, you know, probability manipulating entities).

    Also, I haven't ever read the non-rational Animorphs, and I was reconstructing in my mind what those books must have been about, which I was imagining was probably the joy of being able to become any animal and have all their skills and abilities with a human mind, and I was thinking about how much you had to squeeze and scrape to fit even a bit of that into a rational setting where the heroes and villains had enhanced intelligence without it endangering the heroes' goals, with people being stupid by having fun being their house cat or whatever and accidentally getting everyone killed.

    Is it better to make the villains with greater resources less intelligent rather than needing probability manipulating entities and suddenly appearing robots to justify the heroes not just losing instantly? I'm not sure. And I get that the robots were probably a required artifact of the non-rational Animorphs, so I'm not really complaining that much about them.

      Personally I think I would be enjoying it less if the villains weren't as intelligent and the Chee weren't included. I think it's all being handled very well, so it's balancing the various extremely powerful forces and the competing intelligences of the heroes and bad guys wonderfully, but if it were handled any worse it would likely fail on a number of levels, yes. Hence the point that writing intelligent characters in a story well requires intelligence and hard work.

      Ha, that's... very little of what canonical Animorphs were about. I can totally see how you might think that though, and it would have made for a much less depressing book series :)

      Gotcha.  FWIW, the canon Animorphs books were *unsettlingly* heavy and dark, dealing with issues like PTSD and suicide and the moral justification of murder and war crimes and so forth.  That was interspersed with a lot of the joy of becoming an animal, but it was more serious, on average, than (say) Avatar: The Last Airbender.

  I'm kind of confused by what you mean. Are you specifically talking about human characters? IMHO, if someone's intelligence is able to surpass instinctual human conditioning, they're either an enlightened being or an alien entity. Writing about characters with the level of intelligence you're implying isn't very realistic and would handicap the work, unless the whole point of the story is seeing their unique perspective. I honestly think it's all up to the writer and how they handle it. 

  You talk about there not being excitement in a fight between two intelligent opponents, but I completely disagree. I hesitate to use this as an example, but a show like Death Note wasn't exciting because of its flashy battles. It literally had none. It built up hype because of the escalating tension. It showed its character's line of thinking and created suspense with every decision they took. If a battle between incredibly smart individuals isn't exciting, it's not because intelligence diminishes fights, it's because of shitty storytelling. A good writer can make five seconds the most exciting/satisfying part of a story, just by its execution. A great one would make the build up to it just as exciting as the conclusion.

  DayStarEld makes great points on intelligence.  To add to that, rationality is merely acting optimally in order to satisfy your value-informed goals.  Values are, I think, most often formed during one's upbringing.  For example, a character raised on a cricket and ruminant farm that couldn't keep up its profits and was replaced with a factory farm, might value giving purpose to and having respect for all life.  Their goals would relate to encouraging the latter and making the former a reality.  No matter how intelligent you are, accomplishing those goals would prove a tremendous challenge.

  Rationality means the alignment of your values, goals, and actions.  It's up to the writer to decide how unique and interesting to make each of the three.

  Imagine that we live in a world that revolved around tic-tac-toe. We play the game with real suspense and curiosity about who is going to win. We write stories about these games! One day, some extraordinally intelligent writer comes along and ruins it all by writing a character that always drew or won, and worse explained it in a way that everybody else could understand, so now *everybody* always drew in their games. That would be too much intelligence in character (from the perspectives of the people in that world).

  Our world doesn't revolve around such simple games as tic-tac-toe, or even a much more complicated unsolved game like go. It's a much much vaster game. There is no one goal of the game, each player has their own variation which (on the object level at least) changes over time. Worse yet, we are embedded in this game, and so as players become more intelligent it becomes more interesting for those players. It's going to be a *very* long time before humans can write intelligent enough characters to make this game as boring as tic-tac-toe.
