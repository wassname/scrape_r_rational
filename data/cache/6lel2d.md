## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  Every now and then I hear an idea so absurd that I just want to see it brought to life. A film company run by mobsters who kidnap actors and rob banks to make movies and tv shows, dragons hosting a show about food who travel around the world eating exotic *people*, or robots who attack live theater performances because they hate live theater. These are the kind of wacky ideas I love to see in sci-fi/fantasy comedies, but what puts my favorites in this subgenre a step above the others is when the story makes a surprising amount of sense.

  The Bill & Ted movies are actually kind of rational, even the titular pair are self-aware of their own stupidity. Sluggy Freelance keeps pulling random new ideas about of nowhere, but the rules about how the setting works are pretty darn consistent. I'm wondering if it's possible to create a goofy kitchen-sink setting like this *on purpose* rather than the usual method of adding more wackiness to an already goofy story as it goes on?

  I haven't read One Piece yet, but from what I've heard about the setting it does a pretty decent job of justifying the weirdness from the get-go. Islands are relatively isolated by weird science rules and sea monsters, random people find Devil Fruits that give them unique superpowers, and the oligarchical government's desire to control everything encourages people to become pirates. The world lends itself to weird adventures and characters with unique backgrounds.

  However, I don't want to rip off One Piece right now. I'd much rather rip off something like Rifts (or the much better Breachworld) where a bunch of extradimensional insanity has been dumped onto Earth and reshaped the world. Base Raiders has an interesting framing device of breaking into abandoned bases that belonged to superheroes in a kitchen-sink comic book universe, but that almost seems too grounded for what I'm trying to do. Any thoughts?

    After careful examination, I have determined that there can be only one logical explanation: Fairy-God-Parents! (When else could I make this reference?) The Fair Folk have long meddled in the affairs of humans, but for centuries their whims have been tempered by the rein of King Oberon. To better navigate the human world, he bonded his life to that of a human who convinced him to leave most humans alone and keep the supernatural a secret from humans. The status quo was stable, until Oberon's avatar died unexpectedly.

    In his honor, the Fair Folk held a funeral for their king the night after the one humans held for his avatar, Henry Stone. Many humans who knew Stone were invited to the event, though most assumed they were dreaming and were returned before morning. However, many of the fairy attendees decided to follow Oberon's example and bind themselves to humans. Our protagonists now have Lovecraftian creatures from Wonderland following them around wanting to do as they say, but having no idea how humans are supposed to act.

    While our heroes are trying to figure out how to handle this sudden change, other fairies have their own plans. King Oberon's not around to enforce his laws and not everyone liked them, so now supernatural forces are loose upon the Earth seeking to optimize their alien values with limited understanding of how to do so. Some humans are also getting wise as to what's going on and trying to use the situation to their own advantage, but have a very limited understand of the fairies they're dealing with. Let the insanity begin!

    I would be totally up for playing the tabletop RPG with this premise, I've got a system that can handle it, and I'm wondering if anyone else would be interested?
