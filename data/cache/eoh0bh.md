  This so good. Anyone notice he has one good eye and one eye that shines blue? Now who does this remind you of? A certain someone that told Cat she will forge a groove for the necessary villain into creation.

  The callback to Kairos is so fucking good.

    Kairos-shmairos. It's fuggin *Zuko*, from the scarred face to the self-hatred.

      When do we get uncle Iroh, or is Cat's wakeleaf her tea, and she will eventually teach him to ride Killian's lightening and speak with the voice of thunder, like Hierarch telling the choirs off?

    > A certain someone that told Cat she will forge a groove for the necessary villain into creation.

    When did he say this? I don't quite recall it.

      “I find it most amusing that your good intentions will haunt this world for centuries to come, if you truly win,” the Tyrant grinned. “Ah, the necessary villain. The hard woman making the hard decisions when trouble has come calling and all others are flinching from what simply *must be done.* I wonder how many atrocities will be poured out of that mould in years to come simply because you scratched that groove deep enough onto the fabric of Creation.”

      I took this from the pgte subreddit, so i dont have the chapter number, but i think its late in book 5.

        Thanks! Good callback.

  Ooh nice. A villain that uses the Light who was Named in attempt to do the right thing by committing an atrocity.

  This kid seems like the first of a new generation for Cat to raise.
  ```

  - u/leakycauldron:
    ```
    I don't think he uses the Light per say. He just twists sorcery to be Light-adjacent
    ```

- u/Frommerman:

  Objectively speaking, the kid saved thousands of lives by sacrificing about a hundred. Given that he couldn't make them listen (and what village elder will listen to a petulent child?), he did do the right thing.

   But he can never know that. To know that his atrocity was the best he could have done, given the circumstance, would lead him into the same trap Tariq has fallen into: that of thinking such atrocities are always justified. Only unlike Tariq, the Scorched Apostate will never have the whispers of the Ophanim to moderate that conviction.

  And so, he will become another Catherine, rather than another Tariq. He will continue to make hard choices, continue to do what will turn out for the best, but he will always have that little ball of doubt in the back of his mind. He will always wonder if it could have been done better, if only a better person, a better tool for the job, had been there. He will always wonder if fewer had to die, had fate seen fit to send a finer tool than him. But he will never see that musing such counterfactuals is pointless, for the world he lives in is the one where he, with his gifts, was sent. He *must* never see that, lest he become convinced that his way is always right.

  That way lies the Throne of the Dread Empire.

  Yet another example of Below emulating Above.  It's learning and adapting.

  First thought:  


  'second invasion (and penultimate)' -> 'second (and penultimate) invasion'  


  Starter-quote must be treated as higher-priority than body text, in terms of impression and error-checking-time-per-percentage...  <smile>  


  Now, to read!

  Ahhh you might be one thing or another, but you're a mage, and you'll be an Apprentice.

- u/aeschenkarnos:
  ```
  It seems that Named get to know what their own Names are.
  ```

  - u/narfanator:
    ```
    I mean they do, yeah. But. Names are also different than roles. And, what I'm seeing is a kid with ridiculously powerful divine sorcery that he doesn't know how to use, and a complex relationship to deities...

    ...and a Hierophant.
    ```

  - u/Oaden:
    ```
    The one time we were in the thoughts of a named coming into one, (Catherine in the first book) we got this thought bubble.

    >Awareness flooded back into me. I was Catherine Foundling, daughter of no one and nothing. I’d fought people for gold once, but earned only silver. I’d taken lives, and justice had come for me with a sword that cried like a grieving man. I was apprenticed to a monster but dreamed of making a world without them. A traitor to all causes but my own, and my path had brought me to this moment: bleeding out on the floor, surrounded by fire.

    >The other claimants were all dead, and I was the Squire.

    So i guess you an update on what you are when you come into your name
    ```

      ```
      We also get a little perspective from Wekesa becoming Warlock:  "Eventually he was able to see again, and he felt his Name fill like a glass of wine " though that doesn't tell us a hell of a lot.
      ```
