  Should be "charms".

  Great chapter!

  Does Harry get a power up in this fic?

    It's Ender's Game-inspired, so he's more skilled as a result of more intensive combat training
    ```

      Interesting... I've been following this story for ages but I hadn't made the connection to Ender's Game and it seems obvious in retrospect.

      In addition to being more skilled as a result of training, Harry is (like Ender) also a bit of a prodigy.

        Seems prodigy by way of nurture, if my reading of the story is correct.

        From my understanding, Harry's state is the result of Snape very specifically manipulating the events of his life to produce the end result rather than something "innate".

        Hints of this when they talk about magical development, expectations based on others adolescent growths, mind magic on Vernon, etc.

          Ah, the old nurture vs. nature debate. I can see where you're coming from. IMHO there's got to be something innate first and then Snape's provided a pressured environment on top of that.
          ```

            I think that's what Snape believes as well. If you look at some of the dialogues between Snape and Mystery Person, it sounds like they specifically chose to make Harry into the perfect commander instead of another candidate for a specific quality he possesses that others don't.
            ```

            - u/LeonCross:
              ```
              The prophecy, likely. Assuming that's still canon here.
              ```
