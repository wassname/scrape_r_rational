## [D] Friday Open Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could (possibly) be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.

  So the "So I'm a Spider, So What?" anime has just released episode 1, and it's looking quite optimistic, apart from the more egregious CGI frog. Especially the opening chock-full of light novel spoilers, oh my. Had me smiling like a buffoon after waiting for it for almost 3 years.

  I'm a huge fan of the series, as it's essentially the only straightforward isekai that isn't a complete mess. Every element and plot device in the story has a purpose, sometimes even 8-9 volumes later, without feeling like an ass-pull or coming out of nowhere. It's what I consider the perfect isekai, although it requires a lot of knowledge and background in isekai to fully appreciate what it does. It's the most rational of all the isekais I've seen with a highly competent MC(comedy aside), although I will admit that is a very low bar to surpass.

  There's a lot of other amazing and competent anime series coming out this season too like Re:Zero S2 Part 2 and Attack on Titan S4, all of which I'm excited for.

    All I'm planning to watch this season is Spider and Mushoku tensei.. I enjoy spider, but I've only read the manga and I must say after that demon king and now this new arc, where it seems she'll be involving herself with human matters, have lowered my interest on it substantially. 

    &#x200B;

    Mushoku Tensei is a bit of a popcorn read I've done and eventually dropped years ago. The author is definitely a discovery writer that doesn't really have a plan. It's very much a 'this story isn't going anywhere, what should I do? ... Oh! I know I'll teleport everyone to a dangerous continent and see what happens'. 

    &#x200B;

    The author had to pull a portal fantasy inside a portal fantasy just to add a plot to his follow along story, how crazy is that? \*inserts comments on lack of creativity, and plot formulation skills\* And this is one of the most successful and highly rated webnovels from japan.

    &#x200B;

    It's interesting as a study on how bad an author can be and still be successful. Although if you can't stand the usual loli harem nonsense commonly seen in japanese works it's a definite pass.

    &#x200B;

    But I must say my overhaul impression and expectation for any japanese novel / manga have been fairly low in the last couple years. It annoys me how good novels on RR many made by amateurs are all virtually better than anything I've seen japan produce in a long time that isn't a comedy..

      It seems to me the problem is that every webnovel or lightnovel or manga creator in japan is desperately trying to get picked up as an anime. So they're all replete with every single stupid, obnoxious trope that exists in popular works , like boob envy, cute critter companion, hair color== personality, incest tension, yanderes, tsunderes, non-emoting==cool, feckless harem lead, neet isekai, and so on and so on. It is basically the ultimate commercial pressure pitfall. 


      Of course it's also possible japan has a thriving indie webnovel/webcomic scene full of original, avant garde works which simply don't get translated because all the translators are pathetic loli obsessed incel weebs.


      Anyway, it leads me to wonder if the western scene is less susceptible to commercial pitfall somehow, or if its going through something similar and I can't see it.

        It's certainly possible but probably not likely. If they ever made something like MoL it'd be the best thing of the decade and be everywhere with hundreds of loop stories popping up for years afterwards.

        &#x200B;

        IMHO One of the potential causes we see so little translated works be good is that people anywhere with a high enough intelligence level will given the chance choose to consume and create content in english.

        &#x200B;

        This leads to a drop in the quality of the content produced there and a boost to the overhaul quality of EN works in general.. 

        &#x200B;

        It could be me projecting, but take for instance my country. 200kk people, more than England and Germany combined and I've seen no good stories coming out of here virtually ever.

        &#x200B;

        Why ? Because if you're intelligent enough you learn the current trade / intellectual language and use it instead.
        ```

        - u/TheTruthVeritas:
          ```
          Now that you mention it, that's very plausible. English is definitely the most important and prominent language, that I'm certain most intelligent or intellect-seeking people would learn. My parents grew up poor in China and always told me that I'm so lucky to be able to live in America, that America is the land of opportunity, and so on. Fits in with the concept of the American Dream too I'd imagine, with people seeking education, opportunity, and wealth all studying English and aiming to live in America. Or perhaps this all just my American-bias speaking.

          By this logic you wouldn't have foreign literatures. It doesn't make much sense, each country is full of its own creators, some good, some bad. And writing in a language you're not a native speaker of doesn't come easily or natural to everyone (I should know...). If anything you could see light novels closer to fanfiction: in many cases, if you're good enough, you might start asking yourself if it wouldn't make more sense to go one step further, aim for a more "respectable" literary career and thus leave the art form to amateurs. The big difference is that fanfiction isn't publishable because of copyright issues and LNs are. But hey, we STILL got "50 shades of grey", which was fanfiction with just the names changed. Anime LN adaptations are like if TV networks made a really successful "50 shades" show and then decided to go dig into everything else and now we had a massive "My Immortal" serial.

            Except statistically countries / languages with higher population are going to again 'statistically' have a higher number (not percentage) of highly intelligent or talented or whatever attribute you deem important to the creation of art.

            Meaning we should, all things being equal, see languages that have a higher number of speakers produce a higher number of 'great works'.

            Nations with higher populations produce a higher total number of scientific discoveries and innovations...

            It's like the most beautiful women in a small town, in a big city she might just be considered pretty or cute, simply because of the total number of people involved. In a way the literature scenes of such small countries likely suffer the same fate. 

            In their home country it might be great to the 40kk people that live there and speak that language, but it might be just above average to an english speaker.

        That's a big JP site for indie works. 400,000 novels over less than 2 decades is decent, although I'm assuming its counting the 95% of works that are unfinished in that number.

        To be honest, I'm assuming the onslaught of trashy publishrd novels coming out of Asia is just a product of what media formats are popular rather than any inherent result of capacity for quality. I mean how many shitty reality tv shows come out in Western countries? Between the economies of scale factors and people growing comfortable with a particularly accessible media format and/or genre, I figure its just how the avenues for creators have ended up.

        Also there's probably a larger audience for "western"/English stuff than any specific Asian country's works, because language barriers and internet access, meaning there's more accumulated energy, money and refinement thrown at the Western stuff. The more feedback on and resources in a medium/community the faster that medium/community can grow past awkwardness.

        I believe the commercial incentives are definitely poison. And there isn't anything inherently bad about cliches, just *do something* with them. Or the characters. It's honestly criminal to me that I'm The Main Character Of A Harem Manga, But I'm Gay So Every Day Is Hell For Me didn't get picked up for a year or two.

        The reclusive safe space where nothing bad ever happens to the MC, the MC is special, and everybody loves everybody else and gets along just great... **that** is the core poison in their scene. 100% conflict aversion. I get that "sad" thoughts aren't the kind people like to dwell on...

        It's just weird that I can't think of anything non-shonen that's a huge franchise with a protagonist-shaped ball of mayonnaise as its lead or zero conflict. Evangelion was supposed to be a deconstruction of these old tropes, decades ago. Madoka Magica is nothing **but** suffering. Konosuba's protagonist is a wonderfully accurate and realistic reflection of the fans that like this stuff, an actual caricature of a person who actually exists, rather than an imaginary mayonnaise person that could never exist.

        The Korean scene seems more aligned with our tastes on the whole.

          As an avid watcher of harem garbage I have to offer some small resistance.

          The charm of the "turn of your mind" atmosphere of these stories is not actually that you get to turn off your mind. Its that you *mostly* get to turn off your mind. See, the trick of doing harem garbage successfully isn't to throw women at your protagonist in an appropriately light-toned color pallette. Its to shrink the pace to such an imperceptible extent that the viewer barely notices that things are happening.

          Take the recent *Hensuki: Are You Willing to Fall in Love With a Pervert, As Long As She`s a Cutie?* anime. Its quintessential harem garbage, with an entire episode devoted to repetitive gags of the girls visiting the protagonist's home to have him pet one like a dog or be tied up by the other. You can just waste hours of your life adoring the simplicity of it all. And yet before you know it the story suddenly becomes a well-told romance for the side character Koharu. Its not so much that its new or exceptional as that, *in relative terms* the shift is so effective that it takes you along with it. Its an art form to softly lead your reader or viewer to see your characters at what feels like an apex of their potential. Its even better if you can succeed at that balancing act of making something beautiful or astonishing seem perfectly normal and unserious.

          I don't think its an isolated phenomena. *OreShura* is a classic in this strain which ended with an unusually passionate harem route. There's *HxH*, which morphed from being the cringiest pseudo-hentai into a low-key meditation on Aine's soul. Of course some do it explicitly with semi-serious stories, like *Maburaho* which takes a whiplash change of pace, but its the same idea- its one of the best I've seen.

  What would be the benefits of being able to read your own mind, the way stereotypical telepaths in movies read others?
  ```

  - u/fljared:
    ```
    Assuming this is more complex than the likely "Microphone in a boombox" scenario:

    * A hopefully intuitive understanding of internal biases and motivations. I'm imagining something like Paul's sense of his desires in With This Ring >!after he becomes enlightened!<

    * With practice, an easier way to change your mind with evidence; It might not make it easy, but if you have a ladle stuck in a drawn it'll be easier to get it out if you a glass countertop.

    * In a scenario with more fictional powers, like subtle mind control or other telepaths, being able to recognize foreign interference would be a big bonus
