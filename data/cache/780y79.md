## Writing and Reading Rational fanfic, where to start?

### Post:

Any highly recommended works for people just starting out? And key things to keep in mind while writing rational fanfic?

    +1, it's also HUGE and only a few months off completion. Well. Early to mid next year maybe?

  It depends on what you like. If you like epic novel length masterpieces, my first recommendation would probably be Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality, although the protagonist is a bit unlikable early in the story and he doesn't act like a normal eleven year old for spoilery reasons so YMMV. That one has an audio version though which is convenient.

  Some other epic novel-length works that might be good to start out with:

  Luminosity

  Pokemon: the Origin of Species

  Animorphs: the Reckoning

  Strong Female Protagonist

  Worm

    Conversely, if you want to dip a toe with some quite short pieces, then the wiki includes A Bluer Shade of White, Three Worlds Collide, and The Last Christmas.

      Also, [Chiang.](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/788o2x/rtrepost_everything_by_ted_chiang/)

      Which reminds me, might be time for a repost of that. I'll do that in a sec.
      ```

    ```
    Note that Origin of Species is a work in progress (updates about every month, I think), and very slow paced - but lots of people, myself included, find it enjoyable enough not to worry too much about plot speed, so YMMV.

    It definitely leans toward the rationalist camp rather than mere rational, demonstrating and exploring techniques of planning, critical thinking, etc. A bit like HPMoR, except gentler, less of a "frustrated with the world" vibe.

    I tried hpmor and got about 30 chapters in

    I couldn't suspend disbelief, not only was Harry thoroughly unlikable even at that point, it seemed too... Forced. Everything happening so conveniently

    And the whole story wrapping up in such a short space of time rather than 7 years and on such an odd cliffhanger left a weird taste in my mouth. Very uncomfortable.

    For people who are already into SciFi/scifa, I'd suggest mother of learning and worth the candle, absolutely fantastically written believable characters and actions.. just a bit Blueball being incomplete lol

  ```
  _A Practical Guide to Evil_ is a fairly interesting piece because it deals, first of all, with medieval fantasy in a refreshingly well-researched manner, second because it deals _explicitly_ with narrativium, the dichotomy between Good/Evil and virtue/consequence ethics, and third because it is not about exploiting magic but rather exploiting _politics._

  As for things to keep in mind: you should really, _really_ learn about realpolitik/power politics. A good way to familiarize yourself with it is to play the board game _Diplomacy._ Ask yourself (often about the villain) "How can this person obtain power? How can they hold power? How can they deny power to others?"

  Worth the candle and Unsong are very good.  If you're looking for an actual novel to read I suggest crystal society.  Or if you're just looking for some fun fanfiction, harry potter and the natural 20.
  ```

  - u/Roxolan:
    ```
    Unsong is very much not rationalfic, just "fic that /r/rational likes" (and connected for historical reasons). I would certainly recommend it in the abstract, just not for OP's specific question.
    ```

    - u/Frommerman:
      ```
      At the very least, the characters of Unsong are very rational given the deeply irrational world they live in. That was one of the more interesting aspects of it, to me.

  HPMoR is the usual recommendation. It’s pretty good but don’t expect much in the way of storytelling, it’s mostly a vehicle for Yudkowsky to spread his ideas. Metropolitan Man and Worm are a lot less teaching oriented, and not as hard-rational, but they’re some of my favorite works of fiction ever, and are pretty good reads.

    So you liked a story but didn't enjoy the story part of it? What part of it did you enjoy then?

    Personally I think HPMOR has pretty great story telling and it's main flaws are 1. Lack of Dudley 2.0 to contrast to adult-intellect HJPEV leading to extreme reader confusion and uncanny valley sensation because they think Harry is supposed to be a genuine eleven year old, 2. the filler; things could be a lot more streamlined if the plot didn't take so many detours, and 3. While some of HJPEV's monologues fit into the story well (such as the one about Milgram's experiments), others feel tacked on (such as the one about family court systems). I think EY might have thought as long as he could tie it back into the story it would fit just fine, but unfortunately things don't work that way.

    It should come up in the story naturally *first* and then you find a way to turn it into a valuable lesson for the reader. If you start with a lesson and then try to work it into the story it doesn't feel as natural. Of course, all things considered I only really realized this because I read HPMOR, so I can hardly blame EY for not realizing it either.

      >So you liked a story but didn't enjoy the story part of it? What part of it did you enjoy then?

      It’s the same issue with Ready Player One. I can acknowledge that something isn’t well written or doesn’t follow conventional storytelling while still enjoying the work as a whole. I thought it was an enjoyable experience because EY’s writing is enjoyable TO ME.

  Some things I've tried to keep in mind while (occasionally :v) writing my own ratfic are the tenets on the sidebar:

  The plot should be driven by consequences, the characters by their motivations, and the world should be consistent. There isn't a lot more to it, really, but it's harder to pull off than it might seem.

  A good example is what I call the "Captain Planet" principle - that nobody actually does evil just for its own sake, and those characters that do aren't usually very compelling. Nobody is going to make the planet radioactive just for the sheer heck of it. A level further is that while you CAN make a villain out of pure nihilism - i.e. "this world is beyond saving/has nothing of worth in it/WHY DIDN'T YOU LOVE ME JENOVA" - that's not much better than the 'for the hell of it" option. imo, a good villain should seek to change the world just like a good protagonist would - according to their values and ideals. Everyone is the hero of their own story - even in a story ;D

  Sorry if this is a little (a lot) rambling, but I've been thinking about this sort of thing a lot lately.

  There are a lot of different things that come underneath a 'rational' umbrella. If you let us know more about what sort of books you like, it might be useful to get something more closely calibrated to your specific tastes.

  That said...

  [*Unsong*](http://unsongbook.com/) by Scott Alexander is a funny but also quite interesting book (with a few extremely dark sections). It's like Douglas Adams (*Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy*) in some respects, but also bears some resemblance to Robert Anton Wilson (*The Illuminatus! Trilogy*) in places. 

  [Short Stories](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/56ndwt/rtrepost_everything_by_ted_chiang/) by Ted Chiang are fantastically written; each story is centered around a new idea and suggests a ton of interesting things. One of his stories became the science fiction film *Arrival*; all of them are worth reading.

  [Benedict](http://archiveofourown.org/users/Benedict_SC/pseuds/Benedict_SC) has written a couple longer novels; CORDYCEPS is a horror-themed rationalist-adjacent story that is both wonderful and deeply horrifying while being fully original, while The World As It Appears To Be is a fanfic piece that uses Overwatch's characters and background as a starting point to go towards entirely new places. 

  [Nostalgebraist](https://archiveofourown.org/users/nostalgebraist/pseuds/nostalgebraist) wrote two different stories that are of particular interest; The Northern Caves is an original epistolary story of horror that is very weird and difficult to explain but very worthwhile, while Floornight has some thematic similarities to Neon Genesis Evangelion but is otherwise original and also extremely weird and good.
