  Heh. I see where this is going.

  And thusly it was proved that Ngo is a demon.

    Is it possible that she's the equivalent of a fallen angel? A raised demon? Probably not, but stranger things have happened in the UN-iverse.
    ```

    - u/electrace:

      I was definitely getting the sense that Ngo is one of those characters that is implied to be the bad guy, only to be revealed to be the good guy later on.
      ```

        Ngo has to be similar to Jane (at least in terms of the amount of trouble Scott was *really* in when she captured him) because that's how the vanishing name works.
        ```

        - u/LiteralHeadCannon:
          ```
          I thought Jane was the Ana equivalent?
          ```

            Oh. i saw it as "held hostage by Ngo" vs "held hostage by  jane"

            But i guess "saved by Anna from Ngo" vs "Saved by Jane from military forces" works too
            ```

  I am updating the wiki, specifically the chapter pages.  My current plan is to include the following sections:

   - Title (eg. Dark Satanic Mills is from William Blake's *And did those feet in ancient time*, and is a reference to the industiral revolution destroying relationships.)
   - Characters (both main viewpoint, and others mentioned)
   - Time/chronology.
   - Plot summary.

  Anything I should add or remove?

  I made a post in /r/UNSONG over [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/unsong/comments/4suxo7/updating_the_wiki/) to keep the comments consolidated.

    Am not totally knowledgeable on this, but it kind of bothered me because I thought the militarization of the police was a primarily post-9/11 thing.
    ```

    - u/alexanderwales:
      ```
      Arguably started in the 60s with the creation of SWAT, but also arguably didn't start until the 80s and the war on drugs. 9/11 didn't help, nor did postwar military surplus being sold to police departments.

      It did feel a little anachronistic to me.
      ```

      - u/Cruithne:
        ```
        It could be that other events in their universe militarised them even more than in ours. Also there does seem to be some kind of weird convergence/yoking going on between their world and ours.
        ```

        - u/alexanderwales:
          ```
          Honestly, I just try my best not to think about Unsong's alternate history too much.
          ```

        - u/sir_pirriplin:
          ```
          Especially with the slow disintegration of the Federal Government. The kind of thing the National Guard used to do probably became responsibility of the local and state police departments.
          ```
