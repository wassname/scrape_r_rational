  WOOP!

  Lesath became a transhumanist!

  I think I might actually do a little dance later when nobody is looking, this makes me so happy!

  Is "Xare" a reference to something, or does it have some other meaning?

    ```
    The only thing I can think of is a reference to some neutral pronouns, I can't find anything else.

  Not quite as good as the previous chapters, I think, but I still look forward to where the story goes from here. It's been a little while since we've heard from Voldemort, I think ...

  Glad to see Lesath, though. And a good point from /u/ArisKatsaris in the HPMOR thread:

  >Also I feel that Harry's "to control Dementors" is somewhat badly expressed, if Harry's supposed to be expressing the truth of what happened here.
  "to fight against Dementors" or "to protect against Dementors" seems more accurate than "to control Dementors".

  It's been so long since I've read HPMoR, but it was never actually tested that telling someone that Dementors are Death makes them incapable of casting a normal Patronus right? Harry has just deduced this from, I don't know what evidence would suggest it would disappear, right? That's assuming that people believe him about the Patronus and that their brains are able to comprehend (and by this I am noting the difference between hearing something and really feeling knowledge of it) it on top of that.

  How does the Patronus know to go to older Harry rather than younger Harry? They're both around when Dumbledore casts the spell

  >Did I teach her a spell to control Dementors, which can only be used by those who truly care about others?

  Holy no true Scotsman batman. You could selfishly hate Death. I suppose you can forgive him because there's plenty of very good fallacies and lies which are much better than honest rational thought at convincing people but still

  >Dementors, to bring an end to the ceaseless suffering the government of magical Britain inflicts on its prisoners, a use that was almost certain to kill her? 

  I'm curious if as I commented on the last chapter, anyone is going to start wondering how he knows it was certain to kill her.

    > You could selfishly hate Death.

    Quirrel supposedly can't cast it. Invoking Death of the Author for a moment, I don't actually think it's about hating Death per se. 

    "Ignore bad things, think happy thoughts" = animal patronus

    "see bad things, feel bad" = no patronus

    "See bad things, and thing happy thoughts about *ending the bad things*" = human patronus

    Death is just the largest, most horrific example of "bad thing people try to ignore" that Harry (and the Authors, if they weren't both under the DotA clause) believes exists in reality, and thus the Dementors symbolize Death more than they symbolize other types of suffering. 

    A person who wants to end their *own* suffering is not the same as a person who wants to end *suffering in general*. 

    >I'm curious if as I commented on the last chapter, anyone is going to start wondering how he knows it was certain to kill her.

    This doesn't explain how he knows, but I think that if he didn't at the very least *believe* the human Patronus was extremely dangerous to the user, the Phoenix wouldn't have come to him when he was considering using it on the Azkaban Dementors.
