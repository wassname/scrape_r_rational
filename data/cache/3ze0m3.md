  "You know you're a redneck if..." Combined with rationalist memes and horror.

    ```
    >You abandon a sunk cost. You didn’t want to. It’s crying.

    *...Oh.*
    ```

  ```
  It is the singularity. You have one brain, one eye, one finger, one testicle, one foot, one toe, one ovary, one, one, one, one, one....
  ```

- u/Transfuturist:
  ```
  >You’re struggling with akrasia. You have insight into your condition. You pity people who don’t even know to call it “akrasia”. You have not done anything in months.

  Too spoop.
  ```
