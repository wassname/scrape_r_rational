      If you're okay with a classic, read the short story [Nyarlathotep](http://www.hplovecraft.com/writings/texts/fiction/n.aspx) (Lovecraft). It's not very long either and definitely fits this theme.

      The first part is funny enough to stand on its on.

        Myself, I think it's even better with the second.

  Written several years ago by cptsdcarlosdevil, aka Ozy; I noticed it'd never been posted here and decided to correct that failing.

  Is it me or is the ending a little abrupt? Like there's no transition between "aragorn is sticking to his precommitment" to "argorn is suddenly planning to turn on the others (for their own good)".
  ```

- u/Modularva:
  ```
  Great ending.
  ```
