  I was really hoping there'd be a callback to the bird prank. Like, I'm not sure it actually makes sense that Anton would remember that minor interaction with a random hobo he met, what, months ago?, but it's super entertaining so I'll allow it.

    I mean, it sounded like a very memerable interaction to me.

  Given the spoilers posted here I think I'm going to drop this story. It isn't any one factor that makes it frustrating but a combination of a massive number of small problems. The primary problem is the pacing of the plot vs the amount of time between chapters and the very short nature of the chapters content wise. Sure there are like 5000 words a chapter but those words don't end up getting you anywhere. And the content we are spending words on is both the worst aspect of the author, primarily character development, and the worst thing to not be concise with, character development.

  There's "slow burn" and then there's "no spark".

  Is every Guildie as malicious as the Crimson Swords? The first thing they think of when seeing other Awakened is killing them in their sleep and betraying them, and it’s clear they killed quite a few people, at least with Anton and Hegar. Not to mention their overt hostility. Anton and Hegar are incredibly shady, malicious, and dangerous. Anton was literally about to shoot Rain. Kinda worried in that department.

  It’s starting to make me think Rain is even more inept than I thought. Any meeting with these loose cannons without a solid plan could potentially be a mess, if they decided to attack and kill Ascension they’d lose most of their members if not all of them, especially when they don’t have any of their high level members like Amelia or Tallheart around to easily stomp them. What is going on here? It’s so risky and it feels like Rain is still naively hoping everyone is cooperative and friendly in a proven hostile and medieval world, you’d think he’d learn after Velika literally killed most of the Awakened in Fel Sadanis.

  I’d personally have been very worried and have both Carten and either Amelia or Tallheart with everybody to shut them down in case they attack, and given their behavior and thoughts, that’s not too unlikely. And set up a contingency plan to kill them later as their reputation in Vestvall isn’t exactly the most reputable, or maybe I’m just the crazy murderous psycho here. Is it just me?

  And just what the hell is Amelia doing? She knows they’re about to meet a trio of 3 DPS adventurers that are all higher level than everybody else in Ascension except Tallheart, why would she suddenly fly off to some mountain and not return before her expected time and ensure nothing goes wrong? Unless there’s a very good reason for all this, I think it’s a big idiot ball moment, but fortunately this isn’t a tragic or super serious novel where mistakes get punished.

  Delve has been marketed as a rational and number-crunching optimization litrpg isekai, yet these chapters I feel more and more dissatisfied. Rain is completely inept at managing his company and does nothing to mitigate risks, among many other flaws like still not telling Amelia he likes her after all the shit he’s gone through, cringe-y dialogue, and a completely farcical method of introducing democracy and leading.

  Case in point, I felt so paranoid this whole chapter that something bad was going to happen. Perhaps it’s because I’ve read too many shitty xianxia and webnovels where people murder at the drop of a hat, or maybe it’s just me. All it takes is one decently leveled unhinged psycho to ruin Rain’s company and dreams, and given the technological level of the world and people like Velika and the Empire, there are a lot of high leveled pyschos in the world. Anybody else feel this way?

  Looking forward to the next chapter, I suppose.

    > Is every Guildie as malicious as the Crimson Swords? 

    Nope. Spoiler for latest patron chapter >!it's discovered they're murdering other guild members for accolades, something so heavily against guild law that it carries the death penalty. So far worse than average.!< 

    But overall xachariah has it right. Power does corrupt, there's a reason the Watch exists entirely to police high level characters.

    >All it takes is one decently leveled unhinged psycho to ruin Rain’s company and dreams

    >!Talheart brings this up in the latest patron chapter. His view is that Rain actually is too low level to run something like Ascension, but he and Rain both agree that it was the least bad option given the circumstances of a destroyed city. So they agree Talheart will take them blue hunting to try and make the best of things.!<

    As a Patreon reader, let me warn you, it only gets worse. After the most recent few chapters, I'm done reading this. Maybe I'll go back and try it again after it's a lot further, but it's too annoying at the moment.

        It was, yeah. It still seemed too late to me. This is the second time now that Rain has had this revelation that he's too weak to keep people safe. It's not clear why we needed dozens of chapters and a series of stupid actions by the main character to rehash the same exact character building ideas a second time.
        ```

  - u/RiOrius:
    ```
    > And just what the hell is Amelia doing?

    Bailing.

    She's been terrified of losing someone she cares about ever since her father died at a young age, so she's never allowed herself to grow attached to people. All her life she's moved around, never staying long with one party or making friends. And now she's realized she's grown too close to Rain and others in Ascension and that scares her.

    So she tried to bail. Left her Ascension cloak behind and everything. Didn't even say goodbye, just flew off. But then she made a Crystal Slime on a whim and it didn't fist bump her and she apparently realized she it's too late, she's already grown attached and is now coming back.

    Yeah, it's kind of Idiot Bally, but at the same time, Ameliah has been the most competent character in the story since literally chapter one. This is quite possibly the first mistake we've seen her make, ever, it's one that has had very little in the way of actual consequences (he said, ominously; not a Patron, please no spoilers), and it's one she's rectifying on her own. It's kinda heavy handed, but it is nice to see that the Perfect Jack isn't actually perfect.
    ```

    - u/zorianteron:
      ```
      I mean, it's idiot ball-y, but it's also her questioning her motivations and so forth and finding out what she actually wants, with the shame of wanting to flee not letting her be explicit about making the decision and keeping to it.  I kind of like it.
      ```

    - u/DanPOP123:
      ```
      kind of Idiot Bally.

      how is it, Idiot Bally it makes perfect sense for her character and she has been shown to be good at being a guilder not been shown to be emotionally stable.
      ```

      - u/kaukamieli:
        ```
        It would be a bit different if she wouldn't leave just before a dangerous situation. It makes it look like she wants them to die, or lose at least.
        ```

  - u/xachariah:
    ```
    >Is every Guildie as malicious as the Crimson Swords?

    Take any three men, take away all police or authority, and give them superpowers that make them absolutely untouchable over 751 people living in a city, and by comparison those three are saints.  And if you think people aren't like that because you think you could be trusted with that power, imagine how much you'd trust just giving your bank card and pin number to three strangers on the street and expecting them to be moral enough not to take advantage.

    That this city isn't their own little Lord of the Flies fiefdom says good things about them.  That's what the conversation before the scene change is about, where Rain is getting information to see if they're ultimately good people or not and they *did* save his life.



    Rain & Co is their biggest threat to life they've seen in a while.  So gathering more information and having a plan to kill him makes sense.  It's only trying to follow through with it that makes it psycho.

  >!I´m not a patreon but i read up to 134. The fight in ch133 is really bad writing. Forcing the conflict in a disadvantageous position with only Rain (a meh support) is the peak of stupidity and completly out of character from Ameliah. Are u telling me that 2 rational and competent people dindt discuss how to solve the crimson sword problem? if Ameliah was so set in fighting them Rain should know about it and support her beacause she is more experienced in such things. Why the fuck did they not fight next to their wall and with all the range combatants of the company to support them? why Rain was outside? Why Ameliah was so ill prepeared for the fight? everything that happened in ch133 reeks of bad plot device to get the love-birds badly injured. hell, even with preparation and an advantageous fight could end up all roughly the same with TH saving the day but actually being believable instead of the clusterfuck of bad writing it all ended up being.!<

  This fiction dont have many good things going on for it but this was fucking stupid and the poorest resolution i saw in a long time. SS should get an editor ASAP and if he had it, then find someone better because an editor is there for making the author not falling for this kind of shit.
  ```

  - u/cthulhusleftnipple:
    ```
    100%. The whole situation in chapter 133-134 is just stupid and breaks any appeal of these characters for me. I did feel like chapter 135 *slightly* improved the situation with Rain taking his immense shittyness seriously, but it's not enough. The whole thing felt like a setup to try and make Rain's pivot in attitude be more serious, but it's way too late for that to quite work. The author can't keep doing these *'and now the main character has learned his faults and takes things seriously'* pivots and not have it just seem like bad writing, especially this late in the book.
    ```

  - u/TheTruthVeritas:

    That’s disappointing to hear. I’m sure many of us like Delve because it was originally one of the more rational litrpg isekais with an actual focus on optimizing builds instead of the usual lazy shit we see.

    These chapters though, I feel Rain is getting more and more inept and irrational. From literally forcing democracy down people’s throats(not a good way to teach and sell people on something new, asshole!) and now completely dropping the ball on the combat and planning aspects too.

    I don’t know the specifics of what you’re talking about, but it’s clear the Crimson Swords are definitely a major and risky potential threat. Rain has done zero preparations and countermeasures against these unknowns besides hoping things don’t go to shit. Like Jesus Christ man, it shouldn’t be this hard too for what is presumably a fight against the Crimson Swords, all you need is to bring Amelia, Tallheart, and Carten around, and perhaps keep the ranged, support, and healing members at a distance.

    At this point I’ve read JP isekai series that are more rational and competent than Delve and Rain.

    These chapters definitely aren't the story at it's best, but I don't think they were really that bad.  A lot of the stupidity can be reasonably explained in-character.

    >!The MCs didn't know these guys were plate hunters, after all.  Without all those Accolades, they wouldn't have been nearly as much of a threat.  Ameliah might have been able to take on all three of them if it weren't for that.  Not knowing about the plate hunting also led to the the MCs underestimating these guys' willingness to commit to a fight to the death.  I interpreted Ameliah's actions as more of a threat display than an actual plan to start shit, not realizing that these guys were more than willing to go all in, even if it risked their lives and even if they didn't know what their opponents were capable of.!<

  Hearing what I've been hearing about the recent patreon chapters, althought I'm not a sub, has been making me want to drop this story.

  I've been reading it for the worldbuilding and the rational actions, and both are mostly gone in favor of shitty romance and lucky coincidences. Once Rain starts acting competent again (I don't care if he gets a blue or not, the lack of them is reasonable) then I'll repick up the story. Does RemindMeBot still exist?

  Getting tired of the will they won't they Amelia/Rain. 

  Dude can start a company/guild, stand up to gold plates, risk his life in battle,  and politic with world powers, but not tell a girl he likes her.

    I think you forget that they already had a talk about it, many chapters before, when they were going to the mine lair. She said she isn't looking for anyone atm.

  Could a Patreon leave me a spoiler or pm about the latest patreon chapter, whats the progress X amount of chapters later?

  I'm not feeling the chapters lately and want to see if something changes.

  - u/steelong:
    ```
    >!Some shenanigans from the last chapter result in Rain having many new Accolades (although we don't know what most of them are yet), and also deciding to get Tallheart and Ameliah to take him into the Depths so he can finally start leveling again.  He hasn't begun that venture yet, but he might start leveling again in the next few real-time months.  He's also lost a great deal of that pesky naivete that has been turning me off the character for so long.  I'm probably happier about him growing up than I am about the potential for System progress.!<
