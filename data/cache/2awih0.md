## [Q][WIP][HSF][RT] S.I.: Is there a psychologist in the house?

### Post:

Or a psychiatrist, or psychotherapist, or any other form of p-doc who has a deeper understanding of the general topic than can be gained via Wikipedia?

I'm in the middle of writing a story in which the protagonist is experiencing all sorts of stresses, and if I can, I'd like to include the appropriate psychological technobabble. Maybe even get some advice on how she might be able to deal with what's going on in her life without going, I believe the technical term is, bug nuts.

So: Does anyone in this forum have a friend of a friend who might be willing to help out an amateur authour?
