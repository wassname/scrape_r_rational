## [RT][DC][HF] In Fire Forged, my AU Naruto story, has finally started updating regularly

### Post:

Hey again, guys!

A while ago I [posted](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/22onyj/hfdcwip_i_would_like_to_show_you_something_ive/) the first two chapters of a story I've been working on for quite a while. I've now started updating it regularly, on a bi-weekly basis.

I hesitate to call it an explicit rational-fic - but considering later themes and other people's willingness to apply the term in the other thread, then I think it's perhaps fair enough to call it that.

The story description is as follows:

*In a world where modern physics and chakra are seemingly irreconcilable, fifteen year old Haruno Sakura graduates as a first-grade genin with the year's highest academic scores and is thrust into a world that is perhaps more complex and a lot less nice than she would have thought at first.*

Cheers!

  Bi-weekly. nice. Which one is that again? Twice a week or once every two weeks? No nevermind. I'll look it up.

  ...

  bi·week·ly adjective \(ˌ)bī-ˈwē-klē\

  : happening every two weeks

  : happening twice a week

  ...

  WTF is wrong with the English language?

  Though you say on the page itself that you update on Sundays so that clears up the ambiguity.

  I like all the characters in this story. Naruto's got that willingness to escalate in defense of his friends, Sakura's got that tendency to analyze problems and solve them using outside-context solutions, and I have no clue what Izanami's deal is but I'm sure she'll also become very very cool in time.

  In short: keep it up! I'm putting this one in my faves folder.

  Enjoyed it quite a bit. You seem to be avoiding overpowering your characters nicely, so far at least. 

  Wish I could read another 20 chapters or so, but eh.

    It's coming! I wish I'd written more as well. There are quite a few of the things and scenes and chapter outlines that I've got planned out that I can barely wait to get around to writing :D
