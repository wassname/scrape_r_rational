## The Great Filter. What if [discussion]

 Warning. Below is spoilers. 




Given the conundrum of that every time travel is murder of everything, killing one more person is irrelevant.

Would you perform the following?
After the first time-travel where you wrote into another persons brain, would you continue this trend, developing time-travel, waiting to see who is the next best competitor, checking to see if they are not you and then overwriting their brain one second after you were sent back? thus having one extra person who is 'you' and dedicated to seeing who else is on the cutting edge of technology and going to develop time travel.

At what point would you be able to bypass the filter by having sufficient experts in the field actively ensuring other people do not time-travel or by creating a general purpose AI that can take over or by finding a way of preventing time-travel etc etc.

How would you bypass the filter?

  The main problem is that we need to find a way to improve our situation between resets.

  While its technically true the infinite series with a termination state eventually terminate; in practice not really.

  Consider these two math problems

  1: if you flip a heads increase x by 2 else decrease it by 1; if x falls below zero, everyone dies

  2:roll a dice, if 1-4 increase x by 10, if 5 decrease by 1 if 6 set x to 0; if x falls below zero everyone dies

  While situation 1 has a 50% dieing on the first turn, if you make it past turn 5 or so your set and the chance of dying decreases at an absurdly low rate

  while situation 2 ... death is *always* 2 turns away, it doesn't matter if surviving the first turn is a 5/6 chance, long term success is far far lower.

  This means, being the ones who control the time travel and using it. Perhaps you should try to prevent brain emulation form being funded, when ever you find its funded you reset with your memories. Which is potentially a very shitty life.

  edit// maybe you should release a plague, force people into a digital life, where your to only person with access to the necessary quantum tools to make a time travel thingy and reset very few centuries just to prevent other civilizations form popping up 

  edit2// Wait fuck, waiting centuries means an alien civ probably is cycling time travel as well; upping your failure rate to a situation 2 setup.

  .... You have to cycle realities quickly as well or find a way to communicate ftl with an alien species that also have the tech or disable their time travel.

    I'd be very skeptical of the relevance of an alien civilization with this technology. After all, the chances of two species creating it at what is essentially the _exact_ same time in cosmological terms is surely orders of magnitude smaller than there being a timeline that once existed where they did exist at the same time that as we did.
