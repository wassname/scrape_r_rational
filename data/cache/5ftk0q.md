## [Biweekly Challenge] Sherlock Holmes

### Post:

## Last Time

[Last time,](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5dd49p/biweekly_challenge_magic_systems/?sort=confidence) the prompt was "Magic Systems". The winner was /u/owenshen24 with their story, [Equations in Meditations](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5dd49p/biweekly_challenge_magic_systems/dac8mdz/?sort=confidence). Go read it now!

##### This Time

This time, the challenge will be **Sherlock Holmes**. Sherlock Holmes is widely regarded as being Hollywood rational; he pulls together clues from bascially nowhere and jumps to all sorts of conclusions which happen to be correct even though there's not enough evidence to actually support them. Your challenge, should you choose to accept it, is to write a Sherlock Holmes story. Or, since prompts are to inspire but not to limit, write something else around the central theme.

The winner will be decided **Wednesday, December 14th.** You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

##### Rules

* 300 word minimum, no maximum. Post as a link to Google Docs, pastebin, Dropbox, etc. **This is mandatory.**

* No plagiarism, but you're welcome to recycle and revamp your own ideas you've used in the past.

* Think before you downvote.

* Winner will be determined by "best" sorting.

* Winner gets reddit gold, special winner flair, and bragging rights. Five-time winners get even more special winner flair, and their choice of prompt if they want it.

* All top-level replies to this thread should be submissions. Non-submissions (including questions, comments, etc.) belong in the companion thread, and will be aggressively removed from here.

* Top-level replies must be a link to Google Docs, a PDF, your personal website, etc. It is suggested that you include a word count and a title when you're linking to somewhere else.

* In the interest of keeping the playing field level, please refrain from cross-posting to other places until after the winner has been decided.

* No idea what rational fiction is? [Read the wiki!](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index)

##### Meta

If you think you have a good prompt for a challenge, [add it to the list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B6HaZc8FYkr6l6Q4cwBc9_-Yq1g0f_HmdHK5L1tbEbA/edit?usp=sharing) (remember that [a good prompt is not a recipe](http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/prompts?src=RECIPE)). Also, if you want a quick index of past challenges, I've [posted them on the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/weeklychallenge).

##### Next Time

Next time, the challenge will be **The Gamer**. Your protagonist (or antagonist, or at least one of the characters in your story) has some or all of the abilities of a character from a video game or possibly board game. [This manhwa](http://www.webtoons.com/en/fantasy/the-gamer/ep-1/viewer?title_no=88&episode_no=1) is where the phrase comes from, though the concept predates it. The most popular take on it is probably [The Games We Play](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/rwby-the-gamer-the-games-we-play-disk-five.341621/), a now-complete crossover with RWBY. Feel free to completely ignore those examples and go in your own direction. Remember that prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

**Next challenge's thread will go up on 12/14.** Please private message me with any questions or comments. The companion thread [is available here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5ftn68/challenge_companion_sherlock_holmes/)
