  Why there is so much FIM in r/rational ?

    This OP in particular has been... I don't want to say *spamming* or anything, but, let's say, *aggressively active* in linking anything even remotely relevant to the subreddit for a while now.

    If the mods are allowing it, I guess it's fine.

    Any recursive fanfic of FiO does not require further explanation.

    Correcting for that, I don't see an exceptional number of FiM fics in /r/rational. It's a prolific fandom, and at a glance has about as much presence as Pokemon. Possibly you just notice it more?

      >glance has about as much presence as Pokemon

      So you're saying that Pokemon is as much well known as FiM?

      hmm, I always tought that Pokemon is well known to almost everybody, while FiM is an obscure cartoon
      ```

        Fair point. It *is* disproportionate. I don't think it's an /r/rational phenomenon though, FiM is just a super active online fandom (or was? I don't know if the cartoon ending caused a drop). I don't know why. Well, I have just-so explanations but they're untestable.
