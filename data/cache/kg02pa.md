  N. K. Jemisin just published a badass book called *The City We Became* this year about the avatars of the boroughs of NYC awakening to fight off an extradimensional threat. It's fucking cool, and the audiobook has the best production quality/sound editing of any I've ever listened to (which is a lot).

    That's perfect because I have so many audible credits collecting virtual dust

      Enjoy it. That book is a treat. Jemisin won a Macarthur Genius grant this year too, well deserved.

    Any recommendation for a good starting book? Or even an order of reading.

  Pact/Pale (by Wildbow) is a worthy mention. Obviously Wildbow doesn't write 100% rational stuff, but one feature of all his stories is the extent to which the worlds are explained using logically consistent rules, and Pact/Pale (which are set in the same world, but disconnected from each other) are no exception.

  I especially like how he explains the masquerade, which is IMO the hardest thing to get right about urban fantasy: everyone, from humans to supernatural creatures, are incentivized to keep the existence of magic secret for a bunch of really good reasons. Particularly interesting is Karma, because for everyone you bring in you're responsible for some of the negative Karma they gain, which means both that you don't want to bring in too many people, and that you want to carefully vet the people that you do bring in.

  Also they have Wildbow's usual standard of interesting powers and characters whose motivations are thought through and shown well, but that goes without saying. Pact is a bit too intense throughout for a lot of people's taste and doesn't do a great job of showing off a lot of the cool worldbuilding it sets up, but Pale makes up for both those problems and was intended to do so without requiring people to read Pact first.

    Thanks for the recommendation!

      Saying Pact is intense is an understatement imo. It's intense in the same way Arc 7-8 in Worm is intense. Imagine that level of stress carried on through the whole novel.

        The best way to describe Pact is an extended million word fight scene, but not one of those martial arts ones. It's the fight scenes where the hero gets stabbed three times in the stomach, and half the fight is just exhausted, sweaty men trying to stand up because they are that tired and in pain, and by the end of the scene he's killing the other guy by drowning him in a blocked urinal.

  I definitely enjoyed Seanan McGuire's InCryptid books. They get better with every book, and the (crypto)zoologists actually do (crypto)zoology!

  I'll toss in the Rivers of London series, which follows a young British Policeman as he is launched into the world of supernatural crime, British wizardry, and local gods.

  Part urban fantasy, part police procedural, this series is a great companion to the Dresden Files. It has many of the other series' charms, with very few of its flaws (power creep, male fantasy, deus ex machina).

  The audiobooks are truly among my very favorite; the voice actor really personifies the MC in a way that few Voice Actors can.

  The worldbuilding is strong and deep, the banter is snappy and witty, the characters are realistically flawed and human, and each book manages a tidy plot while tying in with a larger story arc. The series is less rational and more rational-adjacent. 

  8/10 would recommend to any Urban fantasy fan.

  Diane Duane's [*Young Wizards* series](https://ebooks.direct/collections/this-weeks-bestsellers/products/young-wizards-new-millennium-editions-9-volume-box-set) remains my all-time favorites, and are certainly rational modern fantasy.  /r/errantry has somewhat more details, or at least links in the sidebar :-)

  If Iâ€™m allowed to plug my own work briefly: The Daily Grind is a modern exploration of how normal people would react to the discovery of a classical D&D style dungeon. Except the dungeon looks like an eternity of cubicles, and the monsters are staplers. 

  First few chapters are iffy, but the writing does improve over time quite a lot.

  China Mieville does awesome stuff. Maybe not rational, purely, but just really smart stuff. Would definitely recommend if you are looking for a novel, rather than fan fiction.

  [Black Sun's Daughter series](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4476999-unclean-spirits) by MLN Hanover a.k.a Daniel Abraham (writes The Expanse as James S.A. Corey and some stuff under his own name).

  Cover makes it look generic but it's definitely rational.

  I highly recommend the Skullduggery Pleasant series.
  It's urban fantasy with some pretty impressive magic being thrown around. Plus you get some nice scenes where the book goes "OK so we know how this is a trope in books, so we going to specifically not do that." which is pretty nice.
  Some examples of magic being used:

  Flying, walking in walls, teleportation, fireballs, folks getting their head ripped off then putting it back on with blood magic and regenerating the damage, true name magic, etc.
