  >END | CONCLUSION: STASIS

  Well good story guys, well worth a read. I have to say I enjoy the almost antagonistic nature of this story. I checked the synopsis when it started talking about that (I had largely forgotten it) and there's a sense of fun in being held almost accountable by what you're reading.

  Let's hope the author writes something else in the future.

  I was thinking about the author concluding the story early during the first two chapters, it actually is a reasonable solution to the Author Problem TM which is my term for the unlikeliness of a new serial writer.

  If the author has already finished writing the story and is just faking it being a serial then it's much more plausible in my opinion. Whether that's more plausible than t3 being another author or a genuine first time serial writer who is just managing it by skill is up to the reader.

  Also, the author can apparently edit any comments on wordpress which is insane and now makes every comment on that site suspect (obviously sockpuppets are a thing so they weren't exactly reliable before but still).

  Some days since this appears to have ended, my remaining lingering feeling is regret that I never had a opportunity to try to deduce a Sludging culprit in this fiction.

  That and playful Vned thoughts:  "Wouldn't it make more sense to let each of them out as soon as they could telepathically ask to?  And wouldn't that allow the also-fun outcome of someone finally, much much longer than anyone had ever endured that experience for, asking about her and the organisation finally realising that she was still in there?"
