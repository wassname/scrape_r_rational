Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  Read [Skitterdoc](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/skitterdoc-2077.109765/reader/) from a recommendation last week, it was a pretty fun read and exploration into the CP2077 world. The routine gets a bit repetitive though but its not a bad crossover. I personally wished to see more of the alternative storyline as that would have sounded fun. I'll second last week's recommendation for anyone wanting to read a Worm crossover

    \+1 Skitterdoc is one of the top "tailor isekai" stories IMO.

  Does anyone have recommendations for isekai stories where the protagonist goes native? I've always found it strange when someone will live an almost equal amount of time in their new world yet it supposedly has almost zero effect on their worldview or sense of self. People moving 100 miles away from their hometown in our world tends to have more of an effect on their worldview than reincarnating and growing up in a new world in these stories, which is pretty silly.
  ```

    Seconding *Going Native*. It's a pretty extreme crossover.

    I can think of a couple good Naruto isekais where this happens. [Compass of Thy Soul](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13338339/1/Compass-of-thy-Soul) and its sequel are amazing. [Sanitize](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12431866/1/Sanitize) was also pretty good in a different way.
    ```

    - u/Darkpiplumon:
      ```
      I remember Compass of Thy Soul as good, but maybe too focused on Japanese culture for me, and bashing the Senju too much. Having read other stories from the same author, it looks like bashing is just part of their writing style.

      Sanitize is pretty good. I hope I get to read the ending before I die.

    In some ways dune is like this, from what I've heard about it. Not sure though.
    ```

    - u/CaramilkThief:
      ```
      Dune is about a protagonist who is prophesized to go native. I recommend reading to the end of book 2 to get the proper ending to book 1. The rest are preference. I read up to book 4 and felt that it was a nice place to end.

    [Enough with This Slow Life! I was Reincarnated as a High Elf and Now I'm Bored!](https://mangadex.org/title/8280b28c-aeff-4f89-ac99-a4c783e14782/enough-with-this-slow-life-i-was-reincarnated-as-a-high-elf-and-now-i-m-bored)

    It's a manga, but it fits. Although, the guy has gone so native that him being a reincarnation really doesn't factor into the story all that much. 

    Also, despite it's name, it's still a slice of life story.
    ```

  - u/CaramilkThief:
    ```
    [Going Native](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13398050/1/Going-Native-Complete) is a DC/DBZ crossover where the protagonist (from earth) is reincarnated into a saiyan family. He has to go native or die. 

    Ar'kendrythist protagonist also goes native, although it takes much less time for him to decide to stay. And yeah his worldview is... extremely challenged by the new world.

  A while ago someone recommended this, I'm about halfway through what's currently available and I'd recommend it too.

  I recommend [Raise](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/14043289/1/Raise). It's a RWBY fanfic where Jaune gets the power to resurrect people. What I liked about it is that it's about the economics and geopolitics of someone getting such a powerful power. Once his power gets out, Jaune overnight becomes the most famous person in the world. Suddenly everyone wants Jaune to revive their dead family members, and nations want to sponsor or even kidnap jaune for his power. People no longer quite look at jaune as a person, but for his power. An interesting way to look at it, although the drama of it can get a bit much at times.

  It's not fully rational, but I'd argue it's rational adjacent. Jaune is a 15 year old thrust into heavy responsibility and purpose and fame, and that causes him a lot of stress. He doesn't always make the best decisions, because he literally doesn't know how to make good decisions under such responsibility and fame, so has to learn through painful mistakes. The way society in general receives Jaune felt pretty rational and well reasoned, although early on there was a lot of drama that sometimes felt a bit much. Overall it's a rec from me, if you can handle teenagers acting authentically cringy while the adults in power take advantage of them and use them for their own gains.

    I really enjoyed Coeur Al'Aran's stuff several years ago. From my experience it helps to have watched the first couple of seasons of RWBY to know the characters, but otherwise you can jump right in.

    TBF, they do start to blend together a bit after you've read four or five of them, despite the very different premises. I like his Blacksmith Jaune series; I'll give this a shot!
    ```

  - u/generalamitt:
    ```
    >Coeur Al'Aran

    I gave up on this guy's fics after it'd become clear that he never does anything interesting with his plots or develops characters that are a bit more complex than the bare shallows.

    His prose is quite good and flows well. He writes fun character interactions and really nails down each character's distinct personality from the RWBY's cast. (which is not surprising after so many years of writing in the same fandom.)

    The thing that gets me about this guy though, is that his stories always fail to deliver on any interesting promises and sort of peter out without reaching a climax or a great twist. Despite the interesting beginnings, it seems like he doesn't know where to take his stories and they never recover from the "dreaded middle" story block.
    ```

    - u/Revlar:
      ```
      You're not wrong, but the other problem is the repetition. Initially I was noticing it between stories, for example every single story has the phrase "quantity has a quality of its own". Nowadays he'll repeat himself in the same story very frequently, like Jaune in this Raise one, who "figured out why famous people marry other famous people so commonly" almost every chapter, a phrase that gets repeated mindlessly over and over despite not even being true irl, drilling it into your head. I get that the author is prolific and makes money off of teaching people how to write like him, but damn. This quantity is lacking in quality.
      ```

      - u/CaramilkThief:
        ```
        Yup that's true. I still like his works though because of the character interaction. His plots are somewhat mid but imo he's good at doing satisfying and dynamic characters. I saw a description once that explained it really well: it's like fanfiction shonen jump. He's very consistent and prolific, and best of all he can actually finish stories  (which is a high bar for fanfiction). But the plot depth and coherence can be lacking sometimes.

  A while back I came across a [Hurry up living or hurry up dying](https://www.alternatehistory.com/forum/threads/hurry-up-living-or-hurry-up-dying-a-ww2-polish-si-story.467055/), a WW2 Polish SI story that I really liked. Part 1 finished a few months ago, and I haven't seen an update in awhile, and it turns out that that because the author stared [a new thread for part 2](https://www.alternatehistory.com/forum/threads/hurry-up-living-or-hurry-up-dying-volume-two.539733/)

  It's essentially an alt-history military fic, well-written (though there are some grammatical mistakes nothing too bad) and interesting, though the author does like to put the MC through mental self-flagellation and making characters more dramatic. Still, it's a fun read that I'd recommend. Well thought-out plans come together in a very satisfying way,
  ```

- u/Dragfie:
  ```
  I'd like to recommend an obscure, under reviewed fiction which I think rat readers would enjoy:
  https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/56949/immortality-starts-with-generosity
  "Immortality starts with generosity".

  I have a lot to say about this fiction, but I think to start is to address why it's reviwed so badly and I still recommend it: I believe it's because the title is ironic, and if you don't realise that early people who think they'd enjoy it won't.

  Secondly, why I love it but others might not: its one of the few fictions where the MC acts how they actually would(rationally), even to the detriment of the narrative.

  Thirdly, there is a lot of reasoning behind the scenes which isn't much explained. Except at the end.

  Now to get to the summary:
  This is an iselai Xanxia where the MC gets reincarnated into a shitty young master and gets a totally random power. "Give something away and get 100x back. Literally." There are a few restrictions so it's not broken.
  The premise is completely random but is just played straight. Characters reasoning seems very rational to me and the MC isn't a genius but is written as competent and he feels like it.

  There are a bunch of events I really enjoyed in the fiction, and a bunch which just the pure common sense resolutions really felt satisfactory. So, recommending it as an almost  "hidden gem".
  ```

  - u/melmonella:
    ```
    I do not think it is terribly rational, seems like a fairly bog standard xianxia subversion to my eyes.
    ```

    - u/Dragfie:
      ```
      It seems that way at first, and I thought so too, until you get a little into it and realise its actually very deep. Hence the rec since its the sort of story people who would like it would gance over it at first. 

      You can check the other comments about some spoiler discussion on what i realy liked about its rationality.
      ```

      - u/melmonella:
        ```
        I've read until like chapter 80 before forming my opinion.
        ```

  - u/megazver:
    ```
    I've enjoyed it for a while, been reading it since the first few chapters. The slow-burn arranged-marriage-to-actual-feelings romance was fun. 

    Then the author seemingly decided he didn't actually want to write that, swerved hard and ran the story into the ground. Blew up the whole story first, then almost killed it off with the interminable cavern sequence.

    He then started off a second story arc about the MC travelling with a buddy and while it was sometimes fun on the scene level, I spent like 20 chapters waiting to see if he'd do some kind of an inciting incident or something and show us what this arc is going to *about* and it just... never started.

    I gave up on it eventually. It's a shame.
    ```

    - u/Dragfie:
      ```
      Haha, so this is exactly what I ment by my second point, and I personally actually LOVED that. 

      The outcome of the first arc (first companion going her own way) is actually exactly what made me really love this story.   
      See, in EVERY story, when you have a setup like that: "Guy gets together with reluctant woman, and she eventually finds out he isn't that bad" the outcome is ALWAYS "She gets in his pants." 

      But in reality that isn't what always (or even usually) happens. Sometimes the other half does end up liking their forced-parter, but not sexually. And in that case, well they are still friends but no more.   
      Narratively this is very unpopular, because it makes guys feel insecure. Cos of course, how could a girl not want to fuck you if she knows how nice a guy you really are? But the resolution to this ark was just so REAL. and so respectful to... Well women I guess. IDK I haven't ever recommended a work on its progressiveness, but this one plot resolution just really scratched that realism itch I was missing in all the stories I've read so far. 

      I agree the caverns arc was sorta meh but thats just because I personally hate "complete the dungeon" arcs. I enjoy dialogue between characters not "numbers go up" so thats a personal prefference. 

      Either way that ends fairly soon, and idk what you mean about it not going anywhere, they do plenty of things and the stakes go up and down a lot but I suspect thats just the slow plot progression weekness of webserials issue rather than a narrative one.
      ```

        I do understand that this was what he tried to go for. I just think it didn't work and I don't feel like pretending it did on the basis of "Oh but wouldn't it be very progressive? Just imagine, setting up a romance story then swerving into 'Oh, but romance is DUMB and PROBLEMATIC, actually' at the climax?"
        ```

        - u/Dragfie:
          ```
          Sure, you can't help what you like, and that's why I mentioned that it's realism is to the detriment of the narrative, but I'd totally disagree with the dumb and problematic description. In fact, I'd say this resolution was the best rationally possible IRL with no drama at all. A "sorry I'm just not interested" met with disappointment and then just an "alright". No insults, no trying to get the girl, just what you actually morraly should do in that situation.

          I can't speak for the author but to me this looks more like: "let's get a ambitious but not interested in a relationship woman and an ACTUALLY nice guy (not just nice^tm) get them to be forced to marry through circumstances and then write what would ACTIALLY happen."

          What happend in the story is what would actually happen in such a situation. No drama, no idiocy, no "getting the girl" bs, just people being understanding.

          And as I said, may feel unsatisfactory to many people, but I'm recommending it here because I suspect a few people here would enjoy the realism over the romantic trope like I did 😜

            I didn't mind all the way the story handled the forced marriage, it's just that immediately after that arc came the cave and that whole segment was just boring - the point of the story was about relationships after all, and Phelps was literally just a furry lump.
            ```

            - u/Dragfie:
              ```
              Yeah completely agree caverns ark was kinda boring. I skipped through it actually, but it wasn't too long and returned to the interactions pretty fast after that. 

              Phelps has quite a bit of character development over time though.
              ```

  - u/gfe98:
    ```
    I disliked the first arc with Lan Fen, the MC's dependence on her felt rather nauseating to me. After he parted ways with her I liked the story a lot though.
    ```

    - u/Dragfie:
      ```
      Thats an interesting perspective XD I didn't feel he was too reliant but can't remember it that clearly now so maybe.
      ```

  - u/Lyslum:
    ```
    I didn't realize it was reviewed badly, I quite like how constrained the power is and the world building is  nice. I can see how some people might dislike it since the MC doesn't behave like most isekai drones would.
    ```

    - u/Dragfie:
      ```
      Yeah and since it's qualities are really impossible to tell from first glance wanted to recommend it here.
      ```

  - u/Nick_named_Nick:
    ```
    I bounced pretty hard off of this after the first ~25 chapters. Might have to skim until Lan Fen departs based on other comments here. Thanks for the rec!
