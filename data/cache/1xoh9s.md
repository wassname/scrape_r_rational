  Rather hastily done, but I couldn't resist. Inspired by [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/1xgq7r/q_has_anyone_written_narrative_fiction_of_the_ai/) and [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/1xj8v5/quick_q_is_it_important_to_read_the_omakes_in_ch/). Let me know how you think it can be improved.

    A number of times you use Lothlorien where I suspect you meant Rivendell =).

      Ugh, you're right. Haven't read the books in so long...I'm sure I deviated from canon in a number of small ways that would drive Lotr fans crazy.

        Meh, by the time Sauron is not just competent but *a hypercompetent Power* there's not much to salvage.  The whole setting - let alone story - only makes sense in the tradition of heroic epics and mythology, which is what Tolkien was writing.  In a more modern 'serious fantasy' tradition, it just wouldn't work under the weight of the cliches (many of which it codified, yes).

    Maybe it's because I'm not a native speaker, but I found part about winning Elrond confusing. 

    What exactly Frodo's words should accomplish? What *"now ~~Lothlorien~~ Rivendell was not seen as already lost but had to be decided to sacrifice"* even means? Also, wouldn't someone find this abrupt change of topic (from unreliability of source to the fate of Rivendell) suspicious?

    - u/None:
      ```
      No, it's just badly worded. I'll fix that....
      ```

        By the way, that's what I would do, were I Frodo. 

        Apparently, Elrond doesn't like to think about painful things, prone to procrastination and takes pleasure in an escapism. Also, elven rings are mostly free from Sauron's influence, and are responsible for preservation of Elven lands in their current half-utopian state.

        Something like that probably will do:

        "You don't have to rely on my words only. Use Vilya to tell whether I am lying, or something â€” I dont' know about what Vilya can or cannot do, but I sure we are able to invent some way to check my words and shield the wearer of Vilya from the influence of One. We should think about it later, maybe next month, because firstly we should attend to much more urgent matters. The defense of Gondor is important, whether I am lying or not."

        What about long-term? I should, now and again, hint at beautiful future that is to come, provided Sauron is defeated, leaving Three Elven rings intact and free. That will bite off Elrond's attention; if done right, elf will spend more and more time daydreaming, letting his guard down.
        ```

          ```
          Wow, I forgot Vilya even existed. Elrond doesn't seem to do much, does he? Galadriel makes a much stronger impression.
          ```

  ```
  This is, most indeed, at VERY good read! Recommendable!
  ```

- u/BT_Uytya:
  ```
  ...and now I am fairly confident that having Ring stolen by Isildur was Sauron's plan all along.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Actually, my original plan was for Frodo to deduce the ring was created by aliens. No lie.
    ```

- u/Pluvialis:
  ```
  I'm glad you had a crack at writing this!
  ```

- u/Liberticus:
  ```
  I really enjoyed this. Will you continue writing the story?
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    I thought a scene where Frodo has to confront a ringed Galadriel could be cool, though I don't really know what the point would be.
    ```

  Thanks everyone for the kind words and many upvotes.

    This was great, thanks for writing it. 

    A few comments: If the Ring makes its wearer practically omniscient and unbeatable like Frodo in this story then why did all the previous wearers lost it at some point? This should be explained somehow. Frodo isn't very extraordinary and Sauron seems to be better at instrumental rationality so if the Ring really is *that* good then Sauron shouldn't have been able to lost it in the first place. Is it because the Ring still can't control everything and some things are just up to chance, or the Ring has predestined everything and Frodo just happened to be the best candidate to wear it for a long period of time, or the Ring is lying even to Frodo in this story, the Ring is nothing like it told to Frodo and the ring-wearing immortality is not a foregone conclusion?
    ```
