## Coming of age stories

### Post:

I have read many rationalist stories, but I'd like to find a deep story about the *learning* of rationality. 

Many stories make the main character teach other people about rationalist concepts, but I haven't yet found any about the main character learning how to be rational from zero, or almost zero. A rationalist coming of age story.

Do anyone know a story like this? How would anyone write it? In my mind, it would look like a rationalist version of Taran Wanderer, but is this the best format?

  I loved the Prydain books as a kid!

  Hmm... unfortunately, thats a bit of a rare combo. Motherof learning is probably the best existing work like that off the top of my head.

  Not rational, but I'm a fan of the manga Omani Master Kurosawa (NSFW, but basically starts off as a parody of Death Note. Somehow turns into a coming of age story, and makes it work!) and Molester Man.

  If it's all right to plug my own work, I've been writing a fanfic called [The Incompetent Witcher](http://archiveofourown.org/works/7742563/chapters/17651086) taking place in the universe of the Witcher books/games (think medieval Europe with a mix of Eastern European folklore). The young protagonist is supposed to be intelligent but headstrong, naive, and therefore quite insensible -- but he will become progressively more rational (and, unfortunately, more cynical) as he learns the ways of the world.

  This is the story of my life. Problem is, when I first started learning rationality I had some EXTREMELY embarrassing moments in the valley of bad rationality, many of which are not worth sharing because they involve miscommunications which would paint me in a rather inaccurate negative light, and I wasn't coherent enough to really be accomplishing anything, and I was already so psychologically messed up and maladjusted from before that that I wasn't really all that likable at the time either. It wasn't until I finally left the valley of bad rationality that I gradually started becoming more coherent and less ridiculous, and even now I still struggle at times.

  The one thing I can say is that, somehow, around the time I was first learning rationality techniques, I used them to assist in solving a crime which a private investigator was having trouble with, despite my not having any experience in detective work. I swear this was a lot less interesting than it sounds.

  I think that might have actually been shortly before I had a happy death spiral about rationality, actually.
