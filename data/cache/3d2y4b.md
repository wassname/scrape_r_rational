## So, you know that AGI thing? Turn's out he wasn't crazy. Here's the program:

### Post:

[removed]

### Comments:

- u/SirReality:
  ```
  I believe you meant to include context, a relevant link, and/or a more enlightening comment below. Can't really say much about your post otherwise.
  ```

- u/Esparno:
  ```
  First AGI keeps "modifying his post" which was nothing but [removed].

  Now this.

  I think we are being trolled people.
  ```
