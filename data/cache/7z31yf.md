    Yeah. The only remaining hope is that Thief or Robber managed to do something in the meantime that would allow him to Destroy the bindings. 

    Still, for all the comfort quotes from the future allow us, they only speak of Cat and not of her predecessors. That's no cliffhanger here, that's a chapter-long drop that is cut off inches before the ground.
    ```

    Took the words out of my mouth. Damn.
    ```

- u/Nihilvin:
  ```
  You know what? I want the author to go the whole way with this twist. Make book 4 Diabolist and Cat vs the world.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    the plot twist is that there are not plot twist  and diabolist wins in the end ? interesting take.
    ```

  - u/WalterTFD:
    ```
    I mean, I don't see that as entirely impossible.

    Like, Procer has a lot of narrative weight.  We are gonna fight them.

    But Cat herself muses that while she can go anywhere she wants through Arcadia the fight will be a walkover.  There is no way Evil vs. Good comes down to teleportation and burning Good's homeland.  So Cat has to lose that fey power before the fight with Procer.

    I feel like, in order to escape Diabolist, Cat has to lose or massively curtail her Fey nature, thus becoming a human and not BIND-able.  Maybe Black can accomplish that, but it might take Malicia.
    ```

    - u/Croktopus:
      ```
      Black uses Destroy (or Cat uses it after Taking it from him) to destroy the mantle of winter.
      ```

- u/Hoactzins:
  ```
  Hot damn, 3/4 of a book of Cat having a massive power boost has just paid off for Diabolist. 

  I like how for all of her plots, Diabolist's backup plan was simply to wait for Cat to use Break and then Claim her freely. Simple but effective. 

  Plus I guess all of her talk of Cat's morality and the like helped her in Creation's eyes. Slowly attacking Cat at her foundations is probably the shit that the Gods eat up.
  ```

  - u/Nihilvin:
    ```
    Cat lost the moment she used her third aspect at the start. Fights between Named are all about the aspects and she used her biggest one right off the bat.
    ```

    - u/ForgottenToupee:
      ```
      Has she used Take yet? I thought she didn’t have access to it because of the bindings
      ```

      - u/Nihilvin:
        ```
        She never used Take in the fight
        ```

    - u/Flamesmcgee:
      ```
      She's used Break, only. She has Break, Take and winter powers. Take hasn't been seen yet.
      ```

      - u/RiOrius:
        ```
        Fall is her third (and seemingly most powerful) aspect. He's not saying she used all three.
        ```

        - u/melmonella:
          ```
          I'd say Take is more powerful. Fall is a powerboost, but it's a pretty straight powerboost. If opponent had an idea for how to deal with Cat's winter powers Fall doesn't really bring anything qualitatively different to the table-it's just same winter powers, but *more* of them. Take, on the other hand, gives Cat a new power (great) while permanently taking a power away from the enemy (double great) and thus qualitatively changing the structure of the fight. It's effectively two aspects in one in terms of power.
          ```

  - u/TideofKhatanga:
    ```
    >I guess all of her talk of Cat's morality and the like helped her in Creation's eyes

    People have been dropping anvils on her this entire book and Catherine still hasn't caught on with the fact that she can't half-ass being evil. I guess that *this* will open her eyes.
    ```

- u/paradoxinclination:
  ```
  I think the question that needs to be asked is; how is Black going to break the shape of the narrative Akua is writing here? It would rob too much weight from Catherine's own story for Black to kill Akua himself, and pretty clearly he isn't going to kill Cat. But he's also not really the kind of mentor who'd let his apprentice strike him down in some act of self sacrifice.

  I think... Black might need to find some way to have Akua kill him with her own hands. That moment of high emotion could lead to Cat breaking free of Akua's grasp and transitioning, or transitioning and gaining an Aspect that then allows her to escape. It sidesteps the issue of the Calamites, and subverts the usual cliché of the villain being killed by their own intended replacement.
  ```

    > I think the question that needs to be asked is; how is Black going to break the shape of the narrative Akua is writing here? 

    I feel like the narrative is already on Cat's side. Akua even explained why - Squire is half Good and half Bad. It's true that in a villainous Role Cat would be boned right now but is she a Villain at the moment? She's fighting against her nemesis in their evil lair, her mentor captured and her army and all of her Kingdom at risk. It's even shown in the dialogue: Akua is doing the evil monologuing and Cat is talking about love. 

    The whole thing stinks of a Hero's most desperate moment before divine intervention or some such.
    ```

    - u/leakycauldron:
      ```
      Villains don't get divine interventions though. Just Robber.
      ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      This, Everyboy is especting for cat to become black queen or something in the vain, I think Black biggest insult to the heave is to steal one of their own, she is going to make cat a hero, but not one that will follow the gods above whims.
      ```

- u/sparkc:
  ```
  Correct me if I’m wrong but it feels like Masego would have warned Catherine of this outcome had he known she intended to use Arcadia as a battlefield? It didn’t feel like a Diabolist being suited to Arcadia was intended to be some particularly big secret. 

  I do hope the answer is not that Catherine didn’t run her plan by Masego because if you’re preparing to fight a Named mage he would be one of the first people you would run your plans by.

  baited and outsmarted
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    *footage of a chessboard*
    ```

- u/ForgottenToupee:
  ```
  Oh look, it’s the thing that’s been foreshadowed since Book One
  ```

  - u/Flamesmcgee:
    ```
    What are we talking about here, specifically?
    ```

    - u/Oaden:
      ```
      Villain vs Villain that likes to think of herself as acting for the greater good
      ```

- u/Zayits:
  ```
  I just realized we missed another opportunity for Cat to break out: Black hasn't used Destroy yet. As I understand it, it's a power that is meant specifically to suppress other people's Aspects, so he can either bait Akua into whatever its range is (I would guess that it's touch-based, but I thought the same about Take, and then Battle of Four Armies and One happened) or, in case they have to sacrifice something and catch Akua off guard, have Catherine Take it.
  ```

  [The discussion in /r/PracticalGuideToEvil has gone very differently.](https://www.reddit.com/r/PracticalGuideToEvil/comments/7z3207/chapter_67_middle_eight/)

  There's been people pointing out that the 'middle eight', in our list of musically themed chapter titles, is the midpoint where things change. It's the breakdown, the bridge, the point where the music goes to a different space for a while in order to create contrast when the familiar section kicks back in. 

  And others stating that Akua vs. Cat looks like a straight up Villian vs. Hero fight at this point, with Cat as the hero... and there's no way that narrative ends with Akua winning. 

  I see this as how the 'apprentice kills the master' trope associated with the Black Knight happens. Black treated Cat so well that it would never happen normally, therefore we get mind control bullshit. And that in turn would cause Cat to transition into a new name. Akua already mentioned that a Black Knight with the power of the last of Winter would be significantly harder to deal with.
  ```

- u/WalterTFD:
  ```
  Ruh Roh.  This is a serious problem.
  ```

- u/RynnisOne:
  ```
  This one seemed rather rushed compared to the previous.

  There wasn't much complexity in the fighting and it was fairly straightforward.

  If it wasn't for that "Rule of Three" stuff supposedly no longer applying, I'd say Cat was just trying to get this portion over quickly as a 'loss' so she could get to the third and final conflict faster.
  ```

- u/Empiricist_or_not:
  ```
  Anyone looked at the general definitions of middle 8, the part of the song on the middle that contrasts the theme and repeated choruses that come before and after, to temper thier speculation?
