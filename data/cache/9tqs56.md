  There's a sequence around the midpoint of  [Worm](https://parahumans.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/) that I think fits that description but I'm not sure how to say more without spoilers. 

  In a more general sense though I'm not sure what "crazy advantage" implies. In general, the best way to believably beat a precog IS having a significant advantage, either in planning the engagement or combat power, otherwise the precog "ought" to win every time.

    Another instance of that happens at the end of Worm.

    >!Scion also has the Path to Victory power, he used his to find a future where he sees his partner again, but when he gets there, he only finds the dead flesh garden left behind by Cauldron.!<

    Also, this hasn't been confirmed by the author, but it makes sense: >!The defeat of Scion. I am fairly certain Scion could have used his power to escape the mental torment, and in fact, tried to do so. He asked his Path to Victory power for a way to stop the pain. His power extrapolated Scion's mental development, and concluded he would never move on from Eden. So it looked for alternate ways to stop him hurting, and arrived at one simple answer: "Hold still" !<

    I just found [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Parahumans/comments/5zfdns/worm_showerthoughts/dexweow/) on how the scene you're talking about played out from the POV of the precog. It's fucking horrifying:

    >!That final Coil scene, when he is held down at gunpoint while the Undersiders have a nice long chat about the moral implications of murder and what it means to be a villain?!<

    >!He tried to escape a hundred times. He grabbed for the gun and got shot. He jumped and got shot. He tried to talk, bluff his way out, and Tattletale told Taylor to shoot him. He crawled and got shot. He ran and got shot. He tried to twist so the bullet only hit his shoulder, but the second bullet got his head. He ran and got shot. He reached for the gun and got shot. He reached for the gun and got shot. He reached for the gun and got shot. One time he managed to disarm Tay Tay and got killed by Grue. He ran the other way and got shot.!<

    >!Every second he tried something new, he got killed, and he split the timeline again, to try the impossible. Until the bitter end. And nobody knew, not even Tattletale stopped to think about it.!<

        ```
        >!Taylor had a deadman's switch with info about him set up, and she was only going to disarm it after he let her talk to Lisa. That's why he gave up his safe timeline and committed to being there; so he could have one timeline where he didn't let them talk, and another where he allowed it. We don't know what happened in the timeline where he didn't bring Lisa, but I assume details on everything he did and owns was broadcast across the entire US.!<

        ```

- u/AntiChri5:
  ```
  There is a pretty interesting contrast in how this was handled in *Worm* and *A Practical Guide to Evil*.

  In Worm, they had very reliable information about the ways their opponents power worked. >!Coil used his power to predict the short term outcomes of choices and choose the most beneficial of two options. It allowed him to always know whether to attack or bide his time, when his enemies would attack, ect. So they lay the groundwork very very slowly and very very patiently, working against him in countless subtle ways aimed at depleting or subverting his resources so that by the time the confrontation came his ability wouldn't be relevant as he lacked the resources to act on the information it gave him.!<

  In *A Practical Guide to Evil*, the situation is the opposite. They know very little about their opponent, only that they are called "The Skein of Fate" and that they can "read stories". >!In order to win against someone who gets to skip as far ahead in the book as he likes before deciding what to do, we got the kind of overly aggressive self mutilating insanity that is the hallmark of plans made by Catherine Foundling.!<

  >!A series of conditional orders was prepared. If Y has happened then open X kind of thing. Some written down, others stored as sealed memories. Then she had the parties *memories erased* so that people wouldn't be able to predict their own actions. As conditions were met, orders would be acted upon or memories regained. Then the party separated, so that they would be acting independently and less able to influence each other. The goal was to create as much chaos and as many unpredictable elements as possible. When your opponent knows whatever you plan, throw so many plans at him that he can't keep track. Just overwhelm him with bullshit, set everything on fire and bullrush through.!<
  ```

  - u/Morghus:
    ```
    When I read that they had a precog I groaned, because rarely do they do that in a believable way. PGtE handled that so well. We got just enough information to get a minor handle on what was happening, and just enough to get a feel for how the characters were feeling. Complete and utter confusion!
    ```

  - u/DTravers:
    ```
    Luminosity - the rational Twilight fic - had an antagonist deliberately not decide whether or not to carry out their plan until the last second so the seer didn't have a definite future.

    - u/Menolith:
      ```
      That's another pretty good example. The Augur can only foresee events >!which are premeditated, so Black does educated guesses where people with swords might come in handy and gives them orders to seize opportunities as they come by.!<

  Mistborn spoilers: >!One way to defeat precognition is to react to the way the precog is reacting to the future faster than they can react to you reacting to them. Essentially, if you're good enough at reading people, you can use *them* as a window into the future and react accordingly.!<
  ```

  - u/Watchful1:
    ```
    I always hated the mistborn pregoc. Any half decent sword fighter reacts to their opponents movements faster than a few seconds. It's one thing to dodge arrows or something, but unless the power is somehow fixing the future in place, there's no way a person's actions are fixed 3 seconds from now is basically any fight.
    ```

    - u/AuthorBrianBlose:
      ```
      As someone who trains MMA (with a crew of guys who fight amateur), having even a half-second glimpse into the future movements of an opponent would be a *monumental* advantage.  You would know what was a feint and what was a real attack, you would know the angles, you wouldn't be surprised by a trick move, or need to worry about not being quick enough to spot something incoming.

      People who fight aren't deciding on their actions at the last moment.  There is a lot of thinking happening.  You notice someone drops their lead hand after a jab, so you leave a hole in your guard to bait the jab, then slip and hit them with a hard right.  That's all premeditated.  When you get good, you no longer consciously have to process a lot of things, but you're still thinking and making decisions, you just delegate that thinking to lower levels of your mind.

      In Mistborn, the precognition is powerful for combat applications.  I think three seconds is more than adequate in a fight between skilled opponents.  If there is anything about the scenarios that stretched my suspension of disbelief, it was the way Vin overcame it by not making any decision at all until her opponent was committed to his action.  I think the consequence of her strategy should more realistically have been a dead Vin.
      ```

      - u/signspace13:
        ```
        I don't know if that's how I would describe Vin's action, what she does is let her reflexes make an attack without really considering it, thus giving her openent a snapshot of the future in which she makes that attack, but she is also watching for the move he makes in retaliation, using him to read the future, when she see it she changes her action, making two possible futures occur at the same time.

        It's worth mentioning that atium is almost like a drug, it makes you feel godly and all powerful (which makes sense as it is technically part of a god), so it leads it's using to overcommit and make mistakes in ways they normally wouldn't simply due to the absolute certainty that their action is correct.

        Vin won the fight through playing on this and through no small amount of luck as well.
        ```

        - u/AuthorBrianBlose:
          ```
          Given what we know about Atium, human reaction time isn't fast enough for Vin's ploy to ever work.  The average human reaction time to visual stimulus is 0.25 seconds.  That isn't enough of a time window against an experienced opponent.  And if it is enough for some reason . . . well, then this should be a well-known hack for fighting someone burning Atium.  It seems to be an example of the "Rule of Cool" being prioritized over the consistency of a magic system.
          ```

          - u/signspace13:
            ```
            I still disagree, she is definitely burning pewter and tin in this scene, both of which would give her a decent boost to her reaction time, not as much of a boost as Atium would, but still a boost, and with her opponents mind overwhelmed with the cognitive dissonance of the impossibility she had just enough luck to win.

            I won't say it was 100% skill or would work every time, just that it makes sense that it would in that exact situation with that specific opponent. Vin comments on the possibility of others knowing the trick by saying it isn't the kind of technique a Mistborn would ever share as it would possibly negate their greatest advantage. From more personal conjecture, Mistborn are basically magical super assassins, anyone trying to spread the knowledge would likely find a obsidian knife in their throat.
            ```

      - u/tjhance:
        ```
        Never read mistborn, but I think I could get behind that strategy if it came as the result of preparation and months of practicing this odd style of fighting (and relying on the fact that the precog relies on their powers too much and isn't a good fighter otherwise). Maybe it still wouldn't be realistic at all, but I would be able to suspend my disbelief as a reader.
        ```

        - u/the_terran:
          ```
          Unfortunately it kinda comes out of the blue. >!She figures out and implements it during the "boss fight". In her defense, there was no way to test it before given the lack of precognition granting atium.!<
          ```

          - u/tjhance:
            ```
            ah well, I still think it could potentially be done in an interesting way! If I were doing it, I would have a bunch of philosophy about humans' inability to generate unbiased random numbers and training methods to overcome that...

            also, I think there was something similar in the >!Fairy Tail anime (which is crap btw).!< It was a similar thing, the character decides to start making 'random moves' (or 'unplanned moves' or something) on the spot and it just works.
            ```

      - u/Watchful1:
        ```
        I totally agree that having a half second look into the future would be invaluable. I'm saying a 3 second look is far less valuable because people react far faster than that to outside information.

      The idea behind that is '[determinism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinism)' (the future *is* fixed in place) + it can be predicted. The interesting part is just how high the energy costs were.

- u/RiOrius:
  ```
  I forget where I read it, but there was an off-hand comment in some story (or possibly comments section) about using a slow-acting poison/disease against someone with limited precognition.  If they can see 24 hours into the future and you can slip them something untreatable that won't show symptoms until two days later, that's checkmate.
  ```

  - u/ArgentStonecutter:
    ```
    [If you can see 24 hours into the future you can see indefinitely into the future, for important enough things.](http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/06/02/and-i-show-you-how-deep-the-rabbit-hole-goes/)

    tl;dr - Once or twice a day you write down the most important predictions you have, then look at the note that future-self left for you less than 24 hours ahead.

    Even if you don't think of that trick, for a poison that takes 48 hours to take effect, you'll start acting differently 24 hours before it takes effect because you'll suddenly know about it, and 24 hours before than you'll notice your reactions to the information, and so on.

  I can think of two instances of this in [Worth the Candle](https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/25740126). These summaries should be fairly spoiler free:

  1.	Revision mages can revise actions after the fact — basically a painful form of precognition. The solution isn’t very interesting or long, though. [Chapter 33, two thirds of the way down the page.](https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/27276423)
  2.	Unicorns are not your friends. Unfortunately, they are precogs. [Chapter 40.](https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/27684774)
  ```

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    Basically, the unicorn solution is "more dakka". Do not find a path that leads to success; instead, ensure that all paths lead to success.

    They didn't exactly out think the revision mage, just used a magic weapon that he couldn't revise.
    ```

- u/Roneitis:
  ```
  Although not explicitly rational, Frank Herbert's Dune saga has some of the best handling of precognition I've ever encountered, and the second book in particular does a great job of showing a prescient character's downfall, though it's only partially a result of another agent's plotting.

- u/Argenteus_CG:
  ```
  Well, assuming the precog's reflexes aren't similarly enhanced, a straight fight is likely an option. Don't have to do something they can't predict, just do things so quickly that their reflexes can't keep up. Not exactly "outwitting them", though.

  This also depends on the exact nature of their powers. If they see from their own perspective, then a sneak attack might work. They'd see their vision go dark ahead of time, but not know where the attack came from. And if you used something where they can't escape in time with however far ahead their precognition is, say, a bomb, you could guarantee their death.

  On the opposite end of the scale, if they're omniscient and are intelligent enough to handle all of that information, you're pretty much fucked.
  ```

  - u/Menolith:
    ```
    > a straight fight is likely an option

    The problem is persuading the precog into that fight in the first place since they presumably know that they're not walking away from it.

  It depends on what seeing across "space or time" even means. Like - can they see their immediate future? How far ahead can they see their future, if so? How does that gel with their actions taken as a result of their seeing the future changing the future that they would see?  If they can see and comprehend and understand every molecule in the entire universe simultaneously throughout all of space and time from now until the eventual heat-death of the universe as the last particles eventually decay into nothing, and also all the possible different futures that could arise from every permutation of their own actions simultaneously, then pretty much every approach one might consider is doomed. The difference between that godlike omniscience and complete apprehension of every future, and the sort of cognition that could plausibly fit inside a single human mind - in short, their limitations - is going to define how you approach this problem.

  For example, if the person in question can 'see' exactly but not more than 24 hours into their own future from their own perspective and they couldn't do a [Black Pill Infinite Future Info Relay thing](http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/06/02/and-i-show-you-how-deep-the-rabbit-hole-goes/), then an attack that would reliably effect them 25+ hours from the attack becoming unstoppable would be an approach that might have merit. If they're doing a Coil-style A/B testing of the future out to infinite time but with limited practical branching points, you have to take a totally different approach.

  The second part is what you want in terms of 'defeating' them - do you need them dead? imprisoned and ineffective? merely set back  in some way on some goal of theirs? If your terminal value is 'stop their scheme to take over the world', then that's different than if your terminal value is 'have this person actually die'. It also matters if your values in this scenario include any other goals such as your own survival or well-being.

  It's a while since I read it, but in Mistborn, Atium let's you see a short distance into the future of what your opponent will do.

  [http://mistborn.wikia.com/wiki/Atium](http://mistborn.wikia.com/wiki/Atium)

  If two people burn atium, then both see a sea of possibilities as both their actions change as the other might respond to the changes so it effectively cancels out. 

  In the book the heroine doesn't plan her moves, but reacts to where her Atium burning opponent is attacking based on seeing she *will* *be* thereby making her actions a function of his actions which nullifies his predictions of her actions. 

  It's clever, and I don't have the passage to hand, but I seem to remember it feeling believable when I read it.

    >She snapped her eyes open. He had the dagger raised; it glittered as it swung. Vin prepared to attack, but didn’t think about the strike; she simply let her body react.
    And she watched Zane very, very carefully.

    >He flinched just slightly to the left, open hand moving upward, as if to grab something.

    >There! Vin thought, immediately wrenching herself to the side, forcing her instinctive attack out of its natural trajectory. She twisted her arm—and dagger—midswing. She had been about to attack left, as Zane’s atium had anticipated.

    >But, by reacting, Zane had shown her what she was going to do. Let her see the future. And if she could see it, she could change it.

    >They met. Zane’s weapon took her in the shoulder. But Vin’s knife took him in the neck. His left hand closed on empty air, snatching at a shadow that should have told him where her arm would be.

  The classic science fiction short story *Minority Report* involves this as a major plot element. It's also in the movie but I think the short story, while maybe not being rational in and of itself, would be nevertheless interesting  to the sort of people who hang out on /r/rational as the ending is really neat (and naturally different to the movie's ending).

  ```
  I once wrote a fanfic that included a section where the Evil Leaper (from *Quantum Leap*) Leaped into one of the villains - with no sign of Samuel Beckett to counteract her. So, the villain had the advantage of access to news reports and official records of the future (which could only change as a result of her own actions), while the heroes had no future knowledge at all. The heroes were, however, familiar with her capabilities (due to a previous encounter with Dr. Beckett).

  So the heroes put in place no less than four separate plans to stop her plans, in different corners of the city. (Fortunately, revealing certain information was enough). Any one of them would easily work if she didn't stop it, and all four were ready to go on the same evening... then they kept an eye on *her* location, running with whichever plan was *furthest* from her. The result was that, simply by moving across the city, she stopped whichever plan she was headed towards and triggered a different one in a different part of the city instead... and, future knowledge or not, she couldn't be in four places at once.
