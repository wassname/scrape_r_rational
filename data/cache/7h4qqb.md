      Can confirm. I [called](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/72iul3/rtwip_worth_the_candle_chapter_40_in_which_the/dnj3brm/) Essentialism being programming, and u/nytelios [expected](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/72iul3/rtwip_worth_the_candle_chapter_40_in_which_the/dnjc62l/?context=10000) it to be soul magic. Granted, it turned out we were *both* correct, which at least I didn't expect, while u/FudgeOff independently (?) [made](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7fx0so/rtwip_worth_the_candle_ch_62_drift/dqf4oo7/) a completely correct guess, but thon did it only last chapter, while our discussion took place several months ago.

      ... Yes, we'll take those Bayes points, thank you, thank you.

    I'm sure it's incidental touch. But Juniper will likely quickly get proficient enough to detect any changes, if not able to prevent them.

    And we already know it's not mind control. He couldn't touch you and just instantly make you do what he wants.
    ```

- u/None:
  ```
  I'm getting a hostile AI vibe from the elf guy, in the sense that he's a foe that the party will assuredly lose to if they engage with him for long enough.

  He appears to have (maybe literally?) dialed his Insight up to like a hundred, and seemingly keeps pulling way too much info out of Juniper's tiny misstatements: several times in the last few chapters he's caught a slip up, queried Jun about it, then watched for a reaction while letting the massive Insight-Poise mismatch do some major body language/mind reading work. (e.g. the "residual" statment/Matrix implication cluing him in that Jun is dream-skewered, thus revealing a weakness that can be uniquely targeted by via soul magic?) I just get the feeling that he's mining a ton of info from the smallest of clues and using it to build a way too accurate model of Jun's situation.

  All we really know about the guy is that his goal - above escaping the prison/personal freedom, his centuries-long experimentation, or even his immediate personal safety - is to gather information on Juniper. Which makes me think that his curiosity on the subject may go hand in hand with him being able achieve all of the aforementioned, in addition to in him being able to beat the party in a fight. (And given his supremely twisted set of morals betrayal seems kind of inevitable...I know Jun isn't your standard lawful good protagonist, but I can't see him unleashing this psycho on the world to go around casually reprogramming people's minds. And the elf guy almost assuredly knows that Mary was lying through her teeth about him ever getting a pardon/freedom to use soul magic, so now everyone involved knows that one side is ultimately going to end up dead/enthralled.)

  If so, then maybe the elf guy's win condition revolves around gathering enough info on Jun's condition to customize a method of attack that is inherently "unblockable" due to the party's unfamiliarity with soul magic, or perhaps Jun's particular weakness to it. (If he's already grasped the entirety of the situation then I could easily see his goal being as basic as rewriting Jun to have access to the superweapon on par with King Arthur.) And Jun wins by ferreting out enough soul magic training to be able to ditch his almost certainly more intelligent tutor (since being hundreds of years old should translate directly to a high Knowledge stat?). This doesn't really bode well. 

  It's like the soul mage is tailor made as an enemy to counter Juniper: the party is forced to treat with him rather than just kill him, they're playing an infosec game governed by social stats ("dump" stats...), and there's inherent time pressure that forces Jun to engage in such a losing game in the first place.

  Even the null counter demon puppet person seems like a challenge deliberately concocted by the DM, with this one subverting the whole "companions are safe" expectation. Like a stage magician the elf guy kept burning potential trap card after trap card, forcing the party to worry about threats like numbers disparity and soul-link mechanics, while quietly sliding the null into the group without much of a fuss. (Apparently she's such a nonthreat she can be countered with a "punch to the mouth"? Really guy?) It could be argued that he left her behind with his rage mutants to die, but assuming he's an enemy that's cleverer than the party he could have by that point modeled Jun accurately enough to have predicted his penchant for "heroism"/avoiding the cowardice debuff.

  It could be I'm making the guy out too be way more hyper competent than he actually is, but like I said he just comes across as a threat they'd never have gotten close to if it weren't for their current desperation. Which kind of puts the ball firmly in the bad guy's court here.
  ```

  - u/serge_cell:
    ```
    It could be but it's too cliche. It could be much more interseting if Fallatehr actually have strong moral or at least non-socipathic/non-egotistic goals, but his goals/moral code don't fit into contemporary society. Analog could be early-modern surgeons digging up corpses and doing dissection on them, action abhorrent and immoral for their contemporaries. The moral problems of Soul Magic are not dissimilar to problems of invasive brain-computer interface reserach, wich is forbidden for healthy patients in most of (or all) western countries. This total ban could be seen as barbaric from some point in the future.
    ```

  - u/SoylentRox:
    ```
    A well written post.  My only comment is that the game clearly doesn't want to kill Jun.  Which fits with your hypothesis well, since a loss to this boss would be being stuck as a puppet with a quest to get free.

  Hey /u/cthulhuraejepsen, I'm really enjoying this story. It's better written than it has any right to be. 

  Do you mind if I ask you why you're writing it? Apologies if you've already answered this in a previous thread.
  ```

  - u/cthulhuraejepsen:
    ```
    > Do you mind if I ask you why you're writing it?

    That's a weird question. Not *bad* weird, but ... there's a set of all the stories that I want to write, and out of that set, which is *enormous*, I've chosen this one, and I don't know that I can boil the "why" down to something sensible.

    I guess when I decide to write a story, I have three big criteria:

    1. I like to write the sorts of stories that I like to read, because after a few years I'll have forgotten enough of the details that I can come in somewhat fresh to it and have the incredible experience of reading something written *exactly* to my tastes.
    2. I like to write things that are fun to write. What makes a story fun to write varies, but worldbuilding is a big part of it, and little flashes of insight when I've figured something out are another.
    3. Given the above, I would much rather go for something that's in low supply, particularly if it's something that I have high demand for (i.e. works that fill holes specific to me).

    So this story has a lot of things in it that I haven't seen done in other places, and the high-school-friend-group thing is modeled (almost unethically) closely on actual people, which gives associated therapy/catharsis/nostalgia for me.

    But I'm not sure that answers the question, because there are *other* stories that I could have written that would have filled those same needs and wants for me, and the next thing that I write will have those same three criteria as above, but I don't think that I will be able to say "I needed to write *Worth the Candle* before this other thing". I'll hopefully be a better writer by the end of this, and hopefully have changed somewhat in the process of spending hundreds of hours writing and thinking, but I don't think it's a prerequisite for those other things that I'll write, nor do I think that I'm writing this because of an honest sit-down consideration of what was most important (or highest utility) for me to write.
    ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Along the same vein, /u/cthulhuraejepsen, I just wanted to say that from your writing you seem like an awesome person. I really like how you treat social issues without being preachy, the story itself is fantastic and the technical quality is really good. This may not mean anything from a random internet stranger but you seem like a really cool person and you're a great writer :)

- u/mp3max:
  ```
  Oh no! A cliffhanger like that is just pure cruelty! Curse you /u/cthulhuraejepsen !

  Good chapter by the way, can't wait to see the *real* character sheet.
  ```

  - u/SoylentRox:
    ```
    I'm guessing the author will only convey snippets of it because it sounds like a true game state file that is very, very large.  

    Our hero will need very high intelligence to parse it.  In these kind of games you end up just boosting your INT stat all game long if you're playing a caster, because you need every point you can get.  This seems to be the same way, though for a different reason*.

    *in the games, all the big enemies are 'resistant' to getting hit with magic and you have a better chance the higher your int stat is.  And, of course, the bosses are outright immune to any really 'save or lose' spell, which is why it's generally better to invest in direct damage spells despite them not being very good against mook level enemies...

    And many games try to bring in magic immune enemies, making it where the best role of a caster is buffing your companions, since game developers can't really make enemies immune to physical attacks - that would make warrior and archer characters completely useless.

      Unless the warrior/archer characters have support skills, like healing arrows or something.

  Earmuffs because (NSFL audio warning) [demonic scream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XskZFjsguWE) or because demons are walking talking [memetic/cognito/infohazards](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Information_hazard)?

  - u/SprinklerTesselation:

    I'm thinking tight earmuffs to be worn by the nonanima, because they don't want demons listening in on them.

    From last chapter
    >The kinds of devils that can reach up to puppet her won’t be clever enough to be convincing, and if Fallatehr is smart, he’ll have his people punch her in the mouth if she tries to convince anyone.

    Sounds like you don't want to be listening to demons. Probably because with 9,000 afterlives, all being Hells and no known Heaven, all it gets you is possibly suicidally depressed. Or manipulated and then betrayed.
    ```

    - u/nytelios:
      ```
      > clever enough to be convincing

      So, if the devils are like gaolers who are increasingly clever and insidious with their psychological warfare as you get lower in the hells, then it's possible they've tortured all the dirty laundry out of all the dead people you know. The question is what would they try to convince you of. That all your loved ones are suffering in the worst ways and you should join them out of commiseration? What's their end-game - propagating misery? Or like you say, getting the suicidally depressed as more fodder for the hells?
      ```

- u/xamueljones:
  ```
  Well it looks like you, Joon, shouldn't have been treating social as a dump stat! I predict that the game rewards a generalist over specialist build and that Join will need to use all skills on the sheet in one way or another.

   A further prediction is that Essentialism is the skill to interface with or manipulate the soul while reading/understanding the soul will require the skill Library Magic or Language.

    ```
    Not exactly a typo but your definition of a null pointer error could be misread.

    > the program tries to go look up **what** some variable is, and finds out that there’s a null (empty) value **where that variable was supposed to be**.

    This would be more accurate as

    > the program tries to go look up **where** some variable is, and finds out that there’s a null (empty) value where **that variable's address** was supposed to be.

    Your original read as if the program did the lookup first and found a null where the pointer was pointing, rather than the pointer itself being null.
    ```

    - u/cthulhuraejepsen:
      ```
      This is one of those mistakes that I'd normally be fine with, since it's an understandable mistake in-character, *especially* given that Juniper's skill/knowledge in programming is meant to be equivalent to my own when I was 17, and *I* made the mistake because I didn't look up anything up when writing that.

      But it's also a mistake that doesn't serve a plot purpose and so only serves to annoy people with imprecision, and I would only deliberately include something like that if I were a stickler for verisimilitude, which I'm (mostly) not.

      Grades don't always match one's intelligence, for all sorts of reasons :)

        Of course. But highly correlated! I thought the juxtaposition of 'class' and '15' suggests that it's academically applied.

    - u/cthulhuraejepsen:
      ```
      Fixed all that, thank you.

      Joon is smartish, but has little interest in academics (or extracurriculars) and doesn't apply himself very much, preferring to spend his time and effort on his mildly antisocial hobbies. What Arthur said was more supposed to point to "I've seen how quickly you pick up on new information and solve problems relative to others".

      (I probably won't ever do a full edit this thing, because it's already as long as a doorstopper fantasy epic, but one of the things that I would probably do is add in a few more hints in that direction.)

  So if a demon possesses her. Will the null reference exception be replaced with the demons name? Would that mean that the loyalty metric apply to the demon?

    From programming POV it should. Clearly loyalty is kept externally to the soul of the companion.

    This is apparently a *very* regional term for the ability of a checker to jump more than one piece in sequence. I didn't know *how* regional it was until I started looking for corroboration that other people actually used it; it might actually just be localized to my small town.

    So, apologies for that, because there's no way that you'd be able to get that from the text. (I'm fine with having a little bit of Midwestern cultural artifacts, but that one probably goes too far, given that it's hyperlocal.)
