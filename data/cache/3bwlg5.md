## Trying to remember a comic that appeared here.

### Post:

It was about a man who gets a brain implant, allowing him to interact with his alternate selves as they split twofold every week. Nuclear apocalypses occur in some of the universes, but some survive and people who don't know the anthropic principle are convinced there's a reason. Eventually he and his girlfriend become godlike entities as their subselves try to convert each other to religions.

    Well... that was a unique experience. Somehow simultaneously terrible and amazing.
