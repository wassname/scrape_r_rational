  How did he turn the notion of knowing whether or not the afterlife is better into a dilemma? It's functionally identical to whether or not it's better to live in this town or the next one over. If earth is better then seek to live as long as you can. If the afterlife is better then kill yourself.
  ```

- u/Jinoc:
  ```
  The conclusion is a bit odd. In a world where people are still asking themselves what comes after death, it's quite impossible for the Ouija board to work - hence the entire experiment simply does not work. Of course, the quite likely result is then the death of Control - from realizing her sister sacrificed herself on a lunacy, general depression, etc.
