## I'm planning an r!MLP fic. How can I draw readers past first blush?

### Post:

It's going to be less of a rationality-shits-on-the-world romp (i.e. how I saw Luminosity (which I nevertheless enjoyed) and how HPMOR began) and more of a serious, semi-mature story focused on plot, development, and engagement (like what I think HPMOR became by the end). Like HPMOR, it will begin with the only ostensible difference that a certain character is smarter.

I'm still in the planning stage, since I want to breadcrumb the major plotlines very carefully, but I'm approaching the point where it becomes reasonable to actually start writing. However, I'm worried about the story falling flat on the community, solely for the reason that it's based in ponies. Please take for granted that this plot cannot be written in a non-pony context; changing the setting is not viable. 

I think the title is important. Something facile like "MLP: Science is Magic" (in addition to not really fitting the story) is sure to seem bland and maybe juvenile.

Other than that, I'm not sure what I can do to minimize the effect of the 'ugh field' surrounding the fandom. I think I could, in fact, write smart content compelling to the community, but it seems there would be a strong bias in plenty of individuals to categorically ignore an MLP fic (e.g. I've seen heavy resistance to MLP: Friendship is Optimal recommendations, even though that story *takes place on human Earth*). So I'm very wary of completely wasting my time and effort, since it seems possible to me that the MLP fandom at large might also not be the right audience.

Can you think of anything I can do to ensure the fic is taken seriously? Would you, personally, be willing to give it a shot?

Also, has any straightforward "character X is smarter" MLP fic been (successfully) written before? I haven't really seen anything like that.

Thanks!

  I think Friendship is Optimal was actually quite popular, all things considered. Ultimately, there are a fair amount of limits on what you can do to make a fanfiction popular to an outsider since the range of people who understand it is dependent on the fandom. For example, a fanfiction of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (JoJo's Rational Adventure anyone???) is going to have a smaller audience than a fanfiction of Harry Potter simply because Harry Potter has a much larger fandom and is much more widely consumed in the general populace.

  Picking MLP as your base for your fanfiction will help you because many people are familiar with the original work. It will hurt you because many people are not familiar with the original work. If your goal is to try to get readers who haven't watched MLP, your best tool is probably basing the fic off of something other than MLP. I think MLP has an active fan-community and is widely watched, though, so I wouldn't really worry about this.

    I read Friendship is Optimal before I ever watched an MLP episode. It's what got me into the show. (Figured that if I'd already read a fanfiction I may as well give the show a try.)

  Why wouldn't it be? Sure, [the front page of "hot" stories on FIMFiction.net](http://www.fimfiction.net) is typically plastered with short stories rather than novels of substance--but there are many longer stories that have gained lots of popularity in that fandom (e.g., [\#2](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/67362), [\#3](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/45720), and [\#6](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/18087) among [the top-rated stories of all time](http://www.fimfiction.net/stories/top)--to say nothing of *[Fallout: Equestria](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/119190)*, *[Project Horizons](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/208056)*, the interminable *[Austraeoh](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/25966)* series...).

    Not rationalist but it does have a semi-rational villain arc that I absolutely adore.

    I've started reading Austraeoh, and at least in the beginning, the writing is awful. The prose is 80% purple, and the conjunctions of phrases and clauses are done in the most nonsensical ways.

    I'm still reading it, though. The series is currently 2,382,826 words long; SS&E *has* to have gotten better in that time. If they haven't, well, that's one hypothesis completely obliterated. Although, if only non-purple wordcount (u) decreases your purple ratio (y)...

    Let's say every 1,000 non-purple words decreases your purpleness percentage by 0.1%, a ratio of -1/1000. Every non-purple word shifts purpleness down by 0.0001%, making dy/du = -1/1000000. x is the number of total words, and x and u are related by the equation u = x - yx, the total (x) less the purple wordcount (yx).

    Since we want dy/dx, change in purpleness given a change in total wordcount, we can use the chain rule to get dy/dx = dy/du · du/dx, and since we have u(x, y), we can take the partial derivative with respect to x and obtain du/dx = 1 - y. dy/dx = -1/1000000 · (1 - y) = (y - 1)/1000000.

    Plugging this in to W|A (with y(0) = 0.8 purpleness) (can you tell I gave up on the math?), we get a solution of y(x) = 1 - 0.2e^(x/1000000). This equation gives us a wordcount-to-zero-purpleness of 1,609,437 words. We can then integrate from 0 to 1609437 to get a total purple wordcount of 809438, which, when divided by the series total wordcount, gives us a to-date average purpleness ratio of 0.3396.

    If we change dy/du to reflect a decrease of 0.1% purpleness every 10,000 words, a more conservative estimate, we obtain a total purple wordcount of about 1,844,690 over the entire current run of the story, yet to reach zero purple. This gives us a much more likely to-date average purpleness ratio of 0.7742.

    Whether it's good or bad, 2.4 million words is impressive, to say the least.

      ```
      I stopped reading the *Austraeoh* series somewhere in the middle of the third book--not because of any purpleness (as far as I can remember--this was some years ago), but because there were too many groups of characters in widely-separated locations for me to keep track of.

      In any case, I much prefer *[Background Pony](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/19198)* out of this writer's works--it's probably my third-favorite fanfiction story (behind *[Time Braid](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644)* and *[In the Blood](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6207715)*). IIRC (I last read it quite a while ago, and that was only my second reading of it), it's even more purple than *Austraeoh*, though...

    That's actually a very sensible point that I haven't seen terribly much of in rational fic. I suspect one of the flaws quite common in this community may be to forget that humans (or remarkably human like ponies) are far better served specialising and collaborating with other specialists than we are attempting to be omni-disciplinary geniuses.  
    An MLP fic seems like a very good venue for looking at how to manage a group of diverse specialists towards an end goal none of them could individually achieve.

  I would be strongly resistant to any pony-based fanfic. The reasons that I read *Friendship is Optimal* were that a lot of people highly recommended it to me, it was complete, and it was "not technically fanfic" (in the way that a story about a bunch of people living in a virtual version of the *Enterprise* is not technically fanfic of *Star Trek*).

  I don't actually think that this is an example of an ugh field. It's not a matter of being conditioned against those stories, it's an honest assessment of probability. The odds that *any* fanfic is going to be good is low. The odds that I will enjoy a fanfic about a franchise which I don't enjoy is low. The odds that a given serial work will be abandoned is fairly high. The odds that I will enjoy a serial work which is incomplete is low. The only real way to counter this (for me) is for me to read some rave reviews that cause me to adjust my level of probable enjoyment.

  This leaves you in the Catch-22 that lots of writers fall into; people don't want to read what you've written without assurances that it's good, but people aren't going to assure others that it's good until they've read what you've written. Having it be MLP fanfic only makes this problem more extreme.

  Sorry if I don't have great advice on how to solve this problem. The best I can offer is to just write well continuously until people start to take notice; eventually you'll pass through some barriers as your story garners recommendations, which will get you more readers, which will get you more recommendations. But that takes a lot of time and effort.

    That's how I felt about HPMoR and MLP:FIO, but one of the things that I enjoyed most about them was that they lampshaded the hell out of the things that annoyed me about the canon genres. Inserting a rational or genre-savvy character into any irrational genre is going to have a huge popcorn effect for me.

    And I can't see any rational!MLP that didn't bust the genre actually being rational.

    Starting out with a few genre-busting epiphanies would ensure a jet-assisted take-off.

    ```
    Let me second the recommendation of [Seeking Power](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/174671/seeking-power).  It basically *is* a rational Twilight, grown up and serving as Celestia's chancellor, having to deal with Nightmare Moon's return while having already figured out a lot about the Elements... but Luna is acting sane, and she has her own plans.  This takes place in a somewhat different Equestria from the show, but /u/Calamitizer should definitely read it first.

    I'd also recommend the same author's [The Moon's Apprentice](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/196256/the-moons-apprentice).  In an Equestria starting out very close to the show, Twilight was rejected by Celestia... and mentored by Nightmare Moon in her dreams.
    ```

- u/ArgentStonecutter:
  ```
  I would certainly give it a shot, I enjoyed FIO enough to post geeky rants about the backstory. If the intelligent character ends up deconstructing some of the problems in the genre backstory I will be delighted.

  I seem to recall a couple of munchkin!MPL fics where one character was smarter or more genre-savvy, but I can't pull them to mind right now. I'm not an MLP fan, and I only vaguely recognize the canon characters, so there's no strong anchors to pull them up from the swamp of my memory.

  Edit: I'd also love to see some rational!Elfquest, rational!Xanth, rational!Cerebus, etc etc etc...

  I've seen Twilight in particular be cranked up the genius scale a couple of notches in stuff like [Arrow 18](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/13616/arrow-18-mission-logs-lone-ranger), where she not only learns the language of the protagonist over the course of the story, but a range of advanced science and technology.

  There's also a far more brutally rationalist Twilight in, for example, the AU of [The Moon's Apprentice](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/196256/the-moons-apprentice).

  However, due to the sugarbowl nature of the show, rationalism seems like something which would grate on society in most of Equestria, and be treated almost as a moderate-to-severe personality fault. You could probably get away with doing rationalist Star Swirl, but for any other character you'd have to have some reason as to how they managed to function in Equestria, unless they were part of a non-pony society (for example, being a diamond dog).

  It'd also be interesting to see a non-unicorn rationalist. While magic is the obvious overpowered leverage point in MLP fic, how might a pegasus or earth pony rationalist take action?

    Why do you think being rational implies being anti-social?

    The biggest impediment to a rationalist FIM is that there isn't much consistency in the world building. Especially early on. A lot of that is due to being an episodic cartoon.
    ```

    - u/NotAHeroYet:
      ```
      Maybe his only mental model of rationalism is mostly HPMOR!harry, who at times has a holier-than-thou attitude to every character in the story, or close enough. Harry generally is socially decent, but he does have issues with being subordinate to others. his nature as [if you read it you know this spoiler] gives a good background for this, but it's easy to associate rationalism with this, especially since it's one of the most obvious rationalfic.
      ```

    - u/Geminii27:
      ```
      Rational doesn't necessarily imply being anti-social. However, someone who has the strength of character to take rationalist actions in the face of social expectations or norms could easily be perceived as such.

      It's entirely possible to write about a character who follows social expectations 95% of the time and fits in rationalist actions around the sides and edges of those expectations (or takes actions which are not optimal, but are as much so as they can manage while still conforming to others' expectations), but that's rather softer and more balanced than most of the rationalist fiction I've read, which has a tendency to leap for the jugular.

    Hello, this is a holy war.  What makes you think that clear thinking and goal-directed action are, to put it lightly, *mean and nasty*?  That is, since when is *rationality* something that *spoils all the sugar*?
    ```

    - u/Geminii27:
      ```
      Speculation. Rationality tend to be written about in fiction as a single clear-headed protagonist acting on rational principles, often regardless of whether that would cause friction with other characters or the society they're in. Equestria appears to rate friendship and sociality above the kind of single-minded focus characteristic of, for example, pre-S1 Twilight Sparkle.

      Of course, what might be interesting is a rational character who *embraces* the tenets of Equestria and deliberately sets out to enhance themselves and others through friendship and close relationships.

      Thinking further, there's also the issue of Celestia. It's not unknown for rationalist characters to become sufficiently powerful (or at least influential) that their actions start having political consequences. It's not too far a stretch to imagine that at some point, Celestia is going to want to talk to such a character. Depending on the character's intelligence and willingness to compromise, and the degree of flexibility Celestia is being written with, there may or may not be conflict between their visions for the future.

  http://www.fimfiction.net/group/1418/lesswrong has a lot of similar fiction to what you suggest.  I don't think the basic straightforward HPMOR premise of making just a few characters smarter and only tweaking the world building slightly has been done before all the way to a good and complete fic.  The Great Alicorn Hunt and Mortal are both pretty close to that premise though.  I like MLP fanfiction and I think on average MLP fanfiction is better than other fanfic (like 99% of other fanfic is crap while only 80-90% of MLP fanfic is crap if I stick to fimfiction) so I would probably read any r!MLP that you write, but if you want to really catch my attention, an original and clever deviation different from the straightfoward make x,y and z characters smarter would be required.

        When you write fanfic, you're making a transformative work. Sometimes this is an extension of the work, other times it's commentary on the work, but it's (almost always) contained within that created world itself.

        Works like *FiO* are a level up. It's like the difference between putting on your own production of *Lysistrata* and putting on a production of a play about a production of *Lysistrata*. The additional meta level is not at all trivial; it makes the work about a totally different thing. *Lysistrata* is about sex, feminism, and society. A play about a production of *Lysistrata* will necessarily have to be about how people interact with *Lysistrata*, about art as representation, and about producing meaning in art (also, likely about interpersonal relationships between actors, directors, etc.).

        That change in focus that comes with switching levels makes a huge difference in what the work is about and who might like it.
        ```

        - u/Chronophilia:
          ```
          I don't think that's it. Fanfiction does not have to deal with the same themes as the source material. Nor does it have to use the same characters, or happen in the same world. It should almost certainly fit one of those three criteria, but none are mandatory.

          Fanfiction is a label which tells the reader to refer to the original work for context, such as themes, characterisation, worldbuilding, and emotional investment. Subpar fanfic authors use this to patch over parts of the story where their own writing is lacking. It's a label which has to be added by the author, either explicitly or by using names from the source material. It's a label which can be deliberately removed, too - *50 Shades of Grey* is not *Twilight* fanfiction, even if it's only a find-replace away.

          In any case, *Friendship is Optimal* is not about the creation of the TV series *My Little Pony*, it's about the creation of a (fictitious) AI based on it. And if a story about creating a simulated world based on an in-universe television series isn't fanfiction, then *[The Finale of the Ultimate Mega Meta Crossover](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5389450/1/The-Finale-of-the-Ultimate-Meta-Mega-Crossover)* isn't fanfiction of anything other than *Permutation City*.

          *Friendship is Optimal* also uses a lot of tropes that are characteristic of MLP fanfic. There's plenty of other stories about Equestria contacting Earth and humans turning into ponies, which I will not list here as they don't deserve the attention. FiO doesn't fall on the blurry line of genre boundaries, it's so far inside the fanfic norm that it's in a well-documented subgenre.
          ```

          - u/alexanderwales:
            ```
            We just disagree with what makes the label "fanfiction" appropriate then, which is not going to make for a good conversation. I think what I disagree with most strongly is the idea that an author has some ultimate authority in deciding what labels can or should apply to their work (though I don't deny that they have *some*).

            My argument against *FiO* being fanfiction is that it doesn't take place within that world (except where that world is acknowledged as purely fictional), it doesn't share any characters (except when those characters are acknowledged as purely fictional), and so far as I can tell isn't about any of the same things as *My Little Pony* (though I'll admit to not having watched more than a few episodes). So I don't see how it's any more fanfiction than a story about the production of the television series would be fanfiction, or a story about someone watching the show, or a story about a fan convention, regardless of whether the author thinks that it's fanfiction or not.

            But as I said, it's a difference in definitions, which means that we're not going to convince each other.
            ```

            - u/Chronophilia:
              ```
              The real-life *My Little Pony* franchise does exist within *Friendship is Optimal*, and it's acknowledged as fictional. And if the story had ended in the first couple of chapters I wouldn't be confused. But *Equestria Online* is Iceman's invention, extrapolating from the real-life MLP episodes, just like fanfiction. It's like if someone wrote a story about the production of Season 8 of the TV series, and included detailed storyboards or scripts of the episodes. Is that just fanfiction with a framing device? That can't be right.

              I'm sorry, I shouldn't be looking for an argument. I know you're a better writer than me, I just want your advice. Is the distinction between fictional-fictional and fictional-real important here, or am I missing the point?
              ```

              - u/alexanderwales:
                ```
                I guess I think of labels as being about predictive power, and one of the reasons that I exclude meta-level works like this from "fanfiction" is that I think they don't often share too much with other things that we'd agree are fanfiction.

                I think giving *FiO* the label "fiction about *My Little Pony*" gives a far better idea of *what it is* than saying "fanfiction of *My Little Pony*". It's obviously moot here, because we've both read it and know what it is more fully than the distinction could encompass.
                ```

              >  it doesn't share any characters (except when those characters are acknowledged as purely fictional), 

              To some extent, I feel this is false. It felt to me pretty obvious when reading that David, the character who eventually comes to identify with the name Light Sparks, is pretty much intended to be a Twi**light** **Spark**le expy in many ways, for all his initial humanity and gender; And David is a product of the 'real world' of the story, at least initially, as opposed to the world-within-a-world containing meta-fictional characters. 

              That said, whether or not FiO 'is fanfiction' or not is the sort of meaningless label-fight that comes down to arguing about what the definition of various labels 'should' be, and is therefore completely pointless to debate or discuss. 

              For what it's worth, I don't like MLP:FIM canon / source material very much, and there are like ~3 stories that come from it's source material that I enjoy, of which FiO is far and away the best.

        I'm saying that *here* mostly because if someone wants to know how to get around the fact that people have pony aversion, they probably want to hear from someone who actually experiences pony aversion.

        Are you suffering from the typical mind fallacy? Sometimes when a person says that they don't love ponies, it's not because they're lying for some absurd reason, it's because they actually don't love ponies.

      I'm kinda... neutral towards ponies I guess?

  Considering the resounding success of Friendship is optimal (even though it isn't really a fanfic) and Fallout: Equestria (even though it isn't quite rational) I'm sure there's a big enough overlap to get you an initial audience. If it turns out to be good, word of mouth will be enough to bring more people to it.

  I personally don't have any problem with MLP, and I was surprised to discover that apparently there's an 'ugh field'. I didn't think MLP had much more 'ugh' attached to it than the general 'ugh fanfiction', and I thought that here we were generally over that one, since, you know, HPMOR.

  I would suggest something that nobody else has here: Figure out why there is an ugh field around MLP fandom.  Then try to figure out how--or if--you can demonstrate that the reasons for that field don't apply.

  (I suspect a lot of it is just Bayseianism about what can be predicted about a person, on the average, from the knowledge that he is a MLP fan.  And you can't just tell people not to be Bayseian.)

    ```
    It sounds to me like you are stereotyping.

    Realistically, the only thing that you can tell on average from the fact that someone is an MLP fan is that they are an MLP fan.
