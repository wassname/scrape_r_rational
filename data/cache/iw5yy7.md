## Zorian Gets a Muffin; or, "Using GPT-2 autocorrect to write MoL fanfiction"

### Post:

Quite a while ago I trained a copy of DistilGPT-2 on about 25 chapters of Mother of Learning.  I decided that I had set the learning rate too low and left it alone.  Recently I dusted off the trained file and plugged it into [a Python script I wrote](https://github.com/anonymousAwesome/GPT2-Interactive) to help me use GPT-2 in a creative writing context.  

The bolded text is material I added myself.  Everything else was created by the trained DistilGPT-2 suggesting 20 results (the 10 most likely and 10 of the less likely results) and me picking the one I liked the most.

**Title: Zorian Gets a Muffin**

**One sentence summary:**  
Zorian decides to get a muffin for his sister. This is not a trivial feat.

**One-paragraph summary:**  
Zorian initially tried to make some basic changes to the recipe for a muffin, but it didn't work. Then he went out to buy some muffins, but failed, because they cost too much. After that he realized that the recipe was wrong, because it had some problematic effects on the equipment. He then went back to his home and created a batch of muffins for everyone.

**Name: Zorian Kazinski**  
**Role: Protagonist**  
**Goal:** to make a muffin for everyone  
**Values:** intelligence, competence  

Name: Galina Tatchell  
Role: Dessert Maker  
Goal: to make the best quality of cake  
Values: skill, creativity  

**Location:** The Dessert Maker

**Plot outline:  
Zorian was introduced.  
Zach was introduced.  
Zorian bantered with Zach a bit about making muffins.    
Zorian described the changes he made to the recipe.  
Zorian's attempts to make muffins failed.  
Zach left the room.  Zorian left the house.  
Zorian couldn't find any open bakeries except for The Dessert Maker.  
Zorian talked with Galina about muffins.  
Galina only made desserts and refused to make muffins for Zorian.  
Galina offered to make muffins at high prices as a custom order.  
Zorian argued with Galina, in the process realizing what went wrong with his recipe.  
Zorian went home and makes the muffins correctly.**  

Zorian Kazinski was staring at the kitchen counter in frustration. His thoughts were completely negative, because this was the third time he had tried to make muffins. The reason for his failure was not obvious, and it was very likely that he would not be able to fix the problem. The only reason he was still trying was because he had already said he would make muffins for everyone in the house.

"What's going on here?" Zach asked. "I guess you're trying to fix the recipe?"

Zorian nodded and said, "I don't understand what's going on. The first time I tried this, I used the recipe without any modifications. The second time I tried to change the ingredients, and the third time I didn't even use the recipe. So why did I still get the same results?"

"I guess the problem is that you're trying to make muffins," Zach said. "You shouldn't even be in the kitchen."

Zorian glared at Zach.

  ```
  Slightly off topic but once GPT-3 becomes pay-to-use next month (and it is *very* expensive) it'll really put a lid on this kind of fun. Something like AiDungeon just won't be commercially viable anymore.
  ```

    ```
    Um, the version of AiDungeon that requires GPT-3 is already pay-to-use. The one that uses gpt-2 is free, but you will be able to run that on your own with a GTX 3070 Ti anyways. Or you can run it on your cpu now, if you don't mind waiting 2-3 minutes for a prediction.
    Edit: Seems like they changed the free version from gpt-2 to a smaller size gpt-3 version. Hmm.
