  Did I understand this correctly?

  [](#s "There's a colony where they worship science.  They are doing experiments on what gets you into Heaven, and they've determined that torturing people to death has positive correlation with Heaven-access, so they're doing that.  And it turns out that all of this is a trick from a bunch of Earthpeople who are...tricking them into doing horrific experiments so that they can have the results of the research without have to torture teenagers themselves?")

    That was my reading of it. [](#s "Using religion as a way of tricking people into doing medical experiments for you.")

      This was how I understood it as well.

    [](#s "The experiments have nothing to do with heaven. They're just ordinary medical experiments. The belief (which is a falsity purported by the earthers) is that, (apparently) everyone gets into heaven, but you are placed into a more pleasurable heaven if you died in a medical experiment, with the pleasurablity of the heaven being correlated with the pain you suffered in the experiment, such that it is morally good to sacrifice even possibly unwilling or unknowing people in the experiment.")

    I got the impression it was to exploit a loophole in their laws and/or moral beliefs, as well. [](#s "Hence the analogy to Jehova's Witnesses and blood transfusion.")

  I assume a bunch of people here are SMBC fans, but I don't recall seeing this, so here we go. A short comic-story about a colony where science is the religion. I, for one, find it pretty seductive.

  Wow, dark.

  How many other people are deciding to support the Kickstarter because of this comic? I'm went from ignoring it to kinda being on the fence about getting a copy thanks to this blog post.

  [My interpretation:](#s "There are some randomized controlled trials that we would not perform here on Earth for ethical reasons. However, from a utilitarian perspective, if the outcomes lead to future benefits, they would be deemed 'acceptable' by this colony of religious Salkans. However, it is impossible to tell from the comic whether or not the experiments are actually designed rationally. They start off talking about how many cures they have, but are they truly derived from the best designed RCTs possible? If so, why is torture even a part of it? I can't think of any part of medical science where developing a cure involves torture...")

  [I have one example that haunts me ever since my college embryology course.](#s "It raises all sorts of ethical questions and to even think it all the way through turns my stomach. Let me go so far as to say that it involves a mutation in the gene called "Sonic Hedgehog" and suggest that all Salkans have a twin.")
