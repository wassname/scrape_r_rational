  "Mad Science" as a mental-illness that costs you your genre-savviness in return for the insight to build advanced technology is an old trope; but nobody's done it as well, or as rationally, as *A Miracle of Science*.

  An excellent work, in my opinion. Though I may be biased. "A Miracle of Science" was one of the first webcomics I ever read. I think the only thing I read before that was Andy Weir's "Casey and Andy" strip. Sadly, after ending that, Mr. Weir had to make do with writing a best-selling novel that was made into a very popular movie. And hey, the novel and movie heavily feature Mars, as does "A Miracle of Science." You see how I came full circle?

  This has been posted a couple of times, but as far as I'm concerned it warrants reposting once in a while. Really enjoyable work, highly recommended. Pretty original, too, at least at the time it was released.

  Never really mad to see this again.  Some good fiction
