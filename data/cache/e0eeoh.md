  Pure monster madness. Loved every minute. Until now, there hasn't been a lot of animal-v-animal action in this fic, but it seems that this set of chapters is finally getting that all out of the system. With regards to the note about 30,000 word chapters, I say that splitting them in half is ideal - or even into thirds. A 15,000 word chapter is already a *lot*. Even 10,000 is plenty to chew on. And I like the pace of one chapter every two weeks.

  So, a few blow-by-blows, or rather, aspect-by-aspects.

  I really like the atmosphere of this chapter - the whole dark and misty forest setting, where things are too quiet, where monsters lurk around every corner. This gave me some of my favorite mental imagery from the fic so far. So the way I savor fics like this is that I produce and direct a wish-fulfillment HBO miniseries production in my head - and I do mean this literally, as I tend to plan out the details of the filmography and the precise script changes that would be necessary to make the translation to the screen - and this chapter gave me *plenty* of setpieces and creature design to work with, let me tell you.

  The multiple Marco perspectives: very interesting. I was expecting each successive POV Marco to die horribly until there was only one left, but there was a smaller body count than I anticipated. Well, there still is the other half of this mission to go. But if this many Marcos have made it this far, that indicates to me that the *true* body count will start when they reach the Arn / Howlers. Really, the Ellimist / Crayak were doing the Animorphs a favor by making them go through the forest, as this has given them many powerful morphs they wouldn't have gotten otherwise.

  So towards the end of the chapter, it seems like Marco's sense of being localized in one body is beginning to slip, and this is reflected in the narrative, which did get a bit confusing at times. In the section where one of the Marcos is dying, the narrator seems to switch freely from the ground to another nearby Marco. My interpretation of this was that one of the other Marcos acquired the dying Marco, morphed him right there, and absorbed his memories, giving this Marco the experience of remembering being on the verge of death and also watching himself on the verge of death. Very cool dynamic. Is there any other fiction out there that comes close to this level of weirdness?

  Alright, now for That Part:

  >“Shut up,” Jake whispered.  Edging closer, he leaned over and pressed their foreheads together, whispering something I couldn’t hear.  Then he tilted his head, and lowered his lips to the other boy’s—

  >\-------------------------

  >“Yeah,” he said.  “It’s just—first time.  You know.  Since Cassie.”

  >*Both, obviously*.

  Welp. Once again this fic surprises me. This is everything I've ever wanted. I've shipped these two since I was a confused gay kid reading Animorphs in middle school. But even if you're not a shipper, I think this works as a realistic and touching moment - even if Jake and Marco are just friends, I *love* Jake's display of emotion here for his best friend. I think this might be realistic even if Jake were straight - and not bisexual as he's implied to be here - I have a vague notion that throughout history there were times and cultures where men were much more open about expressing affection for one another. It's just a human thing.

  >“You, uh,” Jake said, faltering.  “You and me—”  
  >  
  >“To be perfectly honest, we’re kind of more into Rachel these days.”

  BOOOOOOO. Go back to Jake you fool, BOOOOOO

    > as this has given them many powerful morphs they wouldn't have gotten otherwise

    One of the things I always hated about the *Sario Rip* books is that they never let the Animorphs *keep* the stuff they acquired during the trips.  This will not be the case in r!Animorphs—Marco now just straight-up *has* a Tarmogoyf morph.

    > this chapter gave me plenty of setpieces and creature design to work with, let me tell you.

    <3 <3 <3  I also think pretty visually/cinematically while writing, and was glad to hear that I was able to transmit some of that.

    > Is there any other fiction out there that comes close to this level of weirdness?

    Also <3.  Although my *true* hope is that I can sneak in all of the weirdness without anyone really noticing until it's too late, and then you're trying to describe it to your friend as if it's all very sensible and consequential and obvious and they're just looking at you like **??????**

    > I think this might be realistic even if Jake were straight - and not bisexual as he's implied to be here - I have a vague notion that throughout history there were times and cultures where men were much more open about expressing affection for one another. It's just a human thing.

    FWIW, my own interpretation as the author is that Jake is straight; we saw him being similarly accepting and affectionate when he realized Marco was in love with him on the mesa.

    But also, I don't currently intend to confirm in-text the sexuality of any characters besides Rachel and Marco, in part because I want to leave readers to be able to make generous interpretations such as the one above.  I don't think bisexual Jake is *incompatible* with the story as written, and I'm going to try to keep it that way.
    ```

      ```
      > FWIW, my own interpretation as the author is that Jake is straight;  

      Oh, I see; that's what I *thought*, but in this chapter some of the stuff seemed to subtly but explicitly confirm that he was bi. For example:

      >“Yeah,” he said.  “It’s just—first time.  You know.  Since Cassie.”  
      >  
      >I just barely managed to catch the question before it left my lips, stopped the words from becoming real at the last possible second.  
      >  
      >*Both, obviously*.

      I took Jake's line to mean that he was open to relationships with guys, just that he hadn't been thinking about relationships for a while. And I took Marco's "both, obviously" as him answering an implied question in his head - that Jake is into *both* genders, and Marco is just now seeing the signs. I was kind of surprised you would actually do that, given that in previous comments sections you said you wouldn't go further in that direction, but I guess these lines meant something else after all?
      ```

      - u/TK17Studios:
        ```
        "It's just—first time.  You know.  Since Cassie."

        "First kiss since Cassie?  Or first time watching a dear friend die?"

        But not including that line in the text was a deliberate choice.  I tried it both ways, and it felt better letting the reader use their own model of Marco to decide what he was thinking in that moment.  In other words, consider my answer here omake; your version is just as valid according to me.
        ```

        - u/CouteauBleu:
          ```
          Also, technically Jake didn't watch Cassie die, he just watched her make a terrible decision that drastically shortened her lifespan.
          ```

    ```
    > it seems like Marco's sense of being localized in one body is beginning to slip

    A possible consequence is that if some number of Marclones ever become Collaborators, that sense of self-as-values will propagate through Terra, which could have weird effects on the Unity vs. Harmony aspect of the game. Especially after Perdão goes back for the sharing.

    Marco probably wouldn't remember the death - the construct instance only remembers what happened up until before it went to sleep the previous day, not whatever happened right before being acquired.

  Alright, let's do a quick review.

  > People don’t understand the word ruthless. They think it means mean.  Cold.  Heartless. It’s about being able to see that thin, bright line that leads from point A to point B—that one, narrow path that dodges all the dead ends.  It’s about seeing that bright, clear line, and not caring about anything but the beautiful fact that you’ve found the solution.  Not caring about anything else but the perfection of it.

  Yes! The ruthlessness speech!

  Easily one of the best parts of canon Animorphs, from one of the best books.

  I really like this take on the speech, too. Now all we need is Marco threatening to murder Visser One and feeling conflicted about it and we'll hit peak awesomeness!

  > Point B: Jake and Helium—at least—alive and well at the bottom.

  Gee, I'm a little worried by how the number of surviving non-suicidal Animorphs seems to be dwindling chapter by chapter.

  > ‹Hedwig here,› I called out.  ‹Crossing the boundary now, over.›

  You know, I'm realizing just now that Harry Potter references have taken the place of Star Trek references in canon. I wonder if they'll age better.

  > Or like how there were no other plants in the forest at all.  No bushes, no ferns, no flowers or vines.  Not even any saplings or seedlings that I could see—just giant, silent pillars of wood, stretching up for what might have actually been miles.

  I wonder at the biological aspect of these trees. I mean, there's a reason trees in real life rarely grow the size of a skyscraper. The weight that the base of these trees have to support must be *insane*. They probably have a super-advanced internal flora keeping them together (aside from the Hork Bajirs tending to them).

  > Well.  Not like we were spares, exactly.  Not like seven copies of one person.  More like—like one person in seven bodies.  Like there really was just one individual there, like there was some essential thing that was “Marco,” and instead of plugging into the rest of the universe in one spot, it was now plugging in through all seven of us.  The same software, running on seven different machines.

  I don't have much to say, except I like the exploration on transhumanism we get here. Very Rick and Morty.

  > “He’s not talking about himself,” I cut in, my throat strangely dry.  “He’s saying it’s stupid that morphing technology can’t fix this, when it clearly could.”

  Come on, dude, it's called suspension of disbelief. Stop questioning every little thing already.

  > “Shut up,” Jake whispered.  Edging closer, he leaned over and pressed their foreheads together, whispering something I couldn’t hear.  Then he tilted his head, and lowered his lips to the other boy’s—

  ... :(

  Please don't make a habit of doing this, Jake.

  > “Because,” said Marco, grinning.  “Couldn’t see—that well.”

  You know, moments like this I realize you've really nailed these characters. Marco making one last dumb joke as he's dying is a perfect character moment, and a good throwback to Jake's death scene. Also it's a nice joke.

  > “To be perfectly honest, we’re kind of more into Rachel these days.”

  THE SHIP! IT'S ALIVE!

  > *I can’t save you, that other version of me had said.  I’m sorry.  If I could save you, I would.  But the morphing tech doesn’t do that.  What it can do is give you a chance to make a difference.  Like donating your organs, except instead of organs, you’re donating a whole person.  And that person will fight—for you, for your family, for everyone you’re leaving behind.  As long as there’s an Earth to fight for, he’ll fight for it.* Those words seemed hollow, now.  Cheap.  Almost manipulative.  

  Nooo, nothing manipulative about saying that to these people!

  > The monster was alone, cutting sideways across the slope, moving maybe ten or twelve miles per hour.  It was huge, easily twice as tall and twice as long as our current best morph, making the trees around it seem almost normal-sized.  Its armor was like the result of a genetic experiment crossing an Ankylosaurus with a Stegosaurus, all thick bone with various knobs and spikes sticking out, some as big as Christmas trees.  It had four massive, muscled limbs, splayed out to the side like a lizard, each ending in a giant, five-clawed foot the size of a backyard pool.  And its head—
  >
  > Its head was like something out of a nightmare, all exposed bone and pulsing flesh.  The whole thing was split down the center, with teeth lining the gap, as if the entire skull could yawn open like a Venus flytrap.  There was also a normal set of jaws, like those you’d expect on an Earth animal, but inside of those were more jaws—an entire second set of teeth, the absolute smallest of which was at least three feet long.  And there were eyes everywhere—eyes like a spider’s, black and round and utterly soulless.
  >
  > I’d seen a lot of monsters over the past twelve hours.  But this was the first one that looked like it might honestly have a chance against Godzilla.

  How the hell did Hedwig-Marco acquire that thing?

  Is it because of bats and humans are to small for it to even notice them?

    > How the hell did Hedwig-Marco acquire that thing?  Is it because of bats and humans are to small for it to even notice them?

    Yeah.  He landed on it, chilled out for a while, nothing happened.  Demorphed halfway, to see if the increased weight would catch its attention; nothing happened.  Plenty of spines to grab onto, so he wouldn't get rolled around.  Eventually demorphed all the way, quickly acquired it, remorphed and GTFO'd.

  Got as far as this tonight:

  >Jake lifted his head slowly, his expression tired.  “They’re dead,” he said flatly, looking my doppelganger straight in the eye.  “Right?  I mean, that’s what we’ve got to assume.”

  And I'm sad the Marclones didn't figure out that they could communicate by acquiring morphs off of each other. If they morphed a bat and an owl acquired from the vanguard and tried to fly, they could easy confirm that they're still alive.

    This is A+ rationality/munchkining, but note that it assumes that there's no localization at all to the morph control signals.

    We've seen some instances of Z-space stuff that *is* location-independent (discussion of the quantum virus), but we've also seen some instances of Z-space stuff that *isn't* location-independent (Helium thinking in the previous chapter that if V3 is controlling doombots outside the Earth system, he needs previously-unheard-of technology).

    It's a shame they haven't at least *checked,* though.

      I was really surprised they didn't think of this, because they used the shared gorilla morph; which means they had to specifically plan around the interference in their morphing strategy.

      > ...next to four *outrageously* massive gorillas—...“If you think about it, gorillas don’t know any bodybuilding techniques, so we’ve probably never seen one at full strength.”

      I didn't get this part. Are the Marcos experimenting with the morph-altering technique Cassie discovered to make gorillas with super gorilla levels of size and strength, or is Marco just commenting on regular gorilla outrageous massitude?

      > ‹So, uh.  Turns out you can heal injuries without demorphing all the way.›

      What happens if you go partway into morph armor, stop before your brain copies over, and wait out the time limit? Is it possible to end up alive and "trapped" in a partial morph, and could that be a way to heal your natural body?

      Another thing I've been wondering about since the canon books, is how powerful is the acquiring trance? If a monster's about to eat you, can you hold out your hands, focus on acquiring it, and have a chance to survive by putting it into trance the moment its teeth touch your skin? If someone like Cassie were infested with a hostile Yeerk, could she rebel Mr.-and-Mrs.-Chapman-in-book-2 style, take control of the morphing power just long enough to start acquiring the Yeerk in her head, and then use the (couple? few? many?) seconds the trance lingers after to go into morph armor, focusing on her brain first, and morph out from under the Yeerk?

      (Not the morph armor part obviously, but 10 year old me was straight-up *angry* that Jake didn't start acquiring the Yeerk in book 6 the second it touched his ear.)

      I gotta figure out what I did with my list of r!Animorphs theories and questions I started making this time last year. This revival is seriously gonna be hard to beat as far as Christmas presents go this year.

        You guys have maybe convinced me to be ashamed that **I** didn't think of it, and to have them come up with it in future chapters and also kick themselves for not thinking of it sooner.  :P

        > probably never seen one at full strength

        It's literally a meme, of the sort you'd find on imgur or r/teenagers; I'm outing Marco as a *memester.*  None of them as-yet have the faculty with morph alteration that Cassie exhibited; she was somewhat genetically lucky as well as having an unusually good experience set (just as none of them can quiiiiite morph-scream as good as Garrett).

        > What happens if you go partway into morph armor, stop before your brain copies over, and wait out the time limit? Is it possible to end up alive and "trapped" in a partial morph, and could that be a way to heal your natural body?

        It all depends on which parts of you are gone; remember that morphing is only partially controllable through deliberate effort.

        If you're going into your morph armor, you have the benefit of not having to deal with autoimmune rejection, which is good.  But there's also the fact that your veins and arteries and capillaries and organ boundary membranes and so forth won't necessarily be exactly lined up; the morphing tech does some handwaving with force fields and nanotech to keep you alive and not in screaming pain while everything swaps out, but if you just stop halfway and wait for the battery to run out I suspect you'd have Problems.

        The acquiring trance is a little more powerful in my canon than in the original books, where it didn't happen 100% of the time; in my version of things, Seerow put it in as an *absolutely necessary* subtool for acquiring hostile animals, not to mention that it has the side effect of making scanning easier (since things are moving slower/less).  It's enough to force docility and lethargy; not enough to force unconsciousness.  If you've ever seen a Corgi or some other small dog just go oof after you put a thundershirt on them, that's about the level of it.  Anything full-on attacking you will stop, but you won't necessarily take all of the strength out of a jaw chomp; the jaws will probably still close around you and if the monster is big enough you're still in a pretty tight situation at that point.

        The problem with trying to morph out from under a Yeerk is that the morphing tech wouldn't leave it behind; you probably *could* seize control long enough to start morphing, but you'd be sending both your own brain *and* the controlling Yeerk into Z-space, and the emulator tech would spin up a copy of you-and-Yeerk, not just-you.  I don't think you could focus subtly enough/specifically enough/give the right set of commands for it to disentangle the Yeerk from your brain physiology, especially in the middle of a mental struggle.  The tech *can* do things that subtle, but it can't do *anything* that subtle; it's like a Mac, or a well-trained machine learning algorithm.

        +1 to things-would've-gone-better if Jake had acquired Temrash the second it touched his ear in canon.

        - u/FireNexus:
          ```
          Wouldn’t it be potentially dangerous, though? Like, didn’t morphing the same animal disrupt the control of all versions of the morph? So, they might morph this animal and confirm Hedwig is alive only to cause him to die due to temporarily jamming his morph. No safe way to use that in this situation, that I can think of.
          ```

          - u/TK17Studios:
            ```
            Agree re: dangerous; I think the scenario they were considering is one where *Hedwig* is the original controller of whatever morph they use to communicate, and somebody uphill sits around in that morph 24/7.

            When it's safe, Hedwig morphs into that body, and the person uphill starts twitching, but Hedwig himself isn't experiencing problems.

            Still assumes that there's no locality, though, so it might not work.

    Only if they're still in those morphs, and at the risk of killing them if they're in a tight spot.

    Still, it's probably only a slight risk, and if they're willing to sacrifice themselves anyway, it's not obvious to me that it would be a bad experiment to run. And if the current plan was "go down, then come back up", they could use this to avoid the "come back up".

    ... It occurs to me that you could use this for FTL communication, but of course this universe has that anyway.

      >At the risk of killing them

      I don't think so?

      1. Alice plans on flying down. Morphs into Alice->Bat.
      2. Bob acquires Bob->Alice->Bat.
      3. Alice flies down.
      4. Bob morphs into Bob->Alice->Bat, checks for twitching.

      If Alice is moving then Bob twitches, but Alice is not affected by this in any way. This does only check for the existence of Alice->Bat, if Alice morphs something else it won't do anything.
      ```

      - u/philh:
        ```
        Oh, yeah! If Bob can avoid interfering with Alice by staying still, I don't see a problem.

        - u/notgreat:
          ```
          You don't even need that. The interference is one-way. When Tobias and Garrett were flying, Garrett was twitching but Tobias was fine. This is because Garrett->Tobias->Bird has two layers pf Yeerk tissue receiving commands at the same time. Tobias->Bird is completely safe since it only has one layer of Yeerk tissue.

    Tobias and Terra will figure out how to munchkin the morphing power to grow Terra extremely quickly. If it's less concerned about this:

    > “—one who has become both twice as angry and twice as patient is not in any sense the same, and the nature of Yeerks is such that twice the flesh is twice the personality.”

    than V3 is, Terra can have small sacrificial shards acquire and morph the entire coalescion, doubling the amount of co-operation and empathy Yeerk flesh available as often as it wants. The resistance could kidnap and acquire Silat hosts by being sneaky, replace their Yeerks with Terra shards, and slowly contaminate Silat with the true meaning of friendship.

    Even better, one sacrificial shard of Terra could acquire the coalescion and infiltrate Silat. As soon as it hits the pool, it starts morphing into Terra, focusing on taking Silat into the morph with it. Any shards of Silat that went into the pool to investigate anything would be replaced by Terra Collaborator shards, and they would all come out reporting nothing unusual.

    If the anti-morphing ray is a concern, they could take advantage of the fact that Yeerk shards are the only sentients small enough to have a morph time long enough for their construct bodies to gain and use the morphing power. Nest 160 tardigrade morphs inside each other, so that the average ~45 seconds it takes for each nested morph to emerge and start demorphing gets them through two hours in the anti-morph field without being discovered. Nested inside the 160th tardigrade morph is a full-sized, morph-capable Terra coalescion, broken into however many nested morphs are needed to get the right time limit.

    (Not theorizing, but- This whole bit with Marco having made duplicates of himself and having a protocol for working with himself is great, and seeing the bright clear line speech made me grin.)

    Alright, here's a theoretical thought; If the animorphs know the Arn are genius bioengineers, and also know they keep morphs they acquire here (or at least, have no reason to think they won't) then the most important thing for them to do is to acquire an Arn and make it back to earth. Depending on how much intervention from on high is going on and how much the Arn rely on infrastructure they couldn't build themselves, that could be the most important thing they do here.

    Imagine being able to custom build morphs. The Arn can do big and stompy, could they do a full out Godzilla? The goal of the mists means they focus on the obviously scary, but could they do a bat but with cockroach survival and black mamba venom? That's just playing around with chimera, can they make a controller-sniffing dog or something that could handle hard vacuum? Can we go full Yuuzhan Vong, and then morph the results? The main limitation on a morpher is what morphs they have available, which means bioengineering has the potential to get gamebreaking.

    Heck, we've already mentioned the intelligence explosion and different aliens being smarter than other aliens. The solution to the alignment problem is right here- have an Arn (or yourself, in an Arn morph) bioengineer something that is to Andalites as Andalites are to Gedd, keep it unconscious, acquire it, morph it, use that to design the next iteration. It seems like the Yeerk control mechanism can work on something smarter than you are (unless Yeerks are smarter than Andalites) so you have all the upsides of that brilliant mind yoked to the morpher's values.

    Do I think that's going to happen? I dunno, but if nobody thinks of morphing an Arn and custom building stuff to morph I'll be surprised. Also, the idea of morphing a Yeerk resulting in morphing a whole pool feels like setup for someone doing that at some point, and if I had a Yeerk the size of a swimming pool I'd be curious what happened if it infested a brain the size of a lake. . .
    ```

    - u/daytodave:

      Ooh! In canon, the animorphs trade their memories to the Iskroot for local money and a guide. I wonder if they'll end up trading tissue samples from earth morphs to acquire the Arn. (We know from Ax that, like in canon, earth has an astounding level of biodiversity compared to other planets.)

    ```
    Elfangor was able to say the words "Crayak" and "Ellimist" when they morphed him because, as a morph, his Andalite brain was joined with Yeerk tissue. That is or has something to do with the special Andalite-Yeerk superbond the avatar confirmed, and it has to do at least partly with being able to access knowledge that E and C have hidden.

    The Yeerk-Andalite superbond is part of the next stage of the game, which is why certain thoughts and ideas are locked off from both species until after they've joined together. One of the things at stake in this stage is whether that bond will be dominated by a single United Visser 3 mind controlling millions of bodies, or a Harmony of Helium-like cooperating systems.

    I was wondering something about the morphing tech in this continuity. Why even morph? Why not just summon construct bodies from Z-space and remote control them from some safe location. I suspect that to Seerow, the ability to turn into animals wasn't the point of the tech. It was made primarily to access the gods' domain, and the construct body was simply meant to be an anchor to return to real space. Although I'm pretty sure it was more convincing to investors to say 'I'm developing a new weapon to aid in the war effort' rather than 'I wanna communicate with the gods.'

    EDIT: Any chance we're gonna see Aldrea and Dak Hamee in this continuity?

    Wonder if this is worth a try:

    1) Morph yeerk coelescion

    2) Split into shards

    3) Each shard gets morphing power from iscafil device and acquires members of the team
    Solution: Morph clones without need for sacrificing terminal patients

    Would Yeerk be necessary or can it be substituted with any animal that reproduces via binary fission like starfish, flatworm or earthworm?
    ```

    - u/TK17Studios:
      ```
      Note that they tried morphing Yeerks before and it didn't go well.

      But yes, if you could somehow get a Yeerk coalescion to agree to sacrifice itself (or just a small number of its shards) then you could go that route.
      ```

      - u/Ateo88:
        ```
        Thought it failed because they didn't know about coalescions back then though. They expected to morph a single yeerk slug. 

        Been a while since I read those chapters so apologies if I am getting details wrong!
        ```

        - u/death_au:

          I thought the same thing, too... But having it pointed out here also reminds me that morph constructs are controlled by Yeerk tissue. How can a bit of Yeerk tissue control another Yeerk/coalescion?
          ```

  - u/Ateo88:
    ```
    So I was combing through the chapters again to try and look for clues, and I found this:

    Chapter 50:

    > The creature chuckled, an unnervingly human sound.  “You misunderstand,” it said.  “Who am I speaking to right now—Aximili, or Perdão?  It’s not a question of black or white, good guys or bad guys, two distinct sets of pieces.  **All of the pieces are gray.  All belong equally to both players**, you no less than I.”

    Interlude 13:

    > But in the end, the bait had simply been too tempting to resist. The reunification of nearly all of the **adversary’s scattered pieces**—the Chee and the Animorphs and the new splinter coalescion—not to mention the further momentum toward cooperative symbiosis—

    So is this an inconsistency or something actually significant? Was Crayak (I assume) just referring to them as the adversary's pieces only because that was true at the time and not all the time? Or is it more like the Ellimist and Crayak have different 'playstyles' so to speak, and Ellimist sees 'all pieces belong to all players' whereas Crayak's mentality is more 'with-me-or-against-me'?
    ```

    - u/TK17Studios:
      ```
      It's a biiiiit of an inconsistency, in that if I ever go back and do a final cleanup edit I'll probably change the line in Interlude 13 to more readily match Chapter 50.

      But actually the avatar is doing a bit of "fallacy of the gray" there, and in fact all of the pieces can be manipulable by both parties and yet still given pieces can be favored by one god or the other.  The Animorphs are just as "touchable" by Crayak as they are by the Ellimist, but they're certainly more naturally "the Ellimist's pieces" just as the Howlers are more naturally "Crayak's."

  As promised, a longer review. Spoilers, of course. 




  First: I was surprised at how much progress they were able to make, when the Andalites (with much better weapons and more experienced morphers) and Yeerks (better weapons + ability to directly mind control large beasts) never made much progress into the mist. Conditional on them making it to the bottom, here are several rationalizations/explanations/possibilities, from least speculative to most:

  * Better morphs, in particular the bat morph. Earth's higher biodiversity might lead to faster/smaller/stronger morphs than what the Andalites have access to. Ax stated previously that the Tardigrade and mite morphs used by the animorphs are probably smaller than anything Andalites have morphed. In this case, the *kafit* bird was stated by Helium to be less impressive than Earth avians. It's most likely way less impressive than the bat morph used by Marco/Jake, and probably lacks echolocation (another important factor in their success). In fact, Marco 2^27 notices that the bat morph is faster than anything in the forest. The fact that they can use the bat morph to sneak up on beasts, demorph, and acquire probably explains a lot of their success (it let them acquire both the 'goyf and the Allosaurus.) **Cons**: That being said, it's unlikely that the gorilla morphs used for combat are more impressive than the combat morphs available to the Andalites, let alone Andalite military hardware. The Andalites probably had some way of seeing through the mist using sound as well. This combined with the fact that the animorphs could acquire the Churner *without* really using the maneuverability of the bat morph suggests that this can't be the only explanation.

  * Overt divine intervention. That is, Crayak or Ellimist are intervening directly in the mist to allow them to survive. For example, they were lucky to encounter the Churner first, before the Tarmogoyf, Scorpion, or Allosaurus. It's possible that the Andalite teams immediately encountered a 'goyf or similarly fearsome creature, and got TPK'ed before "leveling up". Marco 2^27 acquiring the 'goyf morph can be thought of a combination of divine intervention (by encountering it) and better morphs (my guess is that the bat was small enough to escape the 'goyf's attention and allow Marco to land on its back, demorph, and acquire it). **Cons**: Divine intervention explains everything sufficiently unlikely, and still leaves the question of how *exactly* the two gods intervened. 

  * Better combat doctrine. Perhaps by relying primarily on morphs instead of weapons, the Animorphs didn't draw as much attention as the Andalites/Yeerks did. In addition, I could see the Andalites favoring primarily frontal attacks, or Andalite military doctrine preventing suicide acquires. **Cons**: still, Andalites are a militaristic species, and had many more attempts to try to breach the mist. Even if the animorphs lucked into better tactics than the Andalites' first attempts, surely the Andalites would've eventually figured it out?

  * Andalite plague. The Arn developed a plague that wiped out half the Andalite fleet in the system. In the worst case, it might prevent Andalites from going through the forest at all. In the best case, it still greatly reduces their interest in going through the mist, as opposed to killing the Yeerk fleet and glassing the Arn civilization. **Cons**: Helium was able to be in Andalite form without obvious ill effects, so the disease is likely not present in the forest at this moment. That being said, I think a lack of interest in talking to the Arn (as opposed to killing all of them) may explain why the Andalites haven't been trying to breach the forest very hard.
  ```

  - u/TK17Studios:
    ```
    My intention was that it was a combination of the following:

    - Better morphs, indeed including the bat, which I wanted to showcase as the "keystone" of a strategy, since we don't have the storyline from canon where the bat is how they get into a high-tech facility to steal the Chee chip.  Things would have gone much worse without the bat.

    - Different morphing *philosophy.*  Note that the Andalites have only had morphing power for a couple more years than the humans, and also use it much less centrally; to them, it's mostly something used for infiltration and espionage rather than for overpowering the enemy.  It would not occur to many non-Alloran Andalites, for instance, to even *try* working their way up the chain, acquiring larger and larger monsters one by one.  A squad of Andalites would be much more likely to go forward in their own bodies, attempting to simply shoot down the monsters, until eventually they made so much noise that they attracted a critical mass and were slaughtered.  They also would have been less likely to have the key insight that Marco had, to weaponize the acquiring trance; note that the Animorphs were on track to *lose* that first big battle until the two human Marcos made the sacrifice play.

    - Less intervention from the Arn.  Though it's not explicitly written out in this book, the Arn here have the same sort of pseudo-control over the monsters that they had in canon; once it becomes clear that people are trying to breach the mist, the Arn crank up surveillance and orchestration of the monsters, making them more like a police force and less like a random murdercloud.  In this case, there's no current active large-scale conflict, so the Arn aren't watching closely, and the Animorphs weren't making a ton of noise/disturbance, so they didn't get noticed.

    Note also that the Animorphs had penetrating the mist as a *specific goal*.  During the Yeerk/Andalite war, the primary valued territory was the treetop villages (and eventually, at the very end, the canyon walls).  That makes it worthwhile to *try* sneaking through the mist, along the lines of "if we can approach unnoticed, that'll give us an edge in this battle."  But once you discover that there is an extremely high cost to trying to sneak through the mist, and once your first, second, and third attempts to do it differently have all met with disaster, it's reasonable for many generals to just shrug and say "that's not really part of the map of this conflict; There Be Dragons."  If neither side seems to be attempting to exploit the mist territory, then there's no arms-race pressure to be the group that figures it out.  Again, Alloran and similar other 99th-percentile military minds (Marco, Ender Wiggin) would've probably kept at it anyway, expecting the payoff to be worth the investment in the end, but in this case Alloran (as Esplin's slave) was on the side that was already winning, and so didn't bother.

      Ah. Didn't Jake use it against the howlers in Canon? But yes, I doubt that Andalites would've tried using the acquiring trance that way. 

      Re: not penetrating the mist. Wouldn't Elfangor figure it out too? And he was there. Was there some reason he didn't try, especially after the Yeerks started defending open the canyon center (and thus necessitating a way to breach the mist to attack the Arn)?  

      Well, I got 2/3 recall and 2/4 precision, which isn't too bad I guess. ;)

        Elfangor wasn't a major player in that war (I don't know if I'll be able to make the timeline clearer on that; there are reasons not to derail the story too far into historical events).  He was there briefly, on a special mission unrelated to the main campaign, and also just flew straight to the canyon.  And by the time his mission concluded, the biowarfare had started to create casualties.

        But yeah, in the worlds where he was a part of the campaign long-term, he would have thought of it.

      - u/daytodave:

        It's probably worth noting that the Tarmogoyf has been spotted 7 times, and even escaped once. So the kids have at best only tied the Andalites so far, and they're only likely to survive because of the bat morph.
        ```

    - u/FireNexus:
      ```
      That’s what I was thinking. The Arn set up the murder cloud to just run itself and get most of what might go through, but will take it over and fuck everyone’s day up if things start looking weird. The animorph incursion, to them, just looks like the normal amount of chaos. 

      I wonder if the arn kicking on their control will create problems if somebody is in one of their morphs, though...
      ```

  - u/AstralCodex:
    ```
    Second: Kudos on using the Tarmogoyf as one of the scariest monsters in the Arn death forest. I thought it seemed out of place, but it makes sense after more reflection. 

    Despite playing a lot of Magic, especially Modern (and thus facing a lot of Tarmogoyfs), I never did register how large a 'goyf could be. One part of this is the [Future Sight art](https://external-preview.redd.it/Is_J4AfnLYwrt3Rvix3raQTkeFwFmZ03W52JY2Cbxeg.jpg?auto=webp&s=0ef45241cffe429055136cf2e36ad2f2e596b559), which makes it look much smaller than the [Modern Masters's art](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/wallpaper/wallpaper-week-tarmogoyf-2013-06-19), which your 'goyf is based on. 

    But it makes sense, a Goyf can easily be a 6/7 in normal game play, and maxes out as a 8/9. Dragons are 5/5-7/7s, and the larger Dinosaurs are in the same range as well. From DnD and the like, dragons could easily be 25+ meters long, as are the largest dionsaurs in reality. So a monster able to win against a dragon or dinosaur through sheer brute force could easily be larger than 25 meters. The Modern Masters art makes the 'goyf look about 30-40 meters long, based on the deer. Godzilla was 50 meters tall in the original 1954 film, so a 30-40 meter long 'goyf could easily "might have a chance vs Godzilla". 

    Interesting, this iteration of the 'goyf was designed primarily by Ryan Berger (the artist commissioned to do the reprint Art) and not the Magic team. Here's the art description, which is vague as to the actual look of the 'goyf:

    > Color: Green creature

    > Location: Ancient coniferous forest, touches of snow

    > Action: We see a huge pile of debris atop a hill in the forest—rich loam, broken and rusted armor pieces, and countless bones amid the black dirt. From the debris heap bursts a massive monster that feeds on death. It’s yours to design, but it should have a grey-brown hide maybe mottled with green or beige, an enormous set of jaws, and huge hands that can scoop up chunks of food, living or dead.

    > Focus: The ancient and terrible creature

    > Mood: A devouring monstrosity

    Given where they are though, it's a pity that this morph is vulnerable to being [pushed off a cliff](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/562e2633e4b0b7066d01cbfa/1484058141496-7GJVABYY8EDF6J6UATSI/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kMzSg5MPsPopGNhO9hESjlcUqsxRUqqbr1mOJYKfIPR7LoDQ9mXPOjoJoqy81S2I8N_N4V1vUb5AoIIIbLZhVYxCRW4BPu10St3TBAUQYVKcWyJxmU_NBNSu0D06g18vUH1lc4wneOYq5_T5VkXXL3eToKGEASmf0sT4Mx9X1mef/400294-Fatal+Push.jpg?format=750w). ;)

  Hmmm, I can't really agree with this on an instinctual level. To me the "first-person experience" is all there is to life. A lot of people seem to consider that to leave behind a legacy is to continue to exist in some abstract sense. Am I in the minority to feel that this isn't true? It's pretty interesting, quite a bit of fiction like Westworld and Soma deal with this as well.
  ```

  - u/TK17Studios:
    ```
    You're in the majority, as far as I can tell, re: putting a heavy, heavy emphasis on the first-person experience; this is the belief behind (for instance) not wanting to take a Star Trek teleporter, or be uploaded into a computer, or even have gradual neuron transplant.  Some people are willing to accept moving their software to a new machine (either biological or mechanical) as long as there's no interruption of consciousness, but most people identify an exact-down-to-the-molecule clone of them as *definitely not them.*

    I do think that a lot of people *comfort* themselves with the idea of a legacy?  Like, I don't think there are many that would trade away first-person life-years for guaranteed legacy, or at least not without a pretty steep rate of exchange.  But I think you're still in the majority there, too—I imagine you'd prefer a legacy to no legacy, but would prefer life-without-legacy to less-life-with-legacy?

    Marco, in this chapter, holds my own personal view, which has two main parts:

    1) The most important defining aspect of one's identity is one's *filter-nature* ... what experiences you value, what things you would change about the world around you, what you would create, what you would destroy—the algorithm by which you, earthworm-like, filter universe through yourself and convert it into universe-prime.

    2) Anything that would filter universe in the exact same way as you *is* you; any copy of you running on any hardware is still you; as long as at least one copy is extant and actively filtering, you're still alive.  If I could, with confidence, push a button to create an exact clone of me, identical in every way except he had uninjured knees, at the cost of dropping dead, I'd do it.  I imagine that *in the moment* I'd have significantly greater hesitation than I do when it's just a thought experiment, but it's central enough to my life philosophy that I expect I'd push through anyway, lest I abandon that very philosophy.
    ```

      What if I do not change anything about the world around me? If I choose to exist-just-to-exist? I'd understand if people told me "Look, son, if you don't make anything out of your life, you'd be nobody." But that's being 'nobody' in a very abstract sense. As long as I can continue to perceive things, I'd be 'somebody'.  Only when I stop perceiving things, I'd be 'nobody'.

      I wonder if a more literal-minded thinker like Garret would hold the opposite view? Like he would have trouble considering clones of him to be 'him' even if they all made decisions the same way, or held the same values, or did everything the way he would.

      Another thing: what experiences I value and what I would choose to create or destroy, these things can change over time, right? It's the reason why people can say "I was a different person back then." But you're not really a different person, except in a very abstract metaphorical sense. You're still the same person. It doesn't mean that if your values change, you are no longer 'you' does it?

      In hindsight, I think it was dealt with a little in that V3 chapter, but I'm not entirely sure... But I wonder if V3 is also pursuing first-person immortality?

      EDIT:
      >I imagine you'd prefer a legacy to no legacy, but would prefer life-without-legacy to less-life-with-legacy?

      I guess I wouldn't really have a preference as to whether I have a legacy or not because if I'm no longer around to perceive it then it wouldn't matter at all.

      EDIT 2:
      >  or even have gradual neuron transplant. Some people are willing to accept moving their software to a new machine (either biological or mechanical) as long as there's no interruption of consciousness,

      these methods - where your old organic 'parts' are gradually swapped out and replaced with more durable parts - are in my opinion the only 'true' immortality because your first person perspective is preserved even if you have none of your original parts left.

        Garrett's already on record in this fic trying to convince Tobias to do morph-death-regeneration in order to fix his amputated hand.  He's also on record thinking it would be *much* better if both he and Tobias had multiple redundant clones.

        Even if you're not changing the world around you, you're exercising preferences within it; the planet Thanos chose to retire on tells us a lot about what Thanos thinks is beautiful and rejuvenating, and if he had chosen a different world he would've been meaningfully a different person.

        > Another thing: what experiences I value and what I would choose to create or destroy, these things can change over time, right? It's the reason why people can say "I was a different person back then." But you're not really a different person, except in a very abstract metaphorical sense. You're still the same person.

        Personally, I am *horrified* by people saying 'eh, I was a different person back then;' it seems akin to self-murder or personality erasure; if your future self is one day going to dismiss your present self utterly with a casual wave, then how can you even "know who you are" in any significant or enduring sense?  

        I note that if you enjoy questions like this, you should look forward to the Rachel chapter, upcoming in four weeks, with some amount of excitement.  In particular, there's discussion of the distinction between identifying with your "sculpture" (the personality traits you currently exhibit) and identifying with your "sculptor" (the thing that decides which changes would be positive versus which changes would be negative).

          You’re a meaningfully different person every few years until at least your 30s, and possibly right up until forever if you live that long. You’re a natural progression of who you were five years ago, but you’re not the same guy. And future you is going to be a different guy all together as well.

          That’s just the nature of what we are. There never was a consistent self.  So... you can’t “know who you are” in any enduring because there is no enduring “who you are”. Your horror at it feels a bit like the neurotic existential terror the Visser feels about his identity, when he’d be better off thinking of himself as what he is.

        So is sleep death? It involves an interruption of the first-person perspective that is then later resumed. How is that different from, say, uploading into a computer (assuming a lossless upload)?

However, let's say something goes wrong, that during the swap I lose consciousness forever and never wake up, and a new consciousness that retrieves my memories and personality data starts to inhabit my body. Even though to an outside observer there is no difference, if my body eats a burrito but I don't taste it, I would have 'died'. This is also why Helium calls himself that instead of Ax isn't it?

    Tobias woke up (naturally) and they decided to find volunteers to resurrect Marco, Jake, Rachel, and Garrett.

    Marco was the first of the resurrected to wake up, and almost immediately began sneaking off with the cube to make clones.  It was something he'd already considered even before the disaster, but once the line had already been crossed, he had basically no compunctions.

    So the time in which clones were being made:

     - Before the Jake-waking-up chapter
     - During the Tobias chapter
     - In the gap between the Tobias chapter and the Ax-waking-up chapter

    ... which is a span of something like 4-6 weeks; I don't have the timeline notes right in front of me.  Enough time for him to make about 30 clones and for about a third of those to wake up.

    (Remember that he can try convincing people in batches, i.e. an entire Hospice home at once.)
    ```

    - u/Mowtom_:
      ```
      Oh wait ok, I forgot that there must have been a several week span skipped over last chapter so that Ax could wake up naturally.  Got it.

      ...so Ax woke up significantly faster than Rachel or Garrett did?
      ```

      - u/TK17Studios:
        ```
        Yeah.  I'm going with Andalites would wake up faster on average than humans, but also note that some of the humans woke up within a week and others are still comatose 6-8 weeks later.
        ```

        - u/FireNexus:
          ```
          It’s weird that there seems to be such variation in what is effectively identical bodies. I think you need a mechanism for that. There is just no reason that two Marcos should not take exactly the same amount of time to wake up, or just both die if they’re going to. 

          If it’s an immune process, they have nearly identical immune systems. The yeerk harness should be more or less identical, and they’re physically very close if not identical. I just find it weird.
          ```

          - u/TK17Studios:
            ```
            Think about a pair of identical logs rotting side by side in near identical environments.  It's true that they will take almost exactly the same amount of time to rot totally away (same 'half-life,' if you will), but they'll rot in different *spots* first.  Different parts of the log will disappear, and with Yeerk-flesh blocking various neural pathways, different rot-patterns lead to wildly different wakeup times.
            ```

  I’m not sure I ever understood how morph cloning works. It’s certainly a divergence from canon. Could anybody explain it to me step by step?

  (Same question for Jake’s death and resurrection, but I’d settle for a chapter number for that one.)
  ```

  - u/notgreat:
    ```
    1. Morphers can acquire animals. Humans and other sapient species are not excepted. They morph specific beings, not just the species.
    2. As an example: Bob acquires Alice, then morphs into her (Bob->Alice). Alice cuts her nails, becomes Alice'. Alice' acquires Bob->Alice. Alice' can now morph into Alice'->Bob->Alice, effectively regaining her lost nails. This is called "Morph Armor", where a person morphs into a past version of themself.
    3. Morphing into an animal gives you their instincts/reflexes. This is implemented by copying the brain (except short-term memories), and then applying modified Yeerk tissue with a Z-space link to the morpher's emulated brain. The full brain and thus personality of that being is still there, just controlled by the Yeerk-tissue (which is controlled by the morpher). It is normally unconscious but can be "turned on" by the morpher.
    4. When morphing, a morpher's original body is placed in stasis in a Z-space pocket dimension. This pocket dimension is unstable, and will collapse after ~2 hours (dependent on the mass stored in it- small beings can morph longer). When the collapse happens, the Yeerk tissue remains and the morphed entity is placed in a coma. Eventually the Yeerk tissue dies (possibly from kandrona deprivation? Lasts longer than usual since it isn't doing much) or is removed by the chee, leaving behind a clone of the morph.

    Having written all this out I do wonder why a morpher can't turn on the morph's consciousness and then let the time limit expire, skipping the coma step. Presumably the Yeerk tissue automatically reverts to controlling when not being explicitly made to give the controlled being autonomy?

    Jake's death: The true body was irreparably injured so Jake morphed into a morph-armor of himself and let the timer expire, leaving behind an older Jake (plus Yeerk tissue that had to be cleared)

    If the kandrona deprivation hypothesis is correct than any human morphs acquired post-modification won't have the tissue degrade and thus won't leave the coma naturally.
    ```

    - u/TK17Studios:
      ```
      Endorsed; the key differences from canon are:

      1) you can acquire from someone who's morphed (i.e. You Don't All Have To Touch The Fucking Tiger)

      2) when you stay past the time limit, the "real you" out in Z-space vanishes, and all that's left is the morphed body

      So if somebody stays past the limit while morphed into a copy of you, poof—you now have a copy of you.

      > Presumably the Yeerk tissue automatically reverts to controlling when not being explicitly made to give the controlled being autonomy?

      Yes.  Or not even "controlling" so much as it's just there, in the way, not letting any signals through.

      > If the kandrona deprivation hypothesis is correct than any human morphs acquired post-modification won't have the tissue degrade and thus won't leave the coma naturally.

      This is a good catch, but it's not true, actually; the morphing tech artificial Yeerk-flesh doesn't actually have a fully functioning metabolism, so it'll still die even though there's Kandrona available.  It's got enough to function for a few hours, and then that's it.  That's not information that has been clarified in the text.
      ```

      - u/daytodave:
        ```
        > It's got enough to function for a few hours, and then that's it.

        Does that put a hard limit on how long you can stay in morph, even if your natural body is tiny?
        ```

        - u/TK17Studios:
          ```
          More like a soft limit than a hard one, because we're still talking biology and it's not super consistent, but yes—they were excited about a Yeerk being able to stay in morph for days'n'days and actually it wouldn't have worked out that well.

          Two constraints are involved.  The first is the power needed to maintain a pocket dimension, and that almost always masks the second, which is the longevity of the biological machine here in realspace.  But if you remove the first constraint you'll hit the second.
          ```

    - u/earnestadmission:
      ```
      This explanation implies a few things I didn’t catch (or at least didn’t remember).
      1:Morphers can acquire genetic information from someone who is in morph. Alice’ acquires Alice from Bob (who has morphed).

      2:After the Yeerk tissue is removed, morph armor is able to morph again after waking up from the coma. 

      Q2:does this require exposure to the Escafil device again?

      3:The yeerk tissue is physically inside a person wearing morph armor. I thought that was just a metaphor. 

      4:Jake morphed into a physical copy of himself, without injuries *or the memories since his last backup*. 


      This means that Marco’s clones were people that were exposed to the escafil device, morphed into Marco, waited for the time limit to expire, and then later emerged from a coma. 

      The constraint is that the Cube had to be present for each new Marco, right?
      ```

      - u/notgreat:
        ```
        Q2- The clone cannot naturally morph. Marco was able to grant morphing power to his clones while they were still in a coma with the Escafil device. His process was as follows:

        1. Get consent from a cancer patient. Grant the cancer patient morphing power with the device
        2. Have them morph into him. Wait for the pocket dimension collapse. He now has a clone of himself in a coma.
        3. Grant the coma clone morphing power with the device.
        4. Eventually the clone wakes up and is now a fully autonomous morph-capable Marco-clone.

        I do wonder what happens if he tries to do step 3 before step 2. Probably just fails to grant the power, but if nested morphing works then who knows.
        ```

        - u/TK17Studios:
          ```
          You missed step 1.5, which is:

          Give the cancer patient one afternoon to fly free in bird morph, or run on the beach in dog morph, before coming back to give up their body for the cause.

          (This was never specified in text but is 1000% canon.)
          ```

          - u/notgreat:
            ```
            I think that was mentioned for Jake's clone source, so it makes sense that Marco did that for everyone.

            I wonder if any of the cancer patients just flew away? They won't last forever, but they can just cycle between morphs and only spend a few minutes per day in their original body (sleeping sucks though, they'd need to wake up every hour or so to remorph)

            I suppose the cancer patients don't know that (and the ones who would think of it wouldn't be selected by Marco anyway) but it still seems like quite the risk. They'd just be more recruits that way I guess so no big deal I suppose.

          My theory is that this is possible, but if your morph body A tried to morph into body B: Body A could no longer receive signals from your real body in stasis, and body B would just be in a coma for the duration.  And then you'll die without being able to bring your real body out of stasis.

              >“It’s the mass,” I said, paraphrasing the theory that THÀN had come up with after the BROADCAST. “When you morph something smaller or bigger than you. It has to come from somewhere, and it would take a ridiculous amount of energy to just create it. It’s got to be being teleported in from Z-space.”

              >“From Z-space, or through Z-space?” asked OFFICER FARLOW.

              So, not certainly known, but IMO the mass is much less of a question than the acquisition and brain emulation components. Once you figure out how that stuff is set up, the mass question is almost certainly answered at the same time.

  Really awesome chapter! I've noticed that (unsurprisingly) the Marco clones have made each death feel pretty unemotional, compared to eg Cassie's death scene, though I guess this was pretty unavoidable. And I'm really enjoying the stronger transhumanist themes, and seeing Marco actually live the mindset that a clone of me is another me, and choosing to cooperate with it!

  >"Nah," the other Marco said. His face was pale in the twilight, and growing paler by the minute. "Don't want—fuck with the objectives."

  I'm quite confused by the long Marco death scene, it seems strictly better to have gone into a useful morph to get at least 2 hours of extra use out of him. My best guess for what the quote meant was that he expected this to be net distracting, because Jake would prioritise healing him later rather than the more important mission? But this doesn't feel that compelling, there ought to be a better alternative like injured Marco committing suicide at the end of the morph, or otherwise convincing Jake to give up on him.
  ```

  - u/TK17Studios:
    ```
    "Strictly better" is such a tricky term.

    Would it have been better to have an additional large and powerful body for a few more hours?

    Absolutely.

    I'd also expect a Marclone (of all people) to be able to function coherently for two hours even knowing that he would die at the end.

    But there are a bunch of other considerations (mostly interpersonal/emotional, as you guessed) in the mix.

    My read on Marco is that he's a satisficer, not an optimizer.  He takes the first viable option "above the bar" ... he doesn't wait for the perfect thing unless perfection *is* the bar.

    And wounded, dying, thinking about Jake's emotional state, thinking about his *own* state/happiness/desires, thinking about the fact that they're already arranged for the kind of death scene that we've been programmed by a thousand books and movies to expect to play out in a certain way—

    If Marco were a perfect "Spock" straw rationalist, he'd shrug it off and hop back up for two more hours of duty before dying.

    But he's a (brilliant, but still only) 14 year old kid, and he looked around at the rest of the clones, and it was enough for him to feel like they would make it, that his own contribution probably wouldn't make the difference between Jake living and Jake dying, and he was tired, and he was frightened, and he was trying to keep his best friend from freaking out, and he wanted a kiss before he said goodbye forever, and ultimately ...

    He chose a graceful exit, over other important goals.  I think this is defensible, though I agree you could argue for something more coldly utilitarian.

    I don't think Crayak gave V3 the Howlers (just) as shock troops; how much could he actually do with them that he couldn't accomplish with gas, bioweapons, and heavily armored Hork-Bajir?

    In canon the Howlers have (apparently) infinite range telepathy, in the form of a collective memory that propagates so quickly that Crayak Itself couldn't react fast enough to kill off seven of them before Jake's memories corrupted the entire species. I think r!Crayak's actual plan was to hand r!V3 a shortcut to his goal of omnipresence/omniscience.

    That said, acquiring the 'goyf is a pretty big win for the animorphs and therefore the Ellimist. Makes you wonder what Crayak's getting out of this field trip.
