## [D][Q] Portable Holes, Klein bottles, extradimensional spaces, and exploding heads

### Post:

One of the readers of [2YE](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9669819/1/The-Two-Year-Emperor) was asking me about teleporting into Portable Holes, and  it made me think of the '[Munchkin this nickel](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2ib7ua/dmkmunchkin_this_nickel/)' thread, so I figured I'd post it here.

How badly could you munchkin a Portable Hole in the real world?  The Hole works as described below, but all other technology and physics are the same.

Points of definition:

* A [Portable Hole](http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Portable_Hole) is a magical piece of black silk cloth.  You can pick it up, fold it, cut it (which destroys the magic), put it in your pocket, etc.  
* When you lay it flat on any surface (wall, floor, ceiling, a blanket, whatever) it creates an opening to an extradimensional space 6' in diameter and 10' deep.  For the sake of discussion, let's identify the sides as Top (where the mouth of the hole is), Bottom (the flat side opposite the mouth), North, South, East, and West (the curved sides of the cylinder).
* The gravity inside the Hole INSTANTLY aligns itself to the outside world when the entrance opens.  If you open it on the ground, it's a pit and gravity goes towards Bottom.  If you open it on the wall, it's a dead-end tunnel and gravity goes towards N,S,E, or W, depending.  Open it on the ceiling and gravity goes down, out the Top.  If you put it on a wall so that the gravity aligns North, then take it off the wall, rotate it 90 degrees clockwise and put it back up, then the  gravity is now aligned to point East.  (West is the new upper side.)  When it opens, things fall based on the new gravity orientation.
* When the Hole is open, it's just like any other hole -- mass inside it exerts a gravitational pull on the outside world, if the surface that it's on turns the gravity in the Hole remains aligned with the outside and anything inside it gets tumbled around just as you'd expect.
* You can pick the cloth up from the outside and the Hole closes.  Anyone in the Hole can't get out because the opening is gone.
* You can pick the cloth up from the INside and the Hole closes, but you have the cloth.  When you put the cloth flat (on the ceiling / floor / wall of the Hole) the opening will reappear.
* The extradimensional space is always there, it's just that you can only walk in / out of it when it's open.
* There is a magic spell that will allow you and everything that you're carrying to teleport into or out of the Hole regardless of whether it's open or closed.

Other items gathered from the comments:

* When the Hole is closed, the mass inside is completely disconnected from the outside universe.
* The walls/floor are absolutely indestructible, since they are the outer boundaries of a universe.
* They are always at a comfortable temperature (20C), but any outside thermal energy that contacts them simply vanishes.
* They work like a Middle Ages wizard who didn't know much about physics would expect them to: if you drop something, it behaves as though you dropped it on a tile floor. Rubber balls bounce, then eventually stop. Beanbags just lie there. If you punch it, you hurt your knuckles and the walls are totally unaffected -- they do not distort at all, much less break.
* When the Hole is open, the cloth vanishes, leaving the portal in its place.  If you grab the edge of the Hole and pull, the cloth will reappear in your hand and the portal will vanish.
* If something is sticking out the top, you can't close the Hole.

  What happens if you retract the hole from the inside, then destroy whatever the outside portal was on?

    Undefined.  I could see the following options:

    * The Hole is now inaccessible (can't be reopened from inside or out)
    * That when you open it it will open on the nearest flat surface.  (And yes, that would imply instantaneous movement.)    
    * That it will create a copy of the surface it was on.  (This one makes the least sense in my mind but this is all just a thought experiment.)

    Choose which one you like, or try scenarios for all of them.

  If the mass of anything inside the hole is disconnected from the universe outside when the hole is closed, it should be possible to use the hole to both generate power and also as an inertial drive.

  Inertial drive: You have a large, powerful, piston capable of rapid movement. Steam train stuff. On one end, you bolt it to whatever you want moved. On the other end, it butts up against the entrance to the hole, and also wraps around to a plate on the back side of the hole - the hole is placed on the plate.

  The piston is retracted. The hole is opened. It contains a very heavy mass, which the unbolted piston end is now pressed against. The piston is extended and pushes against the mass, moving the mass away from the bolted end of the piston, and a reciprocal force is applied to the bolted end, pushing whatever it's bolted to.

  The hole is then closed, the piston retracts again with its now-much-lighter load, and the cycle repeats.
  ```

    That is very cool.  You'd need an armature that lifted the cloth off the plate / put it back on in order to close / open it, but that's a pretty small addition to what you're describing.

  Space launch - stick a series of nested holes on a small, cheap launch vehicle, get it into space, then pop everything out of the holes. You could have arbitrarily large structures.
  ```

  ```
  Launch mechanism:

  Hole gravity goes out the top. Place object-to-be-launched inside hole, held in place by pins just outside the hole. When the pins are released, the object will fall real-world-up, out of the hole.

  Place hole on linear accelerator. When hole is at the appropriate position in the linear accelerator, release the pins. Object falls out of the hole and is now traveling at the speed of the hole plus the speed from falling 10 feet*. Stop the hole. 

  Cheaper / easier / more reusable then hiding launch mass inside the hole and simply using a rocket.

  * For vertical launches, this is actually a slight loss, not a gain, due to air resistance, and so you need to give the object a little extra push to clear the hole's horizon.
