  ```
  Did the Augur imply that Bard was a fae or some sort of fae-like creature that has outstayed her summon, or was the whole talk of fingerbones and twine some abstract metaphor.
  ```

  - u/ATRDCI:
    ```
    No.  The Mavii summoning very much applies as a pretty direct metaphor for how Agnes drew Bard in and then keep her distracted while the slight alterations Agnes made to her plan took place.

    &nbsp;

    But Bard isn't fae so much as basically having to come when being explicitly summoned no matter the method.  Remember that she came when the Sisters were making their call/plea to the Gods Below and that certainly had nothing to do with fae.
    ```

      Augur definitely seems to have changed things, but I'm very unclear on how exactly. Was Bard supposed to be elsewhere, but was held up by Agnes's rambling? The Name of Augur is more about knowing than about acting on the knowledge, I thought. Did she give instructions to cause something to play out, a la Contessa from Worm?
      ```

      - u/GeeJo:
        ```
        She set up the burnings in the previous chapters, probably by arranging the goblinfire to get into the city:

        > “Sometimes there is a need for bleeding,” the Augur said, looking up at the horizon.

        > Plumes of smoke had begun to rise, for Salia was burning. She would ask the Gods to forgive her, but she sought no absolution.

        > Let her silence drag her all the way to the Hells, if it was what she deserved.

        Those burnings made the White Knight and the Witch of the West accelerate their 'Judgments'. In particular, the Witch raised and crashed a manse in the previous chapter because of the already-present chaos:

        > Before Simon could ask where the First Prince had then gone, genuinely bemused, both of them turned when soldiers in the courtyard began to yell in surprise. The lay brother swallowed drily, when he saw what appeared to be an entire manse rise high in the night sky before being suddenly smashed downwards to a chorus of screams.

        > That, Simon of Gorgeault thought, rather changed things.

        That demonstration of power led Brother Simon and Prince Renato to set out earlier than expected. They'd planned to go with a full guard, but instead left with just a few horsemen.

        > Prince Renato brought only a small escort when they sallied out, all mounted, and provided a mount for Simon as well. There was no point in bringing great strength, for they’d seen rise in the sky how such would be answered. No, best to flee if things went badly and for that horses and few soldiers were best.

        This lets them meet the White Knight and the Witch of the West on the road, which brings Hanno to the Court just before Cordelia is forced to assume a Name to defend herself. Hanno even says himself that they were meant to meet:

        > “We are here for a reason, Antigone,” the Ashuran said, almost chidingly. “To meet them, perhaps. Do you know where the First Prince is being held?”

        > ...

        > “Then you must help us,” Brother Simon says. “For my colleagues will have gathered every sword they can from the city guard and the garrison, every loyal man and woman in the city, but even with the help of loyal princes and the retinues we will find it hard to take the palace.”

        > “See?” the White Knight smiled, glancing at his comrade. “Always a reason.”

        Everything that happened was expected to happen. Thanks to the Augur, it just happened a little earlier.
        ```

        - u/rabotat:
          ```
          good eye
          ```

      - u/MimicSquid:
        ```
        She might have kept the Bard from interfering with the White Knight's arrival to save the day.
        ```

        - u/Oaden:
          ```
          The crux is that due to the Augur's scheme, the White Knight arrived earlier, about 30 seconds or so, just before he entered, Cordelia almost named herself Warden of the West, which would have ended the conspiracy by force, but also end the principate of Procer

          So Cordelia would have been fine either way, but in one scenario she is forced to take a name, in the other, she is offered two, the Warden, and a name of below, but is able to turn down both because her life is no longer in danger.
          ```

  - u/vimefer:
    ```
    I don't think Bard is fey, as she's above Stories and not within, and can shape them as they unfold instead of being constrained by them.
    ```

- u/MadMax0526:
  ```
  Well well, the revelations and surprises keep on coming.

  The Augur is actually against the Bard. Cordelia rejects a Name with extreme prejudice, and tells Judgement to go blow a nut, and avoids the siren call of becoming a dictator at the last minute, when the story seemed to be shaping up to have her fall.
  ```

  - u/Oshi105:
    ```
    Cordelia rejects two names thank you very much.
    ```

    - u/bubby_cat2:
      ```
      Warden of the West, which would have been Justice's Name...
      was the second some kind of Empress?

      Maybe the Only Law?
      ```

      - u/PastafarianGames:
        ```
        I'm pretty sure the other Name would have been First Prince.
        ```

        - u/Nimelennar:
          ```
          I don't think so; there have been a lot of un-Named First Princes in Procer.  The Name doesn't carry Cordelia's story very well.

          My guess would have been exactly the Name the conspiracy accused her of wanting: Queen, probably with some sort of adjective before it (Vengeful Queen?).
          ```

          - u/Amagineer:
            ```
            In the paragraph where she's offered the second name, she's referred to as the First Prince, until she rejects it. After rejecting it, she is Cordelia.

            > She could be the law, the **First Prince** knew. After this, looking in the eyes of those around her, seeing the loyalty that was blooming there. The faith. She could take it, and **First Prince** or not she would be the only law Procer would need. With scheme and knife, with ruthless will, she could purge the rot and turn Procer into what it should be instead of… this. No, **Cordelia** thought once more, and this time it was barely a struggle at all.
            ```

          - u/asdfion:
            ```
            First Prince explicitly wasn't a name ever in history, just a title. This could have made it one.

            ```

            - u/Nimelennar:
              ```
              That's what I mean.

              If you look at the royalty of Callow, "King/Queen of Callow" isn't a Name, despite having several Named people on the throne.  Each of those Named rulers have some other distinction: Queen of Blades (Elizabeth Alban), or the Good King (Jehan Fairfax).

              First Prince is just the title of the ruler of Procer.  It seems too *common*, too *usual* to be a Name.

              Besides, she would have been taking upon herself power that the First Prince doesn't have: if the other princes think that appointing a few partisans is enough to accuse her of crowning herself a Queen, how wouldn't reforming the whole country in her image be?
              ```

        - u/Oaden:
          ```
          The relevant excerpt is 

          >She could be the law, the First Prince knew. After this, looking in the eyes of those around her, seeing the loyalty that was blooming there. The faith. She could take it, and First Prince or not she would be the only law Procer would need. With scheme and knife, with ruthless will, she could purge the rot and turn Procer into what it should be instead of… this. No

          First Prince doesn't fit cause it kind of explicitly says "First prince or no" meaning even if she wasn't first prince, the name would still work, rather someone that brutally destroys the corrupt and purges weakness, with a strong dash of nationalism. Maybe Inquisitor or Judge or something
          ```

  - u/JanusTheDoorman:
    ```
    Eh, I don't think she was against the Bard as much as simply acting for Cordelia and making sure she didn't end up a pawn in the Bard's game against Cat and the Dead King.
    ```

    - u/MadMax0526:
      ```
      >simply acting for Cordelia and making sure she didn't end up a pawn in the Bard's game

      The two are not dissimilar at this point. And she just ensured that the only Named rulers Bard can interact with are Kairos and Malicia, which promises to be... fun. And.this insulates the Principate on the highest level from her machinations.
      ```

      - u/panchoadrenalina:
        ```
        the bard can still talk to cat if she gives her an opening and spite losing his right to rule the grey pilgrim is still the *primus inter pares* of the heroes she has a lot of  room to scheme yet
        ```

        - u/MadMax0526:
          ```
          >she has a lot of room to scheme yet.

          I don't disagree, but at this point, she can't afford for ANY of the schemes to come out in the open. GP may take anything she does or says as being done for the Greater Good, but if any one of her schemes come to light, that is as good as isolating the heroes from the few remaining sources of support they have and risks turning Pilgrim from a supporter to a staunch opponent.

          GP is first among equals, but at this point the only broad source of support (with trust) is in the Dominion. Praes hates him along with other heroes, th League is licking their chops at the chance of whacking the heroes through Heirarch. He pissed of Cat, so Callow is out. Cordelia isn't too keen on Heroes, when they slipped the leash and interfered in foreign policy, and when news of the plague came to light. And if it becomes known that Bard set up the whole shitty situation in Salia, the consequences would be... interesting.

          So, unless Bard can get GP to have all the Heroes go rogue, with their own agenda, her scheming will have limited effect. If she can manage that, the political support for the heroes will dry up from both the Good kingdoms and the Evil ones like whisky on the sun. That kind of results in the same thing.

          I might turn out to be hopelessly wrong, but that's my current read on the situation, and I stand by it.
          ```

    - u/Halinn:
      ```
      A big assumption that the Bard only has one game going on in the region. The Dead King might be the biggest, but there's an after that needs shaping too
      ```

      - u/JanusTheDoorman:
        ```
        My current working hypothesis is that Bard's main prerogative is to prevent the apotheosis of any greater gods. Sve Noc and the heads of Fae Courts are approximately lesser gods but the Dead King seems to be pushing into the medium territory, and Cat seems to be making a habit of killing/manipulating entities in those categories so the Bard's got an eye on her.

        She doesn't seem to particularly care about anything short of deity-making, no I'm not sure how much of the after she really cares about shaping if it introduces any risk at all to the current game. Granted, this is largely informed by her conversation with Cat that was at least partly motivated by trying to get Cat to act a bit more typical villain-y so that Pilgrim/other heroes would end up killing her, but it's also taking into account the Dead King's own fixation on apotheosis/immortality as being the only events worth considering and his view of the Bard as a player on that scale.
        ```

        - u/Halinn:
          ```
          Setting the stage for stagnation is better prevention than shutting down anyone that gets too close. Especially when the Bard can only act indirectly, which makes it difficult to stop someone moving fast.
          ```

- u/kmucha31:
  ```
  I love watching the Bard get played.

  ```
  Amazing chapter, Cordelia is a tank.

- u/Academic_Jellyfish:
  ```
  >“They always make the same choices,” the Bard said. “You’ll learn.”

  Didn't she once say...
  >“We must seem like golems to you,” the man said wonderingly. “Our incantations written by the hands of Gods instead of men, yet not so different peering down from your perch. Eyeless things toiling for purpose we cannot understand.”

  >“One day, maybe,” she said. “When I will have grown used to dying. Until then I still weep for what we do to ourselves, without needing a single nudge.”

  I guess she's not so nice anymore.
