  Weell so I don't remember who it was that hypothesized that every power would have some sort of symmetric version but there seems to be something like that going on here.

  Ooooh, boy. I have been looking forward to posting this chapter for a while now. It's a big one, too, clocking in at just under 2,600 words. I can't promise when we're going to get another one like that, but we are definitely moving in the direction of longer chapters, even if an occasional one is shorter than usual. 

  As always, I'm delighted to hear your feedback, even/especially if you think there's a problem somewhere.

    Nice. But it's dragging a bit.

    Hope some action really starts to begin .
