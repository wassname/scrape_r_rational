## [BST] Looking for suggestions on superpowers

### Post:

I've been posting chapters of *The Change Storms: Induction* here for a while, and the whole story is available for free [on my Patreon](http://patreon.com/davidstorrs) -- it'll eventually be published, at which point it may be taken down, but I'll give away an archive of it for free before I do.  

I'm looking for suggestions on superpowers, because I can always use more.

I have plenty of powers that are based on phlebotinum ("powerful telekinetc, but only with things that are triangular").  More suggestions along these lines are welcome, but I'd really like to get some that are based in physics.  I've been asking over on /r/askphysics -- I asked about "what happens if the speed of light doubles?"  (answer: nothing), and "what if the nuclear strong force doubles in strength or becomes repulsive instead of attractant?"  (answers:  "don't know" and "a sleet of ionizing radiation that kills everything in the area")

Any suggestions?

EDIT:  I should have said:  I'll credit anyone whose suggestion I use, so please add the name you'd like me to use.

  How about these: 

  -A person that can convert kinetic energy into thermal energy in a short-ranged field. Bullets become clouds of steam with no net forward motion. Punching him will scald your hand. He can perform incredible feats of impact, fall and damage resistance, but they come at the risk of boiling him alive, so he carries flas-vaporizing bottles of liquid nitrogen to act as heatsinks.

  -Quantum dis-entangler/suppressor. Had no real combat effect... but some theories maintain that our consciousness and higher-level   thought are linked to quantum properties of our intra-neuron communication. Suppressing someone's entangled neurons can cause them to become 'dumb', as in, they can think, react, feel, but not more than a really well-trained dog. In combat, being unable to react intelligently might cause you to lose. In other scenarios, you'd become much more open to suggestions, lies and misdirection, without feeling any different. 

  -Some more common examples: slowing down the speed of light. Imagine your opponent having to deal with relativistic effects at walking speed. The edges of their limbs shear off as they try to punch someone. Blood being pumped from the heart is sddenly many times heavier and blood pressure builds up... fun times.

  -A magnetic capacitor: A weak-level magnetic manipulator that can't do more than pick up a kilo or so of iron in normal circumstances, but can accumulate 'magnetic energy' over time. In a combat scenario, he can hurl cars and swing lamposts about, but if he runs out of energy, he's back to being weak. For more gun, he has no upper limit.

  -An touch-based electron-stripper 

  -A vibration manipulator that can only create extremely low Hz waves with massive pressure gradients. Basically, slow-moving aerial tsunamis. 

  And more, if you ask :)

    Nice.  I really like this one; thank you.

    Nice.  And, of course, he needs to actually absorb magnetic energy from an external field.  The Earth's field will charge him up over times, but an MRI machine is much better.  Thanks!

    Oh, the jokes....


    > And more, if you ask :)

    I'm asking. :>

      -For the magnetic capacitor guy, just make sure you shy away from recreating Electro: someone who can power up by directly connecting himself to an electric current. Maybe our magnetic protagonist wears a copper wire suit that he can hook up to the grid and turn himself into an electromagnet, thus directly feeding himself magnetic energy...

      -Why not make this an actual male stripper that was kicked out of his profession for causing electric shocks and burns?

      Other ideas will come soon. Might want to give me some direction?

      PS: Credited? I just want to contribute something back to my favorite author. 

      Hummm...

      Okay, how about this: You use anything from here in any way you like, so long as you complete another champter of Team Anko within this year? deal?

        You know, I had someone contacting me on FFN asking if anyone had volunteered to take over writing Team Anko?  You miss ONE update, everyone goes berserk. *shakes head sadly*

        It'll be back next week, don't worry. Might be a short chapter, but there'll be something.

          That person would have to step into some pretty big shoes...

          Two more ideas for today:

          -Third eye/Ghost: This person has a 'ghost' they can project from their bodies and control remotely. The ghost can phase through matter and theoretically travel right through the Earth. However, increasing the distance between ghost and user creates a feedback lag, as in, new commands are relayed instantaneously but the execution takes longer and longer to be accomplished. The supervillain uses this mostly for spying and scrying, as more solid interactions, such as manipulating switches, are very exhausting.
          Why villain? Imagine not knowing whether you're being watched, anywhere in the world.

          -'Crowdsource'. A superhero with powers proportional to the size of the crowd they're in. Basically, they skim off a portion of the surrounding people's energy, making them Superman in a bustling city, but a skinny teenager out in the forest.
          ```

          - u/eaglejarl:
            ```
            > That person would have to step into some pretty big shoes...

            Wow, thank you. You just made my day. 

            > Ghost

            Cool power. I like the time lag feature in particular. Definitely a good power for a seeker squad, and the Army of Freedom could get s lot of mileage from it too. 

            > Crowdsource 

            Nice. Especially if the drain is ongoing, and potentially dangerous. Better power for a hero, I think -- it makes for more tension if the guy has to be careful.
            ```

            - u/krakonfour:
              ```
              Had two ideas today:

              - Status quo: when this guy enters a battle, the macro outcome will be fixed. Whatever you do, the balance of power at any point of the fight will not move. The guy doesn't decide what the balance is, but he can choose whether to use it or not, so rhe onl way to beat this power is through deceit. It can also be used negatively: if you're a villain and you see Status !uo being used, kill a teammate. Enemies will die.

              Trigger: can cause anyone to have high fever symptoms and auto*immune attacks, but with no physical intermediate.

              Mutiltate: self-harm allows the user to mutate limbs into nightmarish appendages.

              Hypnolight: can cause any strong source of light into a powerful hypnotic. Hilarious when used on TV channels. Has never tried using it on the Sun...
              ```

- u/EliezerYudkowsky:
  ```
  My favorite gotcha along these lines was a Larry Niven story in which the characters discover a time accelerator - time inside the field speeds up by orders of magnitude.  Later they find out that the inventor didn't mean it as a time accelerator, he meant it as an inertia-reducing drive for space travel purposes.  It wasn't until years later that I thought back to the story and realized the link - I don't think it was ever spelled out in the story.
  ```

  - u/eaglejarl:
    ```
    I'm not seeing the connection either, aside from "super fast time emulates low inertia", which isn't something you'd get by mistake.  Enlighten me?
    ```

    - u/EliezerYudkowsky:
      ```
      If an object suddenly has 1/5 the inertia, it needs to suddenly be moving 5x as fast to preserve conservation of momentum, and so on down the line.
      ```

  - u/monster0:
    ```
    One thing that bothered me about the time bubble in Niven's *ARM* is that it seems as though the air molecules should be leaving the bubble in much higher numbers than they would be entering from outside.  So if the inertia factor is 1:500, wouldn't it be essentially vacuum inside the bubble?
    ```

    - u/EliezerYudkowsky:
      ```
      That makes sense to me.  Have you asked Niven this?  :)
      ```

  Maxwell's Demon--has the ability to make thermal energy flow from cold to hot.  Power level can be adjusted by how quickly it works and over how big an area.  Note that even with mild levels he can kill someone quite quickly by cooking their brain or heart.
  ```

  - u/eaglejarl:
    ```
    Nice.  And that would actually work on a Changed, as well, since the power isn't being used on them, it's being used on the air around them.  Spiffy.

    Name for the credit?

  Any specific area of physics you would like a focus on?

  Either way, I think forms of momentum manipulation are fairly easy to think about while still being fairly interesting. A roleplay i started involves a character that has a field in which they can sap and re-use momentum from objects in that field. Although maybe your not looking for something telekinetic-ish.

  I like to use random verbs to think of interesting abilities. Just got the word "Queue", how about some kind of local time manipulation in which you can re-queue events, or something.
  ```

- u/DCarrier:
  ```
  Perhaps something with warping spacetime. If you warp time, you get crazy gravitational forces, but warping space alone is pretty safe. As long as there's nothing rigid there. He may or may not be able to warp the space to make sure it stays flat anywhere where anything is. They could use it to make a bag of holding (although it won't be any lighter) or wormholes. I would make it so both ends of the wormhole need to be created right next to each other and then he warps space to move them apart.

  You could also ask /r/askphysics for power ideas, instead of what each individual thing will do.
  ```

- u/ulyssessword:
  ```
  Personal weight/mass manipulation:  This person can alter physics within a zone (that covers only their own body, or whatever you decide), that can increase or decrease the effect of gravity, and the inertia of matter.  The two effects could be independent (or not) and it could also include changing the direction of gravity (or not).
  ```

  - u/eaglejarl:
    ```
    A college friend of mine played a Champions character called Lightweight.  He wasn't super strong, but his strength was bought with massive amounts of extra knockback.  He did damage by smashing you into walls.  Might be fun to do something like that.

    Changing the direction of gravity could definitely be fun -- I think I might have that in my 'ideas for powersets' list, but I'd forgotten about it.  Thank you for suggesting it.
    ```

  ~~Two~~Some random suggestions:

  1. The power to decide to change your physical state and position to what it was 10 seconds ago (in the reference frame of the heaviest nearby object or something along those lines), everything else is unaffected . Naturally since your brain state is part of your physical state using this leads to losing all memories gained in that time. To make it more interesting and powerful change the time to anything less than 24 hours. Now the character has the option to do things without having knowledge of having done it as long as they do it within 24 hours of having the idea. Also creates the possibility of noticing you just made a big reset and have no idea why.

  2. Having access to your mental state precisely 10 seconds into the future that would exist if you didn't use your power in the next 10 seconds. This allows things like gather information counter factually (for example to learn what is behind the forbidden door decide that in one second you will check if you already know what is behind the door, if you don't open the door, now use you power). Also allows thinking faster than usual by repeatedly reading the mind of a version of you that has already spent time thinking about the problem, but unless the information can be absorbed very quickly this would only allow for something like a 10x speed up. Also perhaps somewhat surprisingly someone with this power can be surprised by something so long as it happens within 10 as a result of using this power.

  3. Probability manipulation working as follows: the character may specify any number of events as long as it would in principle be possible to tell if they had occurred. Then out of "all possible futures" futures in which any of the events did not occur are eliminated at a rate proportional to the number of futures remaining. So, for example if it say takes 1 hour to eliminate half of all futures then this character can make something which previously had a probability of 1/2 be guaranteed with one hour of use of their power, something with probability 1/4 with 2 hours of use of their power or something with probably 1/sqrt(2) be guaranteed with 30 minutes use of their power.
  ```

    Nice.  I especially like the first one.  I think I would do it as 'set a chrono-anchor, then revert to that anchor', and let him have up to 2 anchors set at a time, with an anchor "coming loose" after 24 hours.

    Number 2 is interesting to think about, but I think it would be hard to write for.  Not just that it's very powerful, but also that it's complicated and would be hard to explain.

    Number 3 is also very cool but hard to write.  I'll put it in the list, though.

    How would you like to be credited?

  For some phlebotinum-types, I remember writing descriptions on Reddit of characters from an old superhero campaign I ran a while back. A quick use of google shows [it was on the /r/Parahumans subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Parahumans/comments/1v82xp/what_powers_do_you_wish_were_in_worm/ceq2dyx). Forgive the Worm-style classification, since it fit the place I was posting it.

  Feel free to use anything there if it sounds interesting, but bear in mind that I was very much *not* going for a munchkinny or realistic approach to superpowers at the time.

  EDIT: Heh, I just read the OP for that thread, and *he* came up with the idea of momentum-swapping characters, too.
  ```

- u/Drazelic:
  ```
  One superpower I came up with a while ago was the idea of implementing a Speed-of-Matter constraint in the same way a Speed-of-Light constraint exists. You can create spatial bubbles where there exists an arbitrary maximum speed that physical objects are allowed to travel at, and this can be used for instance to stop incoming projectiles or to essentially kill people by preventing them from breathing.

  Fleet Mind. At will you can accelerate your mental.. And *only* your mental processes by however much you like. At significant factors, this subjectively feels like a case if lock-in because your body responds at normal speeds so from your perspective, you are a thinking statue. 

  "Sensitive". You have an absurdly keen theory of mind, and perceive the emotional state, motivation and intents of everyone with ease. 

  "Truthtell" you can't deceive. This is accompanied by the supernatural certainty in everyone you communicate with that you are not being deceptive.  

  "Causal Lightcone Enforcer".  You have been empovered by the Escaton. Time travel, ftl engines, ect, break down if within a lightyear  of you. Then you are compelled to go and destroy them.
  Akrasia has no hold on you until this is done. That's it. Those are your powers.

  ```
  * Nonchalant time-based superspeed. The less user cares, the more he/she slows down time and thus the faster he/she moves.
  * Tactile fat polarization. Ability to make lipids dissolve in water (or any other polar solvent) upon a touch. At first glance may not seem impressive, but when you consider how cellular membrane of living beings is built, it turns out to be basically touch of death.
  * Contagious reverse empathy. User of this power unconsciously makes nearby people assume his mental state and they in turn pass it on other people like a virus. If he/she gets sad, everyone gets sad; if someone pisses him/her off, it may end up with riots; if he gets drunk/doped, then well...
  * Energy storage through talismans. This power allows to sap certain kinds of energy, store it in inorganic trinkets and release on will. One trinket can keep only one kind of energy, so you cannot put e.g. lightwaves and momentum in the same object. So user can e.g. create flashbangs or accelerate himself/herself with stored momentum.

  The power of drag coefficient manipulation. Not true fluid telekinesis like Leviathan, just skin drag, pressure drag, maybe even laminar to turbulent flow boundaries.

  The wielder of that power could synergize very well with a tinker, creating otherwise-unusable hypersonic transport or projectile weapons.  Would also be very difficult to harm kinetically in an atmosphere. Offensive options would depend on manton limits, physical range, and the ability to independently affect different regions or objects.
  ```

  - u/eaglejarl:
    ```
    Oh, nice. So, she could keep the flow of air around a helicopter smooth, allowing it to move faster without the airframe getting so hammered. That's a limit my characters have been running into. 

    Likewise, she could increase the drag in a particular area so that projectiles fired through it basically stop. Maybe she could even control vortex formation to push a projectile faster. 

    Yes?
    ```

    - u/khafra:
      ```
      Yup, exactly my thoughts! For higher speeds, she could just make the airflow laminar around an arbitrarily shaped jet or rocket-powered vehicle, adding slight turbulence as needed for trajectory adjustments.  For combat, with absolute control, she could even halt melee attacks; but even slowing down punches by a significant percentage would provide a huge advantage, dropping the kinetic energy by the cube of the slowdown and throwing off the attacker's expectations.  Asphyxiation, of course, would depend on the manton limits of the power.
      ```
