  I like how Brock is a beginner gym not because he's the easiest, but because he's one of the hardest. No one wants to screw with his OP level 100 Onix.

  - u/Gigapode:
    ```
    Yeah thats a cool idea. The gym leaders set encounters based on your progression rather than having set "encounters" based on whether you having pokemon that know cut :p

    So you can strategically takle the gyms in the order you want based on how difficult their theoretical best would be for you to beat. Whether that be to make it easier for your team or to get more renown as a trainer.
    ```

    - u/Jokey665:

      The Pokemon Origins movie/ova/whatever it was did this. It was pretty cool.
      ```

    - u/PDNeznor:
      ```
      On a similar note, I wonder how the gym leaders would handle somebody like Gold/Ethan coming in with all of the Johto badges already. "Oh, you already have 11 badges? Let me check my gym leader guidebook for your handicap. Huh, says here to just give you the badge, 'for my pokemon's well-being' or something."
      ```

      - u/Ceres_Golden_Cross:
        ```
        That makes me wonder how strong the elite 4 are, since in the game the weakest could destroy any leader
        ```

      - u/Ulmaxes:
        ```
        Running purely off what we know from the games, the leaders just got harder and harder. As Blue mentions, even eight-badge isn't the Leader's Best, just them actually trying. I suspect that'd keep scaling at one point. I suspect skill plateaus quicker than a sixteen-badge run, so at that point it'd be just fighting everyone at their best and it being a solid challenge.
        ```

  - u/empocariam:
    ```
    I wonder who the opposite of Brock is then. The leader everyone saves for last. Maybe Erika? The grass-type, even at its best, doesn't strike me as particularly strong, assuming a skilled trainer knows how to overcome a status-condition based strategy.
    ```

    - u/ManyCookies:
      ```
      Erika is plausible, she's a younger leader with a counterable type focus. Blaine and Surge are more experienced, but they have similarly iffy monotypes (Amy's brother did pick Surge as his 8th). On the other hand, the gym leaders are holding back even on 8th badge/membership challenges; perhaps those three just play a bit more seriously, closer to their full potential, to compensate for their weaker monotypings/skills.

      And of course Brock was the pushover [Bubble the Onix](https://images2.memedroid.com/images/UPLOADED34/5198cd964677b.jpeg) gym on paper, and he ended up with rock snake godzilla. Lord knows what nonsense the other gym leaders get (Contrary Serperior for Erika?).
      ```

      - u/Ceres_Golden_Cross:
        ```
        This story makes the leader so freaking awesome, we are already hyped to meet the rest
        ```

    - u/Electric999999:
      ```
      What about Koga, I don't remember him having anything particularly impressive pokemon and poison is probably one of the weakest types in general, anyone who can handle getting poisoned can probably deal well with him. Of course poison might be a lot scarier than I'm thinking in this setting, since you have a much harder time judging it's effects on your pokemon.
      ```

      - u/DaystarEld:
        ```
        >Of course poison might be a lot scarier than I'm thinking in this setting, since you have a much harder time judging it's effects on your pokemon.

        Also, in the games Poison is one of the status effects without a secondary effect, the way Paralyze cuts Speed or Burn cuts Attack. I always thought Poison should reduce Evasion or increase PP use or something to reflect that the pokemon is not just losing generic "hit points" that don't mean anything until they're at 0, but actually feeling the effects of the poison as they fight.
        ```

      - u/PDNeznor:
        ```
        Janine's Arbok was pretty frickin scary when it was just slithering around. I'd hate to put any of my pokemon in front of that thing's fangs. I can only imagine Koga's pokemon would ramp that up another notch or two for the 8th badge. He'll also probably become an E4 member as well, attributing to his battling skill (probably second to Giovanni in Kanto).

        My money would be on Blaine, Misty, or Erika. Blaine as I see him spending more of his energies doing research rather than improving as a trainer, Misty is quite young and possibly quite green in relation to the rest of the leaders, and Erika for what ManyCookies already stated. (Although a Vileplume with full access to Effect Spore AoE's, Chlorophyll's quickness, Strength Sap's longevity and debilitation, and Solar Beams bright enough to blind people as well as burn them up Kamehameha style would be frickin terrifying too.)

          ```
          I'm saving this thread, I love how it shows what this story has done to us, guessing which leader/pokémon is more terrifying
          ```

  - u/Golden_Magician:
    ```
    Perhaps Brock and Sabrina aren't the only gym leaders with a famous ace pokemon..I imagine that Misty's Starmie, Surge's Raichu and Blaine's Ninetales or Charizard might also be up there.
    ```

    - u/ManyCookies:
      ```
      I'm sure the gym leaders have their own preferred pokemon*, just not as flashy and overpowered as the 200 foot long rock snake or the Zam that solo'd a leadership challenge.

      ^(*Complete WMG: Blaine has a very rare Drought Ninetales as an ace, which is obviously terrifying and shores up the big water weakness.)

  Ugh. That was an amazing chapter. I was right alongside Aiko on that emotional rollercoaster.

  [spoilers](#s " But how could you do this to Kemuri! And not even from Blue’s perspective! You tore my heart right out there. Well done. And he didn’t even get the Onix! From that range! Edit: Someone made a post in the Monday thread which made me realise I wanted to be clear about the following: I love this story; I’m immensely grateful to the author for writing it and I’m super happy they take me on a journey where I can have such strong feelings about the events along the way. The strong emotional connections to characters is important to me. It’s a large part of why I love reading so much. The grief and pain I feel for Blue’s loss of Kemuri and for Kemuri as a character is vivid emotion and I’m glad for it, as much as it may hurt in the moment.")

  Riveting chapter.

  Pressure is *rough*. I could feel Aiko's paralyzing fear, and even though I know she's been hit with it before, I agree that she made a lot of mistakes. Reverse tolerance sucks.

  /u/DaystarEld, did you invent this "critical group debugging" tactic? It seems very useful, if only to be attempted with a group you really trust.
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    Sort of: it's kind of a rough amalgamation of what I've seen and facilitated within the rationality community (CFAR workshops and ESPR camp), specifically things like pair debugging and circling, filtered through a Heroic Responsibility lens. I think it's definitely a valuable mentality to cultivate and establish among friends and in communities that you trust to help hold each other accountable and build each other up.

    Glad you liked the chapter!

      It seems extremely useful for groups who regularly experience highly dangerous/stressful events. That doesn't describe me now, but I'll keep it in mind for my future band of post-apocalyptic survivors.

  Great chapter as usual! Always sad to see the characters go through trauma, but I guess it helps them grow. I highly doubt Blue, for example, would have been able to survive the encounter if he hadn't already dealt with similar situations before. Shame about him losing such an ace though. Did you perhaps allow him to lose Kermui because it was so powerful and Blue was still relatively early in his journey, forcing him to adapt? Maybe I'm just overanalyzing things.

  Oh, and this has nothing to do with this chapter in particular, but I was wondering something about the world of your story. Do Mega Evolution and Z Moves exist in this world and if so, how do they function? I imagine they would work much differently in your rational story as opposed to running on the power of friendship and dancing like in the games.

  Considering how many thrown pokeballs were missed in this chapter, there might be some value yet for Bill to apply his pokeball-throwing physics knowledge into inventing some kind of an automatic launcher.

      I can't tell which part of my speculation you're hinting is on track. Now I'm just sitting here starting to wonder if the pokeball containing Absol's going to glitch and spontaneously release it at the worst possible moment.

      This is just my imagination, right? An Absol can't actually do anything once it's digitized into a pokeball...right?
      ```

      - u/Electric999999:
        ```
        I don't think it can do anything while in a pokeball, they all felt the pressure lift as soon as it was caught and I don't think things inside pokeballs can really do anything at all, they don't seem to even really experience the flow of time.
        ```

  - u/PDNeznor:
    ```
    That unluckiness is probably more attributed to Absol's super luck ability (which is very likely not realized to be a thing in this pokeverse). Thinking about it, the shenanigans that pressure puts the trainers through probably amplifies the effectiveness of super luck, making this particular Absol a terrible guest at poker nights.

    Nitpicks:

    >Dune digs his claws into a boulder segment about halfway along the onix's body just before it rolls to the side to

    "It" is ambiguous here.

    >It displaces both… along with four thin wedges

    Here too. It'd understandable when the entire sentence is read but the reading process is made unnecessarily more difficult.

    >fear for her pokemon suddenly suffocating her,

    I'm nitpicking more and more here but this could be interpreted as fear that her pokemon will suffocate and kill her.

    >Aiko spends another moment paralyzed with indecision, trying to decide what to do.

    Again, nitpicking but "trying to decide what to do" is redundant with "indecision."

    >and it staggers under the blows, body rolling

    Ambiguous it.

    >she thrashes in bed a moment, then realizes where she is and collapses back onto the hospital bed, 

    Redundant bed.
    ```

    - u/thrawnca:
      ```
      > "It" is ambiguous here.

      Not really; Dune is male, and referred to as such in this sentence.

      > this could be interpreted as fear that her pokemon will suffocate and kill her.

      No, that would be worded as "fear *of* her pokemon", not "fear *for* her pokemon".
      ```

      - u/appropriate-username:
        ```
        > Not really; Dune is male, and referred to as such in this sentence.

        So why's dune gendered and an Onix is not? Then that in and of itself is stylistically weird.

        >No, that would be worded as "fear of her pokemon", not "fear for her pokemon".

        Maybe "her fear for her pokemon" would sound better? Also now that I've read the sentence like 5 more times, it looks pretty run-on to me.
        ```

        - u/thrawnca:
          ```
          > So why's dune gendered and an Onix is not? Then that in and of itself is stylistically weird.

          Probably because Dune matters to Aiko as a person, whereas the onix - while technically having a gender - matters as a threat, an obstacle.

          Both pokemon have genders, so could use "s/he", and both, as non-humans, could validly be referred to as "it" - in general. In this case, though, using a personal pronoun for one and non-personal for the other makes sense in context and removes the ambiguity.

          > Maybe "her fear for her pokemon" would sound better?

          I don't see any advantage in adding the word. It's unambiguous as it stands.

            Looks like it, though I dunno how obvious Onix sexual characteristics are so dunno whether it makes sense that she knows.

  Hello there! As always, the story is awesome. I'm still working in a table rpg adaptation, and I have stumbled upom the aura topic. I don't know how you will deal with it, so I thought I would both ask you your ideas and share mines too (probably not compatible with yours as I take the types as connected to actual elemental powers)

  My idea is to take the mind-soul/aura-heart dynamic, based on the eastern concepts. Well, mind actually is your version, the thoughts linked to some physical phenomenom. The types related to it are psychic (duh), dark (I guess) and ghost (you have yet to explain that one)

  Then we have the aura, the eastern concept of spirit (very different to plato's) which is heavilly conected to "physicall vitaliy", hence fighting as its main type. Every living being has an aura, but I consider types able to "pulse" as able to harness their aura in a lesser way. Those are water, dragon, phychic (heal pulse, that might be hard to explain) and dark (that will make cool stories. Mind blocked, but able to burst their auras)

  Lastly, "heart". IIRC, in eastern cultures the organ hosts the feelings and life of the individual. With the modern science, it had been dismised... like the fairy type. I will leave it that way for now ;) 

  Also, I pretend to use those concepts to explain legendary pokémon, with their legendary hearts and auras (need a cooler name tho)

  Well, what do you think? Sounds cool? Potential? And how are you going to do it? I'm specially interested in your version of ghost types

  Have a nice day!
