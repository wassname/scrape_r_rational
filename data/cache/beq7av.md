## could you recommend a few chapters if in case there aren't really any short rational fictions? thanks

### Post:

something positive 

rational or rationalist, any genre it's good 

can you link something really good that can be listened to (on youtube etc) or read right now?


2. positive

1. short (or a passage / chapter within something longer)

cant think of anything else, no other requirements besides these two 

mainly want to see if something really good is fully logical, and how the style is

    Also [Instruments of Destruction](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11685932/1/Instruments-of-Destruction). (Of which there is a 30 minute [narrated](http://www.hpmorpodcast.com/?p=1932) version.)

  How about [Ted Chiang](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/130698.Ted_Chiang)? He writes only short stories and the [stories](https://freesfonline.de/authors/Ted_Chiang.html) he has written tend to be a good fit for this subreddit. I recommend [Exhalation](http://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/exhalation/) as the best story for this community.

  Note that I just linked to a collection of some of his stories, but not all of his works are included.

  If you want to get all of them, he has two collections on Amazon: [Stories of Your Life and Others](https://www.amazon.com/Stories-Your-Life-Others-Chiang-ebook/dp/B0048EKOP0/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=ted+chiang&qid=1555647513&s=digital-text&sr=1-3) and [Exhalation: Stories](https://www.amazon.com/Exhalation-Stories-Ted-Chiang-ebook/dp/B07GD46PQZ/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=ted+chiang&qid=1555647513&s=digital-text&sr=1-2).

  There's a specific chapter of *Pokemon: The Origin of Species* that Daystar noted as being fairly standalone, hang on...
  ```

    Here it is: http://daystareld.com/pokemon-28/

    I did note that you specified "something positive" though it is unclear to me whether that means you want to read something uplifting/optimistic, in which case maybe this doesn't satisfy that criterion.

  From K J Parker "A Small Price to Pay for Birdsong" ([https://web.archive.org/web/20130527092350/http://subterraneanpress.com/magazine/winter\_2011/fiction\_a\_small\_price\_to\_pay\_for\_birdsong\_by\_k.\_j.\_parker/](https://web.archive.org/web/20130527092350/http://subterraneanpress.com/magazine/winter_2011/fiction_a_small_price_to_pay_for_birdsong_by_k._j._parker/)  ) 

  can recommend his other works as well (The Folding Knife is short and really well done). Former Discussion about K J Parker : [https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/92mv36/k\_j\_parker/](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/92mv36/k_j_parker/) 

   Also  "The Dark Wizard of Donkerk"  by Alexander Wales is often recommended and fairly short : [http://www.alexanderwales.com/darkWizardNaNo2016.html](http://www.alexanderwales.com/darkWizardNaNo2016.html)
