  (I found the story from https://particularvirtue.blogspot.com/2017/08/online-fiction-ive-been-reading-lately.html, and in the last week I've read up to the current point)

  I've really enjoyed the story. It is about 3/5 as long as Worm so far and new chapters are coming out regularly. The author is definitely nowhere near the end yet.

  The description from that blogpost is

  > You know how webcomics like Questionable Content have an extremely clear arc in the creator's art skill, from the beginning to present? This is the first time I've seen this happen clearly in a solely written web serial.
  > 
  > The protagonist, Erin Solstice, is from our world, and wakes up one day to find herself fighting off low-level monsters in a fantasy world. After a day of just barely surviving monster attacks, she finds an abandoned inn, cleans it up, collapses in a heap... and just before falling asleep, she hears the words in her head: "Innkeeper Level 1!" The series follows her and her adventures in a world with monsters, levels, and sapient nonhumans.
  > 
  > Erin is a great example of a character motivated primarily by friendship who is super badass. Her foil and the secondary protagonist, Ryoka, is close to the mold of a stereotypical rationalfic protagonist: logical, intelligent, knowledgeable about our world's science and technology, bitter, and bad with people. But they're each extraordinary in their own way, showing that greatness can come from many sources.
  > 
  > The main downside of this series is that it drags. Many words lie between the most interesting events of the story. I'm also annoyed that the author frequently breaks lines on dialogue unnecessarily, which makes it hard to tell what's going on.

  Some parts are definitely reaching rationalism levels, especially in the last third of what's been written so far. There are also a few points when it's a bit weak and not even rational, especially at the beginning of the story. It's definitely worth getting through those to get to the good stuff.

    I stopped reading it after she found some food in the cabinet after a number of days in the inn. She cleaned the whole place up and went out looking for food but didn't look in the cabinets? It must get better or so many people wouldn't be into it, but I found the beginning to be quite annoying.
    ```

    - u/Vielfras8:
      ```
      From what I remember she found that on the next day she arrived in the inn.
      Quickly searched the inn in the morning hoping she would find something and gave up quickly because her stomach was rumbling badly. Decided to search for something to eat around the inn instead and found some. Wanted to try preparing it and did a proper systematic search of the whole kitchen only to find food in one of the cupboards.

      I agree that she should've searched better from the start but that's just how Erin is (as well as many people I know). She's a kind hearted young girl with her head in the clouds and not a rationalist skeptic.

      If this is what made you drop the story I'd recommend trying it again and reading until Chess starts playing a role in the plot. 

      In my opinion The Wandering Inn is a modern age fairy tail that I can't wait to read to my children before bed, once they're a little bit older. And over the years both the writing and story become exceptionally better.
      One of the only webnovels that managed to make me tear up or laugh out loud on more than one occasions.

      I read the first seven chapters and then stopped. I don't know what the total word count was at that point, but I felt like almost nothing had happened and was annoyed by both the pace and the prose.

      I feel bad about putting down things that people say get better later on, because I'm sure there's some good stuff that can be found by wading through when the work plods, but I always start thinking about the other ways I could be spending my time, and eventually I get antsy enough that I can't go on.

        Fair enough. 
        The early chapters are bad enough(compared to the rest of the story) that even the author says she's dreading the eventual rewrite that she will have to do.
        Maybe you'll have better luck with it once the book version is released in the far future.

        Till then there are far to many stories out there to suffer through something you don't enjoy :)

        It's a lot of chapters before it grew on me but it's definitely not because of Erin and anything  she has to do. By far, everything I hate about the story centres around Erin, she's  probably one of the dumbest most annoying characters I've ever had the misfortune to read! 

        Although things does get better once, mild spoilers, the perspective shifts to a different main character. Ryoka. It gets more refreshing and it starts to dive into more world building, actually, most other perspectives will offer more world building and lore than anything  Erin chapters have to offer. But back to the point, Ryoka has quite the anger management issue and it leads her to make some real stupid decisions, which is very very grating to read. And all I have to say is that the author really has a knack in making likeable characters unrelatable and infuriating. Though it doesn't get much better at least until arc 2 where there's this noticeable improvement in quality once the main players are in play.

        All in all I actually enjoyed this the more I read, the world as it is with its different players has so much to offer and so much lore and world building etc that it keeps pulling me back. Thats my thoughts on it, it's like a light game of thrones with the many events and perspectives taking place but with a dense, thick headed main character.

        I've just finished reading all of the chapters. It does get much better but I'd also recommend skipping the first 20 chapters...
        I've also skipped all the ryoka chapters on the first volume. After reading those, I think it's the right choice. Ryoka is much better in the 2nd volume but in the first volume she's an unlikable unstable stupid angsty teen.
        ```

- u/AugSphere:
  ```
  Does the protagonist ever get even a little bit agenty? Because judging by everything I've seen of it and the first couple of chapters I managed to read, it looks like she'll never intentionally set out to do anything of consequence. A story about an innkeeper NPC doesn't really seem appealing to me.
  ```

  - u/Diralman_:
    ```
    The first several chapters are for the most part the weakest. Personally, I felt the story first started coming together when the first side characters were introduced. There are actually two main characters: Erin who remains the innkeeper and is sociable and resilient, and Ryoka who is a Runner(messenger) and is intelligent and adventurous.

    Ryoka is out and about the world more often, but Erin doesn't just hang around the inn either. Most of the time Erin leaves the inn it's for an inn-related purpose, but that doesn't mean that doesn't involve her hunting monsters or heading into a dungeon. Ryoka on the other hand naturally gets into trouble.

    The main point is that story isn't about how an innkeeper works in an inn. It is about how the story and actions of this innkeeper play a part in the greater story of the world which filled with diverse factions and a rich history.

      That's all useful information, but none of it seems to answer my question about protagonist(s) setting out to do anything of consequence. There is nothing wrong with slice of life in a fictional setting, but that's not what I'm looking for these days.

      Honestly, it sounds like the very best you could do with this setup is something like a story about someone working at Caf√© Central in early twentieth century. Certainly there is an appeal, but I'd prefer if the story followed one of many interesting people that visit it, rather than a girl who happened to serve food to many interesting people, but isn't terribly interesting or notable herself. 

      A POV focused on someone who will at best be mentioned in footnotes of history books, if even that, feels like a waste.
      ```

      - u/Diralman_:
        ```
        I guess it depends on what you consider consequential. I'm not caught up nor is it completed so I can't answer definitively, but I doubt any of the protagonists will be conquering kingdoms. And even if it did, there are volumes of other works that get to the point faster.

        The characters do have agency in some areas such as confronting intolerance or repaying debts to lost friends, but mostly their impact on the world is accidental. [Minor Spoilers](#s "Such as Erin turning Antitium into individuals, or unleashing knowledge from our world that could have unforeseen consequences.") 

        I would say Erin is interesting after reading nearly 2 massive volumes. However, although she is important to characters who are important, she isn't very recognized to the greater part of the world. I could talk in further depth of her character, but if you aren't looking for a protagonist that is more directly impacting the world, this might not be what you are looking for.

          Thanks. This is the information I was after. I guess I'll come back to this work when I'm in a mood for a low-scale story.

            Hi, just wanted to say that a character that has been stated to be a protagonist in the future is an [](#s "[Emperor] class"), and will most definitely do things of consequence. I also think you'll like the most recent sidestory, following a [Doctor], as I feel like it actually doesn't have any of the things you complained about. Chapter 1 is [here](https://wanderinginn.wordpress.com/2017/07/14/1-00-d/), the climax chapter 2 is [here](https://wanderinginn.wordpress.com/2017/07/14/1-01-d/)

             That being said, I totally get if this isn't your cup of tea.

        Goblins are horrible creatures. There's a bounty on them, and they're all considered to be criminals by default.

        Erin has a "no murdering goblins" rule. This has gotten people killed. This has gotten her severely injured several times. It's probably a bad decision.

        But she also has several regular goblin customers, who interact peacefully with the other patrons.

        In so far as she has agency, she's *tolerant*. Not in the "I can tolerate anything except the outgroup" sense, but actually tolerant.

        It's not what I'd call "agency", she's not working towards a larger goal, or anything like that. But it is interesting, and they show the consequences relatively realistically.

  All right, I like this story, and it's definitely one of the better litrpgs. But, seriously, this ain't a rational story. The main character is an actual idiot, in the old school, God smiles on the dimwitted, savant sense. The secondary lead is more intelligent, but far from rational. She's a highly educated, tightly compressed ball of emotional triggers.

    Really, I posted this because of a few scenes involving Magnolia in the end of arc 2. Of course, that's far off from the beginning of the story...
    ```

- u/SimonSim211:
  ```
  it seems like I got further before stopping (2.08), I mainly stopped due to the annoying runner girl and what I found a bit pointless violence (it feels like there is plot armour, but then it gets removed in rather harrowing scenes).
  If you aren't looking for a feel good story, you might enjoy it.

  ```
  There are quite a few valid criticisms in this thread. But despite many of them being valid I have to say this is a tremendously enjoyable and well written piece of fiction. I particularly appreciate what a sprawling believable world it takes place in.

  The novel has an interesting premise but one word i can say about it thats its inconsistent. Especially so in the begining where atleast for myself i found the characterization of erin extremaly inconsistent. IT stabilized in the later part of the story but god damn was it annoying while reading. Also the power levels are quite... inconsistent aswell i think that author like changed his/her opinion like 2 times in the story in terms of establishing powerlevels and it shows.

  also 2 main characters are annoying af. I cant stand especially ryoka because she is edgy and a mary sue with her knowledge and ability even if they arent as useful in the fantasy world. Also erin is just stupid. She is clumsy and easy to distract as if those traits served some purpose to nerf her so she wont be too op, but she is anyways and its annoying that at the begining of the story she didnt act that way. 

  the story is pretty good anyways its would just need a serious editing and a rewrite and i am pretty sure the author wont do that so :/

  edit: not that i want to whine about downvotes but i want to whine about downvotes. Downvoting for opinions is kinda bad and i would gladly discuss anything related to this novel and why i am not fond of it, just comment, message me or smth...idk

    Erin just gets worse. It's very odd, especially how she starts treating fiction as real (Thinking LOTR elves are the same as the half-elf she runs into) and then promptly forgets bits of the fiction she *should* know just for plot reasons. 

    Fairy gold, for instance. She knows enough about the fair folk to give them a proper feast... but doesn't remember far more pertinent details. She treats the skeleton as if he is retarded but is continually surprised when he makes a mistake. 

    It's a fun story, but my experience is it gets worse as time goes on. The concept is great, but it feels like bad things happen for no reason but to keep Erin scrabbling.

      yep erin is just stupid and it takes a lot out of me to enjoy the story. But the biggest offender for me is still Ryoka as she is just freaking edgy, annoying, know it all mary sue. Erin comes fairly close tho and i just hate them both.
      ```

      - u/Izeinwinter:
        ```
        Ryoka antagonises all her friends for terrible reasons, has a massive deathwish and plot armor a mile thick. 
        Basically she is Netflix daredevil as a PoC woman. She is just as annoying as he is. IE: VERY.
