## Rational!Attack On Titan.

### Post:

Honestly, I've never gotten into this show- I couldn't, The background was just too depressing for me. Therefore, I'm not an expert in any sort of way.

Humanity, the most warlike species on planet earth, is handed an enemy where the only option is total eradication, and instead of a cold war of technology, they just sit with their thumbs jammed in their asses for a hundred years. At least, this is what I've gathered, feel free to correct me.

So, obviously, that would be the first thing to change. The spiderman-cables-thing is a nice first step, but really. Does anyone actually familiar with the show have an idea of how a rational, or at least more realistic society would have reacted to the events of the backstory, leading to a better starting point?

  Reddit has long been a hot spot for conversation on the internet. About 57 million people visit the site every day to chat about topics as varied as makeup, video games and pointers for power washing driveways.

  In recent years, Reddit’s array of chats also have been a free teaching aid for companies like Google, OpenAI and Microsoft. Those companies are using Reddit’s conversations in the development of giant artificial intelligence systems that many in Silicon Valley think are on their way to becoming the tech industry’s next big thing.

  Now Reddit wants to be paid for it. The company said on Tuesday that it planned to begin charging companies for access to its application programming interface, or A.P.I., the method through which outside entities can download and process the social network’s vast selection of person-to-person conversations.

  “The Reddit corpus of data is really valuable,” Steve Huffman, founder and chief executive of Reddit, said in an interview. “But we don’t need to give all of that value to some of the largest companies in the world for free.”

  The move is one of the first significant examples of a social network’s charging for access to the conversations it hosts for the purpose of developing A.I. systems like ChatGPT, OpenAI’s popular program. Those new A.I. systems could one day lead to big businesses, but they aren’t likely to help companies like Reddit very much. In fact, they could be used to create competitors — automated duplicates to Reddit’s conversations.

  Reddit is also acting as it prepares for a possible initial public offering on Wall Street this year. The company, which was founded in 2005, makes most of its money through advertising and e-commerce transactions on its platform. Reddit said it was still ironing out the details of what it would charge for A.P.I. access and would announce prices in the coming weeks.

  Reddit’s conversation forums have become valuable commodities as large language models, or L.L.M.s, have become an essential part of creating new A.I. technology.

  L.L.M.s are essentially sophisticated algorithms developed by companies like Google and OpenAI, which is a close partner of Microsoft. To the algorithms, the Reddit conversations are data, and they are among the vast pool of material being fed into the L.L.M.s. to develop them.

    I agree with your post's points about the magical, physics-defying things that happen in the world being strange, but I don't think that precludes a rationalfic!AoT story. As long as the author has a good set of offstage rules governing the events, it's possible to have rational characters and irrational NPCs interacting to create a rationalist or rational story.

    Remember, just because it's rational doesn't mean it has to obey our interpretation of physics. In the as-yet-unwritten rational!Gurren Lagann, Simon still goes beyond the impossible and punches reason to the curb. Simon's irrationality was cultivated by Kamina, who saw that irrational thought gave Simon power. Sometimes, the rational course of action is to be irrational.

          > It's a bit like being a rational actor on the front lines of WW1. You might be making better decisions but the end result is in favour of you getting killed just like the rest.

          A better comparison might be, speedrunning a platformer versus speedrunning a racing game. In most games, minimizing time isn't the explicit goal, so there's usually easy exploits around saving time because the developers weren't thinking in terms of preventing that. Racing games, meanwhile, were designed around a zero-sum time-based competition, so there's (usually) no low-hanging time-saving fruit.

          Likewise, military settings already assume that everyone is sensibly using decent tactics and strategy and maintaining decent OPSEC/COMSEC and running an R&D department and doing siege and trench and guerilla warfare where appropriate and performing espionage and trying to sway the locals with propaganda, etc etc. So there's no low-hanging killing-the-other-guys fruit in a military setting. (So when there *is* a shortcut, it's usually more an intersection of military with diplomatic or economic interests. All the Vorkosigan total-war-is-imminent scenarios resolve this way.)

    Agreed, I find the 100 years cowering behind the wall to be entirely believable. 99.9% of the population of earth appears to have been wiped out - that's more than enough to usher in a new dark age. We had 1,000 years in europe without developing much military tech to boast of. Also, yes, in large populations, you always have a core of ambitious competent people who move the important levers, but in a single city, there's no guarantee you'll get people competent and ambitious and motivated and who actually succeed at getting a large amount of peasants to follow them.

    How they maintained as much technology as they did? That is a little more tenuous, but there clearly was an organized effort (or otherwise an act of "god") to build those walls and set up the society, so the military was almost certainly in place from day 1. The only highish-tech items you see are pneumatics, gunpowder, and railroads - all very important strategic tech. If there's any knowledge that'll survive a dark age, it'll be knowledge of religious or military significance.

  Timelooped is right, there's a lot of background wonkiness and secret reasons going on in the background of the manga that make it a bit early for this kind of criticism. 

  That aside, generally speaking I would expect humans to make underground tunnel systems, unless titans showed both the ability to sense humans underground and the capability and intelligence to dig well. You might even see a slightly gurren lagann-esque underground human expansion thing going on. 

  The only possible easy answer to the titan problem as a whole is some kind of plague or bioweapon. Again, wonky physiology magical stuff going on with the titans might nullify this in the canon, but if titans were just huge, dumb, predatory animals, it could work extremely well. You'd need to develop it in a sect of humanity completely separated from the rest and in secret (potential to wipe all of humanity out significant), but it's certainly feasible.
  ```

  - u/literal-hitler:
    ```
    I think they can sense groups of humans through objects, so I don't think tunneling is much of an option. They don't need to be good at digging, just persistent.
    ```

- u/philip1201:
  ```
  The titans as portrayed in the series are very stupid. Stupid enough to walk into a wall of spikes to try to get at the humans above it.

  After the fall of the outer wall, there were 250,000 people who could not be fed, and were sent out to be eaten by Titans. 250,000 people killed in the most brutal fashion of the series. The most elite warriors in the army tend to have killed an average of 10 titans, for perhaps 1000 titan kills in the entire army.

  This means we have 250,000 people who could have been used as fishing bait - humans attached to hooks of sufficient size to suspend a titan from - and killed 200,000 titans instead of 1,000, without being any more cruel than the leadership in the series. Given how stupid the titans are, there are probably ways to do this which aren't 100% fatal to the humans being used.

  ---

  The area around the gates is the worst defensible place in the city: a large, flat open terrain where the titans can roam free and humans are bound to the ground. That makes no sense: the gates are a bottleneck and a known weak point (after the fall of the outer wall, but also because common sense) and should therefore be designed to be the most easily defensible.

  The entire city should be designed to be inconvenient for Titans. In the series all the rooftops seem to be conveniently at arm height. Buildings should be too high for Titans to see over, removing tactical information and allowing them to be more easily attacked from high ground.

  Underground tunnels should also be commonplace, too narrow for Titans to enter and too deep for them to break into.

  Use giant tree forest wood in construction. There's enough of it to go around.

  ---

  tl;dr: AoT is running on rule of cool, at the cost of making leaders tactically incompetent.

  (Spoilers below)

  As far as wall design, it would change every few decades. There would be pockets of Titans within the city that were sealed off and exterminated in the process of reconstruction and likewise there would be instances of individual towns getting isolated and surrounded.

  The 3D gear has to change, but not as much as most people are thinking. The very specific weakness of the Titans means the gear as shown is in fact almost optimized, given the tech we know human society has. It's mentioned that projectile blades don't have enough power to penetrate the neck, even when aimed perfectly. The Titans burn hot, making ropes or even chains not viable for more than a few seconds, especially when combined with their strength. If you dig a trench, it will fill with living Titans and the next wave will walk over their heads.

  The Titan-shifters complicate things, as usual. If you can't get rid of it, roll with it. Titans don't get their mass from our universe, but rather an adjacent hell-dimension. That's why they burn hot. The heat is leftover from the punch between realities. That's also how the shifters can grow fifty meters in height and why they leave their Titan bodies behind when they change back. This makes the walls being made of abandoned shifter husks especially practical, as its a fast and seemingly infinite building material that can be molded by the intent of the architect in a matter of minutes instead of months.

  That's all I've got right now.

  The Mobility Gear is, by far, the coolest part of the show - **cutting out the spiderman cables would be like writing HPMOR in a non-magical world.** Yuck. I say take their existence as given, then analyze *how* they might work, and ask what sorts of clever tricks *and* clever challenges might these mechanics present!

  As for intelligence of the characters: the true bad guys and their motives still have much to be revealed. The government and some military officials are off to save their own skin, and are content to let the rest of the world burn - this is despicable, but quite realistic. It's even rational, according to the problem of collective action - they can let someone else save the world while they stay safe. Meanwhile, among the heroes and villains we see so far, no one holds the idiot ball to my notice. Heroes take their job very seriously, and don't take stupid risks. So points there.

  Honestly, there's not a glaring hole to correct in a Rational AoT, as far as I can see. Have more fun with the 3D Mobility Gear, replace cowardly government officials with ruthless and forward-thinking individuals, have the humans better prepared, and step up the threat from the baddies accordingly.

  Also, if you're on the fence, watch it. I never watch TV anymore, but my word, that show is amazing, and it was all I could do not to binge it.
