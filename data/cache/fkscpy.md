  Ah yes, that's eminently healthy.

    I'm inclined to let this one slide, it has been a very chaotic (and short) time period for all of this.

    With the number of events, this feels to me it should have taken place over a week or so.  The players have all been very, very rushed.

  In trying times, it's good to have fics like this to distract us. I sense that isolation measures will cause an uptick in both webfic writing and readership.

  Some thoughts:

  * Merchants can answer technical questions about the game, albeit with an NP cost after the first few. Maya needs to make a list with the other players present and abuse the heck out of this.

  * The first settlement scored every member of species D in the region a + 1 to Earth Affinity. This implies that other Prime skills may have similar rewards.

  * By appearances, Nathan's settlement may get hit by a "bonus" Boss, which will spawn to attack the frogmen.

  * Additional merchants will probably have a brief Q & A period for players, much like the weapon merchant.

  * The ability to sell weapons for NPs is a clear reward for player creativity. It also allows for NP transfer between players, albeit with a significant loss. Since *Equipment Fusion I* bears some resemblance to *Buildings I* skill, it looks like there may be a hidden reward for obtaining the third recipe, or perhaps selling a third weapon type to a merchant.
  ```

  - u/ansible:
    ```
    Additional thoughts:

    * It is implied by the weapon vendor that there are no other weapon vendors up with the other groups / species yet.  That may be good news.

      Good catch!

      > Once other weapon vendors are built **in the arena**, the sold weapons may be purchased by anyone at any of our locations.

      Huh! Not just a regional first, an *arena* first.

      Also, if players coordinate, there is now a way to move some types of gear across the entire arena by spending NPs. A team could have a secluded and entrenched supply base that a forward team could access on the road.
      ```

        > A team could have a secluded and entrenched supply base that a forward team could access on the road.

        Possibly.  The vendor markup may be high enough to discourage this activity.

      Well, they were first to build any building, and it required some reading to find out that they could also get the settlement bonus. Others would probably not have figured that out because they would not have got the first bonus from a building. So they would not have prioritized the buildings as much.
      ```

    ```
    Considering you get a set time period to ask free questions in, You really ought to prepare a list of question ahead of time and then rattle them off as quick as you can. Noone has paper, So there'll have to be some memorisation.
    ```

    - u/Brell4Evar:

      Listing out potential questions would make a good discussion.
      ```

- u/WalterTFD:
  ```
  The frogs attacking immediately before the boss fight is strange.  Ten minutes is roughly forever in sword fighting time, so I don't think this will be a 3 way fight.  It feels like this decision is strictly inferior to whichever of 'attack long enough beforehand that you have time to heal up' or 'attack literally during the boss fight' they prefer.

  &#x200B;

  My current guess is that they just attacked as soon as they got here, not caring about the boss fight.  They big mad about the first ambush, basically.
  ```

  - u/Brell4Evar:
    ```
    *Buildings I* skill is exclusive to humanity right now. It's possible they were planning something when they stumbled across the outhouse, which they figured to be a game feature.

    From [Chapter 20](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/27800/the-elemental-arena/chapter/461691/chapter-twenty-discovery):
    > About ten minutes before, Lilly had activated her Buildings skill to purchase the outhouse building.  She placed it about fifty yards North of the medical tent about ten feet off the trail.

    From [Chapter 22](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/27800/the-elemental-arena/chapter/469630/chapter-twenty-two-preparation):
    > Then he heard a scream, a human one, originating from the North trail.

    So, someone came across frogmen poking around the loo.

    We don't know how large their force is. They may outnumber the humans. They also may each be sitting on a physical skill upgrade to use following their attack on the camp.
