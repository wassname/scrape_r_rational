  Eh. I think Egan's main problem is that he can't write a good villain because he can't make himself believe, internally, that they have a point. All his bad guys end up caricatures.

  Pretty good Turing Fuck Yeah story though. (TFY)

    I see most of his stories as basically villainless, this one included.  I don't see Hamilton as a villain, but as an essentially noble adversary the main characters are unable to save.

      Fair enough. All I can say is, he reads as a caricature to me.

        I agree that the story doesn't do Lewis justice. I actually think that even though most of us disagree with his views on religion, a lot of his work is worth reading because, surprisingly enough, it often deals with biases, the ways we deceive ourselves and other things rationalists like to talk about.
