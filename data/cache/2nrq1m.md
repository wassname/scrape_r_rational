  I'm trying to figure out how the hell Harry does anything from here.

  I mean, I assume Quirrelmort makes sure that the wizard side wins the Muggle War through use of some plot or another, but everything is occurring on a level that seems much above that which Harry is capable of operating on without Quirrel's help, as he had in Azkaban or some of his other escapades.

  Many of his already revealed powers have either been rendered obsolete, or eclipsed by other things, and everything has escalated incredibly quickly to the point where he either needs a lot more information and power, really fast, or he's going to become functionally irrelevant.
