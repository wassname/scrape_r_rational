## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  Been skimming through Azarinth Healer. It's probably going to be my absolute go-to for a story where technical skill (in terms of writing) is largely absent but it's still mostly readable as popcorn.

  Wouldn't rec for anyone looking for a rational work specifically. Actively anti-rec, in fact.

    It's about the purest "numbers go up" LitRPG I can think of. I do wish it would branch out a little with the character voices though. The sheer number of repetitions of a snarky/sarcastic male-identifying companion being brought on a tour of everywhere the protagonist has visited to that point is getting a little old. 

    You could snip entire back-and-forths between her and the former-dagger/former-king/Meadow/elf-dragon, then mad-lib the power references to match the flavour of her current companion, and it'd be very hard to tell which of the tours the material came from. Throw in the pirate, the curse-elf, and the fire-fox for shorter sequences of the same template.

    Not rational, not particularly good, and my absolute guilty pleasure at the same time.

    I think I couldn't binge it, but reading 4 chapters a week nicky balances my need for nonsense with all my other reading

- u/Smartjedi:

  I've recently been enjoying a lot of smaller scale works, and one thing I noticed a lot of these stories share is that they take place within one set location. 

  Think Fall of the House of Usher or the thriller-suspense movie Hush. All the suspense and action is tied into one house. 

  I've been trying to think of other works that do this and for the most part I keep reverting back to horror/suspense. I understand the reasons for why that story telling mechanic is so useful here, but surely there are other genres that make good use of this too right?

  Some of my favorite parts of long running series certainly have aspects of this during a climatic arc but then its back to traveling the nation/world/etc.

  So anybody know of any work that prominently features one set location? Doesn't matter the genre or medium, just ask that it be something you would actually recommend as good. Something in a rational/rationalist vein would be a plus but not necessary. 

  Some other examples off the top of my head that I've enjoyed:

  * Fly - Breaking bad episode that's just in one room
  * Breakfast Club
  * Source Code - which actually if anyone else knows of groundhog day stuff that's very small scale like this that'd be great.
  ```

  - u/None:

    A couple movies off the top of my head:

    12 Angry Men: Pretty rational, and a very good classic

    Clue (1985): Not rational, but fun and entertaining
    ```

    - u/heliosforselene:
      ```
      clue really is a fun one. def watch this for a good time
      ```

  - u/BavarianBarbarian_:
    ```
    Knives Out - the house it takes place in is basically a side character
    ```

  - u/WarZealot92:
    ```
    Obvious recommendation of The Man from Earth. The whole movie is just people talking within one room.
    ```

    - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
      ```
      Does Dr. Strangelove count? Three subplots in as many locations.
      ```

  - u/sunshine_cata:
    ```
    The single important location is a big feature of gothic novels, and books influenced by them.

    If you've never read titus groan or the gormenghast books, I highly recommend them.
    ```

  - u/tjhance:
    ```
    *10 Cloverfield Lane* is a good one, highly recommend
    ```

  - u/walruz:
    ```
    * The Cabin at the End of the World (short novel): A (gay, but I don’t really think that matters) couple and their daughter gets unexpected visitors in the form of four very odd home invaders. The entire book is basically a hostage negotiation. 5/5 and while maybe not a central example of “rational fiction”, is scratches many of the same itches.

    * Phonebooth (movie): Colin Farrel answers a ringing phonebooth. The caller is the sniper trained at the phonebooth. The entire movie takes place in or around said phonebooth.

    * Buried (movie): Ryan Reynolds is buried alive by insurgents while working as a contractor in Afghanistan. The movie is basically all dialogue, with close up shots of Reynolds’ face lit up by a phone screen.

    * Alien (movie): The crew of a space freighter respond to a distress call and picks up, well, you guessed it.

    * Cordyceps (written fiction; web original): Rat fic. The protagonist wakes up in a hospital (?) with memory loss, and the staff won’t tell him why he’s there, and certainly won’t tell him why a long-term acquaintance is in the next room. Lots of hypothesising about what’s going on and explicit explanations of the MC’s reasoning. Quite short, and one of the best pieces of web original fiction I’ve read.

    * Testimony Before an Emergency Session of the Naval Cephalopod Command (short story): This arguably counts as a single-location story since it is all testimony delivered at the titular session. Some cool ideas about how intelligence relates to theory of mind. (If you liked Peter Watts’ Blindsight you’ll probably like this as well).

    * I Identify Sexually as an Attack Helicopter (short story): A short story published in Clarkesworld maybe a year back, but has since been scrubbed from most places because some assholes who didn’t read it decided it was anti-trans. It takes place in the cockpit of an attack helicopter (who’d have thought), and explores what the famous meme would actually mean in practice: What would it *actually* entail to sexually identify as an attack helicopter? I’m still not sure I agree with the author’s implicit assertion that it is even meaningful to sexually identify as something orthogonal to the man-woman spectrum, but after reading it I was certainly less sure than i was before.

    * The Test by Sylvain Neuvel (novella): A recent immigrant to the UK is taking a citizenship test when masked gunmen occupy the classroom. Entirely contained within a few rooms, and contains a bunch of rationalist tropes (questions like “Given this information, what is the likely state of the world?”).

    There's a movie called Phone Booth, and this is its whole conceit. I enjoyed it. Wouldn't say it was rational but it was interesting. It's also a thriller.
    ```

  - u/MayMaybeMaybeline:
    ```
    [The Booth at the End](https://tubitv.com/series/4581/the-booth-at-the-end) is a short show about a mysterious man offering people faustian bargains, which takes place entirely in a single booth of a diner. It's been a while since I watched it, but I vaguely remember enjoying it.

    ```
    If you're talking small-scale small-location Groundhog Day stuff, the movie Groundhog Day itself is really good for that. But also the new movie Palm Springs is a really good time loop story that does so much more in a subgenre that tends to be pretty unoriginal at least in the early parts. It does some things that may annoy rational fiction fans though, if I recall correctly.

    The movie Ready or Not is also a really good single-location story.
    ```

    - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
      ```
      Speaking of time loops, I found Happy Death Day to be a lot of fun. It's got the exact kind of mood you'd expect from "time loop but it's a slasher teen horror", but executes on that premise perfectly well. It's a typical knows-what-it-is-and-doesn't-try-to-be-more piece of competent entertainment.
      ```

  - u/ivory12:
    ```
    The classic bottle episode. Like already said, *12 Angry Men* is required movie-watching. It's not perfectly rational, but it's just damn good. 

    More contemporary: Tom Hardy as *Locke* chronicles a guy driving a car one night and the phone calls he makes (to his subordinates, wife, and mistress). A whole movie carried by Hardy's acting, basically, and I think it was a good time-killer. 

    Closer to horror-movie territory is the cult classic *Cube*, featuring the eponymous murder room. Also in the 'strangers wake up in a strange place and things happen there' genre: *Circle* (2015) which was . . . okay. 

    It's probably not relevant as a recommendation, but Luigi's Mansion is a great Gamecube game featuring the titular mansion. It can be emulated onto Dolphin if you've, ah, 'lost' your own copy in the past ;)

    Oh, just remembered another one, [Gone Home](https://store.steampowered.com/app/232430/Gone_Home/) is a walking sim that takes place inside your family's house. You come back from college to find that no one's home. While trying to find out where everyone's gone, you explore the place and piece together the story. Creepy atmosphere, but no jumpscares.
    ```

  - u/fljared:
    ```
    Circle- A movie in which people wake up standing in a circle in a room and must choose one person to die every few mintues. All of it is talking and dealing with the situation they're in.
    ```

  - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
    ```
    I second “12 Angry Men”, great movie. For another example of single location movie that’s not actually a horror, there’s “Carnage”. “Destination wedding” is a weird case in that it’s relatively limited in locations, but it’s a lot more limited in cast. The whole movie is just Keanu Reeves and Wynona Rider cynically quipping at each other. You may love or utterly despise that.

    Honourable mention for a comedy example: the half episode “Nothing to room” from the anime show “Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt” is literally all a single shot of a couch.

    Predestination varies geographically and chronologically but feels small due to the focus on a small set of main characters. It's also an excellent and engaging movie.

  The most recent chapters of *[Nanocultivation Chronicles: Trials of Lilijoy](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/28254/nanocultivation-chronicles-trials-of-lilijoy)* have been focused a lot on what can or might be capable of thinking, and what that might mean (in addition to a bunch of plot going on). In particular the sort of shape the whole of (their) human society forms and how that might be a thinking thing independent of the humans that make it up, to some degree. Does anyone have any recommendations for works that explore similar ideas? Stuff like :

  * fractal intelligences where the sub-parts are themselves intelligent (e.g. what sort of minds are formed by human organization)
  * thoughts that think themselves 
  * environments that are fertile ground for producing things that think
  * the nature of conscious thought
  * what a "self" even is

  The only other thing that really comes to mind is Nighzmarquls' excellent *[Onward To Providence](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/34353/onward-to-providence)* ([SB](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/onward-to-providence-original-fiction.616857/)) ([SV](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/onward-to-providence-original-fiction.45926/)) which *definitely* covers some of this ground, with things like the character who is actually a micro-polity made up of a market of individual agents bidding on things, cultures that are capable of flirting (like, the whole culture, not the members of it) with characters who are actually able to reciprocate, or beings that are mostly or entirely made up of information and have to continuously think themselves into existence.

  - u/BavarianBarbarian_:
    ```
    Wildbow's [Pale](https://palewebserial.wordpress.com/about/) has some truly fascinating ideas about consciousness. Within the first arc, there's a Ritual Incarnate, which is basically a sentient lethal "game" that self-propagates by drawing in new people. Other examples include the Forest Ribbon Trail, which is part of the Paths, a realm partially made up of the collective human dreamscape; the Callers of City Spirits, people who work with the incarnation of an entire city; a Dog of War, which is an animus (human-shaped thing) that naturally emerges in mass casualty events and is spiritually made up from fragments of the dead, evolving with every human it kills; a Ghoul inhabiting a casette player that feeds on abandoned children who died of medical causes after basically being their last friend; the ability to cut away parts of your human Self, Soul, and Spirit to make yourself into something more than human; and Cig, a sentient (?) cigarette that only communicates with the rest of the world by burning holes into a map to indicate intruders.

    The story approaches the question of "how much can we call this sentient" from the angle of "hey doesn't that... thing... deserve rights as well?" because the entire world is really really cut-throat and most Practitioners don't think anything about summoning and enslaving Others, which our main protagonists are much more sceptical of.

        Replied with more details [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/l4phqe/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/gkt0q7c/). TL;DR it's good, less dark and more fun.
        ```

    - u/xachariah:
      ```
      Man, that stuff sounds dark.  Wasn't this supposed to be the more whimsical urban fantasy one, more Harry Potter take on Pact?

      I dropped Pact because it was such a bleak slog, and was hesitant to pick this up because of that.
      ```

      - u/BavarianBarbarian_:
        ```
        I dunno what the other guy is about. Pale has rather dark moments, like all of Wildbow's stories so far, but in total it's less dark. 

        Pact spoilers: >!Blake was often alone and had no one to depend on for most of the story. Even the people who he should have been able to depend on were often set against him by circumstances (an effect of his seven generations' worth of bad karma).!< The three protagonists from Pale don't have that problem; they awakened as a trio, and therefore the world itself is invested in keeping them together. There's arguments between them, but they're usually of the "You're doing this thing we all agreed is bad for you, you're worrying us" angle. Also they're thirteen, there's lots of moments where they're just... being kids having fun playing with cool magic.

        If you want a low-spoilers look at the limit of how dark Pale gets, you can read [Interlude 1.Z](https://palewebserial.wordpress.com/2020/06/06/lost-for-words-1-z/), that's pretty much the biggest gut-punch we've gotten so far.

    Your request has a certain qualia quality to it, so I'm not certain I fully grasp what you're looking for.

    * try asking [the SCP community,](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/SCPFoundation) there's no way there aren't at least half a dozen SCP sketches somewhere out there that fit your description (esp. among the memetics-tagged ones).
    * [*Blood Crest*](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10629488/1/Blood-Crest) — has in-depth magical theory on the setting-specific flavour of soul magic and nature of consciousness / self.
    * one of the later [*Thursday Next*](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThursdayNext) books featured an antagonist that was capable of infecting minds of others with a sub-copy of her own mind.
    * (IIRC) in [*the Sacrifices Arc*](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/ArcOfSacrifices) large concentrations of magic became pseudo-sentient, developed instincts, etc. The series also featured artefacts that allowed literally cutting away connections to other people, patterns / prophecies as semi-sentient magical entites, etc.

  I just read [InterWorld](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/47701.InterWorld), by M. Reaves and N. Gaiman. 

  Honestly, it's not all that great or rational, pretty typical YA stuff, but ten years ago I would've loved it. Multiverse, science, magic, all the big words like "Singularity", "Möbius strip", "Klein Bottle", conscious-centric interpretation of the quantum uncertainty principle - and it's used to tell the story of a boy who joins a multi-dimensional organization of his alt-world doppelgängers who fight against two armies that try and force the entire multiverse under either a scientific or a magical paradigm. I would've loved it if they'd *done something* with that "versions of this boy exist in every universe, no matter its underlying metaphysical/magical principles". Stuff like explore how their different upbringings shaped them. Stuff like have some of them join the magic-fascist army, or the tech fascist army. Or I dunno, use the different alt-versions of him to externalize some kind of conflict within him. Or have some kind of conflict with how some versions of him are male and others female. I dunno, I just feel the way it was used kinda wasted the potential that format had.

  And maybe that happens in the other parts of the series, but right now I'm not feeling like investing the time to find out.

  As it stands, the book is good popcorn reading, but not really a must-read. Gaiman's other works that I've read or experienced, namely Good Omens and American Gods, stand head and shoulders above this one.

  I binged The Dragoneye Moons (https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/36299/beneath-the-dragoneye-moons) this past weekend. I liked it! The MC is about as rational as you can expect, given that she's got the body of a kid, which is to say she knows herself pretty well and seeks her own best future and best self... and mangos. And flying, and fireballs, and healing people, and mangos, and long hot baths, and definitely mangos.

  I like the setting and the system well enough, and I like the other characters quite a bit. The author does a good job with team dynamics, banter, and friendships/working relationships in general.

  Also, there's a wicked sick elements mandala.

  - u/GlueBoy:
    ```
    Someone pointed out in reviews that the story doesn't adequately show why the society would be sexist, that it's handwaived away because the author wants to write about sexism. Do you agree?
    ```

    - u/PastafarianGames:
      ```
      Eh, no, I don't agree. I'll give three reasons:

      1 - The population pressure argument made in-setting (that is, women held as second class citizens as a measure to maintain high population growth).

      2 - It could just be arbitrary; if such an arbitrary thing grew (and it could, even with zero merit) it could calcify.

      3 - There could still be biological gender differences (though obviously miniscule compared to the stat differences of Classers). Children will have their initial attitudes towards gender influenced by their pre-unlock experience, and maintain that at least subconsciously.

      None of these reasons is commanding, but none of these reasons is bullshit, and the first one is offered explicitly in-text.

      That said, even if the reason were purely Doylist, it would be unlikely to lower my opinion of the story. Sometimes people want to write about a thing, and that's fine.
      ```

      - u/GlueBoy:
        ```
        > even if the reason were purely Doylist, it would be unlikely to lower my opinion of the story. Sometimes people want to write about a thing, and that's fine.

        I agree in theory, but in practice I find it means the author hasn't put much thought into the topic, doesn't care to understand it holistically. Or worse, has nothing interesting to say about it, beyond the cultural normative.
        ```

        - u/Selkie_Love:
          ```
          See, I have a thousand reasons why it exists in the setting - and it makes a ton of sense - the issue is, I have NO WAY of getting that information to the protagonist! Gender studies aren't a thing! Anyone she asks about it would say "That's the way things are."

          I'm writing a 1st person limited POV, so I literally can't get information to the reader that the protagonist doesn't know. I've thought long and hard on it, and have dozens of different ways and interlocking pieces for the existence of sexism in the setting, but again - without being able to get that information to the MC, there's no way to show it to the reader.
          ```

      - u/Flashbunny:
        ```
        Having read through the story, I have to agree that there's not really a good reason for it to exist. An argument could be made that women would tend towards less dangerous jobs, but that wouldn't be nearly enough to make them second-class citizens the way they are here.

        (As a side-note, before puberty there are no real differences in strength due to gender - it's quite common for a girl to be stronger than a boy.)

        It's been a constant minor irritant in an otherwise excellent story, which is a shame. I give it 4 stars, with the recommendation that people who are worried about it push on through the early parts where it looks like it's going to affect the protagonist more than it does for [reasons].
        ```

        - u/FunkyFunker:
          ```
          It exists because the setting is heavily based off of ancient Rome, mixed with MTG's Ixalan. The patriarchy is 'justified' by the strict caste system, the martial culture, the effect of high vitality on incumbent lifespans, and the lack of human planetary domination that would allow greater social development. Besides the issue of 'high mortality rate = strong cultural pressure into motherhood roles,' there are plenty of plain old social reasons that some people would want to, given the opportunity, oppress others for their own benefit.

          I think it really adds to the story and the theme of freedom vs obligation. Also, overall, the author has greatly toned down the level of sexism that would be present in such a setting. The MC encounters quite a disproportionate number of 'enlightened heroes' who just so happen to have more egalitarian mindsets for the setting, likely because the story would just be too grim otherwise.
          ```

          - u/Flashbunny:
            ```
            I can see how it would have stayed in place after it was established, even without the large IRL disparity in physical strength, but I just don't see how it could have come to exist in the first place. It being based on places or settings with such views is a Doylist reason, not a Watsonian one, and is on the same level as "because the author wanted to write about this" - believable, but not really sufficient for worldbuilding.
            ```

            - u/FunkyFunker:
              ```
              Literally just pregnancy. In a violent, high mortality world, many women of a successful 'tribe' would spend a significant amount of their time physically weakened and in need of protection just to meet the rate of replacement. They would naturally have fewer combat capabilities just from spending less time fighting and more time producing new 'tribe' members. It would be human nature for at least some of the men of such tribes to take such an opportunity to hoard power.

              The idea that a patriarchy emerging is somehow unrealistic given a fantasy world with an inherently hierarchical system of magic seems a strange conclusion to me. Ultimately, we don't even know all the lore, and we haven't seen anything that makes a patriarchy particularly less likely, either.

  I'm throwing in a strong rec for [He who fights with monsters](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26294/he-who-fights-with-monsters). not because it is the best out there, but because I had read a few reviews for it which discouraged me from reading the work which turned out to be **completely wrong.** 

  1. Setting aside how rational the story is its bloody **rationalist!!!** I couldn't believe that I hadn't seen a rec for this here. The MC is (in his own words) "very good at people" (specifically, not good **with** people but **at** people), and the perspective is from a social rationalist (someone who understands and approaches social interactions from a rational perspective). I have personally learnt a lot about social interactions from this story. 

  2. From a review: "The MC stupidly stays an atheist when there are gods in-front of him." This really tuned me off, because I remember another Isekai story I read in the past which I got completely turned off of when the MC said "I never understood how people on earth could deny the truth \[being Christianity in this case\]". Being Isekaied is irrefutable proof that your religion (as you believed it) is completely wrong, its just so petty for an author to add a line like that I couldn't believe it XD. I assumed this was the same thing but for atheism, until I read it and its completely the wrong impression; the MC doesn't stay atheist, he stays principled against the very idea of religion (worshiping someone by virtue of their birth not actions). This perspective is completely reasonable and IMO exactly what many in this community would enjoy. 

  3. Various reviews talking about inconsistencies: From what I read so far (chapter 200) I can't think of any glaring plot holes or unrealistic actions anyone has took really, maybe a little stretching to fit in the overall plot but IMO as good a quality as later chapters of MoL and better than Azarinth healer. 

  4. Various reviews not liking the MC cos he is pretentious, (comes off as a closet Atheist) etc. He is pretentious, but to me his interactions are believable (and I'd be happy to discuss this) and IMHO I suspect most people put off by him are religious people for obvious reasons (his philosophy is directly antithetical to religion) which colors their opinion. 

  So, if you haven't tried it because you saw some negative reviews, I recommend you give it a go. Its not perfect or like super incredible but I would say may appeal to this community more than the layman.

    I just stopped reading because there were way too many skills with way too many people so the actions scenes were a huge pain to read while trying to keep track of them.

      Yeah, the guy created an MMO-depth system, only with random skills instead of a skill tree. Of all the lame things in this story, that's the worst. 

      * Each "essence magician"(universally lame naming btw) has 4 essences, and each essence has 5 skills. 
      * Each skill gets an additional effect every time you levels up.
      * At the second level, bronze, an essence magician would have 20 skills with 40 possible effects. 

      How do you keep track of that AND maintain an interesting narrative with decent pacing? The answer is you don't. Because such a complex system doesn't leave a lot of room for intricacy and depth, it's too much for a reader to handle. So naturally what ends up happening is that despite having dozens of skills, every character is necessarily reduced to a single archetype just like in a system with 10x less details. Just look at Farrah for an example: she has 20 skills with 60 effects, but in combat she's just a glass cannon that spews lava. That's what every character is, in the end. 

      Add to that: 

      * what skills you get are random(!!).
      * you can't learn additional skills, or spells, or anything magical except for rituals. Those 20 random skills are what you have for the rest of your life. 
      * You can't change any skills you do get. It's been mentioned that if you get a deleterious skill, something that harms you or doesn't synergize with your kit, you're shit out of luck. 
      * You have to level each skill individually, and every skill must be leveled in order to rank up
      * You feed yourself with... coins? iron, bronze, silver, gold, diamond coins. Why that (modern) arrangement of value? Essences are supposedly a natural part of the world since time immemorial, so Iron was more valuable and rare than bronze until relatively recently, so how does that work? Oh, and diamonds are much more common than anything except iron? And bronze is an alloy and not a natural metal? 

      The whole thing is sloppily gamified, bad worldbuilding on bad worldbuidling. Even though it's not a bad story, per se, it leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

        That’s one thing I really don’t like about RoyalRoad litrpgs, and a lot of litrpgs in general. A lot of them use completely incomprehensible game Systems that just don’t work or make sense. And then they also don’t fit into the worldbuilding of the story and create a lot of plot holes.

        It’s a rare litrpg series that has a System that actually makes sense and is enjoyable to read about, actually manages to have it make sense in the scope of the world and universe, and to finally make the story enjoyable. Virtually all litrpgs I’ve read always manage to fuck at least one of these aspects up.

        - u/GlueBoy:
          ```
          I honestly think that's why litrpg is booming so much as a genre. People can write a fantasy story with a magic system lifted straight out of their favorite game or whatever. No thinking required.
          ```

        - u/dinoseen:
          ```
          It's worth noting that there isn't actually a System in this story, the protag just has a power that presents real information in that manner.

            I feel you're missing one element of why litrpgs are common, which is that they are basically a crutch for inexperienced or mediocre writers.  They're an easy hook for readers with the leveling up aspect, while stats and magic and skills take away the difficulty of combat scenes - why did Steve win the fight? He used his punch skill. Done. I think that's why a lot of litrpgs gradually put less and less emphasis on the system as time goes by, since they become confident to write without blue boxes detailing exactly what happened.

      An analogy I saw someone use about the first part of this story:"jason is that aggressively shit-talking short skinny kid you can't do anything about because his friends are jacked". 

      But it's worse than that, because their society is structured based on personal strength, might makes right. Nations are usually autocracies, ruled by golds and diamonds, and the few institutions that aren't parochial are still led by individuals based on their power level first and foremost. 

      So maybe it's like "if a white belt(jason) constantly ran his mouth off at a bunch of black belt regional champions(silvers) and they just let him because his friend's parents are lawyers". Doesn't really make sense.

      >He also is supposed to be a social rationalist, but never runs into opposition socially. People incredibly more important than you don't angrily engage until you trick or convince them, they have their flunkies shut you up, then throw you in prison, or otherwise destroy you. 

      In general they'll just ignore you. They wouldn't engage him in any form of dialog. If he showed up to their house to 'talk' they'd just have the servants tell him they are indisposed / out or busy.

      &#x200B;

      Sure if he talks too much crap he might get beat up, or have his fingers broken or worse depending on how bad the situation is and how nice the target of his criticism is.

    Acutally, I mentioned it [last week](https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/kzw82j/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/gjqdjkr/?context=3), and it has been mentioned several times on the Monday threads.

    I still keep up with it, but the side characters are more bearable to me than the main character. I still root for him, insofar as you'd root for the protagonist to win, but I'm not really as enthralled with him as I used to be in the first few chapters. A part of that is because of his pretentious, holier-than-thou attitude about his philosophy. It's not wrong per se, but it's also not compelling after the 15th time he goes off on a tirade. In a world of characters that are mostly believable, he comes off like a caricature, or a manchild, or both. Yeah, I get that deep inside he's really mature and that his behavior is a facade and whatnot, but maybe that's just something I don't find enjoyable in a character. He's sorta like Shallan in Stormlight Archives in that way. He has a defining character trait that is done... alright I guess. But when it's not great it's really irritating to read about.
    ```

    - u/Dragfie:
      ```
      I think this criticism is warranted, but with the caveat that (at least at the beginning) he does get called out on this. I think if one of his rants were interrupted that would add a lot more realism to his monologuing. But so far; binging up to chapter 200, I haven't been put off by this yet so still don't recommend prospective readers to give it a pass for this reason.

      Ever since the MC >!came back to Earth!< I feel like the author tried to shove Joker and Batman into a single character. It just doesn't work for me.
      ```

  - u/WarZealot92:
    ```
    While I second this recommendation, I do it with the caveat that in my head canon the story **ends** with with the first book. As much as I liked the story until >!he died and got resurrected back on Earth!<, everything after that I can only describe as terrible. 

    And by everything, I mean everything. The worldbuilding, the characters, the pacing - if it wasn't for the familiar smugness of the main character, I would honestly wonder whether it is still the same person writing the story. I kept reading by inertia for a while, but finally dropped the story a couple of months back.

    - u/Do_Not_Go_In_There:

      Yeah, it was definitely disappointing to see to story start to become bogged down with too much drama.

      I stopped reading a few weeks ago, because nobody aside from the MC is capable of making smart decisions without his input.

    Eh. I'm still reading it, but I got to a recent point where, yet again, there was a third-party interlude where people go "well he seems powerful and dangerous yet somewhat reasonable. I guess we better not piss him off, at all" -- for like the 8th time. And it just... the blatant power fantasy was showing through a bit strongly and it was offputting. Still following the updates intermittently, but I don't rate it nearly as highly as I used to.

  Does anyone know any well put together alt-history stories?  Preferable pre-colonial period.

    Harry turtledove and SM sterling are two of my favorite alt history authors. 

    I particularly loved Turtledoves darkness series [here](https://www.amazon.com/Into-Darkness-Harry-Turtledove/dp/0765383314) which was a alt history of WWII with a scientific magical system which takes the place of technology. It's executed well and works better than it sounds. He also wrote Guns of the South and many other alt history books. 

    SM sterling wrote [island in a sea of time](https://www.amazon.com/Island-Sea-Time-S-Stirling/dp/0451456750) which is quite good and ends up in the ancient world which may satisfy your desire for pre colonial alt history. He also wrote Dies the Fire and the Novels of the Change. Modern tech fails due to an apparent change in the physical rules of combustion leading to chaos and disaster. Communities struggle to survive and merge old technology with modern understanding to create something new and unique. The first several books of the series were excellent but I dropped them around the 5th book as the introduction of magic was not handled well in my opinion.

    I also enjoyed the ~~Years of Rice and Salt~~ [Peshawar Lancers](https://www.amazon.com/Peshawar-Lancers-S-M-Stirling/dp/0451458737) in which a meteor shower led to a temporary ice age around the height of the british empire. This leads to widespread starvation and a regress in technology. The book is set a couple decades after the fall as society begins to stabilize and recover. The regress in technology and setting in India give it a different cultural feel that may satisfy your desire for a pre colonial period setting despite it being set in a byproduct of colonialism.

    Hope you enjoy! If you happen to have any alt history you enjoy, I'd appreciate any recommendations you have.

    Not precolonial and kind of a weird alt-history but Twig by Wildbow is really good. The premise is that instead of the industrial revolution, there was a rapid increase in biological sciences resulting in wars being fought with Frankenstein monsters/plagues/chemical weapons/etc. The protagonist is a kid experiment on improving brain function that is focused on social manipulation

  Forty Millenniums of Cultivation.

  It's both extremely rational but also so "anti-munchkin"

  It's not just self-consistent but consistent with the way we see humans act irl.

  The author will go off on long but also genuinely interesting tangents.

  It will reexamine its own Nationalism/racism in a far more nuanced way than most other things.

  Y'know the trope where the MC has like some evil thing sealed in its head? MC has socratic dialogue with it, and like real socratic dialogue, not like "Don't do bad things" "No me like bad things"

  It's very rational, but it's also willing to accept dramatism and emotion as driving forces.

  Good takes on philosophy and ethics in general.

  Good subversion of the xianxia genre.

  Extremely likable protagonist and cast of characters
