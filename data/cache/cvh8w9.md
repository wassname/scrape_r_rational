For those who are unfamiliar with PB, it's a six-month-old dark fantasy serial set in a grim Near Eastern themed world where human civilization has had to adapt to an endless, unstoppable cycle of magical disasters.  A small-town boy leaves home to help his family make ends meet, only to get swept up in far weightier matters.

  Looks like the problem with male indwelt is an obsession with soup.

    Strictly speaking, he might have preferred an equal-temperature cauldron of something with a higher specific heat than water.  If you can come up with a plausible reason why they would have such a thing handy at that place, in that time, I might feel compelled to swap it in.

    EDIT: Possibly not, now that I think it over.  The interaction between physics and magic is a ticklish business.  I may have to ask my science consultant.

    SECOND EDIT: Science consultant (meaning "longsuffering friend of mine with a BS in Astronomy") confirms that a material with higher specific heat would have been more valuable.  Now I just need to find out why they'd have a giant pot of (consults Wiki's list of specific heat capacities) ammonia, I guess.

      Is it heat, or the symbolic and physical connection to the suns lifegiving energy? 

      That is, the fire burning wood, coming from trees, nurtured by the light of our sun, with the broth having plants grown under the suns light, both bringing a connection to the life giving properties that the pyre channels and the haranu (probably?) looks for?


      Plus the only alternative to food I could see would be clothes washing or something, and i am not sure that wash water would be hotter than soup.

    But only if it's hot. You'll notice he lost all interest when he realized the soup had gone cold :P

    I haven't read the chapter yet and I have no idea what this sentence could mean.

  Well that was almost smooth! Ram is starting to get good at the "everyone trying to kill you" game!

    Practice, practice, practice.

  Very solid chapter, always good to see what ram and the gang are up to
