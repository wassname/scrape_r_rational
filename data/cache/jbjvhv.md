## Looking for an obscure web short series "Outsider"

### Post:

I'm looking for a web short from around 2008 or 2009 (I am pretty sure), its story and themes would probably be of interest to this community. It is called "Outsider", and it was on youtube. I am pretty sure it was six episodes, and it was presented in the form of text being typed out on the screen.

it was about a person contacted by an alien post-singularity AI probe, which proved its power by reversing a cryptographic hash. it offered to give him knowledge from its society for mysterious reasons. eventually an agent from that society comes to track down the AI, apparently the probe was rogue and was not supposed to make contact with Earth. I can't remember any names of any of the characters. from what I can remember it was solidly rational, but probably not rationalist. the scifi aspects were semi-hard, and there were some singularity/uplift themes.

I am totally unable to locate it again, no matter what keywords I use or what search engine, so I am hoping someone here has also seen it and can help.

  I'm familiar with it. It's been linked to on this subreddit, [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/43zh8p/rst_outsider_ep_16_first_contact_visual_novel/)'s a past discussion thread.

  But it appears the videos have been taken down. I'm not sure if anyone has backups. Perhaps we should ask the author, u/danielrpa?

    Ah, you are awesome. thank you, also, for the author's handle. I figured the video might be gone, but it is good to know that I am not totally insane. still weird that I got the date so far off, maybe I was associating it with something else similar. also, I feel sort of dumb for not searching this sub first, though I had assumed it would be too old to reasonably find given my error with the dates.

  Hello all, thank you very much for the interest (and, wow, finding the original thread!). I had nothing but poor experiences with youtube due to the background music that played along the text. Constant nagging for copyright claims on music that was freely usable (even for commercial applications) AND for which I had permission from the author, to whom I even donated some money.

  That story was condensed to begin with. I need to revise it, find new music, but unfortunately life has made it hard for me to find the needed time. Covid didn't help either, which sounds counter-intuitive but true nonetheless. But worry not, I haven't forgotten about it!

  Thanks again!
