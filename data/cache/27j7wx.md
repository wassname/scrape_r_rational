  From the previous chapter's notes:

  > As a friendly warning, the next chapter is the one that makes me consider this story M-rated.

  An interesting definition of M-rated.

    Heh, that content got pushed to Chapter 7, in case anyone is wondering.
    ```

      I assumed as much, you might want to edit your note in 5, if you can.
      ```

- u/alexanderwales:
  ```
  Post any typos you might find here, if you please.
  ```

  - u/trifith:
    ```
    "I'm not artist myself" should be "I'm not an artist myself"

    "Public Works of Arts Project has runs its course" should be "Public Works of Arts Project has run its course"
    ```

    - u/alexanderwales:
      ```
      Fixed, thanks!
      ```

  - u/stringless:
    ```
    "building road and bridges" - roads

    "program has runs" - run

    "an oversized scissors" should probably include "pair of"

    I'm quite enjoying the story! And looking forward to Sunday's update.
    ```

    - u/alexanderwales:
      ```
      Fixed, thanks!
      ```

  - u/Pluvialis:
    ```
    "he done everything from funding legal efforts..." should be "**he'd** done everything..."
    ```

    - u/alexanderwales:
      ```
      Fixed, thanks!
      ```

- u/Timewinders:
  ```
  "He's sat down" should be "He'd". "Has runs its course" should be "has run". I'm not sure, but shouldn't "congress" be capitalized? "an oversized scissors" should be "an oversized pair of scissors". "You're too close to the story Clark" should probably have a comma.

  Definitely some interesting developments this time. Now that Luthor knows Clark Kent's identity, he has a major advantage. He could have him watched discreetly and figure out almost everything he needs to know about him.

  ```
  Rather than post spelling errors, I'd like to say, this is fast becoming my favourite web fiction, for the first time I'm enjoying the story of Superman, through the inconsistencies in his powers, the his lazy moral stance. Thanks and keep posting :).
  ```

- u/GeneralSCPatton:
  ```
  I wonder, have we already been presented with clear-cut evidence that Clark Kent is Superman, or are we going to get some kind of plot twist showcasing Luthor's, and the audience's, preconceptions? It would make for a pretty good mindscrew if we all just assumed because of canon, and were wrong.
