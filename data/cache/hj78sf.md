  So the solution to this whole conundrum is the fantasy version of [the Cadaver Synod,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadaver_Synod) now with 100% additional necromancy. Gotta be honest though, I still feel like something will go wrong. It's too easy for this plan to fall apart, be it people disproving of the necromancy or the existence of the T&T trial leaking to the Grand Assembly.

  Returning to the chapter as a whole though, I have to say that the trial was written quite well. It didn't drag on, yet all story points were addressed well and it still managed to be impactful.

    It's a vile act on one of Above's deceased. Hanno's punishment was done, and the thing Cat creates won't have a Name, so it's not a technical violation of the Terms. Still, the Heroes will all be revolted by it, and many may jump ship if they'll find out. Given that they're Heroes, and the Wandering Bard is about, you can bank on them finding out - when it's least convenient for Cat.

  I think the Bard is going to turn the Proceran civilian population against Hasenbach (through the many non-fighting support classes of Heroes - those who entertain, advise or teach, I'd surmise) and hasten the North-South split of the principate. The Red Axe is gonna be a convenient martyr for this cause.
