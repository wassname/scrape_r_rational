  ...She can generate enough electrical power for hundreds of thousands of people?

  Well, that raises my estimation of her threat levels by several orders of magnitude. I'd left her introductory chapter with the impression that she had a fairly low level of output, given scales involved in the potato example

    My current problem is figuring out how long it would take to build a series of successively better machines for performing these tests. At this point I've resigned myself to making some good guesses and finding out that one of my readers is an electrical engineer whose suspension of disbelief is going to crack any day now.

    She doesn't know her upper limit, but she has a very fine control over her output.

    That's a great name. Have some [nuclear war cookies](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/2e/df/c0/2edfc042a84f488ddb80202c79a9e5f4.jpg).
