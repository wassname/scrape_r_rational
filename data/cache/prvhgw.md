## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  Last week, someone mentioned https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/42367/12-miles-below , I second that recommendation, I binged it yesterday and I loved it. 

  Growing up my favourite book series was Dune and while it's quite different, I do agree with the person recommending it in seeing the influence. I do have to say that I really disliked the main character initially, luckily the world building and prose kept me interested and I really appreciated the character growth.

    Same here - binged it and loved it.

    * The combination of high tech, scavenging, and feudalism is delicious.
    * The post-apocalypse frozen Earth, guarded by satellite "gods" with ancient, subterranean ruins also has enormous appeal.
    * Highly rational protagonist and setting with lots of shout-outs to modern information technology.
    * No shortage of ass-kicking, either.
    * Enemies are horrifying weapons of terror.
    ```

    Second this rec. I really like sci-fi stories with anachronistic culture, a deep and mysterious history and lots of old ruins and relics. Revenger by Alastair Reynolds is another example, and the stunning Iron Empires comics by Christopher Moeller.
    ```

    - u/tomtan:
      ```
      Similarly, one of my favorite game in the past few years is Horizon Zero Dawn which really scratches the same itch.
      ```

  - u/Revlar:
    ```
    I liked it up until the point at which things stopped looking dire, which severely undercut my enjoyment once it happened. There just wasn't any reason left for me to care about the protagonist once they were no longer in that dangerous situation (and seemingly no longer in need of character development).
    ```

    Perhaps not me, but I'll totally take the credit anyway for the rec xD

  I can't find the source now, but I am pretty sure this community recommended "[Unwitting Champion](https://manmagnificent.wordpress.com/about/)" at some point and got me on it. I've caught up to the current chapter and my response is... eh. It's middle of the road. I've put it down for now, but I may go back in a few months when more is out and see what's come of it. Quick thoughts...

  I enjoy that the protagonist is from a different background than most isekai (South African black kid), and there looks to be some good drama being set up where the protagonist is becoming aware that he's being used to prop up a medieval system where slavery is a common occurrence. The story touches on racism, classism, and gender identity, though it's not really explored deeply. But the protagonist is a little frustrating and dithers around quite a bit until the more recent chapters. He's kind of got an alternate-personality thing going on recently which... I get that the author is using it to show the inner conflicts he's dealing with, but it just kinda comes off as having a little devil on his shoulder rather than him working through his cognitive dissonance. There is fairly little action so far, which normally isn't bad because I like plots with politics involved, but a lot of the chapters feel like exposition to help build up the world. And the worldbuilding does hold promise, with a magic system based on gems (mostly) and a fairly robust geopolitical landscape. But so far the promise hasn't paid dividends, so I'm still in a wait-and-see phase.

  Also, the author really needs a copy editor or to go back and fix some of the spelling and grammar. There are enough that it's obvious and feels sloppy.

  Anyway, as said, I give it a wishy-washy thumbs up. I enjoyed reading what was there enough to get to the current chapter, but it's not one I'll be watching for updates as they come out. I may go back several months down the line when I have nothing else to read.
  ```

  - u/Jokey665:
    ```
    Yeah this mostly echoes my thoughts about it. 

    I will say that more than most isekai I've consumed (which isn't a small amount, unfortunately lol) it made me actually think about the whole 'summoning random people from wherever' and how there's no real incentive to play along as the random unfortunate summon.
    ```

    - u/AurelianoTampa:
      ```
      >it made me actually think about the whole 'summoning random people from wherever' and how there's no real incentive to play along as the random unfortunate summon.

      I mean, I sorta felt the opposite before we started learning more about Rowan. Jordan DOES have real incentives to playing along - it is his only known way of returning to Earth. He keeps obsessing over escape but is missing the point that there's nowhere for him to escape to that would bring him back to Earth. Even now his escape obsession has just transitioned from "get out of the castle and away from these people!" to "get away from these people and meet up with Rowan,>! who may be from Earth!<!" Even if he is correct about Rowan's origins, there is absolutely no reason to think that Rowan >!knows a way back to Earth, considering he's apparently been around for decades at this point. If he knew how to get back home and wanted to do so... he would have!<.

      I mean, yeah, Rowan seems to be stirring up popular revolt and bringing democracy to a feudal society, which makes staying in the lands he owns a lot more palatable than hanging out with the entrenched nobility, but if his ultimate goal is getting back to Earth, his constant desire to escape isn't going to help him get to that point. He'll have nothing to barter with, no knowledge to trade, and he'll stick out like a sore thumb. Even if a group other than the spatial mages know how to send him home, no one's going to do so out of the goodness of their hearts - especially since even basic teleportation spells seem to be monstrously expensive (needing a 10 story tall monolith and a full team of mages to teleport a small group a short distance). Even if the kingdom's enemies want to deprive the royalty of their champion, it's much easier to just kill Jordan than to work to send him home.

      So it seems to me that Jordan's best bet ***is*** to play along as the random unfortunate summon, at least until he learns enough of the world to find a viable alternative to get home. Nothing he's learned about Rowan has suggested that he knows how to do that. He's shooting himself in the foot by trying to escape, trading his long-term goal of returning to Earth for the short-term moral comfort of leaving a slave-owned feudal society. And for a guy who is so vehemently being used as a war prop and terrified of being killed in battle, planning an escape *toward* a war-entangled populist revolution seems ack-basswards. 

      Sorry, this was longer than I intended. TL;DR: Jordan has a very good incentive to play along if he wants to get back home, but he's so obsessed with escaping the frying pan that he seems oblivious that he is jumping into a fire. He annoys me, haha.
      ```

      - u/Revlar:
        ```
        Jordan actually has good reason to seek out Rowan, because the reason Rowan is so dangerous to the status quo in the first place is that he has the ability to create the magical conditions previously thought to only be geographical that the kingdom Jordan is summoned to claims are required to send him back. I don't remember the exact name off the top of my head, but it was something to do with mana wells/leylines. I might need to reread.

        In the most recent chapter, there's also some important revelations that cast doubt on the kingdom's ability to send him back, if that's even possible.
        ```

- u/Anderkent:
  ```
  I'm not sure if it was recommended here previously, or if I picked it up somewhere else; in any case [The Last Ship in Suzhou](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/41852/the-last-ship-in-suzhou) has been amazing so far. A xianxia-inspired isekai story with a twist; the writing so far has been superb, with characterisation at the level of a professional writer if not above. The mood of the story is fairly calm and contemplative, but at the same time the pacing is quite healthy.

  I'm not sure if it's rational, strictly, but I think it will appeal to many.
  ```

  - u/jiffyjuff:
    ```
    Seconded. Not generally a fan of xianxia, but this is impeccably written and the story is fascinating. But one thing I'd also like to draw attention to is the attention to linguistic and cultural detail.

    The work is full of real Chinese poetry and music, as well as some original pieces, which gives the work an genuine sense of authenticity. The treatment of language is also well considered: it's clear when the characters are speaking Chinese and English; it's not assumed that things that rhyme or cadence automatically transfer across; there are plots that acknowledge and depend on this. The author clearly knows their stuff. If you're a native Chinese speaker, you will definitely be pleasantly surprised (and also possibly get half-remembered flashbacks to Chinese class upon translating some familiar quotations in your head), and hopefully if you're not, you can still appreciate the attention to detail. The best way to look authentic to the unlearned eye is to just be authentic, after all.
    ```

    - u/jiffyjuff:
      ```
      Side note: the first interlude contains a boatload of new names which are actually Chinese historical figures. If you don't know them, the chapter may be difficult to follow. But as far as I can tell, the interlude appears to be entirely for flavor, to contextualise a piece of music played earlier, so don't worry too much about it.

      - u/jiffyjuff:

        I suppose that is accurate, because I am do not have much familiarity with the genre. Though I find most xianxia unbearable (Forge of Destiny was mind-numbing, and I've not been more than a few chapters into any other), but had a pleasant time with this one, so it must be doing something different, and I don't think it's just the prose.

  ```
  So a few days ago I found out about [The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect](http://localroger.com/prime-intellect/mopiidx.html), a sci-fi novella about a post-singularity world that's available for free on the internet and was written back in 1994. It's interesting in that it shares a lot of the common tropes and topics of rational fiction, despite predating the term by a long shot, enough that I'd have considered it a sort of ur-example of it... right until the ending. Non-specific spoilers: >!the ending REALLY left me perplexed. I'm not sure it's meant to be seen entirely as positive, but to me, while it does feel like a logical consequence of the viewpoint of at least one of the two MCs, it also feels awful. Like, positively terrible.!<

  More specific spoilers: >!while the flaws and problems with the post-singularity world are obvious, it's also clear that it's still relatively on the benign end of the possibilities. What happens at the ending however is that the protagonists effectively genocide all of humanity, and *then*, when one of them is understandably upset about this, the other basically goes "ah don't think about it, let's fuck and repopulate the Earth" and from then on we get a lot of primitivist nonsense in which somehow two people manage through the power of sex (and incest) to built up a whole tribe. Considering the imminent extinction due to excessive inbreeding, maybe the bit where the father has sex with his 14 years old daughter as a necessary rite of passage to spread his genes could have been avoided.!<

  So, yeah, it's not a full recommendation, but I guess it still makes for an interesting read? Just, go in with tempered expectations if you think it sounds interesting.

    This has been [recced](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2hmzzz/th_the_metamorphosis_of_prime_intellect_by_roger/) [before](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3dqwlm/the_prime_intellect_by_roger_williams/) No problem. Just wanted to link to the discussion (the critique is the same).

    Also perhaps read the authors [plans for book 2](http://localroger.com/prime-intellect/mopidnf.html) and other writing on his website. Might mitigate your problems with the ending...
    ```

    - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
      ```
      I like the interpretation that >!that's just PI fucking with them and going "ok, you want your own primitive world? I'll give you primitive". I still find it puzzling that Lawrence joins Caroline's efforts and doesn't fall into despair or commit suicide after the apparent reversal of the Change. Also, Caroline is a weird character. I'd get her reaching that apex of nihilism after enough time in the simulation. But that's not what happens. She's rejuvenated back from near death *and she immediately gets into her ennui*. Like, it should take some time for that to happen.!<

    Have you read the side story [A Casino Odyssey in Cyberspace](http://localroger.com/k5host/casodycs.html)? It expands a bit on the post-singularity economy and world with a lesser (though not non-existent) focus on the seamier stuff.

  I know this has been recommended here before, but I just read [Strong Female Protagonist](https://strongfemaleprotagonist.com/issue-1/page-0/) this week, and am strongly second-ing the rec.  I keep a tier list of everything I read/see, and I only find four or five new SS-tier entries every year.  This is one of them.  Personally, I'm calling it rational fiction.

  I also recommend reading u/timecubefanfiction's [review](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/oimzs9/honest_exploration_is_critical_exploration_how/) after you're done too, because it's very well written.

  Oh, and if you want to read it on mobile, the website's UI isn't the best, so I recommend reading it on [Tachiyomi](https://tachiyomi.org/)'s ReadComicOnline extension, which worked excellently for me (Consider this a recommendation for Tachiyomi too, for manga/comic reading). 

  Edit: The app only has until part 6 though, and the website has another part and a half.

      This year - Foundation, SFP, and two fanfictions (Rationalizing Death, and the latter books of the Rigel Black series - obvious flaws aside, it was more entertaining than most things I read).

      The entire lists (only TV has stuff from before this year):

      [TV](https://jozdien.notion.site/TV-943ad1486e11453b8dbc354d2802c25e)

      [Books](https://jozdien.notion.site/b1ab70c3842f4ee4bc2cdf1a7b512c28?v=db321247d9cf4c78abafcf4abac18cb7)

      [Graphic Novels / Manga](https://jozdien.notion.site/841471af50c441bd9afeccf8ae22bdea?v=5f187fb5fd5047bcae5d0fc28c787f48)

      [Fanfiction](https://jozdien.notion.site/1a5b49fbc86f40b9a4351290e81ad795?v=d839fc059c1f408b836e4e418b964d2c) (Following the Phoenix is also marked SS, but this was a re-read).

      If you asked because you want to see if you'd like SFP based on what else I've given the same rating, I'd advise putting a low weight on that.  Some of the stuff I give high ratings to are very YMMV, and some of the stuff because I watched it so long ago that I was happily blind to its faults.

    Tachiyomi finishes on book 6 and there is a book 7 and half of book 8

    What's going wrong there

    It also had the India short story in a completely different place

    Looking again at the archive it also was missing the fan art page and the break page I checked so now I worry that it was incomplete in more ways

    Edit: https://strongfemaleprotagonist.com/issue-5/newspaper/

    Missing this page!!!

    So while it's nice to browse and shows hover text for first book it's missing stuff so I wouldn't recommend reading that way

    Edit: https://strongfemaleprotagonist.com/issue-6/3367/ also this, I guess I could do through them both side by side to se the differences

    Thirding the SFP rec. It isn't perfect, but gosh darnit, a lot of ratfic isn't perfect. 

    I didn't know about Tachiyomi. That'll be very useful. 

    What's SS-tier?
    ```

    - u/netstack_:
      ```
      Comes from a videogame (possibly JRPG?) term of having D, C, B, A, and S ranks. Once you got to that point the only way to go was more SSSs, apparently. Though S is where most tier lists stop.
      ```

      - u/TREB0R:
        ```
        S stands for superlative and comes from a Japanese grading in school. S being superlative to the normal A, B, etc.
        ```

          ```
          I learned them from Naruto haha
          ```

    - u/Jose1561:
      ```
      Like u/netstack_ said, I got it from an old MMORPG I used to play years ago.  It went up to SSS, which is why mine does too.  No particular reason other than I thought it was cool when I saw that rating system in the game.
      ```

  - u/RMcD94:
    ```
    Do you know when SFP is due to finish
    ```

    - u/Jose1561:
      ```
      Nope, and given that the authors haven't given any updates in a couple years and are both busy with their other (also great) projects, I don't think it'll be anytime soon.
      ```

      - u/RMcD94:
        ```
        No update to the comic in several years or no update by them about the future? 

        If it's abandoned/on hiatus at a reasonable point then I might pick it up assuming it's unlikely to be finished but if it's in the middle of an arc eh
        ```

        - u/Jose1561:
          ```
          Both.  The last update was in 2018, if I remember correctly.  

          It stopped at a pretty reasonable point.  It doesn't feel like a conclusive ending to the story, and there are a few plot threads left hanging, but most of them are long-term, and not _very_ attached to personally driving the plot.  A decent analogy might be HPMOR and Harry trying to understand science / end all death?

          - u/RMcD94:

  First off, I'd like to recommend the [Scurry](https://www.scurrycomic.com/) webcomic. Worth reading on the strength of the art alone, and the writing is pretty decent too. Also, it's COMPLETE which is a huge deal for a webcomic.

  And inspired by /u/Jose1561, I'll post my lists of "all the things I've read/watched". AKA my  [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/82954187?sort=rating&view=reviews) and [MAL](https://myanimelist.net/profile/GaBeRockKing). And for good measure, here's a lightly curated list of "stuff I'm currently following that's updated within about 3 months or so that isn't fanfiction". (Ordered generally by last updated to most recently updated, with the exception of some rapidly updating stuff I read in batches.)

    Just note that Scurry has gorgeous art and the depth of a puddle. Still worth checking out, just don't go in with the wrong expectations.

  This may be old news for a lot of people, but James Gunn's *Suicide Squad* was better than I expected it to be, even after I adjusted my expectations upward in response to what I'd heard about it. 

  The pacing was good, the characterization was good, the visual design was consistently good, and >!the political angle was surprisingly good!<. I think that it overplays Harley Quinn, who's best when she has somebody to work off of, but it doesn't bring the movie down too much, and my other criticisms are mostly nitpicking.

    minor pedantry, but actually somewhat relevant in this case - the title you're looking for is *The Suicide Squad*, not to be confused with *Suicide Squad*

      Not at all. This is the first DC film I’ve seen since Shazam, and it was a good standalone film.

  Eliezer himself mentioned his work over on glowfic a few weeks ago I think, but for anyone who missed it, [but hurting people is wrong](https://glowfic.com/posts/4508) is fantastic, and [mad investor chaos and the woman of asmodeus](https://glowfic.com/posts/4582) has gotten really interesting lately.

    “But hurting people is wrong” is very good. Note that you scroll down and read the entire message-board-like format before clicking “next”.

    It’s a clash-of-cultures from a much more coordinated earth.

    I liked bhpiw, but I didn’t like where it ended.

    >!I really wanted to see past First Contact. The dath ilan worldbuilding at the end was cool though.!<

    - u/masterax2000:

      I agree, I hadn't even realized that was the end at first, it was only after looking through his other stories that I noticed the "completed" tag...

      Still, it's a fun ride while it lasts.

  I did not enjoy Squid Game from a rationalist perspective. It was cliché, lacking in verisimilitude (so much is incoherent or just shouts at you that it's a TV show), shallow thematically, filled with (if not plot holes) contrivances, and the characters are short sighted and show few signs of the thinking I would associate with rationalism.

  My housemate enjoyed it a lot, so if you can turn off your brain (and your history of watching TV) and like gore, it may be engaging and enjoyable for you.

  Any suggestions for good recent shorter fiction? Preferably less than 20k words, maybe up to short-novel length if it's particularly good. I've read the wiki and a few recent recommendations threads but most of the suggested stories are 100+ chapters long and I tend to give up well before getting to the end.

  Web fiction, professional fiction and fanfiction are all OK, realistic science fiction is generally my favorite but other genres are fine too. One other thing that seems to be popular around here but I'm not really a fan of is stories where the world literally runs on narrative tropes and/or RPG rules, so preferably avoid those if possible.

    If you have read worm theres great short fanfic stuff around? I believe [this one, 28 Taylors later](https://archiveofourown.org/works/7678162/chapters/17488978)   works well even if you don't know the source material.
    ```

    - u/kevin_p:
      ```
      Thanks for the suggestion! 

      I got about half way through Worm by chapter count before dropping it, probably a lot less than that by word count because the chapters were getting longer as the story went on.

        You can also find a ton of freely available SF stories here: https://www.freesfonline.net/

        Some I really like: 

        https://www.baen.com/Chapters/1932093025/1932093025___1.htm "The smartest mob" by David Brin 

        https://www.freesfonline.net/authors/Kij_Johnson.html -> start with "26 Monkeys, also the Abyss"

        https://www.freesfonline.net/authors/A.%20M._Dellamonica.html "The Silvering Herd"

        Also the incredible http://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/maneki-neko/ by Bruce Sterling.

          Thanks! I've used that site in the past but the quality is variable, some are great but others much less so. For the story suggestions I enjoyed Maneki Neko in the past so I'll check out the others too.

    Zero HP Lovecraft has some great short stories/novellas, but his politics are as problematic as his namesake, so be warned. 

    [short story example](https://zerohplovecraft.wordpress.com/2020/07/20/brief-interviews-with-hideous-bots/)

    [novella example](https://zerohplovecraft.wordpress.com/2018/05/11/the-gig-economy-2/)

    [the one with the emojis: Don't Make Me Think](https://zerohplovecraft.wordpress.com/2021/07/07/dont-make-me-think/)

    For something by someone less controversial, try [For the Taking](https://archiveofourown.org/works/9809486), a short story about summoning demons and the risks thereof.

    qntm also does short stories, his most famous is probably [I don't know, Timmy, being God is a big responsibility](https://qntm.org/responsibility); more recently there's the fantastic [Lena](https://qntm.org/mmacevedo).
    ```

      Thanks, great suggestions, although I'm already familiar with Qntm and ZHPL.

      Qntm is one of my favorite short-form SF writers, I read I Don't Know, Timmy a long time ago and it made a big impression on me. Parts of it stuck with me for years until I rediscovered it fairly recently - except for some reason I remembered it as them working out a way to translate any algorithm to O(1) rather than building an infinitely-powerful processor. 

      I hadn't heard of For The Taking though, I'll check that one out.
