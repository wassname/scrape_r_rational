  **In Russian, with no translations that I know of:**

  *Disclaimer: Rationality of the following work varies, but I do think that all of them contain ideas, themes, plots or plot points that people here may enjoy.*

  * Some works of Yuri Nesterenko arguably qualify.

   * [«Отчаяние»](http://fan.lib.ru/n/nesterenko_j_l/text_0830.shtml) (30k). Ontological Mystery: a person with no memory wakes up in an abandoned facility of some kind. Somewhat reminiscent of [*Cordyceps*](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4c24f8/hsfc_cordyceps_too_clever_for_their_own_good/), in my opinion. Warning: there are some extremely gruesome moments.

   * [«Абсолютное оружие»](https://royallib.com/book/nesterenko_yuriy/absolyutnoe_orugie.html) (30k), about a group of soldiers sent into jungles to save an archaeologist. The latter recently discovered new Mayan ruins...

  * SCP Objects and Tales.

   * [SCP-1001-RU - «Пустотная сингулярность»](http://scpfoundation.ru/scp-1001-ru) (4k). Very interesting concept.

   * [«Неудавшиеся скульпторы»](http://scpfoundation.ru/sculptors-who-failed) (17k). Collaborative work, essentially an analogue of our Saturday Munchkinry Threads. First person thinks up a human-based SCP: powers, goals, motivations. Second person writes how the Foundation ultimately defeated them (quality varies, obviously).

   * [«На игле прогресса»](http://scpfoundation.ru/scientific-rise-addiction) (1k), about an alternate-universe Foundation that was forced to *actively use* SCP objects to defeat alien invaders. Eventually developed into a spin-off project, [Андивионский Научный Альянс](http://scientific-alliance.wikidot.com/).

  * Creepypasta.

   * [«Новые тени»](https://mrakopedia.org/wiki/%D0%9D%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5_%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8) (1k), interesting concept based on the idea of "shadow biosphere".

   * [«Вигилия в пустыне зеркал»](https://mrakopedia.org/wiki/%D0%92%D0%B8%D0%B3%D0%B8%D0%BB%D0%B8%D1%8F_%D0%B2_%D0%BF%D1%83%D1%81%D1%82%D1%8B%D0%BD%D0%B5_%D0%B7%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%BB) (9k). The protagonist finds a coded message stapled to a tree, which turns out to be the first step in a long series of riddles prepared by a mysterious girl to whoever stumbles upon them. [Slight spoiler](#s " The plot could be interpreted differently, but at least one interpretation is interesting from rational fiction-perspective.")

   * [«Божественный эксперимент»](https://mrakopedia.org/wiki/%D0%91%D0%BE%D0%B6%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B2%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B9_%D1%8D%D0%BA%D1%81%D0%BF%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%82) (6k) and [«Провал божественного эксперимента»](https://mrakopedia.org/wiki/%D0%9F%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BB_%D0%B1%D0%BE%D0%B6%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B2%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%BE_%D1%8D%D0%BA%D1%81%D0%BF%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%B0) (5k). A virtually infinite number of people get teleported to a world consisting of one virtually infinite room; what happens?    
  (I've [posted its premise](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/76cly1/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/dod04xh/) to a Munchkinry Thread once.)

   * [«Окно наружу»](https://mrakopedia.org/wiki/%D0%9E%D0%BA%D0%BD%D0%BE_%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%83%D0%B6%D1%83) (6k). The protagonist discovers that one window in his apartment leads into a different world of some kind^(1), decides to investigate, and does so in a surprisingly rational manner.

  * Webcomics.

   * [*Evil Genius*](http://evil-genius.ru/stories/1), about a genre-savvy Bond Villain.

    It has been quite a while since I’ve read it, but if I remember correctly [*Слово о драконе* by Павел Шумил](http://fan.lib.ru/s/shumil_p/) (~550k words total) should either be rational or at least not have too many disqualifying bad writing tropes.

    >[spoilers](#s "It had technological uplift, colonisation of new planets, interdimensional travel (I think), some worldbuilding regarding the nature of the dragon species, etc.")

    >The protag of the first set of books is somewhat MarySue-ish.

  https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3972188-vita-nostra A Russian novel. There is an english translation though its very limited in terms of regions ([see this link\)](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Vita-Nostra-Sergey-Dyachenko-ebook/dp/B00A7GP5ZW). I ended up pirating it after searching for and failing to find a legitimate way to buy it. While the story does deal with the supernatural, I've never read a story with a similar premise. I'm just going to point to the name: Metamorphosis. 

  Ignore the sequels listed on goodreads. The story stands on its own.

  If you want an actual review (with a few spoilers) then check out https://inverarity.livejournal.com/209788.html

    I agree. This is one of the best books I ever read over the emotional impact.

    One of the "sequels" (they are not connected anyhow), [Brevi Finiteur](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10824015-brevi-finietur) is a rationalist-themed utopia with Black Mirror vibes

    > HakoMari comes to mind.

    Hmm interesting, maybe I'll check the MAL page --

    >Plainly put, this is garbage.

    ....Huh. Wonder what the second most helpful review says, maybe it gives further details on the flaws?

        ```
        >HakoMari's first volume (really a short story) is fairly representative of the series as a whole, and is a mostly self-contained story. Surely a short story is not too much for you to decide for yourself?

        Short stories usually have a length of around 5,000 words (anything over 7,500 words would typically be considered a novelette), and the Kindle version of HakoMari volume 1 is over ten times that length at over 60,000 words.

        Given that the Kindle ebook for volume 1 cost $8, I'm actually somewhat glad to find out that the first volume contains significantly more than a single short story's worth of content, but for most people, 60,000 words is a pretty big time commitment (3.5 to 4 hours for a typical reader).

  I think the works of José Saramago is the sort that this community might enjoy. His novels have crazy premises, but all the characters act in an appropriate way given the crazy premise. That is to say, they act crazy but in a rational way, as a reasonable response to a crazy world.

  For example, the premise of the novel *As Intermitências da Morte* is that one day people just stop dying. The novel is about the crazy yet reasonable reactions of the Church, the funeral and life insurance industries, the Maphia (with ph), the very old and sick, the government and so on.

  Another novel is about a mysterious epidemic of transmissible blindness, and another one is about an election where everyone voted blank.

  It's the sort of novel that is fun to read because it always makes you think about what you would do in place of the characters.

  Id recommend Release that witch (chinese).

  Story about an engineering student being sent to another world that resembles Feudal age Europe. An added twist is that Witches are real.

  Theres an ongoing translation, however Do not read from Qidian as the quality drops considerably.
