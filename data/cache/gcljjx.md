  >With a thought, Rain pulled his training dialog forward. Before he could even read it, he let out a strangled yelp. His body felt as if it was about to burst like an overripe berry. No sooner had the pressure appeared than it vanished, leaving Rain gasping for breath. An icy shiver ran down his spine as if he’d been dunked into freezing water.

  >Was that from the excess experience? I was at the cap when I went to bed, but in theory, Essence Well should have gotten me some stupidly big number. At least 170k…

  > ...

  >Yeah, I am totally going to do that again, aren’t I?

  So Rain = Ki cultivator now?  Did anyone read this part and immediately think that Rain might have found a way to raise his level cap?

    We can guess (for Doylist reasons if nothing else) that he'll raise his cap in a novel way soonish. 

    But he's done a bunch of novel things lately that *could* be the key. Feeding mana to slimes, making his interface do tricks, pushing past various flavours of soulstrain. 

    This is one more for the pile. We don't know enough about the true underlying system to predict which one will pay off. "Gaining so much XP that the level cap breaks" makes a certain kind of sense, but only if the system is sort of a physical object rather than an algorithm.

      I kinda hate that this has paid extra chapters. I can't not feel that people are throwing this kind of stuff based on the future knowledge instead of actually just guessing.

      I feel I can't participate in the discussions without being spoiled, because I'm at a disadvantage.

      I understand that the writer wants to be paid, and I have thrown some coins with Patreon to some things myself.

      My Patreon doesn't even work right now. :( Failed to pay last month for no apparent reason and they haven't answered my questions...
      ```

        I'm not a Patreon reader and am guessing purely based on what's publicly available, for what it's worth.

        Rain has been stuck at the level cap for many chapters, which is unusual for a litRPG, with only minor stat improvements to tide progression-fantasy fans over. This can't last. But Rain is not at all on track to visit a higher-level dungeon in the near future. And part of the appeal of the fic is seeing Rain defy the setting's conventions and baffle everyone. Thus, Doylist guess.
        ```

        - u/kaukamieli:
          ```
          I've seen people talking about it before a lot, so I'd guess your guess has more to do with the discussion where people seem to be too sure of that stuff, than the source material.

          Now, of course I could be wrong and it does not happen. But if he will end up leveling soon in a weird way, I will stop reading any discussions of stories that has patreon chapters if I don't pay myself.

          Rain could advance in many ways. He can make powerful friends. He can learn to use the artifact that makes the dome, which I'd bet is exactly what is going to happen. He can learn other stuff and he can get political power by helping Velika. Not all power is straight up leveling. He can get items, and he can learn to use these things he just found.

          There are not many times he could get a huge powerup from leveling. There is the silver, gold, platinum. IF the story is not short, and it seems to have a lot of stuff, other stuff has to happen too. He doesn't even need to get to the top tiers necessarily for a good story imo.

        As someone who has red the patreon chapters I can confirm >!Rain hasn't raised his level cap, and none of this stuff seems to be contributing to raising his level cap.!< I wouldn't worry too much about future spoilers.
        ```

        - u/kaukamieli:
          ```
          Dangling those spoilers in front of me? :D Well, I snatched it. Thanks anyway.

          As much as it feels like he could be close to finding a way to level by himself, he might as well just not find a way. MC shouldn't always win and succeed in everything.
          ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    I thought he just had an easy way to gain XP. He'll still need to kill an essence monster in order to raise his level cap but he'll be able to spend all that XP once he does raise his cap. He can also start unlocking every single skill tree.
    ```

    - u/Reply_or_Not:
      ```
      He has had a really easy way to gain XP almost the entire story so far: it is how he has unlocked viewing rights on all the possible tier 1, 2, and 3 skills.

      Every time so far he has always made sure to spend the experience without "wasting" too much by staying capped.  Him getting "multiple levels worth" of xp *while at the cap* is a totally new thing

      Yes, what we know *so far* indicates that the only way to raise your cap is to kill an essence monster.  But that still begs the question: how do essence monsters raise their level/level  cap?

      This is the  first time ever he got a shitload of experience while also at cap.

      of course *all of this is pure speculation* right now, but think about how Delve has  been written so  far, it generally follows a loop where:

      Rain experiences the physical reality of Magic effecting the world, and then later figures out what happened.
      ```

        > But that still begs the question: how do essence monsters raise their level/level cap?

        Uhh... We know the monsters just pop from somewhere. Folks clear a dungeon. After a while the monsters have popped, and some will just be blue. The monsters don't necessarily need to "raise" the cap.
        ```

  An interesting bit of lore.  Apparently there are three (presumably) Platinums still in the world.

  * Warden Vatreece - Mentalist
  * Potentate Fecht of the Adamant Empire
  * High King Kev, the ruler of Ter’karmark

  It also makes it seem like Gold+ are somewhat rarer than I had thought.  So far all the non-DKE/Empire Gold rankers we've seen belonged to a single party, and that it's not like World of Warcraft or something where you can just find a pickup group for a gold ranked essence monster if you're strong enough (although, the DKE *sorta* do that).

  This also explains why Lavarro isn't gold rank.  She's already in hot water with the watch, and now she's being abandoned by the guild.  If getting gold rank is as much political as it is power, then of course she'd have trouble.  I know that was a theory before but it seems virtually certain now.
  ```

  - u/zorianteron:
    ```
    Yeah, there's a discussion of the fact that monster (and especially essence monster) strength scales faster than human strength.  Add that to the party limit for lairs and the fact that most essence monsters are in lairs and it explains why it's a great, extremely expensive undertaking to get someone over gold.
    ```

    - u/kaukamieli:
      ```
      Well of course they do because these dudes don't use supports and the whole system is balanced for an actual party. ;)
      ```

      - u/xachariah:
        ```
        From my experience with MMOs, it seems reasonable that most of the population thinks 5 DPS is a balanced party.
        ```

  - u/EsquilaxM:
    ```
    Hargreaves wasbt a part of the Rousers. I expect other guild leaders are also Gold or around there, so not a single party but everything else you said I agree with.

  What I dont get is how a silver plate killed a citizen when said citizen held off a gold plate.
  ```

  - u/TheTruthVeritas:
    ```
    Lavarro mentioned that whenever she fought her husband Halgrave, she always won over him, despite being just a silver compared to his gold. She also stated that Halgrave is a bit too soft, which is why he lost to Westbridge as he tried to avoid damaging Fel Sadanis, which really handicapped him.

    Lavarro brought the fight right to Westbridge’s own city, and I think it was stated Westbridge cared for his city and citizens so he was avoiding collateral damage which likely handicapped him. From the conversation about the fight, Lavarro likely didn’t care at all about that and just went wild, which provides a huge benefit to her. She’s also a kinetic mage or something similar and I would imagine snapping someone’s neck at a distance would be a bit difficult to defend against, along with the surprise element. I mean, I don’t think any sane person would just roll up into a Citizen’s city and kill them and a bunch of other people.

    Honestly though, I didn’t expect Westbridge to die like that either, he was shown to have both experience and power, but I guess Lavarro is stronger than what her silver plate might suggest.

      You'd still need to overcome the HP pool.
      ```

  - u/xachariah:
    ```
    Aside from effects, Lavarro seems to specialize in single target combat.  Specifically it seems like her build is meant to kill squishies.  I think she just had a good matchup and had surprise on her side.

    That said, I didn't expect her to win.
    ```

  - u/xamueljones:
    ```
    Lavarro is very close to Gold. She is either around level 48/49 and missing the exp needed, or is having difficulty fulfilling the class requirements. So the level gap is probably not all that wide.

    Also, I fully predict that people will start making predictions that Westbridge faked his death in a variety of ways. With Lavarro's help to fool the DKE, with the DKE's help to fool Lavarro and the Watch, all by himself to fool everyone, with the Empire's help to fool the DKE, and so on....

      >!That line of thinking is absolutely going on among the Patreon readers who are a few chapters ahead.  Thus far, every scrap of evidence overwhelmingly points to WB being dead.!<
      ```

  - u/odoacre:
    ```
    It's been made clear many times that gold/silver/bronze is more of a political thing and not a factual measure of a person's actual level.

    People are paranoid about disclosing information about their real level, build and even class. Lavarro is an outsider, disliked by most people because she is scary and borderline psychotic. It stands to reason that the plate she wears is lagging behind her power level.
    ```

  - u/CoronaPollentia:
    ```
    Rock paper scissors, maybe. Pure force magic might be an uncommon enough vector of attack that Westbridge didn't have defenses against it, combine that with someone good at offense striking from surprise...
    ```

- u/sheikheddy:
  ```
  I have a feeling Lavarro's going to be the "But how could a bunch of Jades kill a Sage?" of this story
  ```

- u/Fiazba:
  ```
  Val is definitely in the Lair, right? He was unconscious at the start of the fight, and his body was probably dragged into a corner. Rain hasn't found his body. He probably woke up after the fight and went into the Lair, if only to get away from the corpses. He and Rain can then escape via the route Val took to get into the Lair without the guards spotting him (waterworks?).

  I hope Rain figures out how to make and/or level up Essence monsters. Even if he can't make his own from scratch, if he can take an existing one, capture it, and boost its level with Essence Well and some of the Tel he conveniently got just before the dungeon run began, that would be plenty. I imagine each level requires mana/essence as well as Tel. Probably following the base system of fibonacci per level of Tel and mana. 100 and 1 Tel for level 1, 300 and 3 tel for level 2, etc. Maybe it resets at 25 and costs GranTel? That would prevent Rain from immediately being able to become a Platinum.
  ```

  - u/Fiazba:
    ```
    Then again, Rain can't spend too long in the Lair regardless. He and his Purify are the only thing providing potable water to a city of 20,000.
    ```
