## [D] Friday Open Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could (possibly) be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.

  I've always wondered about web serial sites in other languages. In English we have RoyalRoad, ff.net, AO3, etc., but what about non-English sites? Anyone know any?

  And, now that I think about it, any non-English rationality groups/sites as well. How prominent would they be, given this English one is not that big either?

    There's [Shousetsuka ni Narou](https://syosetu.com/) ("Let's become novelists") which according to Wikipedia seems to have been the origin of a fair amount of popular Japanese light novels and anime, including KonoSuba, Overlord, various Isekai stories, etc. Though I don't know how many of the more well-known ones are still there- The Irregular at Magic High School was, if I remember correctly, taken down once it got a (great) print novelization. The currently airing [My Next Life as a Villainess](https://ncode.syosetu.com/n5040ce/) is still there it seems.

    Makes me wonder if any anime company would take up Mother of Learning.

      It always makes me a little salty that the japanese have this webfiction to novel to manga to anime pipeline for stories as dumb as "I got isekaid and now I'm a hot spring", but stuff like Worm or Worth the candle or Unsong only get the occasional bit of fanart. (admittedly, sometimes it's really good fanart, but still.)

      The western publishing industry has its head in its ass and continues to do only what made it money two decades ago, while appealing to the same readers that were reading two decades ago. At least RoyalRoadl has the webfiction to kindle unlimited/patreon pipeline.

      (Though I shouldn't be too salty. Latin america doesn't even have their own dedicated sites, they mostly just stick to the margins of the english language sites. One of my little brazilian cousin told me she reads stuff on *Episodes*, which was a hilarious conversation.)

      [Kakuyomu](https://kakuyomu.jp/) is also a pretty popular site with some published authors posting there (e.g. [KB部](https://kakuyomu.jp/works/1177354054882674008), an official meta-AU spin-off of GJ部, a cute slice-of-life light novel series).

    AO3 is a major non-English fiction site, iirc. I know they were a major bastion of Chinese fanfic writers before it was fully banned there.

    Russia has its fair share of dumb webfiction and sites that host it.  That's where all the translated litrpg is trickling out from. The big ones would be [Samlib](http://samlib.ru/), [Litnet](https://litnet.com/), [Author.today](https://author.today/) and promising newcomer, [Litmarket](https://litmarket.ru/).

    Asian hornets have orange heads.

    European hornets usually have yellow heads, but some have a brownish-reddish head instead.

    It depends on how it got here. If it was a batch of contaminated shipments, then it can appear in two different locations, with no in between.
    ```

  - u/RetardedWabbit:
    ```
    I'm not saying it's likely but it's possible they can be established near you and in the Northwest, but not in between. The hornets near you don't have to be from the same source as the Northwest. They are much more likely to have been imported to the coast by shipping or hobbyists than anywhere in between, so they could just be a separate import to your coast. It's pretty unlikely they've spread across the entire breadth of the USA without being noticed, especially given how distinct and scary they are.

    The environment and competition between the two coasts are drastically different. I personally haven't heard any accounts of them in the Midwest and I'm moderately connected to farmers, hunters, and beekeepers in the area. Also if media companies caught wind of it the story would be everywhere, it's too good of a story like killer bees and CCD.

    Edit: Or this opens up the flood of reports from across the country.

  What are your favourite textbooks? Or non-textbook sources of well-structured information about a particular subject?

  I've been thinking about [comprehensive information-gathering exercises](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/9LXxgXySTFsnookkw/exercises-in-comprehensive-information-gathering), and reading well-written textbooks covering unfamiliar fields seems like it'd have good return on investment. It's kind of like what schools are trying to do, except they're terrible at it.

  There's a [post](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/xg3hXCYQPJkwHyik2/the-best-textbooks-on-every-subject) on LessWrong about best textbooks on any subject, but it's positively ancient (2011).

    Introduction to quantum mechanics, second edition, by David Griffiths.

    I used it for my second year of university.  The university-mandated textbooks were obviously written by a committee, and reading them made me want to burn them.
    Griffiths' book feels like it was actually written by a person.  

    What is a physics textbook?  The core of the subject is the mathematics.  Really, if you just listed the basic equations/structures/relations, that's most of the meat.

    The reason to have prose is to bring you, the reader, into the state of mind that glues these mathematical models to a vision of the world- to bring multiple parts of your mind in line, and give them all small parts of the picture.  

    A high school equivalent- you have the maths describing the position and velocity of a ball moving under gravity for the part of you that deals with maths, you have pictures of trajectories for your visual part, you have prose to try to reach whatever other parts of you that it can by getting you to imagine stuff.

    I found this textbook fun to read.  Considering that it's technical, I find that impressive.

    I really like Spivak's Calculus as an introduction to differential and integral calculus, but it's certainly not for the feint of heart. As you usually get with Spivak books, it's very very rigorous. His most popular book is Calculus on Manifolds. An alternative I've also seen is Apostol's calculus. I've never read it, but I've heard it's good. 

    Currently, I'm reading Computability and Logic by Boolos et al. (as well as finishing up the last few chapters of Spivak's Calculus). 

    The Machine Intelligence Institute has a [research guide](https://intelligence.org/research-guide/) bound to be full of well written papers and textbooks. It's aimed at information relating to AI alignment, not general information though. This is where I found Computability and Logic. 

    Also, don't discard that LessWrong post! Most things in science evolve slowly, and for things like "the history of western civilization", good resources from 10 years ago are likely still good sources. 

    Often if you go to ~~/r/math~~ /r/Economics or really any other subject-specific subreddit, you'll find in their Wikis a bunch of good textbooks as well. I believe I found Spivak's calculus by making a post on /r/math. (EDIT: I vastly overestimated the number of subject-specific subreddits that have a resources section. In any case, if you make a post in those subreddits asking for textbook recommendations, they are more often than not happy to reply). 

    I'd also point you in the direction of [MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm), where MIT uploads a bunch of free, online courses complete with video lectures and often problem sets. For courses they don't upload videos and other materials for, they often include a syllabus which lists the textbook they use to teach.

    "Einführung in die Elastizitäts- und Festigkeitslehre" (Introduction to elasticity and strength of materials) honestly did a way better job at explaining the subject matter than my professor did. The book is from 1993, written by the professor's predecessor, and without it, I would have bombed that exam *so* hard.

    It's probably useless to you, seeing how it's written in German, but if anyone here is going to be studying anything Engineering-related at University of Stuttgart, *this book is vital*.

    The two best textbooks from my CS education were:

    * Discrete Mathematics with Applications by Susanna S Epp. Intro-level text on discrete math, sets, set operations, counting, and discrete probability. Very thorough, takes you through everything in small steps without repeating itself, and covers a lot of ground.

    * Algorithm Design by Jon Kleinberg and Éva Tardos. Advanced-level text on algorithms. Not quite as friendly as the former, but it does get the job done and the exercises are excellent.

    Other resources:

    * Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning by Christopher M. Bishop. I don't like this one nearly as much as the above, but it covers just about everything and I've spent so much time staring at its section on normal distributions that I'd feel weird not to mention it. (But maybe if it was better I'd have had to revisit it less often.)

    * [A Primer on Bézier Curves](https://pomax.github.io/bezierinfo/) by Pomax. Explains almost everything there is to use on Bézier curves, with interactive demos.

    * Beautiful Trouble: A Toolbox For Revolution. The top-level structure is a bit scattershot but the internal linking is great. Some of the "principles" section are the best resources on strategy I've read in any context. (Would recommend No Shortcuts by Jane McAlevey more for organizing methodology, but it's a pile of case studies, not a reference text, and I thought her interview with Current Affairs was more approachable.)

    And one more thing a bit off from what you asked for:

    * [directtovideo](https://directtovideo.wordpress.com/) by Smash. Not organized, narrative-format explanations of how a democoder made his best effects. Basically no information on "how" and everything on "why," which makes it one of the best explanations of the actual practice of advanced computer graphics I've seen.

  I've been reading a lot of [mythcreants](https://mythcreants.com/) lately, which led me to a 7-part series called [A Guide To Writing Women (For Men Who Don't Want To Offend Them)](https://patricia-penn.com/2019/11/23/a-guide-to-writing-women-for-men-who-dont-want-to-offend-them-1-7/).

  Reading it left me rather mortified at how many blatantly sexist/misogynistic/inappropriate descriptions have passed my inner critic simply because I was used to reading their like.

  I'd love to hear what other people here think about it.
  ```

  - u/Veedrac:
    ```
    Most of the examples they give seem pretty extreme to me. For a series which claims it's mostly talking about ‘something that isn’t inherently problematic, and it would ping nobody in a negative way if we lived in a world without misogyny’, I think it would have worked better to have gone a bit more nuanced. I don't particularly need it explained that it's crass to talk about how sexually arousing a corpse is.
    ```

  - u/Turniper:
    ```
    My experience with r/menwritingwomen and the twitter equivalents is that it tends to be roughly 25% blatant sexism, 25% men using a weird metaphor which doesn't land well to describe a woman, and 50% men writing prose which would not offend any reasonable person. If you're worried about falling into the first two categories, a better solution than listening to twitter is to just get some women you know to beta read your stuff and give you comments.
    ```

  - u/zorianteron:
    ```
    In part 2, they mention avoiding describing women's looks for the sake of it.

    But a lot of men like to read that sort of thing.  Even going beyond smut, that's the fact of existence for the interior of the male mind:  the experience of perceiving the world from the point of view of your average man is inherently offensive to a lot of women (and presumably vice versa).

    Now I want to see a work that takes each of these tips and goes in the opposite direction as hard as possible.

    (I also want to see the version written by a man towards women writers...  But I have a hard time imagining it.  Can you think of any identifiably female takes/writing cliches that some men might find offensive?)
    ```

    - u/Izeinwinter:
      ```
      That is not for the sake of it. If you want to do character look description, then use it as characterization of the current view point character - the fashionista will note the shoes, the cut and color of the coat, the fit, and completely fail to note in the text the age, race or fitness level of the person. The jock might notice how fit a character is, how well they move, the social observer the mannerisms. 
      It is, however, a problem if everyone notices the cup size of every woman they meet
      ```

      - u/zorianteron:
        ```
        Sure, but there's two levels here, aren't there?  The prose as all the hypothetically available details of the scene, filtered through the viewpoint of the view character- sure- but also as filtered based on your target audience/your own imagined perception.  And the target audience, given that not making a decision and going with what comes automatically is also a decision.

        You're giving information on the view character, but you're primarily giving information to the reader, and if your readership wants to know the cup size of every woman in the story- well, there' s a market for that isn't there? ;)

        I get wanting to avoid writing cringe, though.  But cringe is context-and-viewer sensitive:  one cannot be all cringe to all people.

          The title of the essay is: "A Guide To Writing Women (**For Men Who Don't Want To Offend Them**)."

          For your argument of 'what if women aren't part of my intended audience and I therefore don't care about turning them away?' the answer is: this essay isn't directed at you.

      As a haver of one of those heterosexual male minds I can see what you mean. Since reading the article series I've become aware of how my first, instinctual response when seeing a strange woman is to assess how much I want to breed with her. (Which honestly kinda weirds me out.)

      But isn't that exactly why we should make sure that our fiction *doesn't* focus on that, outside of porn? If our instincts are geared to ensure that we rate a woman's personhood as a secondary concern at best, then the fiction we create should strive to counter that.

      Additionally, including gratuitous descriptions of a woman's looks to please your heterosexual male readers at the cost of the enjoyment of other groups is yet another example of sexism/inequality, I think. As well as suboptimal writing.

      As to clichés about men that I would find offensive... I'll certainly be on the lookout for those in the future. The only one I can think of would be that men are incapable of properly dealing with feelings, be it their own or those of others.

        Maybe this is where technology can help us.  We can have the reader fill out a form before reading the webnovel, and the book can have several different versions of each paragraph based on the sorts of books the reader likes to see.  So for the same paragraph with the same basic information, the men get loving descriptions of the female sidekick's breasts, women get more of an emphasis on the male sidekick's physique, and people who want neither (or both!) get that.  You could composite it all together programatically when the page is loaded, based on the user's selected options.  This way, everybody can see what they want to, and nobody has to be offended/alienated!

        This started off as a joke, but now I really want to see it.

    - u/D0TheMath:
      ```
      It *does* qualify that it's for men who don't want to offend women. If you could care less who your story offends (good writing advice in my opinion. Everyone will read what they want to read and be happy), then describe women's looks as much as you'd like (or don't like).

    The less wrong Sequences are basically a series of essays addressing this question (with some more stuff besides). They are compiled in Rationality: From AI to Zombies, which I think is the best way to read them.
