## [D] The rationality of Stargate: SG-1

### Post:

I've always liked the way that the world of SG1 operates. They put a lot of thought into providing reasonable explanations for the advanced tech they come across, and the world evolved and adapted to new information as the show progressed. Here's a few examples of interesting story elements that I remember:

- __Tech level advances as new discoveries are made.__ The humans learned from the tech that they encountered out in the galaxy, then used their own ingenuity to build on that tech in new and interesting ways.
- __A common biology.__ Humanoid aliens are _actually human_. The show explains that ancient humans were shuttled off to various planets around the galaxy to serve as slaves. Some of those communities became free and developed their own societies.
- __Caution and SOPs are commonplace.__ Being an air force operation, the Stargate program was handled with a great deal of caution and foresight. A MALP is always sent ahead of any personnel to assess a planet's atmosphere and hostility, and the teams often default to following orders.
- __Enemies react to the protagonists.__ The various enemies that SG1 encounters repeatedly seem to learn from their mistakes. The replicators are a great example of this, becoming steadily more difficult to destroy as time went on.

Now, this is not to say that the show doesn't have big problems. It never gives a good explanation as to how everyone in the galaxy speaks English. It also takes liberties when talking about how wormholes function, and the Stargate addressing system is quite terrible (although this one could be explained as the creators trying to be way too clever when they designed it).

Are there any other fans of the show here? What would you change about the show to make it better? Do you agree with this assessment?

  I love Stargate! It does make a lot more sense than pretty much any other popular sci-fi franchise of the last few decades. One of the things it did a lot was to dissect and subvert the tendency towards "Awesome but Impractical" tech that very advanced species seem to have in fiction. The MP5 is definitively superior to most other handheld weaponry they encounter, even though most species dismiss it as a "primitive rock-thrower".

    Oh yeah, totally. Like when it was explained that Goauld weapons were more for show than actually being effective, since they were terror weapons. When you look at Goauld tech from that standpoint, it totally makes sense why they designed things that way, and why the humans choose to adapt it rather than just copy it.

      It also gave a convenient justification for the bad guys quickly upping in threat level.  Anubis packed in a rapid fire staff weapon and healing device into his Kull Warriors, the replicators overclocked Goauld hyperdrives, Baal cloned himself and later exploited the solar flare time travel glitch in a clever way.

      Another thing I liked about it was the tendency to reuse technobabble solutions to problems of the week in a consistent and logical manner.  Power surge makes gate jump addresses?  Try using that effect next time when you need to break a gate connection because of the blackhole.

  They never even gave a bad one; they just decided that having Daniel repeat every side of every conversation was undesirable and stopped doing it.

    In the books it mentions that the gates do something to you _permanently_. 

    Which causes other problems, admittedly.

      > Which causes other problems, admittedly. 

      Well, in a universe were psychics powers are possible, and even a common "evolutionary path", there is probably some simple mechanism for granting some kind of minimal psychic powers...

      - u/callmebrotherg:

        Oh no, not that. 

        It's that sometimes they needed Daniel anyway, and there didn't seem to be any pattern to it. 

        Also, you have to explain why, in the film, they needed Daniel to translate on Abydos but, in the series, they didn't need Daniel to translate on Abydos. 

        Not that this would matter much in an r!Stargate, but if you're trying to explain canon itself then you run into issues.

          well, there is a decent amount of retcon between film and movie. all milky way gates in the show use the same earth constellations, so addresses can't mean what they meant in the movie.

          I assumed Daniel taught them English during his time living there. And any Goauld could have learned English by briefly taking an English-speaking host. The real question is why the Jaffa (like Tealc) or the other human populations could speak English before they could have learned it.

    You know... I think just skipping technobabble explanations entirely is better when you can't come up with a good one.
    ```

  - u/booljayj:
    ```
    That's a good point. I think it was clear from the beginning that the reason everyone spoke English was so the show was easier to follow. It was a very meta decision.

  I agree with all you comments pretty much.  I really liked the show.

  Telepathic function of the gates?  If it provided enough to understand the basic language, but no idioms, it would explain why they still needed Daniel Jackson for communication sometimes but not normally.  It would also mean that they need to have other communication plans when they are away from the gate.

  Other stuff to reconstruct...

  Whenever a tech doesn't show up again, mention problems with adapting or reverse engineering it.

  Explain more about the Goauld Politics and Politics with the Asgard and Earth to justify why they don't repeat the blackhole dialed stargate into sun trick more often (and other OP tricks or uses of tech like that).

  Have them speculate on limitations or dangers of timetravel and develop a policy about it to explain why the don't ever risk abusing it more. (But are willing to risk it other times)

  The whole convergent evolution into a biologically compatible form with the ancients... my head-canon is that human life actually originated on earth and the ancients descended from time-traveling humans (who went back in time).  The only thing that could be construed as evidence for this is the ancient's taboo against time travel, the fact that the ancients have a civilization so old they can't remember their own origins, and the fact that the convergent evolution explanation is completely implausible without introducing other factors... (As another alternative... perhaps the ascended realm is actively manipulating the physical universe to create humanoid beings that can eventually ascend?)

    > Telepathic function of the gates? 

    There was a fanfic that I read (forgot which) that hypothesized that the gates rewrite your brain to understand a common language, but it's meant for Ancients-and-similar, and as a result the feature caused brain damage in the Goa'uld, gradually turning them into the lovable megalomaniacs we know now.

    Because if they used it once, the Goauld have no idea what was done or how they did it. If they use it more times, maybe the Goauld figure out how it works and just wipe earth off the planet. Plus, earth was never in as dire a situation again after that point. So it could have always been a "last minute backup plan".
    ```

    - u/scruiser:
      ```
      Yeah, my headcanon for it is something like that.  If the Goauld linked the blackholes in stars back to earth, they would probably retaliate with the same attack on earth itself and use a rogue element to maintain plausible deniablity to the Asgard.

    > Telepathic function of the gates?

    No, that doesn't quite cover it. They're able to communicate even in episodes where they travel by ship. Unless the gates supposedly effect everything within a few lightyears of their position. Nice thought, though.

    > Explain more about Goauld Politics

    I totally agree. They seem to operate somewhat independently, but also with a kind of feudal system. Some of the Tok'ra episodes started to explain their politics and tendencies, but it still divided the species along strict lines of 'good' and 'evil', with no real in-between.

    > limitations or dangers of timetravel

    That's one thing we never see happen. The leaders of the Stargate program know that time travel exists, but they never really get into the possible uses or rules for it. Aside from just putting the time machine in a locked room until they _really_ need it, that is.

    > Convergent evolution... with the ancients

    I thought they explained this in the show, that humans were actually created by the ancients. They were leaving the planet, going to their magic energy sky palace, but some of them wanted to leave something behind. So, they created a species that would look just like them and could potentially follow in their footsteps.

      Yeah, it doesn't quite work with the show as it is.  However, ff you were doing a rationalist take on it, you could use this idea to keep events fairly consistent with the show.  You would need to remember that they need translator technology when on ships or otherwise away from the gate.  I think the Gouald had some kind of translator tech... maybe they could use this in a rational!fic?

      > I thought they explained this in the show, that humans were actually created by the ancients. 

      That would make more sense... I am pretty sure the show described it as the ancients encountering the evolutionary predecessors of humans.  I am pretty sure canon (TV-show, I've never read the books) only mentions interbreeding, however I've seen fanfics that described them as genetically modifying the early humans to be more like the ancients and/or interbreedable with them.

        Canonically, Both.

        Humans were engineered by Ancients, or at least their predecessors were, hundreds of thousands of years ago.

        Then, in about 8000 BC, the refugees from Atlantis returned to Earth after the loss of the war with the Wraith. Some of them ascended, others crossbred with the new existing humans. 

        This is the origin of the ATA gene in the modern human population, and it is why it is only in Tau'ri or Pegasus natives.

  One of the authors said that the stargate inserts nanobots into people which do translation for them. They didn't want to have to handle having Daniel do a new translation every episode.

  One notable lack-of-rationality in SG1 was the goa'ulds' security. They rarely seemed to guard or reposition gates, for example. And they never copied the idea of a protective cover controlled by radio.

  Loved Stargate SG1 as a kid, recently rewatched all of it.  I think it's an excellent show, and they did a really good job of remaining creative in terms of the encounters / types of episodes they have.  Good mixture of things happening and character development etc etc.  

  Watched some of Atlanis but never got that enthralled.  Is Stargate Universe any good?
  ```

  - u/iamzeph:
    ```
    I liked SGU for what it was, but the tone was way different than SG1 and Atlantis (which are more campy) to the point that you'd never think they were the same story universe except for the lore references.

  - u/booljayj:
    ```
    I liked Universe a lot, mostly because of the atmosphere. It went right back to the roots of the Stargate series, where people are thrown into a situation with technology they barely understand and motives they can only guess at. It also has the stranded-on-a-desert-island vibe, so it was cool watching the crew figure out what they needed to do to survive. I would recommend it, though you may find yourself wanting more when you reach the end of the limited run of episodes.

  The movie made a nod in that direction by having everyone speak a language close to Egyptian. And this makes sense if the Goa'uld ruled that region during that timeperiod, though we'd then expect Egyptian to be a linguistic isolate. The Goa'uld would keep a static language of administration; the Jaffa would all speak it; there should be a decent supply of human slaves that speak it. Furthermore, since the Goa'uld territories are widespread and many of the other races are fighting against them, there should be people who speak this language in pretty much every race.

  However, being a lingua franca or the language of administration isn't the same as having most everyone speak it. The Hittite Empire had a Hittite language, but I believe Hattic was the language of administration, and most of the people typically spoke Luwian. We can imagine, though, that the Goa'uld, insisting on being able to interrogate even the lowest slave, would insist that everyone speak Egyptian on pain of pain.

  Furthermore, you can pretend that the entire Stargate base operates in Egyptian and English interchangeably.

  Independent planets would still pose a significant communications problem.
