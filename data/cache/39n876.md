    Yeah, he said on Patreon that be'd try sticking to a 3 weeks release cycle, and he delivered:

    >https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/37/Mother-of-Learning

    >Greeting loyal readers! I have published a new chapter, and well within my self-imposed three week limit too! I will aim for the next chapter within three weeks as well, with an eye for improving it further.

    >Read at your leisure and tell me what you think.
    ```

      He means that his profile page said the next chapter would be on the 14th.

  Typo thread for /u/nobody103 . I love MoL and I offer these typos in the spirit of improving it! :->

  "Not in a way I had expected or **planed** for" - should be "planned".

  "Domination and suggestion **represents** spells" - when you say "X and Y", that's plural, so it should be "represent". For example, Murray and Cantwell represent Washington in the Senate.

  "spells that **enforce caster's** will upon the target" - missing "the".

  "Suggestion and **Illusion** are subtle methods." - the other mentions of techniques aren't capitalized in the middle of sentences.

  "these things were all **unquestioningly** useful" - instead of an adverb, you want "unquestionably" here, which is an adjective.

  "the Yellow Cavern **guardians** lost both their matriarch" - should be capitalized.

  "causing **to whole** the whole thing to blow up" - extra words.
  ```

    /u/nobody103 please notice me sempai

    Is there some easier way for readers to submit/edit typos for chapters? Like [Mother of Learning's page on Baka-Tsuki](http://www.baka-tsuki.org/project/index.php?title=Mother_of_Learning), where users can make simple spelling/grammar corrections.

    Fictionpress doesn't allow copy+paste afaik, and Baka-Tsuki doesn't update fast enough and might not have enough visitors to make it worthwhile.

    Also, any update on expansion to sites with more readership/traffic (Wattpad)? 

    Thanks for the new chapter!

      Sadly no. Fictionpress and Baka-Tsuki are the only places the story is posted at for the moment. I do have plans to check out Wattpad one of these days, but somehow I always find something more pressing to do.

      Fooling fictionpress's stupid copy block is a simple matter of going View>Page Style>No Style, at which point you can copy whatever you want. If you don't want to install one of many workaround browser extensions, that is. 

      If you don't want to clutter the threads on this subreddit with corrections, you can always send me a PM to this reddit account.

  This is such a good book so far :) I love the Exile/Avernum GIFTS references, that game was my childhood.

  Very interested in seeing just how powerful Zorian is now.
  ```

- u/Ozimandius:
  ```
  I wonder how long he has been looping exactly.  I can't tell if he's been at this for a couple years or decades honestly, because sometimes it seems like a year will pass in a single chapter and other times only a month or so has gone by.
  ```

  - u/literal-hitler:
    ```
    Chapter 32 said he had been through three years of restarts, I believe it's been at least half a year, but no more than a year since then, but I could have missed something.
    ```

- u/Evilness42:
  ```
  I'm calling it **now**, Zach is going to ***hammer*** Zorian in the face next chapter. Zach doesn't seem like the kind of guy to go back on his promises, and this'll be the first time they've met since Chapter 26.
  ```

  - u/ggrey7:
    ```
    That's assuming Zach will stop his southern tour (running away from Red Robe) and that Zorian will attend his classes full-time.
    ```

- u/Bowbreaker:
  ```
  >"About my paymentâ€¦" he began.

  >Zorian's eyes abruptly shot open as a sharp pain erupted from his stomach.

  Damn. I thought the repaid his service with assassination.
  ```

  - u/literal-hitler:
    ```
    I thought that Zach had died right as he was finally able to learn memory manipulation..
    ```

- u/Dreamliss:
  ```
  Curse you so much! I hadn't even heard of this story until two days ago, and now I'm done with it. I'm so upset, I have to wait for installments now. Being up to date sucks.

  Anyone have stories that are similar to this in style or feel? Sort of a fun power build up but couched within rational means?
  ```

- u/Bowbreaker:
  ```
  >We do have excellent low-light vision though. **But we're getting off track.**

  Can I say that that second sentence somehow screams great writing to me. Being able to give a small bit of trivia and then getting back to the meat, all the while making it sound as natural and normal as we do in everyday conversations is just awesome. I think the part where ~~D~~**Z**orian goes through things just like I could imagine myself with all the highs and lows of life that that involves is what I love most about your story.

  That and the rational D&D style magic world of course.
