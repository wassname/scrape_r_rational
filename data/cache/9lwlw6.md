## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  I'm currently sketching out a variant of [The Rules of Wishing](https://archiveofourown.org/works/4637439/chapters/10575111) (very) loosely based on [Twisted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-77cUxba-aA) (NB: Chances of my going anywhere with this are relatively low, I'm mostly just thinking this through). As part of that I'm planning to nerf the wishes down to a bit more "mundane utility" level.

  &#x200B;

  As in rules of wishing the restriction have a certain amount of in-build extensibility and a certain degree of sentient judgement built in. Assume anything that looks like you're trying to rules lawyer will be nerfed (e.g. no wishing for wishes, no "I wish for X and Y" composite wishes, etc). Beyond that the main restrictions are:

  1. The wish may only directly affect one person and requires informed consent from that person.
  2. Even indirectly the wish may not harm anyone (ETA: The level of indirection here is bounded. You can use things given to you by wishes to harm people, and long chains of causality are fine. This is mostly a cap on things like "I wish for an anvil to appear over their head").
  3. The wish may not cause persistent magical effects. Once the wish has completed in "reasonable time" (not more than an hour, certainly) the result of the wish is purely mundane.
  4. The wish may not grant people knowledge that has never been known by any human. However it can combine from multiple sources. e.g. you could wish to be the best, say, blacksmith in the world and you would get knowledge that was not possessed by any single blacksmith to date. You could not wish to learn how to make technology that has not yet been invented.
  5. Similarly the wish may not grant an entity \~\~physical\~\~ capabilities outside of the range of normal variation for the target. You could wish to be the strongest man who ever lived, but not for the strength of ten regular men. You could wish to become a youth in peak health, but not for immortality.
  6. ~~The amount of stuff a wish can create is bounded to, say, the size of a large palace.~~ The total volume affected by the wish (including creation, destruction, modification) must be contained within a contiguous region contained in a sphere of no more than about a mile in diameter.
  7. Wishes cannot create or restore life.
  8. The wishes may not grant knowledge about or otherwise affect any other magical items that may exist.

  (The actual rulebook is much larger, and may be expanded in response to wishes)

  You have three such wishes, and are a native in a roughly medieval tech setting. What do you do with them?

  &#x200B;

  Additional rules added as a result of munchkinning:

  1. ~~The area of effect of the wish may be no more than a few miles across (I can make a ruling on exactly how many is "a few" if it matters)~~
  2. The rules of wishing themselves cannot be affected by wishes.
  3. The results of the wish may not depend on knowledge of the future. e.g. you cannot wish for something that maximizes the chance of some outcome occurring.
  4. The rules may not create anything that could not in principle have been built by a small number of people subject to the "normal range of variation" rules in up to about 100 years of work and an effectively unbounded amount of unskilled labour. You cannot bootstrap this by assuming such people have access to previously wish-created items i.e. you can wish for things that have been created to an implausibly high level of engineering and craftsmanship, including the development of some new techniques, but new technology is right out.
  5. The rules may not create non-living intelligences (mostly covered by the previous rule).
  6. Ruling on the interaction between knowledge and  "normal range of variation" rules: What is achievable for a given person is roughly "assume they are at one in 100 billion levels of natural talent and worked at this for their entire lifetime".

    Wish one would be the essential 'I wish to be as intelligent as the most intelligent human to ever exist' or some variation on that if the wish giver is malicious. Alternatively, 'I wish for all the knowledge of rules lawyering'. Something to that effect. I can then base future wishes on that level of intelligence, which would affect my other 2 choices, but if precommitment is a thing that has to happen, then...

    Does rule 2's 'anyone' cover microorganisms? If not, I would wish for all harmful to humans microorganisms to be modified to not harm humans in a single change. If germ theory has not been invented, then a varient of that (ie 'the end of those malignant curses' or such) In scenario one, it is not a persistent magical effect, but rather a single change, and thus works even with rule three. In scenario two, it is essentially the same thing, if less informed. Either way, it will keep humanity less dead for a decent length of time. Advice with better phrasing would be appreciated, as this is just the general gist of things.

    Finally, a wish to be placed in the position where I can do the most good at the most personal satisfaction. This should be relatively lofty due to my wish for high intelligence, and essentially works as a poor man's precog without the work of interpreting it, since I'll essentially be creating the future which gives me the most bang for my buck.

    One thing I didn't take advantage of was a noticeable lack of defence against 'meta' wishes in the main list of rules (eg, 'I wish that my future wishes were not affected by the rules of wishing'). You gave it a sort of acknowledgement before the list, but rule 8 only concerns items, when it could be altered to affect wishes as well. That would be my only qualm at a glance.

        The Genie is approximately a standard Robin Williams grade genie. He's not malicious unless you piss him off.

        >  Alternatively, 'I wish for all the knowledge of rules lawyering'.

        This actually requires a persistent magical effect because the rules list gets updated in response to the effect of wishers. 

        > I wish to be maximally skilled to every degree.

        I think this would get rules as composite and you'd have to pick some more specific skill set.

          I don't see how that follows; even if the rules adapt to prevent "exploitation" over a certain threshold, there should be an acceptable level of comprehension that stays in bounds. Any rules lawyering knowledge that would be invalidated as a consequence of it's bestowal is necessarily invalid rules-lawyering knowledge and therefor out of scope for the wish anyway. Wish one in this case, simply guarantees the best possible human wisher is making wishes two and three on your behalf.

      Well, *in* universe it's not, but out of universe I don't have the ability to grant wishes and the wishers will only be as intelligent as I can write them, so...

      > Does rule 2's 'anyone' cover microorganisms? 

      No it's specifically restricted to humans.

      > Does rule 2's 'anyone' cover microorganisms? If not, I would wish for all harmful to humans microorganisms to be modified to not harm humans in a single change.

      Hmm. I'm trying to rule out large-scale global effects. I'm not sure what the best restriction to put in place to prevent this solution is. Maybe some maximum area of effect? Say, no more than an area a couple of miles in diameter.

      > One thing I didn't take advantage of was a noticeable lack of defence against 'meta' wishes in the main list of rules (eg, 'I wish that my future wishes were not affected by the rules of wishing').

      Yes these rules aren't intended to be a complete list so much as the "essential flavour" (when "rules of wishing" started the official number of rules was 5211, though obviously that's just flavour text and I didn't write down that many rules). In general the rules of wishing cannot be affected by wishes.
      ```

      - u/TheJungleDragon:
        ```
        To rule out the microorganism wish, you could alter the creation volume rule to also be the maximum volume of destruction and alteration, and perhaps have that volume be continuous by necessity.
        ```

        - u/DRMacIver:

          Yes, that's a good idea, thanks.

          That wouldn't work because [the volume of say viruses](https://what-if.xkcd.com/80/) is absolutely miniscule. Better to just stick to a range limit (no more than a mile away from the caster) that way you can't have your area of effect be some planck-length thick (but wider where it needs to encompass viruses) thread that encopmpasses every human virus in existence.
          ```

    > Even indirectly the wish may not harm anyone.

    This seems to rule out almost everything.

  - u/BoojumG:

    That's a lot of significant restrictions. However, there are only probably-circumventable linguistic difficulties with personally obtaining the synthesized sum total of all knowledge and useful insights held by any human ever. There is probably a huge amount of value in that synthesis. 

    It's your blacksmith example, but broadened as much as possible. And there are compounding effects from the synthesis - your uber-blacksmith would be capable not of just all the things any individual historical or contemporary blacksmith could so, but also a wealth of new things only enabled by their combination.

    If you can get this full synthesis done in one wish, the rest should probably be spent getting a head start on having the means to apply the knowledge. Details would be shaped by exactly what you want to accomplish.

    The possibility that this wish causes problems with human biological limitations should be addressed and mitigated or circumvented if possible. At some point these mental assets and capacities butt up against physical limitations mentioned in your restrictions. If so can we circumvent them by no longer remaining human,  but becoming an instance of some other class with different physical limitations? Or is that exactly what is restricted by saying "the normal range of variation for *the target*?

    ----

    Another, separate point is that more understanding around what *should* be accomplished may be just as important as the knowledge and means to enable it. It's natural to think you know what you want, but wish stories are also full of foolish desires fulfilled and regretted. The sum of all human insights into what makes people happy or capable is a great help, but can we use a wish to get any additional wisdom/knowledge on this topic?

    Given the clarifications, the best wish seems to be "I wish for a FAI of maximal permissible capability that activates on my say-so." Obviously first wish for a skill that makes you able to spot issues in wishes first, should you have multiple, since you don't want to mess this one up.

    So, does this rule prevent harm through idiocy and ignorance?  I'm thinking about what happens if people start wishing for things they don't understand, especially using celestial metaphors. Astronomical amounts of gravity and energy are fundamental with these things, but cataclysmic for us on earth.

  Let's say that you're in a high fantasy universe, and you've gained an enchanted item that increases the angular momentum of anything reasonable (you, if you're wearing it, or, heck, a trebuchet if it's equipped to that). Specifically, this would square the mass constant in the angular momentum equation.

  What would be a few imaginative and practical uses for such an item? In terms of personal weaponry and combat, just as a start?
  ```

  - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
    ```
    What does reasonable mean? Presumably you don't want us increasing the angular momentum of the planet and killing everyone, but what about tornados? Can you increase the angular momentums of spiraling winds heading in the direction of your enemies, amplifying them into terrifying tornados? 

    &#x200B;

    Or better yet, can you build yourself a zorb and just roll around (even uphill) by increasing it's angular momentum? You can literally be the boulder in an Indiana Jones movie, except you ignore gravity.
    ```

    - u/causalchain:
      ```
      About the Zorb. I think the key point is that you can only *increase* the angular momentum, not decrease nor change its direction.

    You can do perpetual motion pretty easy with this, right? Enchanted flywheel powers a non-enchanted flywheel, which powers the enchanted flywheel plus whatever else you want.

      High fantasy setting though; infinite energy requires other technology to use.

      - u/hh26:
        ```
        You can make mechanical devices out of gears and pulleys and stuff.  They already had wind/water powered flour mills, you could probably construct some sort of power hub with your perpetual motion machine inside, and have chains or gears or pumped water going out from that across a city to power other things that used gears or water power.  I don't think they had a lot of gear-powered devices in the middle ages, largely due to the lack of efficiency, but if you had an infinite power source a lot of otherwise impractical devices would become useful.

        If you had this device but were not a crazy smart inventor, the best thing to do would be to find some crazy smart inventor and get them to invent whatever technology they thought this device could be used for.

        With flywheels, not *much* tech. Pumps, for example, have had all sorts of advantages in terms of providing running water to areas above the water table since ancient egyptian times. Similarly, the lathe and the grist mill.

    You don't want to put it on a trebuchet. When you apply it to an object and square the mass, the moment of inertia will increase not the angular velocity. This will make your trebuchet *harder* to turn and won't speed it up. 

    It is very useful for things that you want to keep spinning such as a thrown spinning weapon (shuriken or frisbee), or things you don't want spinning such as you. You could apply it to your opponent's weapon as they are trying to swing, and watch as their practised motions utterly fail them. 

    It would be prudent to set a 'unit' for your mass so that we can accurately see how the scale of the object affects the moment. Angular momentum is measured in kg m\^2 s\^-1, and we can't change that even in fantasy. So if we multiply the mass onto it then we need to convert it to a dimensionless number by dividing it by a "one mass" constant. This also implies that if the object is below one mass then its angular momentum will decrease instead.

  You are a person who is, by your nature, driven to affect the world at large. (As many of us are.) You are also a wizard, capable of applying magic in arbitrarily flexible ways, though with limits on output which prevent you from affecting more than a cubic mile or more than a ton of matter.

  A magical edict has been active for some time which forbids wizards from affecting more than their personal scope. This does not discriminate between means (e.g., you cannot do it by magic and you cannot do it by political office). The explicit exception is defending the world against external threats (aliens, shoggoths, Outsiders a-la the Dresden Files), and the implicit exception is that other people affected by you can affect more than your (or their) personal scope.

  Attempts to modify or affect the Edict will guaranteeably, lethally fail. Things which violate the Edict will fail in ways that at best expend your effort for no effect.

  How do you solve the problem of the Edict and change the world?
  ```

  - u/xachariah:
    ```
    Can you create an external threat (or assist in opening the way)?  If so, then solve it using your preferred method, that also makes you the ruler of the world.  OTOH, you'd almost certainly lose, since you'd be the villain of the story.

    Also, how is 'external threat' defined?  The world is at threat of asteroids and gamma ray bursts at all times.  If it has to be embodied, do the threats need to be coming after earth specifically, or can you just let loose as long as whatever you're doing will eventually kill some shoggoths?  And if so, how does the edict know?

    "I am the grand wizard Lazarus! Within my domain, anything is possible. Come, all ye kings and venture capitalists, and see your wildest dreams fulfilled!"

    You can run a wish-fulfillment service in exchange for favors. No limit on wishes but you have to complete the favors before your wish is granted, non-negotiable. Since you can do anything within your domain, it should be easy to provide people with concrete things that they want (your son back from the dead? ZAM! Making you the smartest person on earth? That's three favors, ZAM! A million bucks? Here, just take it as a gesture of goodwill, I've got more diamonds than I know what to do with!)

    This way you can live in whatever your definition of extreme luxury is, while also tweaking world events whenever someone important comes to see you.
