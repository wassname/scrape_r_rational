- u/Sophronius:
  ```
  Two chapters at once again, since the new rules in the sidebar say authors can only post once a week - at least I don't think that rule was there before. If anyone else wants to post the (biweekly) updates, they're welcome to do so of course.

  For those who are waiting for an update to NTBS, muchos apologatos. Trying to write two stories at the same time while also doing my dayjob turned out not to work at all. I may have very slightly overestimated my multitasking skills. So instead, my plan is to finish this story quickly, and then go back to updating NTBS. Again, sorry for the wait!
