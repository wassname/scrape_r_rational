## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  ```
  I recently read [Tree of Aeons](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/20568/tree-of-aeons-an-isekai-story). I wouldn't really recommend it, the writing is poor and not all that rational, but the part I really liked was how long the timeline of the story was (is, it's not finished yet). The main character reincarnates as a tree and lives for hundreds of years, slowly building up power and making very long term plans like giving his followers powers that they can pass down to their children.

  Does anyone have any recommendations for similar long term stories?

  I want to repost and re-rec something posted by /u/lo4952 in [last week's](https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/11k144r/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/jbowbb8/?context=1) thread:

  >[The Dragon-Kings Temple](https://archiveofourown.org/works/6211903/chapters/14231311) (*196k, Complete*) is an *excellent* Avatar The Last Airbender / SG1 crossover. Post-canon Zuko and Toph find themselves stranded on another world, and the Stargate cast tries to figure out how these damned kids are doing definitely-not-magic.

  The world needs more SG1 fanfic. Crossovers are really enjoyable to read with that universe for some reason.

  If you're okay with some smut, Ship of the Line: Forever After Earth (*197k, Complete*) by Ephemeral ([TVTropes Page](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/ForeverAfterEarth)) is a SG1/Buffy(/megacrossover) crossover that is Yet Another Halloween Fic. The scoobies get transformed into "FAE" from the author's [original setting (again, tvtropes)](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Earthchild), which is where the lewd bent comes from.

  If there's any other Stargate crossovers (or even non-crossover fanfics) you like, more recs are always welcome.
  ```

  - u/Weerdo5255:
    ```
    I'll recommend The Dragon Kings Temple any time I see it, that's a good one. 

    I'm assuming you've gone through [Reunions are a Bitch](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3546854/1/Reunions_are_a_Bitch) and [Contact at Kobol](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11126728/1/Contact-at-Kobol) those are the two big Stargate Crossovers that come to mind. Both are the 12 Colonies of Kobol up against a SG1 Earth before the colonies fall. 

    One Stargate story I found recently digging through some searches  and filters was [Turning Point](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4872268/1/Turning-Point). It's romance with some smut at the end, but Daniel Jackson has some typical sci-fi time travel shenanigans, and ends up meeting Egeria, the progenitor to the Tok'ra. 

    The story is the establishment, and fulfillment of a stable time loop where Daniel helps create the Tok'ra as a whole. 

    Not particularly rational, but it's not horrible. 


    [Stargate Etheria](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/stargate-etheria-stargate-sg-1-she-ra-and-the-princesses-of-power.966974/) is a fairly recent juggernaut, still getting frequent and massive updates. 

    Interestingly for a Stargate crossover, (With She-Ra) it's at the start of the Stargate Program. Before Earth even establishes contact with the Asgard. Instead SG1 stumbles across a world with 'magic' and which is incredibly gay, ruled by child soldiers turned Queens. 

    Queens who don't particularly care for hiding the stargate or the threat of aliens from space, but do want to help Earth. So the story so far has been the political apparatus of Earth making first contact, and quickly moving to meet the Queen's stipulations to get hold of alien tech. 

    So far more political thriller than anything else, but I'm liking it, even if some of the politics are being abbreviated for story brevity.
    ```

    - u/degenerate__weeb:
      ```
      I haven't seen those BSG crossovers, actually. Should you read one before the other? It looks like Reunions isn't complete, so I'll probably read Contact first.

      I did get to Chapter 24 in Etheria but lost interest. Not sure what didn't keep me. How would you compare the quality to Dragon King's Temple?
      ```

      - u/Weerdo5255:
        ```
        Reunions isn't going to be finished, but it was a foundational point for a good bit of Stargate vs Kobol fanfiction a decade ago with most others taking it as the theme to follow. The most important aspect being the establishment of the theme with the Kobolians being religious extremists. 

        Contact at Kobol is a little too favored on Earth's side with it being set in the far future of 2020 (Ha!) where Earth has had time to start understanding some of the Asgard core, the Stargate is known and colonization has started. 

        Reunions is a little more balanced with Earth and Kobol being at parity in total power, even if one side is due to numbers and the other technology. 

        It get that with Etheria, The Dragon King's Temple is still my favorite. Etheria I'll come back and read a dozen chapters. It's political thriller in the 90's, which is realistic, but slogging through all the political machinations of Russia, China, and USA of the time and the hamfisted resistance to it all is a little taxing. I'm hoping things will pick up with the actual alliance being established.
        ```

  - u/staged_interpreter:
    ```
    Yeah, Star Gate crossovers are always fun - remember reading an X-Com/SG1 crossover. It starts out as a bit of a stomp-fic. No-name Go'auld are just no match plasma weapons, exoskeletons and psykers but the villians get an upgrade too, sadly abandoned somewhere around the Atlantis saga. Not very rational but great meshing of the two universes and a novels worth of reading so far.

  ```
  I've reread the Quantum Thief again, and for the first time its sequel, The Fractal Prince.

  Strong recommend. I'd like to learn how to write in a similar style, which forces the reader to pick up bits and pieces about the world, like Jupiter-that-was. Though the books seems to be avoiding the entire ethics of emulated minds. Maybe it's in the third book? Still need to find a copy.
  ```

  - u/Empiricist_or_not:
    ```
    I think you should finish the series, there is a lot more exploration  as to how each faction treats their people, and some big questions get answers. 

    If finding something more ethically aligned is a condition for your enjoyment, then, you should read "The Age of Em" or just about anything by DataPacRat. In that type of case, then  reading The Causal Angel might be like reading the Gulag Archipelago, valuable but unpleasant; the moral failure states expressed by the Sobernost and the Zoku are sadly plausible in states where the rule of law becomes the rule of persons.
    ```

  - u/N0_B1g_De4l:
    ```
    I think there are hints at a number of simulation ethics questions (much like there are hints at everything else), though perhaps they show up mostly in the third book? I don't really remember which scenes go where. But the stuff about "cognitive rights" and the Engineer-of-Soul's whole job gives you something to start with, and the way the Hisen-Kus approach their ancestor sims has some other bits. Plus the whole thing with the Zokus and their particular conception of identity.

        Some of the great gengeneering stuff is hidden in throwaway sentences, not having any further impact but their implications: 

        Ada Palmer, Too Like The Lightning, "The twins were on a fig craze and overprogrammed the tree last month! We have more than we can eat!"

        Neal Stephenson, Anathema, has "library grapes", which are a meta grape featuring all known grape genomes and expressing them based on soil/sun/rainfall etc. Its basically uber-wine, but no plot relevance. There's also paper-trees, producing archive-grade paper as leaves once dried. 

        Bruce Sterlings "Bicycle Repairman" has some lines about giant neo-lobster farming, no plot relevance. (great transhumanist story, its my No.1!)

    My recommendations are more genetic engineering and low level biotech than strange biotechnology/vat monsters, but these two books by Adrian Tchaikovsky, feature both. (I would recommend more from him but I haven’t read anything besides these two yet)


    Children of Time (which you’ve probably heard about) features a ton of biotechnology, and some genetic engineering. The >!spiders!< are genetically engineered, and they use a ton of biotech, much of it low level and practical. 


    Shards of Earth also features biotech, and has some cloning vats- the Parthenon uses cloning and genetic engineering extensively, but not outside the human genome. It doesn’t necessarily focus on the Parthenon though. 


    I hope this helps, even if my recs more well known, but what other commenters have suggested are really good as well, especially Orion’s Arm which gets weird.

  Binged Shadow Slave in two days, thanks to those who recommended it! The Forgotten Shore arc was pure kino; I really enjoyed how the mystery of the world’s history was uncovered - any other works which have a similar aspect to them? For example Lord of the Mysteries, Elantris…
  ```

  - u/IV-TheEmperor:
    ```
    I was going to make a top level comment but since there is already one about Shadow Slave I'm going to hijack yours. I also started Shadow Slave. Currently at chapter 63 but can't seem to progress beyond that. The Second Nightmare arc so far is such a bore. When does it end? I liked the First Nightmare well enough.
    ```

    - u/thunder_crane:
      ```
      I think you’re still in the dream realm. The second nightmare doesn’t begin until much much later. 

      I agree that the initial introduction can drag a bit but I would say try to stick with it until ch 100 or so when it really switches gears and sort of begins one of the main conflicts in the forgotten shore. I think you’re about to read about one really good encounter (imo) if you’re at the mysterious tree (all hail) so maybe that’ll keep you going but also understand if you can’t stand it.
      ```

      - u/IV-TheEmperor:
        ```
        >I think you’re still in the dream realm

        oh actually you're right. It's just that there has been many fights with the nightmare creatures I thought the 2nd nightmare had begun. Maybe I'll like it more if it begins proper. But the fact that 2nd nightmare is still yet to happen is not giving me hope lol. hmm... I might skip ahead to see if it would grab my interest.
        ```

        - u/thunder_crane:
          ```
          I agree, it can be a bit confusing. When the concepts were introduced to me first I also though the characters would face the second nightmare fairly soon. The author sort of made the dream realm sound like some training ground or prep point for the second nightmare and that the main conflicts and story would be happening within nightmares. While they do, I think it’s a much more even split between nightmares and dream realm/real world. I also don’t think the author really outlines just how big of a difference there is between the difficulty of each nightmare and the power levels of people who can challenge or beat them. I could compare them to wuxia levels for reference maybe lol. 

          Everyone in the forgotten shore is essentially there by mistake/bad luck. It’s an uncharted territory in the dream realm because no one ever makes it back from there due to a lack of gateway - people on the outside don’t know of it, and and anyone on the inside is there until they die. Author brings up the concept of human controlled areas before they go and it seems like most people who enter appear near or at them.
          ```

      Spoilers: >!The second nightmare ends 300+ chapters in.!<
      ```

      - u/IV-TheEmperor:
        ```
        oh. I thought the structure was gonna be nightmare -> real life -> nightmare -> real life. Nightmare chapters focusing on the trials and the real life chapters focusing on academy and maybe some fluff. But that is sooo much further in lol
        ```

        - u/thunder_crane:
          ```
          It’s more…nightmare > real life > dream realm > real life > (mix of dream realm and real life once the MC can move between them freely) > second nightmare 

          The second nightmare can only be challenged from within the dream realm (so you find second nightmares in the same world as the forgotten shore), not the the real world like the first nightmare.

          For what it’s worth you will definitely get those chapters eventually. The author develops an interesting dynamic between the dream world and the real world and how factions operate between them.
          ```

  - u/thunder_crane:
    ```
    Same here. I didn’t consider second nightmare as interesting but overall it’s a fun read. Weirdly enough I often think about the forgotten shore arc and how interesting it was. I know we technically still keep finding out really core knowledge and history and secrets but the deadly unknown and isolation of the forgotten shore really made it special. 

    Recent developments seem to have highlighted an interesting split in the readers, which I think is justified. I do wonder why the author has chosen to write certain plots and characters the way that he has because I find them confusing.
    ```

- u/AsynchronousAtom:
  ```
  Give The Mech Touch a try. It’s SciFi set in the distant Age of Mechs, long after the Age of Space and Age of Conquest. 

  Humanity has deemed warships too barbaric to use in internal rivalries between states, and now promotes mech based combat. At first, it seems like a pure SciFi novel, but as you get deeper, you realize something isn’t quite right. Mech pilots slowly gain the ability to warp reality as they grow stronger, and Mech designers can grant the mechs they design abilities that just aren’t physically possible. 

  There’s a hidden supernatural side lurking in the background of human history, and the current reigning rulers of human controlled space - the Common Fleet Alliance (CFA) and the Mech Trade Association (MTA) are trying to cover up it up.

  The story follows Ves Larkinson, a member of a prestigious military family in a border state that finds out he has no genetic aptitude for Mech piloting - Mech pilots use a neural interface to control their mechs, and without the right type of brain, you will simply explode during the data transmissions between the pilot and mech. Undeterred, Ves decides to become a Mech designer, and equally noble profession in the current Age of Mechs.

  https://ranobes.net/the-mech-touch-v71134-214004/310675.html

  There are minor system elements initially, but as you go deeper into the story, it all begins to make sense. The system is explained in universe, and it isn’t all powerful - in fact, it’s related to one of the greatest conspiracies in the entire galaxy.

    ```
    4600 chapters? 😳

    Sounds good to me.
    ```

  - u/LaziIy:
    ```
    So I got like 550 or so chapters in and the plot just really degraded into a pretty weird space opera, does it just stay like this for long? I liked the whole genetics, mech designing and company growth stuff but this military draft arc is pretty boring.
    ```

    - u/AsynchronousAtom:
      ```
      The thing with the mech touch is that it’s basically a chronicle of Ves’ entire life - the author writes a ridiculous number of side quests and plots, and works on developing Ves’ design philosophy, mentality, and character growth slowly. 

      Personally speaking, most people who love the Mech Touch all dislike at least one arc, but the whole package is brilliant. As you progress further and further, all the old details and little stuff mentioned starts to make sense - why is it really that warships are banned? Why does the MTA promote the usage of mechs so much? Why can Expert Pilots really bend reality? As you go further and further, you’ll realize that the world Exlor has created isn’t just a pure science fiction.

      Basically, you’re learning about the world at the same time as Ves.

    [There Is Nothing To Fear](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/there-is-nothing-to-fear-harry-potter-au-gryffindor-voldemort.667057/#threadmark-category-1) is an AU where Tom Riddle was sorted into Gryffindor instead of Slytherin, with all the effects of that and his alternative rise to power explored through a variety of short stories. There is also one currently ongoing long story, featuring Hermione Granger returning to England as a student of Beauxbatons for the Twiwizard Tournament being held at Hogwarts, called Hermione Granger and The Silent Country, that revolves around her being pulled into the schemes of various people and factions as another piece on the board being played on.

    The level of detail and complexity in the story is fascinating. The best example I can give of this being that while Margaret Thatcher being mind controlled into supporting nuclear disarmament is a minor story note coming as a result of Riddle's rule and priorities, there's an [actual accompanying speech](https://archiveofourown.org/works/27264121/chapters/67465199#workskin) written for Thatcher's announcement of this. It's done so as to mirror her real pro-nuclear stance in real life, and available as an additional document in the appendix, for anyone who enjoys that level of detail.

    [Birds of a Feather](https://archiveofourown.org/works/15996890) is the sadly abandoned HP fanfic of Babylonsheep, otherwise known for the Worm fanfic [Tabloid](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/tabloid-worm-artfic-%E2%80%94-complete.455278/) and several really great illustrations.

    The fic is an AU where Hermione was born earlier; the same year Tom Riddle was, in fact. They meet when her rich mother distributes books to the orphans, and strike up a weird friendship.

    Alexandra Quick.

    It's basically original fiction set in the Potterverse, and not in the UK.

        Just be aware that it's a YMMV story: I think the MC is a stupid brat who refuses to learn from her mistakes. It got to the point where I was actively rooting for her to get murdered in increasingly gruesome ways, so I stopped reading during the third or fourth book.

        I still get irrationally angry every time I see someone recommend the series :p
        ```

        - u/Dragongeek:
          ```
          Yup. It's genuinely fantastically written, extremely creative, and so good that it's probably better than JKR's original work, *but* the protagonist is the type of person that induces blind, all-consuming, homicidal rage in /r/rational readers...
          ```

        - u/suddenly_lurkers:
          ```
          It's just really hard to root for anyone in the series. Alexandra is a flawed protagonist, but it seems like a constant cycle of the adults treating her like shit and then acting surprised that she doesn't trust them to have her best interests in mind. Which then causes Alexandra to go do more dumb stuff.

          The world building and writing are fantastic, but it's just very frustrating to watch that cycle happen over and over.

    Alexandra Quick is excellent. Could easily be published if it wasn’t set in the same world. I read through all five books that are out in a frenzy, and I hate series and have the hardest time finishing books. It is *that* good.

        Here's a brief selection of the highlights. If you're already a fan I'd suspect you've seen most of these, but I have my full list of favorites available if you want that PM'd to you.

  I'm a sucker for magic systems or powers that are so well defined as to be programmatic, or are inspired by programming concepts. What are your best recommendations in this category?

  (I have read Ra, the Wizardry series, everything by Macronomicon)

    [Avaunt](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/35125/avaunt),  ([which got recommended last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/11k144r/comment/jbh7uon/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)) has very programming themed magic.

    I'd say that the emphasis is perhaps a bit on *themed*. If you're looking for really crunchy details of the programming environment you might be a bit disappointed, but I think much the same about e.g. Ra. Still, it's very good, and probably has the flavour you're looking for. 

    There's also the Laundry Files by Charles Stross of course, which are similarly programming themed magic.
    ```

    - u/SirReality:

      I have now read Avaunt. That was very good, and just the thing I wanted. Thanks for the rec! I really liked the just sensible enough techno babble that gave you hints at the underlying structure but didn't bore you with the details.

  Can I have some webcomic/webtoon recommendations? 

  Some of my favourites are SMBC, XKCD, Dinosaur Comics, and Butterfree for web comics where each update is stand alone. Order of the Stick, Digger, and Love Advice from a Great Duke of Hell are great ones with over arching stories.
  ```

  - u/Flashbunny:
    ```
    Could I get a link for the Butterfree webcomic? Unsurprisingly, my attempts to google it were thwarted by Butterfree being part of the largest media franchise on the planet.

    In return, in no particular order:

    [Lore Olympus](https://www.webtoons.com/en/romance/lore-olympus/list?title_no=1320&page=1) is a superb webtoon based on a somewhat-modernised re-telling of the story of Persephone I'm always excited to see update; I think I remember reading that it's being developed into a TV show? It has nice art. Regular updates.

    [Kill Six Billion Demons](https://killsixbilliondemons.com/comic/kill-six-billion-demons-chapter-1/) is a great comic with great art. I think it's just come off of a short hiatus, and is on its last book.

    [Schlock Mercenary](https://www.schlockmercenary.com/2000-06-12) is a space opera comic I'd happily recommend, though the artwork is pretty dire to start with. (It gets better.) It's finished after *17* volumes.

    [Grrl Power](https://www.grrlpowercomic.com/archives/comic/gp0001/) is a pretty good superheroes comic. Regular updates.

    [Girl Genius](https://girlgeniusonline.com/comic.php?date=20021104) is a great comic that won the Hugo Awards for graphic novels for the first few years that award existed. Regular updates.

    [Drowtales](https://www.drowtales.com/moonless-age/6099) is a finished comic with nice art. I think its story was a bit stronger earlier on, but I'm happy to recommend it.

    [Dr McNinja](http://drmcninja.com/archives/comic/0p1/) is a finished comic that's about as old as Digger. Like many webcomics, it undergoes [Cerebus syndrome](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CerebusSyndrome) after a certain point with coherent plotlines and becomes a classic.

    [Manly Guys Doing Manly Things](http://thepunchlineismachismo.com/archives/comic/02222010) was a pretty good comic, with consistent characters and setting but no overarching plotline. It's been dead for years.

      I just read and enjoyed Kill Six Billion Demons, but while the art + general theme + world + symbolism is nice.. it has a bunch of issues. Still worth reading, but eh.
      The characterization seemed to grow simpler over time, like they had a single important character trait that they were eventually set to. There isn't much intelligent decision making, it seems very shonen-like where there's a fight then another fight then another fight then more and very little else. It feels like one of them being a >!major demon!< in a past incarnation and the other being an angel is rarely notable? Like, the major demon thing is only notable for that one >!halfway-betrayal!< arc and then not important. She has some special ability from being a demon, but the whole experience she must have never appears. The angel cares a lot about law at the start, but then just stops mentioning it.  
      Most of the stories plot points were kinda.. meh? No one does anything that interesting with them.  
      The philosophy was kinda dull, random nihilism and the usual shonen 'ill break fate with my ~~fists~~ will!'. 
      I'd still rec it. It isn't *bad*, and the general setting does put it apart from a lot of other stories in the similar style.. but I just look at it and think 'this could have been a lot better'.  
      I now kinda wish someone would write a rationalfic take on the story, which could be interesting.

    Didn't read too much webcomics (though I liked SMBC and XKCD, so I need to check out the rest you mentioned), but I can recommend [1/0](https://www.undefined.net/1/0/?strip=1) and [DM of the Rings](https://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=612).

    [1/0 review] (https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/cn0rdj/dc_c_10_an_old_webcomic_with_no_fourth_wall/) by u/DAL59:

    > From 2000-2003, there was this great 1000 page webcomic called 1/0, in which the characters had full knowledge of their existence in a webcomic. The first 70 pages are just crossovers and fluff, but then the deconstruction of having no fourth wall begins. The characters do experiments to determine the physical and narrative laws of their universe, debate the nature of their free will, sometimes rebel against their author, and find out their universe will end at the 1000th comic. Some of them become willfully ignorant of the existence of the author in order to stop worrying about his omnipotence. Its surprisingly deep for a low quality black and white comic.

    And here's [the blurb for the first strip](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/DMOfTheRings) of DM of the Rings:

    > Lord of the Rings is more or less the foundation of modern D&D. The latter rose from the former, although the two are now so estranged that to reunite them would be an act of savage madness. Imagine a gaggle of modern hack-n-slash roleplayers who had somehow never been exposed to the original Tolkien mythos, and then imagine taking those players and trying to introduce them to Tolkien via a D&D campaign.
    ```

    - u/chiruochiba:
      ```
      For people who like DM of the Rings, you might also enjoy [Darths and Droids](https://www.darthsanddroids.net/episodes/0001.html), a webcomic that turns the Star Wars movies into a series of tabletop campaigns between a group of friends.

      The players often improvise in ways that force the GM to go way off the campaign script that he had planned, and bits of lore arise organically from the players messing around. For example, laser swords (aka lightsabers) become the defacto weapon of the jedi players because they couldn't afford to buy blasters with their starting money at the beginning of the campaign.

      The author of DM of the Rings sadly died last year, but his kid is actually [remaking the comic in high-res](https://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=55070), which is nice because to be honest I always thought Darths and Droids looked much nicer.

    Perry Bible Fellowship. Short, funny comics, if you like the humor. Ongoing. Started with bad art.

    Hark! A Vagrant. Funny, often about history. Archived.

    [Rice Boy](http://www.rice-boy.com/). Moody adventure comics in alien worlds, with great art (particularly Vaatu). Rice Boy is a complete book, the website in general is ongoing.

    Stand Still, Stay Silent. Post-zombie-apocalypse scandinavia. Basically a graphic novel.

  Are there any megalomaniac uplift stories?  
  Often, uplift has the protagonist put in a spot and they realize they can take decisions to benefit everyone. They likely gain a position of power, and often have a kinder and more egalitarian form of governing.   
  I'm thinking that it might be interesting (though I'm unsure how enjoyable?) to read a story of someone who ends up in another world/whatever and does uplift, and instates themself as Emperor/Living God/King or whatever. Not necessarily evil, but also definitely not doing the uplift notably out of the goodness of their own hearts.
  ```

  - u/bildramer:
    ```
    IIRC [Displaced](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/15538/displaced) has a bit of that, though it's been a long time since I've read it, and it's less megalomania nad more frustration/spite. Also, it's not the main focus of the story.

  - u/chiruochiba:
    ```
    You might enjoy [Hail Hydra?](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/hail-hydra-mcu-villain-si-complete.851572/reader/). The main character gets isekaid into the Marvel Cinematic Universe and meddles to improve the world as well as increase Earth's ability to defend itself against the apocalyptic threats that are coming. He pioneers technologies that bring about a post-scarcity economy, which has tumultuous effects on society across the globe.

    Unfortunately, along the way he chooses the 'ends justify the means' path far too often, and quickly swan dives off the slippery slope of morality. He starts with good intentions, and a whole lot of hubris, but he might qualify as too evil to fit your request.

    That's pretty much the goal of the FutureSpaceMiner MC of 'Sexy Sect Babes' over on RoyalRoad.

    Unfortunately, the low tech world he ends up on is a Xianxa world full of cultivators who could easily squish him if he didn't have his (civilian) Exo-Suit/Power Armor.

    The story has surprisingly little smut, considering the title and premise.

  [Death Loot & Vampires](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/65108/death-loot-vampires) is a complete story recently posted to RR. 


  It is LitRPG, so if that is a dealbreaker be warned. Crowdsourcing extra proofreading/editing is a RR classic, so if you can’t glide over small mistakes stay away. 


  The number one reason I am recommending it is because there’s sometimes a clamoring for insanely rational MC’s making choices solely and specifically to gain power. Or… that the “right” choices (when you have perfect/near perfect knowledge of a situation)  are obvious and should be taken. 

  If that intensely driven decision making is appealing to you, you will find it in this story.
