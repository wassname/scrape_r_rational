## [RT][MK][FF]Recommendation: Memorials series (worm)

### Post:

I'm somewhat of a lurker, which means I don't have a rapport with anyone here. So, I'll preface my recommendation by mentioning this prior [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/23l0qj/cenotaph_worm_fan_fiction/) and directing you to Eliezer Yudkowsky, who stated ["Cenotaph is the most original-flavor thing I can ever remember reading"](http://hpmor.com/2014/04/), high praise indeed!

Memorials -- if you haven't gathered by now -- is Worm fanfiction, which means it contains: superheros, supervillains, *murder hobos* and terrified civilians. I would not recommend Memorials to anyone who disliked Worm, on account of its dark tone. Not to say Memorials is dark all the time, just that it's set in a universe containing *Jack Slash*.

Disclaimers out of the way, I'll just outright say that Memorials is -- in my own opinion -- better than the source material.

Unfortunately I cannot go into the story without spoiling said material. But I will say, Accord is in it and he is acting rationally -- while being true to the character to boot.

On the topic of Memorials characters, they're extremely well thought out. Every one of them is rationally furthering their agenda. It's actually somewhat sad, Worm's characters almost feel like a caricatures of themselves, on reflection.

All of this adds together to produce a world, which is so internally consistent, as to be almost as realistic as our own. In other words, it's one of the most rational pieces of fiction I've ever seen.

If you'd like to give it a shot there are three *books* in the series: [Cenotaph](https://archiveofourown.org/works/1152749/chapters/2337442), [Wake](https://archiveofourown.org/works/2417525/chapters/5347754), and [Legacy](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/legacy-worm.345448/) (in progress).

**TLDR**: This guy likes it [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/23l0qj/cenotaph_worm_fan_fiction/), Eliezer [enjoys it](http://hpmor.com/2014/04/), and I love it. It's rational, go read it.

  Ironically, I feel like Worm fanfiction where there are 'rational' characters somewhat misses the point.

    ```
    You can't expect characters in Worm to act truly rationally due to their outside influence. It's like saying you can write rational characters on LSD.

    Unlike the LSD case, the shards have an agenda and they influence their hosts, who have their own agenda. You can extrapolate to their combined actions, to some degree.

    I'd argue that the original work is a Rational fiction already. There's less arbitrary stupidity than there is in HPMOR (magical Britain in general outside of the main characters).
