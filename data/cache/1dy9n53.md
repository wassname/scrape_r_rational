## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  [Red Wishes Black Ink] (https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/80545/red-wishes-black-ink): This feels like the first new epic fantasy i've found and enjoyed in some time. 

  In this world the gods have each faction send a group of champions each year to fight for a wish. A bountiful harvest for the farming town, a more intense winter for the trollkin, the annihilation of a nearby city for the death cult...

  The author has done a great job with the premise so far and the world and magic he's created feels fresh while being very easy to pick up. The character writing's great, very distinct voices and there's even an intellect based competence porn-esque pov for this sub.

  It's sitting at 140k words right now and has been updating regularly, twice a week since its inception.

    I find myself strongly liking some POVs and feeling pretty meh about the others.

    I'm at like 100k right now, but given the constant POV switch, I'll probably wait for more chapters to be made before making my final judgement. So far I like it. Good worldbuilding. Not a fan of MCs whose name start with U.
    ```

  - u/AurelianoTampa:

    Caught up to the most recent chapter, pretty interesting story with a lot of world building that goes into it. It's starting to come together showing how the POV groups will intersect, although the sheer number of different groups and characters can make it a little difficult to follow everything. I haven't had the feeling of everything clicking quite yet, but it's a slow burn with a looming deadline, so I expect it'll pull together eventually.


    Definitely a better story than a lot of fics on RR that have many more followers and comments.

    Just tried the story, enjoyed it! I will say that despite the crafty/tactical types being some of my favorites, I found myself strongly disliking this one (that may be intentional from the author though). Oceanfolk storyline most compelling so far.

  Repost from the previous thread:  

  Uplift fiction is fun. What non-fiction books would be best for learning the process behind scientific advancements? (Technology evolution over civilizations, how that technology was made, et cetera...)
  ```

  - u/No_Dragonfruit_1833:
    ```
    Frankly, you would need more knowledge about intermediate tech


    There was this book called Manual of the Barefoot Architect filled with how to build stuff using mud and bamboo, and i always find uplift cfictiob to miss that first step


    The most egregious was some fiction where the mc just gave schematics to the local blacksmith, and the dude made machine parts to specs just by hand


    Lathes, anvils, ore refinement, steel air furnaces, aluminum extraction, those are a must, all the steps for early machinning developed in the late middle ages/renaisance
    ```

    ```
    How to Invent Everything by Ryan North is a good fun book which goes over how to make different inventions or implement useful processes along with some history about them.
    ```

    - u/MagicWeasel:
      ```
      yeah I was about to suggest this, so seconded.
      ```

    Nand2Tetris is a more technical book about how you go step by step from transistors to a full basic operating system

    I just recently learned of the "What made Apollo a success?", the writeup for how the moonshot was accomplished, which you might enjoy.

  I recently read House of Suns by Alastair Reynolds. It’s fun, and has some interesting mysteries and problem solving. I don’t recall any particularly bad errors in reasoning or planning.
  ```

  - u/Raileyx:
    ```
    I second this recommendation, awesome worldbuilding in this one, give it a read.
    ```

- u/GloveLife876:
  ```
  I would like to request any piece of literature where the protagonist is a hive mind. If possible I would like the story to be set in a medieval-like timeperiod but appreciate all other suggestions that fulfill the first criteria. An example of a story that fulfills the first criteria is [A Certain Little Legion (Recursive Raildex SI)](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-certain-little-legion-recursive-raildex-si.1125212/) published on spacebattles.com.
  ```

  - u/blasted0glass:
    ```
    [A Fire Upon the Deep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Fire_Upon_the_Deep) may meet your request. It features spacefarers crashing on a medieval level world and trying to survive amongst a race of group minds. The sequel [The Children of Sky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Children_of_the_Sky) takes place on the same world.

    However, group minds of six or so individuals are not the same thing as hive minds. Most of them are more like individuals that happen to have six bodies.

    On the other hand, there are also a few actual hive mind characters in the work.

    [Hive minds give good hugs](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/45048/hive-minds-give-good-hugs)
    ```

  - u/CatInAPot:
    ```
    Doesn't happen immediately, but the MC in Godclads evolves into a hivemind maybe 1/3rd of the way through the story.
    ```

    - u/GloveLife876:

      Thank you for the recomendation, I have already read part of Godclads([Royalroad](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/59663/godclads-monster-mceldritchcyberpunkprogression), stub, [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Godclads-Broken-Cage-Progression-Fantasy-ebook/dp/B0CQMLB7P3), book 1) but have not reached that part yet so you have reignited my interest.

      ```
      Do you recommend godclads? I read the first several chapters and while I liked the concept, the 11/10 intensity levels every single second of the story made it kind of hard reading.
      ```

      - u/CatInAPot:
        ```
        I personally love Godclads, I actually think it's just gotten better as it continues, and I *really* like how the author has set up the main antagonist, and their relationship with Avo.

        The intensity goes down... somewhat. The story becomes a little less viscerally brutal as it goes on, and Avo slowly claws himself out of constant peril to just occasional peril. Still a lot of action, but he becomes the perpetrator more and more.
        ```
