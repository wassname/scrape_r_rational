  Are you looking for the [Worf Effect](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect)?
  ```

  These are both close, but I think there's another trope. It's almost like [Always Second Best](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSecondBest) but not exactly. Ugh. I hate not being able to remember things.

    EDIT: After reading the DBZ entry for it, it was INDEED the Worf Effect. Thank you /u/bigjdp345! Deleting post now.
