## Thinking of starting a rational fan fiction based website blog/forum.

### Post:

I'm thinking of creating a rational fan fiction website. I want to add in the ability for anyone to post their stories and fans to rate them. There would be no subscription and would be ran simply for ad revnue/donations. Would anyone be interested in something like that?

  Do you think a separate site has advantages over using the existing solutions?

  And if you the answer is yes, the question remains whether you could re-use existing code. The excellent [archive of our own](http://archiveofourown.org/works/777002/chapters/1461984) (which also supports [contests](http://archiveofourown.org/collections/aliens_and_time_machines_prompts)) have their code [on github](https://github.com/otwcode/otwarchive) where you could fork it. (You could say forking other projects is a rationalist tradition as lesswrong is a fork of reddit ;-)

  If the site got popular enough I'd also like to host rational writing contests with prizes. The winners chosen by the fans.

  You're welcome to repost The Two Year Emperor.

  Also, there are several things that I dislike about FFN and would love to see in a new site -- if I could find them all, I would move off of FFN.

  * Threaded reviews / comments / whatever you call them. I want to be able to reply to my reviewers
  * The ability to review a chapter more than once, for when I re-read.
  * Daily views & visitors stats
  * A posting process that requires fewer actions than the very clunky one on FFN.
  * No f'ing link-eater or copy/paste disabler.  Jesus H. Christ on a cracker, those things are just bloody annoying and they throw out the baby with the small amount of bathwater.

    I'll keep all of this in mind while developing rationalfiction.com
    I'm building the website alone so it make take a while(unless people want to help :D) however I will guarantee at least a little work everyday. I will try to improve on what ffn lacks and i will never use copy+paste disablers. If you want to help out feel free to make an account on my site and submit stories.  Any stories submitted i while later convert into an archive containing all the chapters.
