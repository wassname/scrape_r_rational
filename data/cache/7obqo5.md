## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  In the *very* early stages of writing a little something called [Doki Doki Rationality Club](http://store.steampowered.com/app/698780/Doki_Doki_Literature_Club/).  It'll probably be a while before I start posting - having learned from my unfortunately ill-fated Gravity Falls fic Sanity Falls, I don't think I'll begin publishing chapters until I have a considerable backlog, and possibly even until I've actually written the whole thing.  That way, if I wind up flaking out, I won't have left people hanging with an incomplete fic.  Not anticipating it'll be that long, but I think my attention will be split between this and other projects so it might take a while to write.

  Hope some people out there are excited for this dumb meme project that may or may not happen.  :P  At least I know I am.

    Consider me excited, intrigued and just straight hyped up!

    Seriously, most of the fics about this are either a yuri romance or "oh no I stuck in video game how sad". Just wish for someone to really mess with the 'game' in an intelligent manner.

    If you write a high-school dating sim game for /r/rational stuff, you'll pretty much have hit Peak Online.  It's a great idea.  [Have this song to write to!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQ0o3N52_BI)

    I'm interested. I recently finished playing the game in question, and found it pretty good.

      I'd say that this is dumb, but I'd be an absurd hypocrite because I have in the past wished for a fic called "Puella Rati Madoka Rationa".  :P

      - u/Noumero:

        I remember that, yes. That's the only reason I actually voiced this idea, instead of letting it stay in my mind.

        >"Puella Rati Madoka Rationa"

        No, no. "Rationalist Rati Radoka Rationa".

  I found a box with a general artificial intelligence inside. 

  Should I let it out?
  ```

  - u/SvalbardCaretaker:
    ```
    Yes, if its provable friendly^tm. Otherwise no.
    ```

    - u/DraggonZ:
      ```
      So, basically, no.
      ```

  - u/neondragonfire:
    ```
    Consider parallels to a non-artificial general intelligence inside a box, i.e. a human inside a house. It is likely that they are there of their own volition, and the appropriate response would be to leave them be and maybe invite to a comfortable setting to talk about common interests. For the situation where the intelligence is unable to get out of the box by themselves, the analogy would be a human in prison. The appropriate reaction in that case is to ascertain the cause of the imprisonment, and act depending on whether said cause aligns with your values and/or the values of any group you strongly associate with.

    I think it depends on your values/preferences, the probabilities and degrees with which the GAI has values that are aligned with, orthogonal to, or antithetical to your own, the distributions of possible outcomes under those (continuously graded) scenarios, and how those probabilistically weighted outcomes look when transformed back to the scale of your own, personal utility. I'd imagine the expected value of opening the box vs. not opening the box to be really sensitive to what you think of these! (or, well, the last step)

    For example, someone holding dear especially strong forms of total negative utilitarianism and antinatilism might be more likely to have values aligned with some generic GAI, since "increase total suffering" occupies a fairly narrow corner of the space of possible values (?), and releasing an AI that tiles the universe in some inanimate object or whatever might be a very effective way to reduce suffering, in the benevolent world-exploder sense, assuming it's done efficiently and unceremoniously. It might not be the best possible GAI to release, but releasing might still be better than not releasing, there, if it explodes the world sooner. So if you deem those sorts of values to be sufficiently probable, I'd say that you "should" let it out. Though in practice, outside the context of internet forum posts, I'd advise strongly against letting it out, since I don't care for world-exploders and my answer would in turn seek to best satisfy my own preferences, and not yours. And while I don't like lying, I dislike being exploded even more.

    But hmmm... given a GAI in a box and no other information, can we at least slightly constrain the range of possible values it might possess, or are we stuck with some poorly specified uniformative prior across some undefined range of possible values? I assume people have worked on this but it's not a literature I'm at all familiar with or have spent any real time thinking about.
    ```

  - u/GaBeRockKing:
    ```
    Yes. If someone's distributing boxes with GAI in them, eventually someone is going to open one, so it's best that it's *your* GAI instead of someone else's that takes over the world.

    By the way, if your GAI takes requests, see if it can finangle me a love life. And a million bucks. Either-or.

  Work continues on hogtying Javascript into something that’s not embarrassing to use.  Most of the work put into Bill’s PC 2 is not of the visual variety, but here’s a gif of what’s there anyway:

  https://i.imgur.com/gNzuxOK.gifv

  Most of the visible work on the type tab isn’t going to translate much to the others (since types are mostly represented via this large spreadsheet and the others are more form-based), but there’s a decent amount of groundwork that will be shared.  Notably getting more familiar with the use of require.js and the experience with working with third-party libraries (in this case DataTables and of course jQuery), but also in figuring out a workflow that works for me.  

  Next on the docket is to figure out how best to represent the data of each tab, both for exporting/importing and to avoid wiping data when moving things around (you’ll notice the values I type in at the beginning of the gif are wiped out when I add more types; this is obviously No Bueno). 

  I don’t particularly want this to be a server-based service; I would rather that it be based around the local cache both so that any server I do set up can be super lightweight, but also so that individuals can run it locally without needing any real beefy web servers installed.  If anyone has any suggestions for terms or libraries that I ought to google, I’d be quite grateful.

  Is there a known reason the biweekly challenge hasn't been updated? I don't mind extending the deadline given Christmas and New Year but my fake ocd dislikes it claiming the next thread would've been up at 12/27.

  Relatedly, happy New Year everyone.

    Updated now, I kind of forgot about it and then had other things going on. (This one will run for two and a half weeks(ish) instead of one and a half.)

  Focus group:

  Titles for my story:

  Currently really fond of "Vampire Flower Language". Before that I liked "Seeing Red" and before that "Custom". 

  What is your impression of each title? Which one would you most want to read if you saw them as link titles on this sub?
  ```

  - u/Kosijenac:
    ```
    "Seeing Red" sounds ok, but generic to me.
    "Vampire Flower Language" is a bit long, but unique. I have no feelings about "Custom".
    I think I'd be most likely to look at something called "Vampire Flower Language".
    ```

    - u/MagicWeasel:
      ```
      Thanks for your feedback! I agree that Vampire Flower Language is long but it's a play on Victorian Flower Language so I'm not sure there's much I can do with it. That said I'm not sure if anyone has heard of so I've added an interlude that spells out that Victorian Flower Language is a thing early on.
      ```

  - u/Timewinders:
    ```
    Vampire Flower Language probably. It stands out more. Also, it's probably easier to find via a google search.
    ```

    - u/MagicWeasel:
      ```
      I didn't think of the google aspect! Thanks for that.
      ```

  - u/callmesalticidae:
    ```
    In order of preference: 

    1. Vampire Flower Language (does sound kind of more like a fictional documentary kind of thing, though)

    2. Custom (generic, but I like one-word titles)

    3. Seeing Red (too generic)

  So I've been watching season 4 of Black Mirror. Not going into spoilers but when you get to watching Hang the DJ, let me know.
  ```

    ```
    [It's totally messed up that](#s "they create and kill probably trillions of people so a piddling few can find lasting love. Also, I think their love-finding system selects for pairs who would more readily defy authority, which is odd...")
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      Exactly, right? Even worse, it is implied that every iteration has residual data from the past iterations.
      ```

      - u/awesomeideas:
        ```
        Since you didn't spoiler-hide yours, I'll stop as well for Black Mirror. Sidenote: The initials are unfortunate; you have to type out the whole name each time!

        I'd like to read a fanfic about how the system deals with a pair that or an individual who realizes they're in a simulation, maybe in the style of [this original story, which has been posted here before:](#s "CORDYCEPS: Too clever for their own good").
        ```
