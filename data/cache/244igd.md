## [D] Mekaku City Actors - A potentially more rational anime

### Post:

I started watching [Mekaku City Actors](http://myanimelist.net/anime/21603/Mekakucity_Actors) yesterday and I was surprised when I saw some flags marking a good anime. The show is about a group of kids, each with a unique power, and some mystery involving all of them.  

The real kicker to this show came in episode 3 when I was shocked to see the group devise and execute a rather well thought out plan in what I would call a rational manner. There was a problem, they knew there environment, they gathered information, they dealt with sub-problems, and ultimately they solved the problem. [I wrote a big post](http://myanimelist.net/forum/?topicid=1158765&show=120#msg30325745) breaking down the plan, pointing out important aspects, how it was created, and potential holes (all of which could have been covered). It was a treat to watch these events unfold and if it continues this maybe one of the best anime I've ever seen.  

I mentioned how the powers were really interesting. Its not really a spoiler to say they are, so far, all based around perception. Its also not really a spoiler to share what powers are revealed by episode 3 but I'll spoiler tag this anyway. [The powers include](#s "the ability to make oneself and surrounding people imperceptible, the ability to read people's minds, the ability to alter ones appearance, the ability to petrify on eye contact, the ability to draw the attention of others to oneself, the ability to judge where one's attention lies and what would impact that attention.")  
These powers all strike me as being very subtle and I love how they are all based around perception. None of these powers are directly offensive which is important when the group has to resolve a conflict.  

This is a Shaft show so if you know the Monogatari series, the style is in the same vain as that. The style is really unique and I guess I'd describe it as minimalistic, and really clean. 

A potential downside is that it has a lot of talking, so maybe be ready for that.

  No.

  Just watched first 3 episodes because of your suggestion, but there is nothing particularly clever or rational within that plan. And it was very simple.

  There are many anime with serious rationality themes, but this one is not one of them (yet).

      [This thread, for a start](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/20r0yo/looking_for_a_rationalist_tvanime_series_q/). Only thing I'd add is *Legend of the Galactic Heroes*.

        Yep, and I definitely agree on LOGH. The battle analysis is awesome.

  Yeah, I dropped mekaku after watching ep 3 because of how terrible it is. I wouldn't describe it as having particularly rational qualities at all, either. I'm quite surprised to find that someone percieved it in the way you did.
