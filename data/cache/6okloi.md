## Question: Morals of a traveler through an unlimited multiverse.

### Post:

Preface: I'm not sure how to tag this, so if someone could let me know, I'll edit the post.

A short time ago I was reading an SI fic on SpaceBattles about a guy who is given an alien device that allows him to travel through the complete multiverse - everything that was ever dreamt of in man's imagination and beyond, etc.  He spends his time creating an Empire of Man, pulling tech from all over the place - Star Wars, Star Trek, BioShock, etc, and sets himself up as Emperor, Warhammer 40k style.

Thing is, it's specified by the author many times that his device has access to *everything*.  Every possible universe ever.  All of them.  And this bothered me, because I am convinced he didn't think of the implications.
His Empire only ever accesses one iteration of these universes, and if he messes up contact, oh well, on to the next fiction.  
But there should be infinite variations of each one of these universes, created when some schmuck decides to tie her left shoe first instead of her right, when some other random person scratches their nose or doesn't, when a swallow beats its wings 7 times or 8 during a landing...and every other possible variation brought about by quite literally anything.

So anyways, I have a lot of problems with is implementation, but this led me to the following moral question:
In a multiverse where you can easily and quickly jump to the next universe over literally any time you want at zero cost, to what extent are the current set of human morals still relevant?
In one universe, a woman crosses the street and is hit by a bus.  Would a hypothetical traveler be morally obligated to perform a jump and save her in the next 'verse over?  
When there are an infinite number of copies of people both dying and not dying, succeeding and failing, experiencing net-happiness or net-sadness, what obligation, if any, can there be on an individual able to travel between these?

EDIT:

Reading replies and thinking about it more, I think this question isn't actually a unique scenario in terms of the ethics involved, and can be debated using the exact same arguments one uses for non-fictional situations as well, rendering the subject, interesting as it is, largely moot.

  A particular universe in such a multiverse would be defined by its complete history.  Given that travel between universes is possible and that every possible universe exists, it follows that universes with every possible intervention (including none) at every possible moment of time already exist.  

  The woman is going to be saved in various universes by every possible combination of people, and pushed in front of the bus to begin with by every possible combination of people, and you will and won't decide to save her anyway.

  In short, no such obligation exists unless you feel it does.  Do whatever you think is in your enlightened self interest however you define that, which is really what we try to do anyway.

    If you want morality in a known infinite multiverse, you have to abandon consequentialism. Virtue Ethics and deontological systems work just fine, even better if your infinite multiverse includes libertarian free will. Consequentialism loses its intuitive appeal when all possible worlds necessarily obtain, though.

  No it isn't. Alex is limited to fictional worlds he knows about that had mass appeal before he got the trans-dimensional technology. Visiting a particular world also prevents him from accessing other worlds that are too similar.

  How do you distinguish between a travel method that takes you to already existing worlds or generates them on demand? You can't and each have diametrically opposed moral imperatives. One wants you to travel to utopian universes and avoid bad ones, the other tells you to try and fix as many hell universes as you can.

    You are correct.  I misremembered the details of the story.  I suppose I would edit my question to a hypothetical scenario that fits the details I described.
    (I still don't think he uses his abilities efficiently, though.)

    The question, though, assumes as given the principle that these worlds all exist already.  It's a hypothetical, since that cannot actually be proven.  
    In that instance, is he really obligated to fix as much as he can?  Any more than us creatures stuck on the "default world" setting are obligated to ease the suffering of others?  Or does his superior ability imply superior responsibility?
    ```

    - u/MrCogmor:

      I already answered that in my previous post. If you assume that the myriad worlds exist already (and there aren't infinite worlds for every possible intervention) then both the Golden Rule and plain Utilitarianism would dictate you maximise positive intervention. 

      (Possible counter: You may not be required to save people from death who have a living identical replica depending on how closely they diverge. You would still be morally obligated to prevent suffering however)

      Most hardcore utilitarian approach would be to get 'identity optimal' universes filled with computation running simulations of all possible Boltzmann brains with non-negative mental states and destroy all non-optimal universes.

      Enlightened Self-Interest wouldn't really obligate you to anything since you would be basically untouchable.  

      Basic human psychology wouldn't really obligate you to anything because of the scope insensitivity bias.

  I think you might enjoy the second half of Harry Potter and the Irrational Odyssey (specifically an arc which starts somewhere between Ch. 25 and Ch. 30 (I'm not sure because they haven't been written yet, and there are three arcs before that which might end up getting "tightened up" and losing a chapter or two each)).

  EDIT:

  As far as your moral dilemma, I think each "instance" of a person is separate. There's an infinite number of "me" typing these exact words, but they're all discrete entities. If the girl from The Ring crawled through my computer screen as I was L:Ksdj;lakfsjgasfklbvgaskjvg

  Just kidding, universes like that are exceedingly rare, but if I *did* get killed to death, I would take no solace in my dying moments from the thought that an exact replica of me in a nearby universe was still alive and happy. You can't jump in front of an infinite number of buses, but that doesn't mean that any pain/suffering you inflict is morally acceptable just because a copy of the suffering person is alive and well in a neighboring universe.

    I agree with your point, and accept your conclusion vis a vis inflicted harm, but the question still remains - to what length does a reasonable expectation of moral interference extend to when the person in question has access to extraordinary means?

    Now that I'm thinking about it more, I realize that the fantastical details of "universe hopping" and "infinite realities" aren't really relevant.  The question is essentially the same for any individual in real life that has access to means for creating well-being far beyond that of an ordinary individual.  Say, someone who has access to the cure for every form of cancer.

    I look forward to that vaguely implied point in spacetime when that becomes available for viewing, then.

      That's just the thing, innit? You're looking at a screen right now. There's a universe nearby where I crawled out of that screen like the girl from The Ring and you never got to finish reading this sentence because I killed you to death. The Ring girl is my go-to, because that's exceptionally implausible and also ridiculous; I can think of many more graphic and gruesome things that could be said here, but it feels very wrong to say them. The point is that Infinity means there's a version of you travelling through the multiverse doing things you would never do. There's a "me" in a universe that *exactly* resembles this universe who stood up and left this comment unfinished and got in "my" car and got on the nearest highway and drove for 12 hours straight then veered into oncoming traffic at high speed causing 12 fatalities and 37 serious injuries. Infinity is terrifying. But the question was "In a multiverse where **you** can easily and quickly jump to the next universe over literally any time you want at zero cost, to what extent are the current set of human morals still relevant?" If I could snap my fingers and land in Narnia, I wouldn't immediately strangle Mr. and Mrs. Beaver just because there's an infinite number of identical Mr. and Mrs. Beavers in an infinite number of identical Narnias. The current set of human morals are relevant to the extent that you yourself are a moral person.

      That wasn't as polished as it could've been. Eh. Point was made.

      > I look forward to that vaguely implied point in spacetime when that becomes available for viewing, then.

      A draft of a portion of the first chapter exists right now. The first four chapters might drop on Halloween or Thanksgiving (if I can manage to hold on to them that long), but if not then the first 10 chapters will all release on Christmas of this year. I assume the vaguely implied point in spacetime will occur some time after *next* Christmas.

  Did the author of this work stated anywhere that the setting of his fanfic adheres to Everett's many-worlds interpretation? Because if not, then it doesn't have to be the case. And it's just a theory after all, not a scientifically proven fact.

  Assuming that MWI is true, it would be pointless, because there will be nearly infinite amount of similar scenarios and the multiversal voyager wont be able to save all such people by himself. Also he wouldn't really save anyone, but just cause another branching of the universe into one where he saved the woman and one where he didn't.
