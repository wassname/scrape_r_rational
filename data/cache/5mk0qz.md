  An outside view like this really exposes the weirdness inherent in our culture. Well done.
  ```

  - u/Gurkenglas:
    ```
    I'm not sure distributing build artifacts is intrinsically perverse. If homomorphic encryption is possible, they should be able to continue this into the distant future.
    ```

      ```
      A thing worth noting is that this is not, despite appearances, an author tract. The protagonist is not "correct", he's just from a different culture with different priorities and assumptions.

      Amongst those priorities is that the software ecosystem he lives in runs a slower than light interstellar trading ship. From their perspective, software that you can't modify long after the civilization that produced it has died or passed out of easy communication range is a death trap and is to be avoided at all cost.

  You should cross post this to /r/programming and /r/programmerhumour
  ```

  - u/DRMacIver:
    ```
    I tend to stay out of those reddits due to reasons, but someone else is welcome to post them there. :-)
    ```

  ```
  I could *feel* the Vinge in the text miles before your inspiration. Well done. 
  May hexapodia be your key insight.
  ```

- u/None:
  ```
  I felt that it's the beginning of a story? 

  It's still an enjoyable short snippet.
  ```

  - u/DRMacIver:
    ```
    > I felt that it's the beginning of a story?

    It is, although the story is mostly going to consist of a lot of episodes of similar structure and length rather than having any sort of overarching narrative arc.
    ```

  ```
  The insane part is, a huge amount of software isn't even being delivered anymore -- the build artifact is generating a view with an attached API. 

  I imagine they'll see this as a way to keep the World Wide Web together on a planetary scale. If people can't download or make copies of software you can't let the network break. But it kills it when you have interplanetary scales. No one would wait eight years for the next web page to load.
  ```
