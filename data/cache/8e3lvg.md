  This one took a bit longer - I've been busy with work/life this week, as I had to give a talk, finish submitting a paper and stuff. Hopefully I'll manage to pick up the rhythm a bit for next one, but I am going through a bit of a period in which I have less energy (creative or otherwise), so let's see.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Thank you! I'm glad you're still working on this. A friend of mine recently got me to watch the original Dragon Ball, and now I'm glad there's a rational Dragon Ball that's still being written, and I hope that you'll finish it someday
    ```

    - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
      ```
      I very much hope I won't give up so soon! I can at least finish the Pilaf Arc for now, then I'll take a bit of time to think things over for the next one. I have clear enough plans for the future too, up to DBZ stuff, but they're not "just need to sit down and write it" detailed yet.
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        Wow, that sounds like a long task to complete! Do you have anyone helping you?
        ```

        - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
          ```
          Nah, all in my head, more or less. I guess having someone to brainstorm with would be nice, but while I do know people who are fans of Dragon Ball, I don't think anyone would follow me down *this* specific rabbit hole XD.
          ```

          - u/None:
            ```
            I'll brainstorm with you. You can message me with [Matrix!](https://matrix.to/#/@elonsatoshi:disroot.org)

            I hope when you get into Goku fighting people, the battles have less talk. Opponents shouldn't inform each other that they're going to shoot a super powerful beam at them. There's lots of room for making the fighting more rational. And suppose Goku has read Sun Tzu's Art of War?
            ```

              >  And suppose Goku has read Sun Tzu's Art of War?

              Well, to do that, *I* would need to read it first. Which I probably should. But anyway I'll avoid citing explicitly real authors since technically the Dragon World just isn't *our* Earth, and thus they never had any Sun Tzu to begin with.

              And thanks for the offer :). Though that means you get a bit spoiled beforehand :D. I'll get in touch when I have time!

                If you want brainstorming help, I'd be down too. This fic is really fun.

                  Would you be okay with just discussing ideas/concepts in general? I guess I'm at the same time interested in getting some inspiration and iffy about letting on too much about the ideas/twists I'm planning :).

  ```
  [new insta kill technique unlocked](#s " putting someone in a capsule house and closing it. And than close that in a second capsule. The safety measures would be needed to be removed. But fuck you Piccolo. And later Raditz, Vegeta, Nappa & Frieza.") 

  And I was wrong about Bulma locking out the Pilaf gang from the castle. (At least for now.)

  The soul explanation for the second law of capsule seems a little more of guessing, than deduction. Even if souls exist (Which they do in the DB Universe), the problem could still be biological. And scientists should be able to experiment with that. Also, bad way to find out, if something has a soul. I guess plants would survive, animals don't. Would an animal turned into a carrot survive being stored?

  [prediction 1 70%](#s " If bulma hasn't build a spoofer, she will now.") 

  [prediction 2 50%](#s " Bulma could go into the treasure room, lock herself in and summon Shen Long there. (He would probably destroy the room, but who cares and Bulma doesn't know.)") 

  [prediction 3 90%](#s " Someone will try to kill with capsules.")


  Maybe put the three laws into earlier chapters or at the end of this, when you upload the next chapter. It was really confusing, that Bulma explained stuff calmly after freaking out at the end of the last chapter.
  ```

  - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
    ```
    Also, a small note. The laws are inspired by similar laws that are hinted at in the GBA games "Legacy of Goku 2" and "Buu's Fury". They mention that no living being can be put inside a capsule, and that no capsule can be put inside a capsule. However they have someone who invents a prototype of capsule that *can* hold a living being, and also hint at some kind of disaster that would happen if you put a capsule inside another (which I removed because any disaster could as well be a weapon, and I didn't want to juggle with that possibility too).
    ```

  - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
    ```
    Check the time, it says "yesterday". That's a flashback, it happened the evening before, after the rabbit incident. That's why Bulma is so calm.

    Yeah, the soul thing is a guess, but that's the pattern. Of course, [that technique] (#s " would not be very effective against anyone fast or strong enough to just not let themselves be trapped inside a house, or break it before it can close. The process is probably rather slow from the point of view of one of the DBZ-level fighters, who have enhanced temporal perception").
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      I got that, after it ended. Yesterday doesn't help much, if there could have been a time skip.

      Just saying, consider using the power of editing. Personally, I don't know why it is there anyhow. They didn't use the capsule for anything, that would need to be explained with the laws.  The sleeping gas could also just be stored in one without stasis effect. So just put the laws on the end or where it should be chronological after everyone read it. [of course](#s " Bulma could have stolen the dragonball with a capsule, but I wouldn't know how, unless she has a spoofer.") And even if the laws were needed, introducing them in the chapter they are needed to explain stuff, would be close to a Deus Ex Machina.

      [worth a try anyway](#s " They should still try (here Piccolo your temporary castle, until we build you a worthy one. good sleep, master), and it would be better than Mr Satan's plan to ambush Buu on the toilette. I expected at least some(all) enemies to be too strong to be killed that way. Like Vegetto and the candy transformation.")


      But I'm just complaining, ignore me, if you think it has no merit. ;-)
      ```

      - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
        ```
        Personally I may edit if I ever do a "final" edition (like Eliezer did for HPMOR on his site), but I won't change an ongoing fic on FF.net, I'd be worried it would get even more confusing. "Oh, go back and read the ending of Chapter 3 again 'cos I added stuff" sounds a recipe for disaster. 

        I may need to make it more evident, but I don't think it's a deus ex machina because of three reasons:

        1) it's not really key to the solution of the chapter, after all Goku could have used the capsule to trap the gas anyway, the laws only say the time freezes which is relatively unimportant (he could subdue Shu in other ways)  
        2) while not stated outright in canon, it's a logical way to expect such a thing to work; as for the laws concerning living beings and other capsules, as I said elsewhere, they *are* inspired by some things that are said in the games, at the very least, and  
        3) they are groundwork for stuff that will happen later, so this chapter's events weren't the main reason to mention them. Being so early in the story, I think there's still some leeway for worldbuilding in these situations.
        ```

    I like this prediction thing.

    [Prediction 1 85%](#s "Bulma already knows how to make spoofers")

    [Prediction 2 ~85%](#s "The bag in the castle does not contain the real dragon balls.")

    [Prediction 3 70%](#s "Bulma already has Pilafs dragon ball as well, having swapped it with a spoofer. If there are weight sensors, either the spoofer has similar weight as the dragon ball or she used some other weight and left the spoofer right beside the pedestal.")

      It keeps your predictions for you, and shows you a nice statistic, of how good your precentage correlate to reality.

    > No, please keep making puns. I enjoy the titles a lot.

    I see you are a man of taste.

    Re: the Pilaf gang, while I've made my own changes of course, it's interesting to point out how this characterisation for me was partly influenced by how DB Super fleshed them out. In particular, showed them to be far more technically competent than we ever saw (they help Bulma repair the Time Machine), and Mai is specifically shown to be a serious "badass normal" when she wants to. Of course that doesn't count for much in Dragon Ball but that's her bad lot in life I guess.
    ```

    - u/SkyTroupe:
      ```
      I second the need for continued puns.

      I like your characterization because it makes me feel bad for the pilaf gang.
      ```

  - u/Flashbunny:
    ```
    Seconding the request to keep the puns. Chapter titles are inherently meta anyway - breaking immersion isn't a concern.
