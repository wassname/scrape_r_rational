## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

      This is the first I've seen Rational Reads. It looks like it has the potential to be a very useful source! But it also looks like nobody has submitted new works to it in a while.

      I'm going through and adding several.

      (Also... it doesn't have HTTPS, so don't reuse a password on this site, even moreso than normal.)

      Edit: I voted on and added everything I could think of that I've read, but it's still missing a lot. Looks like there hasn't been a big push to update it in at least a year. That means it's missing a fair chunk of stuff on the front page of /r/rational right now, along with a lot of LitRPG and Xanxia stuff from these rec threads. I estimate catching it up would only take around five rec thread readers doing the same thing I did.

      There are rational LitRPG books? Where? Could you list some?

      - u/CaramilkThief:
        ```
        There aren't many that are rational to the standards of this subreddit. Honestly, it's a preference thing. I personally am fine with something that isn't rational as long as it's enjoyable to me. But here are a few litrpg that have been recommended in r/rational in the recent past.

        * Ar'Kendrythist
        * Delve
        * Infinite Realm: Monsters and Legends
        * Shade Touched
        * Never Die Twice
        *  Menocht Loop
        * Blue Core (has explicit chapters that are labeled)
        * Blessed Time

        and a few more that I can't remember.
        ```

          > Ar'Kendrythist
          > 

          I've seen more anti-recommendations for this one, and I'd have to agree with them. It's got some pretty terrible main characters that don't do the story any favours.
          ```

          - u/CaramilkThief:
            ```
            That's probably true. I thought the author was pretty effective at depicting a middle aged dude. And besides, almost all of the initial problems with the story get resolved later on. It *is* a pretty slow story though (after ~900k words a year has passed), so I can see why people would lose interest.
            ```

            - u/Judah77:
              ```
              Middle aged dude is still wishy-washy and hypocritical at chapter 73 which is when I dropped the story.
              ```

              - u/CaramilkThief:
                ```
                Yeah exactly, and that's what I love about the story. The main character knows he has to change but he doesn't want to lose his core qualities. He tries to abide by both and ends up half assing both of them, and being a hypocrite to boot. Rationally he realizes his flaws, but in real life it's hard to change yourself. I'd say it's pretty realistic tbh, if not entirely rational.
                ```

        - u/The_Real_JS:
          ```
          I'm quite enjoying delve at the moment, but the chapters are quite short. Are any of these similar, but maybe finished or just longer?
          ```

          - u/CaramilkThief:
            ```
            Ar'Kendrythist starts similar, and is about twice as long. Also updates with ~14k words per week.

            Infinite Realm has more xianxia, and isn't as focused on exploring the system. Updates with 12-15k words per week in 3 chapters.

            This subreddit is also the wrong place to find finished works :)

            Other than those none of the other ones are that long.
            ```

            - u/The_Real_JS:
              ```
              I'm okay with xianxia. I'm currently reading Forge of Destiny, and it's pretty enjoyable. I took a break from it, and there's suddenly 100+ chapters to read.

  For various reasons related to COV, publishers have held off on big releases until this month. That means that September is a great month for books in general, and fantasy books in particular. If you like published fantasy (or feel like getting into it), it's a good time. Here are a few books, and their associated series, that you might check out.

  [A Deadly Education](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/609361/a-deadly-education-by-naomi-novik/) — A novel in a new series by Naomi Novik. I enjoyed her novel *Uprooted*, though I haven't gotten into anything else by her yet  
  [Battle Ground](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B089CLRRKR/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1) — *Dresden Files* is a great series about a wizard detective in Chicago. This book is the second half of a split novel, the first half came out a few months ago. The series is a little slow to start, some people recommend reading from the third or fourth book.  
  [Piranesi](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0865TSTWM/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1) —The last major novel, *Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell* by Clarke came out in the early 2000s. It was pretty amazing (and a massive doorstop). I'm excited to see what she's been cooking up for one trillion years.  
  [The Trouble with Peace (The Age of Madness, #2](https://www.amazon.com/Trouble-Peace-Age-Madness-Book-ebook/dp/B0847KH373) — If you ask my opinion (yes, I know you didn't), Joe Abercrombie might just be the best contemporary fantasy author. This is the second novel in a new series set in a (very) low fantasy world undergoing an industrial revolution. He's also written a young adult series that's pretty good. If you're looking for a place to start with him, I recommend his standalone novel *Best Served Cold*.
  ```

  - u/cthulhusleftnipple:
    ```
    Oh man, Sussanna Clarke wrote another book? I'd thought she was only going to do the one. I'll have to check it out.

  So I've just recently started getting into rationalist fiction. A couple months back I read Unsong and yesterday I finished Mother of Learning. Mother of Learning was really enjoyable for me because it helped scratch the time-looping itch left behind by finishing the visual novel [Raging Loop](https://store.steampowered.com/app/648100/Raging_Loop/). I mention it here in case anyone's looking for the reverse: something to scratch the itch of Mother of Learning with a story featuring an intelligent protagonist who systematically works their way through a time related mystery. I would highly recommend it, especially if you're already into visual novel stuff
  ```

  - u/Watchful1:
    ```
    If you're looking for another time loop story, I highly recommend [Purple Days](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/purple-days-asoiaf-joffrey-timeloop-au.450894/), based on Joffrey from Game of Thrones.
    ```

    - u/None:

    - u/CaramilkThief:
      ```
      Also steins:gate and steins:gate 0, which are visual novels. It's not that rational, but it *is* really enjoyable drama.

      To a point re:zero is also a time loop story. It has a really irrational main character though, so ymmv.
      ```

      - u/SkyTroupe:
        ```
        I would say the Re:Zero has a realistic protagonist in a time loop. He's not the brightest but he does eventually start trying to exploit the loops in a pro-active way. I feel like the way his time-loop power works is incredibly traumatic and would easily explain why he isn't exactly the most rational
        ```

          - u/CaramilkThief:
            ```
            Yeah exactly. He's deliberately made to be someone who is hard to root for. That works with some people, didn't work for me. I thought that Subaru stayed too similar to what he once was even after experiencing many traumatic deaths and loops. Purple Days is sorta similar in having an unlikable protagonist at the start, but in Purple Days Joffrey gets lots of character development in the first 10-20 chapters.
            ```

            - u/None:

                ```
                It's probably best that you know at least until the end of book 2 or 3. Some events come up that are best enjoyed when you know what would've happened otherwise. You can also just watch the first few seasons of the show (except the last one). It's a great show, except the last season. You can probably still enjoy it by reading it alone, but I think you'll miss the impact that Joffrey's character development will have without thoroughly stewing in it in the books or the show.
                ```

              - u/SkyTroupe:
                ```
                I would say you might get more out of it from not having read the books or seen the series. As you get to see a lot of plot devices fresh and many twists that readers of the books see coming will be even bigger for you. As someone that has read the books he basically does a lot of development about people and places that are only briefly mentioned in the books, so you'd be just as ignorant as the rest of us when he takes the plot to new places. And every time he does introduce a new character he fleshes them out pretty solidly so you're never really confused about who is who and why they're acting the way they are.
                ```

        - u/CaramilkThief:
          ```
          To be fair, the time loop mechanic in Purple Days is equally as traumatic. I thought the author of Purple Days did a really good job of showing how the time loop breaks Joffrey and then stitches him back. I wish that sort of thing happened to Subaru as well. It's not a story I enjoyed much, but it's still technically good.
          ```

          - u/burnerpower:
            ```
            The big difference is the length of the loops. Joffrey in Purple Days has sometimes years to decompress between traumatic resets. Subaru has less than a week at any given point. That said Subaru does get stitched back together after a pretty traumatic series of loops. I love Re:Zero though and I dropped Purple Days a few updates ago.
            ```

          - u/SkyTroupe:
            ```
            The light novels do a pretty good job of it but I believe the anime is more pressed for time so leave it out
            ```

- u/callmesalticidae:
  ```
  The *Young Wizards* series and other books by Diane Duane are [50% off](https://ebooks.direct/pages/flash-sale-this-week-at-ebooks-direct-everythings-50-off). 

  They may not be rational per se (I won't open up that can of worms, lol), but they're rational-adjacent, at least, and espouse some familiar values (most especially, "DEATH IS BAD").
  ```

  - u/jtolmar:
    ```
    One of the Young Wizards books features a planet with a silicon surface that becomes a computer and achieves sentience.

    Seemed like something this community would want to know about in a rec.
    ```

    - u/callmesalticidae:
      ```
      It does not, however, turn the galaxy into paperclips, which is pretty disappointing. >:P
      ```

  - u/sl236:
    ```
    Fair warning for those it may affect: these are jolly fun but even more overtly Christian than the Narnia books.
    ```

    - u/Weerdo5255:
      ```
      You know I never saw it that way, but looking back I suppose so. It's got the YA action and dichotomy of good vs evil, but the series was my first into to 'structured' magic as it were. Even though it's nowhere rational compared to anything recommended here. 

      There are a lot of people with Martyr complexes in this though, >!Nina, Bug-Jesus, Ponch.!< Not to mention the very, very clear universally ordained bad guy who was once a good one.... Huh man it really is kinda Christian. 

      Still I would recommend it as the YA it is, it's certainly got more nuance with ideas about growing up, dealing with things like death, first love, loss, and making friends. Not to mention it's one of the few stories where the reasons for power levels maintianing throughout is explained. New Wizards have more raw power, but less control and the scales tip as one grows. 

      Not to mention the Aliens introduced as part of the main group in book 4(?) are a riot. The acceptance of the cheesy Tropes of trashy novels for Wizards of Mars, and the teenage angst with that.
      ```

    - u/callmesalticidae:
      ```
      I don't know about *more*. 

      I'd put it at "more Christian than Middle-Earth" (which is still Catholic if you know where to look) and "less Christian than Narnia," personally. Somewhere in the vicinity of Madeline L'Engle's *A Wrinkle in Time* and other *Time Quintent* books. 

      (If it weren't for the Satan stand-in, I'd actually say that *Young Wizards* is more Jewish than Christian.)
      ```

      - u/TheColourOfHeartache:
        ```
        Please elaborate on that last paragraph
        ```

        - u/callmesalticidae:
          ```
          Speaking generally, Jewish philosophy is more "thisworldly," and cares more about life for life's sake, and non-human life (YW is very [Tikkun Olam](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Tikkun_olam)-minded), than Christian philosophy, where the emphasis on redemption and sanctification tends to warp even otherwise-life-affirming doctrines.  

          (It also reminds me a lot of old-style Mormonism, to the point that, if I didn't know better, I'd think Diane Duane was a Mormon)

  Two of the three sequels to Charles Stross' Merchant Princes series, Empire Games and Dark State, have been released. Only recommending in the recs thread for now since it isn't complete yet and ends in a cliffhanger. The third book Invisible Sun should come out at the start of next year. I previously recommended the Merchant Princes series [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5rrykz/the_merchant_princes_series_by_charles_stross/).
  ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    I second this rec, Stross had a lot to love, and writes about as close to rational fiction as you can get, particularly with his focus on logical extensions of the rules he's set up and making sure that everything is realistic.
    ```

  - u/SkyTroupe:
    ```
    Stross is the one that writes the Laundry Files right? What about this series is compelling to you?
    ```

    - u/andor3333:
      ```
      For the Merchant Princes: " It's deconstructive. An ordinary girl one day discovers that she's the lost princess of a magical kingdom and gets whisked away to a life of adventure... except that the "ordinary girl" is a 35-year-old journalist who has her own life, and the "magical kingdom" draws more from *Game of Thrones* and medieval Britain than it does Disneyland." Plus a lot of effort put into realism and eventually fully exploiting the abilities introduced.

      For Empire Games: Dueling alternate timelines paired with near future technology and a surveillance state.
      ```

      - u/SkyTroupe:
        ```
        Hmm. That does sound interesting. Empire Games is a parallel book series to Merchant Princes? Kind of like how Ender's Shadow was to Ender's Game?
        ```

        - u/andor3333:
          ```
          Empire Games is a sequel trilogy to the Merchant Princes series. I recommend reading Merchant Princes first to avoid spoilers, though I think it takes a few books to get to the dueling alternate timelines part. Omnibus versions are supposedly updated and better than the individual books, though I didn't read that version.
          ```

          - u/SkyTroupe:
            ```
            Ahh. That makes more sense. Thanks!

    I’m writing one now. It will be a Percy Jackson/SCP/Multi fan work. The issue with making a rational Percy Jackson is how irrational everyone is because of the fantastical elements. The novels are somewhat reflective of the modern myths which considering how old the gods and monsters are, makes no sense. You think thousands of years of experience would give the gods wisdom, but it doesn’t.

    For that matter how exactly do gods work? What does it mean to be a god of marriage or love or dreams? Where are the other cultures and their gods? In the fifth book of the series there’s this fight between gods and titans that could mean the “end of Western civilization’. There are gods of other cultures, where are they?

    Considering that it’s belief that creates gods in the books. Where is the Abrahamic God? He has 3 billion followers yet there are only Greek?

    My take on it would be to throw out a lot of the fantasy out. In the SCP lore there is a fight between two competing hyper intelligent/ hyper dimensional beings. One mechanical and one of flesh. The mechanical one creates artificial intelligences/machines to protect Earth from the nightmarish existences that the flesh one creates. Basically the gods are AIs (or maybe ancient humans that became the first demigods?) their divine form being machines the size of small moons) defending Earth from extinction that is the Lovecraftian horrors coming for them. Main story is that the 4000 gods of all cultures are fighting off the eldritch horrors of Lovecraftian lore. The demigods now are beings created (half machine/half human) that defend Earth from threats that get there..

    Though that will remove a lot of the kinks in the story I’m still working on some more that got generated. I should have a first chapter out in a month or two.

      There's always the classic cop-out - that they're shaped by belief in such a manner that they can't change from the people who made those mistakes, because those mistakes are fundamental parts of the mythos and thus the belief that they rely upon.

      One possible goal for them - possibly suggested by an outsider, given the nature of the problem - could be to overhaul those stories somehow, and improve themselves that way.
      ```

      - u/DrMaridelMolotov:
        ```
        I guess that could work. The thing is the original books were like that too where the gods suddenly gain character development after thousands of years. Kind of makes the main character seem like the chosen one which I don’t like (even though he technically is in canon). Also I never really understood what they did all day when they couldn’t help the heroes in the first four books. 

        I would love to see a version of “The Lightning Thief” where everyone realizes how stupid and insane it is to send 12 year olds to retrieve a nuclear bomb.

      The Percy Jackson universe has Roman, Egyptian, and Norse gods. I believe they had to deal with their own world ending scenarios at roughly the same time.

      I once read a Percy Jackson/Fate Stay Night fanfic where Percy messes around in a FSN universe where gods are ships/AIs. I think the AI/ship gods are a thing in something called Atlantic Lostbelt. It was alright.

          There's a crossover story between the MCs of the Egyptian and Greek series. The MC of the Norse series is the cousin of the one of the MCs of the Greek series. The Egyptian gods make a few references to meeting the Greek gods, and >!One minor plot turn involves a Roman soldier given an Egyptian burial, who ends up stuck between afterlives until the MCs free him to go to the Roman afterlife.

    I don't know of anything that stands up to Worm, but I have enjoyed reading [But Doctor, I Am Pagliacci](https://archiveofourown.org/works/21716713/chapters/51801295).

    It's a DC alternate universe story in which the Joker wakes up sane in Arkham, is told that the Batman does not exist, and then embarks on a well-reasoned quest to figure out what has gone wrong with reality.

    Aside from that, I second the recs for Metropolitan Man and Batman 1939.
    ```

    - u/kraryal:
      ```
      Thanks for this. I quite enjoyed it and the protagonists are way smarter than normal for a DC story. Be warned that it is on hiatus, but there is a lot and the author says they will get back to it.

    The Dr. Dire series by Andrew Seiple and the Wildcard series edited by George R.R. Martin.  Parts of wild cards are excellent, but there are no true main characters, it's more like a rogue's gallery of short stories in the same world.  Not sure if Neil Gaiman's illustrated Sandman would be considered super-hero, but it is in the medium (comics) and it's good.  Also the Watchmen (just one hardcover graphic novel) is one of the good ones.
    ```

    - u/TaoGaming:
      ```
      The Wild Card series (which I read back in the day) is basically a shared universe that GRRM edited. So yeah, the stories vary wildly based on the writer/character. There were gems strewn among the lesser pretty stones. (I can't think of any story in the first few books that was terrible, although some weren't to my taste. But its been decades and rose colored capes and all that).
      ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    I don't have anything exactly like worm, but here's some stuff that scratches some of the same itches that Worm did for me while being good enough that I can unqualifiedly recommend them:

    [Metropolitan Man](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10360716/1/The-Metropolitan-Man) The original rational superhero work by AlexanderWales, set in a somewhat AU superman. Discussion and use of (And well written use of) decision theory consequentialism, proxy conflict, and existential risk. Front warning that for better *and* for worse it's from Lex Luthor's PoV, so that colors the story.

    [Batman 1939](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/batman-1939-the-dangers-of-being-cold.27163/) One of the best DC AUs I've ever seen, or just AUs in general. An excellent series of stories, about batman, that genuinely feel as though they were set in the late thirties. Excellent writing and research, heavy focus on realistic result following from the premises, doesn't shy away from negative results but only includes them when they're sensible.

    [Spider-Liv](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/spider-liv-olivia-octavius-au-quest.53960/page-3#post-12218583) Excellent Spider-Man fanfic in an AU marvel setting; among others, Olivia Octavia as Spider-Person, here Arachne. Features transhumanism, politics, AI.

    [Assimilation](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/assimilation-young-justice-si.39011/) Somewhat self indulgent DC fic, but much better than pretty much everything in the glut of YJ fics. Makes heavy use of nanotech, transhumanism, and DC lore. Main character is not always fully rational but it's the kind of thing that I'd expect people on r/r to appreciate.

    ______________________________

    These aren't really similar to worm at all, but I do think they can stand in terms of quality.

    My Hero Academia is a fairly textbook Shonen Superhero story, but it's a well executed example of such. It doesn't have much in the way of new ideas, but if you like those there's a lot to reccomend it.

    One Punch Man is hilarious if you don't mind a setting not taking itself seriously. The protagonist is good, but the best of it comes in the secondary characters like King.

    The Incredibles and Into The Spider-verse are the best two mainstream superhero movies in the last few decades, if you're looking for something more mainstream.
    ______________________________

    If you're in the mood for more worm, I can reccomend some fanfics for it, starting with [Impurity](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/impurity-worm-au.64859/) and [A FInely Honed Blade](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/a-finely-honed-blade-worm-kara-no-kyoukai-garden-of-sinners.32454/), but I could go on so I'll hold off unless you're interested.

        I've been reading that one recently as well. I love the detail put into the 1930s scene-setting, and the character building (of main characters as well as mooks) is stellar.

        However, I would caveat that the beginning built up my expectation for a fairly rational story. Thus, the second half felt disappointing due to (in my opinion) overuse of tropes and the scarily competent opposition suddenly picking up lots of idiot balls. It's still an enjoyable read overall, though.

    Citadel: Training in Necessity is, as far as I’ve read (book 2, ~chapter 35), an excellent superhero story.

    https://unillustrated.wordpress.com/monster/

    Book 1 is primarily an exploration of powers and training a class of heroes, while allowing for plot development & progression amidst dramatic tension.

    It is at least rational-adjacent and might be considered rational (I’d have to re-read to confirm, but it was posted here a fair bit years ago).

    Although it is on hiatus (since 2017) and incomplete, I still strongly recommend it if you’re able and willing to deal with the general disappointment of an incomplete work for the sake of the rest.

    A commenter on the site said:
    > New readers don’t let the hiatus scare you the story just entered a new arc before the hiatus begun you can enjoy the story up to now with no regrets.
    ```

    - u/fljared:

      Seconding the Citadel Rec; It manages to handle a variety of characters in a great way, along with a clear discussion of the effects of superpowers on the world. Does "Grim" and "Dark" without "Grimdark" is a very satisfying way. Two books are available as e-books as well

    Nope not at all, so now I just read worm fanfics :)

    I did however find one series that hit some of the same notes. Chronicles of Fid has Dr. Fid, the world's greatest supervillain, fight to save the world. The main character's pretty edgy and the story is an age old cliche, but it's a fun romp regardless. He comes off adult in his edginess, and his development isn't as straightforward as it could've been, which made it interesting. It's also complete at 3 books on amazon. 

    For worm fanfics, recently I've really enjoyed Brockton's Celestial Forge. It's a tinker OC fic, with the powers being basically Inspired Inventor lite from worm cyoa v1. It depicts characters well, and while the main character is increasing in power really quickly, he's still shit at dealing with PR and politics, which means conflict ensues! It's really good, and updates with 10-20k words every week.
    ```

    - u/lsparrish:
      ```
      I love Brockton's Celestial Forge. Crazy how good the story is, given its premise.

      Basically the new powers get added based on word count with a random component (dice based, I think). It's a heck of a pavlovian reward mechanism for the reader, and I assume the writer as well.

      I really enjoyed the Shocker when I read it a few years ago, though the female characters felt shallow and one dimensional and the writing gave me a sexist vibe. I couldn't give you any specific examples of it, but the fact that when I just googled him and saw that he has had multiple sexual assault allegations against him, I can't really say I'm surprised. Again, I read this a few years ago, so I could be remembering incorrectly.

    I enjoyed the Ex-Heroes series by Peter Clines. It's not very rational per say but deals with superheroes struggling in a post-zombie apocalypse world.

    The Reckoners series by Brandon Sanderson is a fun take on superpowers.

  Any good rational stories where the reader always has approximately the same amount of information as the perspective character? Just started Worth the Candle, and I’m loving that aspect of it. Rational isekai in general would be nice, since isekai tend to be like that.
  ```

  - u/CaramilkThief:
    ```
    I think you're gonna have to look for stories that are mostly or entirely from one pov. 

    Dungeon Crawler Carl is sorta like that. We always read from his pov, so anything we learn he learns. He also tries to be smart with his decisions, although from time to time he makes emotionally charged decisions as well. 

    Miles Cameron's Masters and Mages mainly follows one character, which leads to reader having same info as character. It's not entirely rational since the magic in it is more mystical and people more emotional. 

    In Ar'Kendrythist we almost always follow the main character (with side story chapters from his daughter at times). The perspective character isn't rational, but the world is.
    ```

- u/Zayits:
  ```
  I’m probably missing a comprehensive advise thread on the same subject somewhere in there, but do you know any books or series similar to Mother of Learning - not necessarily in the sense of making magic just a technology that doesn’t work in real life, but in its mood?

  I’m not sure what exactly I’m talking about; maybe it’s the gradual and thorough establishing of obstacles and well-founded overcoming of them, maybe it’s more the general optimistic view on problems, one that acknowledges the existence of the insurmountable ones but leads the story‘s conflict to hinging on the solution of the more mundane ones. Or maybe it’s just the cinical person’s coming to terms with other people having just as complex and valid motives as themselves. How would you describe that?

    Personal finance is surprisingly simple. First, check out the /r/personalfinance [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics) and follow the [flow chart](https://imgur.com/lSoUQr2) (if you're not American there's likely a version for your jurisdiction listed).

    For equity investing, there are a few widely-accepted stylized facts which you should be aware of.

    * You basically can't outperform the market. A lot of very smart people with the best credentials are paid a lot of money to try. Some of them succeed, but not consistently, and it's difficult to tell if they just got lucky over a short period and are about to revert to the mean.

    * Corollary to the above point – there are some things about investing you can control. You can control what mix of assets you invest in – which will have different expected returns and behaviour. You can control the fees you're charged. You can't control the actual returns of what you invest in.

    *  Salespeople will suggest that because their product has outperformed over x number of years you should be willing to pay higher fees to invest in it. Generally this is wrong. Past performance does not reflect future results and there are a number of strategies in the active management industry to make it look like their product is worth the fees. One of the most classic is to start a number of funds (ten or more) with different investment strategies and wind down underperformers. After five or ten years, one of them will have outperformed the market by chance, and this will be the one they're pitching to you ten years later. The fact that this has performed better than the market by chance in the past does not mean it is likely to perform better in the future! 

    * Because of this, the best investing strategy is to invest in the broadest possible basket of companies at the lowest cost, typically using broad-market mutual funds or ETFs. You accept that market returns are fine for you (keeping in mind that market returns are much better than what the [average equity investor receives](https://www.thebalance.com/why-average-investors-earn-below-average-market-returns-2388519)).

    There are also some popular niches like real estate investing, which actually are complex.

    /r/personalfinance also has a good list of [reading material](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/readinglist) which you should check out.
    ```

The fact that this has performed better than the market by chance in the past does not mean it is likely to perform better in the future! 

      That reminds me of an early email scam I read about. It promises to sell a program predict football results (presumably for betting). It works like this. 

      You start off with a large dataset of active emails. Before the next match, you split your set in two and send two emails. The first group has team A win, the second has team B win. The email says this is a free trial and you can buy latter when convinced.

      No one is going to be convinced by a single correct email prediction. So before the next match, you take the email set, throw away those you gave incorrect predictions, divide the remainder between Team C and Team D and sent out the predictions.

      This contains on and on, with people believing you've successfully predicted many matches. Your software must really work!

    Do some research on the FIRE movement, economics explained recently made a decent video on it. There's also a youtube channel called two cents.

    &#x200B;

    One thing to keep in mind is to be aware of BS and people selling you BS. Beating the market is virtually impossible long term, anything or anyone that claims being able to do so is +95% certainly lying or something very close to it.

    Check out /r/financialindependence and /r/personalfinance (or the personal finance subreddit specific to your country). They're good starting off points for saving and investing strategies.

  Anyone have any SI recommendations?

  - u/None:
    ```
    What are your requirements / What are you looking for, and what are your standards? There are a fair number of "pretty good" SIs, but the list of ones I'd consider great is much shorter. The intersection of these fics and rational fics is near nil. I've got a list here of all the great and/or rational ones, plus a smattering of the better ones among the rest. If you're willing to take isekai too the list expands a good deal.

    [Worth the Candle](https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/25740126) Rational LitRPG SI, original setting. Probably the only SI on the list that I would describe as definitely rational, though some are arguable.

    [Assimilation](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/assimilation-young-justice-si.39011/) DC SI fic, but much better than pretty much everything else in that category. Makes heavy use of nanotech and transhumanism, rational adjacent.

    [Santize](https://archiveofourown.org/works/20721824/chapters/49228244) Naruto Warring States period. SI competence comes from a realistic comparative advantage and believable advances, good writing. Fair warning on lots of OCs.

    [Dreaming of Sunshine](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7347955/1/Dreaming-of-Sunshine) and [Vapors](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9855872/1/Vapors) are two of the best naruto SIs. They're pretty long but quality is maintained fairly well throughout, if you just want to ig into an SI fic for a long time and not let go these are your fics.

    [Abolish Private Property](https://archiveofourown.org/works/22408759/chapters/53538715) Naruto SI, 3rd war perior. I did not know I needed this fic until I found it, but I did. Not as serious as some of the other works here.

    [Eye of the Gorgon](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/eye-of-the-gorgon-fate-grand-order-si.610048/) Fate/Grand Order Self Insert. Has the serious advantage of not trying to overbloat the main cast and not starting in Fuyuki, both of which I have 0 tolerance for because everyone tries them. Solid premise as well.
    [But it Won't be Easy](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/but-it-wont-be-easy-sw-si.832994/)Star Wars old republic SI. Sith SI, but like, the author doesn't drink edgelord sith kool-aid so it's a way better execution of the premise than the norm.

    [Sunshine Superman](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/sunshine-superman-1960s-marvel-si.847345/) 1960's Marvel SI. Doesn't really have anything exceptional but it updates frequently and has solid writing.
    ```

    - u/CaramilkThief:
      ```
      Here's some more that I've found to be pretty good:

      [Brockton's Celestial Forge] (https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/brocktons-celestial-forge-worm-jumpchain.70036/) is a Worm fanfic where the SI is the shard. Technically not SI, since you follow the pov of the main character Joe, but he's written well enough that it might as well be SI. Does characters and incremental power advancement really well and updates frequently.

      [Going Native](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13398050/1/Going-Native) is DC/DBZ SI, except the SI gets almost all his Earthly memories and behaviour beaten out of him through Saiyan culture. Explores Saiyan culture and politics pretty well, and it's a good crossover of the Frieza Force into DC.

    You're probably gonna have to lower your standards for rationality. Usually in books you'll find a combination of emotionally charged decisions and emotional characters. Not much room for rational decision making there. 

    Most of Brandon Sanderson's works are internally consistent and have believable societies and munchkin-ing. However a lot of people don't like his prose and direct way of storytelling. Still higher quality than most webnovels.

    Joe Abercrombie's stuff isn't entirely rational, but his character writing is top notch. To the point where all decisions feel in-character and justified. 

    Robin Hobb's character writing imo is even better. Her main Fitz series books are her most well known works. Fitz himself is pretty stupid though, and keeps making the same mistakes while telling himself that he'll get better next time. Similar flavor of suffering as Joon from Worth the candle.

    Murder mysteries are probably another good place to find rational books.

    Vernor Vinge's Zones of Thought series is pretty good, of you're looking for non cringe transhumanist rationalism exploring alien minds and technology with consequences.

    I've never read/watched any of the works you've listed, but "intense earnestness and simple heart" sounds like a good description of [Pale](https://palewebserial.wordpress.com/about/), Wildbow's latest webserial. It's about three girls who are brought into the world of Magic by the Others of their town, to investigate the murder of one of their number. It's a lot less grim than Wildbow's other published works, and even though it takes place in the world of Pact, it doesn't require knowledge of that story. It's been written  explicitly for people who haven't read Pact, and won't feature any cameos.

    If you're looking for dnd munchkinry the only story I can think of is the [two year emperor](https://www.dropbox.com/s/w6279gwfusrdcsx/The_Two_Year_Emperor.zip?dl=0%EF%BB%BF)

    The webcomic [Order of the STick](https://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots.html) has a similar feel to it and good quality, from a DnD side. I'm not aware of anything in HP fanfic area that gets a similar feel.
