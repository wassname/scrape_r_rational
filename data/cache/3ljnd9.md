## [BST] You have the power to make anyone find you unnatractive. How do you use it?

### Post:

(This is crosspost from [writing prompts](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/3lj6qh/wp_you_have_the_power_to_make_anyone_find_you/). )

I'm wondering how it would be possible to exploit.

  Go to James Randi and hope he doesn't steal it.

    Alternately, if you have power incontinence, go to James Randi and hope he steals it.

    This is pretty much the winning answer to any power prompts. Including the last phrase.

  -If it works on photos, billions of obvious practical uses.

  -stay unattractive by default in social settings - only date people who are nice to you before you turn it off for them

  -enter beauty contest, turn it on for everyone except the people judging, trollololol

  -Sell cosmetics and health products door to door, with the most brilliant before -> after demonstration they've ever seen

  Go into politics. Selectively convince your opponents that you are ugly (while maintaining a good appearance in reality) so that the remarks they make will fail to resonate with voters at a visceral level. Whenever possible, bait them into making remarks about your appearance.

    I think this is the best answer so far, and also the explanation for why "can't you do that anyway by doing something gross" isn't an answer.  The difference between making yourself unattractive this way and just doing something gross is that someone who finds you unattractive because of this power can't communicate why they find you unattractive; as far as everyone else is concerned, you are just being victimized for no reason.  And appearing to be an unjustified victim can be useful.

  I've got years and years of experience with this power and still haven't found a use for it.

  Don't we all have that power? You just do something gross in front of them.

  How does this signal of attractiveness propagate? If they think about me in another room, do their memories of me change when I activate it? Does it happen instantly, at c, or slower?

    Could be a variant on "Plateau Eyes" in Niven's "A Gift From Earth".  Basically, it was a psychic power that made people lose interest in you. They forgot you were there. This one is like a weaker version.

    Niven came up with a kind of hokey superficially plausible mechanism for it, involving contracting the target's pupil triggering a conditioned response because when you are less interested in something your pupil contracts. The logic doesn't really work, but the character in the book who came up with it wasn't a scientist.

    Anyway, it was purely line of sight. People had to see you to lose interest in you. That would be a cromulent mechanism for this.

  If you can make yourself sufficiently unnatractive, you could theoretically drive anyone away from you for any reason. The obvious application is robbing banks stark naked (besides for gloves) so that they can't even review the security footage to determine who you are.

    Be cautious of the Dunning-Kruger effect -- your answer may only seem obvious to you.

  Okay. So first of all - I assume that by default the person is attractive, otherwise it's not a power, just an unfortunate situation.

  Another point - if you can use this power on everybody around you all the time, that means you can be unattractive and suddenly become attractive.

  Where switching between attractive/unattractive modes could be useful?

  - Obvious one, you could prevent yourself from being raped.
  - You could make people underestimate you, and when necessary - suddenly become attractive. (can't think of an example where it could be useful)
  - Does unattractiveness work by magic feromones, or by changing your appearance? If it changes your appearance - you could have a great disguise, like a second body. For example you could commit a crime as an ugly person, and evade police as long as you want as an attractive one.

  That's all I've got for now....

    These are good, but I don't think unattractive people don't get raped.

    Huhm, I wouldn't mind reading a story about someone who believes they have this power and are intentionally choosing to be found unattractive until the key moment, but then discovers the unattractiveness was In Them All Along.

    Oh. You can use it to condition people. They'll never figure out how you're doing it. They'll just think you're really expressive or something.

  I would use it to power a civilization of infinitely immortal beings!

  The human brain is a mesh of neurons and synapses firing, right? If someone's opinion changes, that must entail some sort of new pattern of neurons and synapses firing. The prompt implies that no outside stimulus changes, so the only way I can see this working is if I caused a neuron (or neurons) to fire that wouldn't have otherwise. Which I believe implies I created energy out of nowhere.

  So how do I power an entire civilization for eternity? Because I consider a "person" to simply be an information process. If that information process runs on a silicon computer (or some furuistic-y replacement) instead of a mushy carbon one, I still consider it a person. Soooo, if that mind happens to run on a computer that ran on a bajillon (Totally Scientific ^TM ) Gigawatts, that would mean the virtual neuron I caused to fire would produce a massive amount of energy.

  BAM, true immortality via the (literal) power of our feelings!

  Assuming that it doesn't change your appearance in any way, and simply changes how people react to your appearance...

  You could use it to:

  * avoid unwanted social interaction

  Aaand that's about it. I'm not making any assumptions about default appearance, only that this power just makes people find you less attractive than they normally would. 

  Being ugly doesn't affect the world in any real way, except one thing: it makes a lot of other people instinctively want to avoid interacting with you. If they're polite enough, there isn't even that much of a difference; and if you can do something really well, the respect they gain for you makes up for being unattractive, for a lot of people. 

  This means you can only exploit it if you *want* to avoid social interaction with people. 

  However, this has applications. 

  See, if you do something annoying or infuriating, being ugly makes people react that much worse to you. 

  So what you can do is associate yourself with something or someone you dislike, but others don't; then, you can do mildly annoying and/or infuriating things to turn people against you, and them by extension. 

  You can use this to get out of being raped. You can use this to make people leave you alone. 

  You can even use this to attract attention, depending on how unattractive you can make yourself seem. Especially unattractive people draw attention to themselves. 

  Really, that's about it. That's all I got.

  ```
  I demonstrate it to James Randi and claim the million dollar prize, and then cooperate with whatever further experiments we come up with to track down the source of this power and exploit it.
