## [WIP][HF][RST] Avatar The Last Rationalist: Chapter 8

Hi all,
Sorry for the long delay. Life has been in the way of getting this resolved. Just a quick question: Why couldn’t Earthbenders just summon spikes underneath firebenders feet? Wouldn’t that instantly win them battles? I’m having a hard time justifying why Earthbenders just don’t do that.
Thanks for reading!

  I think the problem you may have is in perspective. 90% of the earthbending you see in Avatar is from Toph, who is an earthbending genius, or Aang, who eventually becomes one. [This video](https://youtu.be/t6ISa9pUEN8?t=370) (started at a relevant timestamp) seems to imply that your average earthbender has more difficulty with fine shaping--they can pull up rock in "natural", square or circular shapes, but anything more complex like that looks like it's already pre-cut. They also only manipulate earth pretty close to their feet before shooting it out, which could imply that actively shaping further off earth is an advanced technique.

  So it may well be that the kind of instantaneous fine shaping that those two pillars of earthbending can do is just straight up impossible for the normies. Most other earthbenders shown also only can shape one piece of earth at a time, so maneuvers like making an instakill bear trap would be impossible for a singular bender, setting aside the possible distance issue.

    Yeah seeing all those earthbending moves it seems obvious now all the secondary and tertiary Earthbender characters need to bend the earth close to them rather than far away. Thanks for the video.

  Welcome back!

  There's plenty of limitations you can throw at an earthbender, like skill in shaping, aiming accurately at an active enemy combatant's feet (small surface area), difficulty of bending earth into spikes quickly enough, enemy tactics against a known earthbender (constant movement / keep earthbenders' feet off the ground -relatively easy for a firebender), line of sight limitations (blind/hide with fire).

    Thanks for replying. I guess I’ll go with skill in shaping, aiming accurately, and line of sight. It’s just I saw the scene where Toph fought Aang and other Earthbenders and she was summoning spikes and different shapes the entire time.I thought every Earthbenders could do that considering she could do it at 12 but I suppose she’s also a prodigy.

      Pfff, Toph is only the greatest earthbender to ever live or something. Using her as an example would demoralize the heck out of any other earthbender.

      "Earthbenders can nail your feet to the ground" is statistical miscalculation. Most earthbenders can only move the ground under your feet. Toph Beifong, who's so good at earthbending she invents new disciplines from scratch, and pins your feet to the ground while mocking you with sand puppets, is an outlier and should be excluded.

  I'd have to agree with all the other posts pointing out skill in shaping. Not to put too fine a point on it (cough) but think about the shape of a spike of rock jutting from the ground. It starts with a small, sharp cone which widens to a solid base. Consider how difficult that would be to perform compared to a square or round protrusion of constant section.  The wide, solid base would need to push up through the ground, displacing or bending the surrounding dirt, while creating a vacuum behind unless additional bending were to create vents.  So either one extremely powerful thrust of bending or two or three separate bending efforts. All that along with correct aiming, fine shaping, and enough power left over to do damage.

  Theory about why there are those pre-defined shapes (most often a circle with a square in the center, earth nation symbols) that seem to be preferred by regular earth benders: perhaps the surrounding material is some very porous dirt or gravel or even finely shaped stones with vents to alleviate the vacuum issue. The shape could also be pre-bent into the short cylinders so all the bender needs to do is lift the stack and take the next slab.  Come to think of it, spurs of rock would need to be bent under the stack to keep it from falling back down. 

  Earth bending seems to have a lot of mechanics that require thought to appear as it does in the show, much more than the other elements.  Not necessarily power or control, just sheer mechanics.

  I’m so glad this story exists, it’s great
