## Essential rationalist fiction?

### Post:

I’m new to the genre and looking for core recommendations for rational fic. I have already read HPMoR, Mother of Learning, Metropolitan Man, and am currently reading Practical guide to evil. I would appreciate the insight of the community. Thanks in advance :)

  There is a community wiki, though I can't ever seem to find a link on the sidebar since the site layout change. Here is a direct link to it:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index) 

  There's a section called [Defining Works](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index#wiki_defining_works) that has a lot of good options. The ones that immediately come to mind (outside what you've posted) would be:

  * Pokemon: Origin of Species (ongoing - Pokemon universe)
  * Worm (completed - original superhero universe setting, pretty dark and depressing (IMO) but many people love it and it's spawned tons of fanfics)
  * Animorphs: The Reckoning (ongoing... I think? I stopped reading it. Animorphs universe)
  * Luminosity (completed - retelling of Twilight, with a second much more original sequel)
  * The Two Year Emperor (completed - DnD universe)
  * Worth the Candle (ongoing - original setting that brings a lot of tabletop and RPG staples into play. One of my favorites)
  * The Erogamer (ongoing - original setting with erotic-themed "Gamer" powers. "Quest" format. DEFINITELY NSFW. You need to create a free account to get to it. It's fantastic, though) 

  There are also weekly Monday Recommendation Threads that are full of good suggestions. Often not completely rational, but a lot of rational-adjacent stuff is good too.

    > Worm (completed - original superhero universe setting, pretty dark and depressing (IMO) but many people love it and it's spawned tons of fanfics)

    Literal tons. I've been spending the last month and a bit digging through fanfic. I think I've gone through like, 3.5% or so?  
    Let's just say there's a lot of fucking fanfics.

    Anyways, to expand on Worm and why it's "rational"...

    - First off, the main character munchkins the fuck out of her ability. It's something that defines her.

    - Secondly, the setting is created to be rational. The author sets up a starting goal of "People have superpowers" and an end goal of "people get them because of psychological trauma", and every step in-between can be reached from the one before. It's really enjoyable to just dig into the setting and find out more of it.

    Though, as I just said, "people get them because of psychological trauma". Worm is not completely rational. Even though there are aspects of what someone would call rational fiction in it, the story itself revolves around flawed characters and how they're flawed.  
    If you enjoy that aspect of the story, you'd probably enjoy the sequel a lot more than I did.
    ```

      ```
      > the story itself revolves around flawed characters and how they're flawed

      I thought this didn't exclude something from being rational, as long as the characters act according to their flaws? Or am I confusing some terms?
      ```

      - u/NZPIEFACE:
        ```
        Looking at the side-bar, this story leans heavily into the Thoughtful Worldbuilding side of rationalist fiction.

        Everything else is kind of more complicated to talk about, since people are complex.
        ```

    - u/phylogenik:
      ```
      > First off, the main character munchkins the fuck out of her ability. It's something that defines her.

      I feel like this is a common talking point but having read Worm I never really felt it to be the case. Within the context of a superhero reconstruction and given her near-suicidal starting outlook & >!shard-induced conflict-drive!<, she comes up with some clever fighting strategies, but imo & iirc never really uses the OP multitasking abilities or mundane utility of her powers to much effect. She eventually uses it to read lots of texts in parallel (it's like Naruto with the whole shadow clone thing -- wholly underexploited), but never, like, travels the country as a freelance exterminator commissioning herself out to big-ag as the world's most organic insecticide, or rapidly clearing bedbug infestations from fancy hotels, or w/e, making a few hundred million and commissioning some fancy, endlessly precise (insect operated) powersuits. Even putting on a costume at all seem to put a target on her back when she could just as well operate from several hundreds of feet away in her civilian identity, unbeknownst to passersby.
      ```

      - u/Frommerman:
        ```
        A couple of problems with these munchkins. First off, her range is two blocks. While that would be enough to remove all insects from a hotel, it's useless on the scale agribusiness needs. She could pollinate small specialty farms, not cornfields.

        Interestingly, she could make a killing growing pot, but that was never her interest.

        Second, anything she can do a specialized tinker can do better. She's more versatile than most tinkers, but for any specific application there'll be at least one tinker whose whole power is that application. Multiple tinkers in canon came up with extermination tactics to fight her, so she isn't the only person who can provide that service. Tons of tinkers/thinkers can have her level of battlefield awareness or better.

        Yes, her power would have insane mundane utility in our world, but the Wormverse has better ways to do all of those things.
        ```

      - u/signspace13:
        ```
        I had similar criticisms for her to begin with, but I feel like she does indeed munchkin her ability to a significant degree, just not in those specific directions. Due to the limitations on her powers and the instinct that Parahumans have by default, she does manage to use her incredible multitasking and diversity to great effect. >!By the end of the story she is the defacto battle commander for the mission that is intended to *save the planet* and attends almost every Endbringer fight as one of the core members of the direction and strategy teams, we don't see a lot of them but it is shown that she is very respected for these roles. She even manages to use a very niche aspect of her power to get good at something completely unrelated, shooting, which she is very good at due to the spacial awareness granted by her bugs.!<
        ```

      - u/Kaiern9:
        ```
        She utilizes her powers much better than anyone in mainstream fiction would. Not perfect, but miles better than any popular superhero fiction, which I think qualifies it as essential if you're into that genre.

        Side-note: I tried watching "The flash" on netflix, and my god, what hot garbage. If you're used to that level of ability utilization, worm would seem like a masterpiece of munchkinry.
        ```

      - u/VanPeer:
        ```
        It never occurred to me that it would have been safer for the MC to operate anonymously! I have seen the bug-terminator option at least mentioned in fan fiction but I have never seen the anonymous option explored. Huh, I wonder how much of my thought process had been conditioned by tropes.
        ```

        - u/GeneralExtension:
          ```
          >anonymously

          This is brought up in some fanfiction - in Weaver Nine, she is believed to be a thinking swarm of insects (and really hard to exterminate).
          ```

      - u/reaper7876:
        ```
        I will note that pest removal is something she canonically does, but it's >!something she does as a warlord instead of a freelancer, keeping diseases and such under control post-leviathan. She might have done it as a ward, too, but we time skip that so it's hard to say.!<
        ```

        - u/phylogenik:
          ```
          Hmm, I think I remember that, but more rat removal than bedbugs? More broadly though I think I’ve always found the ‘reed richards is useless’ trope to be among the more obnoxious (despite being required as a conceit of most street-level superhero settings, else they’d be a different genre). Except when facing immediate existential punchy threats, it seems like most superheroes’ comparative advantage aren’t in manually fighting evildoers, but in ‘earning-to-give’ lol, if not by funding social programs then at least by funding private paramilitary organizations. I guess that is what Coil does (though even then, partnership with larger organizations could have magnified his effectiveness tremendously, were he less motivated by the accrual of personal power)... the skitter case just seems like if Coil took to the streets as the vigilante ‘Schrodinger’, using his precognition to dodge left *or* right when engaging muggers in fisticuffs

            Yeah, _Worm_ was completely different from what I expected. When I heard "people use superpowers rationally", I was expecting something like [this](https://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/2011-07-13) or [this](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10503877/1/The-Amazing-Peter-Parker); a story starting from the premise that people get superpowers and having them behave like rational economic agents, maybe with a dash of effective altruism. Instead, I got the opposite; a story starting from the premise that something like the DC or Marvel universes existed, with people dressing up in spandex, taking on secret identities, and non-lethally beating each other up on the streets, and trying to come up with a way it could _possibly_ make sense. _Worm_ has several layers of justification to try to make it work (the unwritten rules, the way rogues are targeted, the nature of trigger events meaning that powers usually go to traumatized individuals, the inability of Tinkers to create technology that can be reversed-engineered or even maintained by non-Tinkers, >!the influence of Cauldron, the nature of shards to seek out conflict and preserve hosts' lives!<), but I'm not sure it does.
            ```

            - u/NZPIEFACE:
              ```
              Yeah, I was saying that the setting is rational, but the fic itself is almost the opposite.
              ```

              - u/EdLincoln6:
                ```
                People mean different things when they think "Rationalist Fiction".    
                There is the question whether the Protagonist behaves rationally, whether the universe is rational, and whether the author and/or protagonist preaches rationalist ideas.  Those are four very different things that don't all go together.

      Actually the author has written the next couple of chapters. He's sitting on them currently; he wants to drop the next few all in one bundle, and I believe he's working on the last one in the bundle right now. With any luck, we might see an update within the next couple of weeks.

  ```
  For continuations of HPMOR there's [Significant Digits](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11174940/1/Significant-Digits) or [Draco Malfoy and the Practice of Rationality](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11223914/1/Draco-Malfoy-and-the-Practice-of-Rationality). Or [Following the Phoenix](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10636246/1/Following-the-Phoenix) doesn't *continue* exactly so much as *branch off from*.

  For rational'd up fanfic based on other things, there's [Pokemon: The Origin of Species](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9794740/1/Pokemon-The-Origin-of-Species) (ongoing) or [Animorphs: The Reckoning](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11090259/1/r-Animorphs-The-Reckoning) (on a long hiatus)

  For other stuff that's currently ongoing that I'm following there's [Secret of the Patronus](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12975806/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Secret-of-the-Patronus) and [The Good Student](http://www.moodylit.com/index.php/the-good-student-table-of-contents)

  For "not really rational fiction, but quite good and somewhat adjacent to the community" there's [Unsong](http://unsongbook.com/) and various other little bits of [fiction by Scott Alexander](https://slatestarcodex.com/tag/fiction/) as well as the combined output of Wildbow on [Worm](https://parahumans.wordpress.com/), [Pact](https://pactwebserial.wordpress.com/), [Twig](https://twigserial.wordpress.com/), or the ongoing sequel to Worm, [Ward](https://www.parahumans.net/about/)

  For "not rational but it'll fuck with your brain in a good way" stories, I can also suggest [The Northern Caves](https://archiveofourown.org/works/3659997/chapters/8088522) and [Floornight](https://archiveofourown.org/works/2372021/chapters/5238359) by Nostalgebraist, and also [The Library Unpublished](https://archiveofourown.org/works/11539230/chapters/25908498) (which references The Northern Caves but is its own thing, but is also delightfully brainfucky).

  I can probably also dig up more (but potentially lesser) examples in any of the categories above, if one takes your interest in particular.

    Thank you for the wide variety of recommendations. I should have mentioned that I read Pact and Worm, but it didn’t occur to me.

      [Ra](https://qntm.org/ra) is pretty heavy on the magic-as-science angle, although I'm not sure how transparent _to the reader_ the rules of it are, even if the author was scrupulous about it. 

      But that also might just be that it all got complicated by the end; to the point where I started nodding along and taking it on trust rather than carefully parsing for full understanding.

    - u/true-name-raven:
      ```
      If you read pact and worm, read twig! It's not really rational (kinda) but it's an amazing story.

      Significant digits is okay. Still worth a read, but it's not on the same level as hpmor. There's moments when it feels like yudkowksky wrote it, and then others where the writing drags on and on.

      Magic wise, have you read the Imager series? Magic lets you reshape matter and move heat around. If there's not enough raw material or the conjuration is too complex, the spell kills you. There's only a handful of violations to this premise, and they're all established early on.

  [Lord of the Mysteries](https://www.wuxiaworld.co/Lord-of-the-Mysteries/1486806.html)

  Set in an alternate universe Industrial Revolution Europe with potions that gives you supernatural powers, involving a Chinese protagonist who found himself spiritually merged into the body of a dead university student with a hole in his head. The story is about finding out the mysteries of this strange world and constantly foiling the plans of evil Lovecraftian beings.

  The protagonist is extremely meticulous about things to account for Murphy's Law (in order to survive a world where mortal lives are as bubbles on the tide) and his thought processes are written in a logical and consistent manner akin to intelligent characters' "reproducible patterns of good thought" as mentioned on Yudkowsky's blog, with consistent creative usage of his powers as well as SCP-like sealed artefacts. What I've been most impressed by is that >!almost all of the anachronisms is eventually explained in-universe, including why one of the gods use the crucifix as his religious symbol.!< I can't recall any plot holes that aren't eventually addressed.

  The choice of words suffers slightly from being translated from Chinese, but it's still easily readable.

      Fanfiction is kind of a better fit for the genre, to be honest. The premise of "fiction without dumb characters, where the systems are self-consistent and everything happens for a reason" is just more satisfying when contrasted with existing popular fiction. Plus, niche communities tend to be more willing to discuss "low-class" stuff like fanfiction, which can lead to them *only* discussing them, as a method of distinguishing themselves from more mainstream communities.

      That all being said... I don't think fanfiction is nearly as prevalant as you're saying. Most of the ongoing series now are original fiction, and there are just as many (if not more) essential works that are original fiction as there are fanfiction. Plus, a lot of the bigger stories that are rational-adjacent have their own forums (r/parahumans, r/cosmere, etc.).

        TB is high-variance. Most people love it or hate it. The sex is mostly intense BDSM flirting and superhormones -> fade to black. It does a lot of mind-breaking torture and ***extreme*** Hurt/Comfort, and that tends to be what people love or hate about it.

        They are gratuitous in the sense of there being a awful lot of them. But they never really go into great detail, it never becomes porn.

        It's definitely a straight up teenage power fantasy, but it's a very well written teenage power fantasy. I'd say it's worth a try, but it's not a must read, so if you dislike it just drop it again.

        Ehhhhhh YMMV. It's a neat story and I enjoyed it in spite of the sex scenes, keyword 'in spite of'.

        It reads like an X rated, smart, precocious teenage boy fantasy.

        The world building and intrigue and the "fantasy elements taken to their rational extremes" tropes are all well done.

        - u/SimoneNonvelodico:

          Make me think of a story I read recently, "Winter comes". A Game of Thrones fanfic that is very blatantly and openly a self-insert power fantasy in which some guy get isekai'd to Westeros in the body of the Night King. Still, 'twas pretty fun - but it *did* have some cringey straight up porny scenes for no very good reason.

      - u/masterax2000:
        ```
        Personally, I think that if the sex scenes in Time Braid are gratuitous, then that word has lost all meaning. :/

        It's *really* not that bad, I think.
        ```

        - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
          ```
          I guess "gratuitous" has a bit of a range. The worst case is: complete tonal dissonance, sex scene sticks out like a sore thumb and feels like it was just put in because the author randomly felt like masturbating to their own prose. A milder case is, the sex scene is more organic to the plot but it still sort of feels like the plot bent itself over backwards in order to lead to sex as a plot point; which you could argue is another form of irrationality for a story, except instead of being in the service of, for example, having the main character be unreasonably successful, it's in the service of having everything resolve with people fucking for one reason or another. The totally-not-gratuitous case would be: yes, I can entirely believe in a situation where everyone is a thinking person this setup would lead to these characters having sex.

  I joined this group because I like sensible, pragmatic heroes and I like Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court books but I don't get a lot of original book recommendations for either here.

    WTC is fuckin grimdark evil shit (also quite good)

    I was taking about "The Gods are Bastards"!
    ```

  - u/WREN_PL:
    ```
    Google ~~"Worth the Candle"!~~.

    MIX UP!

    It's "The Gods are Bastards"!!!

    Absolutely, impossibly amazing, like if Terry Pratchett, Gary Gygax and Tolkien had a gene spliced child-from-a-flask combining best qualities of all their genetic material and upbringing.

      ```
      [[The Gods are Bastards]](https://tiraas.net/2014/08/20/book-1-prologue/)
      ```

  - u/Lightwavers:
    ```
    [[A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur’s Court]](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/86/86-h/86-h.htm)
    ```

  This site has some of the popular short stories.

  This TVtropes page includes a lot of the popular recommendations.

- u/pleasedothenerdful:
  ```
  In addition to everybody else's recommendations, [The Fall of Doc Future](https://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/82363551272/fall-of-doc-future-contents) (complete) (and sequels (one complete, one not) is excellent.



  So are Ra and Fine Structure at qntm.org, although FS is a bit rough around the edges (both complete). The Antimimetics Division stories at SCP, by the same author, are also terrific.


  It's not what I'd call a core rational work, but Everybody Loves Large Chests (in progress) is also great fun if you can get over the rapey bits.
