  It's a very libertarien setting...

  >Princess Celestia collected no taxes. It just so happened that the ponies of Equestria were wise and thoughtful enough to see that Canterlot needed a certain amount of funds to provide for the defense and support of Equestria. Any pony was free not to pay.

  >Nevertheless, Princess Celestia worried that the ponies who chose not to donate were unaware of the good things she could do for Equestria, and so she invariably paid them a visit to those who didn't contribute to her fund in order to advertise the quality of her product. Ponies are very proud of their immaculately well-tended gardens, so Princess Celestia would strengthen and focus the sun’s rays on the grass and flowers, making them grown tall and green. Then she would summon clouds as bright and fluffy as bunnies and heavy as flying boulders. With a burst of light from her horn a monsoon the exact size and shape of the holdout’s garden would crash down. When it was over, the garden bloomed like Eden on the morning of creation. Finally, Princess Celestia called actual flying boulders bigger than herself from nearby, which sometimes meant from miles away. She used them to add her own touch of feng shui to the garden.

    That's almost the Terry Pratchett version of libertarianism: "It's totally voluntary.  It's only a coincidence that I will smash your stuff with huge rocks if you don't pay, and that I refer to myself as royalty."

    Admittedly, it goes with everyone's Trollestia headcanon, but yeah, this whole thing is obnoxiously right-wing.

    For one thing, everyone knows the sun ought to be owned and controlled via a commons trust staffed by trained unicorns, and anypony caught referring to themselves as superior to others by race, tribe, or innate magic should be taken out and shot from a party cannon.

    Fucking right-wing capitalist bullcrap, man.

      I hope you're not a unicorn, comrade, or this could get *celebratory*...

        Well technically they're the only ones with the right equipment.  If *you* know how to upgrade the entire species to alicorn levels, go right ahead.

        And I'm a human being, so completely different part of the khiliocosm to deal with.

    The practical-minded ponies of Equestria aren't much interested in political philosophy. Still, whatever one thinks about the moral or practical correctness and utility of taxation, the truth of the matter is that tax collection has always been violent, brutal and cruel. Celestia's "voluntary" donations seemed like the most friendship-consistent way of portraying taxation.

    Glad you like the story. Twilight still has a lot left to learn.

  This is funny.  Thanks for writing it.

  Robin, if you proceed in ruining ponies, I will come to your house at night and ram a wooden stake through your brain.

      eaturbrainz is a comrade who thinks of capitalism as a human-unfriendly optimization process, much akin to evolution. If that didn't make sense you, have you tried reading [*The Sequences*](http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Sequences#Major_Sequences)?

      Robin = Robin Hanson, whom I am jocularly hypothesizing that you are.  He's a famously amoral economist, and a cryonics patient.

      Ramming a wooden stake through the brain = one of the only known methods of permanently killing transhumanists.

      Ruining ponies = putting hard-right-wing minarcho-capitalist economics in Equestria (which everyone knows is quite obviously Distributist, also known as "What you get when you ask a five-year old to draw a society despite his only having read Richard Scarry books.")

        *frowns*  You should know better than this - almost anything can permanently kill a transhumanist, if it happens soon.

          *Wooden stake.*  A *wooden stake*.  Come on!  Is the joke not getting through?  [Here](http://kitano25.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/e382a4e383a1e383bce382b8-11.jpg), how about now?  Getting through?

            For an *economist* though, you need something special.  Sunlight can drive off undergrads, and silver weaponry remains effective until postgraduate levels are achieved.  To slay a Lecturer, you have to burn the body on a pyre of gold-backed banknotes.  

            I've heard whispers that Nobel laureates may even be able to return from fractional-reserve cryptocurrencies...
