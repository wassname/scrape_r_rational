  Wow, this isnt easy... Poor Suzy.

    So is the god of magic going to step in or is he biding time, so he can nominate/appoint a new death once Suzie starves?

      That would be telling.

      I had forgotten about Shalious(sp?). He could help. Or maybe he wants do win the portfolio for himself? He does call himself 'the one true god'.

      I'm hoping Suze gets her shit together, somehow.

  ...Suzy is really, obviously, young, isn't she? I mean, wow. That is some good "show, not tell" in this chapter.

  If the goddess of secrets told *me* I should quit wasting time on the pointless revenge on random meat-bags and put serious thought and effort into reclaiming the loyalty of all my predecessor's clerics before I died of starvation, if it was me being told that? I might listen.

    She's 19, yes.  After running from Ellen and April she was feeling angry and hurt. She did what made that problem feel better instead of the longer term one.
    ```

  A few questions:

  -Is Suze trying to turn Death's agenda into something Lawful Good?

  -Suze's hunger is overcoming her rational though and self-control. Is it something specific to Death? So far, we know that Gods gain power through the number of worshippers and their prayers directed towards them. This extra 'need' either adds a new layer of complexity or contradicts that theory.

  -Where is Jake in all of this? He could grant her favors. Ultimately, Suze's agenda is in direct conflict with Jake's no-death-no-disease utopia project. I have a feeling Jake and Suze will have to form a contract of sorts, with Jake making concessions (as a God, she can take things from him).

  -Suze is now evidently weaker than the other Gods. If her power is proportional to how many lives she takes and how many undead there are, she will have to kill a lot more to gain Neklos' rank among the Gods. On that Jake contract again, and limitation on the number of Deaths would mean a limitation on her power.  

  -Why has Suze not gone through her power trip? I mean, interactions with people you can kill with a flick of a finger will eventually turn relationships vile and dislikable. They know their life is in jeopardy when approaching you, and you know they can't touch you and you can escape all negative effects of your actions. She has to, at some point, consider humans as playthings until she either considers herself as a God and humans beneath her, or pulls her shit together and establishes some rules. She's done neither, but since Godhood doesn't grant Moral Integrity +10, it's bound to happen.

  -Is there a God of Conspiracies and Secret Plans? If yes, what's (S)he up to?
  ```

  - u/eaglejarl:
    ```
    * Right now, Suze doesn't have a specific agenda aside from "stop whatever it is that's hurting me" and "don't die."
    * Right at the moment, Suze has exactly zero direct worshippers.  She's starving to death, sustained only by "ambient" sources such as the existence of undead, which is enough to stave off [CriticalExistenceFailure](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalExistenceFailure) for a while, but not forever.
    * Jake is over in Flobovia trying to upgrade an entire country (and, later, an entire continent) through the Singularity in under a month.  He would be happy to deal with Suze if she came to him, but he has no way to go to her.
    * Weaker...yes and no.  When she got the office, she was rank 20 because that was the level that it had just been at.  She has no direct worshippers right now so she's losing ranks as time goes on.  At the moment she's still got a boat-ton of power, but it's fading away pretty quickly.  She doesn't know how to *use* all of her power at the moment, but the power tends to take care of things for her (moving her around, killing people) when she wants something but isn't thinking about actually doing them...much the same way that you can catch a ball if you just reach for it, but not if you try to consciously think about how you need to move your arm.  None of the other gods would like to tangle with her right now, but in a few more days / weeks they might be up for it.
    * Suze *is* on her power trip.  She spent the first week learning how to handle the divine senses and such but since then she's been killing or torturing everyone who ever harmed her or anyone she cares about.
    * In the Forgotten Realms setting (canon D&D), Cyric is the god of intrigue.  The characters haven't told me whether there is one in 2YE or not, but I think the answer is no.
