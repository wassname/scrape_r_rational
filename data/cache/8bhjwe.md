  I have a feeling that Zona can consume entads. That would explain why nothing left and her condition for using the HTC.

    Oooh, that's why she is way smarter than she should be... Upgrades.

  - u/sicutumbo:
    ```
    The simpler explanation is that she hoards them due to greed or some similar motivation.  If she kills at a whim, lying about the number of entads to Joon and co. to stop them from looking for them would hardly register as immoral.
    ```

  - u/SpeculativeFiction:
    ```
    Makes sense. I wonder if she's the next/last party member. If so, she wouldn't be revealed so as to preserve tension, and because she has no interest in joining them yet.

    Then again, she's both too powerful, and rather restricted in location.
    ```

    - u/rabotat:
      ```
      >  rather restricted in location

      So's the locus, but then again that's precisely why I don't think Joon is getting another companion fixed in a place.
      ```

    - u/valeskas:
      ```
      > restricted in location.

      There was a bit of flying worldbuilding, Zona can move around, piracy cannons, and Fenn still needs an awesome hat. 
      So there is an intriguing possibility.
      ```

      - u/dalitt:
        ```
        If Zona can fly, that would be awesome — but what’s the relationship to Fenn having an awesome hat?
        ```

        - u/valeskas:
          ```
          I was playing Heroes 3 lately, and [Admiral's Hat](http://heroes.thelazy.net/wiki/Admiral%27s_Hat) was on my mind.
          ```

    - u/rmangalurker:
      ```
      If the theory that all of Joon's party member are princess, then Zona could be (related to) the real Zona from Uther era.
      ```

  ```
  > “We may be dumb, but we’re not that dumb,” said Fenn.

  Well done CRJ.
  ```

- u/PurposefulZephyr:
  ```
  So let's see:  

  * Another forge frenzy building.  
  * Explicit talking about a hidden theme, only revealed later. (Fallatehr and the identity theme of the prison)  
  * This forge frenzy mansion has a person living inside of for centuries, bored with repetition.  
  * Amaryllis is about to spend a long time inside a room, with little company besides books.

  There's some sort of deep thematic connection between those two...  
  Oh. Do notice how Tiff... changed, in various little ways, from how Joon remembered her. Also, we don't know how was she way back when, personality-wise.  

  The theme of this place is *changing with time*. Amaryllis won't come out the same person, and this time the change will be more permanent that random soul fuckery.
  ```

  - u/Kilbourne:
    ```
    How could bouts of extended solitary confinement *not* change someone? I agree.
    ```

  - u/xartab:
    ```
    Going with your premises, I think a more fitting theme would be *maddening isolation*.
    ```

- u/CouteauBleu:
  ```
  It's kind of scary how close to death the adventurers came in this chapter.

  The only reasons they're all still alive is:

  - They discussed the possibility of inhabiting Zona while in her earshot.

  - The fortress was too bored of killing people after all the people she'd previously killed to put serious effort into killing the adventurers.

  It's like a cross between *Tomb of Horrors* and the Heterodyne Castle.
  ```

- u/Makin-:
  ```
  Okay, some wild guesses despite my horrible track record.

  - Zona really is Uther's wife. She was turned into Kuum Doona after he tried to make her invulnerable to damage from The Plot. 

  - The dungeon master is an instance of Arthur (maybe Uther after becoming a god? who knows) and gave Joon Amaryllis to make up for the fact he basically stole his girlfriend.
  ```

  - u/WalterTFD:
    ```
    I don't think the DM is Arthur in any shape or form.  I could definitely buy Zona as Uther's wife though.
    ```

  - u/Kilbourne:
    ```
    I like your first guess but the second grates on me in some way.
    ```

  - u/GeeJo:
    ```
    The first guess is pretty likely:

    > “I am not a subject of Anglecynn,” said Zona. “I do not bow [to] its princes or princesses.” 

    If you were **Queen** of Anglecynn, both of those statements remain true without betraying the fact that you have a strong connection to the nation itself.
    ```

  - u/dalitt:
    ```
    Your first guess is my reading as well.  The implications of her looking like Tiff are...interesting.
    ```

    - u/narfanator:
      ```
      Eh. Amaryllis is an attempt at an "ideal" for June; Arthur pined after Tiff so if you were a lazy GodDM (heh) that's low-handing fruit for the look of an intended love interest.

      PS - Totally now calling the DM/God the GodDM, because "goddamn".
      ```

  - u/abcd_z:
    ```
    Or how about this one: Tiff was, somehow, Arthur's wife and "Zona" was just made in her image.
    ```

- u/sicutumbo:
  ```
  I feel bad for Taft. He just wanted to give tours and be with his wife. Instead he gets to see if the bottomless pit actually is. For everyone else that Joon and co. have killed, they at the least signed up for guard duty or an equivalent. Lots of the people they killed were also either evil in some way, or at least complete assholes. They generally knew what they signed up for. Taft had a cushy job acting as a tour guide.

  Anyways, I've forgotten a few minor things about some of the entads, and was hoping someone here remembers.

  Fenn had her artillery bow, and it has a limit on the number of artillery shots she can use. How does it recharge? And is there a limit to the number of charges it can hold?

  How does Grak's axe work? It makes his hair grow, but I forget what the condition is to use that ability.

  Is Ropey more durable than a normal rope?

  And I suppose one more question relevant for this chapter: Is Amaryllis planning to just store months/years worth of excretion in Sable? This would be an inconvenient time to discover whether Sable has a limit to its sorage capacity. I suppose she can dump everything into the pit every time she comes out of the HTC, assuming Zona allows it.
  ```

  - u/Makin-:
    ```
    If I remember correctly, Grak's axe makes hair grow wherever it hits, and he's used that ability to make hair appear over enemy's eyes and stuff. Presumably very light touches still work for self-use.
    ```

  - u/Permash:
    ```
    Assuming that sable currently holds all of the food/water/air she'll need in the time chamber, there's no reason to think it should run out of space while she's inside. The amount of mass in the glove won't actually be changing; it'll only be converted to waste.
    ```

    - u/sicutumbo:
      ```
      I actually didn't think about air usage (it wasn't mentioned explicitly so in retrospect it shouldn't be a concern) but my assumption is that she's going to be pulling food, drink, and anything else she needs from the backpack. The backpack *does* create mass, or at least teleports it from somewhere else, so if she stayed inside long enough she could find Sable's limits if it has any.
      ```

      - u/Permash:
        ```
        “I presume that you’ve brought your own sources of food, water, air, and waste elimination, as well as ways of providing for your personal hygine.”

        They briefly mentioned it there, but didn’t go into detail on how exactly air would be exchanged. I’d just assumed they would do it somehow with Sable.

        Good point on the backpack, I’d assumed they’d already taken everything she would need and packed it in Sable. If she relied heavily on the backpack and was incredibly unlucky, that could get pretty bad if Sable reached capacity.
        ```

        - u/sicutumbo:
          ```
          Wow I failed on a memory check there. Thanks.

          **Narratively,** I am confident in saying that Amaryllis won't die because she doesn't know how gas exchange works and never pulled something out of the backpack to convert carbon dioxide back into oxygen.

          Honestly, they should just let Amaryllis have everything they can provide her with. Including all their weapons. She has plenty of time to, say, get good with bows or Anyblade. It's not like everyone else will get more use of them in 45 minutes than she will in a month. 

          The backpack is especially great for her because she doesn't even need to cook, just pull out whatever hot food she wants. Same with books or items. I mentioned a wiki walk in my other top level comment, and I think it's a good analogy. She'll want lots of random information that is impractical to load up ahead of time.
          ```

          - u/Permash:
            ```
            I agree on the narrative part, it wouldn’t make sense or be interesting to most readers to have a whole section on gas exchange or waste disposal. 

            That ‘wiki walk’ would make for a really interesting dynamic if she came out incredibly knowledgeable about Earth, maybe even more than Juniper. We’ll likely see some of that as she plan’s Aerb’s technological revolution.
            ```

- u/sicutumbo:
  ```
  (I feel that this is separate enough from my previous comment to warrant a new one)

  I really want Amaryllis to come out of the HTC having gone through an equivalent to a wiki walk or twenty. Joon may be decently well versed on Earth's culture and some aspects of technology, but being in high school I doubt he really comprehends how advanced Earth is compared to Aerb. Aerb may have a few electronics, but is medieval in a number of ways. I want to see Amaryllis marvel at some of the things that modern Earth people kind of just take for granted. Intercontinental flight that is only subsonic because it's more fuel efficient rather than physical limitations, global communication, vaccines and how multiple diseases have been eliminated or virtually so, the luxuries that are available to even the poorest people in the first world, the wealth of information available about all aspects of nature, women's rights, the near complete lack of monarchies in advanced nation's, and so on. Hell, the entire concept of a globe Earth and orbital mechanics, since she lives on an explicitly flat one. Imagine explaining to someone on Aerb that we sent up some humans to another planet that's thousands of miles away, launched on a vehicle the size of a skyscraper that goes up due to a barely controlled explosion, that said vehicle was single use only, and that we thought it a valuable use of resources to send up a hammer and feather to test the known effects of gravity, and a mirror to measure the speed of light. Oh, and we also brought back some rocks. We did all this to prove that we were better than some other nation that we kind of sorta weren't at war with. Oh, and if we did go to war with that nation, it would probably kill everything.

  Data storage! How could I forget. Try explaining to someone who thinks of "computer" as a profession that we have devices that fit in your hand that can hold libraries worth of books, meter scale resolution maps of the entire planet, hundreds of thousands of paintings, and it's available with a few days' wages at the lowest you're legally allowed to pay people.
  ```

  - u/xachariah:
    ```
    Aerb isn't the Harry Potter magical world.  The biggest thing that will come up when Amaryllis reads up on Earth is that she'll be amazed by the lack of catastrophes.  "If we went to war with [Russia], it would probably kill everything" is really cute when Aerb really did have a thermonuclear war, and it ended up with nukes being excluded.


    Earth has advantages in the form of plastics and electronics, and everything else is inferior, at parity, or blocked by some aspect of Aerb.  (And possibly plastics aren't on Aerb because they don't have petroleum.)

    * Intercontinental flight - Worse than teleporting, plus dragons   
    * Global Communication - They've also got global communication  
    * Vaccines - Worse than Aerb medical magic  
    * Luxuries - We haven't seen Aerb be any worse than Earth  
    * Wealth of Information to anyone - Not an advantage in a world where knowledge is literally power, and power keeps killing billions  
    * Lack of monarchies - Aerb is superior if you live in a world where levels and stats are real, and arguably democracy is similarly untenable in said world    
    * Orbital Mechanics - A cute but useless endeavor on a flat planet  
    * Traveling to the moon - They already did that with an entire population  



    We've got arguably a better economy (although they've got some post-scarcity stuff going on) and better electronics, but Aerb isn't full of backwards rubes.
    ```

    - u/sicutumbo:
      ```
      For a number of your points, the results that Aerb have accomplished may be better, but I wouldn't say that the achievements are comparable. Intercontinental travel on Earth is accomplished through massive engines that push our knowledge of material science, aerodynamics, and mechanical engineering to their limits. These engines represent millions of man hours of testing, design, and analysis from some extremely smart people. On Aerb, some guy made these magic things one day, in a feat that no one can replicate, and now you can teleport. It's a similar story for vaccines, and space travel. The medical magic is more comparable to medical science, but I don't get the impression that they are siginificantly refining their knowledge of the field over time. Not to the same degree, at least.

      Does Aerb have global (or whatever the adjective is when the world isn't a globe) communication at decent speeds? They have radio, but I can't remember a time when messages have been sent across the world.

      I'm not sure what youre saying about your point on monarchies. Joon and co. are the only ones who have to deal with levels and stats.
      ```

      - u/xachariah:
        ```
        They've got helicoptors and airplanes; they know about aerodynamics.  They just can't use any of that because of dragons.  

        Aerb medical magic is post-singularity compared to Earth Medicine.  They can cure any disease that doesn't have magic backing it, instantly fix any wound, bring people back from being cut in half, etc..  A generic doctor can go get a bachelor's degree at the Aethenium of Bone, setup a practice, and heal people of mortal wounds for reasonable prices in an afternoon.  How much more advanced do you want?

        Aerb has global communication fast enough for information about Amaryllis to every keystone on the planet.  They can bulk send materials, and news (being inorganic) gets instantly transported.  

        ----

        Everyone in on Aerb has levels and stats, it's just that Joon can see the information on companions and he levels a lot faster.  'People' like Quills aren't just doing things that normal humans can do except better, they're performing genuinely superhuman acts like blocking bullets jedi-style.  High level characters are vastly more powerful than the common populace.  It's unlikely that 10,000 commoners with guns could deal with Aumann and his party.

        On an idealistic level, a philosopher king who is superhumanly wise and confirmed to be moral good is absolutely better than a democracy.  Such a person can't exist in real life, but is fairly straightforward to find on Aerb. 

        We know that wisdom and knowledge and cunning are stats, we can reasonably extrapolate that people have 60+ in a skill (because Fenn is amazing with a bow but isn't the best archer *ever*), and we know that takes at least 20+ in a stat to reach that skill.  Joon reached the point where his personality would diverge too much due to stats at 7 int/wis.  If you add it all up, this means there are people who are literally orders of magnitude more wise and intelligent than the general population.  Aerb also has ways to objectively measure morality.  Boom, philosopher king.

        On a practical level, democracy only works because of the implicit threat of force of the populace.  A state can only survive if it has a monopoly on violence, and democracy ensures that the greatest possible force (the majority of the populace) is always on the side of the state.  This comes crashing down if the greatest force isn't the populace, but a handful of adventurers.

          Maybe this is the PC/NPC distinction in this world:

          NPCs have stats, PCs have a progression system and get balance-brokenly-strong by adding points with every level up.

          Maybe by PCs I really mean just Juniper (and Arthur)

          I still think Dragons were added as an after thought, because the party needed to be on a train, cause story would not work on an airplane. Every chapter prior to train showed 0 evidence that dragons were somehow a problem with flight transportation\use, in fact helicopters\airplanes were used pretty freely. If dragons were in fact a consideration from the start, a lot of people and situations our heroes encountered should be the result of dumbest decisions that other people made.

            I really don't think that you like this story, and wish that you would go read something else rather than get annoyed by various elements that bother you. [I left you a comment explaining my stance on exposition](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/82v9go/rtwip_worth_the_candle_ch_8384_familiarline/dve5jgj/?context=3), and don't really want to communicate with you further.

            Dragons having a chilling effect on air travel was intended from the start; that passage was originally intended for ch 9, when they arrived at Silmar City, but I didn't like how it played with the pacing, given that it would have extended a "lull" in the text. You probably disagree; that's fine, but with due respect, I have my own opinions about how to write, and have disagreed with pretty much every "add more text" solution you've suggested, especially since the more I try to communicate, the more you find to criticize (which, again, I think extends from the fact that you simply don't like the story, and aren't of the mindset to enjoy it).

            > If dragons were in fact a consideration from the start, a lot of people and situations our heroes encountered should be the result of dumbest decisions that other people made.

            Your comments, especially lines like this, read as really rude and aggressive to me, as well as completely lacking in the principle of charity. Honestly, it really bums me out to get comments like this, and is one of the things that's made me stop reading or replying to comments as much.

              I read your March report on Patreon ([add more donation tiers](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8882ln/rt_worth_the_candle_ch_8687_headdown/dwjxz6l/)!) and I felt irrationally guilty when I got to the part about negative feedback since I'm a critical reader by nature. 

              More seriously, every writer struggles with negative feedback, but in Ace's case, it seems generally unproductive or incompatible criticism that you can't act on and it's wasted effort trying to respond when you're hounded by (often derogatory in tone) complaints of the same gist. It's a downside that comes with having an online presence as a web-serial author - people will dislike it and express it. Book writers talk about developing a thick skin, but they don't really have to deal with a bad review until their work is finished and the distance is already there. It might be useful to not treat all criticism as equal(ly reliable) or meriting a personal defense.

              If you're invariably fixated on the need to respond, then it could be constructive to get RES (Reddit Enhancement Suite) and set those comments on ignore indefinitely until it loses its immediate demand on your attention. I think dealing with these comments is more distracting when they're directed to your latest chapter than if they refer to some previous arc. At any rate, substantive criticism will recur and crop up again from multiple readers.

              I do dearly hope the negativity doesn't deter you from the comments because I've always enjoyed the responses and seeing how comments occasionally leave traces in subsequent chapters. Please don't ignore all the love!

                I don't have a ranking of readers, but if I did, you'd definitely be in the top five.

                A lot of the criticism I get stings, but is nonetheless helpful, or at least confirms my own understanding of what problems I've been running into. When I write I'm usually *really* close to the work, and unable to see how it looks from the outside; I've posted chapter thinking "ugh, that was garbage" only to have people say that they loved it, or I've been anxious about whether it was any good only to get great feedback. Sometimes stuff like "this scene didn't have clear enough or high enough stakes" hits me like an epiphany, and I instantly realize what the problem I'd been having was, I just hadn't been able to figure it out because I was mired in trying to use the wrong methods to fix the uneasy feeling I had.

                ... and then there are other kinds of feedback that are just negative without offering anything, or which come down to disagreements about what the story should be, or which point at trade-offs that I decided to make and just say "hey, there was a downside to that trade-off", which I already knew. Or people who just say "kinda garbage, didn't get past ch 11, don't understand why people like this", and logically, this is someone for whom the story didn't work, but it still kind of hurts to get rejected like that, even when you weren't trying. And yeah, some people are just assholes; I've gotten PMs from people that just wanted to let me know how much they disliked me personally for writing a story they didn't like.

                I think there's a limited amount of negativity that I want to let into my life, and that's why I've scaled back on reading and replying to comments, which I never did all that much to begin with. I don't want to dissuade people from giving feedback, even if it's negative, especially in a public place where it's meant for other readers or community members, not me. It's more the tone and form of some of that feedback that gets to me, which I'd rather not subject myself to.

            Hi /u/Ace_Kuper.  Your opinion here is pretty obvious; and you're entitled to have it and to explain it.

            However, we also have a rule "Keep /r/rational pleasant (and on-topic)", and the extent of your criticism is pushing up against that line.  Why not just accept that other people will enjoy stuff that you don't like, and skip over it?  There's just no need for an argument and nothing at stake here except for the community :)

            Could also be a question of altitude.  Long distance air travel is most efficient at high attitudes where the air is thinner, minimizing air drag.  The dragons could be more prone to attacking high things
            ```

            - u/cthulhuraejepsen:
              ```
              It's not really that dragons attack. You can run the numbers; there are five hundred dragons, and the surface area of Aerb is ten times that of Earth, which means that it's like fifty dragons holding the entirety of Earth's airspace. Each would be responsible for about four million square miles, or about a square about two thousand miles to a side.

              The *individual* odds of an aircraft being attacked by a dragon are, therefore, low, so it's not really a "don't fly or you will be struck from the air by a dragon" type of thing, it's more "an aircraft needs to fly pretty much every day, full of passengers, for three years, in order to pay for itself, which means 13,000 hours in the air before it's turning a profit. If the odds of a dragon attack are greater than 1/13,000 per hour, then planes are unlikely to make a profit. (And obviously a plane crash isn't just a matter of not being able to make a profit on a plane anymore, there are significant expenses involved in clean-up and liability, which can be handled by insurance schemes, but almost increase time-to-payoff for someone building or buying an airplane for commercial travel.)

              But the dragons *don't* really attack, they have a regulatory agency that constricts air travel to within certain quotas, times, and places, with various penalties for infraction going all the way up to "a dragon notices and destroys the plane and everyone onboard" (though it's more "one of the reporting apparatuses notices and informs a dragon" than a dragon actually noticing). All of that results in a chilling effect on aviation -- but not an actual *halt* to aviation.

                Hmm this is a very good explanation- I had not considered simply how few dragons were around.  It also justifies the use of helicopters in the two cases seen.  But why would they do the trial by adversity at the risen lands, since there is no little value there, compared to simple execution?  After all, if only one in 100 people make it back, the Host isn't getting much value out of the sure drops.

                Naturally, this isn't as much of a concern if dragons need to take substantial amounts of time arriving to an illegal flight- short, unscheduled flights will be back on the ground before a dragon can chase them down, and presumably ground based defense can take a dragon down at some level

                  One pathology of government is that there is no limit on how cruel or absurd (or even inconvenient to the state) punishments can be — politicians can almost always gin up some support by suggesting ever crueler and more labyrinthine penalties.  Anglecynn has a weird system of government, but I can imagine someone suggesting the drops in the Risen Lands as part of a “Tough on Crime” campaign.

              Sure, only no one even mentioned the Dragons when chapter upon chapter Juniper talked about him knowing how to fly a helicopter and wanted to take one as a trophy, no matter how absurd that was.

              Also, the story opens up with our hero dropping from a plane. Why would government waste precious "negotiate with dragons for a long time to fly anything" chance to dispose of criminals for little to no gain? It was kinda stretching the believability on it's own, but revealing dragons 80 chapters in only made me question every instance of the flight tech used in the series.

              Edit: There are other mechanics\aspect that appear as a problem\challenge\motivation when get dropped as conveniently as they were introduced. Is more the case of i see how the world is build as we see it, which is not a problem on itself, but aspect start to contradict each other so the plot could progress or the party finds a macguffin that circumvents very specific thing that was the crux of the previous couple of chapters. I'm reluctantly wait for one of those things to become way to noticeable and hope it doesn't happen. For me train chapter was very obviously written the way it was because it would not work otherwise.

      Juniper would be an interpersonal issue.

Several months of time spent together, cut off from the world, with perfect birth control already applied... that's a recipe for disaster if Joon values his relationship with Fenn. 

      Val is also an interpersonal problem.  
      Mary is less prejudiced to her than she was before and seems to have a good relationship with her now, but Val is still a terrifying boogeyman.  I don't see anyone but Joon willingly spending a month with her as solitary company.

  Putting pieces together. Most of what we get about Tiff comes from [chapter 42](https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/27769455):
  >“I did [like Arthur],” said Tiff. “And I knew that he liked me. I kept waiting for him to ask me out or even just confess to me, but months and months went by and he never did, and then my interest started to fade because there was this other handsome boy, so what was I supposed to do?”

  [...]

  >“Yeah, I am [an asshole],” said Reimer, rubbing his forearm. “This difference between the two of us is that I know I’m an asshole, and you prance around like you were his bestest friend in the whole world. You and Tiff could have told him, he’d have been upset but at least it would have spared him being made a fool of. He died a virgin, pining after her, and you were just laughing behind his back about what a moron he was.”

  So Arthur either didn't know or had only guessed about Tiff and Joon when he died, and she probably got the tattoo as a commemorative thing. Zona is Arthur's memory of Tiff, not Joon's. That's why she's different, Arthur didn't know her so well. She's also a locally omnipotent magical sentience that's been murdering people for centuries... which might tend to alter one's personality.

  Various thoughts- (warning - I'm a munchkin)

  Sounds like Kuum Doona is not the best permanent base after all.  "Tiff" seems unstable at best.  If they could win her over it would be OK, but I think Amaryllis is a lost cause.

  On a related note (from chapter one), CHA: Charm - How much people like you. Used to convince princesses, barter with barmaids, or plead for your life.  LOL, nice use of "princess" instead of "party members".  That said, I betcha that if Joon had more SOC, he would not have had any trouble using the chamber for free or having unfettered access to the fortress.

  It's increasingly clear to me that MEN/magic is the thing to focus on, for a few reasons


  * In general, having many different schools of physical combat is not so useful: you can't take advantage of your axe skills and bow skills at the same time, and trying to switch between them incurs a cost.  However, each magic can (in general) be switched between seamlessly.  Likewise, each magic taps from a different resource (although some, such as Gem, are distasteful).  Still and Revision magic seem especially useful for survivability.
  * Soon, 2-3 party members will have Symbiosis, so simply having the ability to use the bone magic+essentialism trick gives them a huge advantage
  * It makes the party far less predictable: nobody expects the bow expert to have crazy magic skills, too.

  On a related note, you really need to unlock and level as many magical skills as possible to take advantage of its potential.  This is likely actually quite easy, and the party is likely to finally have the time to do it once Solace brings the locus back.  In the simplest case, you just teleport into the city for the appropriate athenaum.  Creep around and find an unwitting subject who's out for a night of drinking.  From here, the options are endless!  

  * "I'm writing a novel with a water mage in it.  I'd like to have a realistic training sequence... care to show me just the very first exercise you were ever taught?  That's all I need, and I could make it worth your while"
  * Hire a water mage for some petty task.  Establish rapport in doing so.  After all is done, offer more money to get a 10sec lesson.
  * (act drunk, or be drunk)  "Dude, my friend's totttaaallllyyy full of himself.  He says he can pick up a bit of any magic just by trying the first exercise for a second or two... Wanna help us settle a bet?  I'll give you $10k when I win ;-)"
  * Creepy games involving using soul magic to copy the appearance of their best friend, seducing them, applying the fools choker on them, temporarily modifying values, etc
  * And then just pack up ASAP and teleport to a new city.  For all cases, give yourselves fake faces just to be safe.  Rinse and repeat
  * Getting this for fire and water magic seems like an especially good idea, in light of what I say below

  After doing that for any reasonable magic, it would be a good time to consider re-speccing.  Do the sacrifice again, but this time save a bit of extra skill so that you can boost skin magic as well.  Re-spec out of anything that you get from symbiosis, and likely into magics and things which your team does not have access to.  Use scar magic (skin boosted to high levels) + soul symbiote to give everyone scars (the soul symbiote has good synergy with this).  Focusing your points into MEN gives you extra flexibility here.

  Once your Soul magic is at a decent level, it might be a good idea to flip-flop your points back and forth between SOC and PHY, depending on the situation and provided that you don't lose virtues to do so.

  Likewise, since they'll have time after this, it seems like a good time to start building their technology base.  None of the exclusion zones are urgent matters and they have almost no immeadiate threats, so preparation is key

  Perhaps the right answer to saving the locus is simply to get Grak or Joon up to super competent at Warding, and extend the interior dimensions of the bottle?  Make the bottle larger on the inside and it'll be stronger, giving you more options.  Or just combine Art and Essentialism on some later Sacrifice so you can interpret what the Locus' soul is telling you.

  Magic is interesting in Worth the Candle, because it appears to be sorted into a relatively small number of related categories.  We've only really explored the first of these in depth, but I wouldn't be surprised if magics within a category are interfaced with in similar ways...

  * "soul":
  blood
  bone
  carapace
  ink
  pustule
  skin (scar, tattoo)
  essentialism (not quite the same)

  * "force":
  constriction
  still
  velocity
  vibrational

  * "elemental":
  fire
  flower
  glass
  ice
  steel
  water
  wind
  wood

  * "mental" (??):
  gem
  library
  revision


  * "unsorted"
  druidic
  gold
  spirit(?)
  ward

  Speaking of Spirit, I would have expected Joon to ask for a quick lesson in the Spirit blades after the rescue.  Doing so would likely unlock that telepathy trick, too.

    - u/munkeegutz:

      I guess you're right.  I thought of her as more like the prison, which was built for a purpose and then had value drift.  On a second read-through, Zona looks like she is an intelligence which is not bound to the bloodline, and is instead more like a "separate being who also lives there".

    - u/munkeegutz:
      ```
      I think you have a good point about speed, and likewise about SOC.  

      Really, it's a question of relative utility... Try to maximize the strength of the party per attribute point.  So there should be a strong bias for capitalizing on the advantages provided by symbiosis, which reduce the value of shared specializations.

      That's true, but he has a number of skills that he hasn't properly unlocked yet. Given some initial book learning, he should be able to unlock still, velocity, vibrational, revision, water, and fire magic. Then also get engineering and a few of his less used combat skills maxed out. After that, he can still do normal learning through the books stored in Sable or the backpack. He would be limited by the size of the room, and given that I doubt he could max out fire or water magic, but even some simple fire spells used by multiple people could provide a nice combat advantage.  There's also thinking of ways to use his current abilities better, rather than simply making them more powerful. He hasn't tapped into soul magic body enhancement significantly as of yet.

      There was another comment in this thread that I think makes a better case for why Joon shouldn't go in with Amaryllis. Fenn can't go in because she would annoy Mary way too much. Amaryllis is extremely attractive to Joon, and that attraction is returned to some degree. Joon and Amaryllis living in such a small confined space together, with basically complete privacy, is potentially very bad for Joon's current relationship with Fenn. It's best for him not to put himself in the situation in the first place.

      Hopefully, Fenn and Joon could use the room for a subjective month or week, where they could both train without the potential problems of Amaryllis and Joon sharing the room.

  Random thought about the parallels betweeen Zona and Juniper & co. They've been getting progressively more casual about killing people, even innocent bystanders like the pilot.

    Ideally it would stick

    >the end of which was attached to a length of thing, elven-made rope that had been purchased at great expense.

    A length of thin, elven-made rope

    ------

    My brain has opinions about commas; I don't know if those opinions reflect english grammar, so take those complaints with a grain of salt. LMK if those are too opinionated, and I'll try to stick to just typos next time.

    >It had been coined by Fenn, but the ‘tele-’ prefix meant ‘far’, and all arrows, almost by definition, were already traveling across great distances, and further, the telearrow didn’t actually go any further than a normal arrow, and in fact, due to weight, balance, and worse aerodynamics, tended to go quite a bit less far.

    I get that it's probably intentional that this scans poorly, but maybe if some of the commas were semicolons ("distances; and further", arrow; and in fact") it wouldn't be quite that extreme? I had to read this sentence three times to parse out which clauses were independent ;p (is 'and further' about the great distances, or a variant on 'furthermore'? etc)

    > Amaryllis had freed both her armors from the armor, while one hand rested gentle fingers on the glove, feeling its magic, the other held a pocketwatch, which was counting down the seconds

    "gentle" feels out of place there, did you mean "while one hand rested gently on the glove"?

    Also feel like you need either a full stop after armor, or some kind of conjunction after the comma. "Amaryllis had freed both her arms from the armor, and while one hand rested gentle fingers on the glove, feeling its magic, the other held" seems to scan better.

    > arrow fired against glass, metal, or stone, would be too likely

    Don't think the comma after stone should be there. "arrow fired against glass or stone would be too likely" -> "arrow fired against glass, metal, or stone would be too likely"

    >which would slow down the glove-carrying shaft of the arrow. A fast-bonding adhesive would then be carefully applied to the arrow before it was fired, and ideally it was stick to a wall, which would allow Amaryllis to get out of the glove, stick herself in place with the immobility plate

     in 'would then be applied ... before it was fired' the then seems off, messing up the chronology; 'stick' is repeated twice in short succession (try fix?:

    "A fast-bonding adhesive, applied carefully to the arrow before it was fired, would ideally stick to a wall, allowing Amaryllis to get out of the glove, fix herself in place..."

    > For that, Amaryllis had specialized tools, not just ropes, pitons, and a harness, all things she’d bought way back in Barren Jewel for the assault on Caer Laga, but a wound crossbow that she loaded with a heavy arrow, the end of which was attached to a length of thing, elven-made rope that had been purchased at great expense.

    don't think you need a comma between thin and elven-made; the comma after 'specialised tools' should be a colon, the commas around 'all things' could be hyphens:

    "specialized tools: not just ropes, pitons, and a harness - all things she’d bought way back in Barren Jewel for the assault on Caer Laga - but also a wound crossbow that she loaded with a heavy arrow, the end of which was attached to a length of thin elven-made rope that had been purchased at great expense."

    > The steel-tipped arrow was fired from its specialized crossbow, hurled across the relatively short distance separating them, then broke off part of the wall where it struck and fell limply down, trailing rope behind it until Amaryllis grabbed the end and began pulling it back up to reload it.

    The arrow changes from object to subject in the third part of the sentence, and I feel like you need to make that explicit; "then it broke off part of the wall where it struck", maybe? As is the transition is jarring.

      Fixed the first part. The second part I'll have to spend more time going over, a lot of it is stuff that just takes two or three editing passes for me to see. It kind of sucks that writing and editing take from the same pool of time and effort, because I do think I'm capable of writing prose at a higher level, the problem is that it comes at the expense of *quantity* of prose, which isn't really a trade-off that I want to make.

    I hope that they can negotiate to keep the glove, backpack, and teleportation stone. Everything else is replaceable to one extent or other, but losing any of those three would severely hamper their ability to do anything in the future. Losing Sable means that they have about a thousand pounds of gold that they would somehow have to store in a secure location that they don't currently possess. Losing the teleportation means they have no ability to actually get out of the pit, much less move around Aerb at a non-glacial pace. And the backpack provides huge utility in it's ability to just conjure food, information, and gadgets at will. It's an almost strictly better version of the clonal kit. All three have no replacement, while losing some useful armor or a versatile weapon is harmful but only mildly effects their overall performance.

  - teleportation key: high power level, very high utility; hard (but not impossible) to replace

  - storage glove (Sable): extremely high utility; sentimental value (Fenn)

  - Anyblade: low power level, high utility; 

  - Ropey: negligible power level, some utility, very high sentimental value (Joon/everyone?); should be considered a party member/friend

  - immobility plate: (apparently) infinite power level but narrow; some utility

  - artillery bow: only long-range "big gun" (especially with the void grenade trick) in a fight; might hold sentimental value (Fenn)

  - hairy axe: low power level, minor utility; might hold sentimental value (Grak)

  - fairy jar: medium utility, fairly redundant given Joon's healing powers

  - clonal kit: minor marginal utility since most things it produces can be produced by backpack or bought in advance and stored in glove

  - Earth backpack (?): medium utility; literally irreplaceable; provides access to the combined knowledge of a civilization

  - returnable dagger: low power level, negligible utility

  - countdown bow: low power level, medium utility

  - first-hit armor: high power level, negligible utility

          B: Zone does very much care what she eats, and will be picking on the basis of what will be most useful to her.. Which will sting, but is not optimized for being hurtful to the party - This could for example mean the cookie jar, the bottle of the six-eyed doe (dumping the locus back into the world in the process of claiming it) and the amulet of mind storage.

  I've been imagining Kuum Doona as Howl's Moving Castle ever since we found out it moves. Maybe I glossed over it, but I haven't really gotten the image of how it's oriented. It's more tall than wide, but is that height on the Y-axis? I'm imagining it looks like an encyclopedia pancaked against the wall with any cannons or towers built on the broad side sticking over the pit. So Mary climbed down the "spine of the book" onto the "bottom" where the door and the jutting walkway presumably sit right above the empty expanse of the Pit.

  > Most of the climbing faces had velocity wards beneath them, layered so that you would be slowed by degrees as you passed through them and hit the ground no harder than if you’d tripped over your own feet on ground level, which meant there was no need for spotters or someone to belay her.

  when my sister was 13 she tripped over her feet on a carpeted floor and shattered her forearm bones into several fragments, requiring years of reconstructive surgery

  it was not particularly likely but id want to make the wards a *bit* gentler

  Did something happen to the story? I can't access it anymore. It's killing me.  
  I love it so far, and have been eagerly awaiting the next chapter.

  So can Joon use soul magic and a marzipan fairy to fix Grak now?

  Second question, but why no vacation in the time chamber?

    Because the time chamber is the size of a small apartment, and would feel super crowded with the whole group in it. Not sure why they sent Mary alone, though. The ideal group size would probably be 2.

    In hindsight, I present the joint facts that Grak doesn't like soul interactions and that soul interactions can be useful. Seems like something we might have guessed in advance, really.

    Time for some more left-right bone mirroring?

  ```
  Wait, quick question. Do they still have the bottle/s of unicorn blood with them? They said they were gonna keep one, and we never knew that they sold it, as far as I remember.
  ```

  - u/CouteauBleu:
    ```
    Even without the blood, I was wondering if they could heal from whatever poison they took using bones or blood. It would probably be part of Zona's "game of cups", a la "One of these cups may be poisoned, let's not have the bone mage drink until she's cured everyone else".

      Although it seems like she could crush their skulls easy enough...

  I ship Amaruniper so I was hoping they would end up in that time chamber together. 

  But I'm a patient man, I can wait.
