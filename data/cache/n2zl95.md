  My largest issue with this depths arc begins in force here and will continue for a while, which is, they don’t seem very objective-minded. 

  I know, I know.  I am aware of my own writing style. Thank you.

  But seriously, they’re going into the most dangerous places in the world, and why?  Nominally, it is to find blues and kill them so they can all level up and become even more problematically powerful. But they’re treating it like a vacation almost.  Even Tallheart!  And he’s actually been fairly smart through most of the story!

  It’s not that every chapter needs a sense of urgency, but there is a lot to be said for showing more of the group progressing toward their goals and less of them hanging out, when the hanging out isn’t the focus of the narrative.

    It does make for ~~great~~ easy to write filler, though!

    I kinda stopped reading Delve at chapter 130, but... doesn't Tallheart basically have PTSD from being in the depths so much with his wife? Like, when he described it in an earlier chapter, it sounded absolutely hellish. 

    I could see him *eventually* relaxing, but this seems fast.

      My memory may not be entirely accurate, but I got the impression that he remembers those days fondly. Something like a "we were young, reckless, and doing dumb shit together" kind of way.

  “Ook,” Rain said, nodding. He gestured toward the branches invitingly. “Ook? Ook ook ook?”

    Love how far off the rails this story has gone.

      I love the fact that Patreons get notice of a missing chapter AFTER paying for the month. LOL

  I can’t believe there was really a part that lasted several paragraphs that consisted solely of Rain and then Amelia making noises like and acting like monkeys. I didn’t mind Rain’s awkward references and memes *too* much, but this just feels ridiculous. Aren’t they also on a super important mission to power Rain up in the very dangerous depths?

    It's two people in a relationship being silly with each other in a moment of not-crisis. I thought it was adorable; especially for me since I met my fiancee LARPing and this is the kind of goofy crap we do.

      The really notable thing about LARPing, though, is that when you get hit in the head with an enchanted sword, you don't die in real life...

  An update that throws some action in your face and asks new, urgent questions, followed by an extra week stop. And while having a backlog! I would kill to be able to have a backlog and post more regularly, I don't understand why with a backlog of this size he won't just keep up the normal updates.
  ```

  - u/Fredlage:
    ```
    Because as far as he’s concerned, the readers that actually matter are the patrons and he doesn’t have a backlog for them. Since they’re paying him for the privilege to be 8 chapters ahead of the rest of us, keeping the normal updates for us would force him to release two chapters in a week for them to catch back up.

      > Since they’re paying him for the privilege to be 8 chapters ahead of the rest of us

      Oh, uh, yeah. That's right. We all pay for that... privilege.

      I guess Senescent doesn't really care about feedback, since there's an eight week lag between when we can comment and when they might consider correcting track. Another contributing factor in why Delve has felt so dissatisfying and out of touch.

        Nah, patreon comments are generally in the same vein.

        Also I like how same week on Azarinth Healer author warned 2 days before end of month that one of biweekly updates on May will be skipped. And than delve says week off 2 days into May.

    As someone who writes with a backlog... well, the backlog is for patrons.  And the patrons actually pay for me to write.  Specifically, they encourage me to write at the pace that is comfortable and helpful to me.

    I do get it; public readers enjoy the story, and I enjoy their feedback.  I'm not making things because I *don't* want to share them, after all.  But at the end of the day, the people I give stuff to for free just aren't entitled to anything.  Non-patrons are welcome to enjoy my work at the pace that I decide to release it, but there's really no reason to actually put in extra effort to make those people happy.

    It kinda sucks, honestly.  But hey, that's just one of the many downsides of living in a capitalist hellscape.
    ```

    - u/DoubleSuccessor:

      Looking at it from a purely mercenary point of view though, surely the population of patrons isn't static, and the derivative of more patrons is probably pretty correlated with Royalroad ranking or whatever? I can't imagine missing a weekly update is going to help with that.

      Personally, I might not even bother with looking at the update in two weeks, and signal-boosty things like this reddit post might stop going up too with a pause.

      The patrons will certainly be epsilon happier to remain eight chapters ahead instead of seven for the foreseeable future, but does that outweigh the loss in future patrons from the community becoming different-epsilon more disinterested after the two weeks? I don't think the answer is as clear as it appears at first glance.

        Eh.  In business, it's generally better to maintain good relations with the audience that has shown a willingness to work with you, rather than try to court a potential new audience.  Some people are already paying you, and keeping them happy means they keep paying you.  The people who *aren't* paying you, especially in the world of webfiction, probably aren't going to start.

        The majority of my patrons joined when the offer to read ahead was first made.  I get a small trickle of new patrons every month, but those don't tend to line up to new chapter releases.  Instead, they're usually people who already were reading, and have hit the end of the archive.  Or who were already followers, but now have the money to be patrons.  Bringing in a new audience just isn't a thing that happens easily.  And even if it was, doing it at the cost of the goodwill for people who have already proven that they will be loyal patrons is kinda foolish.

        You know that trope where the villain promises a prisoner something, and then the prisoner is like, "alright, sure" and the villain goes "you fool!" and murders them?  And, okay, that establishes to the audience that the villain sucks.  But it also establishes in universe to everyone who knows about this, and everyone they'll ever talk to, that the villain cannot be trusted and you should never make deals with him.  Short term gain for long term instability, basically.

        As for this subreddit being a signal booster?  Well, it isn't.  Maybe it is for Delve, what with all the drama around it, and it certainly is for new stories when they first get started, but for basically anything else, it's more a place for people who are already reading to have more specific conversations.  There aren't an appreciable number of people on here aren't seeing Worth The Candle posts and thinking "I should start that".  People are coming here because they want to talk about Worth The Candle.  If that makes sense.

        That said, maybe I should start some kind of subreddit drama.  Drive the engagement numbers of my own work.  No such thing as bad press, right?

          As someone who very frequently goes on / off as a Patreon, for your work as well as Delve, I would argue that maintaining consistency is important on both ends; every reader has value even if they are not directly paying you. They are still reading your work, thinking about it, discussing it, rating it, and sharing it. This drives new business, so to speak, and there is definitely a positive correlation between free viewership and paid viewership. 

          Free readers are certainly less valuable than Patreons, but their value is not zero by default.

          There's a line that needs to be drawn here where *being paid in exposure* is an equitable trade for *work that does not have any additional cost to duplicate or distribute*.

          A big part of why I decide to pay any particular author, aside from interest in their story and access to a backlog, is their competency; which to me includes among other things having a good relationship with free readers.

          Keep in mind that **the first interaction any reader has with a web serial is as a free reader**. God knows RR authors *rarely* take down old notes, and new viewers do read those. I really recommend either removing them or just being disgustingly positive. Passive aggressive author notes are just blergh. But anyway...

          You've maintained that good free reader relationship well enough.

          Some authors have not--like one whose story was premised around a naked mage--and have done very poorly as a result; despite strong early viewership and ratings. And my $5. Fuck that guy.
          ```

          - u/ArgusTheCat:
            ```
            Oh, absolutely free readers aren't without value.  I should have been more clear on that, I agree with you completely.

            I probably ought to go take down some of my older author's notes.  But I also probably ought to go fix a few dozen typos.  There's a whole other reason for why the motivation on that is lacking, though, that's not relevant here.

            I think the biggest thing that turns a new reader into a patron at the end of the archive is actually how big the archive is.  The longer someone gets to read through for, before hitting the end, the more they become accustomed to having that "next chapter" button waiting for them, and the more it stings to have to wait until next Saturday to get it.  Time, and my increasingly caffeinated writing habits, will continue to build up a larger and larger free repository of story.  And a new reader coming into that, if they make it all the way to the end, is more likely to want to see more than someone who's not as in-the-moment committed.

            Also, while I love my public readers and their sometimes-great comments and more-amusing discord interactions, I don't really want to treat them as a marketing department.  Mostly because, and I say this with love, *nerds are bad at word of mouth*.  Not that it doesn't work out sometimes, but more that it's not exactly a reliable payment of that elusive quantity of exposure.

    I don't think the hunger was related to the slime in his soul. Based on the tight armour comment I'm betting the adaptation is making his body grow/adapt at a faster rate.
