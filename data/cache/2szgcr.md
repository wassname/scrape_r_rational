## [BST] [MK] What are some simple but cool superpowers that would have a lot of creative applications?

### Post:

I'm thinking on a story that will be about a school for superheroes, something like "HPMOR meets Incredibles".

So far I've figured that one of my heroes will be able to create portals, and another will have superspeed.

Now I'm thinking on some more cool superpowers that a person like HPMOR!Harry could invent a lot of creative applications for.

  If you have not yet read Worm, go read Worm.

  If you have read Worm, you will have no shortage of ideas.

    While it is a good read, Worm is *extremely long*. If you don't mind spoilers, there is good information to be had on Worm wiki pages.

        I got to 14 before I tired, left it for a year, and will probably finish it this time around. Weaver just got the call to go to New Delhi (23.4) to fight Behemoth.

        I like it. It's got people usually being pretty smart and inventive with how they use their powers. My main complaint is that some fights get really, really drawn out. Like the Echidna thing. It took *forever*.

    Off topic - can someone tell me the name of the phenomenon where superpowers can't effect people's bodies?

    I think Worm was the first story to explicitly give a name to the effect but I can't remember what it is...

  I'd recommend not giving anyone super-intelligence because it's very hard to realistically write about such a character since they would take actions you would have never thought of.

  Instead give people savant-like abilities such as perfect video-like recall, easily learning and doing insanely complex mathematical operations mentally, and can think far more quickly than other people. It's a lot easier to write since such a character will be a lot like a Hollywood rationalist who can recite tons of facts easily, but won't necessarily be any better at making decisions than other people.

  I would love to see someone who only has the power, infinite willpower. He/She can set for him/herself a task to complete, and the task will be completed ***no matter what***.
  ```

  - u/696e6372656469626c65:
    ```
    What do you mean by "the task will be completed ***no matter what***"? Certain interpretations of that phrase can lead to somewhat... overpowered results. (To be charitable, I'm assuming you mean something like no procrastination, no distractions, no akrasia, etc., but that line is somewhat ambiguous...)

    Also, does "infinite willpower" apply to things other than task completion? Like, say, could a character with that power resist torture indefinitely, for example?
    ```

    - u/xamueljones:
      ```
      Your interpretation is correct.

      I was mostly thinking of something like the hero can set a goal to be completed and a way to accomplish the goal. The hero will then work on reaching the goal as soon as possible. There is some leeway in that the hero can take his/her time and not destroy him/herself trying to complete something like "get strong enough to bench-press 500 pounds" in a week. But the hero will not feel as if it's a burden to get over with, but rather as something pleasant he/she would like to do (i.e. to be very motivated). However, if the hero can't accomplish the goal with an arbitrary amount of **will**, then the goal won't ever be completed.

      I did think of an interesting drawback where if it turns out the goal doesn't need to be completed any more, the power will force the hero to deal with an OCD-like urge to complete the goal anyway (like doing the laundry, but if someone else did it already, then the hero will still wash the clothes). But that means if a task becomes impossible to complete, the hero can go crazy trying to do it. Also if it's something like "fast for 50 days", the hero will kill him/herself doing so. It's a double-edged power.

      Hmm, using it for something other than task completion...I would say only if the hero believes it can be done at all. If the hero is cocky enough to believe he/she can resist torture indefinitely, then the power will make it happen. But if the hero thinks it is impossible, then the power won't kick in. To me, it's dependent on a good deal of introspection and knowledge about one's psych. A little Dark Arts in Rationality would be very helpful for our hero.

      Anyone who wants to use this idea can do so with no complaints from me.

    >***no matter what***

    I'm writing a fantasy book series. It will be a while yet, but this will eventually see play. There's a location where any oath voluntarily spoken becomes physically impossible to break voluntarily. So if you set yourself a goal and say that you will do whatever is necessary to make it true, that would do it.

    It can be (ab)used for other things too, but in terms of the Infinite Willpower thing, the third to last book will see the main character breaking into the location to give himself exactly this, and then things start to escalate about as quickly as you would expect when both sides are incapable of surrendering or changing goals.
    ```

    - u/xamueljones:
      ```
      Ooo! How much of the series have you already finished? I would love to see or buy whatever you already have written if you have something like that rationally abused.
      ```

  The range of superpowers is *really, really* broad. My best advice would be to go pick up a copy of *Mutants & Masterminds* and go look through their powers section (or just find a PDF online, which is less ethical but far cheaper), or the ["Stock Superpowers"](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockSuperpowers) trope page. You need to answer a few questions:

  * How much are the powers balanced against each other? Do some people have strictly better powers than other people, like someone who can create portals but only in doorways, and someone else who can create portals without the doorway?
  * Do some people just get the shaft with their power, like the Jokers from *Wild Cards* or the Case 34s from *Worm*?
  * Do you have anything like the Manton effect preventing radical offensive maneuvers? (*ex. Creating a portal inside someone's head, using telekinesis to squeeze someone's heart, etc.*)
  * Are powers "unique"? Are there dozens of people with the same flight power, or are all the ways of flying different from each other?
  * How many (if any) drawbacks do these powers have?

  Anyway, there are a lot of questions that you need to answer *before* you start thinking about what kinds of powers are appropriate to dish out. Here are my personal favorite powers:

  * Multiplication. The ability to make independent copies of yourself that can go out and live their own lives before being reabsorbed, but with no other special powers. Like Multiple Man from Marvel or Dupli-Kate and Multi-Paul from Invincible.
  * Teleportation. Usually with limits, because otherwise it's overpowered - either a refactory period, a distance limitation, or something else. Maybe you can't teleport clothing/glasses/teethfillings with you.
  * Precognition. Either a static future, or a future that shifts around a lot and represents a "best guess" made by the power.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Wow, thank you for the awesome reply!
    This will be very helpful.
    Coming up with good limitations for precognition power that don't break the story will be very interesting....
    ```

    - u/alexanderwales:
      ```
      If you want some ideas for limits to place on a precog:

      * Location limited: the power only looks at the future where the precog is currently located - put them in a cell, and they'll only be able to see the cell's future. Maybe they can only see the future of Times Square, or the future of some arbitrary spot on the planet, or something like that.
      * Distance limited: the power only works up to an hour (or two hours, or three minutes, or whatever) in the future - the precog can't see beyond that.
      * Access limited: the power can only be used for a limited amount of time per day, or with some amount of accumulated strain.
      * Fixed point: the power looks *exactly* one hour (one day, one year, etc.) into the future - if you want to bet on a horse race, you have to be watching that race an hour before it happens, and anything you miss stays missed.
      ```

      - u/CapnJones:
        ```
        Even then it'll be tough, having a friend hold up a piece of paper with relevant information on it while standing in a specific location an hour from now gives many of the same benefits as Time Turners.
        ```

  - u/6340:
    ```
    Always good to keep in mind that "better" powers is highly subjective. Being able to transform into a giant dragon may not be strictly better than controlling bugs, all dependent on the way that each power is used. In the end, it's the limitation of the power rather than the actual power itself that is key.
    ```

    - u/alexanderwales:
      ```
      "Better" is subjective, but "strictly better" (usually, depending on semantics) isn't. "Strictly better" is like the choice between paying $1.99 for a can of Mountain Dew and paying $1.09. It's the choice between capping out at a flat sprint of 60mph and 100mph. It's being able to call a coin flip correctly, and being able to call it correctly but then suffering debilitating headaches afterwards.

      I would argue that this distinction is a really big one between superhero universes, since it offers a lot of differences in what stories present themselves.
      ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      This is a comprehension error. /u/alexanderwales meant "better" in the sense of "my super strength lets me lift 1 ton, yours lets you lift 5 tons, with no drawbacks." Linearly better in a purely numerical way. Not better in a subjective, more-suited-for-certain-tasks way.
      ```

  Some friends of mine played a Champions game at one point. Among the characters:

  **Triangle Man**, the enormously strong telekinetic who could only control things shaped like triangles. 

  **White Hole Man**. He had a backpack. At any time he could pull anything out of that backpack that he might plausibly have put in it without anyone else seeing. So, he spends a few minutes wandering through a hardware store unobserved. He can now pull out an infinite amount of screws, bolts, duct tape, circular saw blades, rope, etc. He CANNOT pull out a laser cannon. If anyone looks in the backpack its contents are locked to whatever that person sees (which is generally "it's empty") until WHM has a chance to plausibly reload.

  The ability to change the colour of things (or parts of things).

  Colour the air to create 3D phantom imagery or perfect smokescreens. Blind your opponents, tattoo those you hate, and improve several fields of science by improving lenses, tagging molecules in vivo, capturing quantum dots more easily, creating the perfect solar panel (materials), etc.. I'm sure there are more options if you keep thinking.

  One very original power I found interesting was one of Leviathan's powers in the Worm universe. Whenever you move, the space you previously occupied fills with water. This... creates a lot of water. It would be extremely impractical much of the time, but it could have creative applications. From just flooding the battlefield as time goes on (Leviathan is pretty big) to creating a large reservoir of water at high altitudes to lots of cool stuff.
  ```

  - u/eaglejarl:
    ```
    Thoughts on this:

    * Is the water created or transported?
    * What temperature is it?
    * What happens if you move while you're underwater? (e.g. in a swimming pool)
    * What is the initial velocity of the water? In what reference frame?
    * How much do you have to move to make the water appear? Take a step? Sway slightly? Blink?
    * Will it appear when only a part of you moves? If you stay perfectly still and flick your finger, does it create a water whip?
    ```

    - u/Rhamni:
      ```
      In Leviathan's case:

      Presumed created. It's a superhero universe, thermodynamics be damned.

      I think it's cold liquid water. I'll *guess* it's four degrees centigrade, but not sure.

      Not made clear in the story.

      It's moving with the same momentum as Leviathan, ie if L stops the water splashes into it from behind, but does no damage because L is a great big monster with super durability.

      Any movement at all (relative to Earth, but probably ignoring the movement of tectonic plates, etc). Blinking would set it off. Leviathan is constantly wet.

      Yes.

        My post was actually more along the lines of "here are some things for the OP to consider for their story" instead of a request for information about Worm. Thank you for the response, though.
        ```

  - u/wegengottdam:

    I'm starting to work on a novel, with three different cultures all based around using one of the states of water for related magical effects.  I was thinking about having that as one of the things the water people can do, except that the force from it appearing affects them, pushing them forward.  And since if you're going faster, you have to have more water coming out in order to occupy the space you've been, you could use it to accelerate, and basically fly. 

     I think I would probably also add the ability to choose where the water comes out from, though the total amount of pressure you have to work with would be based on how fast you're going,  so for instance you could choose to channel the pressure out of your hands, or feet.  This would also allow you to make short range laser beams, if going fast enough,  by say pushing it out the very tip of your finger and making a hydraulic cutter, though the recoil might fuck you up. 

    The main problem with using it is that I'm not really sure what do with all the excess water that it would create.  Worm got around it by having it be an infrequent thing, but if there was a whole society that could do it, you would run into meteorological problems pretty quickly.  Maybe make the water disappear after a bit? Also might be a bit op,  though I think that if I made it so you could only start it at a certain minimum speed would help balance it.
    ```

    - u/Rhamni:
      ```
      Some speed or time limitation/ability to turn it off would probably help, so their whole society doesn't have to be waterproof.

      Any idea what the ice culture will get to do?
      ```

      - u/wegengottdam:
        ```
        Oh yes.  I think I'll have two things each culture can do, with perhaps enhanced senses based on the amount of water in the air for the additional water thing.   I think you would have to be going pretty fast for it to turn on, like top level human sprinting, and also have water somewhere in contact with your body.  All their warriors would have to be really good sprinters, or at least have somewhere high to jump off from 

        For ice, the two abilities would be personal stasis and being able to turn ice chunks into memory storage and combat simulaters.  The stasis would be straightforward, touch a piece of ice, and make parts or all of you utterly immovable, except by gravity. The consumed ice would turn into water vapor, with longer periods of stasis requiring bigger pieces of ice. 

        The iceputers would be a bit more complicated, but basically, when one them touched a piece of ice, they could load a memory into it, turning it all silvery and making it incapable of changing temperature. A bigger piece of ice would require a longer memory, and you can't pull memories back out.  Once activated, the user can send their mind inside it and view any memories.  Once inside, time doesn't pass outside, giving you time to think, find any relevant information, and also look outside through the block to plan what you're going to do.  When you spend time inside it, the ice slowly subliminates, giving you a limit on how much time you can spend there, as well as making it so memories have to be relearned if you want to transfer them to a new piece of ice.  So, in the middle of a fight, if someone was punching you, you could go into a piece of ice that's touching your skin somewhere, figure out the best way to block the punch, and then go back into real time and continue. 

         I wanted to try to make it a rationalesque story, so the protagonist would be ice, since the powers seem the weakest but have a lot of potential for cleverness.

    ```
    Some highlights from the worm powerbase:

    -Become better at something by stealing memories from others

    -Affect emotions

    -Perceive the world as mathematics

    -Share powers in a group

    -Super observation and induction

    -Bio-manipulation

    -adaptive regeneration

    -fine tuned telekinesis in a limited area

    -*tinkers*

    -transfer damage taken to anyone touched that day

    -accelerate entropy

  ```
  The other side to BST is "pruning".

  For example, is it a problem that portals can just casually generate infinite energy, with no effort?

  Given laws of momentum, how does superspeed work without automatically granting super-strength and vice versa, at least to *some* extent?

  You know, constructing superpowers that are well defined, don't utterly break the universe. It's not strictly necessary to do this but I like to.

  Creation and control of obsidian is a more niche one, but allows some fun options.
  ```

  - u/notentirelyrandom:
    ```
    Why obsidian? I mean, I don't disagree, "control of a thing" is incredibly powerful even without creation, but why that thing in particular?

      Monomolecular blades and reflects/refracts light.

- u/Farmerbob1:
  ```
  Powers of limited creation are always interesting.  Say, something like Green Lantern, except perhaps on a smaller scale.  The utility of the power is defined more by the user than by the power.
  ```

  - u/blazinghand:
    ```
    Green Lantern's ability (create objects, forces, and energy by thinking about it, imitate or use technology like FTL travel, transmutation, and matter conjuration) is hideously overpowered so you'd definitely need to scale it down. The basic limiting factor for Green Lantern seems to be what the character is capable of thinking of. A sufficiently ambitious Lantern would be pretty scary.

    - u/ulyssessword:
      ```
      I'd recommend [With This Ring](http://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-story-only.272850/) to anyone who wants to see a full powered Lantern.  The main character gets an Orange power ring instead of Green (powered by avarice instead of willpower), but the rest is pretty much the same.
      ```

- u/Traiden04:
  ```
  I would also recommend looking over at TV tropes section Heart is an Awesome power. It has several examples you can draw inspiration from.
  ```

- u/clawclawbite:
  ```
  Generally, if you want powers to abuse, take the power and roll it back to specific phenomina.

  Runs fast can be super strong legs, space warping, personal time acceleration, or Rollerblades and a jetpack. All have different spinoff effects.
