  Oompa Loompas.... *subverted!*

  My only regret is that I'll never get to read the Oompa Loompa song about vaping.

  This was an incredibly Dahlian chapter. The stair gag alone, just. *chef kiss*

  God, JUROR's gonna be so ruined by medical debt.

  I'd like to note that from a meta perspective, contrary to Chili's accusation, JUROR's tour of the chocolate factory actually was ended early for the purposes of

  You know, I though this fic was kind of moving away from the spirit of the original story, with all the violence and the dark humor...

  And then I watched the 70s movies, and yeesh. I mean, it's kind of zany, but it still has scenes like Wonka making fun of a woman while she watches her son drown in a river of chocolate, and the Oompa Loompas sing about how he deserves it because he's so fat. Ouch.

  Also that one scene where a cop tells a woman the terrorists will only release her husband if she gives them her stash of WonkaBars and she goes "... Shit. I need to think about this."

    I really like how this story dials up the insanity just enough to really highlight it. Like, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory was *insane*, but we somehow rolled with it because Gene Wilder seems so amiable. The fat kid getting sucked up the chocolate pipes legit gave me nightmares as a kid. Honestly though, Wonka was a sociopath and Bucket is only just enough more blatant that it makes us actually question it.

  I have a feeling Mahuika's next line is going to be something like "I vape. Also, dude, my family has been bribing me with with vapes since I was 8. I know when I'm being baited."
  ```

  - u/gryfft:
    ```
    Yeah, her thing is she only talks about vaping, so it makes sense that in the vaping room she'll speak at length in complete sentences about the intricacies of the hobby. This is her one chance to say some hilariously insightful things because they're tangentially related to vaping and for once it'll be in a context where that's not just an annoying interruption.

  Did the author just get rid of JUROR because he was universally agreed on being the best child?...I'm gonna do my boy Chili a solid favor and thus announce Keerthi as the new best child!
  ```

  - u/havoc_mayhem:
    ```
    It's the same (so far) as in the original book - the kids are eliminated in the order they found tickets.

      You found a pattern? Maybe we can predict what the Author
      ```

    - u/CouteauBleu:
      ```
      That would imply Mahuika is next, since she got the second ticket. I hope the author breaks the pattern here, because it would be kind of obvious (and it would be a retread of Violette Beauregard).
      ```

- u/WalterTFD:
  ```
  *"Good question," said Mr. Bucket, "Children, if you are out in public and you wish to find stairs, what should you do?"*

  *"Look for a sign?" asked Keerthi.*

  *"Vape?" asked Mahuika.*

  Man, how does that keep being so funny?  The Mahuika joke gets me every single time.

  > "No you don't," said Chili. "Truncatism is pointless but you don't even do it. Not really. You only stop sentences and unimportant actions nobody cares about. You would never stop breathing. You would never stop blinking. You would never stop anything in a way that makes life harder for you or people you care about. You are an idiot who tricked bigger idiots into thinking you are deep. You are lazy and worthless and no one will ever love you." "You don't know what you're talking about," said JUROR. "So quit the contest!" said Chili. "That would be honest. But you won't because you want to win a chocolate factory. If you ended it before you could win that would show that you were a real artist instead of a faker." "I am an artist," said JUROR. "What I do is art." "Bad art," said Chili. JUROR said nothing.

  What if all the things that JUROR doesn't say or do are actually

    I actually unironically like Truncatism after being able to soak in this for a few days.

  This chapter was absolutely incredible, and certainly my favorite of the series thus far. The puns were incredible, and the wordplay was even better.

  I really liked juror, and I'm very sad to see him go. That being said, I couldn't imagine a more dark yet hilarious way to see it happen.

  Thank you for the incredible series, and I can't wait for more!

  But seriously I keep jumping between annoyed and impressed. It's deliberately irritating and yet

  Finally picked this up and this story is perfect and just as insane as it needs to be.

  It's like that line from hitchhikers guide to the galaxy: "There is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers exactly what the Universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarre and inexplicable." But instead of the universe it's the original chocolate factory story.

  Also, I'm still dying from Don Quixote being described as "a scathing 17th century diatribe against the viability of wind power."
