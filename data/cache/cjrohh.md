Thanks for reading!

  I enjoyed the arguing in this chapter. You can tell that Ram's parents aren't just country bumpkins and clearly realize that there is probably more going on than meets the eye. At the same time, nobody really know what that might be and the confusion threatening inaction comes through in the fruitless back and forth of the bickering.

  I'm really curious to see how this all plays out now.

  I can't wait to read this, the previous chapters have been really good!

  Edit: Wow, bit of a crazy twist here. Interested to see what happens between Darun and Ram

  Just found this, what's the pitch, how good is it, how "I just read Worm and I want to write something like it"-ish is it?

    Not at all like Worm. World is pretty unique; it seems to actually be two worlds that super-impose on each other with disastrous results every 4 days. Reasonably good so far; I binged it when 6.4 came out and certainly don't feel that I wasted my time. Lots of potential there, but the chapters/arcs are pretty short (took me about 3 hours to binge everything that is out so far) and that potential is still a promise to be realized. I'd at least recommend keeping an eye on it.

      Crap, looks like it might be good. The about page sounds cool too. Ugh, I'm going to have to read it and get emotionally invested and shit.

        So far nobody has been quite well enough written for me to get emotionally invested into. I don't mean that as a slight to the story; it is worth the read so far.
