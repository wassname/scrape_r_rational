  Giving the drug to a thousand people, because you think you can determine who deserves to live and who deserves to die? permaTruth is thinking along the right lines, but he overestimates his own intelligence.

  Give the drug out for free to everybody? Better, but that would start the mother of all wars. Last chance to assassinate your enemies, everybody! Better hurry up and nuke Pyongyang, it won't work this time next week!

  So, make everybody immortal, at the same time, in secret with no warning. Oh, and as quickly as possible. I think that would be my wish.

    Gotta agree. He wasn't even specific enough for it to be worth it. He didn't make himself smarter, or make it easier to gain information. He chose to only create enough Elixir of Life to serve a small population, ensuring most of humanity will miss out. All in all, it is a huge wasted opportunity that - at *best* - creates a real Illuminati or ra!Wheel Group.

  This just seems too broken to be particularly interesting. Ascending to godhood, becoming omnipotent, or anything like that are guaranteed to work, and render anything else useless
  ```

    ```
    Well... how exactly would you go about trying to become omnipotent?  

    This is a distinct power to the *Path to Victory*, because it just makes your attempt work - it doesn't allow for any kind of feedback or give you any help in planning how to go about it.  It also doesn't help you select a worthwhile goal...

      I'd become omnipotent by saying that I am now omnipotent. It has to work.

  Is there a no-Munchkining rule in effect that says I can't just design an FAI with 0% chance of failure?
  ```

    ```
    Skip the FAI middleman, just make everything be perfect forever.

  Thought it was interesting enough for this subreddit. Not the random person testing so much as dedicating your life to scientific research
  ```

- u/None:
  ```
  Nitpick: it's generally "fool proof". Though considering the person you linked is talking about creating a beverage, "full proof" would indicate its alcohol content is 100%.
