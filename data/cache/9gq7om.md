  ```
  I still think harmony stirred something that caused this... Because they're going to rip these guys apart... And thinking about it, they would have if they succeeded in killing whisper too... She gets rid of these guys and her opposition about the torture things

  ... I really hope they don't request delphic's footage of the death though, I doubt he can find security cameras in there for it... Not if they do shady stuff in there...

    I think her nickname of Harm also alludes to this conclusion.

    Maybe not explicit planning, but her overall impact on the health of the group and potentially a turncape scene.
