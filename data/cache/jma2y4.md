## Rational Mass Effect Andromeda Fanfic

### Post:

So does anyone know of any rational Mass Effect Andromeda fanfics where

* the Intiative is actually smarter and anticipates that there might hostiles in Heleus,
* where Addison gets sacked and arrested for incompetence, and supporting the Three Sabers
* where Sloane is given a less sympathetic backstory during the Nexus uprising
* where Cora has a more traumatic backstory instead of just some whining about not fitting in.
* where the Angara have already driven the Kett off of Eos's and acquired the Remnant Drive Core on Elaaden so as to avoid some of the colonialist implications
* where Vetra's side quest involves taking down the Three Sabers and Addison

  All I recall is visiting the planet and going "Uh...you guys couldn't even do this much?"

  \+1 to number of colonies established

  That's a mighty specific request for a relatively niche fandom.

  i honestly find the idea of this incredibly amusing because..... if you apply any rationality at all to the setting there's only one choice the initiative could make.

   with one piece of technology (the tech that allows the initiative ships to dump their accumulated charge mid jump) they've allowed for literally unlimited FTL and sublight travel and completely changed the face of the milky way galaxy.

  warp capable defense stations are now common place, every initiative shareholder is wealthy enough to buy entire star systems, the reapers get curb-stomped brutally the moment they arrive on the scene, and the entire population of the milky way doesn't even need cryopods to travel out of system due to the ability to just.....fire ships out of mass relays at distant galaxies and have them arrive in years as opposed to the 600 years that the initiative took to arrive at their destination.
