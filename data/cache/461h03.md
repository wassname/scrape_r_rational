## [D] Who is Wertifloke?

### Post:

This was originally a post that attempted to figure out the identity of Wertifloke, the author of [The Waves Arisen](https://wertifloke.wordpress.com/about/).

I've decided to take down this post, since when I wrote this I had recalled that Wertifloke was encouraging others to deduce their identity. Looking now, however, I can't find anything, so I'm clearing the post.

I had no real conclusion from this research, so you're not really missing anything by having it taken down.

    To be fair, Eliezer keeps going on about how if he was to *hypothetically* write something under another name, he would deny all knowledge of it, and requesting that anyone asked if they're him refuse to confirm or deny it to keep it going for longer.

      It seems to me that the purpose of this was to obscure the identity of author of *Girl Corrupted by Internet*; but Eliezer decided against it, for some reason, and published it under his actual name.

      (or it could be that the *real* author of *Girl Corrupted by Internet* isn't Eliezer, and his taking credit for it was a part of some plot; if it so, I have no idea what this plot could possibly be)

        He first talked about writing anonymously waaay before he wrote that.  I believe it was shortly after Methods ended.

          From note to chapter 119:

          >The final thing that would be natural for me to try would be writing something that is even lower-status than Harry Potter fanfiction, like say erotic romance, so that my brain will stop trying to Take It Seriously. (I don’t think this actually comes with a penalty to writing quality; it didn’t for the first 50 chapters of HPMOR.) Sub-obstacle #1 to this is that I worry I might have actually learned the true lesson that there is no such thing as a nonserious genre. But the larger problem with this particular tactic is that…

          > Obstacle #2 to my writing more fiction is that my writing so far has had negative, as well as positive, consequences for public relations.  My writing tends to be controversial and stomp all over certain sorts of minefields. Worse, there is some quality of it that seems to attract a certain sort of Sneer mindset – not just social-media sneertrolls, but the seething pools of corruption that are mainstream journalists. (I have theories of exactly what is happening, but it’s not worth going into here.) This has costs for the projects I’m currently associated with in the public eye. I don’t think I can write ‘safely’ without both destroying the integrity of my fiction and also destroying the satisfaction that I receive from it. A sense of joy in writing does not go along with constantly looking over your shoulder.


          "writing something that is even lower-status than Harry Potter fanfiction, like say erotic romance". This quote describes his last work well, doesn't it?

      I once asked Eliezer on reddit if he wrote The Waves Arisen. He told me that he could neither confirm nor deny it. So I doubt we're going to get any information from that direction.

      Edit: I have also been unable to reach Wertifloke on their wordpress website, nor through any other means. It is a shame, because if they have any other stories I would like to read them.

  Hmmm, I have made personal copies of *Waves Arisen* in epub and mobi formats when I thought the website was only going to be up for a short while. (I never made any pdfs, because the font size tends to be off or some similar issue)

  Would people be interested in me distributing these copies? Is this an ethical thing to do when I cannot get in contact with /u/Wertifloke to ask if s/he would be okay with this?

  EDIT: Alright! Anyone who wants a personal copy of *The Waves Arisen*, PM me.

  Also, I've successfully made a proper-looking pdf version after trying it again today.

    Considering he made it (and still has it) available for free online, I doubt it would be a problem for you to do that. You aren't handing out paid content or anything, you're merely making things more convenient. As long as you don't charge people anything, I can't see the author being mad.
    ```

- u/awesomeideas:
  ```
  We should all pick a few of the worst — but still good — fanfictions that could conceivably be written by Yudkowsky, and consistently say they're written by him. Progressively choose fiction of lower and lower quality, until he's forced to tell us which is actually his!


  Note: Do not actually do this. I think it might be libelous.

  >This analysis appears to show that none of those surveyed is the writer of The Waves Arisen, and if they are, they went to a great deal of effort to hide their similarities.

  This program doesn't seem to reliably group authors whose identities we know together, so I'm not sure how much credence we can give to it's pronouncement that Wertifloke's style doesn't correlate with anyone else's.
  ```

- u/gabbalis:
  ```
  There's also the possibility that it's some unknown novel author that doesn't want their name associated with fanfiction. Though it would be nice to narrow the scope of this theory before analyzing every novel whose author was alive when it was published.

  > A few minor details, such as the different between "chūnin" (the style used in A Drop of Poison) and "chuunin" (the style used in The Waves Arisen), point to their difference as well.

  This has very little weight. If I had written a Naruto fanfic, and I wanted to write a new one that couldn't be traced back to me, this is exactly the sort of cheap details I would change.

  (Then again, if I had written a Naruto rationalfic, and I wanted to write a new rationalfic that couldn't be traced back to me, I probably wouldn't use the Naruto setting at all.)
  ```

- u/XxChronOblivionxX:
  ```
  Hmm, there are some things that make this less likely.

  I am positive I've seen Eliezer refuse to confirm or deny that he is Wertifloke after someone asks him.  I also remember the facebook post where he talks about anonymously writing things, and asks everyone to never confirm or deny their identities if asked.

  Eliezer did comment and praise "Waves Arisen" for its originality in one of the earlier chapters, which would be a bit weird, but something I definitely wouldn't put past him.

  Also, Wertifloke, when he first released the first chapter here, said that he intended to finish it all before Methods started its final arc.  I would think it a bit strange that Eliezer would spend three weeks writing a complete story when, from his own account, he wasn't even finished compiling the final versions of the Methods chapters.  I recall that some of the chapters were fully put together not very long before they were uploaded.

  Alas, this is at least plausible.  Eliezer has read a lot of Naruto fanfiction, so I wouldn't be that surprised if this ends up being him.

    That doesn't seem like it makes this less likely. Indeed, it seems precisely calculated to make this neither more nor less likely.

  Off-topic: An hour ago I was wondering this exact thing; similar phenomena have occurred when thinking of contacting a friend, and within fifteen minutes they contact me.  Is this the same phenomena that occurred when Newton and Leibniz both independently conceived and formulated the calculus?  How does one go about investigating its cause?

  Best guess is like thoughts occur all the time, but only when presented with evidence of an agent, uninfluenced by ourselves, thinking the same thought at or near the same time do we notice and give weight to the occurrence.  This doesn't explain the calculus issue, an explanation for which I've heard posits that the confluence of the sum of an era's knowledge in the minds of experts can lead to identical insights if the base of knowledge is the same.

  Thoughts?

  - u/Revisional_Sin:

    You forget all the times coincidences don't happen. Unless you have empirical evidence, you should favour this bias as an explanation over supernatural influence.

    Leibniz and Newton is almost certainly due to the "adjacent possible".

    It's likely to be a coincidence, because throughout an individual's lifespan they will have millions and millions of thoughts. Therefore, events with a one-to-million odds for occurring at a similar time period as to when you will have a thought about the event occurring are likely to happen over and over given billions of chances. In addition, you and your friends have similar routines due to living in the same time zone, so the both of you were bound to call at the same time sooner or later (in fact if your friend tends to always call around 5:00 PM, you are likely to be thinking of him/her right before the call).

    It's hard to say how unlikely it was for Newton and Leibniz to come up with the same idea because we don't know about all of the other people who could have come up with the same idea given a few more months to years. Hence this probably looks more improbable than it really is.

    TL;DR - It's not as unlikely as you'd think and even if it was, there are so many chances for it to occur that it has to happen sooner or later.

  I think it's unlikely that Eliezer would write a rationality story and then not take credit for it. Actually I can't think of a good reason why any established rationality author would post a rationality story under a different name.

  - u/alexanderwales:

    I can answer the questions about reasons why you'd do it, since I've done it.

    Pseudonyms are good for works of a different nature or with less time invested, to counter expectations (real or imagined), to post something untoward, or to avoid prejudice/favoritism during the weekly challenge (which I couldn't otherwise participate in since I run it). Plus if you post something under a pseudonym you know that any attention or appreciation it gets is real and honest, based solely on the work itself rather than accrued credit.

    (That said, I didn't write *The Waves Arisen*.)

      I think I remember that Waves Arisen was written as an exercise in writing quickly - a chapter a day, I think?

  - u/EliezerYudkowsky:
    ```
    I can't confirm or deny *Waves Arisen* but will confirm online stories with rational elements that I have either written or cowritten which do not have my name on them.

    (Ordinarily an important part of a secret is the fact that the secret exists, but in this case, the secret of the secret's existence seems less important than this chance to be gratuitously evil.)

      * You mentioned in a (public) Facebook thread that *Time Braid* was your first exposure to Naruto. Presumably you were exposed to *Time Braid* through /r/rational.

      * *Time Braid* was [first submitted](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/28n846/rt_naruto_time_braid_groundhog_day_fanfiction/) to /r/rational around 1.5 years ago, in June 2014.

      * *The Waves Arisen* was posted all at once (or close to it) right before your hiatus on *HPMoR* ended—around the end of January 2015. I would guess that this implies that the work was written on some varying timescale before then and queued for publication (rather than the assumption everyone else seems to be making: that the author can just type very fast.)

      That gives you a decent window to read *Time Braid*, read up (and maybe watch) *Naruto*, decide to write something, pick the "genre" of rational *Naruto* fic, plot it out, write it, and set it up as a "treat" to presage *HPMoR*'s return.

      It also gives you a pretty good motive—to write something serving as all of:

      * a *break* from the stress of *HPMoR*, which everyone had very high expectations for.

      * as *practice* for a complete story—important for someone who knew that they hadn't had much practice writing endings, especially satisfying munchkin-shaped endings.

      * as a *NaNoWriMo* novel. Although you've never (to my knowledge) personally mentioned participating in NaNoWriMo, your wife does, and likely was in November 2014 ...though I'm not sure how well you knew one-another at that point in time? Anyway, I would also say that, when outlined, *The Waves Arisen* fits well as the kind of short story that results from a single month-long writing sprint, with a good bit of editing and polish done later.

      * as, perhaps, a *fun social interaction* with someone you wouldn't ordinarily get to collaborate with.

      Actually, taking that last point further: I don't think anyone was considering that the work might have been cowritten until you mentioned the possibility, just now. Cowriting would, of course, thwart stylometric analysis. It would also make your easy assumption of outside view on the work—complimenting its originality and so forth—more "human"; you'd be complimenting your co-author's contributions.

      ...*and* it would make your above comment into one of those infuriating literal statements—it would make perfect sense that you *cannot* confirm *or* deny you are the author of *The Waves Arisen*, if it is not true that you are "the author", and also not true that you are not "the author", because you are one of multiple authors.

        There's a section of HPMOR, it might have been during the Self-Actualization arc, where Harry talks about applying the reasoning of "I can neither confirm nor deny" seemingly at random, so that people can't deduce from your usage of it your true meaning.

        The fact that he's discussed this before means you can take absolutely nothing from his usage of that phrase, because the chances are high he applies it in exactly the same way.

    He literally did that with HPMOR until months after he first started publishing it. Kinda, anyway. Read [this set of posts](http://lesswrong.com/lw/20w/open_thread_april_2010/1uf9) on that popped up on LW as late as April 2010.

    >Lesswrong is writing a story, called "Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality". It's just about what you'd expect; absolutely full of ideas from LW.com. I know it's not the usual fare for this site, but I'm sure a lot of you have enjoyed Eliezer's fiction as fiction; you'll probably like this as well.

    >Who knows, maybe the author will even decide to decloak and tell us who to thank?

    Alicorn:

    >I'm 98% confident it's Eliezer. He's been taunting us about a piece of fanfiction under a different name on fanfiction.net for some time. I guess this means I don't have to bribe him with mashed potatoes to get the URL after all.

  I don't think it's Eliezer, the style is pretty different to anything Eliezer has ever written, at least I think so. 

  I don't think it's unusual to create new identities for individual projects either. I've done it before, I don't think it's particularly weird, and I would predict Wertifloke to be perhaps more likely to be no-one significant in particular, as opposed to someone well-known under a different name in the world of fiction, rational or otherwise.

  I just read the first several chapters of The Wave Arisen, and I have to say, there's almost too much thematic overlap with Yudkowsky's writing for it to have *not* been written by him. The focus on the prisoner's dilema; authority figures "following a script"; the oblique references to Worm characters; the emphasis on real world consequences to bad decisions, the list goes on and on. 

  Edit: Just finished a few more chapters and I'm now basically certain this is either written or co-written by Yudkowski. The interlude in chapter 11 is just way too similar to other writing by Yudkowski, not to mention how the author quotes Yudkowski writing (Final Words). It is *exactly* like a test draft of the thematic structure of the last chapter of HPMOR -- only written before HPMOR was finished! Barring strong evidence to the contrary, I'm concluding that Yudkowski wrote some or all of this.
