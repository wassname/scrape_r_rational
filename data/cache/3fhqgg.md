  Kurama continues to be a lying liar who lies, and Orochimaru is a team 8 polyshipper (apparently).

  Bahaha, I love your Shino. He's turned his bugs into routers, lord knows where they keep the routing tables, what their frame format is, or what their addressing scheme is. Not to mention mesh networking is *hard*. 

  Have the Aburame invented some analogue of general purpose computing yet? Their bugs seems more than capable of it.

    Kikai Neural networks!  Other ninj-puters include the Naruto Beowulf cluster, i/o compression via Sharingan genjutsu, the Universal Sarutobi Bojutsu standard, Konan's Microservices, and `rm -rf /*` with Danzo.

    Honestly, there's a crack Tron crossover waiting to happen...

      Can you imagine a Beowulf cluster of Slashdots?

  Hah, so Kurama was tricking Naruto earlier! Although he didn't have ill intent, which was a bit of a surprise. I'm pretty curious what his imprisonment within Kushina was like, and whether he got staked-in-his-everything as per canon...

  The discussion on sexuality was interesting, and something I haven't found touched upon in stories much. People seem to avoid discussing anything related to the topic, from various bodily functions like peeing, pooping and monthly periods in the case of girls to...well, what you covered here, relationships beyond the binary one-guy one-girl partnership. As to why Orochimaru asked Shino to ask Anko about this, though...I admit I have no clue.

  Naruto's bumbling attempts at romance are sweet, especially when he puts his foot in it and admits he's mainly doing this because Kurama said so. I wonder what the other tailed beast hosts are like here? Do they get along with their prisoners?

    It actually felt...a touch out of place? Like, all the rest of the big expositions and what not have felt directly related to this naruto setting, where as this poly discussion seemed more like...a lecture on poly to the readers.

      It felt alot like reading HPMoR again.

    The sexuality speech actually went in one ear and out the other with me

     It's almost exactly my spiel when people ask me about being polyamorous, albeit with fewer engineering metaphors involving chaotic instability and fixed points. It's far from abnormal for me, so I sometimes forget that that's not true for others. 

    My initial expectation, especially given that it's to Shino is to cause him to want or expect a polyamorous relationship with Hinata, and muck up the dynamic of the team. However Shino seems like both the only viable candidate for such a tactic, and one of the least likely to fall for it. He's more than reasonable enough to realize that being able to fall in love with multiple people (like most do) means that fixating on one person who doesn't reciprocate is a easy route to unhappiness. 

    Of course, Orochimaru is probably of the "one level higher than you" archetype.  

    > I wonder what the other tailed beast hosts are like here? Do they get along with their prisoners?

    In canon, doesn't Killer B get along with his biiju?

    Rather, he *claims* not to have had ill intent - and that after Shino pointed out the earlier lie.  I *do not trust Powers!*  Especially those known for their embodiment of malice...

    View the conversation as a Checkoff's gun, apply it to the only possible subjects of future need, and then extrapolate a motive.

  I'm having so much trouble trusting Kurama, even though what he's saying makes rational sense. T_T
