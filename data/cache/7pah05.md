  It upsets me a bit that Harry didn't take chronomancy despite the obvious usefulness to his current circumstances. 

  It's not like a year 1 defense class will help him against his future self, and he has another five main subjects in common with his friends, so the excuse is a bit odd.

  I lost it a chronomancy starting from - 1, simply amazing
  ```

  I would quite like to take a course on "Placebomancy". Thats proper magic.

    Of course it isn't!  *That's the whole point.*

    EDIT: Something something, UNSONG.

    That one word convinced me I should read this.

  I really, really, REALLY want to read this fic, but just can't get over the fact that its.. Horry Patter. Just looking at words like 'Philologer' makes my soul hurt :(

  But I still really want to read it, because if it's half as  interesting as the comments make it sound then it must be amazing.

    What's wrong with *philologer*?

      ```
      Yeah, that's a real thing, someone who studies language in oral or written historical sources.
      ```

  - u/Marthinwurer:
    ```
    Oh, it's totally worth it. You get used to it after a few chapters because it becomes regular.
    ```

  I'm just disappointed that chronomancy classes are arranged in order from smallest to largest.  I was kind of hoping for a joke similar to when Zaphod Beeblebrox attempted to summon his great-grandfather at a seance.  

  > Zaphod:	Concentrate on his name.  
  Arthur:	What is it?  
  Zaphod:	Zaphod Beeblebrox the Fourth.  
  Arthur:	What?  
  Zaphod:	Zaphod Beeblebrox the Fourth. Concentrate!  
  Arthur:	The Fourth?  
  Zaphod:	Yeah. Listen, I'm Zaphod Beeblebrox, my father was Zaphod Beeblebrox the Second, my grandfather Zaphod Beeblebrox the Third...  
  Arthur:	What?  
  Zaphod:	There was an accident with a contraceptive and a time machine. Now concentrate!
  ```

  - u/OutOfNiceUsernames:

    Yeah, reading that part as

    >CHRONOMANCY 1

    >CHRONOMANCY 0*

    made me laugh at the joke, but then after reaching the “CHRONOMANCY 1*” part I had to go re-read it properly as 


    >CHRONOMANCY -1

    >CHRONOMANCY 0*

    which made me somewhat disappointed by the actual thing.
