## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  (Posting in the Wednesday Thread on a Friday, because I'm an absolute madman)

  Inspired by the next biweekly challenge and my previous struggles with making DnD Gods rational, I had an idea which I like, but don't really have the time or confidence to write a challenge entry for, so I'm just dumping it here (holy run-on sentence Batman).


  The Gods are really magically powerful intelligences with weird utility functions. Some have wide reaching, simple, intuitive goals (destroy all life, ensure the survival of the Dwarven race, etc), while others have more localised, weirdly specific goals (Ensure no one over 6 feet tall steps foot on this island, ensure the population of this town stays between 300-350 at all times, etc). As a general rule, the more specific the God, the less powerful they are. 

  Naturally, the Gods frequently have mutually exclusive goals, but for whatever reason (I'm leading towards MAD), the Gods cannot or will not fight each other directly. Instead, they have settled on a system of making pacts with mortals, wherein a part of the God's soul is implanted in the mortal's, granting them a fraction of the God's power, but also converting them to the God's ideals. While the mortal retains all their memories and pre-existing goals and desires, carrying out their God's mission becomes an unignorable moral imperative, which they truly believe in, even if they can't quite communicate its importance to non-converts. These people are Clerics and Paladins.

  The stronger a God is, the more people they can make a pact with, eg, the aforementioned God of Dwarves would have thousands of Clerics, while the God of the Island of People Who Are Not Tall would have maybe a dozen at most. A pact cannot be made without explicit agreement from both parties, (ie, the mortal cannot be tricked into signing away their life (but can be coerced, threatened, etc), while the God cannot be forced into accepting a bunch of useless followers). Pacts can be ended, though this actually happening is rare.

  Another idea I had was that there are some Gods who are so tiny and specific (ensure this one tree is within 5 feet of a drop of water during all solar eclipses that fall on a Tuesday, unless it's a leap year), that they cannot make a pact by themselves, but can join together in large groups to make a pact with a single human, who has to try and satisfy a more diverse set of goals, with the advantage of not having to satisfy any particular one. (These would be Druids)

  Stuff I need to work out includes

  * How much are the Gods allowed to communicate with mortals (both their converts and others) Could a God be used for instant communication, or would this be considered a breach of the MAD rules? 

  * Where do Gods come from, and can they die? 

  * More consistent rules for the relationship between a God's strength and their goals (can a God become more or less powerful depending on the scope of their goal changing? Eg, if 99% of Dwarves died, protecting them would suddenly be a much smaller, more specific goal. Would this result in a loss of power for the God of Dwarves?

    Here's a possible extension on that thought.

    The gods are *ideals*. They draw their power from the number of living beings that hold to that same ideal; for example, most Dwarves are at least partially in agreement with the ideal that all Dwarves should be protected, so there's a strong Ideal that says 'protect all dwarves'. Many psychopaths are strongly in agreement with the idea that everything should be destroyed, so there's an Ideal for "destroy everything". The inhabitants of a small island might dislike outsiders, so there would be a (far weaker) Ideal for "keep outsiders off this island".

    So. Each Ideal has a driving principle, and a certain amount of power drawn from the collective latent magic of everyone who believes in that Ideal. However, for all their power, these Ideals have no *intelligence* - no ability to know how to direct or use that power. This, then, is where the Clerics and Paladins come in. They invite an Ideal to share their mind - and thus to share their intelligence, their brainpower. The intelligence of an Ideal is equal to the collective intelligence of all the clerics and/or paladins of that Ideal; and the Ideal also tends to take on other personality traits from its clerics and paladins. (Thus, for example, and Ideal for "protect all Dwarves" would get a lot of Dwarven clerics, most of which enjoy the taste of ale; therefore, the Ideal in question would soon decide that it enjoyed the taste of ale). In this way, the Ideals can begin to develop complex personalities in line with their worshippers (and these personalities would change over time). At the same time, though, a cleric's personality would slowly change to better match that of the Ideal; it's a two-way process.

    The Ideal does, however, have its own memories, which it can communicate to its paladins and clerics at will. Normally, however, it doesn't; it'll generally only communicate in order to better serve its central purpose.

    With this basis, it's clear to see that an Ideal can die, but only if no-one anywhere agrees with the idea anymore, so for popular Ideals it's virtually impossible. It also gives a reasonable relationship between the strength of the Ideal and its goals (killing 99% of Dwarves will weaken the Ideal of "protect all Dwarves", but not by anywhere near 99% as the remaining 1% of dwarves will suddenly be in much stronger agreement with the Ideal than before).
