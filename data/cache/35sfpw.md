## [MK][BST][RST] Munchkining space-manipulation magic

### Post:

I'm in the planning stages for a world where magic involves setting down runes in order to warp and otherwise manipulate space. I'm hoping that you folks could help me to see some unconventional ways of taking advantage of the system. 

If it has to do with bending space then runes can do it, but: 

* You have to actually make those runes. 

* This can be both difficult and time-consuming: bigger tasks require not only more runes, but greater precision in your runes. 

* Runes that are carved into rock will, naturally, last longer than runes that you made with water calligraphy. 

* Runes start working from the moment that the system is complete, but it is possible to turn a system of runes off by erasing the "capstone" or final rune of the system. Even if you want the system to last for centuries it might still be a good idea to just draw that last rune in pencil if you don't want it to be on for that whole time. 

A few general rules: 

* It is easier in every way to do something that is simpler, than something that is more complex (obviously). 

* It is easier to do something small, than to do something large. Doubling the internal space of your wallet is so, so much easier than doubling the internal space of a police box or tripling the internal space of your wallet. 

* When transporting things, it is again easier to send less than it is to send more, and to send things a shorter distance than it is to send them a longer distance. Because you are only transporting air, it is easier to "throw" your voice to someone a mile away than it is to throw yourself that same distance, and it is also easier than throwing your voice five miles. 

* Each function requires its own set of runes. If you are throwing your voice a mile away then your target needs a set of runes on that side to do the same to you so that you can hear a response. Either that, or you need a second set of runes to go to in order to "pull" from that location. No matter what, though, you need some coordination if you are "throwing" and "pulling" from the same patch of space, making it like a push-to-talk radio. 

* It is easier to transport something that is stationary than something that is moving. For example, you can conceivably assassinate someone from a mile away from shooting them with a bullet that you transport into someone's heart, but this is pretty hard to do. 

* Inside a warped space (like a bigger-on-the-inside house) it is possible to create a sort of hammerspace that can be accessed from anywhere. This is immensely hard to do, however, because you are effectively required to make hundreds of invisible access points that can be interacted with only from a certain position. 

* Yes, you can send your space colony to the Andromeda Galaxy in an eyeblink. But this is also very, very hard. *You need a knowledge of relative distance*: Sending someone a town that is a mile away from your location requires the same set of runes today as it will ten years from now because that town will always be a mile from your current position. If you want to go to the Moon, though, then the runes you need will change based on where the Moon is relative to your present position.

  Create a closed loop of runespace that's locked from the inside - the "pull" request to move something in or out always has to be confirmed from inside. Indestructible panic room.

  Do the opposite. Nearly unescapable prison.

  Create a corridor of stretched space extending upwards from earth in which distance is much, much less. FTL flight.

  Instead of bothering with specifics, send a spaceship in about the right place near another star. They can work out more precise coordinates.

  Compress space until you initiate nuclear fusion.

    I know that it would work out, but that conversation still strikes me as hilarious. 

    "So... you're going to drop us off at Alpha Centauri?" 

    "Well, somewhere around there, anyway. I dunno. You can figure it out when you get there. You've got engines." 

    "Wait wha--"
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      "Just aim for the light, OK? Well, unless it's *really close*. In that case, aim away from the light. Got it?"
      ```

    Does that work? Could someone else not make a rune targeted at the inside of your panic room? If you can throw your voice five miles without needing a receiving rune on the other end, what prevents you from teleporting into a closed space that you don't physically have access to?

    Similarly for the inescapable prison, if you have the materials you ought to be able to teleport yourself out. Drawing runes in your own faeces is gross, but it makes it effectively impossible to keep anyone imprisoned anywhere.

  People have to make runes? Runes can't make other runes? Can runes be created accidentally?

    People have to make runes. 

    Magic, at least as magicians understand it, is about the human will setting bounds upon and bringing order to the world of chaos that is around us. This is expressed through runes because it is through language that even non-magical humans are able to organize the unorganized world. 

    But of course that might be a load of malarkey. Some magicians think that runes are the original written language despite that almost certainly not being true. They're also not sure if this or that legend (Odin, for example) has anything to do with their traditions or is just coincidence. 

    So it is possible that they've hit upon the true metaphysical reasons for magic taking the form of runes that have to be intentionally written down, but it's also possible that they've just come up with a nice Just So story.

      Build runes in the shape of roads or a garden path, see what happens when people walk around in it.
      ```

    - u/chaosmosis:
      ```
      What counts as making a rune? Can a person use tools to make a rune, or do they have to use their hand? Because it would be easy to make a simple tool that could draw or carve several runes at once, even if machines are disallowed.
      ```

- u/None:
  ```
  How does this space warping happening? If I warp a 1m square to be 1km on a side, does that create more dirt? Is it just a coordinate transform?
  ```

  - u/callmebrotherg:
    ```
    I would say that, in general, matter is not created, but this gets blurry as you get into some truly dangerous and weird applications that rely on the fact that, in this setting's cosmology, there is an "Outside" to the universe that is made of "chaotic matter". The additional matter is coming from Outside and being converted, but it's only recently that any sane magicians have felt safe about conducting research down this path.

  ```
  Re: relative distance - how precise does this have to be?  Does orientation pay into it?

  Depending on precision, even runes carved into bedrock would degrade fairly quickly - or maybe a treehouse would work, or even a cart in the right place.
  ```

  Hmm, hmm. Can you make "standing" portals? As in, Aperture Science "standing" portals? (If you can, although most things are still possible otherwise, what do they need to be anchored to?)

  Everything is moving. There's the (optional) movement of the planets (or equivalent), but there's also the blood through your veins, the brownian motion of, well, everything... Particularly hot things. And if I make a large effect, stuff moves through it... So can you elaborate on what's known about doing this to moving things?

  Sound isn't air, it's compression. You can certainly do that by sending air, but there are other ways... What forms of energy can be sent? Do hot or cold things take different runes? What if I have runes for only a subset of the thing I'm trying to send? Say, water with ice in it, but only runes for water, or ice?

  For that matter, can you add or remove energy from things during transport? (I mean, strictly speaking, you're going to be adding potential energy - but what about thermal and/or kinetic?)

  What observations are there about the power consumption of runes? Let's say I make something that transports an apple a kilometer directly up. Is conservation of energy conserved, as far as people can tell, or am I "creating" energy? (If you're creating energy... is the world slowly heating up due to waste energy from all this?)

    In another comment I mentioned that magicians are afraid of somebody stupid finding out about magic and blowing up the world. 

    "Hey guys, did you know that you can use runes to connect to the sun!?" is *exactly* the sort of thing makes them worried. >:]

      On the plus side, build a steam engine around it and you have dirt cheap unlimited electricity. Or just a steam boat or jet engine with unlimited propulsion. Or an Orion drive spaceship (though the distance would ideally have to be adjusted every fifty million meters).

      The Earth's orbital eccentricity isn't big enough that distance is a problem, and if direction matters, the fact that runes work on a rotating planet means you could just have a device which always points the runes at the sun.

  Someone decides to experiment with a system of runes that will compress the space near it into an infinitely dense point. This ends badly, as black holes. A thought experiment could be what would happen if you teleported an object through a portal, but flipped it?

  ```
  Lets talk limitation removal

  Can you
  1) Warp space making things bigger to make it trivial to get more precise runes once you let it shrink again
  2) Warp space so that a single rune occupies multiple positions in a rune setup? Thereby allowing arrays that make other arrays more powerful.
  3) Shrink rune arrays for easily transportable abilities?
  4) Set up machines that inscribe runes?
  ```

  If you can use control runes which sense an environment and make the appropriate changes to the space-bending runes to accommodate those changes, you can do so very, very much.

  Portal to the moon? Control runes tracking the moon, or runes on the moon which measure the distance and direction to the corresponding runes on the planet.

  Indestructible infinity-tanking armor. Anything which hits the surface of the armor falls into a two-mile-wide hollow sphere where gravity is set to point away from the center. If something wants to hit the wearer, it has to pass through the armor's 'surface' and then manage to fly a mile straight 'up'. At the centerpoint there's a complex knot of space with the only opening being the size of a marble. Anything which flies directly into that marble comes out the other size because the internal space in it represents a straight tunnel with a giant loop coming off it which is where the wearer's physical self is located (and linked to the outside armor via magical sensors and motion translators).

  Suitably shaped portal under the feet - you no longer technically have a planet underneath you, so you're not affected by its gravity.

  Suitably sized portals in all directions around you - you now have a planet located in whichever direction you like, giving you up to 1G acceleration in a direction of your choice. Free flight and being able to walk up walls!

  The same portals surrounding an object of your choice? Be a Jedi and move it around with thoughts or gestures.

  Be able to reach into a portal and pull out anything you have stored in a remote warehouse or cave. Super-large bag of holding which is also unstealable.

  Link a portal to a remote environment and point it away from you. You can now summon/shoot anything from blizzards to sandstorms to water to lava to clouds.

  Put portals at either end of any weapon in your warehouse. Cast back-to-back portals in front of you. You can now reach in, fire the weapon, and the result comes out where your hand/wrist would normally be. Small arms fire, flamethrowers, crew-mounted weapons, a Dobie-O-Matic...

  Never have comms cut off again! A portal can go to anything from a radio receiving station to a scribe to someone who is just standing by waiting for you to tell them what you need.

  Shopping - never have to cart around shopping bags or push a cart ever again!

  Trade - never have to travel with goods!

  Choosing where to live - why compromise, when with portals you can put your house in literally any picturesque or low-cost location and have doors leading to all the places you normally visit?
