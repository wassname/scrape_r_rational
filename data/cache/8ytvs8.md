## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  In the roleplaying game *In Nomine,* players may start the game as a Seraph. Seraphim are angels, so they already know a great deal of hidden Truth (mainly that Christian theology is mostly true), but they also have a power that lets them discern truth from lies, called their resonance. Whenever they want, a Seraph can decide that they are activating their resonance, with roughly a 50&#37; chance of success. They know whether they've succeeded, and if they fail it creates a mild discomfort. If they succeed, they know whether or not the next statement they hear from someone else is a deliberate lie. In exchange, Seraphim are forbidden from lying themselves.

  The bit that seemed obviously broken to me in the rules was this: whenever they use this power, there is a 1 in 6 chance that in addition to knowing whether the statement was a *deliberate* lie, they learn whether the statement was actually True. Googling, it seems later editions have tried to nerf this a bit by adding that this only works if the speaker has some connection to the statement, and how much they can learn is limited by the speaker's level of connection. I suspect, however, that this is still broken.

  So, if you were a Seraph, perfectly benevolent towards humanity, unable to lie, and with this ability, how would you abuse the hell out of it before the powers that be yanked you back up to Heaven?

    *First, let's really break this:*

    A high IQ (and/or high Perception) Seraph has a significantly higher than 50% chance of success on the resonance roll, especially in a situation where they are otherwise in tune with the nature of reality.  This is good news, because should the resonance fail they cannot try again to the same purpose for up to six (+2, see below) hours. There is also a flat 1/36 chance during any attempt of infernal intervention which could cause any number of inconveniences, and a 1/36 chance of divine intervention which might point the angel in the right direction? Or not? God works in mysterious ways.

    If the potential truth teller is entirely cooperative the angel might get up to +2 to their chance at absolute truth, upping their odds  from 1/6 to 3/6. Combine this with a high chance of resonance success (along with the fact that they can make successful attempts once per second) and it's essentially a coin flip whether the angel knows the truth of any statement their helpful assistant has the necessary "connection" to utter.

    *As such a Seraph:*

    I'd start by asking experts in various fields who in their field has the most complete understanding of it (starting, of course, with themselves). If they prove not to know this right off the bat, they could supply a list of other experts which can be culled mathematically (starting with "The person with the most complete understanding of your subject is on this list?" of course).

    Then the angel goes to this expert and repeats the process until they find the greatest expert. At that point, they ask this person about the greatest outstanding unknowns in the field, fishing for their understanding of the best theories. It would be relatively easy to guide them in the right direction this way.

    Thus, over the course of a matter of months (largely travel time and scheduling), every major discipline could be advance its fundamental understanding.

    In most cases this wouldn't even require any revelation of my abilities and motives, nor much in the way of motivated cooperation, as these are exactly the sorts of questions that experts love to answer.

    I think the flaw is actually the easiest thing to munchkin. If you can't lie, talk to yourself. I'm assuming they didn't give it a chance to fail?

    "I will find great riches if I walk in this direction for ... 20 miles", etc.
