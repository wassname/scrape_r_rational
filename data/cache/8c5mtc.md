## Looking for a fic involving kinetic bombardment and weaponized mandrakes.

### Post:

Title.

I loosely remember reading an arc somewhere about Harry Potter abusing transfiguration to drop tungsten rods from broomsticks at high altitude and dropping mandrakes to incapacitate ground forces.

Especially the idea of transfiguring tungsten rods sounds a *lot* like HPMOR, but I've just been through the entire thing for a second read and it didn't come up there.

  You're thinking of an unofficial sequel to HPMoR, [Significant Digits](http://www.anarchyishyperbole.com/p/significant-digits.html).

    Unofficial, but with positive mention(s) from Eliezer.
    ```

    - u/tahoebyker:
      ```
      Worth mentioning: I originally had written "the unofficial sequel to HPMoR."

    Do you know the word count of this fic?

      ```
      Just over 300,000
      ```

- u/caverts:
  ```
  Did it also have house elf space marines and some discussion of using temporary transfiguration + an indestructibility charm to compress matter into a black hole? If so, I think it was [this.](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/harry-potter-si.233048/page-17#post-8464838)
