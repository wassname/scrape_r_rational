  It's kind of hard to get invested in the mundane portion of the battle when you know that it'll be the fight between the Named that will decide things in the end.

    Speaking for myself, I just love military fantasy. The tactics and strategy are endlessly fascinating to me, and frankly, we already know Cat is going to win anyways. The real question is who and how many die first.

      Me too. I loved the war college arc and the battle of the five armies and one.

      > we already know Cat is going to win anyways

      This is why at least a few authors will kill off and switch protagonists mid-series.
      ```

      - u/18scsc:
        ```
        Well to be fair Cat HAS been killed off three times.
        ```

    ```
    Personally I love it. The Pivots are the main act of the play but all of this sets the stage.

    Exiled Prince looks at you from the grave, disgusted with prejudice and foolishness) 
    Not talking about the previous Dark Knight and many others.
    ```

  - u/Dent7777:
    ```
    How do you know the day will be decided by Named?

    The way the battle goes for the unnamed will dictate the place, time, and circumstance of any Named intervention.

    We all know how important the details can be when it comes to narrative.
    ```
