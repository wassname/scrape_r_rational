  What. *What*.

  >Even knowing that he left the others to get them help quicker, not to catch a pikachu, he can't just let it get away.

  Blue is darker than I realized...

    It's easy to minimize the distant possibility of a negative thing that might not happen in order to go for a positive that's right in front of you :)

      I have to agree - Blue's depiction in this chapter seemed so dark that I was genuinely surprised when he did the right thing.

      Hmm...so you're saying he's not darker, but dumber?

      I dunno...you are right in principle when it comes to seatbelts or something, but personally I think Blue is currently in a scenario that our childhood of forests and grassland ecosystems has prepared us for. 

      For most people leaving their friends *injured in a fire* surrounded by *electric lions* would be a screaming priority. (But maybe it's a bit of both, in this case?)
      ```

      - u/DaystarEld:
        ```
        A mix of both, I'd say.  The impulse to not let it get away is stronger for him than it would be for Leaf or Red, but not as a matter of intelligence so much as his drive to acquire powerful pokemon.
        ```

          >so much as his drive to acquire powerful pokemon.

          Ah. So you're basically saying he's a Slytherin  haha

          Hmm...is it Dark = Slytherin, Psychic = Ravenclaw now? :P 

          It said most humans were Normal type... I wonder if there are any human Fighting, Dragon, or Fairy types (those being the 5 "abstract property" types, ghost exempt because they're not dead) , and if it correlates with personality in a similar way.

  Blue's kind of thick, isn't he? He really needs to clamp down on his impulsiveness, but it's good to see that when he thinks to stop and think for a moment, he does the right thing. The world will beat some maturity into him yet.

  I'm curious about the straight-up magical absorbing and healing stuff Shroomish is doing. I wonder if Red thinks there's anything curious about it.

  Everything about the Shiftry encounter is quite interesting. Honestly, when it first showed up, I expected it to be a fake-out. They were waiting for a pokemon to cut down a tree, here's a pokemon that can cut down a tree, time to get up, Blue. Which leads to the question: How can you tell a wild pokemon from a trainer's pokemon?

  I think this is the first time we've heard of a limitation on pokeballs. They evidently have an upper limit on physical size... But then they can temporarily store pokemon above that limit? How? I'd expect the mass-energy conversion process to abort as soon as its buffer is full, and for the pokemon to never go inside at all. Of course, in the games, pokemon go in, the ball wiggles, then they pop back out, but I'm not quite sure if the science checks out. Or there may be something I don't know. I'm sure we'll learn more about how they work when our heroes start outgrowing standard pokeballs, if they do.

  The shiftry's behavior suggests interesting things about pokemon intelligence. In our world, the most intellectually complicated predation is to chase the prey into an ambush. These shiftry are significantly more clever than that! They seemed to haved planned to sneak up on helpless prey in the smoke, but then the forerunner got stuck in a losing fight. It nonetheless stood its ground and actually held back, using itself as bait while the rest of its pack got into position. It was either enacting a plan B it had already thought of, or it was improvising a deception using the resources it had. Either way would require a lot of discipline to not just run away when it gets hurt. Very few real world animals could pull this off besides humans. These shiftry are primate-level at least, and I imagine that psychic types are even smarter. I wonder what Leaf would think.

    That was partly why I made sure to note the blood on its leaves ;)  In normal conditions though, a trainer should be within sight of his pokemon at all times.

    >I'm curious about the straight-up magical absorbing and healing stuff Shroomish is doing. I wonder if Red thinks there's anything curious about it.

    Yeah, being a Blue chapter means I was more reluctant to get into technical aspects of things :) 

    So here was how I approached the absorption stuff:

    In the games, absorb looks like literally drawing green light away from them, which somehow is supposed to hurt them and heal you: literally, "life energy." In the anime, they shoot a BEAM of light out, which turns red once it connects to them and again, drains their "life energy."

    Neither of these struck me as particularly usable in my fiction. I'm okay with having some near-mystical abilities, but am trying to limit them by type, and perhaps some very specific pokemon.

    So first, the idea of extracting something through a creature's skin so that it traveled through the air toward you would require some sort of psychic or magic powers, so I dropped that and made moves like Absorb require skin-to-skin contact.

    Second, the glow is bio-luminescence on the plant pokemon's part, of particular cells that glow when they work to repair the body. They use biomatter as fuel/basic parts, and can either gain it through contact (basically eating the skin and flesh from something they're touching) or from nutrients Shroomish takes in.

    The leech seeds feed on blood to grow, and the plant matter inside the shell is full of the nutrients from the host's blood, converted into the best type of food to fuel the pokemon's regenerative cells.

    Does all that make sense?

    >I think this is the first time we've heard of a limitation on pokeballs. They evidently have an upper limit on physical size... But then they can temporarily store pokemon above that limit? How? I'd expect the mass-energy conversion process to abort as soon as its buffer is full, and for the pokemon to never go inside at all.

I'm sure we'll learn more about how they work when our heroes start outgrowing standard pokeballs, if they do.

    This is something I struggled with a lot too.

    So, the main issue with the way the game and anime treats this is it makes no sense (as usual) for a pokemon to "fight" its way out while it's nothing but a ball of energy inside.  Furthermore, "damaging" a pokemon so it can get caught is also weird: does how "tired" or "hurt" it is translate to having "less energy" somehow?

    So I scrapped the idea that any ball can hold any pokemon, and decided to put technical limits on them. The difficulty is in locking on and hitting the pokemon, which requires wearing it down or immobilizing it first. The only way hurting a pokemon can legitimately help you catch one is if it loses so much blood or so many body parts that its mass becomes low enough for the ball to contain it.

    The way I see the tech working, they can hold virtually anything, but it wears out the internal matrix that safely suspends the energy the more energy it's containing.  If you catch something too big, it overloads it very quickly.  Kind of like how you can run X volts through a lightbulb for months, but if you try to shove 3x volts through it, you'll blow it out.

    Does that make sense?

  I liked the Blue vs. Pikachu scene a lot. I'm mainly glad it didn't involve laser-guided karma. A lot of writers would have had his less-than-altruistic decision instantly result in something terrible happening. Yeah, it didn't pan out for him as a trainer wanting a pikachu, but that's enough to drive the point home. I was bracing for the inevitable "AND THAT'S WHY SELFISHNESS IS BAD, MMMK?" moment, but it never came; that was nice. 

  Loving this story so far, keep it up!

  Welcome back everyone! To clarify, "simulations" in this world are basically our world's "Pokemon" games, from the handhelds to far more advanced versions that we don't have access to due to lack of technology and Game Freak's strange aversion to all of my money. This world has video games too of course, but we often use the word "simulation" for a game that mimics something you can do in the real world with an intent toward teaching, so why wouldn't they?

  As always, feedback of any kind is welcome. Enjoy!

    Clear evidence that companies really _aren't_ all [that ruthlessly profit-focused](http://xkcd.com/808/).

    It's like they haven't fully realized yet that their fans have grown up and now own gaming PCs with more than 4MB of graphics RAM.
    ```

    - u/DaystarEld:
      ```
      Or maybe they're just listening to the wrong people ;)

      But yeah, they seem really intent on keeping the "this is a kids' game" demographic.  It's not going to change as long as adults keep buying them, because why spend a ton of money making a pokemon version of, say, Monster Hunter, when that's likely to draw a lot of their customers from the handheld titles?

      I don't think they're giving enough weight to the thought that they might actually appeal to new types of gamers if they release a pokemon game that's NOT cutesy and turn-based.

      Which I wouldn't mind so much if they didn't so ruthlessly issue takedowns against independent designers who make amazing looking games [like this one.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KI6AfK2usjo)

  Typos? Maybe?

  but *none* get close enough to be a threat, I assume

  >just incase

  just in case

  Here, take this.

  >He pulls the lightning rod out where it's wedged

  out *from* where it's wedged, I think?

  Great chapter!  Keep up the good work!  

  >The firebreak is often enough to break it when it goes too far in any direction, but that means it sometimes winds straight against the fire in some areas.

  This sentence struck me as sort of clumsy.  The first "it" is referring to "the fire" I think, but this isn't really clear.  Also, "sometimes... in some areas" could maybe be phrased better.

  >He doesn't know what sense alerted him to its presence

  And this one is backwards I think.  Should be "it to his presence" maybe?

  Do you have a sense of what length story this will be?
