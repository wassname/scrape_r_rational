## Worth the Candle update?

### Post:

Worth the candle hasn't updated in a couple of weeks. Any idea when it's going to update next?

  I don't like such posts. I feel they create an unecessary pressure on the author. He doesn't write on a schedule to avoid the pressure, and now people are asking when will the next chapter be anyways.

    Fair point, I hadn't considered it when asking. 

    The reason I made the post is that it hadn't updated in a while (more so than usual), and I was, well, worried that it died. May have been an overreaction, but please believe me that I found myself checking for an updated multiple times a day.

    So I looked around for any kind of note on why it's stalled, couldn't find anything, and then asked here, where clearly I got my answer.

    If I was aware that the author was on vacation (which was a strong possibility given the summer), well, I'd have just waited patiently. 

    After thinking about it, I still think it's a legitimate reason for a post, but I could have phrased the question differently, and probably would have avoided implying that I'm asking for an update date, as opposed to making sure the story is not dead.

  There were four finished chapters 8 days ago but CRJ wasn't happy with the last chapter as the end of the batch, so he was writing another one. No idea beyond that.

  I've been jonesing too, but I doubt threads like this are particularly useful.  We're not going to know anything unless AW tell us, and the most likely place for an update is here anyway.

  Preparation for big merge - WtC will be merged with APGtE while erraticerrata and alexanderwales will be revealed the same person?
  ```

  ```
  The patreon got updated a few hours ago. So it will be updated in about 20h.

  ```
  This thread is useless. No, no one knows when it'll update. You're just discouraging the author. You're also wasting everyone's time with this kind of thread. What did you hope to accomplish?
