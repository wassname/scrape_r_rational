## Why isn't Asimov mentioned in The 'old masters'?

### Post:

I was surprised to not find Asimov among the 'old masters'
https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index#wiki_defining_works 

I've read several of his books and IMHO they should definitely be considered rational fiction.

  Because the list is not representative nor complete and is fairly subjective. If you are going by this list you are going to get the author's skewed perspective.

  It includes random works that have gotten medium-levels of attention at best while not including better-accepted ones.

  At any rate, I love Asimov, his writing is great and he is at least somewhat 'more rational' than most but clearly they were going for a much more strict definition of 'Old Masters' here. In fact, I think that specific subsection is straight-up just works which Yudkowsky listed in an old comment on LW before this sub even existed.

    I could get behind that definition if things like Worm weren’t listed there. Multiple of Asimov’s novels are far more rationalist than Worm.

    At least EY mentioned "travails of Salvor Hardin in the first Foundation novel" here:

      I would think that both *Foundation* and the *Robot* stories and novels work extremely well as rational fiction - they’re based on something logical - the Three Laws and psychohistory - and their implications are logically analyzed. And there’s some extent of fair-play whodunit here, especially in the *I, Robot* stories.

  I would not say that Asimov's works place any kind of premium on rational worldbuilding, for one. A lot of his stories are about exploring a theme, or an idea, or the effects of technology on human society, and he would then go on to put little work on making the setting make sense beyond superficially. 

  Maybe it's my biases talking but Asimov is my least favourite of the SF golden age big 3. Clarke was dry and Heinlein was preachy, but Asimov is the only one that I feel has no depth to his big ideas, with characters being very similar and often blatantly just narrative vehicles. And even the stories that I really liked(Foundation, for example) I couldn't imagine them as real, couldn't picture myself living in these worlds.

  The 'big three' are Clarke, Asimov, and Heinlien for 20th century science fiction.
