## [D] Rational mind-reading

### Post:

I've been chewing on this one for a long time.

Brain-reading is a technological reality with a number of extant applications, but brains are a relatively uniform hunk of hardware. Most brain development happens in the womb, and most of its structures are evolutionarily ancient. *Minds*, the iterative clumps of memory we call "you" and "I", are individually constructed on a moment by moment basis over the course of our lives.

We may both have comperable things in mind when we think of Idaho or Ronald McDonald, but the architecture of those concepts and the paths our neural impulses make to recall them are certain to be almost completely unique. Layers upon layers of cross-reference have gone into establishing complex referents like those.

Even if I could discern every brain impulse, and separate out the only the mindiest portion, the challenge would be less like someone who speaks only English translating Basque into German, and more like somebody raised by wolves translating Basque into Dolphin.

Is there an obvious solution I'm missing, or is a rational mind-reader stuck cold-reading off of autonomic, sensory, and emotional impulses?

Any fiction recommendations that wrestle with this topic?

  When I hear questions like this on computer forums, usually my first response is "Step back. What are you trying to achieve?"

  If you're trying to write a rational story in which a character has a mindreading ability, you don't need to know the details, you just need to create a setting where there is a plausible explanation.  Every story is allowed one Suspension of Disbelief token--but *only* one[1]--that it gets to spend on its main premise.  Any of these would work:

  * Scientists have spent fifty years building up a database of brainscans of everyone on the planet in realtime as they aged and then supercomputers did frequency and traffic analysis in order to determine correlations so as a result we can read thought-images in real time, although we can't read memories.
  * An alien crashlanded on Earth.  His Universal Translator is damaged but semi-functional, and....
  * We have this person who has this ability.  We don't know how it works but it very clearly does.

    Absolutely, but what makes world design in science fiction fun for me is figuring out the nuts and bolts of how such SoD tokens work. Having the mechanism mapped not only provides the quirks and limitations that keep a story interesting, it can also lead directly to plot points and possibilities I would have never even imagined if I just leaned back and said "A wizard did it".

    That's what I'm trying to achieve: Inspiration via conceptual understanding.

    I generally agree, but thinking about these things can be good for adding in some details to sell your premise. If you have a form of mind-reading that works on "surface thoughts", and you have some relevant scientific literature to back it up, you can describe exactly what different modes of thinking "look like" to your protagonist.

    (Much in the same way that you can "sell" New York City a lot easier than you can sell a fantasy city, because you can just look at New York City and borrow some images that you see there rather than having to make things up.)

  IIRC, the visual cortex is pretty straightforward, to the point that you can crudely map the field of vision into it, and it's credible that it would activate when you think visually. So that's one hook you could start with.

    Is hearing similar?

      I don't know. [This article](http://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech/scientists-develop-brain-decoder-can-hear-inner-thoughts/) suggests not.

  Apparently for at least some processes you may be overestimating the difficulty involved in mind reading.

  If I were trying to create a mind-reader without breaking neuroscience too badly, I'd have their ability tap into the "area" theorized to be the internal/self monitor, responsible for metacognition. I say "area" because, as far as I know, this is one of our higher cognitive functions, intimately tied to consciousness, and at this point, very poorly understood (i.e. it's somewhere in the prefrontal cortex, probably)- which leaves it more open to your fictional fiddling and interpretation than, say the visual cortex or other parts of the 'animal' brain. You could, for example, claim that  it not only receives input from the senses and listens in on the internal monologue, but maybe when memories are recalled they are presented before the monitor. And maybe because the monitor's 'job' is to take all of these neurochemical inputs and observe and understand what they are in the mind it is *in*, it might do the same job for the mind-reader, whose special, extra listening power connects their monitor to others'.
