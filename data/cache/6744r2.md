  An ai wants to commit suicide by moving its programing into a bigger computer?

  Sure thats whats going on.

  An entire internet point on "the ai did it"

    I was under the impression that Sarah's *parts* would be relocated, not her programming.
    ```

    - u/DCarrier:
      ```
      I think the problem lies in confusing her programming with her soul. Then again, they did say it was her intellectual soul.
      ```

- u/CeruleanTresses:
  ```
  So, Sohu knew immediately that Uriel had been killed. I've had a theory for a while that they're kabbalistically married, since Sohu implied having experience with the technique, and keeping in contact that way would have mitigated his sadness at their separation. So it's possible that she actually felt him die. Ouch.
  ```

  - u/Arancaytar:
    ```
    It's possible, but given both of their connections to the celestial Kabbalah, she could probably see his death as easily as she could detect the rivers running in reverse.
    ```

  - u/Takashoru:
    ```
    I believe it was already confirmed that this was the case.

    I believe that it was also shown that after Erica and Dylan died (I think?), Ana recursively inherited some subsection of their minds via their links.

    This, along with evidence this chapter that Sohu is now stronger than she was before, suggests that a significant fraction of Uriel remains in her mind.

    If TCK is TOK, this might have even been intended.
    ```

    - u/CeruleanTresses:
      ```
      Oh, was it confirmed? I've been looking out for confirmation ever since Sohu originally hinted at it, but never noticed anything definitive. If I missed it, I'd like to go back and look. I definitely *want* it to be canon, because their friendship has been the main emotional hook of the story for me, and it would be nice if they were able to keep in touch for all that time.

      ...huh.  I definitely missed that.
      ```

      - u/Takashoru:
        ```
        It was subtle: 67:

        > "Something opened in Ana’s mind. New memories. Knowledge she shouldn’t have. A deep loss."

        > “Black mast, this amulet contains the blood of Malia Ngo. She’s the daughter of Thamiel and Robin West. His blood runs in her veins. Just like on the Comet King’s sword. This is the blood of Thamiel, and I call you to our aid.”
        ```

        - u/CeruleanTresses:
          ```
          That was Erica's knowledge. Erica witnessed Dylan stating that the amulets he was handing out would each have a drop of Malia's blood on them, and she later witnessed Malia revealing her parentage. Therefore, Erica knew that the blood of Thamiel's line was on Mark's amulet.
          ```

          - u/Takashoru:
            ```
            Agreed.  However, Dylan died before Erica, suggesting that he should have SKABMOM'ed into her.  While it is unclear how much transfers, it is within possibility that whatever Erica got of Dylan would have been passed along with her to Ana.

            Nonetheless, the question was about post-death SKABMOM, and that is all but unquestionable.
            ```

            - u/CeruleanTresses:
              ```
              Oh, I thought you were saying she got info from Uriel due to him possibly being part of the kabbalistic chain. My bad.
              ```

  For your convenience, here are the lyrics to HaMephorash, as written by the fictional Leonard Cohen. [Link to the song performed by the Bayesian Choir.](http://slatestarcodex.com/Stuff/HaMephorash.mp3)

  &nbsp;

  Now I've heard there was a sacred word

  That Jala said, and it named the Lord

  But you don't really know of magic, or us

  It goes like this - a tav, a resh

  A fearsome joy, a fervent wish

  The Comet King incanting haMephorash

  &nbsp;

  HaMephorash x4

  &nbsp;

  Your faith was strong but you needed proof

  Hay hay yud tav mem tav vav kuf

  A ship on which another sailed before us

  She saw his flag on the highest mast

  She saw a dream that couldn’t last

  The Comet King receiving haMephorash

  &nbsp;

  HaMephorash x4

  &nbsp;

  You say I took the Name in vain

  And after that I lost the Name

  I gave it back to Him who holds it for us

  But echoes sound in every word

  It doesn’t matter what occurred

  You never really lose the HaMephorash

  &nbsp;

  HaMephorash x4

  &nbsp;

  Somebody had to, no one would

  I tried to do the best I could

  And now it’s done, and now they can’t ignore us

  And even though it all went wrong

  I’ll stand against the whole unsong

  With nothing on my tongue but HaMephorash

  &nbsp;

  HaMephorash x4

  RIP Buffybot. I feel like Scott liked the concept but didn't quite know what to do with it.

  >“Sohu showed you the library? Go get me all the books you can find on Elisha ben Abuyah. It’s time to learn everything we can about the Other King.”

  ~~This ending doesn't seem to make any sense. If they truly knew TOK's identity, and had books on him, as one of the most important foes they faced, surely they'd have researched him already? And well before the current crisis. More importantly, if they think Thamiel and his demons will be upon them imminently, let along TOK, then that leaves absolutely no time for research.~~

  ~~The most reasonable explanation thus seems to get Aaron out of the way and keep him busy? Can't see why they'd really care though~~

  I misremembered, as /u/Fredlage says they figured out TOK's identity very recently in story, in chapter 50, so this in fact makes perfect sense.
  ```

  - u/Fredlage:
    ```
    They just guessed it was him not long ago in story time. Don't remember how many chapters ago it was though.
    ```

- u/Arancaytar:
  ```
  Aw, Buffy doing the self-sacrifice thing again. :/
  ```
