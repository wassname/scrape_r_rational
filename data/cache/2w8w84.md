  The authors note sets you up before you realise it was published single chapter over a year ago. Woe upon us.

    Oh 2014.  I thought it was published yesterday. Dammit

    I was legitimately excited until I noticed that. Now I want a Rational!SoIaF where Joffrey is given "the Draco treatment" and is actually competent rather than a dumb bully.

      Competent Joffrey is (more or less) Roose Bolton.
      ```

        Aye, though the difference in position is significant, Roose being a relatively minor lord (at first anyway) while Joffrey rules Westeros.  I'd be interested to see how a rational leader deals with the whole rebellion, threats reported by the Night Watch, and so on.
