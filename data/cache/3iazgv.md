## Dealing with an Afterlife

### Post:

Scenario 1: You are aware that some form of afterlife exists. You do not know anything about it except that your consciousness is in some way preserved.

Scenario 2: The  afterlife is predicated on a version of heaven and hell, with particularly "evil" people (murderers, corrupt politicians) going to hell and the rest going to heaven.

Given a billion dollars along with this knowledge, what would be your optimal response?

  _"The gods of the Disc have never bothered much about judging the souls of the dead, and so people only go to hell if that's where they believe, in their deepest heart, that they deserve to go. Which they won't do if they don't know about it. This explains why it is so important to shoot missionaries on sight."_ -- (Terry Pratchett, Eric)

  Yes I know I just used the same quote in an HPMoR thread. Still need to keep it in mind here.

  Same thing I'm doing right now, when I have only this life and no reason to believe otherwise: crusin' along, enjoying life, try not being a dick.

  Sounds interesting. If I have suitable proof, present it to the rest of the world. If not, see what I can do about studying the phenomenon. Also examine my own state of mind to try and figure out if I'm not just crazy.

  Other than that, well, a billion dollars is going to change my life quite a bit, but that seems incidental to the question. I wouldn't change my values in any significant way.

  How the heck do I know there's an afterlife but nothing about it's contents? Did Omega tell me about it? Don't answer that.

  Anyway, death is still a bad thing, obviously. This probably has some interesting effects on anthropic edge cases in probability; but since I have no idea how to deal with those, I don't know what those effects are.

  ... I suppose it might be worth killing some highly-trained people to act ass agents in the afterlife, bargain on behalf of humanity, etc etc; but the afterlife is almost certainly inhabited by superhuman forces, all else being equal. Probably not worth it. (You could train people with long-term terminal diagnoses, if you don't think the extra skill bonus from choosing your agents from a larger pool is worth killing people for.)

  In the *second* case, abolishing anything resembling a death penalty and trying *extremely hard* to get anyone with a risk of dying to repent becomes *very important*. Personally, I'd suggest founding a new strain of Christianity, backed by all the rationality your billion dollars can buy.

  I recall a book in which we found this sort of thing out and mounted a military invasion.  Sounds about right.  Waaagh.

  Insufficient data is presented to answer the question. Via what channel has this information about the afterlife's existence (and nature) come to my attention; and how has it demonstrated sufficient evidence to persuade me of its veracity?

    Yep, the same problem that I had with the "you are sudden;y aware you can teleport" thread. The most likely cause of random supernatural beliefs is not that the random supernatural beliefs are real.

  Hire one person to start murdering babies so they can go to heaven and be blissful for eternity.

  Assuming we ignore the go to mental hospital etc.

  When does life begin? At conception? Is heaven overrun by the souls of embryos who failed to implant in the uterine wall, and who outnumber normal humans five or ten to one?

  Case 1: That doesn't tell me much. I don't think I have enough information to decide on a course of action. Well, except that I'd worry a lot less about other people dying. "Natural disaster kills 20,000 people? So what?"

  Case 2: I'd do what many religions have already concluded is the sensible thing to do. Try to get as many people as possible into heaven by "converting" them.

  Whenever there's a thread on the afterlife, all I can contribute is a nifty link to [Bang](http://www.amazon.com/bang-apocalypse-Mason-Tailsteak-Williams/dp/1453806466). Involves at least one afterlife creature who takes ethical principles to the logical extreme.

  What is existence like in hell and in heaven? That's kind of relevant.
