  Eh, there's a colloquial usage of sentience that basically means sapience. It's kind of annoying that that is the case, but I think it's like the word literally. Another English language war we lost, not sure it's salvageable or worth the effort at this point.

  After a look in the dictionary and from memory, sentient is often used as a synonym for conscious. I don't remember if it was you but someone in another thread said that most animals are sentient but not sapient, which is only unambiguously true if we use sentient as meaning able to feel senses rather than possessing consciousness.

  I've always taken 'sentience' to mean sentience, in the stories I've read here. 'Sapience' is rarely used, but 'self-awareness' is common.

  Maybe some authors aren't native speakers.
