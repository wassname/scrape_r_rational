## Super Science and Fast Romance

### Post:

As in the title, I've found this great rational fic. Especially in the sense of exploring topics of trans-humanism, AGI, and building/pursuing plot from the rational outcome of sci-fi inventions.

warning: quite NSFW, lots of mentions of drug use as well (though I think it is legal in the setting, meh).

  This is great!

  It's NSFW, but not particularly explicit. Generally the NSFW parts boil down to "then they had sex" (or "then they wanted to have sex over the Internet, so here's a detailed explanation of the technology that could go in to making that work. Then they had sex over the internet"). 

  Aside from that there's some excellent sci-fi weird dystopia stuff going on - it makes me think of *Accelerando* crossed with *The Diamond Age*, on an acid trip in a strip club.

  Edit: I think this quote perfectly sums up the book.

  I liked it; it has a manic, freewheeling quality.  I really like the absurd positive existentialism; everything's terrible, nothing means anything; let's make things better is very attractive.  That said, the writing is a bit hard to follow because the characters don't really have distinct voices.
