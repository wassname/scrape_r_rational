## [D] Is Permutation City...? [Spoilers for the book by Greg Egan]

### Post:

***Is Permutation City real?***

 I really enjoyed the story, even if the characters were rather bland, Egan's strength is in amazing worldbuilding and genuinely original ideas in the sci-fi genre.

The core idea of P.C. is that a set of laws and a state defined with those laws need not be fully simulated to properly exist. In the climactic scene of the first half, a program has been set up to simulate a few dozen scanned copies of original humans, with all but one in a paused state. The simulation is run, giving the outsiders a view of the first two minutes of the idle city, and then the simulation is deleted.

The weird part comes in that according to the set of laws the simulation was set up under, it had the potential to continue, and the inside view does not cease, allowing the people inside to expand and build a city beyond the complexity of what all the Earth's computer's could simulate at a reasonable speed.

It's a real paradox to me, and I still can't answer the question to my own satisfaction. If P.C. isn't real, then the simulation was a mere formality, the mere invention and definition of a set of universal laws and states couldn't cause it to exist, merely define one that already exists from the infinite possibilities, and an infinite number of Permutation Cities truly exist in the ambit alongside us.

If P.C. isn't real, then what trait does a simulated reality lack that ours does? Do all universes need a framework to run the calculations and derive the results of the laws and current states in order to exist, and if so, doesn't that mean we're a simulation as well?

Either there's an infinite number of beings with an engram identical to mine in every state between superstimulated bliss and superstimulated suffering, or I'm a simulation. I can't see any other answer that doesn't involve special pleading.

  The necessary idea here is called "measure." Also sometimes known as "magic reality fluid."

  Currently, I have lots of measure. But if I do the Schrodinger's cat experiment on myself, so that I have a 50% chance of a radioactive decay triggering lethal poison, I'll have 50% less measure. Or if I drive so dangerously that just a few malfunctioning neurons in another driver's brain would get me into a fatal crash, maybe I lose 1% of my measure.

  Now suppose I go into the Schrodinger's cat experiment, but instead of lethal poison, there is instead chocolate cake. After the experiment, 50% of my measure will be a version of me with cake, and 50% of my measure will be a version of me without cake.

  The more of my measure is given to the version with cake, the more likely it is that I'll have cake.

  In Permutation City, the magically-continued simulation has a lot less measure than the original world. You are therefore less likely to be in a simulation than in the original. Any plan that relies on this happening is a bad one - it should be avoided just like we avoid driving dangerously, or trying to wrestle tigers.

  There are some other issues, like causality and dealing with infinities, but the basic idea is that Permutation-City-style simulations of you have extremely low measure (even though there are lots of them! It's not number that matters, it's magic reality fluid), and so when you look out the window, you will observe the normal world with extremely high probability.

  Before going further, you need to be aware that the ending of Permutation City made absolutely no sense. [Read this fanfic](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5389450/1/The-Finale-of-the-Ultimate-Meta-Mega-Crossover).

    Yeah, I totally agree on that point. The flaw in it was how it added an unfounded anthropic bias, and assuming that if an alternate possible past was calculated, it would retroactively change the universe.

    As for that Fanfic, it's in my to-read list, right after I manage to finish Fire in the Deep without having another existential breakdown.

  Maybe I shouldn't just throw this at you, but https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5389450/1/The-Finale-of-the-Ultimate-Meta-Mega-Crossover

    You may want to check latest developments in cosmology. They've came up with some pretty nifty resolutions to Boltzmann Brains problems.

    Personally, once we start screwing with personal timelines and continuity, the illusion of a continuous existence becomes secondary to the reality from a local omnipresent viewpoint following traditional causal computation. 

    It's like how packs in the fire in the deep (which I'm enjoying so far, it's amazing xenofiction) have a very loose sense of identity naturally, if you split an octet apart, you've got two quads with the same identity, and could run equally baffling thought experiments on them as the Ebborians. 

    Do you really think the anthropic paradoxes are covering the same question though? The primary difference I see is that in all those Ebborian Thought experiments, we know the 3rd POV scenario and rules, which paradoxically screw with the 1st POV's predictive engines. In Permutation city, the reverse is true. We know that PC was defined as a deterministic set of physics laws, with a starting condition that was highly ordered, including copies of people and surrounded by a border of replicators which build a copy of themselves, then become normal computronium ready to be used by the inhabitants. The complexity grows, and eventually the simulation is so large that even if all the matter in the visible universe was converted to computronium and ran until maximum entropy, it still wouldn't be able to reach an end-point.

    What exactly happened when the simulation on earth ended? Is it still being simulated somewhere else in the multiverse, or does the self-consistent system itself exist somewhere? Was the simulation even needed, or are all probable and improbable PCs already existent by that principle multiplied by the infinite possible deterministic models and layouts?

    It's like Greg Egan took the principle that the googolplexth digit of pi is a specific number even if we'll never be able to calculate it, and mixed it with quantum suicide.

  "Real" is causal contact.  The question you're asking doesn't make sense (EDIT: under our current conceptions of the way things work).
