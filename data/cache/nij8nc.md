## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  [Library Unpublished](https://archiveofourown.org/works/11539230/chapters/25908498) munchkinry:

  By arranging a set of written metafictional works (fictional work referenced in other fictional works but not previously existing in reality) you can make an entrance to the library unpublished, an seemingly infinite library containing books referenced by other books.

  At its close layers, the library has books referenced or heavily implied by popular works translated into English: textbooks a Hogwarts students might use, the fictional Red book of Westmarch (the book Tolkien indicated was the source material for Lord of the Rings), a translation of the Voynich manuscript etc.  In the close layer magic either doesn’t work or only has effects justifiable by coincidence or the placebo effect.  The shelf-lined hallways are dangerously, claustrophobically narrow in the close layer, especially around entrances created with the bare minimum number of books. The geometry is only slightly non-Euclidean but is still very disorienting with slanted floors and non right angles everywhere.

  In the intermediate layer, the books get more exotic: books in fictional languages, books only made up and mentioned in private writings or obscure barely read writings, books only referenced by other books in the library itself.  Here you can find a guide to the library if you are munchkin enough to have made up a story describing one.  In this layer, magical effects from books can slightly surpass the placebo effect and coincidence: teaching you impossibly fast speed reading, enhancing your working memory, fictional languages, bending probability, etc.  The hallways are narrow but not outright claustrophobic in this layer.  The geometry of this layer is better understood with graph theory than anything like Euclidean geometry: the connections and intersections of individual hallways are consistent, and the length of individual hallways are consistent, but the way they connect is arbitrary, for example: three hallways will completely ignore the triangle inequality theorem.

  In the deep layers, the magic and books get unpredictable: outright magic works in so far as it doesn’t effect the higher layers, books made of edible material exist, books made of volatile chemicals, books made of magical materials.  Entering this layer for any extended amount of time makes it increasingly difficult to return because you can’t bring magical effects “up”, you have to remove the magic from yourself before returning.  In this layer even connections between hallways and individual hallways are inconsistent, a hallway might be short while traveling in one direction and impossibly long traveling in the other direction.

  To be more specific: an entrance to the closest layer will require at minimum two dozen fictional works, arranged on opposite sides of a narrow hallway.  Skimping on quality/quantity may make an entrance lead to dangerously narrow hallways in the closest layer.

  You can exit the closest layer out of an entrance other that the one you entered, but you will need a very good understanding of the library’s organization to have a chance of finding it.  With good knowledge of library organization it might be under a (subjective) mile of travel even given arbitrarily large real world distance between entrances.  With perfect library knowledge a willingness to briefly travel into intermediate or deep layers as a shortcut, you can get from entrance to entrance in under 5 minutes.

  So you have a potential means of fast travel and a source of magic that only works in a dangerous location.  Any persistent magical effects either need to be justifiable by placebo/coincidence or it the effect and whatever it exists on traps you in the location.  Munchkin ideas?

  * Best money making ideas? Keeping it secret?  Letting it go public?

  * Best (cheapest vs. fastest vs. quality) ways to get the initial two dozen works written, printed, and bound?

  * How to best to use narrow cramped hallways that require around a mile of travel through to keep a moon base or Mars base supplies?

  * What fictional magical effects are worth searching for and utilizing given the risks involved?  (I imagine transporting weakened cancer patients to the deep layers is going to be a logistical challenge).

    Things to do with magic:

    **Magical manufacturing of mundane materials**: Depending on the specific magic, it could be very easy to rearrange some carbon atoms and walk out with a perfectly-mundane diamond the size of your head or a rope made of flawless single-walled nanotubes.  Stretching the rules a bit, healing or biomodification aren't persistent magical effects either, as there's nothing magical about a person without cancer or genetic diseases.

    **Decryption and Detection**: Use unlocking magic to generate the key for an encrypted harddrive, and copy that key onto a mundane medium (eg. pencil and paper).  Alternatively, use advanced non-physical testing, such as testing someone's blood to see the date of their death, a picture of them to find their current location, or a table to see which documents were on it.

    ---

    Ways to make it easier:

    **Telescopes**:  Set up a thing in the appropriately-magical zone, but only observe it remotely, from a lower-magic area using telescopes and mirrors.  This may be more difficult in the shifting, inconsistent high-magic zones.

    No munchkin ideas from me, but I love the idea of "the magical bends" where you have to come up slowly as you purge the magic from your system.

    Some questions:

    1. Is there any connection between the content material of the interior of the Library and the exterior location where that entrance is located?
    1.  Would someone with a Library Sciences degree have any sort of advantage in the Library, or is it completely disconnected from "real" library organization sytems?
    ```

    - u/scruiser:
      ```
      1: The connection between location in the library is subtly dictated by the type and organization of the books used in the entrance.  For a overly simplified example, including in your entrance 3 Hogwarts textbooks, spaced 12 books apart on the left side of the entrance might open up to a section/hallway of the library where books existing in the Harry Potter universe (or in general magical universes) occur every 3 books and textbooks (or in general in-universe educational nonfiction) occur every 4 books.  This leads to several related rules I left out... 

      * Removing or rearranging too many books from a single hallway/section changes the “organization” of that hallway and can change its connectivity/location in the library.  It takes a lot of book taking and rearranging to do this in the closest layer (where magic is scarce), and the deepest layers are so chaotic it doesn’t matter so much, but in the intermediate layers this can be a major hazard where a single critical book you need is hazardous to remove if you were naively counting on retracing your steps afterwards.

      * you can’t reuse books in entrances, you need new books for each entrance, but luckily it is reasonably safe to use books taken from the library in entrances.

      2: I had to look up library sciences... somewhat useful?  In the closest layer: a lot of the organization patterns aren’t too hard to decipher: a text book sort of book every 17 books for several hallways before changing to every 19 books for several hallways before breaking down as a rule entirely, a section leaning towards magical universes, a section leaning towards science fiction, a section between them for universes that are both, a hallway leaning towards a single universe, an (in-universe) old book every 11 books.  The problem is that these patterns are: overlapping and/or fractally embedded in each other: extremely spaced out (I picked smaller prime numbers as simple examples, but some patterns might only be discernible across there or four fight numbers of books), noisy/fuzzy (as to what counts as a category), and such.  In the intermediate layers it starts getting easier: you can leverage books with instructions on quasi-magical techniques to find books or pathways, you can find meta-meta books describing the library itself.  In the deep layers you pretty much have to be heavily leveraging magic to navigate at all.

    Well, I can start with making a few predictions:

    * This lets you fairly easily travel to the Discworld, most likely the Unseen University. As in, straight up walk there, not even having to pick up any of the books. 

    * Be careful thou, you might end up in the SCP universe, for similar reasons.

    * The majority of books in the intermediate layers are extremely repetitive ones randomly generated by Dwarf Fortress, AI dungeon, and other similar procedural games. A large amount of the remainder are the spellbooks of countless DnD wizards.

    * The library is rapidly being taken over by a malevolent superintelligence, spreading outwards from a book made of high grade femtotechnology describing itself in an optimal way to have the properties for taking over the library, generated by this reddit post. It's titled "The Librarian"

    How accurate do these metafictional works have to be in order to generate an entrance? Because if all I have to do is copy the titles for 30 Harry Potter potions textbooks and fill them with lorem ipsum I could probably have that done in a day.

    If not, depending on the quality required some ghostwriters could be hired. Actually, maybe this might be a good application for text generation via GPT-3.

    There's a way to cheese this, if metafiction about new fiction **published by yourself** counts. First, compose and publish an ebook on amazon, a simple 3-page short story about a bookshelf filled with books, explicitly referencing a huge number of made up, extremely thin, single-paged books, with each "book" containing a single word inside. 

    Then, make said books by just printing single words on regular paper. 30 sheets ought to do it, you can make your entrance with these "books"

    Random thought: By actually creating a referenced book, does it go from metafictional to fictional? Does that mean each titled book can only be used for entrance creation *once*? That makes it difficult to use works from popular fiction since metafiction from those will likely have stopped being metafiction if other entrance users exist.
    ```

      >There's a way to cheese this, if metafiction about new fiction published by yourself counts.

      Per the original story this is inspired by... self-published books work

      >explicitly referencing a huge number of made up, extremely thin,   
      single-paged books, with each "book" containing a single word inside.

      According to the more detailed rules I outlined for Krossfiero, this will cause your entrance to open into a less useful section of the library.  For instance a bunch of books composed of single words per page, single page books would open to section of the library that followed that pattern of extremely short and extremely simple books for a large distance and might be harder to navigate without any clearer patterns to search through. The books filled with titles and nothing but lorem ipsum might be especially useless, as you might get a section of library that is full lorem ipsum for miles around.  You could use lorem ipsum books as filler.  Based on the typical patterns of repetition in the library... two dozen good quality books should be good and then you could use various GPT-3 auto-created and lorem-ipsum and one page books as "filler" (to adjust the organizational rules around which books are found in the section of library your entrance accesses).

      >Does that mean each titled book can only be used for entrance creation once?

      Yes, I meant to imply this limitation, and I made it explicit in response to Krossfiero's questions. However, once you have on entrance, you can explore out from it, take a few books from each section you find near your entrance, then use those books to put together another entrance.

      >That makes it difficult to use works from popular fiction since   
      metafiction from those will likely have stopped being metafiction if   
      other entrance users exist.

      That is a good point!  I suppose it means you should keep the entrance creation methods secret, or at least tightly controlled, and/or form a collaborative project around avoiding creating the same metafictional work and thereby negating its usefulness.
      ```

      - u/fish312:
        ```
        Actually even with that limitation the library is still really useful for other purposes. I haven't read the source material so I don't know how complex the entrance ritual is, but if you can get the library to recognize a stack of post-it notes with single words as a bundle of books, you've just got yourself an *instant extradimensional space* that you can pop in and out of at will. 

        Portable camping tent, hiding spot, temporary storage, whatever you wish. Maybe fast travel too, I don't know.

        You don't even have to *use* the functions in the library, but hey, easy nuclear waste disposal, anyone?
        ```

        - u/scruiser:
          ```
          The source material presents multiple contradicting explanations for the library in the form of a CYOA, I took one of the more supernatural explanations and tried to come up with a simplified mechanism for accessing it.

          As for the post-it note exploit... at minimum size the passages through the library are cramped, narrows hallways, but still recognizably hallways, and the entrance needs to roughly match in width, so no bag-of holding “entrance” used as storage.  I guess you could fit an entrance in a larger boat or spacecraft or maybe even mobile home though and make use of the extra dimensional space that way, so good munchkin!

  *NOTE: I am aware that this is not a classic munchkin scenario, but I still decided to post it here out of curiosity. I hope that the Sneer Club won’t downvote me too much.*  


  So, you’ve been contacted by magical entity which decided to reveal you some secrets about the universe. For the sake of simplicity, let’s assume that you have already proven beyond doubt that this entity is trustworthy, but you can’t prove it to anyone else because entity already left.  


  The secret that has been revealed is that every fictional universe that is described well (let's say written down or animated or simulated) enough outside human imagination comes to life in some other universe and all its inhabitant are as aware as us. They feel, suffer, experience emotion, etc.  
  This of course already has great ramifications, because you realize that by creating a novel, or a Harry Potter story, you pop this universe into existence and make all the characters as real as you and they experience all the pleasures or suffering of the plot.  


  Of course, you are in our real universe and can’t contact them.

  *(you also realize that if that's the case, then you might be yourself made by someone's else description of munchkinry scenario!)*  


  So, the question now is…. **Under your current morality and utility function** (feel free to describe it), **what do you do?** Do you ignore this stuff completely, or do you try to stop creation of well, sad stories, and start creation of stories full of  happy beings?

    Alicorn already learned about this, and this is the purpose for which Effulgence, and Glowfic in general, exists.

    How do multiple versions of the story interact?  How unique do the stories need to be?  How much of an audience do they need?  If I write down 20 fanfics  of Harry Potter where meanwhile in America a middle age muggleborn has finished their just-fix-everything-forever spell are there now 20 Harry Potter universes living in post Scarcity bliss?  What about continuations or sequels (both fanon and canon and AU spin-off)?

    An obvious trick seems to be: take a upgraded version of GPT-3, tie it into a script with a bunch of crossover characters good at fixing universes (lets say... Zelretch, HJPEV, Shinji and the Warhammer 40k Shinji, various Bels and Maitmos from Alicorn and Lintamande’s glowfics, Amaryliss from WtC, Buddha, liberal progressive Jesus, memetic Batman, a millennia old brain upload of datapacrat from Orion’s Arm, and the Doctor at a relatively moral point in their character arc, just to name a few), and then churn out fanfics that end right as this team is introduced to a new universe to fix.

    Then I’ll take a stab and trying to fix this universe, and all stories generated within, by summoning the team from the Ultimate Finale of the Final Meta Mega Crossover.  I know you said that they can’t affect the real world, but I think just presenting the problem to them in a story and describing my current world would be enough... actually, I can statistically guarantee that I am in a fictional world by slamming stories about myself...
    ```

  - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
    ```
    I assume you can't just write omnipotent benevolent planeswalking fictional characters that can fix everything in the entire omniverse, including your own plane of reality?

    Then there are some questions to consider: can stories write themselves? Let's say you write a story halfway and then stop. Does the corresponding fictional reality simply pause in time until you continue? Is every fictional character ever created inevitably become stuck  forever in a reality where time has stopped forever because no one is writing the story anymore? Are the characters still sapient and fully experiencing this frozen hell in a "I have no mouth but must scream" manner? 

    How about plot holes and contradictions and paradoxes? "This anvil weighs 1 gram. This anvil also weighs 100 kg. This anvil falls on top of character A". Now is character A in horrible pain from being crushed by a 100kg anvil, or completely fine from being hit by a 1 gram anvil? Which is it!? Or does character A not feel anything at all unless I write that character A feels something? But if characters only feel what they are written to feel and think what they are written to think, in what way can they be called as aware as the authors? What if I write "Character A is currently more happy than Character A's current happiness?" How would the fictional reality even interpret such a paradox? Would the book you are writing just catch fire to stop you from writing logical paradoxes?

    What happens if you write vague statements like "and they lived happily ever after"? Does the fictional reality fill in the blanks somehow with fun activities for the characters to engage in? Or are the characters just magically happy ever after for no reason? Can I just smack a sentence "everyone lived happily ever after" at the end of every story and that fixes everything even though I didn't bother to address plot holes and paradoxes like everyone being dead or genetically incapable of happiness?

    Do characters even exist off-screen? Once a character walks off-stage (like away from the narrator's POV), do they just cease to exist until they next appear in the story? Do they even need to go off-stage? What if multiple characters are having a conversation? Do the characters that aren't currently speaking exist? Do they exist but can't do anything other than watch and listen to the one character that is speaking? Can they take any off-screen actions as long as they don't interrupt the current speaker and resume their positions once its their turn to speak?

  **Power:** You can teleport up to 1km while carrying up to 200kg of matter (not including yourself).  If you completely focus you can use it \~20 times per minute.

  You can only teleport places you've been before and remember or places you can see with unaided vision.

  Velocity equalizes with your surroundings at your destination.

  In order to bring something along, you need to be directly touching it, or be teleporting along with something that you are touching and is touching it, etc- there needs to be an unbroken chain of physical contact. You can teleport other people, but only if they consent. They notably don't get to withdraw consent whenever you choose the destination, so if you trick someone into accepting you can e.g. teleport them 1km directly upwards and kill them.

  **Setting:** Generic science fiction in which teleportation is known, but rare. Being able to teleport this frequently, these distances, with this much mass, and for free, is extremely rare- this particular power is roughly one in ten million.

  **Objective:** Whatever you want. I'm mostly interested in fun gimmick ideas.

    Break Conservation of Momentum for free?  Your interplanetary spaceship just got a new drive.

    1. Get a hollow capsule that bounces from end to end on the spaceship, taking at least 3 seconds for each transit (probably more for safety, or 6 seconds for doubled efficiency).

    2. Teleport 200 kg into the capsule as it is moving forward.  Teleport yourself out.

    3. It hits the front and transfers momentum, you teleport the mass out.

    4. It hits the back and *doesn't* transfer momentum (because the 200kg is outside of it)

    5. Send the empty capsule forwards, repeat from step 2.

        Similar idea, but a magical mass driver.  Current-day centrifuges can spin with edge speeds exceeding 3 km/s.

        Can you use a regular rifle to ~~accelerate yourself~~ *change your velocity* at ~10g in space?  

        1. Fire a bullet at 300 m/s relative to yourself

        2. Teleport next to it and match its velocity, since in space it *is* your surroundings.

        3. Fire a bullet at 300 m/s relative to yourself (600 m/s relative to step 1)

        4. repeat.

        With a more advanced launcher you could do even better than 300 m/s every 3 seconds, as long as you have the reaction time to jump after firing instead of needing the entire time to recover/target after shooting.

        You could make an Earth-Mars transit in under an hour when they are at their closest using that method, assuming you don't have to slow down at the end.

    * **Land warfare:** You can teleport over targets with ~200kg bombs. These could be air-bursting thermobaric explosives, small JDAMs, napalm, or cluster munitions which disperse smaller fragmentation explosives to handle infantry, or anti-personnel or anti-tank mines to make an area impassable. You could deploy one of these every six seconds within a range of about a kilometer and you'd be immune to anti-aircraft missiles. You could be targeted by machine guns, but your sudden appearance and downward acceleration would make you a hard target, and possibly impossible to hit if you're suddenly appearing straight above the target, especially if the sun is overhead.

    * **Naval warfare:** Similar to land warfare, though engagement ranges will usually be well beyond the distance you can teleport in one shot. You might need to travel up to 300+ km if you're starting from a surface ship, which would take a good 30 minutes round-trip. If you start from a submarine instead, you could be much closer to the target. You could deploy small torpedoes or drop small naval mines directly into the path of the enemy ship.

    * **Aerial warfare:** You can move at 1,200 km/h (just under the speed of sound) and could carry a pair of AIM-9 Sidewinders, and maybe a small targeting system for them. You'd be pretty much immune to enemy missiles by teleporting every three seconds, and guns wouldn't be likely to fare much better. So you'd effectively be a small, stealthy, short-range air superiority fighter.

    * **Medevac:** You could do mid-air personnel transfers without needing to land. For example, a C-130 Hercules could be outfitted and staffed to serve as an airborne operating room and trauma ICU. You could teleport from the C-130 to the ground, pick up the wounded person, and then teleport with them straight back to the operating room, providing care faster, with less risk of getting shot down, and without needing to risk moving the casualty to an open clearing. A C-130 is twice as fast as a UH-60 Blackhawk, has almost eight times the range, and almost 16 times the carrying capacity allowing it to be very well stocked and staffed. When you get back to a field hospital, you can teleport casualties to the ground to avoid yet another landing, making the whole process drastically faster.

    * **Hostage rescue:** If you can see where the hostages are, you can possibly extract them while the hostage-takers are distracted, or while smoke/tear gas obscures their vision. You could also pull passengers and crew off of a passenger airliner in flight, especially if an empty airliner can be sent to intercept and follow it.
    ```

    - u/Norseman2:
      ```
      A bonus section (to cover /u/Valeide 's sci-fi setting):

      **Space warfare:** Engagement ranges will be even worse than naval warfare, and engagement speeds will likely be so fast that your near-speed-of-sound teleportation won't help. However, you can still act as a surprisingly deadly weapon.

      Suppose you're on one of two ships which spins up a thin ring made of boron nitride nanotubes, with a radius of about 500 m, supported by spokes made of more boron nitride nanotubes. They're spun up on a magnetically-levitated axle until the edge of the thin ring is moving at about 1% of the speed of light. A powerful laser on the ship is used as a spotlight to indicate the part of the ring you need to teleport to.

      You teleport near that point on the ring with a 190 kg missile and <10 kg space suit + oxygen tank, and you immediately end up on a near-collision trajectory towards the target at about 3,000 km/s. Unfortunately, this means you can't just teleport straight back, and even if you passed by a drone which is maintaining distance relative to the launching ship, you'd still need to travel at least 9,000 km to get back which would take 7.5 hours. This is why there's a second ship of the same type.

      Your trajectory will bring you within 1 km of the second ship (and several beacons in front of and behind the second ship, maintaining distance with it, so you can teleport to one of them if you miss). You'll teleport onto the second ship and then teleport near its ring at the correct point to be placed on a trajectory back towards your original ship, about 9,000 km back in the direction you came from, which will have its own beacons to help catch you if you miss the ideal timing. You teleport back onto your ship, grab another missile, and then teleport back towards your ship's ring to launch the next missile.

      You could conceivably launch a missile like this every minute or so, and the missile could make fine adjustments to correct its course early on, once you're clear of it. These missiles could traverse the minimum distance between Earth and Mars in about five hours.

        ```

        - u/Norseman2:
          ```
          Three options:

          * **FTL:** Per /u/Valeide the setting has ships with FTL. You could have a ship with FTL intercept your course and deploy additional beacons ahead of you to give you further chances for recovery. This could also be repeated if you miss again. This is the easy solution, but if it's not an option for some reason:

          * **Life support interceptor:** You could have a life support vehicle with chemical rockets and additional deployable beacons positioned about 30 minutes ahead of where you would be on the expected trajectory. With a 500 m ring, if your teleportation error is within +/- 0.5 m, your trajectory would end up being within +/- 0.23° of the goal, or +/- 6,700 km after 30 minutes. Of course, you could also move yourself about 36,000 km over this same timespan, so, conceivably you could just keep lining up with your target as needed. However, if that's not possible, the life support interceptor would only need about 3.7 km/s of ∆v to put itself on a course to intercept you. If it can complete its burn in about a minute, it could then give its beacons about 30 minutes to spread out and then match velocity with it as they intercept your course.

          * **Self-rescue:** If you're being fired towards Mars (or some other planet), you could adjust your course to maintain a skimming-intercept. Basically, line up so you approach the edge of the atmosphere, such that you'd skim through the upper atmosphere if you did nothing. As you're passing through, teleport deeper into the atmosphere to nullify your speed and allow you to get to safety. Best case, you'll be a saboteur behind enemy lines, worst case, you'll become a POW. Of course, if you miss the timing on this as well, FTL is going to be the only possible way to save you.

    Really dumb idea: Use this for cheaply launching micro satellites. There are a lot of problems with this idea, but I think you can still make it work. 

    Existing velocity relative to earth cancels out every time you teleport, so assuming you teleport vertically upwards once every 3 seconds, gravity only lowers you by 44.1m, so you can cover 1000-44.1=955.9m per teleport at a consistent pace. 

    But wait, orbiting also requires going very fast, in a direction orthogonal to the planet. Well true, but the propellant required would be significantly lower, since you don't have to waste a huge amount fighting drag forces in atmosphere. So bring your sat-rocket up vertically some distance above low earth orbit, release it and teleport away, then allow it to start a burn and accelerate horizontally into a circular orbit.

    Make sure you bring a spacesuit and a parachute.

  You are Isekai'ed as Dolorous Edd into the world of A Song of Ice and Fire. Your mind simply replaces his. Your goal? Become the King of the Seven Kingdoms and sit on the Iron Throne. Whatever gods decided your fate decreed that if you fail the task, you will be sent to the Seven Hells  to suffer for all eternity.

  By the kindness of the Gods, you get 100 lives to enact your plan. Whenever you die, your mind is sent back to the beginning to try again, with the memories of previous attempts. A tattoo indicating the number of lives left appears on your forearm.

  Each life, you wake up in Edd's body on the night Waymar Royce dies.
