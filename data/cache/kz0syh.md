  I actually liked this one. Not much plot development, but a little bit. Setting up conflicts with the mayor and the crimson swords, longer term plans of farming the crack, Ameliah actually acknowledging that they need a room together. And biggest of all, our first actual lead in like a hundred chapters on potential higher than level 20 monsters.

    Call it filler, it is what it is. There are 2 more of this coming up before something plot relevant happens.

  It occurs to me that Rain's purity aura casts light. Do you suppose that there might be some way to enchant a crystal or something with a low level purity spell as a way to make light? Might run into the same issue as everburning torches in the long term, but at least it would draw on different resources - purity cysts instead of fire, maybe.

    Magical light exists in the world already, so hacking Purify to make one would be kind of like clobbering an air dehumidifier to shed light instead of just buying a desk lamp.

      A single tool that lights up a room and cleans the contents at the same time probably has some space in the market that's not covered by separate tools doing one of the jobs and not the other.

      At the very least it has pranking potential in replacing a bathroom light. "For some reason whenever I get up to pee in the night, I suddenly stop needing to as soon as I lift the toiet seat?"
      ```

        It seems logical that purify has a higher runtime cost than a light spell, since purify only generates light while running and performs additional functions. Purify also seems to need a user to imbue it with subjective meaning in order to operate, so that can be chalked up to additional operating costs.

        So you'd get 'light + purify', at a higher cost than just 'light'. Except once a space is clean, purify still consumes mana / resources but does not provide any additional benefit over a generic light source; other than the fact that it would also remove any new waste introduced to the space.

        Toilet-light is a poor use-case, if you have access to purify, you would no longer build or need bathrooms.

        Purify as a lightbulb would probably be useful while performing dirty jobs like mining. Running purify in checkpoints or high traffic areas might be worthwhile too.

  Thanks for the chapter. I like these little slice-of-life + worldbuilding chapters.
