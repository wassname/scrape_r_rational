  There's been a group of particularly good fictions on RoyalRoad recently that I think people here will appreciate: 

  * [The Way Ahead](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/42202/the-way-ahead) - it's got those great early Delve vibes, but the MC doesn't have nearly as much plot armor as Rain. Note that there *is* a "you ran your mouth off about advanced technology so now we're locking you in a room until you can give it to us" slavery arc, but it's quite short - it's already resolved on Patreon. This is also one of the few stories I've read that has *actual* science in it, not just "whoa science is amazing" faffing around. 
  * [Mark of the Fool](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/41618/mark-of-the-fool-a-progression-fantasy) - not a LitRPG despite calling itself a "progression fantasy", this story is great if you're in to power munchkinry. The MC receives a "Mark" that makes him great at any task not involving combat or magic, but unable to fight or cast spells; the MC then has to figure out the mechanics of the mark (what does it *mean* to be unable to fight? what does it *mean* to be good at setting up a campsite?), and either leverage or work his way around them. It spends less time than I would like on the munchkinry, but it's still good. 
  * [Wizard's Tower](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/41881/wizards-tower) - a ~200 year old incredibly powerful wizard in a LitRPG setting decides it's time to quit his job as Headmaster of the magical academy he founded and go build a tower in the middle of nowhere to do the sort of research people might object to happening in a city. I really like the characterization of the MC in this story; he's very clearly suppressing a lot of the emotions he's built up over the years. His rationality feels like a thin veneer and he's barely managing to hold it together, but he's really good at lying to himself.
  * [Evil Eye](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/41836/evil-eye) - Probably the least rational of the bunch as a story, but the main character is probably the most rational out of all the characters here. He's only about average when it comes to intellectual intelligence, but (aside from a glaring weakness in the first chapter) he's probably one of the more emotionally intelligent characters I've read recently. The story summary does make him sound kind of like an incel, but I promise that's not what's going on. You'd be better off just reading the first chapter to get a read on the character.

    I second Wizard's Tower. For a "rough draft", it's already far better than most of the stuff on RoyalRoad.

    Mark of the Fool was interesting enough for me to finish what's posted, but felt a bit tropey, and I'm not sure where it's going. Might pick it up again in the future once it's a bit longer. Titling it "A Progression Fantasy" was definitely a poor choice, because, first, putting the genre in the title is a bit weird? It works better on a physical book cover as a sort of subtitle, but even that I would raise my eyebrows at. In a web fiction format, it's just strange. Second, progression fantasies aren't necessarily powerwank murderhobo stories, but boasting about being a progression fantasy sure makes it sound like you are—which Mark of the Fool isn't. All in all, it was much better than I expected from the name. Once again, better than most of the stuff on RoyalRoad, but this time mostly because that's a pretty low bar to clear.

    The Way Ahead was way too stream-or-consciousness for me to stand. It's a characteristic RR writing style. Not wrong, because language is arbitrary and "good" style is a matter of current convention, but I personally find it unbearable. 

    Haven't read Evil Eye.

  I feel the need to preface this by saying that I am not a socialist. Up until around 30 years ago, half of my country was under the rule of a socialist dictatorship, and that was not at all a great time for anyone.  
  However, these last few days I more or less stumbled upon a succession of stories dealing with socialism from various angles, or at least giving perspectives on it, and I think some of those stories would be interesting to the people here on this server. I don't intend to discuss politics here beyond what is needed to talk about the books, but... yea.

  First, I read Orwell's [**1984 - A Novel**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1984_(book\)).  Everyone here should be familiar with it on principle, but I doubt most people have read more than the wikipedia summary. It's... yea. It's pretty fucking bleak, and not in the way Wildbow's stories are where the main character gets the occasional *fuck yea* moment to compensate for the inherent hopelessness of the setting. I still think there's value in reading this story, beyond the more than decent prose. Because just as much as the story is about grinding, lethal inevitability, it's also about resilience and finding your small nieches of happiness in the face of already certain doom.

  Afterwards I got my hands on [**Animal Farm**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Farm), Orwell's other anti-totalitarian book, this one a rather funny satire. Worth reading just for the final sentence:

  >No question, now, what had happened to the faces of the pigs. The creatures outside looked from pig to man, and from man to pig, and from pig to man again; but already it was impossible to say which was which.

  After these two, I found it hard to believe that Orwell was actually a Socialist himself, and wanted to get started on [Homage to Catalonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homage_to_Catalonia), where he recounts his experiences as a volunteer for the Worker's Militia in the Spanish Civil War. However, while cleaning up my ebook library, I found a book called [**The Cassini Division**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_MacLeod#Series) which I'd read as a child without understanding anything, and learned it was part three of a series. So I set to reading that series instead.

  The article I linked above is for its author, Ken Macleod, instead of the book, because as it turns out, that series isn't all that well known. Which is a damn shame, because I thought it was a great read. Macleod's protagonists run the leftist gamut^1 from communists, trotzkyists, libertarians, and socialists to anarchists. They are united in two things only - their faith in technological progress, and that they really *believe* in their faction's creed, and will fight and kill for it.  

  ^1 : The only traditionally Leftist faction that is never shown anything but disdain are the Greens. In these stories they are either a nuisance, smelly barbarians who attack people from horseback, or dangerous maniacs who destroy research labs and rocket bases.

  The first story, [**The Star Fraction**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Star_Fraction) takes place after a Socialist reformation in England which was stamped out in the aftermath of a hot nuclear war in Europe, and follows Moh, a Trotzkyist militia leader (and his gun) in the splintered small communities which were allowed self-government in the north of London. Supporting characters are a scientist in memory drugs, and an atheist youth who grew up in one of the Christian Fundamentalist enclaves. They are brought together by the plans of an advanced financial AI which was programmed by Moh's father with the covert goal of planning a new socialist revolution, but has attained sentience since then.

  Book two, **The Stone Canal** (no wikipedia entry) is told non-linearly, and follows John Wilde through the confusing years of the socialist reform, the restauration, and the socialist revolution from book 1. In contrast to the first book's protagonists, he's a fanatical libertarian, who carries his convictions to the utmost limits; for example, he purchases the option for a retributive nuclear attack from one of the USSR's splinter states. In the second timeline, which is told interspersed between that one, John Wilde wakes up after his death on a foreign planet in the process of being terraformed by a libertarian capitalist anarchy. The book is about piecing together the events that led to this state of affairs, as well as an exploration of personhood and AI rights. It also captures the despair and disorientation that the fall of the Soviet Union must have caused in Leftist people during the late 80ies and 90ies.

  The third book, **The Cassini Division** (no wikipedia link), is back in our solar system, after a general collapse of society first due to a series of pandemics which were either caused or left to run their course due to anti-science factions having taken over most of the world and a series of viruses which destroyed much of the remaining infrastructure, and the following reorganization of Earth as a unified socialist utopia. Those viruses were the work of a species of uploaded human consciousnesses, which built themselves a habitat out of intelligent matter in Jupiter over the course of book two, but degenerated into madness in their accelerated hardware. This book focuses on Ellen May Ngwethu, member of the Star Fraction from book one, a socialist and warrior to the core, who has made it her life's goal to eradicate the uploaded minds. Much of the book is spent exploring this new socialist society, and later on contrasting it to the equally utopical capitalist society on the planet from book two. What's fascinating is that their version of socialism seems to be founded upon a bastardized kind of Ayn Rand's [Objectivism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivism), which is just fucking wild. That tidbit aside, the story is mostly transhumanist hard sci-fi with a side order of deterrence mind games.

  Then, finally, I back to Orwell's [**Homage to Catalonia**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homage_to_Catalonia). I'm not yet finished with this story, but I wanted to write this entry before I start forgetting details from the first books, and anyway we all know how the Spanish Civil War ended. So, this story is hard to classify; it's certainly not a war diary, it was edited *from* Orwell's diaries but lacks the immediacy of those. It's also not an autobiography, covering only a short time span and not concerning itself with Orwell's person all that much. I'm almost tempted to call it a travel report, except the travelling was done mostly via trains full of soldiers, either towards or away from the front lines of the Spanish Civil War, where Orwell fought as part of the Worker's militia POUM. I really liked his writing style and occasional British humor. I mean, read what he had to say about being shot in the throat by a Fascist sniper:

  >The wound was a curiosity in a small way and various doctors examined it with much clicking of tongues and *‘Qué suerte! Qué suerte!’* One of them told me with an air of authority that the bullet had missed the artery by ‘about a millimetre’. I don’t know how he knew. No one I met at this time—doctors, nurses,   practicantes , or fellow-patients—failed to assure me that a man who is hit through the neck and survives it is the luckiest creature alive. I could not help thinking that it would be even luckier not to be hit at all.

  Also, I especiallly liked the experience of comparing and contrasting his account of the revolutionary anarchist and socialist society he found in Barcelona 1936 with the fictional societies that Macleod invented for his stories, and with the societies from Orwell's novels.

    Animal Farm is has one of the funniest fanbases around because 95% of it is diehard capitalist types talking about how it's a damning indictment of the horrors of socialism when the moral of the story is that "when authoritarian socialism goes bad it's no different than capitalism."You see some of this in 1984 too, although unlike animal farm it also has some other messages in it. I'm personally not really a fan of either book and think Eric Blair was kind of an idiot, but at least to his credit he had what it took to fight fascism even when his own country was not at risk, so that's soemthing. As for the literary merits, aside from my own criticism I do heavily reccomend Asimov's commentary on the book: http://www.newworker.org/ncptrory/1984.htm .
    ```

    - u/BavarianBarbarian_:
      ```
      Asimov was reviewing the book by judging it against how closely it matches the *actual* geopolitical situation, which is about the most useless metric I've ever seen employed in a book review.
      ```

      - u/TitansTrail:
        ```
        Not just that, he misses the point on nearly everything. He says the telescreens are implausible because it would take too much manpower to watch everyone all the time - but of course the point is that somebody *could* be watching you at any time, not that they *are*. He says that the telescreens never seem to break down even though everything else is decaying, but that's to show how this society prioritizes repression above all else - the Party *could* prevent everything from decaying, but they choose not to in order to grind their citizens down through artificial scarcity.

        He says that Newspeak has always been with us, because languages change over time to suit their speakers - but of course the point of Newspeak is to drive a wedge between the Party and the proles, and to make it more difficult for its speakers to express themselves by cutting out shades of meaning. The contractions are meant to facilitate speech without thought, which is similar to but distinct from making it more convenient to speak. It gets changed artificially, not organically, and once it's finalized it will remain the way it is forever.

        I think this man was looking at the book in entirely the wrong light to see its merits. Still, it's nice to hear about how the book was received back in the 20th century, and to hear Asimov's perspective on Orwell's life. I never realized he died in 1950. I wish he'd survived to see the 60s, 70s and 80s.

        Asimov is reading the book to learn about Orwell, which is one way to read the book, and I think some of his points are quite reasonable. Asimov does take a sort of broadside approach where a lot of the points he makes don't seem relevant, but a lot of them are worth reading.

        I do wonder if he's responding to a part of the discussion we're missing where lots of people in Asimov's time insist on interpreting 1984 more literally as a prediction of the world's political future.

    *Homage* is a good read. I'd call it a memoir. Certainly has travelogue elements. The description of la Sagrada Família alone is worth the price of admission.
    > For the first time since I had been in Barcelona I went to have a look at the cathedral–a modern cathedral, and one of the most hideous buildings in the world. It has four crenellated spires exactly the shape of hock bottles. Unlike most of the churches in Barcelona it was not damaged during the revolution–it was spared because of its ‘artistic value’, people said. I think the Anarchists showed bad taste in not blowing it up when they had the chance, though they did hang a red and black banner between its spires.

    Harsh. They never did finish that church, they're still working on it.

    I feel like *1984* and *Animal Farm* are required reading, if only to understand that totalitarianism isn't a left or right phenomenon.

    If you haven't already, read the short and worth it [Politics and the English language](https://www.orwellfoundation.com/the-orwell-foundation/orwell/essays-and-other-works/politics-and-the-english-language/). If you want to keep going down the socialist utopian rabbit hole a bit further, [News from Nowhere](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3261) is pretty interesting / entertaining.

    Thanks for the post.

    I'm not sure I've ever seen anyone call Libertarians "leftists" before. Which probably just goes to show the inadequacy of the single axis "political spectrum"
    ```

    - u/None:

      Libertarian is, originally speaking, a term for anarchists, who are definitely a left wing movement even if they went separate ways from the socialists with the Second Internationale. In an american context, Libertarian generally refers to right libertarian exclusively. Non universal terminology is a real barrier to communication.
      ```

    - u/BavarianBarbarian_:
      ```
      The guy I'm perhaps mischaracterizing as a libertarian is definitely anarchist, so that's sort of on the left wing. However, he's not for the abolition of property and commerce, so not traditionally left either. What would be a more accurate term? Ancap?
      ```

      - u/DangerouslyUnstable:
        ```
        I mean, I can't comment on what the best term to characterize a character I haven't read. I also wasn't necessarily intending to say it was "wrong" per se, just unusual (in the American context anyways). Libertarians have a bunch of stuff that they agree and disagree on with both the left and the right (how much with either side depends on the individual Libertarian, in my experience), but in the US, libertarians are usually characterized as "right" wing. I personally think that's equally incorrect, mostly because a single axis (or even the two-axis version) is a really terrible way of characterizing any political ideology (which is on top of the idea that "political ideologies" more generally are, in specific terms, kind of incoherent things on their own. It's common, and a convenient shorthand usually, but also almost always incorrect in the details.

        My comment was really just to point out an unusual (again, in the US) categorization, not to try and suggest you were wrong or that you should change it. It's entirely possible that the character has large overlap with both libertarians and leftist policies.
        ```

      - u/PastafarianGames:
        ```
        In the context of US politics, "abolition of property and commerce" isn't even a political position, much less the definition of "traditionally left". Traditionally left positions would be, at this point, things like "we should have single-payer healthcare", "we should price externalities into the costs of doing business", and "the rich should actually pay taxes, rather than being permitted to evade them".

        Libertarianism as a political philosophy is defined by property rights (they're for them). This is unrelated to Anarchism, which is defined by consensus-based structures of political power and an opposition to power hierarchies. I won't say they're inherently incompatible, but at least in the USA, Libertarians are distinguishable from Republicans only by their desire to legalize marijuana while Anarchists (what very, very few there are) are mostly associated with the kind of "way to the left of the Democratic Party" types who focus on local politics and do things like run free fix-your-broken-headlights clinics.
        ```

        - u/FlippantGod:
          ```
          Legalization of marijuana is hardly the only distinction. Libertarianism is strictly for a reduced government; whereas the conservative right is likely to support military spending, and the liberal left is likely to support expanding welfare spending.

          Libertarians are generally pro individual freedoms, and thus pro guns, but there is also overlap with pacifism, whereas the conservative right does not particularly share that overlap, and skews towards certain religious views on personal freedoms.

          Libertarians are pro free-market capitalism, but some also want certain taxes and restrictions on corporations that would operate at expense to individuals, such as pollution or consuming limited resources.

          Personally, I support taxes on fossil fuels which should support certain renewable energy sources. I also support coops, net neutrality (yes I do want common carries who cannot have a conflict of interest due to the physical constraints of running cables to houses or on telecom poles, etc), and the right to repair. These are not generally seen in the conservative right.

          Although people like to consider Libertarians to be a joke, I consider my personal political views to be rather rational. I do not believe the government can operate efficiently or compete in the free market. Thus, the government should not be responsible for paying for these things. Thus, the government does not need such a large budget.

          So the intent is to reduce government spending, reduce taxes, and deliver better results at a lower cost. If we reduce the government spending, and taxes, we also reduce the bureaucratic overheads. And if we have managed to reduce the operating budget to something we can afford with simpler taxes, those are further gains. For example, rather than sales tax and income tax, I prefer land value tax. Property tax is also good. These taxes have the advantage of being very difficult to avoid.

          Edit: also, in a similarity with anarchists, Libertarians place more emphasis on local politics.
          ```

          - u/PastafarianGames:
            ```
            I would say that in the context of the United States, what you describe as Libertarianism simply isn't recognizable when put side-by-side with the political movement holding the same name. On nearly every point you raise, your hypothetical Libertarian (who I understand to be yourself) is entirely out of sync with the political identity.

            This leaves entirely aside my opinion on your personal political philosophy, your stated priors, or your conclusions; some of which I agree with and/or find rationally supportable, and others of which I don't agree with and/or don't find rationally supportable.
            ```

            - u/FlippantGod:
              ```
              It is hardly my fault if other Libertarians mistake minimizing the national government to its essential functions, with some vague concept of free market capitalism as a panacea to all our country's ills.

              Two liberal Democrats will not agree on everything (because a two party system does not reflect real people) and even on things they agree upon, they may have different reasons.

              Take two self proclaimed anarchists; one might run a local makerspace and drink cold brew coffee bartered for over Tor, and the other might protest police violence and the patriarchy. Is one not an anarchist?

              Edit: my point is, my view is not out of sync. My political views are fundamentally rooted in the same views as other Libertarians. I just strive to be rational and internally consistent in my policies, and some of my implementation details may be different.

              I know a common joke is a video of a Libertarian conference, in which a speaker is booed for insisting he prefer a drivers license. Anyone operating such a vehicle is a threat to the livelyhood of those around them, so it is consistent with the Libertarian ideology to want a drivers license to operate a vehicle in public spaces. The audience booing is not reflecting the actual Libertarian ideology. At the same time, I see no need for laws that require adults to wear seatbelts.

              Sorry, edit edit: my anarchist example isn't very useful as both can clearly be anarchists without conflicting. A conflict might be, is the makerspace actually anarchist? Because the owner has registered a company/org/etc, rather than set up in an abandoned parking lot. I think this makes more sense now? It both is and isn't anarchist.
              ```

              - u/PastafarianGames:
                ```
                It's not about fault; you're free to associate yourself with a political movement you disagree with, and you're only responsible for that movement inasmuch as you empower it. But inasmuch as "Libertarian" refers to a political movement in the United States, it's a minor offshoot of the Republican Party.

              I feel like that's you assuming a consensus where there really is none. It's like saying "You claim to be on the left, yet you are pro-gun. This is completely out of sync with the political identity." It is technically true, in that the stereotypical left-wing stance is against guns, but it also inherently dismisses all nuance and assumes that every single person that vaguely identifies with a political movement also strictly adheres to the characteristics of a strawman of that political movement.

    Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom by Cory Doctorow goes into some detail about its popularity based system of currency called Whuffie. 

    I don’t know that I would really recommend the book as worth the time investment except as a proof of concept because while the book does spend a lot of time and exposition on it I think the exploration as a whole is still a bit shallow. It doesn’t go into detail about how popularity is actually measured or how transfer of power is enforced, it just discusses some of the competitiveness and weird governing organizations and conflicts between them that form as a result of using the system.

          if it came out today I'd say it was some sort of a commentary on popularity and likes in social media? Or something? The MC could pose a great analogy for a social media influencer who suddenly sees the mob turn mean, for example. 

          But the story itself predates Facebook by like a year, and thus feels kinda unfocused and unsure about its premise to a modern reader. It was, in a sense, caught in the bow wave of future shock and is a rough read because of it.

            ```
            It was also his first novel and I think it shows. I agree it felt unfocused which is why I didn't really recommend it as worth the time. It tried to do a bunch of things like the consciousness backups and the currency thing and memory uploading as entertainment, yet none of it really clicked for me or had a lot of emotional impact. For example the part I spoilered could have been a great way to subvert the story and show the dark side of the system to add some realism, but instead it sort of gets brushed over in a few pages before the sort of happy ending.

            I would say it could be a reference to the social credit system in China or something like that but it predated that too.

        *Saturn's Children* I don't think has alt-economics, the main economics is some robots are enslaved and space travel is expensive.

        Its sequel, *Neptune's Brood*, has a lot of alt-economics (specifically the economics is most heavy in the last half of the book) (there aren't Saturn spoilers in Neptune since the solar system and characters are different). 

        Specifically, the premise is corporate space colonization. Different solar systems are run by different corporations, which don't trust each other, but still want to exchange intellectual property. 

        So while intrastellar trade is done using "fast money" (not specified if it's different from fiat), interstellar trade is done using "slow money", which is more complicated (specifically slow money is A) issued by each solar system and B) each uses third-party verification to try to avoid scams like double-spending and C) primarily to fund colonization but side benefit of reducing volatility, slow money is sovereign debt).

        Since slow money travels at a third of the speed of light (third party verification), there are complications, such as people looking to do scams and others looking to avoid scams (plenty of light-years distance means time for scammers to run away from victims). If you move from one system to another, you should exchange your fast money to slow money first (in the years of travel, extreme economic changes could happen).

        When you arrive in another solar system, others will be suspicious of you if you try to exchange a lot of slow money all at once: Are you running a scam?

        This isn't all of the economics in the book, the other economics would be spoilers I prefer not to type.

    Graydon Saunders's Commonweal series is my always-go-to for a fantasy take on this. (Warning: is written in Engineer, which is almost but not entirely unlike English. Contains a lot of canal-building.)

    Elizabeth Bear's White Space novels (Ancestral Night and Machine) have a quite divergent economic system which is pretty thoroughly explored.

  Someone recommended [**A Practical Guide to Sorcery**](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/34009/a-practical-guide-to-sorcery) last week. I started it yesterday and I'm hooked. I see that /u/AzaleaEllis sometimes also posts here and the story is definitely rational.

      Thanks for reading. I plan on reworking the first few chapters when book 1 is done or potentially sooner depending on how much free time I have. Those chapters are around 3 years old and just touched up, while most of the other writing is a complete redo. Now that the story is picking up, I should probably get on that sooner rather than later. Glad you found the story improved over time.

Not in the hey this is gonna suck way but in oh no, someone I like is about to give me work and I won't know how to say no way. Wow. Both Lance and Steven are giving me so much delightful ways of teasing them later.

      > "Would this happen to do with the Order you are forming?" While I told the Stones a bit about what I wanted of my life I don't think they quite believed me, scary pokémon or not. They saw me as a talented trainer but once I told my cousins and Steven about all the work I've already put into starting everything up? Steven took me a lot more seriously.

    Short stories:

    * [*There Is No Antimemetics Division*](http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/antimemetics-division-hub) (17k + 43k words) by Sam Hughes. You're probably already familiar with it, it's usually recommended in the same breath as *Cordyceps*. Strong recommendation.

     * The author also wrote [*cripes does anybody remember Google People*](https://qntm.org/person), which is a microfiction horror story done in an unusual format.

    * [*The Gig Economy*](https://zerohplovecraft.wordpress.com/2018/05/11/the-gig-economy-2/) (17k words) by Zero HP Lovecraft. Near-future cyberpunk cosmic horror. A mix of a ton of interesting concepts. Very good.

    * [*Technicolor*](https://pseudopod.org/2020/05/02/pseudopod-701-technicolor/) (13k words) by John Langan. Pretty similar to *Vampire Domestication*, I think: it's from the PoV of a student listening to a lecture on an... esoteric topic. To say more would be spoilers. Very good.

    * [*Coding Machines*](https://www.teamten.com/lawrence/writings/coding-machines/) (9k words) by Lawrence Kesteloot. Hard sci-fi/programming horror. Fairly well-executed, though perhaps not as unique conceptually as the other entries.

    * [*hollow hill archives*](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/hollow-hill-archives-teletubbies.69481/) (18k words) by indefinite. It's a sci-fi existenital/cosmic horror *Teletubbies* fanfiction. Yup. I wouldn't say it's particularly rational or hard, but it's weird, a horror, and generally groups well with the other entries on this list, I think.

    * [*Please Undo This Hurt*](https://www.tor.com/2015/09/16/please-undo-this-hurt-seth-dickinson/) (7k words) by Seth Dickinson. Depression/cosmic horror.

    ~~[*Blindsight*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48484.Blindsight) by Peter Watts arguably counts, as a hard sci-fi existential horror. That's a full-length book, 100k.~~ **Edit:** What am I talking about, you've linked Watts' lecture on vampire biology, surely you've read this.

    Regarding u/Paran014's recommendation... [*Katalepsis*](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/28023/katalepsis) *is* a very well-written dark urban fantasy with elements of cosmic horror, but it's more character-focused than plot- or horror-focused, and it's not "true" cosmic horror. I do suggest you give it a try, though.

    Movies:

    * [*The Cabin in the Woods*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1259521/). Worm : Superhero fiction :: The Cabin in the Woods : Horror fiction.

    * [*Resolution*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1977895/). Better to go in blind. >!A supernatural entity is trying to orchestrate a horror story in reality!<.

    * [*Pontypool*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1226681/). A group of people operating a basement radio station in a small town start receiving reports about worrying incidents during one of their broadcasts. Features the best example of a >!memetic threat!< I've seen outside of text-based fiction.

    I'll also mention [*The Magnus Archives*](https://rustyquill.com/the-magnus-archives/) (200 episodes, ~4500 minutes total), a horror podcast. It's centred around an institute researching supernatural activity. The protagonist is a newly-appointed archivist tasked with sorting out the poorly-structured mess of witness statements left behind by his predecessor. Starts as a collection of seemingly unrelated creepypastas which then connect into an overarching narrative. I'd argue it's rational-as-a-story, and there are rational side characters (including one character who is reminiscent of Marion from *the Antimemetics Division*, and if it were from her perspective it'd absolutely qualify for r/rational), but the leads aren't, really. The overarching plot is pretty good, though.

    I'm not sure if it completely fits the bill, but I really enjoy [Katalepsis](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/28023/katalepsis).

    It has body horror and lovecraftian elements involving worlds that mortals can't usually access inhabited by beings whose desires are incomprehensible but not usually good for anyone who wanders into them. It's also well-written and I like the characters.

    I haven’t finished it, and so far there aren’t really any markers of being rationalist adjacent, but I’d recommend House of Leaves. It’s a metatextual horror about a guy who finds a fictional critical analysis book about a movie, The Navidson Record, about a house. Most of the real-world narrative happens via footnotes, most short but some pages long. The layers of media are interesting, and it feels like a mystery. 

    Downside is you’ll most likely need to buy the physical book to read it. It does some funky things with formatting not possible in ebook formats. Some of it might be immersion breaking - I’ve only read one portion with weird formatting so far and it wasn’t, but I can imagine others might have higher standards than I do for that.

  - How to survive a summoning 101 by Durrendal: author's mother had cancer several years ago. This was my favourite rational-ish fiction at the time, and stays one of my favs to this delay despite being 31 chaps/ dropped on a cliff. The author really put in the effort to have consistent world and characters despite dealing with some heavy and dark topics. 


  - Game of Champions by Lamora: from what I understand, the author werent happy with the quality of this work / didn't want to write pokemon fanfics any more. They're still active and healthy though, and they post plot dumps from time to time.

      The Good Student was really powerful for me, how it mixes narrative and metanarrative to create a really cool dreamlike atmosphere.  It feels like tapped into some primal storytelling instinct that made it feel more like a myth or legend than just a story.  It's one of the first stories I think of when I try to make the argument that Web Fiction can stand up to the ephemeral 'literary merit' that published books have.

      Book 2, seemed to comparatively drop off a cliff.  Like somebody trying to make a sequel to an arthouse movie.  
      2002: Space Odyssey Harder.

      I'll still wholly recommend the first book, but just suggest people stop there.  The first book does wrap things up.

    The writing is a little inconsistent, but the MC acts really intelligently in cases where most MCs would not, and I like the interactions of real life situations, like living in a shelter after a disaster, with the RPG system. I also like the interface munchkinry, like turning up the gamma to see in the dark and using free roam camera to scry.

    I also quite enjoy Break Them All, which is not dead only in some notional sense. If the author updates at the current rate, the story will be done sometime around 2070.

      Paragamer is complete. The author is not planning to continue it at the moment, however. It ends anticlimactically, which sucked.

      I really enjoyed the banal reality aspect of it. The fact that the characters took up smoking to deal with stress, for example. The grinding being interrupted by the foster family's demands on the MC's time. Comparatively, the later arcs really needed a big payoff to be worth it, and they did not get that.

  [The Wizard Tournament](https://www.patreon.com/posts/wizard-humans-40620112) is spectacular:

  * The characters went from 2D to deep, complex people. I noticed myself pattern matching who people were based off a few snippets in the story, but later developments added context which showed I was wrong.
  * Several moments literally made me stop reading to laugh
  * A person's unique magic specializations is employed in clever ways to win (though not all magic is pre-defined for us to predict it, though there is a lot of extra world-building material listed in the index)
  * Clever social manipulation

  There are a couple things that I was against, a Shrek reference and the protagonist is initially unlikable in a Zorian-esque way, but worse!, and it's only on Patreon as far as I can tell (though you can read up to Ch. 100 or so w/o paying atm)

  If you're looking for something mildly entertaining to read, and can tolerate turning off 60% of your brain, people here might enjoy My House of Horrors. It's a Chinese translation in the emerging genre of "RPG system applied to thing you wouldn't anticipate. In this case, the main character is the proprietor of a down-and-out haunted house, and can improve it by completing missions that loosely fit in the horror genre.

  [My House of Horrors](https://novelfull.com/index.php/my-house-of-horrors.html?page=1&per-page=50)

  What's interesting about this (enless, millions of words) translation is the sheer number of hooks and subplots that are deployed as the story goes on. I'd say, first, that the main story loop is this:

  1. MC has a pressing issue, such as a powerful ghost is living in the mirrors in his house and trying to kill him / visitors / workers.  
  2. The MC feels like doing a tough horror mission will give him a power up to deal with the issue. The MC does the mission, which takes many chapters, and succeeds by the skin of his teeth.
  3. The MC deals with the original issue, either as a corollary of the horror mission or by using whatever power-up he got. The MC unlocks a new scenario in his haunted house that matches the theme of the horror mission.  
  4. For some business-related reason, self-absorbed social media influencers / unscrupulous rivals / criminals visit his house with intent to discredit / copy / steal stuff. They get really, really scared. This takes a number of chapters.

  The interesting part here is how much genre stuff gets balanced.

  - RPG system. MC levels up his house and gets occasional personal skill boosts, plus haunted magic item type things.
  - Relatedly, the MC collects ghosts, which are almost like Pokemon or something.
  - The MC impresses people with creepy skills, like making mannequins or whatever.
  - The MC manages his business, hiring rubes from the countryside, convincing the park to lease him their abandoned parking lot, or whatever. He makes and spends money.
  - Horror missions. The MC goes into a traditional horror scenario, like ghost village or whatever, and has to survive. Maybe a civilian is drawn in and they get brought into the masquerade , for flavor. The MC hits ghosts with a magic hammer, or pokemons ghosts with ghosts, or whatever weird thing.
  - Overarching mystery plot to find missing parents, the house missions are the only lead.
  - Social media influencer drama. The MC livestreams horror missions (of course), collects followers. People can't believe how amazing the special effects are.
  - The MC face slaps people who think his house isn't scary. The house has real ghosts, it's very scary. You shouldn't underestimate how scary this house is, random face-slapped NPC.
  - The MC (kind of) parents an orphaned kid. Also a cat, which does not behave realistically.
  - The MC solves murders and develops an (implausible) relationship with the police, who respect his hammer-toting ghost methods.
  - The MC has a kind of love affair with a ghost.
  - The MC confronts a secret occult society focused on ancient evil, a la Lovecraft.

  Though the story is fundamentally pretty stupid, it's stupid in such a meta and genre-evolved way that I can't help but be engaged.

  tl;dr If you want to read millions of words about a guy who levels up a haunted house and hits ghosts with a hammer, this is the story for you.
  ```

  - u/BavarianBarbarian_:
    ```
    Is there a convincing reason for why he doesn't just... leave the house? I suppose the idea that it could eventually lead him to his parents could serve, but is that supported by anything?
    ```

    - u/Amonwilde:
      ```
      He's not trapped in the house, it's his business and he's the proprietor. Horror missions take place outside the house, mostly. His motivation for not getting a job doing fast food or whatever and skipping the plot, besides making pretty good money with a popular haunted house, is initially to find his parents. After a while, he's pretty deep in, since he has enemies, and the house is the major source of his power. It'd say that part of the plot is pretty solid, it's everything else that's way out there. The most irrational things are his interactions with police and his livestreaming of actual ghosts, though there's certainly plenty of other questionable plot points.

  I am starved for 2 specific ploy archetypes and desperate for any obscure recommendations which fit I may have missed (assume I've read all the highly reced things + first 5 pages of score sorted on RR)

  1. Any Isekai with an intelligent, in-control MC;

  Other than all the standard good stories, I've found a lot of obscure ones which fit this criteria in all the worm crosses; anyone crossing with worm or with "My Youth Romantic Comedy Is Wrong, As I Expected" where they get Taylor or the other MC to be Isekai'd fits this since the appeal of those characters is competence, and all crosses are usually them going somewhere and kicking ass. If you have any other recs like this, please share!

  2. Any Isekai where the MC is isekaied into something which is normally not sentient/moral **and there is interaction with the native humans.**

  It would have to be really obscure cos I've looked far and wide for any more of these and feel like I've read it all now. But also please do rec if you have any! Some of my fav obscure ones which fit this is the couple of Pokémon Isekais (which are not PMD) which fit this such as a backwards grin and "I thought this was a PMD Isekai". 

  Thanks in advance!

    The most popular of this type you might be aware of is Lord of Mysteries. However, I like the author's previous work  a lot more.

        LoTM is really good. I know hearing you need to read a bajillion chapters before it gets good is annoying but this is one of the cases where I believe it's worth it. Volume 3 is what most people find to be the best volume but IMO the later chapters are even better.

        If you find it really hard to read, just skim the first two volumes but read the weekly Tarot Club properly. It asks as a kind of in-world summary of the week. It's worth skimming rather than reading because the many foreshadowing and to understand character motivation.

    Surprisingly a controversial pick every time I rec this one here, but I’d recommend the Japanese light novel series So I’m a Spider, So What? I’d even say it fits into both categories.

    The MC is surprisingly competent, although she can be silly most of the times due to her personality. The fights are pretty interesting and well-thought out, relying on the specialties of spiders to overcome stronger opponents. Some people do complain that there are problems and she doesn’t optimize everything to 200%, especially since she obtains and then relies on a skill that essentially gives her the best magic talent and abilities in the world, I don’t find it too egregious, and even then I still consider it better than every single litrpg on RoyalRoad other than Delve in terms of System stuff.

    And in terms of the actual isekai setting, plot, and System, it’s my all time favorite, even if it’s not as hardcore math-y as Delve.

    What I really appreciate about it is that it takes the classical isekai story you see in anime and novels, and actually puts thought into it. There’s a reason behind the System and it’s particulars, why the reincarnation is a thing, even all the fantasy elements and typical plot moments. 

    There’s a moment when the MC complains that she didn’t get a title or improved skill after maxing out two particularly annoying skills, and a mysterious Administrator D creates a new skill and gives it to her. This freaks her out as she realizes that this means someone has been watching her this entire time and created a skill for her, which means they can basically govern the System that affects the entire world, and wouldn’t that make them a God? She’s been deluding herself the entire time too, thinking it’s just like a game or like another typical isekai story, and realizes that stats and skills are unnatural. 

    Another group of reincarnations also find out that every skill, or at least every skill they know of, is explicitly used for combat, and ponder the sinister implications of that.

    I really appreciate Spider for how it approaches the typical isekai story and how it interweaves the System into the overarching plot, by far my favorite isekai and litrpg just for that. It’s not just a numbers go up story, and I felt that shift is a part of what makes it so good. The MC is your typical antisocial gamer, but she’s actually well-written, competent, and fun to follow and watch. She fails at communicating and interacting with others, but it’s actually fun and reasonable to see, instead of say, Rain spouting some Captain Planet references or meming. Her growth and drive is shown very well throughout the series, as she desperately fights for her life and kills and eats humans without remorse and essentially tortures herself to grind up skills and resistances to survive. This even plays into how she interacts, or fails to interact, with others and her views of normality.

    Of course, don’t go in expecting some crazy amounts of rationalism like in Worm or Worth the Candle, as it’s a Japanese light novel series, but it is surprisingly well-written and competent, and does some very interesting things with isekai and litrpg that I don’t see in any other series. And it’s definitely THE best monster isekai or even just monster MC novel out there, given that it’s closest competitors are like what, Chrysalis and ELLC and Slime?

    As it’s a light novel series, you’ll have to purchase the volumes, and they can be quite pricey at around 10 dollars per volume, if you’re not looking for “illegitimate” sources, which can be a turn off for some. I will say it’s very worth it though, although my views might be different from others since I enjoy reading a lot of web novels, even if the quality or translation isn’t the best. It also has a currently airing anime, even if the animation isn’t the best and it cuts out a lot of the details and nuance that makes the series so special.

      Already read the translation ages ago and started up again when it continued recently. 

      One of the best translated Isekais IMO but that isn't really saying much. Usually I don't like "group isekais" as well, but since this one mostly focuses on shiro I enjoyed it.

        There's a manga of it too! I'm enjoying the MC's problem solving strategies.

        There is an anime as well, but the anime doesn't explain the reasons behind the character's decisions, which takes away from the rational aspect.

    ```
    A bit out of left field, but [Agents of Light](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13049548/1/Agents-of-Light) is a Yugioh GX fanfic where three people isekai'd into the anime world by the Big Bad of the series. Instead of being heroes, they were forced to accomplish a task which would ultimately cause the destruction of the universe so that they can return to their world, and each of the three have differing level of willingness which causes them into conflict with each other. The duels are great and despite the protagonists using a much more advanced deck, sometimes even the side characters can pose a credible threat, but it's also really fun to see our protagonists bamboozle the anime casts with modern summonings that doesn't exist yet.

    Have you tried World of Prime yet? Published novels, Sword of the Bright Lady is the first one. I thought the MC was quite rational, actually wants to reunite with wife and moves toward that goal instead of just dropping a line or two about wanting to go back every few dozen chapers as per usual. Thought the writing was good, too.
    ```

    - u/Dragfie:
      ```
      Angst about wanting to go back usually turns me off, but maybe ill have a look. Thanks!

      - u/Amonwilde:
        ```
        That's it, it's not really angst if it's a legitimate goal with steps.

    Mushoku tensei becomes this more and more as it goes on.  It starts off slice-of-life; later, it ends up with the MC >!as the subordinate of a time-looper, in a desperate bid to protect his friends and family from a prescient godlike being.  There's speculation that he and another isekai'ed character were brought in by entities in the future as a retroactive weapon.!<

  Not a rec, but a question. I see "So I'm a Spider, so what?" mentioned here surprisingly often. I read through the first two novels, and liked it. (Spoilers below.)

  >!But it seems like the character is eventually going to be the new demon lord, and what I've read up so far, not particularly someone who's even mildly good on the good-evil spectrum. Does this get resolved in a satisfactory manner? is there a reason that MC has to do the things she does? or is it more grey and grey morality?!<
  ```

  - u/jiffyjuff:
    ```
    I haven't read the novels, so my knowledge of what you're talking about is second-hand via spoilers, but AFAIK >!there is a reason she does the things she does; her ultimate goal is a greater good. I don't know what exactly she's trying to fight/prevent, though.!<

  What are some ratfics for Elfen Lied?

  I'm surprised I haven't seen more discussion about this franchise on /r/rational. It's relatively well-known, has all the elements of a world that could be reinterpreted rationally. 

  Despite the good things I heard about it, I was disappointed by the sheer amount of plot-induced stupidity and shallow explorations of its themes. I did think the premise was interesting, and I wasn't put off by the grimdark aspects, just that the grimdark was poorly executed.

    en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Contact_(novelette) is a classic. 

    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Source_of_Magic  second of the Xanth novels, needs a fuckton of disclaimers about the author, game theory limited to a single (but important) scene near the end. 

    Eliezer has a written a couple of course. 

    Charles stross has some, A Colder War or Missile Gap. 

    Superscience and Fast Romance, game theory has a small but rather important role in the 2nd and 3rd book. 

    Does anyone know if there's a trope name for game theory? TVtrope pages can be a great source but I can't find a dedicated page.
