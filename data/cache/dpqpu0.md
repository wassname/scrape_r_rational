## Short pre-story for "The Sword of Good"?

### Post:

This is probably not the best place to post this, but I figure this is where the most people would have read Eliezer Yudkowsky's The Sword of Good.

I'm an English teacher now (can't change the username, but chemistry is my major! :P) and I was wanting to use a (slightly) cleaned up version of The Sword of Good for my classroom.

TL;DR, no spoilers, it's a sort of parody of isekai / light novels. A guy gets teleported to this fantasy world, told he's a prince with a destiny, with a prophecy and everything. Everything is cliche to the absolute max.

Then, surprise! It turns out it's Eliezer Yudkowsky writing it :P

I was hoping to set up my students' expectations by having them read something similar to what The Sword of Good is parodying. My problem is that every example I can think of is far, far too long to use in an English class.

Does anyone have any ideas?

(Also, slightly tangential to the topic, if anyone has any specific suggestions on things I might do in class to introduce students to rational writing / big moral questions / etc, that'd be awesome, too.)

Edit: From the comments, looks like my first thought of having another story first to set up a contrast was unnecessary. I'll play it straight. Though, I'll try to see if I can establish some understanding of tropes and parody before we start it.

  Don't bother with a story to set up expectations. The Sword of Good already does this for you with the first half of itself. It's pretty blatant too, with names like sword of good, prophecy of destiny, bad races, spell of infinite doom, and so on.

    True. I was thinking that it'd come across as a parody of those things, since my own experience made it feel that way. I wanted them to have that comparative experience, but you're probably right - it isn't necessary.

    Sometimes, my extensive reading does cause some challenges :P It's hard to make myself understand what something would look like to someone who hasn't read so many things.

    I appreciate your comment.

  So you want a completely forgettable isekai / epic fantasy short story for your students to read before having them read a 9k-word story that spends a good part of its length masquerading as the former?

  Even if you found something that matches your criteria (unlikely to exist *and* be remembered), that sounds like a bad idea:

  - You will likely lessen the enjoyment of *The Sword of Good* for (some of) your students, because such a juxtaposition can function as a spoiler.
  - After a bland first story, your students are more likely to just skip through the second one.

  It is likely your students have watched at least *Lord of the Rings*, *Harry Potter* and some isekai anime and whatnot and are sufficiently familiar with the relevant tropes.

  If you think this is not the case, you could watch *Stardust* together in class or something. You know, something actually interesting.

  *EDIT:* *Stardust* is actually too long (whether as a book or a movie) to consume in a lesson or two. So maybe not that.

    That's a good point, thank you.

    My concern is that I'm pretty sure very few of them have voluntarily read anything similar. Movies, I guess those examples work well enough, too. 

    It wouldn't have to be immediately afterwards, either - I've got them until June. I could do a simpler story now, and the The Sword of Good in April or May.

    I was more hoping to find a way to introduce them to the tropes without being a spoiler. The Sword of Good comes across as a parody at first, anyway, what with the silly names and such.

    I may want to just jump into The Sword of Good later on, then, after they've gotten a little better at seeing depth in stories.

    Thank you.

      The movie *Pan* (2015) plays a lot of fantasy tropes straight. Kung-Fu Panda also works with the whole "Chosen One" thing, too...
      ```

  Slightly off topic, [Body Ritual among the Nacirema](https://msu.edu/~jdowell/miner.html) is a classic example of playing with words to build contrary expectations.
  ```

    It took me until "holy mouth men" to get the joke. I burst out laughing!

    For anyone who still don't get the joke, try spelling Nacirema backwards.

  I don't think there are any short isekai's that 'play it straight' so to speak.  Short stories tend to have twist endings, so a straightforward adventure would be an odd fit for them.  Your students have probably already got experience with vanilla isekai's though.  I doubt you need a prequel.

  A fantasy movie would work best for this. Something like _The Wizard of Oz_ (1939) or _The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe_ (2005).
  ```

  - u/Teacher_Of_Science:
    ```
    Possibly. I've already eaten up time with the movie Freedom Writers. I'm not sure I could reasonably squeeze in another one. I'll consider it, though, thank you.
