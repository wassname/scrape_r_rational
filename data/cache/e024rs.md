## Rattle Fiction Podcast Episode 15 Cedric’s Eight (Part One of Two)

### Post:

[Cedric’s Eight](https://vi-fi.github.io/Cedric's%20Eight.html) is a great piece of HPMOR fanfic. It's a rollicking casino heist story, with a competent protagonist challenging a competent evil Vegas magnate.

And now you can listen to it!

[Episode 15](https://soundcloud.com/rattle-fiction-pod/episode-15-cedrics-eight-part-one) of the Rattle Fiction Podcast is live. It's a reading of the first half of u/vi_fi's (13,000 word) story originally posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/d6jek0/rtcff_cedrics_eight_13k_words/) inspired by an r/rational Secret Krampus prompt. The story is split up into two longish episodes, the second will post next week.

I publish on Friday mornings and I'm only posting a notice here every two or three episodes now, so subscribe if you don't want to skip a week.

If you do listen, take a moment to rate, leave a review, send me an email ([podcast@rattlefiction.com](mailto:podcast@rattlefiction.com)) or reply to this thread. It’s motivating to know people are listening.
