  She’s going to entitle Sve isn’t she? *Fuck*

  (That or kill Sve and feed her to Ivah, then entitle him)
  ```

    ```
    Wonder what his title would be, something like count ( duke, baron) of the devouering night/ eternal midnight
    ```

      I think she can only grant titles that seem thematically 'lesser' than hers, and she's of Moonless Nights. Devouring Night/Eternal Midnight seem a bit 'more' than that.

      So maybe something to do with twilight or fleeting shadow?
      ```

      - u/HeWhoBringsDust:
        ```
        Duke of the Long Dark? Baron of Dark Shadows? Count of Hungering Dark?
        ```

        - u/Mingablo:
          ```
          Earl of the summoning dark.
          ```

      - u/Nimelennar:
        ```
        How about the [polar night](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_night)?
        ```

- u/wren42:
  ```
  Question, do you write this fast or are you working through a backlog?  I've been seeing 2-3 posts a week recently, which is really impressive.
  ```

  - u/Ardvarkeating101:
    ```
    3 times a week ever since he hit the patreon goal
    ```

- u/Flashbunny:
  ```
  Ah, so the Sve is a Drider. Neat.

  ...Wait, do Drow turn into Driders when they have enough Night? Is that what being Mighty is?
  ```
