## [BST] The Magic of Oathkeeping

### Post:

National Novel Writing Month is in two weeks, and I'm trying to make sure I have a solid foundation before I start writing.

1. Using a simple ritual, you can make an Oath. Anyone can do this, though it's usually done as a declaration in a public space.
2. You can't fake making an Oath (*Edit: The Oath-making is accompanied by a display of lights that's impossible to duplicate.*).
2. You can't accidentally make an Oath.
3. You can make as many Oaths as you'd like.
4. An Oath can be either negative ("I will not ...") or positive ("I will ...").
5. Oaths are mediated by your internal mental state. The Oath is only kept insofar as you believe that you have kept it.
6. If you believe, ~~even for the briefest moment,~~ that you have broken your Oath, it is broken. Even if you're "wrong" about having broken your Oath.
7. When an Oath breaks, all other Oaths you've made break as well.
8. If your Oaths break, you can make new ones, or even remake the old ones.
9. Oaths give **benefits**. The basic benefits are strength, speed, and durability, but there are others as well, and they vary from person to person in ways that are unrelated to the nature and number of the Oath, and which can't be predicted.
10. The benefits get stronger with time, but start out very weak (it would be highly atypical for even the strongest Oath to have any effect earlier than a year).
11. The benefits get stronger with the *Edit: gross, not net* desire to break the Oath. If you have no desire whatsoever to break the Oath, you gain no benefit from it.
12. The benefits get stronger with the *ability* to break the Oath. Making an Oath ~~not to speak and then ripping out your tongue results in far, far weaker benefits than being able to speak and choosing not to~~ to never use your right hand and then cutting your right hand off would have no benefit.
13. The benefits of an Oath are cumulative with all other Oaths a person has made (so there is a point to making multiple Oaths).
14. Breaking an Oath immediately loses you all of the benefits.
15. *Edit: Once granted, benefits are never lost, except by breaking Oaths. Power increases or stagnates, but never decreases.*
16. *Edit: If multiple Oaths cover the same thing, you only receive the benefit once. For example, if you made an Oath to not eat grains and another Oath not to eat bread, you would gain nothing from making the second Oath. Duplicate Oaths have no effect.*
17. *Edit: You cannot gain a benefit from an Oath you do not remember, but any benefits already gained from a forgotten Oath stay in place.*
18. *Edit: The increase of benefit over time is not linear - it is very mildly exponential. Keeping an Oath for ten years gives more benefit than keeping ten Oaths for one year each.*

I believe those are the rules that I currently have in place. Because it's internally mediated, I believe that it resists *most* attempts at munchkinism - but one person isn't terribly good at probing a system for weakness. The specific benefits aren't *that* important, and they tend to be pretty weak unless you make some major Oaths and keep them for decades. Here's what I have so far:

* Get yourself addicted to some kind of drug, then make an Oath to abstain from it. The more addictive the drug, the more powerful the Oath.
* If you can double-think hard enough, you can break your Oath without actually breaking your Oath - but I have to think that this is on the level of making yourself believe that 2+2=5. Harder because you're not allowed to slip.
* If someone already has some benefit from oathkeeping, you can use it as a lie detector of sort. Test their benefit (make them sprint some distance, for example), force them to make an Oath not to lie to you, ask them whatever questions you'd like, then test their benefit again to make sure that they kept that Oath. This works because breaking one Oath breaks all others as well.

Anything else you'd try doing with this? Any obvious flaws? Any ways in which it possibly exceeds the intent of "betray one part of your utility function in order to gain some benefit and in theory fulfill other parts of your utility function"? Anything that needs clarification?

Edit: Thanks to everyone who commented for helping me work some of this stuff out. It's quite helpful.

  Not sure whether this is munchkinism or working as intended. But this setup creates a very strong incentive for people to trade portions of their utility function. 

  Example: Alice takes an oath not to personally work to benefit Cause A (which she supports). Bob takes an oath not to personally work to benefit cause B (which he supports). Alice and Bob then agree (but don't take oaths) to work to benefit causes B and A, respectively. Now both A and B are benefited, and Alice and Bob both benefit personally because of the oaths themselves. Assuming Alice values A roughly as much as Bob values B, this is stable against betrayal: if Bob stops working to support A, Alice stops working to support B.

  This example generalizes in many ways. A few examples:

  - People agree to take care of each other's children (and swear not to take care of their own). Scale this up to an entire village/town/etc. providing childcare in this way.

  - There's an incentive to solve large problems via specialization. E.g. if a town has two doctors, it makes sense for one to commit to taking care of men and one to commit to taking care of women (i.e. one swears not to take care of women, the other not to take care of men, respectively) as long as the benefits of the oaths outweigh the lost efficiency from forgone coordination. This scales even better when things are non-binary (I only take care of people ages 20-30, i.e. I swear not to take care of people from 0-10 and 10-20 and 30-40 and ...) or when multiple binary divisions apply (I take care of male children, i.e. I swear not to take care of women or adults). (EDIT: It's possible that your edit 17 applies here, but it definitely doesn't work as per your example. Bread is a subset of grains, but these categories overlap without being contained in each other.)

    This would work.

    I'm less certain that having doctors specialize by gender (or age) would, since it depends on what they want. If they just "want to help people" it wouldn't work, since they're satisfying that desire. However, if you had a doctor that wanted to work on women and a doctor that wanted to work on men, they could swap and get some power from it.

  Social-fu and deception is now incredibly powerful.  If you can make your enemies believe that they have broken an Oath, you have removed a good deal of their power.

  Is there any point to making Oaths like "I will spend 1 year and 1 day, starting now, in contemplation on top of this mountain." or would the short duration preclude any benefits?

  If forgetting about an Oath an effective way of never thinking that you have broken it?

  As your desire/ability to break an Oath goes down, does the benefit decrease, or just stop growing?

  For meta-gaming Oaths, a kingdom could get very powerful, quite quickly with this.  First, restrict Oath making to serious, low risk, high reward situations to prevent people from losing power.  Next, have every citizen swear an Oath to follow the laws of the land (or the Natural laws of humanity, or whatever), and have the military swear an Oath to follow the lawful orders of their commanders.  Ideally, this would solve lawlessness, desertion, and insubordination.

    Generally speaking, there wouldn't be a point - but it's possible that you could bind a tight enough Oath that it might actually have an effect in so short a time. Say, closing yourself into a small box, subsisting on only token food, minimal water, blinding yourself, etc., with the ability to stop and give in with only the smallest motion. (The year rule is just a lower bound - there's no watershed.)

    > Is forgetting about an Oath an effective way of never thinking that you have broken it?

    I'm kind of on the fence about that. Needs more thought.

    > As your desire/ability to break an Oath goes down, does the benefit decrease, or just stop growing?

    It just stops growing. Edited the OP to clarify that.

    > For meta-gaming Oaths, a kingdom could get very powerful, quite quickly with this. First, restrict Oath making to serious, low risk, high reward situations to prevent people from losing power. Next, have every citizen swear an Oath to follow the laws of the land (or the Natural laws of humanity, or whatever), and have the military swear an Oath to follow the lawful orders of their commanders. Ideally, this would solve lawlessness, desertion, and insubordination.

    You only get a benefit if you actively want to break the Oath, which means that lawful people wouldn't gain any benefit, which also means that there'd be no way to test between those who have broken the Oath and those who had no desire to do so. You would have to engineer another Oath that gives people some benefit, which means forcing them to do (or not do) something that they don't want to, which seems like a good way to start a revolution.

      Hmm, how are you measuring "desire"?  It it gross (in a financial sense) desire?  Could you make an oath to not punch annoying people in the face, not follow through on your intrusive thoughts, not chew your fingernails, and/or other things like that?  If those Oaths would work well, it would be a relatively painless source of power.

      Or is it net desire, and the Oath has to be the actual deciding factor in your choice, which may make drug addiction a questionably effective tactic.
      ```

      - u/alexanderwales:
        ```
        It's gross desire - so you can make an Oath for something that you find abhorrent but still want to do.

      The kingdom could do a "follow the laws" oath at birth and arrest anyone who lost the benefits, but it looks like you covered that a bit under lie detector. Still, it would be unwieldy but it would be a great way to fight corruption or if organized very strictly could make a police state very effective. 

      For a police state. Measure strength. Make subject take an oath not to lie to you. Have them tell you they are and have been loyal to the glorious leader over the past X number of years. Measure strength again. Execute the disloyal subjects. 

      Light side version. Judge makes oath to never accept bribes. Before every session of trial, show he still has the benefit of his oath.

  ```
  Everyone should swear an oath to live.  I don't see any downside, and on the upside, anything that doesn't kill you literally makes you stronger.  This oath would be especially potent for those who develop suicidal tendencies, leading to a somewhat unusual superhero demographic.

  If there is a reliable way to memory charm (hypnosis?), rule 18 allows oaths to be "taken back" while still retaining benefits, making the decision to swear an oath still high-tension, but ultimately reversible.

  Speaking of taking back oaths, most (if not all) oaths should have temporary escape clauses: "I swear to do X except during the time periods after I think 'disable oath X' ten times in a row and before I think 're-enable oath X' ten times in a row".  Even if you plan on never breaking the oaths, there might be a case where you just have to make an exception, additional power be damned.

  We might be able to munchkin using humans' irrational utility functions:

  1. Our animal brains disproportionately stress out about low probability events.  One might swear an oath that causes such stress knowing rationally that such occasions are unlikely.  For example, oaths to: 
      * Not look under the bed for inhuman monsters
      * Not resist attackers under certain conditions (the downside being that anyone who discovered those conditions would be able to attack you)
      * Never look up when crossing a street
      * "I swear that I will never accept Pascal's wager/mugging." 
      * "I swear I will refrain from eating bacon for a decade if this billion side dice lands on 22". 

      Of course, the stress is real, so this isn't a costless endeavor. 

  2. "I swear I will make the rational choices in any [Allais Paradox bets](http://lesswrong.com/lw/mz/zut_allais/) (which seems to bother people so much that, even understanding the paradox, they still want to defend the irrational choice) of which I am aware."  Proceed to have friends engage with such bets, and be bothered by it every time.

  3. Take advantage of [hyperbolic discounting](http://www.moneycactus.com/hyperbolic-discounting/): "I swear I will exercise tomorrow as long as the morning coffee is worth it."  The effort of exercising seems worth the coffee now, so as far as you're currently concerned, this commits you to exercising tomorrow.  In reality, once tomorrow comes, the effort of exercising will no longer be worth it.

  Additional munchkin ideas:

  1. Open-ended oaths: "I swear I will do X eventually." 

  2. Oaths open to interpretation:
      * "I swear I will be open-minded"
      * "I swear I will do anything within reason concerning X"

      counting on our abilities to rationalize our choices.
  ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    You can certainly make "no downside" oaths, and many people do, but the benefits are usually negligible enough that there's not much of a point. And yes, someone with suicidal tendencies would be able to leverage that for some benefit.

    There is a form of mental magic, but it's very difficult and very imperfect. But if you could find a sufficiently skilled mentalist, and wanted to consent to having her poke around in your mindscape, she might be able to remove the memory of the oath and make your existing benefits permanent.

    You can definitely hack oathkeeping by exploiting irrationality. The Oaths work better if they're big and powerful, but you could make little Oaths about trivial-but-still-stressful things and gain *some* power. The key here is that you would want to stay irrational so that there's still that desire there.

  "Get yourself addicted to some kind of drug, then make an Oath to abstain from it. The more addictive the drug, the more powerful the Oath."

  How does this interact with points 11 and 12? Effects start off weak (as per 11), reach some sort of peak, and then taper off as the addiction fades (as per 12)? Or does the growth over time beat out the weakening from the decreased addiction?
  ```

          ```
          Alchoholics keep going primarily to support people who are just starting down their road.

          Don't get me wrong, the addiction never FULLY goes away. Some of them need the support, some need the community. But there isn't a noticable difference between a year clean and 5, except maybe one of confidence.

- u/embrodski:
  ```
  >force them to make an Oath not to lie to you, ask them whatever questions you'd like, then test their benefit again to make sure that they kept that Oath

  This makes having an Oath a major weakness. By forcing an Oath, someone can permanently threaten to take away your superpowers which took years of denied desire to cultivate, unless you swear slave-like obedience to them. Blackmail ain't got nuttin on this. Either society would have to make "forcing an Oath" as illegal and strongly prosecuted as kidnapping someone's children, or else very few people will ever take Oaths. Only A) those who can hide it, or B) those who are already very powerful and thus not in significant danger of being forced to make Oaths they don't want to make.
  ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    That's true. I am mostly thinking that social conventions are in place to prevent Oaths from being forced - there exist major institutions which are dedicated to oathkeeping, and which have a considerable amount of power (and work to prevent external abuses against oathkeepers). But yes, it is something of a liability if you are public about it and there are people in a position of extreme power who can use force against you (though if you're in that position already, you've got other problems). 

    And you could also just give up your accumulated power to break the "slave obedience" oath, so there'd be strong pressure on your "captor" to not push you too hard.

      There's a simple countermeasure to such blackmail. Swear an oath to never swear oaths without some secret condition, such as "I will always touch my left thumb and left ring finger together when swearing new oaths."

      It does raise the mechanic question of when rule 8/9 actually triggers in such a circumstance. If I swear to never make oath x, and then make oath x, will the breaking of the first oath unmake the second, or does the breaking "game tick" take place before the binding "game tick"?
      ```

      - u/Gurkenglas:
        ```
        If you don't use this countermeasure this and they "force" you to make an oath via "Either you make an oath that takes away your ability to lie to us or we torture you for an hour and then ask you again", you either oath the equivalent of "1=0" or you break at some point and comply. If you use this countermeasure, in the same situation you either again relinquish your oath benefits or you comply and insert your secret condition. Therefore, that countermeasure is useless.
        ```

        - u/Prezombie:
          ```
          Yes, I get that. The point is, if you make an oath which breaks if you to make an oath under duress, the hostage taker loses that point of leverage against you. If they can't get your oath without breaking your oath streak, you have no incentive to keep the new oath streak.
          ```

          - u/Gurkenglas:
            ```
            It would be in your own best interest under duress to bypass any countermeasures you set up and can bypass. If you set up a countermeasure like "I will not make any oath under duress.", that amounts to choosing to oath "1=0" once you are under duress.

            Edit: You might be about to question why they would capture you for duressing if you made that countermeasure public. Their reason would be a TDT-like incentive for you to not make such countermeasures: If you precommit to take the lossy way out of a torture session, you'll have to actually follow through on that.

        Except you can't fake swearing an oath, because of the associated visual display. So, you don't do the X required by the blackmail, and your best friend/wife/whatever is tortured to death as was threatened.

  What happens if you *fulfill* an oath? I.e. "I will kill so and so" or "on the 9th of November 2015 I will donate half of my money to whichever charity gets the most upvotes"?

  Also, using the same examples, how do the benefits work on oaths that you are waiting for in some way. Like, "Once a year I will cut off one of my fingers". Does this give any benefits between the cutting dates? What about before you cut off your first finger?

    > What happens if you fulfill an oath? I.e. "I will kill so and so" or "on the 9th of November 2015 I will donate half of my money to whichever charity gets the most upvotes"?

    These tend to be fairly weak, though it depends on how much you don't want to do the thing you've made an Oath to do, and how much time you spend meditating on it. Generally speaking, it wouldn't be worth the effort unless you were psyching yourself up about doing something relatively painless. For example, if you had a fear of water and made an Oath to swim the Juniper Sea a year from now, you might get a little out of it, with the only real cost being psychological. An Oath that is fulfilled can't be broken, which is one of the major benefits of doing it that way.

    > Also, using the same examples, how do the benefits work on oaths that you are waiting for in some way. Like, "Once a year I will cut off one of my fingers". Does this give any benefits between the cutting dates? What about before you cut off your first finger?

    This would give you *some* benefit prior to cutting off the first finger, but it would be so minor as to be nearly undetectable, even if you spent a half hour every day meditating on how much you loved your finger and how much it was going to hurt to have it cut off.

    So in theory, you could make an open-ended "I will do *x* eventually" Oath where *x* is some extremely negative thing, and obtain some small power from it until the point where you decide not to do that thing.
    ```

    - u/Bowbreaker:
      ```
      Would it give any kind of spike in power each time you cut off a finger? Or would the tiny amount of time it takes mean the benefit for that moment is negligible? Same question for fulfillable oaths upon the moment of fulfillment I guess.
      ```

      - u/alexanderwales:
        ```
        In theory, the day (or even hour) before you're about to cut off your finger is the moment when you most strongly don't want to go through with cutting off your finger, so yes, there would be a small boost then if that were the case. But for time or event limited Oaths, the limits you place aren't really the point of the Oath - it's the desire that gets you the power, not the follow-through.
        ```

- u/WarningInsanityBelow:
  ```
  Rule 6 is interesting in that something similar to Löb's theorem happens:

  Oaths are broken only if you believe that they are broken. This means that if you interpret your oath in some particular way, you are indeed justified in this interpretation. This means that someone with sufficient dissociative ability to say one thing and mean another could appear to be making one oath and in fact be making another allowing them to bypass the lie detector test.

- u/Charlie___:
  ```
  Suppose we have someone who wants to be either a firefighter or a soldier. If they swear an oath against being a soldier, then they will gain benefits to being a firefighter. So as a matter of policy, people should be encouraged to strongly desire to do multiple things with their life, then swear an oath to do just one.

    Yep. This is what I meant about specialization in my comment above.

      ```

      - u/alexanderwales:
        ```
        It's possible - you're essentially trading a bit of your happiness for a bit of power. And it is somewhat common among the oathkeepers to enhance their desires in various ways. For example, if you've taken the Chastity Oath you might go to a brothel every week or so and lay naked next to a beautiful woman in order to increase the temptation to break the Oath (or better, find a woman who's made the same Oath and lay with her for mutual benefit).

  Unless the benefits are something other than strength, speed, and durability, this power isn't actually that useful, with all these downsides.

  Especially with 

  >This works because breaking one Oath breaks all others as well.

  That. 

  You just kidnap their children and force them to make and break an oath to let them live. Repeat with literally anything else they have. If they rely on their powers, you are much better off not using oaths at all, but in paying people a lot to serve you who DO take oaths, one of which is 'unless you intend to betray me' except lawyered to the maximum.

  I suspect you would get standard form oaths for employment and such after a time, but with one oath breaking breaking all others, and it taking literally years to fix, this is not actually that useful. Anyone who gets too far ahead of the pack will be brought back down by concerted effort - strength speed and endurance are not hackable enough to give you an unassailable position, especially when they are available to everyone.
  ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    I'm not sure that I like this objection. It's like saying that having a gun is useless because someone can steal your children and force you to give up your gun. There are relatively few weapons where this isn't the case, and I think it makes a better argument for keeping your loved ones safe than for not taking and keeping an Oath. Oaths are perhaps slower and more "expensive" than guns, but I think you're pretty much screwed anyway if someone has the means and motive to kidnap your children. Or perhaps you're saying that losing your Oath makes it harder to retaliate when you have your children back (assuming that your enemy didn't just kill them once he got what he wanted)?
    ```

    - u/JackStargazer:
      ```
      I've made a similar argument against concealed carry. It is *situationally* useful, yes, but on a grand scale it doesn't actually protect you in the situations you theoretically used to justify its existence. To use that example, having a hidden gun doesn't help you deal with someone who is robbing you and has a drawn weapon pointed directly at you in any real life situation. The only possible use would be to shoot the person as they flee with your things, which does not fall under self defense and would be murder.

      > Or perhaps you're saying that losing your Oath makes it harder to retaliate when you have your children back (assuming that your enemy didn't just kill them once he got what he wanted)?

      Something like that. The thing is, assuming you survive, it is very easy to get a new gun. Getting a new oath to the same strength level might be literally impossible in the time you have left - break an oath that has been gathering for thirty years, you are over 50. 

      If you relied on oath power to get into a position of high political or other social power you are actually *inherently weaker* than a person who got into a similar or even lower position without using oaths directly. 

      For a better example, think of a politician who got into a position of power by performing one evil act which they must hide, because if it got out it would destroy them. While it is not evil persay, power through an oath is similar except *everyone knows you have a secret and in most cases even knows what it is and how to use it to harm you*. 

      You have contingent power and the fact that you have it, and that most oaths are public knowledge means that you aren't just leaving the source of your power around where anyone can find it, you are Achilles living in an empire of heel-seeking arrows.

      Anyone who steps too far out of line, who uses oath power to gain temporal power merely because they are stronger/faster/ more enduring than others would be taken down by someone who is smarter, or more cunning, or more ruthless or any combination of all three. 

      And the way oaths *work* ensures this is much easier than recovering from it is, meaning it will happen pretty much universally to anyone with actually intelligent enemies.

      Kings would be people with powerful oath-using knights, who do not rely on oaths themselves. The strongest oath users would likely be 70+ year old monks, who neither have nor look for temporal power, and thus haven't attracted intelligent enemies.
      ```

      - u/alexanderwales:
        ```
        I guess I agree with most of that.

        > Kings would be people with powerful oath-using knights, who do not rely on oaths themselves. The strongest oath users would likely be 70+ year old monks, who neither have nor look for temporal power, and thus haven't attracted intelligent enemies.

        Actually, this is a pretty accurate description of the world that's been built for the novel. I think I just took a more optimistic approach to getting there.

        - u/JackStargazer:
          ```
          Well, it's still an interesting concept. It's great worldbuilding, but I'm struggling to see how you could write an informed protagonist character in it which used the rules of the world to tell a novel story without giving him a nonstandard oath power or similar. 

          Because aside from people occasionally having mildly superhuman bodyguards, and kung fu monks actually being a real thing, it seems like this wouldn't actually change the structure of society overmuch.

            Oh, the oathkeepers aren't the protagonists - they're the antagonists (more or less). Battle nuns and the king's superhuman huntsman are obstacles the hero has to fight his way through with cunning in order to achieve social change, using some of the flaws inherent in oathkeeping.

              Eh, you do realize that the oaths are utterly broken as political tools. 
              Any society of this kind ought to have older members with oaths of honesty of long standing. Never mind the direct benefits - if you are in a profession where trust is an asset, the ability to repeat the oath of non-deceptiveness and then demonstrate that you still have those benefits is ridiculously valuable. To the extent that I don't think you can stay in business as, for example, a trader, if you can't do this. Not if there are competitors who can. 
              That creates a societal class which is implicitly trusted and incorruptible (Because becoming corrupted costs you your livelyhood nigh-instantly) 
               I don't see how you can possibly remain a ruler for very long without belonging to that class. The only people who would remain loyal to you in any conflict are those oath bound to do so. 
              Reciprocal oath bounds would be stable, but starting a revolt against someone oath-bound to be the best ruler he or she can manage would be.. difficult. Because revolution requires distrust of the government.
              ```

              - u/alexanderwales:
                ```
                I think there are a number of ways that societies could arrange themselves, given the existence of such a magic system, and a lot of it varies with what the precise benefits are and how long it takes to accumulate them.

                If it takes a year with heavy, restrictive Oaths to show any power at all (let's say, a five-percent increase in strength and speed), and five years until an outside observer would be able to measure it (in other words, to get to the point where an outside observer could be sure that the person isn't just strong, but supernaturally strong), then I think it would be much more rare as a political or commercial tool. A hypothetical trader that's spent five years under heavy restrictions might be able to sell his wares for a bit cheaper because of the lower risk associated with doing business with him, but he would in theory have to charge more to make up for the fact that he's incurred a real cost by denying himself something for so long.

                It's also sort of funny that you'd argue that kings would have to have long-standing oaths, since other people in this thread are arguing that kings would have to *not* take any oaths, because this would be equivalent to exposing their Achilles heel and giving someone a way to strike easily strike at them. Or the other people, arguing that the possibility of blackmail, drugging, or even intense debate would be enough that oathkeeping is nigh worthless.

                Mostly I think you could make the argument either way. I can picture a society with two classes of people - the trusted oathkeepers and the oathless, with the oathkeepers having almost all the power and carefully wording the multiple oaths that they make every day. But I can also imagine a society where only a few people take oaths as a quasi-religious ordeal, and don't really operate on another level. Or another, where the oathkeepers are the underclass by virtue of the fact that they can be bossed around and can be kept on a chain by their oaths so long as no one pushes them too far. And all those societies could even exist under the same rules, maybe even next to each other.

  For drugs, you could have a vow not to do a specific drug (caffeine, say) for more than 30 days in a row.  Then do the drug heavily to build up addiction and tolerance for it the rest of the time, so the single "off" day really sucks.

  One way to use it for communities would be to have every member make a standard "Good Person" oath at regular intervals.  They wouldn't be guaranteed never to break it, but breaking it would reduce their ability to make and keep other oaths.  Even if they aren't serious oathkeepers, it would represent a trivial inconvenience, and people who refuse to oathkeep for very long at a time would be under suspicion of being not so good people.

  This would render most oaths useless. Transient thoughts are common, people will likely think they broke their oath randomly. Maybe make it require people believe it is more likely than not that they've broken the oath, and require a relatively complete mental state, not a transient thought.

  The way I'd game it.

  Train toddlers to be strong willed. Get them to make oaths e.g. "I will not eat sugary foods." "I will not buy goods" Have watchers for them, perhaps with oaths, to physically stop them while dangling sugar or goods in front of them.

  Or get the toddlers extremely drunk, make them make numerous potent oaths e.g. 'I will not walk or say zaasasauuooooosasa' 'I will not eat or say zaasasauuooooosasa' 'I will not drink anything except alcohol or say zaasasauuooooosasa' 'I will not lust after men or women or say zaasasauuooooosasa'.

  When they wake up they will have forgotten their oath. Inform them of the second part of their oath so they have some desire to break their oath. Regularly give them the ability to violate their oath.

  From an informational standpoint, this need a LOT of explaining. Does that mean that everyone can interrogate the current oaths and their wordings from everyone at all times? Everyone they can see? Are they in a book that is somehow mystically unhackable?

  Does this mean you can't fake it, as in "Psych! Not really an oath!" even though you did and said everything "correctly"?

  Do drunk people witnessing an oath become sober enough to judge its validity? Do the blind or deaf get an "oath sense" to tell it was done right? Is it impossible to brainwash someone into thinking they saw an oath take place?

  You already suggest testing people's oath abilities, so this doesn't seem to be the case. I don't think you can simply declare this without lots of explanation, especially if it drives plot.

    People declare in public mostly for social reasons. It's the same reason that people declare that they're going on a diet, or declare that they've stopped smoking. The social pressure when everyone knows that you've made a promise helps you to keep that promise you've made to yourself (or because you're proud of doing this thing). Making an Oath has more in common with swearing in a politician or granting someone citizenship than it does with buying a car.

  Is there a minimum age for oaths?

  In such a society there are many factions (sports,military,etc) which would have huge incentives to take children as young as possible and put them in "monasteries" where they make all kinds of oaths, which makes them super-specialized and effective. In addition brain-washing is probably applied so they stay in their (forced) careers. Ever increasing oath-boosting, like the drug addiction you mentioned, is most certainly applied until the point where too many kids die.

  Even for kids not in a monastery, there is immense pressure. As a non-oath boy you cannot really compete (for jobs,girls,grades,etc) against other kids with benefits. Even loving parents should encourage their children to make some oaths very early.

    There's no minimum age. And yes, it's part of the world-building that monasteries exist which take in young children (the Foresworn Sisters for women and the High Rectory for men) and ~~make~~ encourage them to swear Oaths. Though since someone who doesn't want to be an oathkeeper can simply break their Oath, the high pressure aspect of it doesn't work as well as it might. Think of the virginity pledges and anti-drug pledges that kids in the real world sign today, and how often those are broken - it would be less with some concrete benefit, but I have to imagine that a lot of the kids would just wash out, especially because for an oath to have any power it has to actually restrict you in some way that's meaningful to you.

  What if the desire changes? E.g. I have a crush on Alice, but I make the oath not to talk to her, which is very hard right now. A month later I am deeply in love with Beccy and do not care about Alice anymore.

  Vice versa, what if desire grows over time?

  I guess, benefit strength ~= desire * time since oath.

  That might enable another boost, if I can increase my desire. For example, taking hormones or drugs? Might be exploited temporarily for a short-term boost.

  **edit**: Wait, by (16) I cannot lose benefit strength if desire fades. After a quick desire spike and getting large benefits, it will probably stagnate for a long time. Finding the right drug means we could mostly ignore the time constraint.

  1. Make an oath.
  2. Take desire drug, which boosts benefits to 90% of what you will ever get.
  3. Drug effect fades, but benefits stay.

  The tricky part is to maintain the oath, while under drug influence. Under lab conditions this should be possible. Making the drug fade faster is a worthy research goal.

  However, the internal mediation might be resistant to any drugs? We cannot be sure, though. At least, some crackpot researchers will claim to find such drugs. There could be a whole industry about (useless) benefit boosting, just like our fitness and weight-loss industries.

    It originally started with the monasteries, where they were making oaths for other (religious) reasons without the expectation of benefits.

  Considering the number of oaths people see you will see people getting drunk, etc, very very little because it's just not worth the risk. As well if you are saying that oaths cannot decrease then you can spend some of your time doing very high risky stuff, when you're in a really good mood and think you'll be able to not do it, like I don't know, and the rest of the time it'll not increase since you're miles away from it but you can just keep it going higher and higher.

  The extreme use cases are not the interesting ones, the thing you have to consider is how *everyone* would attempt to use it, and the social implications over time. 

  Everyone has aspirations, plans and long term goals, great and small, many of which are such that you do not anticipate deviating from them ever being a good idea. So making oaths about such things is a freebie. These are temptations you are going to be fighting anyway? Make it an oath. 

  So standard oaths would be things like fidelity, faithfully executing an office, studying diligently.. 

  Not extreme or complicated wows, but formal and public commitments to the basic norms of a community. Which will have social effects - I guarantee that almost everyone will be extremely reluctant to make any wow which hasn't stood up to the test of "most people manage to keep this one", because an unblemished record in this regard is going to be the definition of being a respectable citizen. 

  There would quickly arise standard formulations for the most common ones, which would be carefully worded to avoid both the possibility of sabotage causing you to violate them, and to render void the possibility of playing games with them (to boost the power gain) 

  Thus, a standard oath of honesty would not be to speak the truth - that's 
  just begging some smartass to fuck with it, but simply 

  "I will not speak with the intent to deceive or mislead".

   That preserves your ability to tell stories - that are clearly stories - keeps the option of keeping your gob shut under duress, but forces honesty, so it is a significant wow.  

  And in a relatively short time you end up with all positions of authority being filled with people who have kept wows like that one and other obvious markers of good citizenship for a span long enough to have easily verifiable effects.

  So basically if as a child you take the oath to not have sex until you're 18 or something you'd become really powerful, especially towards puberty right? And if you didn't break oaths the power would be kept even after X years had passed. I suppose that'd be a frequent oath.

  Also...how about a bisexual, so equally attracted to both sexes, although that can fluctuate, making an oath not to have sex with one of the sexes? I suppose you're going to say it'll be weaker than a heterosexual and/or homosexual taking the same oath for their prefered gender. But how about a bisexual taking a full chasity oath? It'll be stronger than that of a heterosexual or homosexual right?

  How about we combine the two previous suggestions? A bisexual taking a full chasity oath for X amount of years? How strong would that be? Compared to the same by people attracted by one gender?


  I'll suppose this is a very frequent type of oath.

    The strength of the oath depends on the desire, so being bisexual wouldn't have much effect on total power gained from a chastity oath unless being bisexual was associated with an increase in total sexual desire (and I have no idea whether that's the case - intuitively, I would think not).

    But yes, it's fairly common to take oaths like that. But just because you don't have any power to show for it doesn't mean that you broke your oath, since it might *also* mean that you just never had that desire in the first place (if, for example, you're asexual).
