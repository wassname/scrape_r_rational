  Same Grade... marked him as his equal.

  - u/MadScientist14159:
    ```
    OH MY GOD, EY!
    ```

  - u/Lethalmud:
    ```
    He must have done it on purpose..
    ```

- u/None:
  ```
  You know, normally I really like troll-villains, but Lord Trolldemort here has murdered his own student and then *given her a bad grade for it*.  I think that firmly qualifies as being a complete asshole.

  Is Quirrellmort just supposed to be kicking the dog now?
  ```

  - u/nohat:
    ```
    It's a reasonable lesson. The grade isn't fair, but neither is life. The only thing you have to do to get an Acceptable is survive. It's Quirrel's version of heroic responsibility.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      It'd not reasonable at all.  *He killed her himself!*
      ```

      - u/Nevereatcars:
        ```
        Actually, we don't KNOW that he killed her. All we've observed was that a troll was let into Hogwarts and warded against sunlight and spells, both of which require that A wizard be involved; this wizard could be any character, even those suspected to not be wizards.
        ```

  - u/kaukamieli:
    ```
    I think I've read too much other fanfics... Are we sure Trolldermort killed Hermione? :)
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      Sure, as in, it's been confirmed in-text?  No.  But I'm pretty confident about this.
      ```

- u/Transfuturist:
  ```
  GET HYPE

  VALENTINE'S DAY PLUS ONE 2014 PLUS ONE
  ```

- u/libertarian_reddit:
  ```
  How the hell are all the little fiddly bits gonna get closed up in 17 chapters?
  Unless these chapters are really long...
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    According to [the author](http://hpmor.com/notes/), there are about 88k words in the remaining chapers. This is a full 11k more words than *The Philosopher's Stone.*
    ```

    - u/kaukamieli:
      ```
      Ohh yeaaaaaaa... Hope it can live up to the hype. :D
      ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Let's hope they are, because now that the end is in sight, I don't want it to come.
    ```

    - u/Arandur:
      ```
      I am going to be so sad.
      ```

- u/alexanderwales:
  ```
  Man, Quirrell is such a dick. "Hur hur, I docked her points for getting killed by a troll." Even if he hadn't been the one that used the troll to kill her, that's like failing someone out of driver's ed because they died after getting hit by a drunk driver. And Harry's apparently totally fine with that.
  ```

  - u/NotUnusualYet:
    ```
    He told her to leave Hogwarts and she didn't. Neville left and got an Outstanding, Hermione stayed and got a Troll.
    ```

    - u/gabbalis:
      ```
      Oh. I get it now. That *is* in poor taste.
      ```

    - u/Teive:
      ```
      No no no, she didn't get a troll.  She would have gotten the lowest grade [allegedly troll], but Quirrell said it would be in bad taste
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        She did get a Troll, though.
        ```

        - u/Rhamni:
          ```
          It followed me home, can I keep it?
          ```

  - u/buckykat:
    ```
    the lesson is for the remaining students. not even primarily for harry. life, and more especially battle magic, does not give As for effort.
    ```

    - u/alexanderwales:
      ```
      Literally everyone else in the class got (at least) an A for effort.
      ```

      - u/daydev:
        ```
        Maybe is actually was "A for Alive"?
        ```

      - u/buckykat:
        ```
        Everyone else got (at least) B for not getting themselves killed. That was the big test he was talking about.
        ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    I was surprised Harry wasn't fuming. That was honestly completely unnecessary, he could have made his point without being an asshole. Oh well, Voldemort wasn't known for being "a pretty nice guy."
    ```

    - u/scruiser:
      ```
      I think the whole thing with him on the verge of dying got him enough slack.  Without this I am pretty sure Harry would have called him on it.
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        Honestly, at this point I consider MoR!Harry halfway possessed.  He seems to have lost all ability to call Quirrell out on *anything*.
        ```

  - u/kaukamieli:
    ```
    Except that the course is about protecting yourself and killing threats. She wasn't able to do that, so she failed.
    ```

  - u/Nepene:
    ```
    At least he didn't give her the lowest grade.

    " Passing grades

        Outstanding [O] (always continues to N.E.W.T.-level)
        Exceeds Expectations [E] (usually continues to N.E.W.T.-level)
        Acceptable [A] (rarely continues to N.E.W.T.-level) 

    Failing grades

        Poor [P] (may repeat)
        Dreadful [D]
        Troll [T] "
    ```

- u/Iconochasm:
  ```
  Time for a re-read, or two.
  ```

- u/JackStargazer:
  ```
  Hmm. Interesting. I may need to reread, but what has Neville done to get an Outstanding?
  ```

  - u/clawclawbite:
    ```
    To quote Karate Kid "Best defense: don't be there".

    There are problems at Hogwarts, therefore to be safe, be someplace else.
    ```

- u/Esparno:
  ```
  OMG OMG I CANT WAIT TILL FEB 15TH.  It turns out that after months of being a hermit after my breakup I will finally get to play DnD with this woman my brother and his wife have been telling me about, AND HPMOR IS GOING TO UPDATE WITH THE NEW ARC.

  SO MUCH HYPE FOR THAT DAY!

  Everything's coming up Milhouse.
  ```

  - u/Nevereatcars:
    ```
    Was going to comment "Everything's coming up Esparno," then noticed your last line.
    ```

- u/Draconomial:
  ```
  STILL BEING WRITTEN!?!
  ```

  - u/Draconomial:
    ```
    Oh, not the chapter, the story.
    ```
