## Last Week

[Last time,](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3iiztn/weekly_challenge_dueling_time_travelers/?sort=confidence) the prompt was "Dueling Time Travelers". /u/anakiri is the winner with their story ["Timeship Operators"](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3iiztn/weekly_challenge_dueling_time_travelers/cuj0gak), and will receive a month of reddit gold along with super special winner flair. Congratulations /u/anakiri! (Now is a great time to go to that thread and look at the entries you may have missed, especially the late entrants; contest mode is now disabled.)

##### This Week

This week's challenge is "Dinosaurs". Genetically engineered creatures pulled from blood trapped within a mosquito and mixed with frog DNA? Rich men hunting for a trophy in the distant past? Throwback creatures on an island lost to time? We all know [everything is better with dinosaurs.](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingsBetterWithDinosaurs) Remember, prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

The winner will be decided **Wednesday, September 9th.** You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given a week in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

##### Rules

* 300 word minimum, no maximum. Post as a link to Google Docs, pastebin, Dropbox, etc. **This is mandatory.**

* No plagiarism, but you're welcome to recycle and revamp your own ideas you've used in the past.

* Think before you downvote.

* Winner will be determined by "best" sorting.

* Winner gets reddit gold, special winner flair, and bragging rights.

* All top-level replies to this thread should be submissions. Non-submissions (including questions, comments, etc.) belong in [the meta thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/39dxi3), and will be aggressively removed from here.

* Top-level replies must be a link to Google Docs, a PDF, your personal website, etc. It is suggested that you include a word count and a title when you're linking to somewhere else.

* In the interest of keeping the playing field level, please refrain from cross-posting to other places until after the winner has been decided.

* No idea what rational fiction is? [Read the wiki!](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index)

Also, if you want a quick index of past challenges, I've [posted them on the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/weeklychallenge).

##### Next Week

Next week's challenge is "Defied Prophecy". You know what? [Screw destiny!](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewDestiny) There's no fate but what we make and if prophecy says that something is impossible, we'll just have to go [beyond the impossible](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeyondTheImpossible).

**Next week's thread will go up on 9/9.** Please confine any questions or comments to [the meta thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/39dxi3). If you want to discuss the week's theme, feel free to [make a post about it](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/submit?selftext=true).

  I know this isn't standard faire but....can i request a re-roll of this week's challenge? Asking an honest question, as it seems there's little to no interest on this prompt. 

  P.S Feel free to delete this comment after you've read it, mod-sama.

    Eh, if there's no interest, we might just go a week without a winner. I don't want to reroll now when someone might be working on something. (I do have a theory that the small incentives provided by winning might spur someone to write *something* in order to claim the prize, but we'll see.) This one *was* taken from the prompt list.

    I'll nuke these comments if/when there's an entrant.

    Edit: Comment nuked.
