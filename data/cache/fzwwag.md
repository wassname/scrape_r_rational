  This is starting to remind me of the AI box challenge. In the back of my head, I know Turry is still a potentially murderous-or-worse unfeeling monster that could spell the end of humanity, but right now he just feels like a [Secret Magic Pet](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ABoyAndHisX) a la The Iron Giant or Toothless.

  The moral of those stories is always that the people who are scared of what the pet could do are totally wrong, paranoid, and misunderstanding its fundamentally good, kind personality. So Turry obviously pattern matches to that and should be embraced and allowed to do as he pleases, right?

    I think that the whole point (or one of them) of the Box conundrum is that it's impossible to tell the difference between a "Secret Magic Pet" AI and a sufficiently advanced "End of Humanity" AI *pretending* to be a Secret Magic Pet AI.

    Its clearly been unboxed for quite a while. That is not what the story is about. 

    I think it may be a story about her grandfather having done a very silly thing, and handed the mandate of heaven to a teenage girl. That is, its terminal value is her thriving.

      It may be built with some projection of Hayes' values.  He created an AI pet that would fulfill his basic values, and it just turns out she is a big part of that value system.

    The author seems to have done a good job of illustrating that human-like behavior can make it more creepy.\[1\] (It also might be amoral, it's not super clear if it would harm someone if asked. \[2\])

      I mean it locked that girl in the toilet then flooded it, not to mention the car crash. I'm pretty sure it would hurt someone.

        That's what I meant by \[2\]. Though it probably differentiates between harm and murder.

          The wake early in the story has me wondering.
