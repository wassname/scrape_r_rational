  I find it quite arbitrary that leveling up won't cure the bone condition. Though thinking about it, has a lvl up ever cured any magical condition ?

    I think the closest he's come is when he levelled up on entering Silmar City, which cured the rat rot. That probably doesn't count as magical, though.

    However, a level up did fully replace the parts of his fingers (including the bones) that were cut off by the thaum-seeker. Maybe he could solve his current problem by removing all of the drained bones prior to a level up?

      On the other hand, it's possible that the new bones he gets will still be drained.
      ```

        ```
        Cut off finger, drain finger bone, check what happens after level-up.
        ```

    Maybe if he hadn't gone to Kindly Bones, leveling up would have cured it. But he went there and put himself in position of having a new quest hook reminding the DM about it and giving him ideas.

    This will be explained in much detail later on.

    Iirc the only affliction that didn't go away was Cowardice. So that might imply magical + mental effects won't be cured.

    I am in Central Time Zone and usually post between midnight and 2 a.m. As the summary says though, the update schedule is basically "when I feel like it".
    ```

      That's UTC-6:00 for everybody who isn't from the default country.

      It's actually a 0 to 9 scale. A neat psychology trick is that people will answer 1 more readily than 0, even if they mean the same thing. Using a zero-based scale is useful if you want to coerce a certain answer. I believe Alfred Kinsey got flak for this because he used a 0-6 scale for heterosexual and homosexual preference.

      Yes. Fenn is having waayyyyyy to much fun with the gamifiction. 

      "Now flatter my tongue!". "Did that make my loyality go up?"

  My current hypothesis is that the character sheet is actually some kind of soul magic.

  There's haven't been any mention of soul mages. But since they are used for fuel and other stuff. I think if they exist it's week evidence that I'm right. If I'm right, encountering soul mages would be dangerous as they could probably spoof the loyalty points.
  ```

- u/Calsem:
  ```
  It's a bit worrying how nonchalant Joon is about killing people.  The world may be a game, but it is one where the lives at stake are very very real.  

  Fenn makes a good point in that regard: 

  > “Killing that gold mage is not our end goal. I know that’s probably the best path you to get another level up, and gods help us that might be necessary, but the thing we are actually trying to accomplish is getting Amaryllis back to us.”

  Though she assumes killing is necessary for leveling up - but is that true?  I would bet that Joon gets xp gain from winning diplomatic encounters as well.

  Man I love this update schedule.  Finished the entire story sunday and already have two more chapters to go through.

- u/Kuratius:

  After very careful consideration, and assuming no one is made to hold the idiot ball, the inevitable conclusion is that what the skin mage did is a retcon by the DM.

  The other option would be that the skin mage is holding the idiot ball for plot convenience, which makes this part of the fic non-rational.
  ```

    I think there's a very big difference between "this plan is stupid" and "this plan is so stupid that it would have required the equivalent of divine intervention". People make the reputation/money trade-off all the time, especially against unsuspecting customers, and I have to think that was even more true in a time when there was no internet and reputation was more purely word of mouth.

    His plan didn't even necessarily have to be "I'm going to extort you", it could have been "I am going to charge you for fixing this thing", which is what crooked car mechanics often do. The first thing that he did was say that he would have to look at the tattoo; he's badly off-script by the time he gets punched in the stomach, and I don't think he'd have to reveal that he fucked them, just that this is a problem only he can fix, mixed with a complex explanation about skin magic he could make up on the spot.

    At any rate, I think there's enough information to maybe conclude that the plan wasn't particularly smart, but I don't think it's so not smart that you have to say that this only happened because god did it.

      I like this explanation and have edited the chapter somewhat to incorporate it.

      That's the best valid argument from anyone here that actually makes sense for the context he's operating in. 

      There's still a risk that they would have forced him to fix it for free (he botched the work after all, so the plan is still not very smart), but in your case his scheme might actually have been sustainable.

    Can you explain how you came to this conclusion?
    ```

    - u/crusher_bob:
      ```
      Because the skin mage doesn't seem to have any defense against them walking in off the street, beating him up, and taking his stuff.  And given his actions, that's exactly the consequence he should have expected.
      ```

      - u/cthulhuraejepsen:
        ```
        The tattoo mage *did* have access to not-insignificant magic in his skin.

        If it helps, imagine it as a 5th level wizard trying to pull one over on what he thinks are probably commoners, only to have them come back and be *much* stronger than he had expected them to be, maybe a pair of 7th level characters, and found himself more scared by the prospect than he thought he would be.

        And once all that's going on, he has access to magic, but that magic is an escalation, and they've already revealed that *they* are strong, fast, and have magic items, plus they seem really willing to straight up kill him. So using the magic of his tattoos is actually not a great idea, because it's likely to result in a full-on battle in his shop, one that he no longer thinks that he would win, especially because they're acting really unconcerned about it.
        ```
