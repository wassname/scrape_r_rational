## [D] Monday General Rationality Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics!  Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world?  Have you:

* Seen something interesting on /r/science?
* Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
* Figured out how to become immortal?
* Constructed artificial general intelligence?
* Read a neat nonfiction book?
* Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?

  I've got a personal score card for myself.

  How much of modern technology could I jump start from a given era assuming the ability to communicate with the locals.

  I am pleased to say that I could probably shave off three hundred years from the 1600s now.

  Or in other words I know 'most' of the foundational experiments that go from phlogiston to atomic numbers.

  I need to work out how to build an X-ray tube and identify raw copper and zync ores still.

  But the rest is mostly just resources and getting some one who can  do book keeping on the findings.

    Maybe you can jumpstart /r/1632!

    The 1632 series is pretty rational, or should I say obsessively realistic?

      It *was* written by historians.

        And engineers.

    How would you feel about sharing what you've put together? I'm working on something similar but I'm nowhere near as far along as you seem to be.

      Let's see well one of the biggest discoveries for getting it started seems to actually be isolating and proving the existence of oxygen.

      Also the amount of weight that oxygen contributes to things that burn.

      So if you have a good source of oxygen from a process you can do a lot.

      Doing this requires some chemical combinations, one of the easier ones to do is burning 'calc of mercury' with sunlight and a lens. Calc of mercury is oxidized mercury and was common as an apothecary ingredient and thus fairly easy to acquire.

      Alternatively if you HAVE mercury you can just oxidize it to manufacture calc of mercury and thus assemble your experiment from there.

      After that proof isolating atoms via electrical processes is next, which you need a volt pile or battery at minimum. That takes copper, zinc, cardboard and salt water.

      You can use this to do things like isolate sodium and potassium from compounds that they are otherwise bonded too.

      Potassium and sodium make for great magic shows to wow audiences too.

      This gets you the basis for the electron as a component of atoms and electron based bonding of atoms to make molecules because the different poles of your circuits that are used to say split hydrogen and oxygen out of water will be drawn to positive and negative poles.

      After that things get a bit more complicated and much more labor intensive, pitch blend (the ore of uranium) is a common waste product of some silver mines. You can start demonstrating radioactivity with raw uranium ore using just photographic paper, to build the instruments to detect radiation with any precision though you need some experts in quartz crystals and piezoelectric however, radioactive isotopes WILL make air more conductive, so you can start working through how to build that stuff.

      Extracting radium from pitchblend is immensely intensive labor wise but might be good for a light show (kinda dangerous though).

      You need an X ray source and a particular kind of crystal that I don't know the properties of yet to get an X-ray spectrum of pure elements.

      This will give you an atom's position by atomic number and sidestep the complications of trying to figure out the periodic table by the more complicated and not quite intuitive atomic weight method that was actually used.

      I'm leaving off a lot of the individual element isolating experiments in favor of the more foundation/bigger picture proofs.

      I still want to shore up some of the knowledge bases here personally before I move onto figuring out how to do neutron detection/proof.

        Re: radium from pitchblend, here I think the most important thing to do is to leave this to capable but expendable assistants...
        ```

        - u/Nighzmarquls:
          ```
          To preserve my own ethics I'd warn any assistants or fellow philosophers around the world that performing these labors too consistently will shave years off their  lives but if they are still willing to go through with it I won't stop them.
          ```

    - u/Nighzmarquls:
      ```
      Oh there is also stuff like germ theory, blood type, vitamin c, genetics, the basics of a capacitor, electrical circuits, computer programming, steam engines and a few others but I don't think I can recreate most of those experiments and a lot of that knowledge is not necessarily as useful without getting the chemistry and material sciences up to snuff.

    Nice.

    Here's a thought: Say you or someone else pursues this hobby for an arbitrary amount of time and decides to write either 'The Beginner's Guide to Civilisation' or 'Self-Uplift for Dummies'; 

    What are the theoretical minimum requirements for a reader to be able to follow along and build a society on par with ours? 

    Would it be literacy in the language used? Fluency? Or would the ability to perceive and understand pictures be enough?

    High vacuum is a powerful tech to introduce for a lot of applications (x-rays, mass spectrometer, insulation for cryogenics, power electronics), so look into that. It is actually fairly simple to achieve with a [Sprengel pump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprengel_pump) using some glass tubing and liquid mercury.

    [Glassblowing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glassblowing) is going to be a big deal, so maybe start by hiring some competent glassblowers. Not only are you going to want it for things like test tubes and Sprengel pumps, but obviously there is the fact that glass has useful optical properties. If you can set up a [drawing tower](http://www.heathway.com/ctowers.htm) that works well enough, you could use fiber optics for communications (skip the copper cable telephone and go straight to the photophone); not to mention as a way to create lasers, when you are ready to get ambitious.

    For precision machining, you need flat surfaces and straight lines. There's a way to get flat surfaces by grinding three surfaces against each other. You can also get straight lines by grinding three rods together. Both of these are described [here](http://www.engineeringforchange.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/multimachine-concrete-lathe-ver-1-10.pdf), as well as a trick for using cast concrete (which shrinks when it sets) for precision machining (basically, you use cast concrete to make the general structure, then use nonshrinking grout to fix the ways in place).

    Speaking of bookkeeping; given that your strategy will probably involve gaining and managing a lot of wealth, [double-entry accounting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-entry_bookkeeping_system) is going to give you an advantage (assuming it isn't widespread in that era). You could potentially use it to make your vassals richer, especially if you had a system to enforce its use uniformly. You could also use a [land value tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_value_tax) to encourage people to build smaller and closer together while funding infrastructure and defense. Another thing might be to add a credit scoring system that incentivises repayments and thus permits the use of credit without there being things like debtor's prisons and slavery.

    I've thought about the same problem before now. High five from a fellow uplifter!

    > But the rest is mostly just resources and getting some one who can do book keeping on the findings.

    As an engineer I am understandably biased, but I've also had some extra details about what you need to actually create 1900's technology ground into my head. The physical making of stuff is more of a concern than you might think, there are a lot of hidden pitfalls that are not immediately obvious. 

    To get your score card up to full implementable uplift level, you'd need knowledge of the steel producing blast furnace, the Haber process, some simple metallurgy knowledge like how to make it so the iron/steel isn't super brittle, a basic understanding of making re-usable moulds to allow for mass production and replaceable/interchangable parts, and ideally the recipe for black powder and the basics of designing a steam engine to make the mining easier. You could probably pick that up in an afternoon or two. And then, you can become King of France!

  alexanderwales ripped the code from that worldbuilder CYOA a few days back and guided me through enough of it to let me start experimenting/learning how it worked. I started out knowing zero coding, and while I'm obviously not doing anything advanced, it feels really good to be able to take a functional piece of HTML and rework it with my own content. In a day or three I think I'll have finished making my own interactive CYOA, and I'll be sure to post it here. I'm also finding learning coding a lot of fun, so I think I'll hit up a general beginner's guide when I've finished the CYOA.

    Coding is super fun, and a lot more accessible than people make it out to be. At least, when you're working with material that's well annotated or you have the developer's ear, haha.

      I might do that, although since this is set in the world I'm writing about, most likely I'll just share it here and then spread it around more when I'm looking for beta readers.

  An AI is now at 2-0 against Lee Sedol, possibly the best human Go player in the world. 

  Even though Lee was in top form and played a game that commentators struggle to find flaws in. 

  [At one point](https://youtu.be/l-GsfyVCBu0?t=1h17m42s) in match 2, the AI played a move so mystifying that the pro commentator (high rank himself, able to predict a good many moves) was wondering about a misclick. (You can see him hesitating to put the stone on the display board.) 

  And then Lee stopped and thought about that one move for twenty minutes (with his 2 hours clock running!).

  And still lost. 

  This is what true superiority looks like. When you can’t even tell what you did wrong or your opponent did right.

  &nbsp;

  “Yesterday I was surprised, but today, more than that, I am quite speechless. I would have to say, if you look at the way the game was played, I admit that it was a very clear loss on my part. From the very beginning of the game, there was not a moment in time that I felt that I was leading the game. […] AlphaGo played a nearly perfect game.” 
  (Source: Lee's post-game interview, end of the above video)

  "Yeah, we could maybe have AlphaGo learn everything totally from scratch and reach a superhuman level of knowledge just by playing itself, not using any human games for training material. Of course, reinventing everything that humanity has figured out while playing Go for the last 2,500 years, that's going to take quite a bit of time. Like a few months or so." 
  (Source: Kaj Sotala's paraphrase of [this interview](http://www.theverge.com/2016/3/10/11192774/demis-hassabis-interview-alphago-google-deepmind-ai))

  Three more games to go; Lee is now saying he'll try hard to win one.

    I stayed up late last night watching this and read quite a bit of the commentary this morning. There are way too many Skynet jokes.

    I don't necessarily think that this is what true superiority looks like. The big issue is that AlphaGo is a complex trained neural net, which means that it's very hard to see why it's doing *anything*, even if it's making mistakes. This isn't necessarily a matter of mastery, it's a matter of pure inscrutability.

    To think of it another way, let's say that the game of chess was carried over the Aleutian land bridge (or whatever) and the native peoples of the Americas developed a strong culture of chess. When first contact happened, eventually a European would sit down to a game of chess with an Algonquin ... and they *both* would find themselves up against moves that they didn't know of and didn't have the context for, because the chess metagame would be similar but different. Since AlphaGo trains mostly by playing itself (IIRC) it has a different "understanding" of the game, and part of its advantage is that it's probably consumed all the games of baduk on record but no one has studied *it* enough to know its common lines of play. Given time, human players might be able to figure out why it's doing what it's doing and why, but that time doesn't exist and we don't have a catalog of games (we only have two games of the current best iteration of the program).

    I'm not saying that AlphaGo isn't better at the game than Lee Sedol (since I think it's pretty likely that it will take the series 5-0) but much of what it's doing hinges on "alieness" rather than "skill", if a neural net can be said to have such a thing.
    ```

    - u/Pluvialis:
      ```
      That's possible, but it's also possible that AlphaGo is vastly more capable than Lee, and I think that would look like this? It prioritises increasing its probability of victory and doesn't try to maximise its score, so you don't see 'overwhelming victories' where AlphaGo gets piles more points than Lee. If anything, wouldn't it tend towards 'marginal victories', because that means its putting all its resources into increasing its overall chances of winning?
      ```
