## [BST] Accidentally, without any preparation, you are sent 24 hours back in time. What are some clever ways to exploit this situation to benefit from it?

### Post:

Variation - you had 5 minutes to prepare.

More specific rules and mechanics(whether it's parallel timelines, or your consciousness is transported into your body, or there's a second version of you that can interact with you from the past) are up to you - whatever is more exploitable/interesting.

  You will be sent back in time in a little under 24 hours.  Here's what we've cumulatively learned over the last 271828 iterations...

  Two bodies is *much* more exploitable, even with no preparation.

  After you've gone back and realized what the hell's going on, plan carefully.  You will wait until the next big lotto drawing (hope this is a day of the week a big lotto is actually drawn on...use the biggest-payout one available, obviously, even if it's a "crappy" daily).  Make careful note of the numbers.  Now contrive to send these numbers back with the original you in some way you won't have noticed...while original-you is asleep, slip them between your gym and blockbuster cards in your wallet, or safety-pin them into the hem of the pants you're going to be wearing (ideally both, lest things devolve into a comic hunt for the hem-note that fell off and was caught by a gust of wind or something).  Code the numbers in some simple way so someone else who finds them will not have the actual winning numbers.

  Examine your plan for any obvious flaws, adjust as necessary.  Think about it for at least five minutes, but 30 would be considerably better.  Every time you find and patch a flaw, add five minutes.  Once you're confident, check your wallet (and/or your pants hem, etc).

  If you find numbers, go buy your ticket.  If you find mysterious bloodstains, you're probably screwed (given a fixed timeline, abandoning the plan at this point won't help, that blood's gonna come from *somewhere*), but don't give up...pick up some emergency medical supplies and soldier on.  Consider concealable body armor as well if your current finances permit.

  Assuming you did find numbers, when you get to the lotto place, you may be tempted to buy more than one identical ticket so if there are other winners you will get a bigger share.  Consider carefully how officials will react when you claim your winnings in that manner...do you want those questions asked?  Decide you want at least a small hedge against sharing.  Buy several camouflage tickets with one of the numbers increasing incrementally, then skip a number, then buy two of the winning ticket, then several more cover tickets increasing normally.  "I had a dream but I couldn't remember the last number exactly...weird fluke that I accidentally bought this ticket twice, eh, Lottery Commissioner?"

  When you catch up to "the present", you may be tempted to try to observe original-you at the moment original-you was transported back.  Consider whether this knowledge is worth the unknown risks of being present - take into account you are now wealthy and have "more to lose".  Even if you decide it's too risky, consider setting up video equipment in your stead...even a slim possibility of learning how to trigger the event again would be of extremely high value...

  At all times remain hyper-vigilant for the sound of your own voice.  Record it and play it back so you're sure you can recognize it.  Remind yourself to react instantly to any shouted warnings from yourself, as they will *probably* be in your best interest.  Try *not* to look around too much though, so as to leave hypothetical future-yous as much room as possible for stealthy assistance should additional loops somehow occur.  Do not allow the latter caution to result in you being hit by a car or something - be sensible, insofar as the context permits it.

    Pretend to be a slightly unhinged psychic. It came to you in a DREAM, you saw the RIVER of BEING and the DRAGON of KNOWLEDGE, and he SPOKE to you, and you were BLESSED by his PRESENCE!!!!1!!

    (This is why you bought 20 tickets with the same numbers.)

    Seeing as how there is zero evidence available to link you to any kind of scam or pre-knowledge of the numbers, the most they can do is get the cops to administer a drug test to you. You come up clean, and there's no actual rule against being bonkers.

      \*shrug\* It's not that they're likely to find a way to invalidate your claim, just that it's sensible to avoid additional scrutiny if you can (if there are reliable strategies for keeping lottery winnings private even in the face of media interest - "Officials report *21* winning tickets were sold for Thursday's Big Lotto draw" - it'd be a good idea to use them anyway).

      At the very least, you might create a bitter nemesis out of the other winner, who still has 1/21th of a lottery jackpot to work with.  :)

  With no preparation the question comes down to "What information did I learn and remember during the past day that I could exploit 24 hours ago?", which is almost entirely dependent on what happened in your life in that period (and perhaps how good your short-medium term memory is).

  With 5 minutes of preparation the most obvious answers would be lottery numbers (if a drawing in your jurisdiction occurred in the period in question), or failing that stocks that gained or lost a lot of value in that period.

  Alternately you could use the 5 minutes to gain information you wouldn't normally be able to get without unacceptable consequences.  You probably wouldn't be in a position to do anything like corporate espionage, but if you had something you wanted to ask or tell somebody but were afraid of their reaction, you could use that 5 minutes to call them on their cell phone (assuming they have one) as a test run.

  If you physically went back such that there were two copies of you that opens up some other possibilities.  You could establish an ironclad alibi if needed, or simply try to come up with an epic prank or magic trick that left everyone wondering if you had a secret twin.  If you're in a relationship you could even give your SO a special threesome :)

      After checking a list of today's biggest winners and losers on the stock market, which were only in the ballpark of ~20% changes, I agree.

      Going for a [trifecta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trifecta) would be a good way to go, especially if the winning horse had longer odds.  I don't know if any longer sports odds are regularly available.

  Well, I did just have a poor house inspection yesterday.  I'd turn the AC down ahead of time so it didn't have to struggle in the hot afternoon during the test.

  Reddit has long been a hot spot for conversation on the internet. About 57 million people visit the site every day to chat about topics as varied as makeup, video games and pointers for power washing driveways.

  In recent years, Reddit’s array of chats also have been a free teaching aid for companies like Google, OpenAI and Microsoft. Those companies are using Reddit’s conversations in the development of giant artificial intelligence systems that many in Silicon Valley think are on their way to becoming the tech industry’s next big thing.

  Now Reddit wants to be paid for it. The company said on Tuesday that it planned to begin charging companies for access to its application programming interface, or A.P.I., the method through which outside entities can download and process the social network’s vast selection of person-to-person conversations.

  “The Reddit corpus of data is really valuable,” Steve Huffman, founder and chief executive of Reddit, said in an interview. “But we don’t need to give all of that value to some of the largest companies in the world for free.”

  The move is one of the first significant examples of a social network’s charging for access to the conversations it hosts for the purpose of developing A.I. systems like ChatGPT, OpenAI’s popular program. Those new A.I. systems could one day lead to big businesses, but they aren’t likely to help companies like Reddit very much. In fact, they could be used to create competitors — automated duplicates to Reddit’s conversations.

  Reddit is also acting as it prepares for a possible initial public offering on Wall Street this year. The company, which was founded in 2005, makes most of its money through advertising and e-commerce transactions on its platform. Reddit said it was still ironing out the details of what it would charge for A.P.I. access and would announce prices in the coming weeks.

  Reddit’s conversation forums have become valuable commodities as large language models, or L.L.M.s, have become an essential part of creating new A.I. technology.

  L.L.M.s are essentially sophisticated algorithms developed by companies like Google and OpenAI, which is a close partner of Microsoft. To the algorithms, the Reddit conversations are data, and they are among the vast pool of material being fed into the L.L.M.s. to develop them.

  Um... I had a couple of donuts with my breakfast and watched some television shows, so I could have a mildly more productive and much healthier day. 

  Oh, and yesterday was pretty horrible, so yay, I get to do that one over and make *that* productive too!
