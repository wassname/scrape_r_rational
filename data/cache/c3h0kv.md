  omg, how was there a good hpmor fanfic that i didn't know about and haven't already read!? see, this is why people should still be posting updates to the reddit threads.

    Ha ha, well I'm glad you think the fic is good. :) I do wish there was a way to update the recommended thread on the HPMOR sub with the more recent stories. It's three years old now. :P

      PM the mods and/or start a top level post asking for the people to post their suggestions of what should be added?
