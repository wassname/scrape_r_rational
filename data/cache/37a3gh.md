## Are there any Rationalist Discworld fics?

### Post:

I've always thought that they would make for an interesting concept, but have yet to find one.

Do you guys know of any?

  Yes, Terry Pratchett wrote most of them.

    Yup.  I can't write rational!Worm, rational!Discworld, or rational!Vorkosigan because I can't add what is already there.

    Oh, come on, let's not make "rationalist" just another word for "fiction we like".  The Discworld doesn't even fall much into "rational" fiction, except in as far as "rational" overlaps with "having well-developed and believable characters and events".

    The books do not put emphasis on characters thinking things through and solving their problems that way; even when characters do do this, their thought process is only shown (if at all) for the sake of humour, not for the sake of showing good thinking technique.  The world admits very little scientific study, and bends itself this way and that to make the plot work; you're not going to have any luck with demystification or solving the story as a puzzle.

      I mostly agree but Discworld does tend to show characters exploiting the laws of their universe (e.g. narrativium and million-to-one chances) to their advantage. Yes, this is played for laughs but that's because the entire premise of Discworld is played for laughs.

      I haven't read all the Discworld books (yet), but the Tiffany Aching books definitely do it for the sake of showing good thinking technique.

        For most characters, I wouldn't count how they exploit the world rules as a sign of rationality, as it isn't done consistently.

        I've not read the Tiffany Aching books yet, looking forward to seeing that, then.

          Tiffany is certainly rational, although I feel Vetinari is more so.
          ```

          Tiffany goes around telling fairy creatures they're naturalistically impossible, in fewer words.  That's in her *first* appearance, before she has any *training*.
          ```

            Isn't that a bad thing? Sure fairy creatures are impossible according to our laws of physics and biology, but they are right there in front of her. therefore they must be possible. Unless you meant something slightly different with '**naturalistically** impossible'.
            ```

      Discworld is not LessWrongian rationalist.  It *is* fairly rational, as in, "many characters do roughly what you would think to do if you were in their position, and very few, if any, characters hold the Idiot Ball."
      ```

      - u/Rouninscholar:
        ```
        There are some idiots, but they are consistently idiots, no plot dumbing.
        ```

  - u/High_king_of_Numenor:
    ```
    Would they fall under rationalist though?

    They're satire, for the most part, not focused on the underlying rules of the setting. 

    The books are definitely *rational*, but rationalist is a whole different can of worms.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      Well, there are rationalist characters like Ponder Stibbons, and many characters, like Rincewind, Granny Weatherwax, and really everyone to some degree is aware of the rules of the universe, understands something of their nature, and bases their actions sensibly around those rules. At the same time, the rules of the universe defy demystification, or else they are already demystified: the world runs on narrative causality because people think it does. So what do you want to see explored or done?
      ```

      - u/High_king_of_Numenor:
        ```
        I was just wondering if there was any preexisting work done on it; if anyone had taken a crack at HPMOR-ing(?) the series.

        It would certainly be interesting.


        Stibbons does make for a great rationalist character, although he was never explored in depth. Rincewind was fun, but he's not exactly rational, just cynical and terrified, and Granny is one of the most thought provoking characters of the series, and that saying something, but does not attempt to deconstruct the underlying laws of that universe.

        It would be hard writing anything that would be as good or atmospheric as the novels were, but if it were accomplished, it would be very interesting to read.

          So, you're looking for more of a munchkin story taking place in the discworld settings? Because if you don't define what it is you're calling "rationalist" vs "rational", it's going to be very difficult for anyone to reasonably discuss the topic.

          A large majority of the characters in the series already feel like they are doing the best that they can given what they have access to.

          I suppose one potential story that might fit what you're looking for would be an explicit story detailing the "adventures" of Vetinari between the events of Night Watch and his actually becoming Patrician.

            I'm a complete newbie here, so I'm referring to the sidebar definitions.

            Munchkin-ing has a somewhat more negative connotation, but overall, I guess that could be what I'm looking for.

  Aside from [](/GNU Terry Pratchett)the man himself, [A A Pessimal](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1895209/A-A-Pessimal) has probably written the best Discworld text I've read, though it's been long enough that I don't remember how rational it all was.

    ```
    I'll check him out.

    Looks good.

  ```
  I only read the first book so far so i might be mistaken , but wouldn't being actively rationalist in that world be counterproductive?

  I mean I got the impression that world is significantly effected by thoughts and intentions, and trying to act "rationalist" would not be looked upon favorably by the universe.

  But, uh, what did you have in mind?
