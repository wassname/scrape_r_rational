    I thank you very much for recommending this to me. Weird, imaginative character designs, alien cities, strange worlds that are not meant to be fully understood by the reader and cryptic, Michael Kirkbride-style world-building are some of the things I enjoy most of all in fiction, and that make this story a giant superstimulus for me.

  *[GURPS](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps)*--the Generic Universal RolePlaying System--is an **unbelievably**-awesome system for tabletop roleplaying. What evidence can be cited in support of this claim? Here are some snippets from the introduction to [the *Basic Set*](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/Basic)...

  > *"Generic."* Some people like quick, fast-moving games, where the referee makes lots of decisions to keep things moving. Others want ultimate detail, with rules for every contingency. Most of us fall somewhere in between. *GURPS* starts with simple rules, and--especially in the combat system--builds up to as much *optional* detail as you like. But it's still the same game. You may all use it differently, but your campaigns will all be compatible.[...]

  > I'm satisfied that *GURPS* is is the most realistic, flexible, and "universal" system ever developed.

  Not yet convinced? Check out [this extensive list of bibliographies](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/biblios.html) for many books in the current and previous editions of *GURPS*! *GURPS* books incorporate such a *ridiculous* amount of research that they're delightful to read even if you never play a single game! Here's [a page](http://i.imgur.com/gJKUacH.png) from *[GURPS Low-Tech](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/low-tech)*--just one of *dozens* of such pages in that supplement!

  And, as the icing on the cake--all current-edition GURPS supplements (and many books from the previous edition as well) are [available](http://www.warehouse23.com) as *DRM-free,* easily-searchable PDF files! Nothing is ever out of print!

    Having worked and played with GURPS, I can say that in general (heh) I would NOT recommend it as a first RPG system to anyone. It's a different and refreshing breath of air to someone familiar with tabletop roleplay, but will be difficult and fiddly for new players. GURPS is probably the best system I've encountered from a simulationist perspective, and I've used elements of it in custom RPG systems I've made and quests I've run. That doesn't make it easy or fun for anyone not already very interested in tabletop RP. During actual play there can be some problems. It's the [Dwarf Fortress](http://i.imgur.com/B8327D0.png) of tabletop rpg systems, for better or for worse.
    ```

  - u/lvwolb:
    ```
    Having played GURPS for a couple years, I can second: It is a really nice system. After coming from GURPS, other systems tend to feel rather restrictive, especially with respect to character building.

    That beeing said, whether GURPS is a good fit for your game really depends on what you want to do:

    -Worldbuilding: Other systems tend to provide vast, lovingly crafted worlds. Gurps encourages GMs to engage in world-building themselves; this is hard.

    -Magic system: Frankly, I hate the default magic system of Gurps. In order to get a coherent state of affairs, the world-building and magic system need to be designed for each other.

    -Combat: In contrary to other posters, I don't think the combat system is overly complicated or cumbersome. It is, however, incredibly lethal, both at lower and higher tech-levels. So this is a matter of taste: Do you want "realism" or shiny, powerful fiction-like knights or space-marines? During each fight, a couple bad rolls can mean permadeath for your beloved character that you nursed for years. Does this extra tension make the game more fun for you, because you have to actually think and plan and avoid fights? Or do you rather want to relax with a couple friends over some beers? Both are totally valid answers, but your entire group should agree on this, and your choice of system should reflect this.

  Any good rational comedy you can recommend?

  I'd like to read some for inspiration for an idea I got. Problem is that I suck at writing comedy and it always ends up as gallows humor or black comedy no matter how lighthearted it starts.

  I'd like to know if there's some good non-cynical rational comedy you can recommend.

  [Choice of Alexandria](https://www.choiceofgames.com/alexandria/) - new interactive novel by the author of [Choice of Robots](https://www.choiceofgames.com/robots/). You play as ancient scholar in Alexandria. You can focus on pursuing studies, creating inventions, tutoring young ruler or manipulating your way to the throne.


  [The Grand Vizier of Oz](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4645725/1/The-Grand-Vizier-of-Oz) - Wicked fanfic where characters are slowly making social change, carfully learn magic and are resonable about relanshionships. Optimistic, but not unreasonably so. As author put it: *"I wondered what it would take for the characters of Wicked to actually achieve a real 'happily ever after' â€“ what work they'd have to do, what troubles they'd have to deal with, and what things would never work out no matter what. I wanted it to be canonically plausible, not a total fantasy with no sadness or negative consequences. I think I've managed."*


  [Shogun by James Clavell](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/402093.Sh_gun) - European ship crashes on a shore of feudal Japan. English navigator must survive in unknown land and Japanese must deal with political turmoil. Lots of ambitious characters thinking about their next move.

    > Shogun by James Clavell - European ship crashes on a shore of feudal Japan. English navigator must survive in unknown land and Japanese must deal with political turmoil. Lots of ambitious characters thinking about their next move. 

    Slight aside. I recall reading this book about... oh, a decade ago? I mentioned it to my mother (who as a rule doesn't care for most fantasy or historical fiction novels). She started talking about all sorts of things from the book. I was shocked.

    Turns out the book was made into a TV miniseries in the early 1980s, and she and her friends had tuned into it religiously. She still recalled it almost three decades later!

    Anyway, I seem to recall liking the book. Hopefully you're enjoying it too!

    I second Shogun- an incredible read, I've read it twice despite its massive lenght. World-building is top-notch and it will make you feel as if you've lived inside feudal Japan. One particularly memorable scene involves the mention of a duck.

  [Broken Crescent](http://www.sandrewswann.com/books/broken-crescent) by S. Andrew Swann.  Hard portal fantasy with one of the most developed magic-as-programming-language systems I've seen.  Level 1 intelligent characters, with factions differing in values rather than "good" vs "evil".  Good reasons for why the locals haven't exploited magic OR science as much as the protagonist.  Tough problems for the protagonist, including the need to learn the local language -- no miraculous translation spells here.  Protagonist enacts some level 2-ish solutions but they are pretty obvious if you're a programmer; in fairness, the main character is not supposed to be a genius in general, just a reformed black-hat hacker.

    I've just finished reading this at your recommendation. Overall I grade it at a C+. The author tried to do too much in a single novel, so he moved too quickly through the most interesting aspects of the story.

  ```
  [Lily of the Valley](https://ebihime.itch.io/lily) is an excellent, free visual novel by ebi-hime. It only has one choice near the end (it's fairly short). It's not rational, but it's an excellent depiction of depression. Summary: Returning home to Wales for the first time in ten years to attend his motherâ€™s funeral, a middle-aged man encounters a young girl he has never met before on a walk in the countryside. Although her face is often expressionless, her words harsh and cutting the man soon forges a friendship with her, of sorts, as he confides in her his worries. However, their every encounter leaves him with more questions. How did she know his departed mother? Why does she have such a morbid fascination with death? And why does she look so much like his childhood sweetheart?

  ***

  I also recommend that people here try out [Long Live the Queen](http://store.steampowered.com/app/251990/) if you haven't already. It's a visual novel with raising sim elements and lots of choices. Your goal is to survive as a 14-year-old princess until you're crowned queen. The game has a lot of branch points and it's fun replaying it to see the different ways of surviving are and slowly figuring out all the nobles' backstories and scheming.

  ***

  I'm not sure if I've recommended this here before, but [Wearing Robert's Crown](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11861559/1/Wearing-Robert-s-Crown) is probably my favorite Game of Thrones self insert fic, with the main character making many rational decisions in governing Westeros. It updates regularly, and unlike most Game of Thrones fics, is actually starting to approach the point where the White Walkers become relevant.

  Does anyone have recommendations for (preferably complete) television shows that are primarily about the workplace with some element of learning? I've been watching *Shirobako*, which seems to be largely about the professional environment and working relationships, and when I get to the end of it, I'd like more of that. *Atelier* was also like that, in that the relationships and characters were largely defined by work, in contrast to American sitcoms where work is just the forgettable backdrop for jokes or romance.

  No one really seems to talk about E.B.O.N.Y. (www.ebony.extra.hu) aside from a few forums. No discussion at all in Reddit, even. Well, this is an attempt to fix that.

  E.B.O.N.Y. ("The Weirdest Riddle Game On The Internet!") is a "riddle game" - a screen will give you the clues that you have to solve, and (generally) you put the answer directly in the URL to get to the next level. The riddles are pretty varied - some are a little straightforward if kinda lengthy to work out, but others require you to think "different" - they're exactly the kind of puzzles that makes no sense on a first look but then, when you actually know the answer, you think again and say "****, this was so obvious!" Some also reference other works/disciplines, so you might have an easier time on some levels if you, say, went through classical music training, or like to read mystery novels, or such.

  Riddle games were something of a fad around the time E.B.O.N.Y. first came out, I think, though as far as I know this one's the only one that has a story, the concept of which I found pretty compelling, which is what had me hooked all these years. That said, the overall story isn't actually done. The creator says it'll take about 200 levels, not including forks, to finish, and only recently did he update the game up to level ~75. And most of the story come from conversation with characters, where there tends to be an average of 10-15 levels between meeting a character. Half of me think that's the reason meeting a new character felt so engaging, though the other half wanted to bulldoze through them so I can meet a new character already.

  Hope some of you try it so I have someone to talk about it with.

  I can only recommend some fanfics I've read recently. I make no guarantees as to how good they are or their rational qualities. I will list them in reverse chronological order (the one I read most recently being the first). 

  * [Lesser evils](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10753296/1/Lesser-Evils) HP fic. Harry responds differently to Voldemort's resurrection and Cedric's death, which leads to him delving into his mental connection to Voldemort, resulting in consequences good and bad. The writing is largely in-character, the changes to canon believable and not at all overdone.

  * [The Black Prince](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11098283/1/The-Black-Prince) HP/ASoIaF Harry is born as Robert Baratheon's middle child, regaining his old memories and magic, but not his full personality. An interesting concept, adequately executed. The writing is reminiscent of ASoIaF, not HP. Left me wanting more.

  * [Life in Konoha's ANBU](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7977390/1/Life-in-Konoha-s-ANBU). Naruto has the Hokage's personal attention and training from an early age. He's still the same person in some ways, but in others the brainwashing/conditioning has palpable - and scary - results. One of the more enjoyable Naruto fics I've read. The characters are distinct and believable, even the OC's, the storylines interesting. Makes use of filler material, but it works out well.

  * [He who fights monsters](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6942921/1/He-Who-Fights-Monsters) Rosario + Vampire. Largely does away with the canon storyline (I believe - I never could get myself to watch it). Instead, the protagonist gets no help and no reprieve in his stay at the monster academy. He has to make his own way, and he does so - badass human style. Some of his kills strain credulity, but overall it's an enjoyable work that I'd recommend to this subreddit in particular.

  * [Death is Only the Beginning](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8114428/1/Death-Is-Only-The-Beginning) Bleach. Ichigo is born and dies in time to meet Rukia and Renji as they get their start in Rukongai/the afterlife. It's a fairly interesting take on the Soul Society, and slightly more in-depth than the usual fare. There's not as much action as you might expect of Bleach, but it didn't bore me.

  * [Tale of the Setting Sun](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8963527/1/Tale-of-the-Setting-Sun) Naruto. Standard "Naruto is smarter/better than usual" fare. Enjoyable enough, but I genuinely can't recall much of the story only a month after reading it - so take that as you will.

  * [How Long is Forever?](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11209443/1/How-Long-Is-Forever) Naruto. Sakura time-travels into her younger self, and makes some changes. Chapters are in a slightly non-chronological order, but they still tell a story decently enough, and the concept is pretty neat. Definitely more memorable than the above story, too.

  * [VerÃ¤nderung](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7233479/1/VerÃ¤nderung) Blue Exorcist. Rin accesses his blue fire very early, which results in him becoming more competent and entering a different, perhaps closer, relationship with his family. In the Anime, I found Blue Exorcist's world to be very interesting - but they never quite showed enough to satisfy me (and the final episodes were horrible and clearly filler) - this fic did far better. 

  * [Miserly Old Man, Trickster Fox](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8144246/1/Miserly-Old-Man-Trickster-Fox) Naruto. The Hokage's old friend (an OC) comes to town and takes an interest in Naruto, essentially fostering and training him. The OC can feel slightly grating in the beginning, but he finds his pace, and overall makes for a good addition that fits in pretty well.

  * [A Political Perspective](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10490270/1/A-Political-Perspective) Naruto. The civilian council tries to force Kakashi into passing Team 7. He retaliates by agreeing. Surprisingly well written, fun, and sometimes touching. Recommended.

  * [Coming Back Late](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6471922/1/Coming-Back-Late) HP. Harry comes back into his body late after Voldie hits him with the killing curse. This results in him faking his death for the greater good. Has a pretty good romance with Hermione, surprisingly believable and touching. It's essentially complete, so you won't feel empty after it stops mid-story, not really. 

  * [In Memoriam](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9442823/1/In-Memoriam) Toaru Majutsu no Index. Essentially a rewrite of canon, and for the better in my opinion. It feels like an actual world instead of something cobbled together the way anime worlds tend to. Has a pretty enjoyable writing style, too.

    Will this story be interesting to people who are not generally fond of the romance genre? The majority of romance stories Iâ€™ve met so far â€” especially in fanfiction â€” contained almost nothing else than the romance itself.

    - u/Kodix:

      It's tough to say. The romance is the pivotal element, essentially, but there's plenty of non-romantic events. If all romance was removed from it, I think I'd still find it an interesting story.

  No idea if any of the below are rational.

  Finished G-senjou no maou recently. Highly recommended VN, best one out of the handful I've played so far.

  ***

  Also playing through Alice:madness returns. This is like the inverse of g-senjou: ok gameplay, story is worse than its predecessor (the dialogue is pretty bad too, way too much handholding and meaningless things that sound philosophical), but the art is gorgeous. I'd recommend this just for eye candy.

  ***

  Also also I'm playing the steins;gate VN but while I'm enjoying the playthrough, I'll admit it doesn't contribute much to the series beyond the anime. I'd recommend it to people who loved the anime since the VN itself is not bad by any means but the anime was well enough made that it seems to cover pretty much everything in the VN so far. I'd obviously highly recommend either to those who've watched neither.
  ```

  - u/Golden_Magician:
    ```
    If you're into VNs, I strongly recommend reading Umineko no naku koro ni. It's possibly my all-time favorite piece of fictional media. 

    Plot teaser: October 1986. A rich and extravagant family holds its annual reunion in a western-style mansion on a private island in Japan. A raging typhoon prevents them from leaving while the massive portrait of a mysterious young woman smiles at them from the main hall... 

    It's not quite rational but has rational themes and can reach impressive levels of meta-awareness. It's a bit of an unconventional VN in that it has no gameplay at all- you just read along. Also, no sexy scenes!

    Additional notes: epic lenght (8 separate novel-lenght episodes) and absolutely stunning soundtrack.

    Yeah, I don't usually take screenshots, but this game I basically [treated like a photoshoot](http://imgur.com/a/qAQZx). (Chronological order has been lost in the uploading, I'm afraid. Possibly NSFW for gore on a few pics.)

    They had very good artists, but apparently nobody else of talent, and they clearly ran out of money. (Did they really think we wouldn't notice that they *cancelled a boss battle* and replaced it with a slideshow cutscene?)

    Ohhh, yesss. It was brilliant for me. 

    If you've got a hundred hours or so to waste, then a visual novel can grip you like few other media. [Here](https://vndb.org/v/all?q=;fil=tagspoil-0;rfil=;o=d;s=pop) is a decent list. [Muv-Luv Alternative](https://vndb.org/v92) is a classic time travel story, and I can recommend both [Ever17](https://vndb.org/v17) and [Rewrite](https://vndb.org/v751), as well.

    The only reason I don't get more into VN's is because of the sheer time investment - but nothing else gets me as invested emotionally, and the catharsis that brings is absolutely *delicious*.

    If you've the time, and can bring yourself to ignore or enjoy the explicit parts (there's *always* going to be sex scenes), I heavily recommend VN's.
    ```

    - u/appropriate-username:
      ```
      >Ever17

      >there's always going to be sex scenes

      Not always :) I've played a good part of ever17 but what turned me off it is that the choices seem to be completely unrelated to where the story goes and it takes forever to go back to try another path. The most blatant example of this and what made me drop the game is when [spoiler ](#s " they are trying to get into the himmel door and you're given a choice between two people to try getting in. Neither of them manages to do it regardless of who you pick (and they all always fail the same way) and the story then moves on afterwards. For some completely unexplained reason, there is a single correct combination of people who you can pick to fail the door that leads to the less-tragic ending.")

      I was told to just look up spoilers for what choices to pick to get what ending but that kinda ruins the gameplay/mystery aspect of the VN for me so I haven't finished it.

      ***

      I don't like mecha stuff so haven't really looked at muv luv but rewrite is on my list of things to read through. Hoshizora no memoria looks prettier though so I thought I'd read that first :)
      ```

      - u/sir_pirriplin:
        ```
        About the spoiler part, the important thing is not succeeding at the task (which as you say is impossible) but rather the side effect of trying. The method you choose is a signal of which character you trust the most, and the characters later react to that signal. It's a little weird, but that's in general how VN logic works.
        ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      I also highly recommend Ever17 (and anything by Kotaro Uchikoshi such as the Zero Escape series), but make sure you follow a no-spoilers walkthrough and get ready to suffer through boredom until the last route. It'll all be worth it, though.
      ```

    - u/AugSphere:
      ```
      > Muv-Luv Alternative is a classic time travel story

      People usually recommend going through the whole trilogy to properly enjoy [the traumatic impact](#s " CHOMP") of the third one. I'm not sure it's worth the time investment in the end, but that's the way I've done it. At the very least, I'd play Unlimited before jumping to Alternative. The first one (which is Muv-Luv Extra) is a tad formulaic, silly and even boring at times: this is used to set up a thematic contrast to the later games, which works, but makes the first one a bit of a slog to get through on its own merits. You'd best not expect the way in-game world works to resemble reality, though. The authors also tend to use the word *quantum* to refer to the ridiculous hand-wavy bullshit narrativium rules their world has, rather than the actually sense-making ones of ours, which annoys me a quite bit, but YMMV.

      P.S. Marimo-chan best girl TT_TT
