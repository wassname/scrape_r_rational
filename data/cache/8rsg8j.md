  If Bulma manages to piss off King Piccolo, she'll be 3/3 for pissing off gods. Neat. 

  Also, somehow Bulma is more productive while dead than anyone other than possibly Goku. Amazing, those three years between DB and Z will be spent much more productively.
  ```

    King Kai was pretty productive while dead, to be fair. 

    Also goku was still training after the piccolo fight; that was, in fact, his specific motivation for allowing piccolo to go, and he became significantly stronger during that timespan. I dont forsee this being more efficient, except insofar as goku is already more efficient than his canon counterpart (which also isnt as much as youâ€™d think, because canon goku is a really good example of what it means to actually, seriously try at something).
    ```

    - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
      ```
      My idea here is that OWP Goku is effectively *slightly weaker* at the moment than canon Goku, despite being able to gain a slight edge against opponents like the Ox King due to his faster thought processes. But canon Goku after all is very smart too - only when it comes to fighting.
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        That makes sense, actually. Normally I would expect a smarter character to do better, but Goku is smart at fighting in canon, and he's hella dedicated. he spends years at a time training, without breaks, and deliberately seeks out the strongest challenges to improve himself against.
        ```

        - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
          ```
          Pretty much. OWP Goku is better at lateral thinking, or strategy in general, but his tendency to overthink might effectively bog him down in battle if he lets it take over. Good for him, he also has his "instinct mode", a tendency to regress to a simple animal-like fighting attitude left over from his Saiyan personality, but as seen with Boss Rabbit, that also comes with its own share of problems, like utter disregard for the opponent's life.
          ```

    Well, she would be if she wasn't now blacklisted forever by King Enma.

      I was counting Shenron and King Yemna. Shenron, as I understand it, literally means god dragon.

        Ah, I didn't count the omnipotent Dragon, my mistake. :)

    Well, I'd say it's two different issues. At an absolute level, sure, Enma may be worse (though it's unclear how Hell works in Dragon Ball: it seems to be inspired by Buddhism and there's occasional references to purification and reincarnation, so it may not be permanent; however, erasure of one's memory and personality do not seem a much better fate). But Frieza, or any other mortal, does not know about how and what the afterlife looks like, so if you factor in that ignorance, indiscriminate killing is still potentially as bad as what Enma does, *from their point of view*. I'd argue that how "evil" one is depends also on what they *think* the consequences of their actions are. If one did something horrifying in perfect good faith, thinking they're doing the good of those they're hurting, they may be dangerous, but they're not necessarily evil.

  New chapter, end of arc, and last chapter for a while (one month or so, probably). This one drops some serious bombs, so I look forward to discussing it in the comments!

  Mahogany desk is just canon now. everyone uses it

  so their true master is [](#s "king piccolo"), interesting starting that plot this early.

  Anyway, just to comment for myself: really loving this story so far. I'm a huge dragon ball fan, but I'm a fan despite its flaws, not because of them. It's great to see the setting I love in a way I can love even more; this is definitely one of my top 3 dragonball fanfics. Keep up the good work (Please)>

      Which story is in the third slot tends to cycle depending on  my mood, but soemtimess I would rate one of them about equal to this and sometimes solidly below, I dunno.

  I know nothing about Dragonball, haven't seen it and have little desire to, but I'm surprisingly enjoying this fic. I wonder if someone is going to wish to get rid of hell? It IS a rational fic, after all, and since Bulma has gone to hell (and knows she will again if she dies), it'd make sense. Don't know if Goku or Bulma would feel the same way I do about infinite torture, though, and some might see it as something of a rational fic cliche (if it is, it's a cliche I don't mind, but some people might not see it that way).
  ```

  - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
    ```
    I can tell you, and read on only if you are okay with knowing something that any Dragon Ball viewer would:


    per Dragon Ball canon (or at least, the parts of it I've decided to cherry pick as still valid in my story), existences like Hell and the higher gods are all FAR above the power of Shenlong and the Dragon Balls. Basically the Dragon Balls are magical items, very powerful ones, but still limited. The gods go in hierarchies up to a literal omnipotent multiversal creator (who's also a demented child). In fact, the latest show, Dragon Ball Super, would basically be Lovecraftian eldritch horror about the futility of mortal life in front of the whims of the gods if it wasn't so light-hearted in tone and faced its own subject matter with more of a straight face.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      There's certainly a sense in canon that the dragon balls are weaker, particularly at moments like when piccolo just flat up kills him, but this isn't universal. Elder Kai, for instance, has to sacrifice his own life to revive one person, while Shenron casually does it to entire planets; similarly, shin is limited to transporting a handful of beings at a time with his kaikai, but the wish dragons can move entire planetary populations.
      ```

      - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
        ```
        Yes, it's a whole other inconsistency that's really hard to settle. In fact the Kais seem just woefully weak, especially in light of the fact that they're supposed to be the Gods of Creation who balance out the God of Destruction; where Beerus destroys, Shin should create, so it's weird that they can't give life to a single person; they should be able to create entire planets. I still haven't decided what exactly to do with them, it's complex stuff because the canon really doesn't make much sense there. There's also the fact that Kami is supposed to be the first step on that cosmic hierarchy... except his powers come from him being a Namekian, and the Sanctuary is unique to Earth. Which in itself makes no sense either, if every galaxy has a Kai, why shouldn't every planet have a Kami? It's another situation in which Toriyama IMHO completely made shit up on the fly, he originally created Kami and Piccolo as basically God and Satan, supernatural entities, equals and opposites, then he decided they were Namekians and that whole thing flew out of the window.
        ```

        - u/None:
          ```
          "if every galaxy has a Kai, why shouldn't every planet have a Kami?"

          Don't they? I've always thought that impression was an artifact of how few planets we've seen.

          Earth: Has Kami->Dende

          Vegeta: Never seen directly, but King Kai mentions them having one.

          Namek: Has none, but has recently undergone a massive catastrophe with only one survivor; presumably, the kami died with the rest of the populace.

          King Kai's World / World of the Kais / Beerus' world / etc: Obvious reason.

          Unless I'm missing something, there doesn't really seem to be a contradiction there.
          ```

          - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
            ```
            It's never been clarified, really. I don't remember King Kai mentioning a Kami for planet Vegeta, who would that have been anyway? Kamis seem to be picked from the populace. If it was said, I can guarantee at least that was some kind of anime-original line, or a translation artefact - I've read the manga enough times to remember very clearly these details, and it was never mentioned. What I remember King Kai telling, in the anime, was the story of how the Saiyans overtook their planet from the previous dominant race, the Tuffles. Now in Super it's also been made canon that the Saiyans weren't even original of Vegeta, but they were from Sadala.

            As for Namek, you could argue that Guru was its Kami, or at least had a similar role, but really, he was more of a planetary leader (in a fragmented tribal society anyway). The main point though is, creating the Dragon Balls isn't a special Kami power: it's a Namekian power. So whatever power is infused into them is simply the magic possessed by the original Namekian who made them. But while they can heal, Namekians can't resurrect people, teleport them, or recreate planets. So really, the power of the Dragon Balls does not seem to emanate from their creators; rather, they seem to be using their magic to harvest and control power that already exists independently of them.
            ```

            - u/cae_jones:
              ```
              The reference to Vegeta's Kami is anime only, as it's repeating the lie about the planet being destroyed by a meteor. Unless you want to assume that Freeza counts as a Kami, which, considering that a Kami's role is said to be guiding their people toward happiness, kinda makes sense for the Saiyans.

              Also, regarding Kami and Piccolo: the idea of Kami with linked good/evil aspects apparently comes from Shinto. Super invokes this again by linking the Kaioshin to Birus, but there's also the Makai. It's also pretty apparent that Kami and Daimao *are* a god / demon, respectively. This is apparently a spiritual thing, independent of species (presumably there's a minimum required intelligence, but you seem to have taken that into account with the afterlife scenes in this chapter). The Dragonballs are apparently still a Namekian thing, but Kami comments on Raditz and Goku going to the afterlife, when Daimao's victims did not, as a sign that Piccolo is no longer considered a demon for spiritual purposes.

              I haven't kept up enough with Super and the accompanying supplementary material to know if an answer has been given regarding King Kai's planet / life. Kami did apparently restore Earth's Moon, and I would have expected the other characters to comment if this had been done with the Dragonballs,
              ```

              - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
                ```
                Yes, but see, there's pretty much no question that Toriyama often wrote Dragon Ball by the seat of his pants. An egregious example is the Android saga - there's an interview where he explains how his original idea for the villains was #19 and #20; then the editor said they looked ridiculous, so he introduced #17 and #18; then the editor said they looked too wimpy so he introduced Cell; and again, he had him transform to answer the complaints of his editor about his design - but I think this also applies to the big "now we have ALIENS!" reveal that opens DBZ and that sets the tone for everything that follows. Dragon Ball started as a comedic/kung-fu themed reinterpretation of Journey to the West, but by the time DBZ rolled around, Toriyama had to completely revolutionise the setting to keep it interesting. In that sense, a lot of the stuff that happens before is contradicted by what happens later.

                What I mean is, all those things were said mostly before DBZ; and I think the main explanation for them is that Toriyama retconned them, or straight out forgot about them. He does that a lot.
                ```

                - u/None:
                  ```
                  To clarify; that wasn't actually his current editor. That was his then former editor / freind? complaining about how he didn't like the villain design, and toriyama taking his advice, not an actually forced retcon.

                  Also, we knew about aliens since the martial arts tournament; you could have it as "kami and piccolo speaking in a divine tongue," but it seemed to me pretty clear that that wasn't the intent.
                  ```

                - u/cae_jones:
                  ```
                  IIRC, there's an interview where Toriyama said that he came up with the alien retcon around the introduction of Kami, which leads me to believe the way it played out with Kami and Piccolo, at least, was intentional. I mean, Daimao is a title, more than a name. You see this title thing in Buddhism with figures like Mara. We also have Akuman being officially a native of Hell, and later we have Dabura, and even here we have Gyu-mao (Ox demon king). While Toriyama definitely flew by the seat of his pants, forgot things, and let his desire to minimize work influence things like tails and the SSJ transformation, it seems more likely that he knew what he was doing when it comes to the gods, up until the almost-certainly-unplanned expansion post-Cell.

                  Also, while it's a movie, I think it is relevant that Slug and his minions are referred to as Mazoku, long after the Namekian revelations. There's just this really strong implication that divinity and diabolism are attainable by mortals, with the Kaioshin being the only exception. After all, Kami offerred the job to Goku before Z.
                  ```

            - u/None:
              ```
              Yeah, that was an anime only line. In the manga though, it still isn't a contradiction: we just plain don't know. We never really get to see planet Vegeta, and especially not in the detail that would be required to find out about a kami (remember that most of earth doesn't know the lookout exists). To clarify, I wasn't saying that guru was its kami. I was saying that the kami of Namek presumably died, the same as every other namekian did; as such, I think it would be a reasonable exception to the rule of 1 planet:1 kami. 


              It may well be the case that toriyama changed it, but I don't think we have any real evidence one way or another (since we just don't see many planets), so it seems unsubstantiated.
              ```

    - u/Argenteus_CG:
      ```
      Ah, I see. So getting rid of hell is probably a much longer term goal, if it's possible at all. Thanks for responding. Would a smaller scale wish like for no sentient being from earth to go to hell work? Or is anything to do with hell or afterlives just completely outside of the limits of what they're capable of?
      ```

      - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
        ```
        The show never explored these topics as Hell is treated mostly as a joke; in the latest movie, it was shown that for Frieza (the planet killing villain I mention in the chapter, who's one of the major villains of the entire story), Hell is being dangled in a cocoon surrounded by cheerful and colourful creatures who sing and dance. To him, that's the worst torment imaginable, apparently. Other portrayals of Hell have varied - there's one whole non-canon movie that takes place in it, and it's perhaps the one that hints the most at the worst aspects of it, as one of the protagonists is currently residing there and his plea is taken more seriously than the villains'. But as I said, non canon. In the manga in fact I think Hell never appears even once; all its portrayals are anime original material. It's just said to exist.

        So yeah, it's unclear. But it's said that the Dragon is only as powerful as the creator of the Dragon Balls; and said creator is shown in one scene to fear King Enma; so I'd say, probably impossible. This aspect however is confusing also because said creator is not able to resurrect people by himself, while the Dragon Balls can; so what does it mean that they're just as powerful as him is kind of unclear (my guess is that it was a last-minute patch by the writer to fix the obvious loophole that the heroes try to exploit: just asking the Dragon to defeat their enemies for them).

      Well, it's pretty much what's happening in Super and beyond. Though his motivation isn't some higher ethical humanistic imperative, he just gets a kick out of it.

  So is this fanfic good? Any wants to try pitch selling it?
  ```

  - u/Silver_Swift:
    ```
    It's good, if a bit silly at times.

    The sales pitch from the author themselves is:

    > A "rational" Dragon Ball fanfiction. When Goku was a child, falling and hitting his head erased his memory and completely changed his life. What would have happened if instead of making him forget, that incident had made him much smarter than he was? Meet a new Goku - who's much more clever, has a taste for philosophy, and a bit of a dark side...

    It's mostly just taking the hot mess that is DB (and in the future hopefully DBZ/DBS) lore and characters and constructing some semblance of internal consistency around it while sticking as close as possible to canon. Having never watched DB, I can't vouch for how well it succeeds at this last part, but it's been a very fun read so far.
    ```

- u/SkyTroupe:
  ```
  Excellent! Easily my favorite chapter so far! I love how you've set up future arcs and the implication that people can become stronger than the gods. Really looking forward to the next arc.
