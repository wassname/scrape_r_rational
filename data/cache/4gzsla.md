## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  I need a sort of "offensiveness check".

  I have a short story that's most of the way written which has, as the central premise, that in 1970 a pill was invented which changes homosexuals and bisexuals into heterosexuals. The story is then partly an alternate history of the gay rights movement and partly a meditation on personal identity, social pressure, and terminal/instrumental values.

  Part of offensiveness is in terms of presentation, which I'm doing my best on. I'm more worried about the other half, which is things that I just don't understand as being offensive. And I don't really mind offending people, I just want to do it for the right reasons.

  So is the counterfactual premise of there being a way to no longer be gay irredeemably offensive? Is the idea that some people would choose to be straight and others would choose to be gay offensive?

    Not inherently offensive, but LGBT people often have to deal with people saying that it's a choice, so it's stepping on some toes. People who have traits that are not chosen by them and of which they are also proud don't like the suggestion that it might be a choice. Although your story is fictional and in fact is exploring a *different* world where it is a choice, it may step on toes.

    It's all in the execution. Done well, it would not be offensive. It could in fact be really well-received, if for no other reason than that it shows that the world would be really different if sexuality was truly a choice. Done poorly, it would be in bad taste. 

    For example, if you wrote a story in which people could change their physical sex with a pill, and the entire story was how awful it was to use this pill and how people should keep their birth sex or else it's unnatural, you should expect to get some flak. However, a thoughtful meditation on the nature of sex, gender, and socialization would be great. Done well, I don't expect you'll see problems.

      Other way around, I'd think. If you write a story with a pill that changes someone's gender and you include a strong emphasis on dysphoria and the unnaturalness of feeling like the opposite gender, then you're showing the everyday experience of the non-transitioned transgendered. But if you make a story where changing gender is great, fun, and done casually with no consequence, you're undermining that experience. (When I went to Gencon there was a panel with Ed Greenwood where he explained that gender swapping items and magic had been mostly removed from D&D because they mostly just served to trivialize or make light of the issue.)
      ```

      - u/blazinghand:
        ```
        Oh, interesting! I hadn't thought about that. I was more thinking about it being used by transgender people, and aggressive religious people (and the author) saying that it was terrible and unnatural to use it, but it's true that anything that trivializes people's experiences of dealing with these difficulties could be bad.

    A way to no longer be gay? Maybe not. A pill that medically "fixes" gayness, even in bisexuals? In the vast majority of ways it would be presented, probably. It's taking as its basic assumption that homosexuality is something that is "medically curable," ie, defective, abnormal, unhealthy, etc, even if you don't intend it that way. This plays way too much into the narrative of the anti-LGBTQ community to not press many people's anger buttons, to the point that any nuance might be lost, or never even given a chance to be seen.

    My suggestion would be to have the pill either flip one's sexuality, or make anyone who takes it bisexual so they can "live straight." This still allows all the moral arguments about sexual identity and social pressure and so on, but also allows you to widen the scope of the argument a bit toward people who maybe want the pill for reasons other than to "renounce gayness."

    Or would that change things too much from what you envision?
    ```

    - u/BoilingLeadBath:
      ```
      To be fair:

      * The DSM, at one point in time, did in fact list homosexuality. Now, whether that's worth dragging up to re-examine...

      * Lots of socially-created "conditions" are medically curable: having foreskins, having small breasts... and I pick those examples because there's lots of noisy people on both sides of the debate for/against. Just because the current social climate doesn't prevent doctors from doing something...
      ```

      - u/DaystarEld:
        ```
        >The DSMV, at one point in time, did in fact list homosexuality. 

        The DSM did indeed list it as a disorder, way back before 1973. It was  removed from the DSM-II, though some form of it remained for another version or two. Today it's widely understood as the outdated perspectives of the past affecting clinical perspectives: whether people consider it a disorder is not the same thing as it being one.

        > this doesn't make them unhealthy or defective.

        By whose justification? Certainly not mine, and probably not yours, but the question is about common perceptions.

        By most accounts, the modern, Western argument for removing foreskins is a medical one. The data doesn't support the perspective, as far as I'm aware, and the religious or Puritanical roots of the practice aren't often brought up, but if you actually ask people, it very much is considered by circumcision advocates as a positive health decision.

        Even putting that aside however, the problem with comparing things like foreskin and small breasts with homosexuality as a "socially created condition" however is that they're not nearly as tied with identity and agency, and not nearly as politicized.

          > Today, [the former inclusion of homosexuality in the DSM] is understood as the outdated perspectives of the past affecting clinical [thought]...

          Granted, I'm not familiar with the arguments people used to support the inclusion of the state in the book, but I would be very surprised if the above would pass the ideological Turing test... frankly, it sounds too much like a fully general counterargument against anything which people used to believe, but is now unfashionable.

          ...WRT my examples of medically alterable human features... I was just saying: "look, just because there's a legal surgery for it..."

          ...but you already held that position.

          Further, I suppose you are right - if you use those as writing prompts, you don't get forms which you can use to present the ungaying pill in an inoffensive way.

          (I also think there might be some interesting patterns you could pick up from the social setting of the two situations, though I'm having trouble articulating them.)
          ```

            It's more that the definition, and interpretation, of a psychological disorder has changed:

            “A mental disorder is a clinically significant behavioral or psychological syndrome or pattern that occurs in an individual and that is associated with present distress or disability or with a **significantly increased risk of suffering death, pain, disability, or an important loss of freedom.**”

            That last part is important, as it offers an objective metric by which to judge the difference between someone who likes to wear a wolf costume for, say, sexual adventure, and someone who likes to wear a wolf costume to roam in the wilderness and live with wolves.  The former is a kink, the latter might point toward a mental disorder.

            One can argue that being homosexual in a culture where homosexuals are jailed or stoned to death might constitute a "significantly increased disk of suffering death, pain, etc," but that's obviously the result of their surroundings. By most metrics the definition simply does not apply to those in the Western world.

    Interestingly, this is less counterfactual than you might think. The deaf community has been rocked by the advent of cochlear implants, which is for most purposes a cure for congenital deafness. Some in the community feel that it is a form of genocide, wiping our their culture because "normal" folks consider them impaired, while others consider it a godsend. Those two groups don't get along well, and there's been a rather large cultural upheaval among the deaf community ever since cochlear implants became possible.

    It's not offensive in and of itself, but it's important to understand that emotions run high about this kind of topic and a lot of lgbtq people are understandably defensive of the validity of their identities. So basically you're kind of entering a minefield in territory you aren't personally familiar with. I'm not going to tell you not to write this story, especially since it has the potential to be really interesting, but I think you should practice empathy as best you can.

    I'd be happy to try and answer whatever questions you have, but obviously I can only give you my perspective as a transwoman and lesbian.

    That was a minor plot element in The Forever War.

    As for the offensiveness, a thoughtful exploration would be welcomed by most everyone who reads the sort of stories you write.  That said, you're wading into a cultural minefield, and someone, somewhere will likely be incensed and outraged for some reason.

    Lemme put it this way: it's no more innately offensive than any other form of science-fictional biological self-modification *that general audiences have never heard of, totally fail to consider from the scifi fan's point of view, and will plant big fields of mines in*.

    > in 1970 a pill was invented which changes homosexuals and bisexuals into heterosexuals → some people choose to be straight and others choose to be gay

    I think the only way such a story would be(come) offensive just with this is if the story’s narrative was making it so. For instance, if a premise like this was used to tell: 

    * how of course *all* gay people would decide to change their preferences if given the valid chance, or 
    * how the only people who refused to take the pill were also mentally ill, or 
    * that the majority of gays took the pill and now the population in general had the right to ignore the rights of the rest or to re-evaluate them as being mentally ill, etc.

    >And I don't really mind offending people, I just want to do it for the right reasons. 

    You can’t do that as you can’t be non-offending in general — it’s like rule 34, there will always be someone offended by it, no matter what “is” is.

    Regarding the offensiveness of modification of traits that define a person’s self-identiy: if we use an analogy for this, then the answer comes as obviously negative as well. Is a premise of people changing their gender (species, from organic to inorganic or synthetic, etc) offensive by itself?

  You know, being mindful of my emotions and thought processes is usually fantastic, but it does get kind of irritating in social situations sometimes. I end up in a sort of decision paralysis because I realize that, knowing the reasons that I feel the way I do, saying a certain thing would be manipulative, even if it's true to how I feel.

  I don't know if I got my point across very well there, but eh. Needed to vent a little.

      Yes. I don't like to think of myself as the kind of person that would do that in normal circumstances, but it becomes an issue (well, I say that, but it's really only mildly irritating) because I have the awareness of my emotions and mental state to tell, at least when I'm not in the midst of a conversation (it's less an issue in the immediate sense like that unless I give myself time to think), when the reasons behind my unconscious behaviors is that I want something, and I feel guilty for that.

  Context for this: A friend of mine who's more spiritually and new age minded than I, posted a link to a video by a Leonard Coldwell, which claimed that every (yes, EVERY) cancer could be cured in 2-16 weeks or even less. I looked up the guy and found him on the rational wiki, being torn down as a fraud and whatnot. I'm just curious as to how accurate this is, as I don't have the time (or emotional investment) into doing a proper investigation of investigating someone that perpetrates, or is purported to perpetrate, scams successfully. It's notoriously hard to parse the good data from the bad.

  **No knowledge of Log Horizon is required to respond to this post.**

  I'm in the process of writing a Log Horizon fanfic, the basic premise being that the akihabara adventurers figure out a difficult, but feasible way to cross back to the real world.

  Seeing as I'm heavily limiting how often people can cross, I don't need to deal with the full scale of the social fallout. Still, people are going to react to people who vanished from their homes while playing an MMO suddenly returning with functional immortality and fantastic magical powers (not to mention the whole different-species thing.)

  So to pose my question, how would *you* act in that scenario?
  ```

  - u/ulyssessword:
    ```
    I'd consider the economic impacts of magic.  In order of how important things are: 

     - craftable (or easily accessible) reusable magic items
     - imported (or rare) reusable magic items
     - common single-use magic items
     - character abilities
     - rare single-use magic items

    For each of those sets of magic sources, I'd look for the following effects:

     - magical healing and resurrection (preferably of more than just combat wounds)
     - teleportation and other travel spells (preferably safe)
     - scrying and other information spells
     - infinite energy sources (preferably with high power/weight ratios)
     - everyday needs
    ```

    Clearly "magic" is acting on our universe if it's disappearing people from their homes. What kinds of apparent physical laws can magic violate? Can we track side-effects of magic in the form of light/particles/gravitational waves/nanobots? If so, are there interesting patterns to these side effects that can tell us more about magic? What are magical objects made of at microscopic scales? Can we put magic in a quantum superposition? Does magic respect the lightspeed boundary?

    >how would you act in that scenario?

    Barring the option of visiting Elder Tale myself, I would be curious about the travellers but also apprehensive of them. Meaning, that I’d be avoiding any direct contact with travelers I don’t know anything about while also trying to evaluate how much the travellers I *did* previously know have changed in personality and moral views. Would try approaching them for cool stories if they turned out to be bros and not homicidal maniacs.

More likely they will, in which case I'll try to make my way to the game world (If that's possible). Read up on everything about the game, of course.

      You didn't go into the game, you (probably) aren't fantastically rich, you (probably) aren't in Japan, you (probably) don't have a strong personal connection to any of the returnees, etc.

        Hmm...are you sure that's what OP meant?

        Anyway, if that is the case, Knowing myself and my current means, I'd most likely learn about it from the international news. Probably a social media platform of some sort. In which case, I'd be way too late to have any actual, meaningful impact on the situation in general. So I'd move on with my daily life, much as I do now, discuss how jealous I am that some other nerd out there has MMO based powers instead of ME with my equally nerdy friends, and then pray to the God I don't believe in that the people who have more power over the situation (namely the adventurers and the people/agencies that are going to be involved with them) don't do something irredeemably **stupid**.

          I did mean that your perspective is as a (mostly) unconnected observer-- you may have knowledge about the game, and you definitely knew about that one time where literally tens of thousands of people dissapeared while playing a game, but you're not directly connected to anyone involved. (Although you probably know a friend of a friend involved-- it affected one in every approximately 7500 people in Japan, mostly people around the ages 15 and 20, and the proportion is probably similar in the US.)

          Thanks for your response, by the way.

  Some stories...

  Recently read for the first time:  
  \- *[Benefits of Old Laws](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11540013)* (*Harry Potter*; 145k words, ongoing): Upon his resurrection, Voldemort regains his sanity, exploits a centuries-old law to avoid prosecution for his past crimes, and seeks to resuscitate the Noble House of Slytherin by adopting Harry as his son.  
  \- *[Crime and Commitment](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11626470)* (*Worm*; 132k words, ongoing): Various changes--the Travelers don't leave Boston, Taylor decides to breed larger insects, etc.  
  \- *[A Propensity for Wrath](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11449804)* (*Worm*; 129k words, ongoing): Taylor gets the power to sense emotions in others and to imbue objects (mostly weapons, armor pieces, and rings) with her own emotions (wrath = explosive force, love = healing, etc.). This has some interesting interactions with Gallant's emotion-sensing power.  
  \- *[Seed](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11450150)* (*Worm*; 207k words, ongoing): Taylor gets Blasto's power, and conducts some very interesting experiments involving clones of Butcher, whose power is a special one in the cycle of shards. Other changes also exist (e.g., Coil and Accord are allies in control of Boston).  
  \- *[Intrepid](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11224198)* (*Worm*; 320k words, ongoing): A story somewhat-confusingly split between the viewpoints of Taylor and her three bullies, of whom each gains a power.

  \- *[The Hogwarts Strike Team](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10807718)* (*Harry Potter*; 219k words, dead): Harry and Hermione go back in time in order to thwart Voldemort's failsafes, which made Britain uninhabitable after his death.

    Hahaha! What!? That must be one heck of a loophole! Now this I gotta see!

      From the second chapter (edited for English):

      > "In the early 1300s, a potions master tricked several witches to drink a potion that made them lose their bodies. He then proceeded to force their spirits into bodies he created for them--bodies sewn together from animal parts, or so the sources claim.

      > "However, what is of interest for us is the law made in the aftermath of these occurrences. To help the victims of this madman, a law was created stating that anyone forced from his body could not, after gaining a new body, be hold accountable for what he did before gaining that new body."

    Dumbledore *did* want Harry to have wicked step parents.

    ...Or so he said. While pretending to be mad. In a fanfic.

    Also, what's wrong with singular they? It's so good.

    Upvoted for Crime and Commitment.  Just read up to the most recent chapter and really enjoyed it.  It starts out looking like a stomp fic but then escalates and enters the cycle of cliffhangers and daring plans that dominates Worm.  Also, an awesome villain that has a power that seems like a joke but can take on heavy-hitters.

    >  Holly Evans and the Spiral Path (Harr

    Would recommend Spiral Path also, though with the warning that it is a heavily sexualised story. I’ve been waiting for it to get completed for ages now because I don’t like reading writings in process.

      It's well-written, but it gets very weird and very dark. For people who like it, it's very good, but if you find yourself getting uncomfortable at some point, you should probably stop. It's not temporary.

    Definitely rec Seed. I just love the way it deals with her various horrifying creations and the way her shard makes her not realise how fantastically creepy she's being.

    I tried this way back when and never got to the end (and it has since grown immeasurably). The author had let exponentials write him into a corner.

    * The Worm-verse has a shitload of powers, and a shitload of people.
    * In a given person, each combination of powers produces a different result.
    * Any given combination of powers produces a different result depending on who is carrying it.

    And all these things were really cool when Taylor and Tattertale were playing around with 3 or so powers... But as Taylor stole more and more powers, and met more and more allies, the number of possible combinations went through the roof. I'm only willing to read so many pages of people being granted different powers and showing off new effects.
