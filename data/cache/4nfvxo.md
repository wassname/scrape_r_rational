  I rather enjoyed this chapter in spite of its lack of action (which is not, to me, a downside), though it is clearly setup for the future. Looking forward to the next chapter!

    Much obliged. I've spent much of the past month enthralled by the incremental changes that my new depression meds have been effecting. Unfortunately empirical data seems to suggest I'm most creative during periods of flux in dosage, which seem unlikely to arrive any time soon so I've no idea when I'll be writing the next. At least I have a solid idea of what's going to happen next which has been a solid roadblock for quite some time. 

    Anyway, in this chapter I've been trying to channel ~~Al-Armiah~~El-Ahrairah which has managed to deliver fantastically tense scenes despite little actual combat. I hope that I have succeeded in some small way, though that story still eclipses mine by quite some margin. Ah, but I do still try.
