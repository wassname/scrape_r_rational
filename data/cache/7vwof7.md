## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  I've started cobbling together a new setting, mostly as stress relief from a different thing I've been writing. I did the slightly unwise thing of writing something that wasn't very story-like first, and then trying to work out the rules that would enable it.

  The setting is a battle school that favors one-on-one melee battles between students, with the occasional team battle or special match thrown in for flavor. To that end, I want:

  * No permanent death/injury on the arena floor (but available elsewhere)
  * A magical combat system that produces a healthy metagame
  * Unique weapons and armor
  * Meditations on class, privilege, and politics

  I'll probably be posting to these threads over the next few weeks, so that I can try to flesh this out more; this is intended to be a side project, not a deep, no-holds-barred sprint of work.

  Further, I'll be taking some of /u/ultraredspectrum's thoughts on how battles, summarized from conversation on Discord:

  * The "rules" of the fight must be known to the reader, not in the sense of what rules they're operating under, but in the sense of "player A wins if he can stall" or "player B wins with his big finisher or not at all" or "player C loses if his opponent figures out his trick".
  * Each fight should be different from the last in some way, because repeated fights with the same opponents, circumstances, and strategies are uninteresting.
  * Each character is linked in some way to their strategy/power, so that each fight is about characters in some way, rather than merely being a fight.

  The "healthy metagame" aspect is probably the hardest thing, which means that it should come first; it's not at all hard to make rules that people would be forced to fight by, but it *is* hard to make rules that create a chaotic and shifting set of strategies used by individual actors with no stable equilibrium.

  Rock-Paper-Scissors is probably one of the easiest unstable equilibria, so that's where my mind first went. A simple, melee-combat oriented example would be that speed beats power, power beats defense, and defense beats speed, which would be trivial to create a magic system for, but also only results in three possible matchups. Something like Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock offers more matchups, but I find that (and variants) a little lacking.

  What I'm toying with right now is the idea of having two RPS cycles that can work for or against each other. Each person would have two attributes, picked from two different pools, and each matchup would be dictated by the major and minor cycle. For example, if Power>Defense>Speed>Power, and Plant>Earth>Fire>Plant, then you could have nine different different configurations (PowerPlant, EarthSpeed, etc.) and 45 different matchups, which would break down in different ways:

  * Synced cycles are curbstomps: because it's a win on both the major and minor cycle, victory is almost trivial (e.g. PowerPlant >> DefenseEarth).
  * Half cycles favor one participant, more if it's a major cycle, less if it's a minor one (e.g. PowerPlant > DefensePlant, PowerPlant >= PowerEarth).
  * Counter cycles are essentially toss-ups, determined by skill or gear, rather than the selection (e.g. PowerPlant = DefenseFire).

  This needs fleshing out, since the PDS/PEF cycles are placeholders, but I think the bones might be solid enough to build off of, especially since each character can have their own techniques within each configuration, their own personal preferences, possibly some unique abilities, and some complexity with weapons and armor. What's needed most in terms of fleshing out is determining how/when people can change their configuration, ideally in such a way that allows for some mindgames and game theory within the structure of the battle school.

    Mhh... One thing I got from watching extra credits is that rock-paper-scissors metagames are more interesting when they're unbalanced. At least, this feels more interesting to me.

    Like, for instance, maybe Fire is clearly the most powerful of all elements, on average, by a wide margin. Water and Shadow beat Fire, but Fire beats everything else by a wider margin than every other elements. That means that the distribution of powers is asymmetric. Instead of being sorted roughly equally in the different categories, most beginners choose Fire, because it's the comfortable choice, most people with a little experience choose Water because it beats Fire, etc. At a higher level, people maybe start choosing some combination of elements or switching elements at random between fight so they can't be out-predicted.

    What if participants are able to build their configuration during the fight? An opening move might be to attune a particular attribute and begin gaining abilities associated with it?

    So, someone might start off by attuning Power, while his opponent foregoes any attunement in favor of a martial opener, ending the fight immediately. Alternatively, someone attuning Defense would be able to immediately deflect a martial strike, thereby gaining the upper hand.

    Perhaps experience could determine how fast someone can attune a particular school. So at a higher competitive level, fighters can attune so fast that a martial strike would be effectively useless, no matter what attunement was chosen. Furthermore, people might be more familiar with certain attunements and powers that using other attunements, even if better from a metagame perspective, would be inferior to their preferred strategies.

    And don't forget about combo victories. Like if someone is using some kind of acceleration ability, and starts stacking the ability to gain unlimited time. (For that particular scenario, perhaps the downside is that if their time is doubled, their senses are halved, so they'll also need a way to improve their senses; abilities that mess with their senses might be particularly effectively against them, essentially stopping the combo from working.)

    ---

    Maybe the abilities used in their competitions are unique to the arena? A 'natural' phenomenon, so to speak. This would allow people to use outrageous powers while explaining why they aren't used all the time in world-breaking ways. Perhaps participants have to fight over who gets which abilities as they spawn from the arena.

  I'm planning out my first ever quest on Sufficient Velocity and I need help looking for similar works ~~to plagiarize ideas from~~ for some inspiration.

  The idea of the quest is that the protagonist is stuck in a reoccurring lucid nightmare and he needs to escape within an unknown time limit. The quest is meant to have the players discover the rules of an bizarre new world where the rules of physics and logic may not necessarily apply.

  I'm basically requesting any recommendations that involve a dream world to get some ideas for writing the scenery or modifying the dream logic/rules.

  Something else that may also help me are stories that involve exploring a maze/labyrinth since the nightmare is set in a maze-like abandoned city.
  ```

    ```
    - Anything can appear in any out-of-direct-sight location.
    - Things tend to appear when the protagonist thinks of them - this especially includes terrifying monsters from the depths of his own psyche.
    - Nothing (including the protagonist) can be permanently destroyed or escaped from. However, clothing will vanish at the most embarrassing moment possible.
    - Running doesn't help.
    - Playing dead *does* help, but the monster never exactly goes away and will attack instantly the instant you stop playing dead.
    - If it's out of sight, then it's *right behind you*.
    - *It's going to get you.*
    - You are already too late.

    --------------

    Those rules seem pretty nightmare-logic to me.

    I really really like this idea, because I love the absurdity available in dreams.  My suggestion is read (or reread) a bunch of Lovecraft's really weird stuff, because he does a great job of explaining just enough that you're forced to let your imagination fill in all the horrors that you know are so abundant, and I think that's a great quality for writing about dreams.  We've all got different ways of letting our brain run away in all the wrong ways, and of course that's doubly true for dreams.  Lovecraft takes full advantage of this by using vague superlatives that feel like they describe what he's writing about but really leaves all the good stuff up to our imaginations.  Of course if we're talking dreams then I've gotta mention [The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath](http://www.hplovecraft.com/writings/texts/fiction/dq.aspx), but a lot of his stuff reads like a nightmare taken flesh, which I suppose is what he was going for.

    One more thing, something that I've noticed about my own dreams and nightmares is that often someone makes an assumption, and it's as if it was always the case to everyone involved, even if it very clearly wasn't not two seconds earlier.  Might be a fun way to keep people on their toes, not that you need too much of that with an idea like this.
