## [D] Friday Open Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.

  [WHO WOULD WIN in a competition between my dog and my cat?](https://i.imgur.com/5x2kMlt.jpg)

  Let's say they compete to knock each other off the above log, because they may be rivals, but they're still friends :]

  [PIPSQUEAK (DOG)](https://i.imgur.com/c5jbLC8.jpg):

  \+ Heavier (12 lbs)

  \+ Heavily armored

  \+ Longer reach and teeth

  \+ Far more fighting experience (14y)

  \- Not as limber as in youth

  \- Nuclear sclerosis may limit vision

  \- Most teeth removed

  [MONTE (CAT)](https://i.imgur.com/uucxPom.jpg):

  \+ Cat, with cat-like reflexes

  \+ More versatile and pointy claws

  \+ Very sneaky

  \+ Can do a pull-up

  \- Poor depth perception and field-of-view

  \- Smol boi (7 lbs @ 8 months)

  \- Easily distracted by rustling leaves, passing birds

  (PS, Monte was on leash here, I just magic-wanded it out)

      That does seem to be the consensus from those I'd asked. What sort of handicap do you think would be enough to even the match (to, say, each side winning 5/10 times?). What if Monte had an eye patch on? Or was mildly intoxicated (say, to the equivalent of a human at BAC 0.08%)?

      You are right in that Pipsqueak would forfeit first. Monte tries to play with him as he would with another cat, but that's not a language the pup understands. So he mostly just runs away ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

      Ah, thank you for the advice :] in this case I'd say he's more a smol boi right now, and in comparison to the pup -- everyone seems to think he'll grow up to be quite big, and from looking at charts e.g. [here](https://avmajournals.avma.org/doi/10.2460/javma.255.2.205) he may have a few more pounds in him yet. 

      Otherwise, he was castrated pretty early and is on a (fairly regimented) AAFCO All Life Stages diet. I think that should be sufficient for development and growth (my partner's not a nutritionist but has rotated through a veterinary nutrition block and they seem cool with it).

    I think bodyweight is more important than others are giving credit to here.

    * Assuming they're in a one-off competition, I'd give it to the cat 3:2.

    * Give each of a them training on the combat log every day for a week and I'd give it to the dog 3:1.  

    * Bloodlusted (but still not *actually* hurting each other), I'd say dog 10:1.

  Some miscellaneous thoughts after (an out of order) rereading of Worth The Candle:

  * Joon eats Elk strips while at the barren jewel hotel.  Many chapters later we learn that elk are extinct but an entad called the Jade Elk mass produces Elk which are slaughtered for their meat.

  * Rereading old comments, I saw someone speculate that Joon’s Earth is a simulation also because his hometown is literally called Bumblefuck.   I thought this was an over literal reading, but on reread, Joon consistently refers to it as Bumblefuck not just as a description, but also as a literal proper noun, so this is a more convincing than I first thought.

  * I can see several places were the Outer Reaches anti-meme might have cut off conversations and line of thought.  In particular, the discussion with Heshnel’s group that turned violent might have had a major and critical discussion because it is so similar to the Dungeon Master.  This could be why Valencia was thrown off so hard and it could have influenced the direction of the conversation in a way that pushed O’kald and Evertt to violence and left Joon’s team with no memory of it.

  * side note: I think I missed if they checked:  can spirit magic effect/sense Valencia? (If not she can’t help them with the Outer Reaches stuff).

  * I can see in hindsight I can clearly see how Joon doesn’t give Fenn enough credit or take her serious... but this definitely doesn’t justify Valencia, indeed it seems like something they could work out and change their habits.

  * All the stuff with Bethel’s threats are painful to read in hindsight...

    The town definitely isn't literally called Bumblefuck. Even if his town were a simulation, which seems like a bit of a narrative dead end, it would have to be a poor simulation, or at least one highly divergent from ours, to have a Midwestern town be called a derogatory term for Midwestern towns. If that were changed, the whole origin world or simulation would have to have a series of other changes to support it, which isn't in the text.

    He does call it Bumblefuck highly consistently, but I think that's a function of AW not wanting to name the town but having to refer to it relatively often. It does sometimes feel like sour note..it feels bitter to call your town that a few times but fully pathological to call it that every single time. Not really inconsistent with the characterization, though.

    Any word on when the next chapters will drop?
    ```

    - u/tjhance:

      I too think it's not literally called Bumblefuck but also I gotta admit narrator-joon is committing to the joke pretty hard.

      new chapters are already out for patreon subscribers, so they'll be out for everybody sometime tonight.

    - u/scruiser:
      ```
      The DM has added winks and nods in the form of anagrams and puns all over Aerb, so it isn’t implausible they would add them to an Earth sim.

      Given all the other oddities (Cidium being over a million years old while Aerb is only 30,000 years old) and improbabilities the DM has pulled off (Aerb versions of Juniper and friends living out lives nearly identical to their Earth counterparts), it wouldn’t be that hard for the DM to either simulate a midwestern town with a weird name in isolation as opposed to a full Earth or to simulate a full Earth with a fabricated midwestern town and then put an anti meme effect on the town’s odd name.

      If Joon switched through various derogatory  nicknames, I wouldn’t consider this theory, but he uses the name Bumblefuck even in contexts that aren’t derogatory. Still given the quasi-SI nature avoiding using a real town name makes sense.

        In my experience, removing one mindless time-wasting habit simply leads to it being replaced with another mindless time-wasting habit.

        Instead of just eliminating the time-wasting, you're likely to have more success if you can manage to fill your time with the things you should be doing, instead.

        If that's the case, better to just give the account to a trusted friend and/or arbiter that can change your password so that the process is reversible. Either way is a form of precommitment, but while a reversible version is a lesser precommitment, it potentially preserves something that has some value to you. Besides that, there's a risk that after three months or so you find yourself just making a new account, or get used to browsing without an account, or otherwise adapting to the inconvenience, in which case it would be better to be able to go back to an old, established account. (I would probably give your account holder a timeframe before which you should absolutely not get your account back, as well as a questionnaire to your future self in case you decide, for whatever reason, to pick the account back up.)

  What is the ultimate endpoint of a rational story? I am making a DnD campaign and I am trying to make a rationalist faction.   They are undead so they don't have to die or worry about food,efficiently rational. The regular fantasy kingdoms all hate them, instant conflict.

  I can't develop a plot that is both emotionally and narratively satisfying about it though. Everything ends up with full luxury automated queer transhumanist space communism. Which is rad, but not a dramatic adventure. Or if I turn the rationalism down, it just gnaws at the back of my mind they could be doing better
  ```

  - u/FunkyFunker:
    ```
    Rational doesn't mean intelligent, well-informed, powerful, etc. In DnD terms, being strictly rational is more along the lines of having 20+ Wis. I don't think an undead rational faction is so different from the trope of a single high Wis mastermind lich/necromancer with endless hordes of undead.

    Also, why not have FLAQTSC as a goal? Tonnes of DnD campaigns have the ultimate endpoint of 'the party ascends to godhood and saves the world'. It certainly makes a lot of sense for a faction to strive towards imposing their idea of utopia on the universe. 

    As for the dramatic adventure, consider the perspective of the min-max murder hobo treasure goblin. Burgle kingdom treasuries of rare magical artifacts, manipulate fools where possible into profitable trade deals, cheese dungeons where ever possible for sweet loot. All this for the purpose of gaining power, preferably discretely, and eventual apotheosis.

    Overall, I don't really see how a rational faction would differ so significantly from a typical fantasy faction beyond the high Wis aspect.
    ```

  - u/Sonderjye:
    ```
    In addition to what others have mentioned, I think that any rational storyline in the DnD setting needs to deal with the gods. If everyone is happy in the afterlife, why do you want immortality on the material plane? Could a better world happen in which the focus were to convert everyone to the dieties that had the best afterlives? This could easily result in either the characters finding themselves dissatisfied with the available afterlives, finds that the afterlives don't quite work as advertised, or that a supermajority of the gods are against undeads and will actively oppose them in their dream for an undead utopia. Any adventure that involves battling gods can easily become dramatically satisfying, though you need to be careful in how you define gods and their powers.

    Suppose I was in the OOtS campaign I would have major objections both to the dwarven afterlife(modelled after a christian view of the nordic afterlives in which it's aweful to die not fighting) and for the Snarl.

    Your rational undead faction is a slow AI; a growing corporation; a growing area of positive growth or a cancer. It just dep[ends on perspective.  Every other faction is made of people they could add to their numbers and using land they could desecrate (making it better for undead), so whatever their goals they will want to expand, possibly slowly and through legislation, possibly through portals and blitzkrieg, if your friends are like minded, and you care for big video gamish plots you might have a sobering story by making them a faction to be put down or assisted in taking a neighboring kingdom/ the world/ the plane. 

     If you want them as a semi static but no reed richard is useless faction make them slowly expanding: demesis near them will be conquered between stories with any stored treasures and cohorts lost, nearby villages with contacts are still there when re-visted, but have been coqured or co-opted and some notables died in the process. The grey steppes (or whatever you name them) are welcoming to those who can survive and do not abuse the mindless undead on their periphery (those that they have not yet recovered from their first death, as the process does take time and skilled undead, but who provide a cheap first line defense and will eventually be returned as incorporeal intelligent undead if struck down)

    You don't need any big plots: their slow meticuliously planned campaign of expansion, and the contracts between the quality of un-life within their border, the pain outside an the horror of the expansion should give you all you need. As enemies every perosn is  competent level appropriate threats in a optimized OODA loop, as patrons they are welcoming, generously equipping, scarilly prepared, and very tight on operational details as the players (assumedly) are not yet undead so their loyalties are questionable.

  - u/Teulisch:
    ```
    think. whats availible, how can we use it? what are the options? what costs will you pay to get what you want?

    for D&D, dont forget the warforged as another option that needs no food or water. and in general 'everyone hates you' is a much bigger problem, because it implies adventurers wanting to murder you more often. possibly high level adventurers. 

    for adventure... you always need more materials to make things with. some materials are from dangerous monsters, and now the undead need to hire adventurers to get things for them. could even be an open bounty. 

    the next problem, is what is luxury to the dead? why, they could just lock themsleves in a tomb and stay hidden for a hundred years or so. boring, but safer than being exposed to everyone hating them. and for that matter, would it be better to move to another plane? the githyanki went to the astral where they dont age, or need food or water.

    /u/VapeKarlMarx Sorry for the double reply and direct ping, but in case you are not aware of it, there is a IMNSHO an epic creation myth for your faction: Ashtosan the grey necromancer. Audio tale with the just released prequel is here: https://youtu.be/wSGek9VitHQ (there's 2 other videos in that channel that tell a creation story of a settlement of intelligent undead from the POV of a generally law/good inclined adventuring party that also includes a morally ambiguous necromancer whose origin is in the linked tale).  OP is username /u/FelixLaVulpe (giving credit/making search easier for someone else, my apologies if pulling you in somewhere unfamiliar) and inspired my original post about the faction with his outline of what the settlement ends up as here: https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDGreentext/comments/6dhjd5/of_undead_understanding_the_dead_exodus/di2wtch/

    I'm very uncharacteristically still up early in my local, so apologies in advance for typo's, unwanted pings, and or any offense (It was unintended).

    Edit: (a typo) & Hey, even if they are undead and working toward The culture AKA "full luxury automated queer transhumanist space communism".  I'm going to assume you take away their founder, think about history of political development in light of their circumstances starting from an enlighten dictator who didn't plan on (whatever removed/transcended them) for more than five minutes and then decide on a starting point for the slow superintelligence they are.  They have the browning motion of humanity, clade distinctions an conflicts of interests, the new lore adding material components to making intelligent undead provides a significant market  undead for rare goods down to the level of  everyone who has a missed relative, there's a lot of "merely human" stories as grist for your mill they try to make their way from a immortal, possibly sense deprived, or hoping to be sense deprived, (think intelligent zombie or skeleton) middle aged lower classes, to The Culture.

    Yup, that gets discussed sometimes. Three issues, in increasing order of importance:

    * It's really hard to estimate the expected value of that kind of intervention.

    * It's political, which will alienate people (which reduces donations). Right now a conservative, a libertarian, a communist and your grandma can get together and agree that more mosquito nets would be nice, yay EA. Not so if EA starts to be about e.g. establishing a carbon tax, or redirecting military budget towards foreign aid.

    * It's a crowded market. We can expect all the low-hanging briberies have already been done, and now you're just committing your piddling strength to a zero-sum tug-of-war. The biggest EA wins are where nobody else gives a shit.

  In related news I've been sorting through my bookshelf and made a pile of books I need to read. I think I'm going to try and read them (all?) in 2020.

  In further related news my 2020 is going to be hectic:

  - Trip to LA / SF in Feb (hit me up anyone who wants to meet up with me, CouteauBleu and SvalbardCaretaker can both confirm I didn't murder them, or if I did murder them I replaced them with bots based on GPT2 of their posts)

  - Probably going to have to apply for a promotion in Feb too, and government jobs take about 12 hours of work to apply for (I actually have a decent chance of getting it, like, 25% probably??)

  - French boyfriend coming to visit for March

  - Studying part time from Feb-June

  - ~Month in Paris in July

  - Studying part time from August-November

  - Want to finish Vampire Flower Language Volume 1 (about 7 chapters uploaded)

  - I have a full time job, by the way

  ... actually that's not so bad. It's really the first three months that are going to be hectic. 

  ----

  Finally, this is the year I really have started putting beeminder goals for like everything. I realised I haven't played the new pokemon game as much as I wanted to because I was playing Tower Defense on my phone instead, so I have literally made a beeminder goal for playing the new pokemon game, which is cray, because I'm like optimising my leisure time because that's apparently how Type A I am now?

  And my motto that I've had since the middle of November and will have through the end of 2020 is "No Fucks Given". I got it from an enamel badge I bought, and it's proving instructive.

    It’s not clear what chapter you stopped reading... so I might spoil something... the animorph’s efforts to communicate to the rest of the world has pushed the conflict with the Yeerks to a global scope, to the point that the Animorphs struggle to find ways to meaningful contribute, until a few more Elimist/Crayak shenigans gives them a few key opportunities.  Esplin (Visser 3) continues to be devious and several canon elements are introduced and remixed in creative rationalist ways.

  So I've been toying around with an idea where magic, at its core, is kind of evil/bad, the rules for which are that "mana" can only be obtained by causing suffering. This brings up a lot of interesting questions about how to get mana in the most moral ways (probably self-harm) and how exactly you'd go about measuring suffering. Which brings us to a scenario I have for yall, let's say you sneak into someone's house in the dead of night, waterboard them for hours then dry them off, use magic to delete their memories of the torture, and put them back to sleep. They'll probably wake up exhausted with something like a super bad sore throat but that'll be the extent of their suffering (I'm probably oversimplifying the potential physical dangers of waterboarding here but I'm having trouble thinking of another way to cause intense physical/psychological suffering without also causing severe injury). Where does this rank on the immorality scale? It obviously isn't a moral act (unless maybe you juxtapose it against the costs of letting the Bad Guys win because they're willing to do worse stuff to gain more mana), but is it worse than torturing animals? What if the person agrees to be tortured in exchange for money/something, is it still immoral? Is it immoral to only torture "bad" people, essentially going the Dexter route? It should probably be noted, that by wiping the victim's memory of the torture, you are preventing a steady trickle of mana that would come from their lifelong trauma.
  ```

  - u/xachariah:
    ```
    If you're allowing animal suffering, you could probably just install capture equipment around factory farms and end up with more mana than humanity would know what to do with.

    Actually, this might be a pretty nice world.  Assuming you can objectively measure suffering, if you could make sufficiently precise suffering detectors, you could use it for all sorts of applications.  You could walk into a store and buy a mattress that is proven to reduce suffering by 21 microfloggings a night versus their nearest competitor.

    \> Is it immoral to only torture "bad" people, essentially going the Dexter route?  


    Yes,although you could say it's lower on the immorality scale than torturing innocents, since if someone really needs to torture it's better than it is the worst people.But It still rates very low on the morality scale and you should really make sure its the only way, and preferably not do it at all.

    I'm not going to say that you should never torture people for power since your specific scenario sounds like it could lead to some situations where that is actually the best choice, but I will say you should act like that's the case since otherwise you are likely to rationalize yourself into doing horrible things instead of finding out a better option.

    Especially since its doing bad things for power, humans generally can't be trusted with doing bad things to get power to do good things.Instead you could just get someone that is a big masochist and or turn yourself into one and then get mana trough self harm, and enjoy it.Like in Efflugence   [https://belltower.dreamwidth.org/8579.html?style=site](https://belltower.dreamwidth.org/8579.html?style=site)

    Or you could maybe cause mild inconveniences to lots of people instead depending on how mana scales.
