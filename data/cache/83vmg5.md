## [D] Monday General Rationality Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics!  Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world?  Have you:

* Seen something interesting on /r/science?
* Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
* Figured out how to become immortal?
* Constructed artificial general intelligence?
* Read a neat nonfiction book?
* Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?

  Ok I want to rant about the movie Annihilation.

  Just the whole process they take doesn't fit any remotely reasonable mission plan or scientific method.

  There's this "shimmer", a barrier created by something that is expanding.  "Every team or drone they ever sent inside has never come back".

  Ok, well, that doesn't sound like the inside is very habitable.  So the logical thing to do would be to create a huge variety of drones - clockwork drones, film cameras on a pole, hell just a really long stick - and try to get _something_ back from the "shimmer".  (a clockwork drone is basically like a small 4 wheeled vehicle with a mechanical spring motor and some mechanical logic.  It would basically be programmed to drive around a little, scrapping some sample scoop against the dirt on the other side, then come back)

  Say you can't get any information back no matter what you try.  Well then you don't send people in.  Or if you _do_, their orders should be to try to leave the moment they find themselves inside.  Not 'explore the place and then presumably die'.  

  Also if whatever is creating this barrier is so powerful it can stop you from getting any information from inside, and it's expanding, this is a serious existential risk to humanity.  This is not something to keep secret for 3 years.  This is "crash plan to abandon the planet" kind of scenario.  

  (presumably if the barrier is going to take decades to swallow the planet, you could build Orion drive colony ships and get millions of people and lots of infrastructure off-world to the Moon or Mars before the end.)

    Limited resources and greed/need. You need a situation where violence is the only way for at least one actor to be satisfied. 

    A common way to organically create conflict in video games is to provide a limited resource of some kind and to allow fighting to control it. By monopolizing the resource/area by force a group makes more than they would sharing it.

    >emotions, misunderstandings, self-defense... these seem like cop-outs because they're obvious narrative devices.

    They're not cop-outs. They're basic realities of the human experience. That's why they crop up time and time again, throughout fiction. They reflect real life.

    Now, I could start a big argument about how even "rational" people are driven by emotion, but I want to focus on misunderstanding instead. You call it a cop-out, because of course no truly rational person would ever misread or misunderstand a situation. They're too wise and enlightened for that.

    But that's fucking nonsense. No-one has perfect judgement. Everyone makes mistakes. You are conflating "being rational" with "having perfect information", but they are not the same thing. Two characters might be perfectly rational, reasonable people, but if all they've ever heard about their counterparts is that they're greedy, selfish, sons of bitches, they're going to act on the basis that said information is true.

    Now, you might argue that a rational person would take the time to verify that what they heard was true. But human beings do not have time to scrutinize every single shred of information they receive. If we did that, we would never get anything done. Sooner or later, we have to have faith that our sources are correct, and not mistaken or lying.

    Even if the characters did take the time to meet, so they could judge each other for themselves, that still doesn't protect against mistakes. Human judgement is incredibly biased, in ways so subtle that they are almost impossible to notice from the driver's seat (as it were). For one thing, the human mind is biased towards maintaining existing beliefs. So even if the characters tried to analyze each other as fairly as possible, the fact that they've already been primed to see each other as assholes is going to colour their readings (and probably not for the better).

    *And even if* the characters took the time to verify what they'd heard, *and even if* they were capable of judging each other as fairly as possible, any number of things could still get in the way. Their flight could be delayed. A family emergency could arise. Their horse could trip and break its leg. A malicious third character might sabotage the meeting. The best laid plans gang aft agley, after all.

    Now take all these problems, and put them in a situation where time is of the essence, and the characters have to make a decision now, *now,* **NOW.** That is where tragic mistakes occur - at the intersection of misinformation and pressure. Rationality will not save you there.

    Violence imposed by above? Like in a Battle Royale sort of setting, or even a Practical Guide to Evil one, where the gods intentionally push the world toward perpetual cycles of violence?
