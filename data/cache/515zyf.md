  So, Uriel's previous estimate was 50 years of working physics in 1990, thus ending in 2040. With 20 years shaved off, that means the "present day" part of the story is at best 3 years away from the machinery collapse, assuming Thamiel didn't manage to trick Uriel again.
  ```

    ```
    I wonder if names used by humans draw on Uriel's light reserves or on the unfiltered light entering through the crack.

    If the former, then I guess that would explain UNSONG. And if we *are* in the final years, then the 58-letter Vital Name could drain a significant amount of power - maybe enough to not even work more than once.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      This is a really good and elegant hypothesis, but I don't see why names would be powered by Uriel's stash of light - it seems like they should be using the stream of light that's constantly flowing into our world instead. Before the Skycrash names didn't work because Uriel had cut off that flow, even though his own reserves were full. It also seems like names were working even before Uriel's reserves existed in the first place.

      ```
      Granting a soul to something happens all the time to humans, why should it be exorbitantly more expensive for an inanimate object?

      Or is there some source that the longer the Name the more power required?
      ```

      - u/Arancaytar:
        ```
        In the first chapter Aaron mentions some correlation between length and power, the longest known so far being the Wrathful Name. Later on, it's mentioned that the Mortal Name (the shortest magical one) was the last to stop working.

        Maybe artificial soul-generation is somehow more expensive than natural... but yeah, otherwise it wouldn't make sense.

    What's the first sentence of UNSONG again?

     > The apocalypse began in a cubicle.

    Well, shoot.

    Significant figures are important! There could be up to 8 years before machinery collapse.

      Or a few more or less, depending on how many optimizations or expensive superpositions Uriel's done since then.
      ```

        And how many folks decide to blow off steam by boiling a goat in its mother's milk.
        ```

  ```
  There are a whole bunch of ways she could get around that prophecy depending on how prophecy works.

  >All the descendants of the Comet King, he said, would die screaming in horror and agony, cursing their fatherâ€™s name.

  I bet she will do something like stop being her father's descendant. Or maybe she thinks of herself as daughter of Jak... instead of Comet King.
  ```

  - u/DCarrier:
    ```
    Or "father" could be referring to God, and since Thamiel is a facet of God, she could be cursing his name.
    ```

    - u/scruiser:
      ```
      She learning the Kabalah, so intentionally subverting a prophecy with clever word play would be perfectly reasonable for her.
      ```

      - u/DCarrier:
        ```
        I guess that's nice, but personally I'd prefer to subvert the dying in agony part.
        ```

        - u/GeeJo:
          ```
          The Comet King owned a lot of land. Why not rename one of the towns "Agony"? Maybe build a nice retirement community and hospice there.
          ```

          - u/ThatDarnSJDoubleW:
            ```
            Naming a town Agony is basically asking for bad not-a-coincidences to happen there.
            ```

            - u/GeeJo:
              ```
              So repurpose a Colorado town whose name already has Kabbalistic similarity.

              From a very cursory glance down Wikipedia's [List of cities and towns in Colorado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_and_towns_in_Colorado), one that jumps out at me immediately is **Dolores**, already being named after suffering.

              I'm sure you could find a better choice going down the list - Agony derives from the Greek word "Agon", meaning Contest. So kabbalistically, "A contest ending in pain". **Alma** was the first battle of the Crimean War, part of the *Great Game* between Russia and Great Britain that ended in the Russians' humiliating and painful defeat. Any towns on the **Purgatoire** river. You could look up towns whose syllables match any of the [Hebrew words for agony](https://www.google.co.uk/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=agony+in+hebrew). Etc.

              A bit of time and creativity could easily find better ties than I could in ten minutes. The Comet King had plenty of both, and a solid motivation to weasel his way around the prophecy.
              ```

        - u/scruiser:
          ```
          Maybe she figures out how to work Kabalah through colored substances and pain and then uses this to curse Thamiel?
          ```

          - u/DCarrier:
            ```
            Perhaps she writes a name of god in her blood. She'll be in pain because of the cut.
            ```

  - u/Blackdutchie:
    ```
    We have been learning about names of god for a while now, will she die because of one? Then she can curse the name of god, the father, as she dies screaming in horror and agony?
    ```
