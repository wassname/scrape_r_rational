  I didn't win the contest, c'est la vie. I still had fun writing this story, and now that the contest is over I thought I'd give it its own post.

  ```
  Predatory black holes?
  ```

- u/FeepingCreature:
  ```
  No, this is a good thing! It's _localized_ - we can get away from it. Plus, new and exciting physics! If space-time itself can support predators, it can support colonists. We need to play for time - small colony ships, seed populations, spreading FTL hundreds at a time in all directions.

  We know we can outrun it. The rest is exponentials.

    I got the feeling it was rapidly enclosing the entire solar system.
    ```

    - u/FeepingCreature:
      ```
      Yeah, but FTL ships exist - this is in principle survivable.

      It's like A Colder War - Cthulhu made manageable by cold pragmatism.
      ```
