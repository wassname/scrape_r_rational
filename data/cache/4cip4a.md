  This is by the same author who wrote Crystal Society, the first of the [Crystal Trilogy](http://crystal.raelifin.com/).

  I haven't actually read that work myself, but this short story is just as thoughtful and well-written as I expected based on the very positive reception of Crystal Society here.

  Or, to sell it another way, it's a DS9 Star Trek fanfic looking at Ferengi in their element.

    Crystal Society is definitely worth reading. I just finished it yesterday, and it was probably the most clever thing I've read since Worm.
