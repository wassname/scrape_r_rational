  Even as Fanfiction.net went back online, the link still does not seem to work for me. It just keeps loading and never goes anywhere.

    Apparently it needs a www in the URL. Try [this](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11922890/9/Harry-and-Hermione-Starring-in-The-Digital-Revolution).

  I like this take on the Potter's Fidelius Gambit. It makes a lot of sense in this scenario to make someone besides Black the real secret keeper.
