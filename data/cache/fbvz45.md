  ```
  Note that this is the 8th volume in a very, very long series, which is best read in order. (I'm finally starting to work on an abridged version, which can hopefully cut out all of the extraneous subplots and keep the rationality.)

- u/Slinkinator:
  ```
  Ahhhhhh, my favorite continuing web fic has updated once more. Thanks a million, this is perfect timing for my flu.
