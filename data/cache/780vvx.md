  I guess this is as good of a place as any to weigh-in on the whole death conversation. While I'm totally on board with radical, unbounded life extension (provided that we can ["solve life"](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/77lzq9/cgp_grey_about_death_and_the_false_pedestal_it/don1xp7/?st=j92yyr06&sh=1abefe82) as /u/eaturbrainz put it), I don't think that death is as bad or even as meaningful as people think it is. Well, to qualify: death is very bad *currently,* since life is so short, but in the limit of lifespan the badness goes down to zero.

  Let me explain.

  There is, of course, the heat death of the universe to deal with, which provides a physical upper bound on possible lifespan. The actual upper bound for most people must come sooner, though, since near the end, there won't be enough free energy to sustain previous populations, and the resources of some people will need to be cannibalized to extend the lives of others. You could still probably get in 10^100 good years though.

  But far sooner than that, you'll run into memory limits. You, as you currently exist, cannot survive past much more than a few hundred or a thousand years in any circumstances, simply due to the memory capacity of the human brain. Eventually, you'll forget all your old memories, and your values may drift over time. Compare the you right now to the you in 10,000 years. If the two of you don't share any memories or values, in what sense are you meaningfully the same person? The you of the present has just died slowly and continuously over the course of a few thousand years. In fact, this has already happened to you. Do you remember much about your early childhood? Probably not. And as a child, you certainly valued far different things than you do now, and if asked, would have said that you never wanted to stop valuing them ("I don't wanna grow up!"). Effectively, child-you was murdered by puberty. Should we then medically stunt puberty to prevent child death?

  Suppose you can artificially expand your memory capacity. Great, you've delayed the inevitable. After a few billion years, your mind will hog a large amount of physical resources preserving all those memories. You can either continue hogging resources until the entire universe is just you, or you can let the old memories die to allow new people to exist.

  But then there are the mathematical limits. Your mind is just a specific type of dynamical system, after all, no matter what laws of physics implement it. Even if you could in principle expand forever, I think it very likely that the dynamical system will become unstable and either bifurcate into multiple entities, or just cease to be conscious in any sense meaningful to original-you. In other words, "you" have a maximum finite size.

  Suppose you could surpass the heat death of the universe and live for infinite time. What happens to a finite system over infinite time? It repeats itself infinitely often, necessarily, by the Poincare Recurrence Theorem. And now you're at Nietzschean [Eternal Return](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_return). Sure, maybe you could find a way to randomize the experiences in some way so that the order never repeats itself, like the digits of an irrational number, but in the end you're still repeating every single experience infinitely often. And if the [B theory of time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-theory_of_time) is true, then this state of affairs may not be meaningfully distinguishable from living for a long finite time in a block universe where all time-points are equally real. Such as the universe we probably live in now.

  Of course, there are a *lot* of possible experiences to be had before repetition occurs. But maybe not as many as you'd think. After cutting out the undesirable possible experiences, which are either horribly painful, just "meh," or are completely random noise, you're left with a small subset of meaningful and desirable experiences. Many of which are similar enough to be lumped into equivalence classes. At the end of the day, it might just be possible to have every meaningful equivalence class of experience before your 10^100 years are up. Maybe save storage space by uploading everyone's memories into a single galactic memory database, which individual people can "check out" or contribute to.

  ---

  When you take in all these considerations, "death" as a category starts to look rather meaningless in the limit. In once sense it is unavoidable, and in another sense you shouldn't have ever expected otherwise. The induction hypothesis of the "proof by induction" argument for immortality just sort of fizzles out after 10^n years of life.

  If any of these ideas seems horrifying or painful to think about, I suggest that it is a good idea to re-align your expectations so that you are happy and content with this state of affairs. After all, worrying about what you cannot change is pointless suffering, and as transhumanists we seek to eliminate all pointless suffering.

    Ok, so maybe I'm the weird one out here, but...

    I remember a fair amount of my early childhood.  I have a few isolated memories of infancy and being a toddler, but I've got *plenty* of being a child, then an adolescent.

    I also ended up feeling like my teen years were the "odd years out".  Teen me was a horrible person and didn't even *enjoy* being teen me -- total edgelord loser with no sense of getting off his ass.  Adult-me is basically a lot like kid-me, but with more life skills and an interest in sex.

    Is it really so ordinary to wind up an intuitively dramatically different person after nothing but *puberty*?

      > Is it really so ordinary to wind up an intuitively dramatically different person after nothing but puberty?

      That depends on how old you are. Right after puberty, you are still very continuous with your child-self, but that fades over time, I think. What you have said mostly describes me as well, though I don't remember much about my childhood before age 10 except in a weird dissociated third-person. My values  and concept of fun have drifted with experience as well. But I'm only 23. My parents remember even less, and are presumably much more different than their child selves.

      Still, the "child-murder" thing was a bit of a rhetorical exaggeration.
      ```

      - u/eroticas:
        ```
        I don't care all that much about continuity in the first place, but I remember fairly well back till 2. I know the memories are accurate because I've used them to draw maps of old locations and had them confirmed by adults. I liked it when my loved ones were happy and took pleasure in much the same things I do now...affection, food, fulfilling the preferences of others, dancing, singing, sunlight, striving and achievement, even sex... I haven't changed that much - my basic values seem stable. Everything since then has only been increasingly sophisticated means to achieve this for myself and others. 

        Of course I am... more ...now than I was then. But I don't think any highly important stuff was lost. In any case, yes, I'd definitely self modify to forget less stuff if I could do so without ruining anything else. You don't need to modify the brain necessarily, you can just make faithful sense-recordings that the brain may revisit.

        I'm 28.  I feel a little different from child me, but really mostly continuous.  Maybe because I've retained more memories, or kept more of the old books or something?
        ```

        - u/LieGroupE8:
          ```
          I mean, I feel continuous in the sense that I don't remember any discontinuities, and I have the same core personality. But child-me had lots of specific beliefs and fantasies, and if you asked him, he would have said that he never wanted to let them go. Now, I've mostly forgotten them, and I don't really care about them any more. As for my memories before age 10, it's not that I have less capacity for remembering my childhood than average so much as I haven't actively reinforced those memories in a long time. If I try, I can sort of access some of them, but they seem very distant and vague. They are more like general emotional impressions and flashes of images that I'm building into narratives about myself.

    I think most of us agree, then, that there is a point of diminishing returns.  But it's still possible to do immensely better than we can now.  I feel like my life is just starting, there's such an enormous amount of basic stuff I haven't been able to do (mostly from lack of financial resources), and I'm in my 30s.  

    Already, biology has decided to make me less physically attractive and possibly less mentally capable than I was in my 20s.  Screwing me over before I ever even get into a financial position where I can enjoy my life.  And this life timeline of mine is still far better than the typical experience of most humans who have lived in the last 100 years.  

    Even if I get things together and have a brief 'golden age', 50 is a little over a decade away for me.  60 just a little over 2 decades.  Our lives are actually stupidly short, even if it doesn't necessarily feel that way on a day to day basis.

    If my brain were converted to a digital system and sped up a million fold, I could experience far more interesting things by living millions of years in virtual reality, exhaustively exploring the possibility space I cannot explore as a mortal sack of meat.

      Agreed: aging is terrible and minimum lifespan ought to be extended as far as possible. I'm not sure how long I want to or even could live while retaining my current personal identity (could I maintain my sense of self over a billion years? I have no idea), but at least as an immortal I would have the option of changing my mind later.
      ```

        Right.  Vast, far off states we can't model, ok, that's fine.  At the moment I just want to be around and in good mental condition a mere century from now.  

        I feel like we can do it.  That machine intelligence agents can give us the kind of leverage we need to make the advances we need to make this possible.  I don't mean self-willed entities that run amock, just optimizers that can figure out how to arrange matter to create nanotechnology, and how to reprogram human cells to fix their software flaws, and so on.

  - u/MultipartiteMind:
    ```
    My reaction to the 'finite system over infinite time' concept is effectively 'Okay then, so we need to (try to) work out how to make our systems non-finite.'.

    Assuming bounds, we get entropic death.  From the existence of *anything* at all rather than Nothing, we postulate something-out-of-nothing and get hope.  If the universe has a finite time, maybe we can break out of the universe and get infinite time.  If any one physical system has physical size constraints, maybe we can tap into infinite dimensions and become entirely unconstrained, stepping up maybe-infinite steps of higher mathematics and Even Higher Mathematics in all the infinite permutations that can exist, as well as seeing countless civilisations made up of minds of all sorts of intellectual levels.

    Maybe we can't.  Maybe we'll reach a point of knowing everything meaningful, and know futility and despair.  Maybe we'll die then, or earlier, and it will end up being just as final, just as pointless an ending as if we gave up and ended the path right now.  But right now, there's still subjective hope.  Since we don't know for sure--and even if it looks certain, we can still doubt the completeness of our understanding--there's still a sliver of hope that giving up isn't inevitable.  I for one am willing to pursue that infinitesimal possibility of success rather than surrender early to 100% failure.

    'think it very likely' (that my success is not possible) is not enough to deter me, not before I've personally wrestled with such issues and done my utmost to resolve them down to the very last quantum unit of available time.

    -----

    In the past, on happily fewer occasions than would need a whole hand to count, I've thought I was about to die.  My feelings at the time can be summed up as a resigned 'Oh, well.'.  The absence of hope is not unnecessary suffering to be prevented, but rather the presence of hope represents more resources to be greedy for, more that can be done, experienced, remembered (even when so much of what is remembered is, for the time being, frustratingly lost as though by a 'tax').  By crippling our ambition, we can be happier, perhaps.  By crippling our desire to read new books, we could perhaps be happier in our ignorance, living a simple life in which we never read a single book and never felt the slightest suffering from difficulties in getting new books.  I do not fulfil goals in order to become happy, and if I did could use more direct methods.  I approve of myself being happy when my happiness is a symptom of *doing what I want to do*, accomplishing things which I want to accomplish, which is fulfilling such goals.  Learning, experiencing, remembering, growing (at least where relevant for myself).

    I don't think the finite memory thing is necessarily a problem. If I have a ruler and am trying to draw a straight line longer than the ruler's length, I can just draw the line using the ruler, then line the ruler up with the line I previously drew, and so on ad infinitum. This works even for very small rulers. In a similar way, as long as the trajectory of my actions is always satisfying to me within the range of whatever memory capacity I possess, it seems like I can achieve meaningful personal growth.

    The other things you point out are more serious.

  >Death is absolutely necessary. Death is the Great Equalizer. A world without death is a world where the status quo reigns supreme. Where the powerful and wealthy are free to concentrate power and wealth without any check what so ever. Remember: the greatest horrors of the modern age have been wrought by man not nature.

    > Remember: the greatest horrors of the modern age have been wrought by man not nature.

    Anyone who believes this is implicitly trivialising the literal billions of deaths to "nature" in the last 100 years.

    Hitler is very high up on the scale of human evil (depending on how much culpability you ascribe to failed political policy, e.g. Mao's cultural revolution, he could be the pinnacle), but smallpox alone killed hundreds of millions.

    So, which is more horrifying? I expect you'd still say Hitler, because you, like the majority of people, ascribe more emotional significance to human action. If that's the case, your heuristic is biased. You aren't objectively evaluating horror, you're evaluating the perception of horror.

    To be clear, I'm not judging you for this. In fact, I feel the same. Human action is more horrifying to me because it's intentional, implicitly avoidable; don't do the evil thing, problem solved.

    But humanity isn't even in the same league as nature.

    Even if humans were responsible for 10% of all deaths (an incredibly high estimate), we'd still be [less deadly than ischaemic heart disease](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs310/en/).

    As for the rest:

    > Imagine if the monarchs of old never died. Imagine if the various dictators of the present and past never left.

    Monarchs and dictators still exist but society continues to erode their power. I don't think that tyranny is sustainable in the long term. A benevolent dictator, perhaps, but not a despot.

    > A world where universities are run by faculty so hidebound by tradition and what they WANT to believe that science stalls.

    Unless they were themselves omnipotent they'd find it very hard to stop people experimenting. Even if you can't get published because of some implausible global conspiracy to ignore the facts, you can still profit off your discovery.

    > Where capitalists are free to hoard money and influence without bound.

    Why would a post-death society permit this? How would they enforce their dominance over an ever-growing immortal populace that remembers every injustice, unless they shared their wealth to placate the middle class (as is done now)?

    > What would society look like today if millions upon millions of confederates and kkk members were still alive?

    Are you suggesting that the only way to reform a population is to wait for the people that hold the offending views to die? If so, we've been wasting our time having political discussions and reforming prisoners.

    > Lastly. On deaths relationship with humanity in a broad sense: What makes us human isn't our individuality. It is our society. While death is a horror to an individual human it is necessary for societies.

    Okay then, how about an alternative solution to the 50+ million natural deaths per year: we make humans immortal, then kill those necessary to ensure society progresses. We'll kill, say, 40 million carefully chosen people per year.

    Would that be more horrifying, or less horrifying? Certainly it would be more efficient than hoping that the random distribution of death happens to facilitate progress. In fact we may even be able to scale it back after a while.

    Which brings up another point: do you have a ballpark figure for the limit of a human lifespan, beyond which society collapses? And if we do eventually approach such a long span, will you be campaigning for the shortening of your own life to prevent catastrophe?
    ```

    - u/18scsc:
      ```
      Allow me to more narrow the scope of my argument slightly, strip out some extraneous rhetoric, and more clearly state my thesis: The technical hurdles standing between us and a desirable post-death society are less daunting than the societal hurdles for the same outcome. Moreover, there is not insignificant tail risk of some truly undesirable (dystopic even) post-death societies. 

      I will note that I am no moral naturalist, although the language I'm using might make it appear that way.

      The base premises upon which this argument is built are as follows

      1. Suffering in life is worse than the cessation of life (aka death). Consider, if you were given the option between A) spending eternity as a low-status laborer in North Korea, or B) dying instantly, painlessly, and without warning at some point in the next 3 years, which would you chose? * 

      2. It is easier to tame nature than it is to tame humankind. Harm mitigation involving nature is fundamentally a problem of science and engineering; progress is made with precision and rationality, once progress is made here it rarely vanishes. Harm mitigation involving humankind is fundamentally a problem of politics and culture, progress comes in fits, without precision or regards to rationality, progress is quite vulnerable to regress. 

      3. While nature causes more cessation of life than man, man causes more suffering in life than nature. At least in the modern age and in developed countries. In many cases where nature does cause harm, it is more because of human failings than nature itself (for example, the truly mindboggling amount of death and suffering from the Spanish Flu was in large part due to the chaos and unsanitary conditions of WW1).

      \* You might chose A if you thought the knowledge of your upcoming death would be awful, but even that would be suffering in life.

      -----
      Now on to address more specific grievances.

      >Hitler is very high up on the scale of human evil (depending on how much culpability you ascribe to failed political policy, e.g. Mao's cultural revolution, he could be the pinnacle), but smallpox alone killed hundreds of millions.

      >So, which is more horrifying? I expect you'd still say Hitler, because you, like the majority of people, ascribe more emotional significance to human action. If that's the case, your heuristic is biased. You aren't objectively evaluating horror, you're evaluating the perception of horror.

      Horror is a fundamentally subjective term, there can be no unbiased and universal assessment of it. That is why I used the word horror instead of death. This fits in to premise 1, in that "horror" or the extra emotional distress caused by human harm (as opposed to natural harm) is responsible for quite a lot of suffering in life.

      That said, I kind of which I hadn't made the point in the first place. It was more rhetorical flair than anything else.

      >Unless they were themselves omnipotent they'd find it very hard to stop people experimenting. Even if you can't get published because of some implausible global conspiracy to ignore the facts, you can still profit off your discovery.

      The main manifestation of the problem would not be global conspiracies or a concentrated effort, and more a lack of interest and/or funding. Also in the process of getting a PhD, with avent garde PhD candidates receiving less support and unfairly tough dissertation defenses. I will cede that the scientific progress wouldn't stop, but it would slow.

      >Monarchs and dictators still exist but society continues to erode their power. I don't think that tyranny is sustainable in the long term. A benevolent dictator, perhaps, but not a despot.

      I think you're ascribing to a more linear view of history than I am. This trend of western liberalism and democracy is fairly recent, with it only gaining global prominence in the last 100 years. On a larger time horizon, it could be nothing more than just another historical fad. Moreover, there are many countries that are supposedly democratic (at least in a representative sense), but are actually controlled by oligarchs or "elected" heads of state that wield dictatorial power. Russia being the prime example.

      >Why would a post-death society permit this? How would they enforce their dominance over an ever-growing immortal populace that remembers every injustice, unless they shared their wealth to placate the middle class (as is done now)?

      You're right, it is entirely possible that we could achieve a desirable post-death society. 

      Wealth is a form of power, so I'll stop mentioning it explicitly, but it is one of the main forms of power I have in mind here. Those with power almost always seek to preserve their power, and most seek to gather more power. It is the powerful who have the most capability to enact or block change. 

      Indeed, there are tons of things going on right now where you could ask "why would a modern society permit this?". The answer being that the powerful don't care enough to change things, or they're actively fighting against change. I'm not speaking of conspiracies, it's more that there's a degree of selection bias and perspective-limiting path dependency involved in the pursuit of power.

      Additionally, any anti-aging tech will be expensive as hell for a long time. As such the wealthy will be the first to benefit and will benefit more (from higher quality treatments). If the treatments are expensive for long enough, it's entirely possible a poor person could be born into a world where Mark Zuckerberg is 50 years old and die in a world where Zuckerberg is 130 years old (and still making tons of money and gaining vast influence).

      >Are you suggesting that the only way to reform a population is to wait for the people that hold the offending views to die? If so, we've been wasting our time having political discussions and reforming prisoners.

      In the US, at least, we really do not try to reform prisoners. It is also entirely possible, no, extremely likely that most of the time we spend having political debates/arguments is a waste. Now political debates and arguments are different than discussions, but I think they represent the majority of political discourse between people with different views. 

      Simply put, most people do not use reason to inform their emotions, but rather they use reason to justify their emotions. Look into [identity protective reasoning](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/03/this-article-wont-change-your-mind/519093/) and the [backfire](https://daily.jstor.org/the-backfire-effect/) [effect](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Backfire_effect) (two separate hyperlinks there). 

      For this reason modern political campaigns (in the US) are based more around increasing the turnout of one's political base and depressing the turnout of the opponents base, than they are about convincing swing voters. This might be somewhat different outside of a two party system, but I'd wager that's because citizens of such countries have more complex political identities, not because they're less susceptible to identity protective/motivated reasoning.

      >Which brings up another point: do you have a ballpark figure for the limit of a human lifespan, beyond which society collapses? And if we do eventually approach such a long span, will you be campaigning for the shortening of your own life to prevent catastrophe?

      That's a good question, and I'm not entirely sure as to the right answer. I don't remember if it was the CGP Grey video, or the companion Kurzgesagt video, but it was mentioned that it's entirely possible anti-aging tech will let us live healthy lives, but only up until we hit the theoretical upperbound of 120. I think that would be great, it would reduce suffering in life by an unimaginable amount and avoid many of the things I'm concerned about.

        What if you presented these same options to a low-status labourer in North Korea? Live forever with the status quo, or die within 3 years? I think they would choose the former; death has always been an option for them, but eternity has not.

        Despite what we would consider terrible living conditions, people in those situations overwhelmingly choose to continue to live. A literal Hell in Biblical style would be a different matter, as would some medical conditions (those that cause significant physical or emotional pain over an indefinite period).

        > It is easier to tame nature than it is to tame humankind.

        I agree with this point, but I don't think that taming humankind is made appreciably easier by the existence of death.

        > While nature causes more cessation of life than man, man causes more suffering in life than nature.

        This is a tricky thing to quantify. If somebody goes hungry because a warlord steals the donated food then that's a human crime, but the donation was a human gift and the fact of hunger is a natural burden. Presumably we lay the blame at the feet of the warlord, but what about nature, that made their land barren in the first place?

        Nature's suffering has been largely curtailed in the developed world. It still recurs in some situations, mostly medical issues or natural disasters, but in general it isn't nearly as extreme as it is in developing nations.

        > The main manifestation of the problem would not be global conspiracies or a concentrated effort, and more a lack of interest and/or funding. Also in the process of getting a PhD, with avent garde PhD candidates receiving less support and unfairly tough dissertation defenses. I will cede that the scientific progress wouldn't stop, but it would slow.

        The beauty of a post-death society is that it doesn't matter nearly as much if progress slows. Everyone will get to reap the benefits eventually.

        By contrast, if somebody in our society discovers a solution for malaria (i.e. a way to eradicate the disease, not cure instances), the difference is about 400,000 lives per year (and many more who suffer from it without dying).

        I don't think this is a very likely outcome for academia post-death, anyway.

        > I think you're ascribing to a more linear view of history than I am. This trend of western liberalism and democracy is fairly recent, with it only gaining global prominence in the last 100 years.

        Western democracy may be recent, but democracy has been brewing for thousands of years. I'd argue that the global trend is strongly in that direction. Military coups still happen from time to time, but a military coup is a lot less threatening if they can't actually kill anyone. If they *can* kill people, then the leaders of the coup can in turn be killed.

        It seems very unlikely that a world which is able to band together enough to cure death will slide back into tyranny.

        > Additionally, any anti-aging tech will be expensive as hell for a long time. As such the wealthy will be the first to benefit and will benefit more (from higher quality treatments). If the treatments are expensive for long enough, it's entirely possible a poor person could be born into a world where Mark Zuckerberg is 50 years old and die in a world where Zuckerberg is 130 years old (and still making tons of money and gaining vast influence).

        It's true, but it's also the status quo. The rich can already afford better treatments than the poor, with correspondingly longer lifespans.

        The only way to counter this would be to ensure that people all live the same amount of time. As long as wealth is able to influence this, no finite span will ever be universal (unless you enforce it through other means, e.g. genetic alterations). And given that wealth affects diet, exercise, mental and physical health, etc., you'd have to be in a post-wealth society as well.

        > In the US, at least, we really do not try to reform prisoners.

        That's a tragedy which should be remedied independent of any life extension technology. It does support your point about "Why would a modern society permit this?", however.

        > It is also entirely possible, no, extremely likely that most of the time we spend having political debates/arguments is a waste.

        Yet people do change their opinions. Consider [the Australian same-sex marriage debate](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-08-31/same-sex-marriage-who-supports-it-and-who-doesnt-hilda-data/8856884) (which is our own "Why is this still an issue?" problem). 19% support for same-sex marriage in 2005, 46% in 2015. I don't think that 27% of the population was replaced in the intervening 10 years, which strongly implies that attitudes shifted.

        Individual debates may not have much impact, but society trends nonetheless. You don't even need to convince that many people to start snowballing progress.

        > That's a good question, and I'm not entirely sure as to the right answer. I don't remember if it was the CGP Grey video, or the companion Kurzgesagt video, but it was mentioned that it's entirely possible anti-aging tech will let us live healthy lives, but only up until we hit the theoretical upperbound of 120. I think that would be great, it would reduce suffering in life by an unimaginable amount and avoid many of the things I'm concerned about.

        Assuming for a moment that 120 is the right figure (which I certainly don't have the analytical skills to do): if we ever manage to push the upper limit of a human lifespan beyond 120, will you oppose that, even when it comes to your own life?

        Hm.

        1: Well, in some cases. It's possible to suffer so much that life is not worth living, yes. This is not very common, however, and becomes less so if our ability to keep people healthy and alive longer increases. Because living an eternity as an abused slave would suck worse than dying after a good hundred years of life, I suppose (still debatable) but living for two hundred years as an abused slave and then another two hundred of a good life is better than dying after a hundred years of good life. 

        The problem with death is not the moment of death, that's a tiny sliver of time with no real weight. It's not the suffering of the ones left behind, that's a side-effect. It's the loss of potential, all the future good that never happened. So the question becomes, is the totality of your future a net positive or not? I'd say in most cases it is, because most experiences are better than nothing.

        And, well, infinite life is such a large step, I believe it to be more pertinent to talk about extending life first, and ending aging for example. As a sidenote, that's also my response to all the 'you'd get bored of life' people - maybe I would, maybe I'd choose to die after a few thousand years of life, but I still want that choice, and a hundred years is not even close to reaching that point.

        2/3: Well, we get into the problem that humankind is part of nature and lives in the midst of nature and untangling them isn't so easy. Lack of resources is part of nature, and that's one of the big causes of humans heaping suffering upon each other. Or, as you mentioned, the Spanish Flu causing so much death and suffering due to factors both 'human' and 'natural'. 

        I agree that the end of aging would lead into a very confusing and difficult societal transition which has the potential to end poorly, but I don't think that's a reason to not make the attempt, because the status quo is bad enough that it's worth it to try, and I feel we've a fair chance of ending up on track to a better world. Most worlds would be better if, like me, you believe that in almost all cases life is better than no life. In addition, it feels a bit like trying to stop the development of nuclear power because of the potential of nuclear weapons. It's going to happen eventually anyway, the earlier we get to it the better off everyone'll be and there's no reason to believe we'll be better able to handle the consequences in the future than right now.

        Speaking of nuclear war, I don't really know if ending aging would make it more likely, or less. Sure, societal upheaval might ensue. Or more stability. Maybe leaders (and followers) who now have much more to lose would shy away from the button. What I do think is that such a trajectory, wherever it may lead, would happen on the scale of maybe a hundred years or so, and trying to predict a hundred years into the future is thoroughly futile.

        >  Moreover, there is not insignificant tail risk of some truly undesirable (dystopic even) post-death societies.

        I think variants on this theme are the most plausible arguments that death isn't that bad, or is even morally necessary, after a certain point. In the past, [I've argued that](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/56se39/d_monday_general_rationality_thread/d8m8xtm/?st=j95s34ew&sh=c77b6002) there may be a point at which more moral good is done by creating a new person than by continuing to use the same resources for a long-existing person.
        Society may stagnate when the same people exist for long periods of time, stuck at a local maximum, not exploring all the possibilities of well-being that we might want to exist. And there is always the risk of falling into permanent dystopia.

        I'm not necessarily convinced by these arguments. It is easy to reverse immortality if it's not working out well, but not the other way around. I also think that the technology of immortality will also allow us to modify the brain's reward system enough to prevent greed and psychopathy from existing. A periodic randomization mechanism for avoiding stagnation, both on a societal and individual level, is also a good idea. 

        Immortality is irresponsible without an accompanying change in human psychology and societal organization. My idea of utopia involves radical freedom in a post-scarcity world where no one ever chooses to do evil not because of some totalitarian surveillance, because evil just isn't any fun.

    >While death is a horror to an individual human it is necessary for societies.

    As an individual human, I strongly disagree with this sentiment.

    It's not that this isn't a legitimate problem, it is, but you have to ask yourself if the current price we are paying to avoid having to deal with it is worth it. Because that price is unbelievably high: we sacrifice one person to the reaper for every four seconds by which we extend the status quo. Is the problem of stagnating societies really so bad that not having to deal with it for another couple seconds is worth a human life? 

    You claim that aside from violence and war the only alternative for societal change is hoping that the people in power literally drop dead. I happen to think that this is not true, but even if it was, the death toll of one war per generation cannot possibly be higher than the death toll from ageing, can it?

      See my other comment for a better explanation of my position.

      Not the only avenue for change, but they are the main avenues for mass change. Even the quintessential example of peaceful change, the civil rights movement of the 60's (which is itself a total white washing, but whatever) was [empowered by the backdrop of the Vietnam War](http://www.americansc.org.uk/Online/Vietnam_Civil_Rights.htm). 

      We have been lured into a false sense of security in the post-WW2 era, doubly so in the post-Cold War era. The violence and war we see around us today, and imagine as so terrible (because it is) and so vast (which it isn't) is [*nothing*](https://youtu.be/DwKPFT-RioU?t=14m20s) compared to the carnage of the world wars. Which themselves pale in comparison to the potential devastation modern great powers can inflict. Much less the great powers of a future in which we have the technological ability to stop aging. 

      That's just wars *between* major powers  and *without* nuclear weapons. When nuclear weapons are factored in, any conflict a nuclear power is involved in has a risk of nuclear exchange, including civil wars (no great power has had a civil war in decades). That risk may be lesser or greater, depending on the context, but any step closer to the edge of our extinction (or at least the wholesale destruction of modern advanced societies) is a step that should be made with great great great care.

    No, making it marginally easier to change society into what you want it to be doesn't make death worth it.

      ```
      When nations stagnate or approach catastrophic failure, that tends to result in armed conflict. Either because of internal pressures (riots, insurgencies, civil wars), ect) or external pressures (war). In any either case, if a nuclear power is involved, then there is a nonzero chance of a nuclear weapon being used and thus a nonzero chance of extinction.
