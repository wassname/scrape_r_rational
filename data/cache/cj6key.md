  Man i love the casual mentions of stuff of that happens in the background.

  But also what stops someone from getting the sigil vote and then immediately, or i suppose close to the end of nine years, killing the whole of their sigil?

  I can't wait to see where this leads also what the Hiearch what might think of an entire race of people made to act in a democratic fashion. It is kind of weird that all of the democratic nations are either tiered citizenships or straight on the Evil side of a literal Good-Evil axis.

    Wasn't basic Good-Evil premise for gods was that Good follows above, Evil decides for themselves?
    ```

      ```
      This exactly. "Good" here is defined as following the Will of Heaven, because the Gods Above believed that mankind needed to be shepherd by them. This authoritarian nature suits hierarchical governments since the Heavenly Mandate is a literal and verifiable thing.
      ```

      - u/anenymouse:
        ```
        But we also have Procer which has at this point politically neutered their priests and have a noticeable dearth of Named, and i'm not sure but i vaguely recall pre-Conquest Callow having their priesthood mostly being apolitical. I'm not sure that the Heavenly Mandate is particularly verifiable or at least we haven't seen the equivalent of Amadeus being stripped of his Name.
        ```

        - u/Amagineer:
          ```
          We totally saw a Lantern (one of Levant's superpriests) stripped of all their priest-juice when they tried to verify that the freshly ressurected Pilgrim wasn't secretly an undead abomination under the Black Queen's control.
          ```

            Oh yeah, man it must suck for that one guy to have the entirety of their training and whole existence made kind of irrelevant by one mistake. Wait do all priests in Guide-verse have the "priest-juice" in the first place? Are there non-healing priests that still keep the faith but are unable to actively use Godly power?
            ```

    - u/anenymouse:

      I mean in story you're not wrong, but as a person living in part of the democratic world it's weird that the Evil side is the democracy. Like i can't think of any other setting where some if not all of the democracies are, you know, evil.
      ```

      - u/werafdsaew:
        ```
        Again, Good/Evil is different thing than good/evil.
        ```

        Which is part of the fundamental contrast between our world and theirs, I personally love the look at democracy through the lens of, this is Evil and will almost definitely lead to abuses of the limited power given in order to maintain control of the masses. Democracy just kits the mild of evil in this world so well, because it means you have to 'fight' for a position, to prove you deserve it and have enough people agree for you to obtain it, like gaining an evil name. While gaining a Good name is just someone unilaterally saying, "I'm here to give you power and skill so you can do what I say." Which perfectly reflects the idea of the heaven ordained ruler.

    Nothing. They're now politicians.
    ```

  - u/RRTCorner:
    ```
    I guess the Losara Sigil will enforce the oaths, and any oath which wants to have a chance to be voted will include something like "I will not slaughter my whole sigil for personal gains".  
    Also there might be cabals formed to disincentivize this sort of behaviour. 

    Add to that that mighty don't actually gain much from killing someone much weaker it becomes pretty unappealing to actually do it. Sure you get to keep the Sigil-Holder-Level of power, but what use is this if you are not going to have sigil, bc nobody is going to follow you afterwards again.
    ```

    >But also what stops someone from getting the sigil vote and then immediately, or i suppose close to the end of nine years, killing the whole of their sigil?

    The same thing that stops them from doing it now. Dzulu have so little night that they're more useful just as embodied gophers and infantry than they are for harvested night. Kill all your dzulu and (especially with Cat's provision for switching sigils) you'll be left with not enough Night to solely defeat every other sigil and establish dominance, no dzulu willing to join your sigil, and probably the enmity of Sve "Let's maybe try not butchering each other this time" Noc.
    ```

  - u/Taborask:
    ```
    That's what the Losara sigil is for I suppose, to facilitate the transfer of Night, which probably entails claiming it from the reluctant
    ```

- u/Mountebank:
  ```
  So how enforceable are these oaths? If they're making oaths for things they plan to do, then like campaign promises what's stopping them from conveniently failing them after trying their "very best"? Will the oaths enforce a mental compulsion to make the follow through?
  ```

  - u/RUGDelverOP:
    ```
    Sve Noc probably rips the Night out of the offender on the spot. The Drow aren't dumb enough to treat oaths like a politicans campaign promise.
    ```

  - u/leakycauldron:
    ```
    Night ate Winter and Winter oaths had them die by ice spikes into their hearts or something, right?
    ```

    - u/Banarok:
      ```
      not spikes, it just froze solid.
      ```

- u/PastafarianGames:
  ```
  I wonder what the results will be of the concentration of power into the office rather than the Mighty themselves. Also, how will Sigils merge or die?

  (If you die while in office your power gets rolled into the Night that is the office, right? And this office is Sigil-specific. And you're in a war, where the office holders are battle resources...)
  ```

  - u/314kabinet:
    ```
    With this more and more power will roll into the office, never leaving it. They’d need to distribute it back every once in a while, otherwise the sigil’s entire supply of Night gets rolled into its office over the years.
    ```
