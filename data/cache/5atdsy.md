## [Challenge Companion] Politics

### Post:

**This is the companion thread for the biweekly challenge. Please post recommendations, story ideas, brainstorming, etc. in this thread.**

I love politics. Or rather, I hate politics, because it's horrible and toxic, but I love the play and counterplay of politics; so long as I'm viewing it more as a chess match and less like a decision making process, I end up enjoying the show. I also think that politics is one of the hardest things for a writer to get right, because there's a strong instinct to just write the other side off as stupid or ignorant without actually trying to pass some form of the ideological Turing test.

Politics in science fiction and fantasy holds more of a draw for me, because an author can create a new issue from whole cloth and then explore where the ideological (and political faction) lines can be drawn. It's fascinating to me to see political explorations of necromancy or human-brain interfaces ... and in my opinion, it doesn't really show up as often as it should.

(Apologies for the brief summary, it's National Novel Writing Month.)

  I would say that the difficulty in writing politics is making both sides look stupid and ignorant which is a lot more in line with the reality of politics in a non-rational populace. What's the need for coherent sensible politics when buzzwords and catchphrases do more work?

    "The natural modality for genuinely sophisticated literary exploration of morality is a conflict of Good vs. Good, played straight. A conflict between high ideals that the story doesn’t try to taint, to cast down, to use to showcase the author’s superior worldly cynicism—-for this does nothing but weaken the conflict."

    To me, that sounds like an oversimplification. The US political system certainly has many systemic problems that have become very apparent this election, but to write off the situation as "people are morons" is unproductive. What is productive is to understand why the system is the way it is due to what interests people are incentivized to pursue.

    Political campaigns aren't build on catchphrases, those are just marketing slogans designed to attract attention from potential voters so they might reconsider their position and also give current supporters a tribal identification to latch onto. It's easier for people to process, especially when they're distracted from politics by their own busy lives.

  Not exactly *politics* (rather anti-politics) but I think the idea of anarchy or anarcho-capitalism has potential in rational fiction. I keep waiting for a story where the 'Dark Lord' gets overthrown and isn't just replaced with another ruler, benevolent or not. The moral philosophy behind anarchy or voluntaryism is also quite rationalistic (empirical evidence aside, as there haven't exactly been a lot of functioning anarchistic societies) so I'm surprised I haven't at least seen something similar.

    Ancap =\= anarchy, and if you think the two are even similar you dont know what you're talking about.

    Also, if you're advocating for ancap you probably know roughly nothing about economics.

      Why not explain your point instead of just insulting me?

        The original definition of "anarchism" was left-anarchism, and there are good philosophical reasons why.  That is, if you're willing to use force to create and defend private property (as in "anarcho"-capitalism), then you're really just [going against your supposed anarchist principles to endorse primitive accumulation and its products](http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2012/04/yasha-levine-recovered-economic-history-everyone-but-an-idiot-knows-that-the-lower-classes-must-be-kept-poor-or-they-will-never-be-industrious.html).

        It would be *interesting* to do this bit of history *differently* in some fictional world, and perhaps see what the arrangement of factions would be if one side was *actually anarchist* (perhaps based on Sterner or Kropotkin, or just as Iain Banks fanfic), another side was *actually* anarcho-capitalist (they decided to encourage economic growth using this newfangled "market" thing they made up), and *another* side was actually trying to engage in primitive accumulation.

  or playing a few games of Crusader Kings 2 would be valuable as well.
