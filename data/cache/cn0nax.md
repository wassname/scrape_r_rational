  If anyone has any critiques or criticisms, I'm always interested in knowing all the ways in which I suck so I can stop sucking sooner. :)

    The world building and writing in general have been excellent quality, and I've been enjoying the story so far quite a bit.

    The "game" side of the quest has been much more difficult for me to enjoy so far. I think the latest changes to how we are constructing plans may help somewhat with that, and you've been better about setting expectations after the latest plan.

    I think my biggest issue is that we have been running into a lot of disagreements between players about the fundamentals of how game mechanics work, and I think that ultimately comes down to the mechanics themselves being vague and open ended.  I get the impression that your intent is for us to gradually learn more about the mechanics along with the story and setting through testing, but my observation thus far has been that these ambiguities in core mechanics are not fun for players to explore - they're just needlessly confusing and annoying.

    There are a couple levels to these vague mechanics. Some of them are clearly deliberate, like the unknown costs for applying marks and performing spell research.

    The other level are things like the descriptions of the spells we already have being unclear, such as how Sacrifice didn't work anything like how the players were reading it.

    I would advise you to address at *least* the second issue - vague tooltip for things we already can do. Personally, I consider it to be poor game design to give players abilities that are functionally very different from what their description implies. Similarly, I would advise adding use cases, especially for Research Magic.

    I don't think things like the unknown costs for marks are fun, either, but I suspect those are more of a conscious design decision that I simply disagree with. Perhaps a middle ground of giving us a clear mark cost if we spend a reasonable and clear void point amount would be a good middle ground.

    The "black box" style of approach to how things work doesn't appeal to me as a player - I prefer clear rules systems in general - so I have some biases here. That said, I think that other players are running into similar difficulties, and those difficulties are contributing toward making the game more confusing and less fun overall.

    I would like to thank you again for running the quest. Your writing is excellent, and your world has been fun to explore.

      Thanks for your feedback, and I'm glad you've enjoyed it (though the writing is all Vecht :) )

      Some of this is due to starting quest issues and a bit of communication issues on our end for which I apologize, and I believe will clear up as the story goes on (e.g. I hadn't fully stress tested Sacrifice at quest start). This should also be cleared up as we don't really intend to provide additional tooltips moving forward -- we expect the players to track the results of what they try and learn from them. If they want documented use cases, they can experiment with them to generate use cases.

      I suspect that the crux of the matter here is a difference of goals. Vecht and I are out to write a collaborative story with interesting characters, decisions, and planning which is supported by reasonable mechanics. We are not trying to make a set of clearly defined rules and ask people to find edge cases to hit the win button. If people want that sort of thing, they should play a video game instead of a quest -- computers track that sort of thing better, and a full team of developers will probably make a more robust set of rules than two people in their spare time. At the end of the day, we don't think the world works via video game logic and exploits, and we don't want that to dominate our story (which necessitates either being smart enough to remove literally every unintended edge case upfront (we've certainly tried, but are confident we've missed spots), or "black boxing" the mechanics so that the edge cases can be dealt with without significantly impact the story or player expectations).

      As an example of why we're doing it this way: In Marked for Death, explicit mechanics were written to explain how substitution worked. The QMs worked on it, and I discovered that this meant every ninja should be able to set off atomic scale warheads by the time they've got \~1 year of experience. This meant that we as players had it as a goal to go for that, but, when the QMs got around to modeling it, decided to change the mechanics so that this didn't happen. If substitution had been black boxed, the players wouldn't have pursued it, and there never would have been the disappointment, the feeling of being cheated out of something, or a disruption of the story due to issues in the way the game was set up. As another example, Marked for Death needed to revise their mechanics systems a few times. Ultimately, each time, players were very cognizant of relative increases and decreases in power, which were (at least to me) disruptive to the story and planning. By Black boxing these things, we limit player understanding of their power to what is viewed on screen, so the backend mechanics need only match up to what is shown, not what is extrapolated into edge cases. This, we believe, leads towards a more stable quest.

      I spoke with Radvic on this one. Our main feedback is that we're primarily writing a collaborative story, which the mechanics are intended to facilitate as your (the players') tendrils of agency within the world -- as opposed to running a game with a set of mechanics that the narrative is supposed to support.

      If you want a detailed set of clearly defined rules to exploit, that's what video games are for. If instead you want to participate in a simulation of a real world (insofar as it is possible to do that with fiction), it just doesn't work that way. You don't have access to the rules of physics underlying reality in real life, and almost all of the knowledge we take for granted has been earned through centuries of extremely intelligent people bashing their heads against a natural world that is wholly unmoved by their frustration. That isn't to say we want you to be frustrated, or that we're expecting that level of commitment to unearthing hidden secrets; only that you're going to have to work a lot harder than you have been if you want to be rewarded with deeper knowledge of how magic works.

      To be fair, the first infopost says explicitly at the very top: "Note: just as you do not have explicit access to the mechanics which govern real life, you will not have explicit access to the mechanics which govern events in the story -- you will need to determine what works, what doesnâ€™t, and how to improve based on your own experimentation, progress, and ingenuity." I'll grant that we could probably be clearer on this front so as to avoid misunderstandings and frustration. Some of this is on us. But to be fair, I've said as much on multiple occasions (which you yourself have correctly pointed out in thread).

      I think most of this might be bourne from some kind of perception on some of the players' part that the world is much more shallow than it actually is, coupled with a general aversion to being openly *wrong* about things when there is so much uncertainty -- that is, judging by a few responses I've seen in the thread. It certainly isn't the case across the board. One or two players have made extremely accurate and astute observations in theorycrafting posts (even if most of the same theorycrafting has been wrong -- which is to be expected). I'm not sure what else I can say on that front besides "no -- there's a reason it took me and Radvic over 2 years of working on and off behind the scenes before I was comfortable starting the quest."

      Additionally: while we certainly don't *not* want our players to have fun, ensuring every possible method of interaction with the quest is fun isn't exactly on the top of our priorities. We *absolutely do want* player interaction to be deeply rewarding and engaging. But that's only going to happen if you actually engage with the story on a deeper level, rather than dragging your heels and expecting spoon-fed results from pulling the mechanics levers in the right way. I half-expect to get downvoted for saying this, but I'm not going to own the mistakes of my players if they believe they can interact with the story in a shallow and confused fashion and expect anything but shallow and confusing results in response. Think of it this way. If I gave you a budget of $10k and said "go figure out the fliglebloog effect from the gargablag artifact which you only know about from a description in a story that might not even be based on anything real," how much progress are you going to make on that?

      With Research Magic in particular, you (the players) have thus far chose to spend your limited VP in very shallow ways (that is, directing Fi to research something out of folklore and legend and giving her a small, fixed budget). As has been communicated (and again, perhaps this should have been made clearer), Fi isn't going to be able to make much progress on research without (1) a *really* solid idea of how the magic is supposed to work, including its mechanisms of action and limitations, or (2) a working example to draw from. A lot of stuff just isn't going to be possible -- and further, the players haven't seem to even acknowledge that fact despite me saying so on multiple occasions. Direct quote shortly after Chapter 3: "Oh also, some of those legends Zelda referenced may or may not be pure bunk. Or they might all contain the barest nuggets of truth. Or they could all just be fanciful stories and scary tales. Or maybe I just want to screw with you and you should disregard this message. Or maybe it's all 100% real. Who knows." I think there's even been an IC response from Fi (though I might be confusing things) to the effect of saying that any VP spent on research isn't guaranteed to result in anything at all.

      The ability is there, and you may use it. That doesn't mean you have to, or that you're expected to, or that you'll need to right away if you want to make progress. Ultimately, figuring all this out is up to you (the players).

      All that said, I want to thank you for your honest and open feedback. Unless it isn't absolutely clear: both I and Radvic are heavily committed to making this quest a rewarding and engaging experience for our players, and we care very much about fixing and addressing problems that crop up. We've talked about these issues and if nothing else we'll certainly keep them in mind as we move forward.
