  Oh, wow, Turry! With Emma's raised eyebrow at being so accurately called out. It really seems that Emma has gone over the deep end in the last two chapters. Now she's conspiring with Turry because who knows why.

    I think Turry was speaking to how they would be perceived if they tried to reveal his existence, as a call back to how she was treated previously.
