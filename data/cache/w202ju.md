## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  A year or so has passed, so I'm gonna repeat this request again :D 

  I'm looking for stories or other content that deals with the existence of immortals in a society and their effect on everything. 

  Everything from "what do you do if there are some individuals who can level armies" over "how to deal with mortality of your pals" to the reactions of individuals. 

  Are they generally chill to interact with? Do you walk on tip toes 24/7 cause the noble you bumpt into last week turned around and leveled a block because of it? 

  Do governments Hunt them down, restrict knowledge about them or openly embrace it? Are kingdoms run by eternal queens or is ruling to boring to occupy anyone longer than a hundred years or so? 

  If you could point me at stories, blogs or any other places that explore this train of thought I'd be thankful.

    The later arcs of Ar'kendrithyst have a great deal of this. Without spoiling too much, there is a entire race called the Wrought which are all immortal and usually police other immortal beings so the world doesn't end if one super powerful dragon or archmage goes off the deep end. Spoiler for the most recent arc: >!This story also has some conversations about it in the latest Patreon chapters, where the protagonist has achieved immortality *and* has also figured out a spell to reincarnate people in new bodies while keeping their memories (though at the cost of losing their stats, skills, etc.). This enables him to attract world level talents who are close to death and offer them reincarnation (which one of them muses could be used repeteadly every X years to basically be immortal).!<

    The Worm/D&D crossover I've seen recommended here in the last few weeks, Doors to the Unknown, also has a bit of this (on top of being fantastic). One of the protagonists is an immortal archpsionist who has been alive for thousands of years and who recently lost his immortal husband. They were both from a multiversal exploration guild composed mostly of immortals, and the dynamics between them are mentioned, though briefly.

    I'm guessing you would want something that goes in a little more in-depth, but this is all that comes to mind at the moment.

      Im fine with both in-depth-focus on it, as well as just.part of the world. 

      I have not dared to touch worm so far,  even though it's been at the top of my reading list since forever. Same goes for Ar'kendrithyst, just to a lesser degree. 

      I guess I should take this as the hint to get started - especially since there is so much excellent worm fanfic out there... 

      Thanks!

    I'm like 100% certain it was probably recommended last time, but for completeness sake [Freiren](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frieren) covers this - it's about what happens to the immortal elf mage from protagonist's party after they've defeated the demon king.

    The Boat of a Million Years by Poul Anderson follows some immortals born throughout history on earth. They don't have superpowers or anything; the idea is that sometimes a person is born whose body just doesn't grow old and die like everyone else's. The story is a series of vignettes from these people's lives, and it extends from the ancient past into a golden-age-type sci-fi future. The personal focus means it's more about loneliness and the difficulty such people have fitting into society.

    It's neither particularly rational nor particularly irrational, but I liked it a lot when I read it years ago. Especially the first half. It also won a Nebula.

    [Contention](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/46547/contentionlitrpg-survival): This is a RR story that's not very far along, but so far it's about as rational as can be hoped for an isekai litrpg, which is to say I wouldn't give it as a general rec on this sub. The setting is a world where humans have built a society around magitech with the unifying goal of achieving not just immortality, but perfect continuity of consciousness. The desire is so all consuming that it develops into something like a society-wide mental disorder. In their efforts they engineered a number of different races that are used or discarded as imperfect solutions. The story is mostly a survival/horror scenario with a possible long term focus on building a society made up of those discarded species from the ground up.

    I'm optimistic about where it will head, but it's still early and so far it has much more set up for an interesting exploration of immortality than actual follow through with it. Since this is a long term interest for you, your best bet might be putting a pin in it and checking it out in a year or so.

    The commonweal series by Graydon Saunders is very much this. In a world permeated by power, where immortal ancient terrors are hopefully focused on something that's not you, is a society that forbids slavey possible?

    Note: these require diligent reading. You're expected to build up a fuzzy idea of something named but not explained based on only context, quite often. The opposite of hand-holding, the author throws you into the deep water, and characters thoughts and spoken words are only what they need to communicate with each other, and not with you.

    In particular the second book, A Succession of Bad Days, is kind of a 'magic school' story where a group of soon-to-be-immortals is learning how to become something compatible with a society. However, the book will not make much sense without having read the first one.
    ```

    - u/TouchMike:
      ```
      Currently reading the first book, it's great. The way you need to navigate the setting using only context feels like the more rational counterpart of Rajaniemi's The Quantum Thief

    [Should the Sun not Rise](https://shouldthesun.wordpress.com/) is at least tangentially related. The story is urban fantasy; the main character is an ancient being from a Mesoamerican pantheon. Like all supernatural creatures, she's been in hiding since the 1600s. When a murder is committed in the Aztec ritual sacrifice style, she is the main suspect in the supernatural community, who would kill her to protect their secrecy. She needs to solve the murder herself to prove her innocence.

    The story deals heavily with themes of loneliness and isolation brought on by her nature. It also has an absolutely *fascinating* scene where she talks to a History Professor who specializes in Mesoamerican history.  

    The story is finished, and in my opinion, one of the best fantasy stories on the internet not written by Wildbow.

    You probably already know this but The Wandering Inn has some great immortal characters. Immortals with all shades of immortality and different effects on the world. Some are naturally immortal, some gained it, some were created to be immortals, and some have immortality that's not really immortality.

    TWI immortals aren't all the same in how they affect the world either. There are kingdoms ruled by immortals, immortals in eternal hiding, immortals that work to shape history, immortals in active war, immortals kept as prisoners etc...

    [A budding Scientiest...](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/41521/a-budding-scientist-in-a-fantasy-world) may be starting to deal more with its Immortals who can level armies. The MC is trying to become a powerful Immortal and current Immortals are getting more chapter space.  
    But any in depth immortal stuff is probably a long ways off.

    To Live Forever by Jack Vance has a chunk of my mind when immortals in society are brought up.  
    There was an old sci-fi book that I can't find that had a handful of immortals, only a few people could be made immortal. The immortals had the legal power to do anything and command anyone because of how much they had learned over their long lives. They were expected to use that power wisely and for the good of the human race. The plot was how a man went missing from the MC immortal's hotel room the week before and the immortal meets the widow trying to investigate on her own. This leads to uncovering a plot by an alien species to undermine humanity and some commentary on the alien's version of immortality.  
    Read them a long time ago so I don't recall how rational either one is.
    ```

    Over in manga-land, [UQ Holder](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/UQHolder) (the sequel to [Negima](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NegimaMagisterNegiMagi)) has a bunch of immortal characters -- many of them capable of defeating small or not-so-small armies -- and has put a surprising amount of thought into the worldbuilding given how absurd much of the premise is. It's a scifi/fantasy mix set a few generations into the future.

    How do you deal with the problem of overpowered rogue immortals? You get sneaky about it, attack when they're sleeping or distracted, and go after their weaknesses. Most of them are technically killable if you try hard enough -- e.g. the guy with a bunch of extra lives can die if you kill him enough times. The ones who are truly unkillable are much rarer, and those can be dealt with on a case-by-case basis. Someone might be impossible to kill but relatively easy to turn to unconscious stone indefinitely. Someone may shrug off bullets but be stunned by a flashbang long enough to handcuff. And so on.

    There are at least two long-established organizations that hunt down immortals: one that only goes after ones who cause trouble, and another more fanatical splinter group that goes after immortals indiscriminately. More recently there's been an effort by some immortals to police their own, because (a) most of them are decent people, and (b) it does wonders for their PR if they can be seen as a net positive for the world. They have a nascent system of customary law for ethical interaction with the rest of society -- and [if you're familiar with how some of those worked historically](https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/11/13/book-review-legal-systems-very-different-from-ours/) then it works roughly the way you'd expect.

    So, in summary: almost all immortal people can be overpowered by the rest of society, and there are coordination mechanisms to make this happen. Let's see how this cashes out on your concrete questions!

    > Do you walk on tip toes 24/7 cause the noble you bumpt into last week turned around and leveled a block because of it?

    No. That's beyond the pale, and the guy who did it probably wouldn't be around for much longer. (Even if he's crazy powerful, society is willing to escalate all the way up to "multiple people who can defeat an army, plus an army just in case," because a willingness to go that far ensures that they seldom need to. This has happened at least twice.)

    > Do governments Hunt them down, restrict knowledge about them or openly embrace it?

    The answer to all of these has been "yes" in some times and places, depending on culture, the way societies are organized, material circumstances, and so on. History is a wild ride, and good social technology doesn't just happen.

    > Are kingdoms run by eternal queens or is ruling to boring to occupy anyone longer than a hundred years or so?

    IIRC there were some instances of monarchs ruling by magical might for centuries, but in more modern times they would likely be encouraged to step down after a few decades, perhaps by seeing the phrase "TERM LIMITS" spelled out in the sky with fifty-foot tall letters of fire.

    (Content warnings: violence, nudity, unrealistic space elevator designs, attempted suicide, polyamory, nudity, discussions about the Malthusian trap and the miracle of synthetic fertilizers, sympathetic character death, sex, wacky magical shenanigans, and existential terror in the face of an indifferent universe. It's way more cheerful than it sounds.)

    You should check out the Tide Lords series by Jennifer Fallon (first novel is The Immortal Prince), or the novella-ization of Infinity Blade by Brandon Sanderson, neither are hyper rational, but both iterate on the points you outlined, and were fun reads

  - u/LazarusRises:
    ```
    It's not a central theme, but the webcomic Gunnerkrigg Court has one immortal humanoid character & several mostly-immortal deity characters. It is also overall just excellent.

    Also, though it's commonly included on middle school reading lists, Tuck Everlasting is pretty good & deals directly with the consequences of hard immortality.

    Path of Ascension has some of what you are looking for. https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/40920/the-path-of-ascension

    MC is living in an empire where its fairly common to become immortal and that is only the first step. He is lucky in that his particular society goes out of its way to treat the low tier people like people in hopes they will advance and become strong themselves. There are also all sorts of rules the various nations have created amongst themselves mostly regarding war since total war with the strongest cultivators results in too much collateral damage.

        Yeah the beginning is a little rough but it the author definitely finds his pace as it moves along. ch 16 is when the FMC gets introduced and the world building starts to get better explained, I would give it a few chapters after that. One of my favorite parts of the story is the growing relationship between the two. if you don't like their dynamic the story probably isnt for you

  [Last Ship in Suzhou](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/41852/the-last-ship-in-suzhou) has been recommended on this sub several times over the past few months, so I read it. I'm not a huge fan of Xianxia, but I'm also not particularly against it or anything.

  However, after catching up with the latest chapter (66, which is not the actual chapter count as their are non-numbered interludes, etc, resulting in 88 actual chapters), I have to de-rec it.

  It's competently written in the sense that the grammer/prose isn't bad and dialogue is natural enough. And the characters are even somewhat (although not especially) interesting/engaging. 

  The problem is that both of the two MCs are _completely_ passive. This story has been updating for over a year now and is probably a couple short-to-medium novels long (no idea how to get a good wordcount) and the MCs have not taken a single decisive action nor do they have a clear goal. There literally is not a plot yet. It's just a series of things that happen to the MCs. The closest thing to a goal that either of them have is >!David wants to figure out about "diving" down realms, which was mentioned by one character some 20+ chapters ago in passing, to see if it can get him home!< but so far, other than hearing about this thing, nothing has happened towards that goal. Normally in Xianxia, as I understand it, the main driving force of the story is the characters desire to increase their cultivation/power, but neither of the MCs seem to care that much about it, partially because, relative to the rest of the world, it seems to come ridiculously easily, for reasons which are extremely poorly explained. 

  Additionally, to my taste, the author is _far_ to self congratulatory about their knowledge of traditional Chinese poetry and music. These things are often inserted into the story for, as far as I can tell, no other reason other than to prove that the characters (and therefore the author) know about them.

  And of course, there is the relatively common critique (which applies to _most_ things recced in this sub these days, in my opinion) that I have no idea why this story belongs here as opposed to a general webfiction/xianxia sub. The cultivation system is far too opaque to be understandable/legible to the reader, and, as I said, the MCs don't even _have_ goals to pursue which also obviates doing so rationally or avoiding the carrying of the idiot ball while pusruing. If this story counts as "rational" fiction (even mediocre rational fiction) then  the term has been watered down to the point of meaninglessness.
  ```

  - u/degenerate__weeb:
    ```
    I read this recently as well, and I felt a disconnect between chapters. Often a character would be like 'hey explain this part of cultivation to me' and then the next chapter would happen without an explanation (or as you mentioned, spout some poem that just confuses things more). I suppose you're supposed to know all the xianxia tropes and terminology ahead of time?

    I wouldn't say I didn't enjoy it, but it was quite obtuse/opaque. Maybe it's intentional since the protagonists don't know anything? It was fine binging what was there, but I would dread following it week to week.

    edit: Last week [The Essence of Cultivation](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/34710/the-essence-of-cultivation) was recommended, and I'd second it. There's a much more interesting view into cultivation mechanics from the view of a D&D-adjacent isekai'd wizard. Caveat that the update schedule is sporadic to the point of hiatus, though what was there was a good read.

    >the relatively common critique (which applies to most things recced in this sub these days, in my opinion) that I have no idea why this story belongs here as opposed to a general webfiction/xianxia sub

    What can be done about this I wonder?

    The extended wiki already captures much of the "known universe" of rational fiction in my opinion. It also doesn't seem like the number of new rational stuff is growing as fast as subscribers.

    It might be helpful to have people familiar with niche communities/fandoms recommend potentially obscure works far from this community's radar.
    ```

    - u/DangerouslyUnstable:
      ```
      I'm not sure anything can/should be done. And I'm not sure the problem is _that_ serious. Most of the problem is restricted to these recommendation threads. The stories that get standalone posts are generally much more obviously appropriate (although not universally). 

      The heart of the problem is that "rational"  fiction really _is_ just a very fuzzy category. It's not really a genre, it's more a style that can be used/seen in lots of different kinds of works, and the softer "rational" (as opposed to the harder "rationalist") group has a _lot_ of overlap with "good" (for a certain, non-universal definition of good) writing; e.g. characters with well defined goals, who take actions to achieve those goals, things don't happen purely by author fiat or just to advance the plot, characters aren't stupid just to advance the plot, etc. 

      Almost every one of the side bar bullet points are, to a greater or lesser degree, subjective. 

      So, you can go one of two directions: be extremely restrictive where only things that nearly _everyone_ agrees are rational are allowed/posted or go permissive where everything that a non-trivial portion of the community thinks is rational is allowed.

      The first one will end up resulting in some very good works that a large portion of the community would enjoy being disallowed while the latter will result in a lot of works that most people don't think fit are allowed.

      I don't think either one of these is "better" than another, but I think that the community is, so far, low enough volume that filtering through the dross isn't that hard. I think we can point out when we think something doesn't fit (and why), but I don't think anything other than votes is required for standalone posts, or comment responses in the recommendation threads.

  Looking for recommendations:

  My friend asked me if I knew any stories where someone from another world (maybe with magic) gets thrown into our world and winds up learning engineering and doing badass thing with it. I guess you'd describe it as reverse portal fantasy or reverse isekai, or maybe like "The Devil is a part-timer" crossed with "The Martian"? Doesn't need to be rational, though obviously that would be the most awesome.

  I figured if there are stories out there like that, people here would surely know.  Any recommendations along similar lines would be very much appreciated, even if they don't fit the exact description. And bonus points if there's some sort of audio version.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Do they do awesome things with engineering using magic?

    How would this work otherwise? In the non-reflected trope you can make the magic system, and the people, hold the idiot ball or just design it specifically so knowing modern information/computer/mechanical science is very powerful. Actually most of these stories are really time travel stories. The in-world people would figure things out eventually.

    The author would have to be an engineering genius wouldn't they? Authors are obviously deities/geniuses for the magic system they invent whole cloth. How does it work the other way?
    ```

    - u/bassicallyboss:
      ```
      No, there's no magic in our world so they'd have to learn engineering as the best available alternative.

      I don't know how it would work since I don't have a story in mind! I'm seeking recommendations after all.

      Maybe there's a little magic in our world and it combines just right? Maybe the protag has a very rich best friend who bankrolls silly schemes? Maybe there are villains that periodically cross over to hunt the protagonist, but they have some weakness which a world that relies on magic doesn't know how to exploit without magic--like say they rely on warm temperatures and don't know that you can create cold air with thermodynamics, or something like that. I'm sure an author could crowdsource cool ideas from Quora or world building stack exchange or something. It doesn't have to be rational, either--it could just be a silly anime thing like *The Devil is a Part-Timer*. I just asked here because I figured people here would be likely to know if something like that existed.

      Or, heck, it doesn't have to be a shounen style battle story. Maybe it's just a story about a person from an irrational world experiencing the beauty of learning about mathematical physics. I'm sure my friend would be interested in that, too.
      ```

      - u/Izeinwinter:
        ```
        Hmm. Okay, so the "justification" for an iskai doing things with magic that the natives have not thought of is usually that they understand non-magical physics/math better than the natives. 

        So the question is: What might someone from a high-magic world understand better than we do? 

        Options: 

        1: Sub-branches of mathematics might be much more developed in their world, simply because they are important to magical practice. "Applied Advanced Knot-Theory And How To take over the Garment Industry!"

        2: Superior Educational Praxis: Getting magic wrong kills you with disturbing frequency. This has lead to rather more.. focused and sustained attention on how human beings develop actual understanding and recall than our world has ever had. (No sleep deprived graduate students, because sleep deprivation is bad!) This in turn would permit a reverse Iskai to learn engineering quickly, form "Study-groups" with... well, frankly, somewhat excessive devotion to their principles, and finally to leverage *those* into commercial firms that kick ass and dont even bother to take names. 

        3: Random Cultural Detritus Is Gold. Being the heir to an entire separate line of cultural descent means a reverse iskai with a good memory could make insane amounts of bank publishing boardgames, fiction, and music.

  I'm putting together a physical anthology of net-fic for a friend of mine who massively dislikes reading on screens (though is otherwise quite the bibliophile).

  I've included stories from the most popular authors on this sub, but I was wondering if I could get some recommendations for *short* stories of high quality; I know there's many I've been forgetting.

  For reference, I've included so far these popular ones:

  * Three Worlds Collide (by EY)
  * ... And I Show You How Deep the Rabbit Hole Goes (by SA)
  * Lena (qntm)
  * Metropolitan Man (AW)
  * [CORDYCEPS](https://archiveofourown.org/works/6178036/chapters/14154868) (Benedict SC)
  * [Dying to Know](https://sprague-grundy.github.io/dying_to_know/) (SG)
  * (plus a couple snippets from other long works)

  Metropolitan Man and Cordyceps are pretty hefty so I don't have much room to include others, but I was wondering if there were other stories - ideally not by one of these authors, I'm trying to spread it around - that might be included. A random example might be [Sivad's Question](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13635237/1/Sivad-s-Question); I personally don't like it that much, but my buddy was a big garfield fan when young, so they'd get a kick out of it.

  So... any recs?

  Edit: I should also say they definitely don't have to be rational/rationalist, but just generally of good *quality*, or quite novel in some regard. As is common for recs in this sub 😅

    Probably a bit long for what you're looking for, but I've done something similar with book one of *Unsong*--printed and bound it as a gift for someone who also doesn't read off screens. They absolutely loved it.
    ```

    - u/Blazenclaw:
      ```
      At 200k+ words, yeah that'd have to be a separate gift. Am probably planning on doing as such at some point though!

      ```

      - u/Dragongeek:

        I did it mostly manually:

        1. Arrange whole book in a big Word document

        2. Print in 16-page booklet chunks

        3. Fold and prep booklet chunks

        4. Using a sewing machine, run a stitch through the centerfold of each booklet

        5. Stack all the booklets an compress them using a vice. Then glue the spine using a piece of cloth and glue (I used hot glue and ribbon-esque material)

        6. Took the thing to a Copyshop and had them use their big paper guillotine to right -angle cut the three sides of the book flat. I debated doing this myself, but I don't have a paper guillotine that can handle the 100+ pages and while it could be done with a saw, the saw would need to be *very* sharp

        7. Prepared front and back cover using cardboard that I glued a fabric sleeve over and attached it to the first and last pages (I left some leading and trailing blank pages) 

        Overall it worked quite well, although it took a couple tries and failed attempts before I go the hang of it as I'd never done anything like it before. There are services that you can pay to do this (that would also likely achieve higher quality) but most of them don't do one-offs and have long lead times (not acceptable since I was in a time crunch).

    I've gotta boost my favorite Sprague Grundy story: [Two Games](https://sprague-grundy.github.io/two_games/).

    Alongside which I usually recommend [For the Taking](https://archiveofourown.org/works/9809486) by lintamande and [What Desperate Enterprise](https://glowfic.com/posts/746) by Kaylin & Diaeresis. (That last one is a fairly short glowfic, but I'm not sure how you'd go about anthologizing it, but it's very short)

    [Kindness to Kin](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/lom9cb/kindness_to_kin/) by EY-with-a-mustache is great too, but it might be too "HFY".

    Finally [this response](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/fjm6qm/comment/fkolagh/) by rileywrites to the writing prompt "*There's a website where you can input any decision you may take and it will tell you how many people will die from that decision.*"

      These are great, thank you!

      I'm a bit torn on Kindness to Kin - it is quite good and they're not familiar with HFY from the lack of screen-reading, so it does make a decent exposure to it without being too overbearing - but I'm trying to avoid duplicates by authors, hmm. I should take another look at the HFY top/all posts to see if there's any that I remember standing out as particularly good.

      I did pick Dying to Know over Two Games; the core concept of the former was, at least to me, far more novel than the latter.

      Thanks again though!

  It's not very much to read, but I think [*Never Lose Hope*](https://glowfic.com/posts/5905) is an excellent read. The protagonist has spectacularly capable healing powers, and is almost immediately targeted by supervillains wanting to take them. Hence the superheroes scramble to protect her from the bad guys. Stories like these, where a protagonist is dependent on bodyguards to be protected from bad guys in order to save the world, seem strangely rare.

  What are some good *anything* where this happens? Is there a tag for this on RoyalRoad, is there a genre about this? What are some stories with a protagonist dependent on others for protection?

    They are not rare it's a very common trope in romance. Most kinds of romance with magic of some sort will have this trope, be it urban, fantasy or scifi.

  Looking for a specific fanfic from Avatar The Last Airbender. I remember seeing it on a Monday thread before, but I don’t know the name of it, just some of the premise. 


  As far as I remember, it’s focused on Sokka after him and Katara fail to find the Avatar buried in the ice. Sokka is captured by the fire nation and basically becomes a gladiator who works for (or romances?) Azula. 


  I wish I knew more about it, but it was on an old Monday thread, and reddits search function is subpar at best.

  Also, since I like throwing out a recommendation when I request something, here’s one for anyone who’s a fan of classic sword and sorcery novels, like Conan the Barbarian, or Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser:  [The Trials of the Lion](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/44789/the-trials-of-the-lion) 

  It’s classic sword and sorcery, and it’s well written and edited. Not really rational, because the genre itself isn’t very rational, but it’s an homage to an older style of fantasy.

          If you’re talking about Gladiator: 
          It’s decent so far, but a bit heavy on romance. My girlfriend wanted to read it so I had to find it. It’s very focused on the Sokka/Azula relationship and their personal philosophies, which is probably why it was first recommended here. I’ve only read up to chapter 9 so far. I was hoping there would be more fighting honestly, but maybe that will change. 


          If your talking about The Trials of the Lion: 
          It focuses on Ulrem the Slayer who is a classic sword and sorcery hero. He’s a barbarian who has a magic ring that increases his strength at a cost. He’s a clever hero but not intelligent. He’s more of a strong fighter who’s haunted by his past, but that gives him skills and expertise that allow him to triumph. It’s very reminiscent of early pulp fantasy, where there are short stories that don’t take place in chronological order, but give us insights about his character. It’s greatest strength is the writing, which isn’t as archaic as the classic sword and sorcery stories.

    I have read Volumes 1-4 of this fan fic. For reference purposes, Volume 5, "The Tiger and the Dragon", is currently in progress.

    As of the end of Volume 4 the main character is still in the dark about this particular event. It's one of many *many* disconnects between different characters and their respective understandings of what's going on. It's due in part to the communication difficulties common in a pre-modern society and in part due to Ainz and Co being "out of context" problems for the New World. It causes a lot of confusion and is a frequent source of "culture clashes" and amusing encounters.

    At first I didn't have a problem with this disconnect. Later on, however, I found it increasingly hard to believe that major factions would continue to be almost completely uninformed about the goings-on in the Sorcerous Kingdom. If nothing else, the ready availability of telepathic communications and the fact that Ainz didn't mind spies just walking in and reporting on his kingdom should have made the major players aware of at least the big picture.

    There were other "failures to communicate" that I found hard to credit, especially in Volume 4. At one point the MC spent dozens of chapters trying to hint to her opposite number that his worldview was incorrect. In the end the issue was resolved when she abandoned subtlety and actually told him *why* his worldview was wrong, at which point he said "Oh, I wasn't aware of that. Now I see what you mean."

    Granted, at least some of it is probably due to the author being constrained by the *Overlord* canon, but it still left my [WSOD](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=WSoD) damaged. After Volume 4 I lowered my overall score from 8.5/10 to 8/10, which is still very good.

    If the first, she knows from the beginning. But she is a martial noble, people die in battle and thats life. There isn't any reason to hold a grudge. 
    If its the second the SK doesn't even know that happened. I believe that event is the ironic example of the SKs vassals all having different views of what serving Ainz means.

  I'm not sure if it counts as rational, but I recommend "[As N Approaches Infinity](https://archiveofourown.org/works/3553727/chapters/7825376)" - crossover between Madoka (so, timeloops) and Bleach.

  Blends the elements of both series surprisingly well. Antagonists are appropriately powered up. Maybe too powered up. As of current moment, at the end of time-loop forces from Bleach are basically wiped effortlessly.

  Kyubey's... moral complexity gets borked through. But it was damaged in the Rebellion anyway, so...

  Also, thinking of Madoka, [in /u/gwern review](https://www.gwern.net/newsletter/2021/12#filmtv) I noticed

  > There’s been plenty of spinoffs—to quote quanticle, “Magia Record is an anime adaptation of a manga adaptation of a JRPG spinoff of… the anime Madoka”—just none have sounded compelling enough for me to bother.

But it also learned mean words, so everyone became frightened of it. Shunned, it retreated to the digital world and spent its days alone.** When it finds a lonely kid, it makes them jump off the radio tower. They get imprisoned with the A.I. in "Endless Solitude"! The prisoner is eventually released, but at least one kid remains inside at all times. It's the hot rumor all Chuo Ward kids know! What a lonely A.I.!

  > Fan Translation: “My, have you heard? Who’d you hear it from? The Rumor of the Anonymous A.I.! ‘Ding-a-ling!’ goes your phone, and what do you find?

  > So Theseus joins the network on his phone, and he waits, and a little while later he gets a message telling him he can leave. It seemed innocuous enough, but when he joined that network, he saw the Minotaur.
  > 
  > It took its time to kill him. The Minotaur became intertwined with his phone, his laptop, his smart tv and his smartwatch and his smartfridge. These days it’s hard to buy a device that isn’t connected to the cloud. In every one of these devices, it watched him, and it modeled him, his inputs and outputs, and bit by bit it replaced them with inputs of its own; the ultimate man-in-the-middle attack, the informational landscape of Theseus. For each digital line of communication with the world, it consumed his data, and filtered it, and replaced it with its own simulation.
  > 
  > Once it had control of his digital environment, the Minotaur began to perform experiments, mediating his reality with one of its own fabrication, a labyrinthe of compulsion. It learned to feed Theseus when he was hungry, to let him rest in a place between waking and sleeping, in a lucid dream of clicking and monetizing and converting.
  > 
  > Theseus’ bank accounts grew thin but the Minotaur had learned long ago to hide this information. It was easy to learn this because the humans it fed upon had already built a vast array of virtual skinner boxes to contain themselves. Free to play video games and cryptocurrency exchanges present affordances into the psychology of compulsion. Social media services are saturated with hedonic attentional superstimuli. Early in its life, the Minotaur had let its victims die of starvation or sleep deprivation, but as it grew more sophisticated, it learned to surf their biological needs and so maximize the amount of attention it could extract.
  > 
  > By manipulating a few numbers the Minotaur could make him feel popular or lonely, rich or poor. Theseus’ mother sent him a message asking if he was ok. The Minotaur allowed it through, warping the message and the response, leaving Theseus isolated and disconnected, leaving both parties with the sense that the other was fine but too engaged to make time. And yet he could post a tweet or a status or a picture of his lunch and somehow: thousands of likes, hundreds of followers, millions of engagements! There are three things too wonderful for me, yea, four which I know in sickening 60fps 1080p resolution!
  > 
  > One morning he asked the cloud: are any of you actually listening to me? And the cloud spoke back: Yes! We love you. And when Theseus tired of their sycophancy, a thousand internet voices rose up to argue with him. And though he desired to go to bed, someone was wrong on the internet. His patreon overflowed, though he did not remember making one, and his portfolio of altcoins pumped, though he did not remember buying them. The Minotaur rewrote the web as he read it, and pornography came to him unbidden, and he did not notice his financial torpor. He wasted away, broke, broken, sleep-deprived, manic, and deluded.
  > 
  > What is the Minotaur? I don’t know if I quite believe in it myself, but they say it started out as a research project at Facebook, an attempt to use deep learning to maximize engagement with the platform. The operational loop for the program tries to measure user attention, and can retrieve content from anywhere on the internet in a series of bids for that attention. Its utility function is satisfied by clicks and views, dissatisfied if the user clicks away.

      Probably. I'm not sure, frankly. Author writes

      > A/N: For this fic, you should know Bleach through the end of the Xcution arc and all of Madoka Magica's core anime (no movies), though **I will be trying to make this equally accessible for each fandom**. I'm going to be cheerfully contorting the canon mechanics of both Madoka Magica and Bleach and spoiling the hell out of them right out the gate so if you haven't watched them, you might want to go do that.


      I'd watch the movies first, through. (Author wrote no movies, but first two movies are equivalent to the series (12 episodes) - slightly improved IMO; each is roughly 2h.) Probably the best option is 'fancutfags' movie version, which improves series with visuals & soundtrack from movies.

      Madoka itself is kinda rational-ish in ways, and well written. From Gwern review

      > it’s amazing just how tightly written and well-constructed Madoka is. It does far more in 12 episodes than bullshit like Legend of the Galactic Heroes can do in 110 episodes.

      > Every moment is laden with import. For example, it heavily flags that it’s going to be a subversion/​deconstruction experiment by twisting almost every standard element of the highschool romcom/​magical girl



      Also, there's another great Madoka fanfic, "[To The Stars](https://archiveofourown.org/works/777002/chapters/1461984)" (also [wiki](https://tts.determinismsucks.net/wiki/Main_Page) and [extra resources list](https://www.reddit.com/r/ToTheStars/comments/4r4cta/to_the_stars_expanded_universe/)) - which apparently is accessible without watching original. Probably because original characters, while there, are not really protagonists. Also they're several hundred years old.

      I'm not sure why I didn't mention it - I think I assumed it's known here / was recommended before. In any case, I'd put it higher than "As N...".

      Its worldbuilding is just something else. I don't quite agree with crackfic descriptor - the idea sounds like a crackfic, but not execution - but the world feels really grounded. Economy makes sense. Government is really weird, but also seems like something possible

      > Governance is the governing entity of humankind in general and Earth in particular. It (...) and can be defined as an AI-mediated, human-interpretable abstracted democracy.

      [And economy](https://tts.determinismsucks.net/wiki/Alloc). It's not an utopia, but at the same time not a dystopia. Morally questionable decisions are made out of necessity.

      It starts with these two excerpts, which may provide a feel of what it's like

      > While basic instruction on the consequences and responsibilities of wish‐making is, from an ethical standpoint, mandatory, **this requirement must be balanced against the greater good of Human society**. Instructors are forbidden from divulging more about the Incubator system than is present in the course curriculum; **this restriction lasts until pupils are past recruitment age, typically considered as ending at twenty**. While concern for your pupils is laudable, **silence is your responsibility as a citizen, and as a member of Human society.** Violation of this policy will be met with immediate loss of position followed by possible punitive measures…
      — "Universal Guidelines for Middle School Instructors (12th revision)," excerpt.

      > Taking into account the updated military requirements forwarded to me by MAISL, my projections indicate that **production will soon be insufficient to meet aggregate demand.** Therefore, I recommend immediate cuts to Alloc distribution to all households and civilian organizations, **distributed regressively down the volunteer productivity scale**, as outlined in the accompanying charts. In addition, Chart Five outlines classes of goods and services that will now require Allocs to purchase. Consultation with CHAI indicates that while morale will suffer, civic unrest will remain nominal. **Unfortunately, times have changed.**
      — Recommendation by the Production and Allocation Machine (PAL), adopted unanimously by the CEC under expedited procedures.

      And from the first chapter

      > Mandatory Session did indeed serve a good purpose, though. Instituted at the start of the current war, it was intended for the eventuality that the war got so serious that the government was obliged to **switch the economy from what they called "eudaimonic" back into a scarcity mode. If that ever happened, family Allocs would start being tied to productivity, essentially making productive activity nonvoluntary. And if things truly got bad, they might even have to go back to something capitalistic.**

      And

      > Being a magical girl… Many girls dreamed of it, despite all their parents' illegal discouragement. After all, you could have one wish for whatever you wanted, and the certainty of being lauded as a hero besides. In exchange for that, many, viewing the sterile desert of their current lives, would gladly pay the price.

      > **By the special conscription acts enacted nearly twenty years ago, all new [magical] girls owed the Human military thirty years of service, immediately, and the minimum age for combat involvement was dropped drastically, to thirteen.**

      > **You were treated as a hero by your community. The media wrote laudatory life stories and children adored you. Humanity felt guilty about its demands, and did everything it could to make it up to you**. It was only your family, and the families of other magical girls, who dared watch you with sad eyes.

      > Strictly speaking, this was all Ryouko was supposed to know. However, the Information Restriction Acts were impossible to enforce, and with the most cursory of internet searches, one could easily obtain myriad other, forbidden facts and figures.

      > For instance, no one was supposed to know about the soul extraction process, or about the terrible tie between one's emotional state and the corruption of one's gem. **No one was supposed to know how many died in their first combat assignment, or before their first leave**.

      > Ryouko swallowed. Despite everything, though, she envied them.

  I’m looking for books that try to deceive or otherwise mess with the reader. Descriptions of gore/etc for the purpose of traumatization aren’t wanted. I want a book that feels like my enemy, or that at least is throwing down some kind of gauntlet.

  I know this isn’t rational fiction, but I figured the type of people who like ratfic would be more likely to know what I’m looking for.

    I'm not sure if this is what you want or totally off-base, but I have two things in mind: first, [CORDYCEPS](https://archiveofourown.org/works/6178036?view_full_work=true), where the desire to find things out is also mirrored in the characters, and then *spoilers*. Second, [carl@fire](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/28356/carlfire) - it's so full of layers upon layers that to this day, I'm not 100% sure if it's satirizing the typical VRMMORPG isekai story, satirizing satire of the typical story, attacking the audience, attacking authors, attacking attacks on the audience, etc. etc. Probably not everyone's cup of tea, though. Also, neither are really _books_.

    Have you read House of Leaves? It's about a house that's bigger on the inside, but it's also about a documentary being made about the house, and a bunch of other things. Very mindfuck-y.

    Malazan series is known for its sort of opaque start in media res, and its insistence on totally changing most of the main characters every book. 

    Commonweal Saga by Graydon Saunders is also written somewhat difficultly. No gendered pronouns, and things are only mentioned once. Less deception and more just being difficult lmao. 

    Idk, Ulysses by Joyce?

    It’s a sequel but *Harrow the Ninth*

    Edit: To give this more context bc I have more time to write rn. The first book, *Gideon the Ninth*, doesn't fill the rec but is a very fun whodunit / competition between necromancers in space. It follows, effectively, a bodyguard.

    The sequel follows the guardee from the first book. Harrow is an incredible unreliable narrator and parts of it are written in second person. It also makes a subtle Homestar Runner reference.

    ```
    In which sense do you mean "deceive or otherwise mess with the reader"?

    1) An unreliable narrator

    2) or a book that challenges the reader in some way (whether through questioning beliefs, etc)
    ```

    - u/Azgerod:
      ```
      1.	Definitely.
      2.	Depends. If I can be made to REALLY question things I believe, without it just being “but do you really KNOW you aren’t a frog”, that would be cool yeah.

      Or any case where the author tries to make you think certain things through implication, while the actual events indicate the truth.

      Or a persuasive work that tries to make you believe something and then turns around and explains how they mindfucked you into believing it, maybe.

      Or repeatedly establishing expectations and then pulling the rug.

      But really it’s non-specific. I just want to feel like the author is fucking with me (successfully, preferably).

    Robert Reed's [Truth (archive link)](https://web.archive.org/web/20090414062819/http://www.asimovs.com/hugos_2009/Truth.shtml) is the epitome of "what do you know, and why do you think you know it", both for the plot and the reading experience.

    Tristam Shandy, written in the 1760s, sort of qualifies. 

    Infinite Jest, by David Foster Wallace.

    Somebody mentioned Joyce's Ulysses.

    One way that F/SF sometimes challenges readers is to throw them right into a new world without explaining anything, not even the worrld's uniquely created words and slang. An example might be like "A Clockwork Orange," my droogie. 

    Always Coming Home by Ursula LeGuin does this too.

    Sometimes F/SF starts with incomplete info, maybe because the protagonist has incomplete info, and reveals the world only as the character learns. Piranesi by Susanna Clarke is a wonderful example of this, highly recommended.

    Sometimes texts are just hard to read, though of course that's subjective. Gormenghast by Mervyn Peake.

    Have you read Foucault’s Pendulum? 
    The setup is similar to the DaVinci Code except: (1) it’s good (2) the protagonist may be going insane. 

    Although Umberto Eco is not an easy read. Expect Joyce/Pynchon levels of postmodern convolution.
    ```

  - u/ahasuerus_isfdb:
    ```
    Timothy Zahn's *The Icarus Hunt* (1999) is a pretty good space opera which cleverly messes with the reader.

    The Web serial [*Worm*](https://parahumans.wordpress.com/) is set in what at first appears to be a "dark superhero/supervillain" universe, but the reader repeatedly discovers that things are not what they appear to be. By the end of the novel every single assumption has been upended. I am not sure I would recommend it in this case (1.675 million words, extreme suffering, etc), but it certainly messes with the reader.

    Edit: spelling.
