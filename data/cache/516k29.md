  If Zorian has a mental breakdown, I would not be surprised. His mentor has basically just told him that he has to throw away his humanity to have a chance of getting out of this. I can imagine him waking up to Kirelle trying to comfort him due to crying in his sleep.
  ```

  - u/HotDropMarble:
    ```
    Yeah, this is a rough road ahead for Zorian, but when I read this segment I ended up sympathizing with Xvim a bit as well. Xvim just sold out his whole contact list to save the life of his student. Decades of friendships and acquaintances. An Archmage's rolodex. It can't be easy inviting someone to invade their minds. I can only assume Xvim is doing this only because he understands the magnitude of the task Zorian and Zach have in front of them.
    ```

    - u/Vakuza:
      ```
      Holy shit you're right, I never thought of it from that perspective. Makes me wonder if he sold out all of his contacts or a certain group that were immediately relevant, there has to be a few of dimensional mages in there. Zorian will also need help with soul magic too, are there any other types of mages Xvim would have given Zorian?
      ```

      - u/Overmind_Slab:
        ```
        Someone with soul magic may be able to resist him though. Most of the people on the list probably have rudimentary or no mental defenses. With a little bit of effort Zorian was able to break Xvim's mental shield and Xvim is a defense specialist.

        >Xvim just sold out doppelgangers of his whole contact list in a time loop with no consequences to help save the entire real world.

        Edited for accuracy.
        ```

        - u/gommm:
          ```
          There are consequences for the original people of that contact list not just for the doppelgängers. Zorian will learn techniques and secrets that those people would not want other people to learn but, in that case, the end justifies the mean.
          ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      Crap, I didn't consider that.  That's serious dedication from Xvim.

      And he has reputation for not taking his mentorships seriously.
      ```

      - u/thrawnca:
        ```
        Zorian has known for a long time that Xvim takes mentoring seriously. The mana-absorbing training cards, for instance. "Zorian's list of complaints about the man was several pages long, but it seemed that being cheap wasn't among them."
        ```

      - u/braiam:
        ```
        More like, they don't live enough to allow it to become serious enough.
        ```

    - u/Accord_:
      ```
      I agree that Xvim is a pretty good mentor after all but let's not forget it's also in his best interest to see atleast one of them get out alive. Well, in real Xvim's interest atleast. Red robe is out there in the real world with great power and knowledge about Cyoria's defenses which put real Xvim's life and much of what he's worked for in danger
      ```

  - u/Xtraordinaire:
    ```
    Yes, this took a rather grim turn. However the alternative for Zorian is death of in-loop and out-of-the-loop Zorians and thousands of other people. It is something to consider at least.
    ```

    - u/Vakuza:
      ```
      There has been a grim nose dive since they opened the memory packet, Zach even had a breakdown when he tried to attack the guardian and Zorian cut the restart short. As stupid as it sounds I think Zorian should really try and ask Raynie out to alleviate the stress, it could backfire but considering their previous meetings I doubt it.
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        Heh, I don't think joining the dating scene is exactly Zorian's idea of *relaxing*.  We've seen in this restart what he does for fun (or tries to at least): theoretical spell formulae, drawing and learning spells.
        ```

        - u/Vakuza:
          ```
          I might see a ship that I have only dreamed of sailing actually come to fruition!

          Jokes aside the main reason I suggested it is because drawing doesn't seemed to have helped him enough, if at all as it was mentioned in passing. Considering the situation he really needs something he actually enjoys and his meetings with Raynie are the only thing I remember him saying he enjoyed.

            Zach would react... in unpredictable ways. Better stick to drawing.

          - u/GodKiller999:
            ```
            It is the only ship I saw as viable, but it happening during the time loop would just ruin things and the author already said he wouldn't be doing anything romantic while the time loop was in effect.
            ```

      - u/Fredlage:
        ```
        The author has stated in several places that he thinks adding romance to the story would needlessly complicate it.
        ```

        - u/thrawnca:
          ```
          > he thinks adding romance to the story would needlessly complicate it.

          And that it would be difficult to do well.

          Maybe the story will end up with Zorian planning to get to know someone in particular better, but I don't expect that to be explored.
          ```

          Also it adds its own set of moral issues.

          - u/JackStargazer:
            ```
            Yes. There is a question of morality when you get infinite do-overs in a  relationship.
            ```

      - u/thrawnca:
        ```
        Honestly, I think that for a date to be properly non-stressful, it would have to be with someone who knows what's going on. And I don't think that a date with Taiven would be relaxing for him. Dating Raynie would mean covering up lots of things, which wouldn't reduce stress.
        ```

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    Could it be a test of Zorian's ethics? After all, misuse of mind magic is the major alternative explanation for his abilities.
    ```

    - u/GodKiller999:
      ```
      Doubtful, Zorian could just do things after this specific month and Xvim wouldn't know about it.
      ```

      - u/thrawnca:
        ```
        > Zorian could just do things after the this specific month and Xvim wouldn't know about it.

        True enough.

        It could also be a test of whether Zorian is telling the truth about the loop. His willingness to do it, at what would otherwise be great risks - and his possession of their knowledge in future restarts - would be strong evidence.

        Of course, it will also get more uncomfortable in future restarts when Zorian tells him, "I've been breaking into the minds of mages to steal their secrets, and oh, I just happen to know all about your contacts and the secret information you've collected about lots of important people - but I haven't been breaking into *your* mind, honest!"
        ```

        - u/GodKiller999:
          ```
          Xvim actions would indicate that he probably believes Zorian when it comes to the time loop, so while more information is useful, it starts getting a bit redundant on top of everything else.

          I think that if he was willing to tell him that he'd at least add that it was Xvim himself who gave him the list and told him to do this to them.
          ```

          - u/thrawnca:
            ```
            > Xvim actions would indicate that he probably believes Zorian

            On his own, yeah, but he's been hanging out with Alanic, who's more skeptical...and Xvim didn't previously know that Zorian was a powerful mind mage. Although I agree that he does seem convinced.

            > he'd at least add that it was Xvim himself who gave him the list

            Of course, but do you trust someone who has already admitted to rummaging through the minds of a bunch of other people?

            > Thought 1: But I saw the troll kill Hermione.

            > Thought 2: Professor Quirrell Memory-Charmed me and set up the scene that Dumbledore saw when he arrived.

            > Thought 3: Professor Quirrell can't do that, his magic can't touch mine. I saw that in Azkaban -

            > Thought 4: Can I trust those memories?

            > Thought 5: There was clearly some sort of debacle at Azkaban, we wouldn't have needed a rocket if Professor Quirrell hadn't fallen unconscious, and why'd he be unconscious if not -

            > Thought 7: I clearly practiced controlling Dementors at some point before I scared that Dementor in the Wizengamot. And *that* was in the newspapers.

            - u/GodKiller999:
              ```
              Ok better put it this way then, what's the point of telling him something that'd make him look distrustful out of the blue? The only reason he even told them he was a mind mage this time around was because he was laying down all his cards. Otherwise not talking about it is always the right decision.

    The author's mentioned in his FAQ that a few plot threads might get dropped.  I wonder if Silverlake is one of them.  The Grey Hunter will probably end up being used for something, but we might never see what Silverlake had in mind.

    Also, I think the Grey Hunter's general magic resistance would apply to Zorian's mind magic as well.
    ```

    - u/-Fender-:
      ```
      Another plot thread related to Silverlake, is that she asked Zorian to tell Kael that he should bring his daughter to her; that she would pass on the centuries of Witch knowledge she knows to her, essentially taking her on as an apprentice.

      This seems extremely interesting, and might allow us to finally learn more about why Kana is the way she is. Honestly, I sometimes wonder if Fria actually transferred parts of her own memories, or of Namira's memories, to Kana, which could partly explain her behaviour. Of course, simply having the memories of someone older wouldn't mean that she wouldn't act as a child regardless, but it could explain her intelligence.

      So, who knows? Hopefully, Silverlake comes back at some point in the future. Meeting Zorian's grandmother could also be interesting.
      ```

      - u/Kodix:
        ```
        I forgot to ever write it out, but at some point I considered the notion that Kana is actually Kael's attempt at resurrecting his wife, and that Silverlake may or may not suspect that this is so (based on her words).

        Can't recall what my evidence for and against was, but it's food for thought.
        ```

    - u/Fredlage:

      > The author's mentioned in his FAQ that a few plot threads might get dropped.

      - u/None:

        [Here](https://www.fictionpress.com/u/804592/nobody103)


        In particular (emphasis mine):

        > Q: Love the story but it is getting to be quite long. Do you have an ending planned?

        > Everything is planned, from the beginning to the end to everything in between. Though **some of the stuff in between is optional** or subject to change, provided it's not plot critical.

        So yeah, I guess my interpretation is a bit pessimistic, but I could see Silverlake herself not playing much of a role in the future.
        ```

        - u/thrawnca:
          ```
          I would more optimistically assume that there are minor details that will never appear in the story at all, as opposed to Chekhov's Gun being mothballed.

          Plus, the grey hunter was brought up again when Kael advised Zorian to turn it into a potion instead of a familiar. And again, when Zorian wondered whether Zach would be able to defeat it without harming the eggs. And now Zorian is again wanting to transform into magical creatures. And Silverlake was mentioned in chapter 56, when Zorian decided that she hadn't taught him anything. No way is all that just getting shelved.
          ```

          - u/thrawnca:
            ```
            Note that for Zorian's current training plan, they don't even have to save the eggs. Though if it's feasible, I'm sure that Lukav, too, would find them fascinating to study.
            ```

            - u/Gauntlet:
              ```
              Zorian seems to be the type that would like to kill two birds with one stone. If he can get both the Grey Hunter's sensitivity and Silverlake's tuition he will. Also she seems to have some sort of dimensional ability, might be useful during the endgame.
              ```

              - u/thrawnca:
                ```
                > she seems to have some sort of dimensional ability

                Excellent point. If her house really is in a pocket dimension, then a) she knows far more about the subject than Xvim, and b) she could surely offer insights about stopping the primordial release.
                ```

          - u/Kodix:
            ```
            I would actually kinda like it if some Checkhov's Guns remained unfired. It adds some uncertainty, making the story less predictable, and it's pretty dang realistic.
            ```

        - u/Xtraordinaire:
          ```
          I really really doubt Silverlake got more than a chapter just for exposition purposes.
          ```

          - u/Iconochasm:
            ```
            The Gray Hunter could be important, and I appreciate when stories show a path just fail.  Sometimes things just don't work out, not every gun on a mantle actually gets fired.
            ```

        - u/Fredlage:
          ```
          Oh.. that's always been there... I thought he'd said something more specific... I do think you're being pessimistic, as I always took that to mean his plans for stuff in between might change, not that he might give up on a plot thread he had already started.
          ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Also possibly the dragon thread. Zach took time to kill Oganj, and we never really learned why. We still don't know (though we can make a pretty decent guess that Oganj has one of the pieces of the key), but presumably Zach still knows how to do it. They could make a dragon transformation potion.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      [deleted]
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        It was never explained why he attacked the dragon. Zorian assumed at the time, at least in part because he wasn't too fond of Zach, that he just did it for shits and giggles, but we've discovered more recently that Zach isn't quite as random as that.

        My basic theory is that, at one point, Red Robe was working together with Zach (under false pretenses) to collect the key. Zach might have assumed it was so they could more sufficiently control the time loop, but Red Robe's real plan was to obtain the powers over the time loop for himself. After obtaining the five pieces of the key (one from Oganj, who Zach is probably the only person who could take him down by himself), Red Robe quickly took Zach down using mind magic and wiped his memory of everything that had happened.
        ```

        - u/thrawnca:
          ```
          I'm skeptical about your basic theory, because Zach defeated Oganj *after* Zorian entered the loop. At which point, Zach was already endlessly fighting the invaders, with no sign of any other plan and RR nowhere in sight. And quite possibly with holes in his memory already, although it's hard to be sure exactly how much of that was lingering damage from the lich.
          ```

        - u/throwawayIWGWPC:
          ```
          This is a great theory.
          ```

        - u/bludvein:
          ```
          My personal theory for why Zach kept trying to kill Oganj is because he was trying to learn dragon magic. There's also relatively few opponents that can actually beat him, so part of the motivation could've simply been practice.
          ```

- u/notmy2ndopinion:
  ```
  Wow, I love this chapter. We really get a sense of Xvim's ruthlessly practical approach, as well as a new quest line opening up for grey hunter spider potion-making.

  Re: Xvim:

  Does this mean that Xvim has given his explicit consent to be completely mind magicked (it can't be mind rape if he says "yes")

  If Zorian doesn't ask Xvim to be the first good/neutral arch-Mage he mentally interrogates, then I will be disappointed, since Xvim is the only person Zorian can really feel comfortable breaking to such a degree since he offered it as the strategy leading up to the final plan.

  Re: Grey Hunter potions

  Here's my guess of how what is to come... Zach will be the tempting bait and Zorian will just sneak into the spiders lair and steal some eggs. Then they use the potions and troll Xvim's most unsavory Rolodex contacts for power-leveling.
  ```

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    > Zorian will just sneak into the spiders lair and steal some eggs

    Perhaps you have forgotten that the eggs are attached to the spider's underbelly.

    > He withdrew everything he said about Silverlake's task being easier than killing the thing – this was actually way harder, since he was only getting the eggs by taking them from the grey hunter's cooling corpse but had to be careful when killing her not to damage the (likely much frailer) egg sack.
    >
    > The second thing he noticed was that the spider was steadily getting closer to his location.
    ```

    - u/notmy2ndopinion:
      ```
      Indeed, I totally forgot about that detail. Zorian could get creative and use a magic booby trap jug of alchemical universal solvent that triggers in an anti-magic field to let the webbing melt, while Zach uses all the direct combat magic tricks he has to distract.

      I still think the author will make it look like they are going to do a direct assault to neutralize the grey hunter with seeming desperate failure... but Zorian just waltzes over and snags the eggs before they both teleport away.

          Another option: wreck the spider, turn it into potions, get to know it from the inside, find a thermal exhaust port. Then retrieve the eggs next time.

  ```
  >"An excellent choice for someone in your situation," Xvim nodded approvingly. "Endlessly useful and it would be quite dangerous to train outside the time loop."

  >Alanic gave Xvim a mildly scandalized look.

  It's midly amusing that Alanic reacts this way when he had no issue with abusing Zorian mind magic to mind rape Sudomir.
  ```

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    The first time Zorian ever met Alanic, he learned that Alanic is a *battle* priest, who believes in pursuing and dispatching fleeing enemies with lethal force. Obviously, Sudomir was firmly in the category of people he felt had forfeited their rights.

    Perhaps he's just less familiar, and thus less comfortable, with mental violence. Plus training it is not necessarily self-defence. He's still a priest, presumably trying to make the world a better place, and having a trainee run around wrecking people's minds for training is not the sort of thing he would encourage.
    ```

    - u/DrRuffus:
      ```
      Especially since at this point Alanic still doesn't believe the time loop is real it takes him a few more days this loop to believe enough to tell him how to convince himself next loop.
      ```

- u/thrawnca:
  ```
  Previously I've discounted the idea that the time loop could have been initiated specifically to stop the primordial, since the primordial won't be released in the real world for another month. How would anyone know, at that early point, that it would be needed?

  But if the Maker is a god of some sort, then it might well know what was coming, and activate the Gate ASAP to counteract it.
  ```

  - u/RMcD94:
    ```
    Maybe the timeloop is always running a simulation of the world waiting to detect universe ending events, or what have you?
    ```

    - u/thrawnca:
      ```
      Only if the Guardian is lying about the loop running out of power and shutting down.
      ```

      - u/GodKiller999:
        ```
        Depends what the costs are, if copying the world is very expensive maybe not, but if most of the powers is spent on iterations, then doing an iteration a month early just to test the waters and see if wasting energy to avoid a massive catastrophe, would be worth it.
        ```

        - u/throwawayIWGWPC:
          ```
          Exactly. If iterations are what is cost prohibitive, you make ONE perpetual, non-looping simulation and let it run at a slightly faster rate just to mom monitor everything. You only need to remake the simulation whenever terrible event occurs and you need to intervene, so it’s two to three orders of magnitude cheaper than the sovereign gate running a ONCE.

          This way, you always know when you need to come around and fix stuff and it’s relatively cheap.
          ```

          - u/NotteBoy:
            ```
            But the simulation isn't perfect due to it not having access to the divine realm which would cause ripple effects.
            ```

            - u/monkyyy0:
              ```
              Maybe the simulation running a month early is the divine realm?
              ```

            - u/throwawayIWGWPC:
              ```
              I forgot about that. But the simulation doesn’t necessarily have to be cut off from the divine realm. I think for the sovereign gate, it makes sense to get rid of any anomalies that having access to the divine realm would create.
              ```

          - u/thrawnca:
            ```
            > you make ONE perpetual, non-looping simulation

            And then someone finds the exit and invades the real world.
            ```

            - u/throwawayIWGWPC:
              ```
              Very low probability. Remember that no one even knows the simulation is a simulation.

              But if they breach the loop into the real world, they’ll think they actually travelled far into the past. It’s hardly cause for concern except in certain circumstances that could be addressed on a case-by-case basis.
              ```

            - u/kaukamieli:
              ```
              That loop doesn't need to have keys or exits. Needs to just see if shit hits the fan.
              ```

              - u/thrawnca:
                ```
                I don't think it's possible to have a pocket dimension with no exit. It sounds like they always touch another dimension in at least one place.
                ```

      - u/WarningInsanityBelow:

        But that might only be true since it doing thousands of iterations in a fraction of a second, maybe running a world simulation once a day to check anything bad happens in the next month is completely sustainable. (I imagine the gate has some way to recharge, that might not help much during a simulate-the-world-thousands-of-times-for-the-chosen-one-in-a-single-second mode, but it might recharge more than a single simulations worth in day)

    The way I see it is that the time loop is actually a backup solution for the world.

    It only saves the last couple of months and when the Maker or w/e system deems it necessary to activate it, the time loop is run over that month time period that was saved up. However, going through that accelerated looping drains power while just saving the previous month doesn't take too much.

    They have to travel to another continent and search for lost artifacts - and Zorian is planning to collect cash, hire researchers, and raid whatever libraries he can find. Sounds sensible.

    Training mind magic just makes sense. There's a huge fight coming, and that's how he can excel. His classic combat magic is well-honed, but always pretty limited. His mind magic, on the other hand, brought down Sudomir's bone dragon. And Sudomir.
    ```

    - u/notintractable:
      ```
      But if they can't get out, it's all for nothing.  I imagine that it would take at least 1 restart per treasure for a total of 8 (iirc) for 8 treasures.  Then probably a few restarts to optimize their collection strategy so that they can collect all 8 and return to the Gate all in one restart.  That, by itself, is already at least 10 of the around 40 restarts left.  Unless these researchers and libraries can somehow help ZZ do this, I don't like their decision making.  Training for the big fight can always happen after you've ensured the big fight will happen.  At least that's my view.

        Five treasures, actually. Theoretically they are scattered across the continent of Miasina - although since the Gate has been activated, there is a possibility that the Key was actually assembled and used to mark the original Controller.

        And if you estimate that it would take 10 restarts to actually do the collection, then that leaves 30 restarts in which it's a good idea to raise skills and gather information.

  I'm in favor of Zorian not going nuts because there's really no proof that he won't be just as bad as Red Robe if he does go down this road, especially it if it really is that easy to go around just mind stealing at the drop of a hat once he gets out.

  - u/thrawnca:

    > empathy is trained enough

    Er...isn't this backward? The more highly trained he is, the *more* likely he is to know exactly what he's putting people through. And yes, he has trained the ability to shut out the emotions of a crowd, but I hardly think that applies while reaching into someone's mind and digging through it.

    > what kind of defenses people who rank on Xvim's mental rolodex would offer

    Well, Xvim is an archmage who specialises in defence, with a virtually flawless mental shield, but being non-psychic, he still couldn't stand up to Zorian's assault. So unless some of these people are highly-trained psychics, their defences can only slow Zorian down and force him to attack from ambush.

    A more likely scenario is that he'll be able to covertly bypass their defences, if any, in under 60 seconds.

    > there's really no proof that he won't be just as bad as Red Robe

    Yeah, level-grinding on people is definitely unethical. Won't necessarily stop him, given a strong enough need. Aranea are people, after all. Many of them very decent people. He hated going after them, and he wouldn't have outside the loop - but inside the loop, with a big enough need, he did it.

      When I say trained I mean he did essentially the same thing with the cult people during the invasion when he was trying to save the catshifter.  Like clearly it's possible to smash and grab memories and leave them catatonic, he's done it both then and later on with the master of the mansion during his interrogation.  So that's more my thinking, except he makes the comment about the spiders so ehh...

      With the rolodex, I can't help but think Xvim has sent him other mages who are ALSO mind mages or that he suspects to have some research into that area.  I mean if I were xvim they'd be the first names to go on that list.  Get zorian the knowledge about his strongest play.

        That and Xvim is good but there have to be people who are better, hell I'd be willing to bet there are a few contacts in there with contacts with the spiders.  I doubt anyone's gone as far as zorian has with them but it's a big world and I wouldn't put it past mages or spiders to figure some kind of trade out.  Granted I suspect in 80%+ of the time that 60 seconds estimate will be likely.

      Again I'm not saying Zorian won't buckle down and do it.  I'm just saying once you agree that there is a need.  What if coming out of the loop the need persists?  Will he do it outside the loop if the need is high enough?  The mindset he develops in the loop won't just disappear once he gets out, and after that who knows what kind of justifications for "the greater good" will arise in his life even post RR?
      ```

      - u/thrawnca:
        ```
        > he did essentially the same thing with the cult people during the invasion

        Sure, he's capable of it. The difference is, he's already stated that he doesn't have sympathy for the invaders. They're an actual and serious threat, traitors to their country (and their planet), about to massacre a bunch of civilians, etc. He did an even more thorough job (though less destructive due to his increased skill) on Sudomir, and was quite happy with himself. What bothers him is attacking people who have done nothing at all.

        > I can't help but think Xvim has sent him other mages who are ALSO mind mages

        They're quite unlikely to be at Zorian's level.

        >  I'd be willing to bet there are a few contacts in there with contacts with the spiders

        What are you wagering?

        I doubt that there are any natural mind mages on the list who have trained with the aranea - and any aranean contact less than that is simply a useful tidbit of information for Zorian to scoop up.

        > What if coming out of the loop the need persists?

        The risks are massively increased. Currently, his reset switch makes him immune to prosecution, greatly protected from retaliation, etc. Plus, and perhaps most importantly, his victims will be unaffected and healthy in the next restart. Wrecking someone's life for real is a whole other level of callous. He'd need orders of magnitude more justification to drive him to this afterward.
        ```

        - u/ryujinmaru:
          ```
          I'm just saying he also says the same about the spiders and how bad that feels.  Yet we seem to get no hesitation even with the justification of him not caring.  It makes me uncertain about the level of feedback that he does get whenever he rips through an entities mind.  Or is the distinction because the spiders are psychic and thus feel attacks like that on a deeper level which he picks up?

          I agree that most people won't be at Zorian's level but I doubt all of them are pushovers.

          My wager is because the aranea have traded or kidnapped mages in the past.  I doubt they've ever tried to interact with the taboo of mind magic and closing off of the web but there are always weirdos like the witch.

          If anything I'd argue the reverse could also be applied here.  Yes, he can act as he pleases because he knows the reset will fix things, and can't once he leaves.  In another sense, the only attempt that matters is the one outside.  The invasion, the primordial summoning, the mansion, everything that could go wrong matters a magnitude more because there will be actual consequences.  If anything the justification FOR being ruthless to prevent the lich king or RR from succeeding is greater than anything in the loops.  Last time pays for all.

    Zorian is in no way an average Mage. at ALL. he upset Taiven because he can beat her. he can make very good golems and very good with engraving, wards, teleportation, invisibility, you name it. 

    it's not that Zorian is an average mage but is far from sufficient compared to the task at hand if even Xzim is not confident, enough to the extent that he isn't even sure if he could get himself to tackle such a task if he were in Zorian's shoes
    ```

    - u/ggrey7:
      ```
      Taiven is a graduate fresh out of the academy specializing in one general area. Beating her doesn't mean anything. Anything he does, there are plenty of people who can do it better. Maybe average isn't the right word here, but he's just a student with a few years of concentrated education. Mind magic is the only area where Zorian would be considered a master.

      Xvim is basically telling him that solving the timeloop with such a deadline requires a specific type of skillset (read: "acquiring" knowledge and info rapidly) that he couldn't do as a defense specialist.
      ```

      - u/thrawnca:
        ```
        > specializing in one general area

        But that area was combat magic, and he can often beat her in combat. That's the definition of an archmage, is it not; someone who is skilled enough in multiple fields to beat specialists in those fields? Not that Zorian is at the level of beating adult specialist combat mages, but he's certainly on the archmage career track.
        ```

        - u/ggrey7:
          ```
          He certainly is on the right track, but the point is he's not there yet (and he might never get there if he can't get out of the loop intact). 

          So right now, he's just one of those jack of all trades, master of none, i.e. average-ish compared to a true specialist in all those fields.

          - u/thrawnca:

            Compared to an *adult* specialist, yes.

            Compared to third-year academy students, as GoXDS stated, he's way above average in a wide variety of fields.

  This is a bit off topic, but can we talk about fictionpress/fanfiction.net for a moment? Has anyone noticed that the mobile version of the site (replace www. with m. in the url) is basically objectively better in every way, even on nonmobile devices?

  Not only does it lack the ineffectual copyguard that prevents you from highlighting anything, but it also behaves more nicely as you zoom in and out, scaling the line length to fit your screen (whereas nonmobile seems to assume that I enjoy scrolling left to right as I read each line).

  In fact... I wish they'd just make the mobile version the only version...
  ```

  - u/gbear605:

    I strongly disagree for myself. The mobile version doesn't have margins (only relevant on large screens), uses Arial instead of Verdana (though that's personal preference), shows a lot more information in the top bar, the line length scaling is only an issue if you have a tiny screen (less than 768px wide), behaves nicely with zoom as long as it's bigger than the equivalent of 768px - so 300% zoom on my computer, and while the copyguard is annoying, it's a [simple chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/selectable-for-fanfiction/jcidlhgdoojamkbpmhbpgldmajnobefd?utm_source=chrome-app-launcher-info-dialog) to fix.

    I'm sorry that you have evidently have a smaller screen than I do, but for many people, the desktop version is superior.
    ```

    - u/gabbalis:
      ```
      So what you're saying is that the pixel width of your screen divided by the zoom multiplier has to be greater than 768?

      That does seem about right. My screen is 1366px wide and I have issues at 200% zoom and above, but not at 175% which is the next highest zoom that I can get without fiddling with browser code. By your claim 178% should be the fail point for my screen. So yeah that fits.

      I'm curious whether a larger screen would help me though. I'm already happy with how much of my FoV my current screen takes up. If I double the screen height and width, And double my zoom, but move the monitor farther away so that the relative FoV remains constant, won't the relative text size remain constant too?

      Obviously what you have works for you, but I suspect you might just like smaller text than me in the first place.

  - u/cretan_bull:
    ```
    I strongly disagree.

    I do most of my browsing on a desktop. When on mobile, I use Firefox on Android, and have yet to come across a *single* website where the mobile version is preferable to the desktop.

    While the fictionpress/fanfiction mobile site is nowhere near as bad as most, I nonetheless, find it almost unusable because the text is so large as to make it extremely uncomfortable to read. As far as I can tell, it entirely disregards browser text size preferences. I do not know enough about modern HTML and CSS to say whether this is the fault of the browser or the site. On desktop, shortcuts to change the text size (i.e. Ctrl-scroll) work fine on the mobile site, so I'm not sure why this is.

    So on mobile I use Firefox's "reader view" which essentially just extracts the text and displays it without formatting. It also provides the means to adjust the text size to something far more comfortable, and works equally well on the mobile or desktop versions.

    Before I discovered "reader view" I used the desktop site on my phone. I had to zoom in so that the margins fell off-screen, but at that point it was comfortably readable and far superior to the mobile site.

    On desktop the mobile site works fine if the browser is narrowed to a reasonable width, but is otherwise essentially unreadable. It *does* scale better to narrower widths, but having such a size-constrained screen on a desktop is virtually unheard-of.

    Thankfully you can't. It doesn't matter if they will die anyway afterwards, since it's not about them but himself. Ignore those moral alarm bells too often and he'd end up a very different person than he wanted to be when the loop ends. It's a slippery slope and you're suggesting hurling himself off at full speed.

      Good point.  I guess we should all seize upon any opportunities we have to steal people's secrets at the cost of leaving them insane or dead, then.

        To be fair, that doesn't happen unless the mind mage is clumsy and/or inexperienced. Done properly memory reading inflicts no harm at all. It's problems are all ethical in nature since it's the worst invasion of privacy possible.

          Yes, so the more Zorian does it, the less harm he’ll inflict.

      It's not really about them dying, it's about them being resurrected in prim condition less than a month later.

  Question: I read MoL back when it was much shorter. I can't remember the exact chapter number but our plucky MC had only recently started venturing out of the academy for his loops.

  To all of you that are fully caught up: how close do you think we are to the story's conclusion? I plan to pick it back up and read it straight from beginning to end.

    Based on the previous arc length, we're probably looking at 25-30 chapters remaining. 1 chapter every 3-4 weeks (since they're sometimes delayed), you're looking at two years, give or take half a year.

    * Arc 1: [01](https://m.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/01) - [26](https://m.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/26) ( 26 Chapters )

      Is arc 3 the final arc?

        Yes

        > Q: Curious, how far would you say the story is?

        > A: The story basically has 3 arcs, and I finished two as of chapter 54. So I'm about 2/3 of the way done.

      Actually that's 28 chapters for Arc 2 (54 - 26).

    I think we reached the end of Part 1 of ?3? a few chapters ago, but the story is moving at a pretty quick pace lately (please correct me if I'm wrong)
    ```

    - u/bludvein:
      ```
      Part 2 is the one that ended.

  If Xvim is this ruthless about this shit, I wonder how long it'll be before he gives his consent to do the six restart thing.
