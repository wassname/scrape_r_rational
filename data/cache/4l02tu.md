## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  What plausible futures are the outcome that follow *War of the Worlds* (the original)? If aliens come down to Earth in 1897 with immensely superior technology and are subsequently defeated by the common cold, what do you think 2016 looks like?

  Edit: If you've never read it, you can read it online [here](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/36/36-h/36-h.htm). Also, I have dibs on the title *War of the Many-Worlds*.

    It's been a very long time since I read War of the Worlds. I don't recall anything in particular that explicitly laid out why the Martians wouldn't try again in a couple of years (the ideal time to launch from Mars to Earth occurs roughly every couple years IIRC). Even if there was a good reason that the Martians would only attack once ever and never try again but this time with better antiviral defenses, I don't remember a way for the humans to know that... so expect a combination of huge defense spending / military buildup that would make the Cold War look like peanuts combined with some sort of setup to try to eventually counterinvade or bomb Mars.
    ```

      I get the feeling the Martians did not intend to immediately invade. They crash-landed (hence the need for repairs) and come out of their spacecraft without wearing suits. They find something wrong with the air and retreat, perhaps assuming some sort of gas attack. At that point they finally attack, from what they might perceive as self defense.

      Martians watching everything from afar, especially with the disease that ultimately crippled their forces, would have to think long and hard about a genuine invasion. They might put more effort into communicating this time around.

        That sounds like it might lead to a sort of Earth-Mars Cold War, which certainly sounds interesting and entirely appropriate.
        ```

          ```
          A cold war scenario is interesting, but would require the forces to be roughly evenly matched. Mars definitely has the advantage in technological terms, but what does Earth have? 

          If we accept teh narrators claim that the Martians are the last of a dying civilisation, then Earth may vastly outnumber them in population terms and therefore economic capacity. Depending what remains of their industry they may have a finite suply of technological items they can't mass manufacture, meaning thy would have to be extremely cautious. And likewise with the lives of their species. 

          Whereas Earth governments could mass manufacture weapons and throw the lives of their citizens into the meat blender,

        >  get the feeling the Martians did not intend to immediately invade

        Its possible that, if the martian economic and technological advances are to a realistic degree beyond those of earth, that what earth treated as a full scale invasion represented only a microscopic effort on their part. 

        For an analogy, imagine if a group of individuals from the modern day, equipped with off the shelf guns and explosives, invaded somewhere equivalent to a bronze age civilisation. They could run around and cause immense havoc. For the locals it would feel like godlike powers were being unleashed in a deliberte intent to destroy them, for the originator civilisation it would be more like  group of redneck hunters going off and getting drunk, shooting up the local wildlife, then dying because they forgot to disinfect their water. 

        The invasion force may just be a tiny subsection of martian civilisation
        ```

    - u/alexanderwales:
      ```
      Yup, that's even in the epilogue.

      > A question of graver and universal interest is the possibility of another attack from the Martians. I do not think that nearly enough attention is being given to this aspect of the matter. At present the planet Mars is in conjunction, but with every return to opposition I, for one, anticipate a renewal of their adventure. In any case, we should be prepared. It seems to me that it should be possible to define the position of the gun from which the shots are discharged, to keep a sustained watch upon this part of the planet, and to anticipate the arrival of the next attack.

      > [...]

      > At any rate, whether we expect another invasion or not, our views of the human future must be greatly modified by these events. We have learned now that we cannot regard this planet as being fenced in and a secure abiding place for Man; we can never anticipate the unseen good or evil that may come upon us suddenly out of space. It may be that in the larger design of the universe this invasion from Mars is not without its ultimate benefit for men; it has robbed us of that serene confidence in the future which is the most fruitful source of decadence, the gifts to human science it has brought are enormous, and it has done much to promote the conception of the commonweal of mankind. It may be that across the immensity of space the Martians have watched the fate of these pioneers of theirs and learned their lesson, and that on the planet Venus they have found a securer settlement. Be that as it may, for many years yet there will certainly be no relaxation of the eager scrutiny of the Martian disk, and those fiery darts of the sky, the shooting stars, will bring with them as they fall an unavoidable apprehension to all the sons of men.

    As I've mentioned [before](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3vutn4/hsf_charles_stross_sciencefictional_shibboleths/cxrpgww), alien microbial life (which the spacecraft, the tripods, as well as the bodies of dead aliens will contain in surprisingly large amounts) will interact unpredictably with our own.

    The same risk that killed the aliens could very well kill us in ways our immune system might be ill-prepared to fight, and medical epidemiology in 1895 is only just starting to stretch its legs.

    The "red weed" may be related, and turn out to be disastrous.

    Is their tech left behind when they die? Is it usable by humans, or at least salvageable? If so, I imagine that the reverse engineered tech will have at least as much long term cultural impact as the war itself, if not more.
    ```

    - u/Dwood15:
      ```
      IIRC, There were like 10/12 of those things marching around in Europe in the book- and I'd guarantee our ability to eventually reverse engineer the tech, but i don't think it would come until the 1920's-30s.
      ```

    - u/alexanderwales:
      ```
      The book doesn't go into too much detail on these matters, and I think you'd have to retcon a lot of it because it *was* written in 1897. However, if we know that they were at the very least capable of launching from Mars and landing on Earth, we can assume that their minimum tech level almost certainly includes computers of some kind. Given their capabilities, there's also an upper bound on what they can do, as a lot of their actions would be rendered trivial by something like e.g. nanobots.

      I think 1897 scientists *might* be able to figure out something like [the Apollo Guidance Computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_Guidance_Computer), but I'm really doubtful of their ability to reverse-engineer something like a modern day desktop computer, especially since so many components are made with really complicated processes that can't be easily discovered without having the base research. In addition to that, it would all be in a wildly different language and probably produced by a mindset that's far away from human.

      So for the sake of argument, let's say that there's some technological gain, and some proof of concept, but that technology is only going to be a decade or two ahead (and in some uneven ways).
      ```

      - u/space_fountain:
        ```
        The idea of specialized computers like the Apollo Guidance computer makes me wonder if you could salvage components, like maybe reactors or even control systems from technology left behind and use it even if you don't understand how it works. If you have something like a [RTG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioisotope_thermoelectric_generator) in 1897 I'm not sure that they would be able to understand and I certainly don't think it would give them much of a leg up on building their own, but I bet they could use it for their own applications.
        ```

      - u/hoja_nasredin:
        ```
        I suspect that the idea that "this can be done/this problem have a solution" will double the speed at which it will be discovered. More people will try to re-invent the tech.
        ```

      - u/Aabcehmu112358:
        ```
        Technically, it's possible that the Martians themselves may just be computationally capable enough on a biological level to serve as their own guidance. I remember reading somewhere (I think it was some kind of sequel or something) that the Martians were in fact some sort of bio-engineered meat-computer species developed by a more ancient (and also originally earthly, hence why they are even vulnerable to extant strains at all) race. Flexible canon, though, and it may be worthwhile to ignore that idea.

        Aside from computers (and math, since even if it's in a different language, the rocket equation is the rocket equation, and so on), other aspects of rocketry will probably be boosted a bit, possibly enough to push them into the early stages of weaponization. Are heat-rays and black smoke replicable by humans? Also, are heat-rays actually high-powered lasers or something similar, or are they something more exotic?

        Metallurgy from the tripods will be hard to replicate, but the machinery itself maybe easier, and may add marginally towards things like cars or tanks.

        Given how fast it reproduces, red creepers may be able to survive and adapt to the earthly ecosystem despite their lack of immunity, especially in cold climates and at high altitudes. Cracking down on it when it manages to get out of those areas and starts choking out crops may be an issue.

        I suppose, looking beyond technology, the entire world is basically going be shoved in a war state of mind. Even if the Martians in the book were the last refugees of a water-less planet (which personally seems unlikely to me), there is no way for anyone on Earth to know that, which means that any country with the economy and resources starts preparing for a second wave.

          Actually, in the book the ships are launched via some sophisticated cannon rather than any sort of rocketry, since this was believed to be the way that space travel would happen. I'm not sure how a cannon like that could be made to work though, not if it's going interplanetary and expected to carry biological organisms. It would be easy to retcon that the narrator is wrong about that though.

  Ideas of not obvious Undeads?
  Once you use the classic ones, vampire, werewolves (not really an undead but wahtever), zombie, lich, ghost (banchee, specters etc.), skeletons, frankestein monsters. 

  What is left that is not a bigger zombie mixed with animal parts?
  ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    Go look at what gaps are left.

    Vampires drink blood, werewolves eat flesh. What sort of creature consumes bones? What sort slurps up the nervous system like spaghetti? Is there an undead of entrails?

    Zombies are whole corpse reanimation, while skeletons are just the core. You can invert that though, to create a lovingly deboned undead which flops around as just a creature of muscle.

    Alternately, you might want to look at emotional resonance. If vampires are lust and werewolves are rage, then what would an undead of greed look like? What about an undead of depression, envy, sloth, etc.?
    ```

    - u/hoja_nasredin:

      Nice. Se we take two of those and combine them.
      Consumes bones and grief, It destroys the backbone of people that fight him, in both literal and allegorical senses.

      How does it look?
      ```

      - u/alexanderwales:
        ```
        That seems fine. You'd still want to fill in some more information, like how it reproduces or is created, but a bone-eating grief creature is good. I think the unspoken analogy to stress-eating is a pretty good one; a vampire consumes because it has a lust for blood, but the bone-eating grief creature consumes because it's trying to fill a void within itself. (Or something.)
        ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        Alternatively, does not consume bones but collects them, greed monster that bigs up cemeteries and collects bones and uses them to build its underground nest or warren, and draws strength from them. Certain bones are more valuable than others of course, famous people perhaps, or older bones provided they are well preserved. Would fight to get particular rare specimens with is own kind or humans, might break into a museum to steal paleolithic skeletons, or mummies,

    Back when Dwarf Fortress first implemented the undead, one of the first unintended side effects the devs noticed was that when you butcher a body and reanimate it, you not only get a spooky skeleton but also a hollow shell of skin walking around. This has been my favorite undead since then.
    ```

    - u/hoja_nasredin:
      ```
      Cool. Did anyone tried to make stories or fluff about those creatures?
      ```

    - u/Galap:
      ```
      the skin can actually be really hard to kill as well. I remember getting into a really protracted fight with a dead necromancer's reanimated head skin.
      ```

  - u/Chronophilia:
    ```
    Can you animate someone's skeleton while they're still alive?
    ```

    - u/ulyssessword:
      ```
      Yes.  A highly skilled Osteomancer (not all Necromancers are Osteomancers, and not all Osteomancers are Necromancers) can animate a living body's skeleton and allow both the host and the skeleton's possessing spirit to live in the same body indefinitely.

      (A moderately-skilled Osteomancer can animate a living skeleton and have both host and spirit live in the same body until the host dies from anemia due to not having any bone marrow.)

      Aside from the expected difficulties in complex ritual magic, Skelemen pose several unique challenges:

       - Two minds, one body: The host and spirit can have conflicting goals and desires.  This can be intentional (in the case of high-value prisoners, corrupt officials, and other rebellious people) or else inadvertent (in the case of misunderstood instructions, conflicting priorities, and insufficient information).  Most hosts can overpower their skeletons for short periods of time with moderate effort, but it difficult, awkward, and tiring.
       - Senses:  Skeletons inside a body lose access to many of their senses.  Their life-sense is overwhelmed by their host body and therefore useless.  Their tremorsense is similarly dampened, as the host body does not transmit vibrations as well as stone or bone.  They are also blind, having their eye sockets blocked off by the host's eyes.  They have greatly improved hearing (compared to bare skeletons, who have no ears), and their proprioception and sense of touch is good enough to tell the difference between a muscle moving a limb and an outside force doing the same.  
       - Breathing and sleep: The host will often have trouble breathing and sleeping with an unskilled or uncooperative skeleton.  Having your ribcage move (or fail to move) out of rhythm with your respiration can be very distressing. Similarly, moving unexpectedly when you are trying to fall asleep can wake up most people.

      All that being said, there are several advantages to Skelemen:

       - Strength and Endurance: The strength from the muscles and the strength from the spirit animating the skeleton can be added together (when the two minds coordinate efforts), resulting in new Skelemen being about 2/3 stronger than they previously were.  The skeletal strength can also be used to keep the muscles completely fresh and rested on long marches, even to the point of many veteran Skelemen being able to sleep and eat on their feet to maintain a near-24 hour march rate.
       - Sleep and awareness: Two minds are better than one, they say.  Skelemen get two chances to notice anything going wrong, and the skeleton never gets bored or tired.
       - Intelligence: The animated skeleton benefits from having a (normal) human intelligence guide it, allowing much better use of its abilities.
       - Magic Resistance: the skeleton's spirit benefits from the protective effects of being surrounded by a living human, which blocks all but the most powerful magics. (*Fireball* is easy, *Explode Liver* is hard.  *Dispel Skeleton* is easy, *Dispel Skeleton In A Person* is hard.)

  So I've got this idea that I think is excellent, but have continuously failed to make a worthy story with. Mentioned it in last week's thread, but not as a top level comment.

  So there are these portals that, upon activation, split the universe in two (like a quantum event), and the portal in universe A connects with the portal in universe B. Using multiple portals would allow for the creation of infinite computers that span infinite universes.

  There'd also be a variation that's activated twice (well, half the time): the first activation splits the universe and does nothing in universe A, and the second activation in universe A causes the portal in universe A to link with the portal in universe B at the moment of the first activation.

  Finally, there'd be some kind of ability that causes someone to immediately evaporate in any newly-formed universe B - from everyone else's perspective they evaporate rapidly with very high probability, but from their perspective they can use the portals to copy the universe without copying themselves, giving them as much of any limited resource as they want.
  ```

  - u/Dwood15:
    ```
    I think a possible problem with this is that the premise starts on such a massive scale as copying universes. Perhaps if you created smaller abilities/scifi stuff that could be scaled into the universe splitting? It's difficult to keep a story insteresting if you immediately start your character off with this level of power.

    For example, for my wishing story or the mana burning, I would focus on an individual character's interaction with the world and discovery, and then scale them into the full power.
    ```

  - u/GaBeRockKing:
    ```
    I'm going to second the "scale too big" reply. It *would* make a good story, but the level of skill and effort required would make it *extremely* difficult to do so. I remember seeing a webcomic sort of similar (a device is created that splits the universe every 2 weeks, but one person can experience the same things as their alternate selves) and it just exploded in complexity by the 40 strip mark.

  Let's say that you have two substances, both some interesting properties, which become much more interesting in combination.

  Wodzite is stone-like substance (most abundant in comets, and regions dense in ice), as well as occasionally in the coronae and coronal ejecta of red dwarfs, translucent and colorless. It has thermal and phase characteristics nearly identical to pure corundum, and behaves similarly on a chemical level, but is starkly non-reactive with respect redox reactions, is a strong electric insulator, and is highly transparent. It also appears to be intangible with respect to water molecules, which permeate and flow through its volume as though it were a vacuum (aside from the pressure of other water molecules also present inside the wodzite). Additionally, when water flows through wodzite, the wodzite emits a toroidal 'virtual water' field, which has virtual pressure and temperature proportionate to that of the water within the generating wodzite, with a scaling factor determined by the flow of the water through the wodzite and the volume of the emitted field (which is in turn determined by the size and shape of the wodzite itself).

  Meanwhile, an island-isotope of Livermorium (generally as a small admixture to a highly corrosion and temperature resistant alloy), can contain the field emitted by wodzite, and is itself largely unaffected by that field.

  Anything immediately jump out for this system, or similar systems, subbing water out for another simple chemical?
  ```

  - u/MugaSofer:
    ```
    Can Livermorium channel the field in a particular direction? Like, if I have a Livermorium sheathe around my piece of water-pressurized wodzite, and there's a gap in it, what happens?

    This would be very useful for contain antimatter and other highly-dangerous substances. High enough water pressure would create a vacuum around the material without any solid barrier around it, might make certain chemistry easier.

    I assume this follows conservation of energy? There's a lot of "proportional to"-s in there, but you said that water flows as if in a vacuum, which suggests there's no resistance.
    ```

    - u/Aabcehmu112358:
      ```
      Livermorium doesn't reduce the overall volume of the wodzite field unless it completely encloses it (specifically, as long as it doesn't have any holes large enough for water molecules to get through), the remaining volume sort of 'extends' the whatever portion is unblocked, ballooning it out and distorting it from its original shape into a sort of hemisphere-cone shape.

      I suppose flow rate is not exactly the right phrasing, but my point was to say that energy is conserved, IE that the energy you put into moving the water through the wodzite is equal to the energy the virtual water field is able to effect its contents with. Does that work? Maybe not. It might work better if we say that wodzite saps half the kinetic energy from water flowing through it, and that kinetic energy goes into the field, which I guess would mean there is some resistance.
      ```
