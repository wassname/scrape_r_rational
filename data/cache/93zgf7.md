  I didn't know there was non-magical hp fanfic.

  After reading the first ten chapters I don't think I'm going to continue this. A lot of the first part of it seems to be just forcing the hp plot in a super spy school, and at a lot moments come off as weird.

  The writing is ok, and it does have a lot good ideas. I think it would be way better rewrite without all the hp stuff, maybe also age the characters a few years?

  OK, I've read the first five chapters. Writing style seems solid, very few errors that I noticed, the conversion from magic to SF seems pretty smooth and shows some cleverness.

  It's just...not grabbing me? I'm not feeling any particular hook. The author has clearly put in effort and has talent, the story has value as a "look what you can do with this", but I'm having a hard time getting into it.

  This is a long but fantastic read, and easily the best "reimagine the setting" fic I've read in years.  A reviewer puts it well:

  > This universe has absolutely no magic, but super-science can create some similar results, and biochemicals can cause mutations that create superheroes and supervillains (although that wouldn't become public during this story's timeline). This is also a James Bond crossover, so expect that level of violence.’  And you might find that my characters are subtly different enough from Rowling’s writing that your preconceived notions may not apply.

  In other words: this is medium-hardness SF, with a huge dose of historical and technical fact, stirred well with espionage both real and imagined.

    This looks good and I'll definitely check it out. Would you recommend the author's other stories on the website?

      I'd strongly recommend starting with this one, and maybe go back to her earlier work if you want to explore the wider setting.

      (this is part four in a sprawling multiverse, most recently published but still a prequel. Personally I just ignored the whole series thing because it stands perfectly well along and I didn't want to read the others.)

    do we need to read the other books in thwe A Brane of Extraordinary Women series?

      Nope, this is fully stand-alone - I haven't read the others and loved this one!
      ```
