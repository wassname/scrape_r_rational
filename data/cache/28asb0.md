  I've been trying to make this one work for a couple days, and it's just not doing it. I'd like some advice on what's wrong with it, if anyone has some advice to offer.

  I really like the core idea, which is that (spoilers if you've come to the comments first) the Star Trek universe is inconsistent, and someone who is oblivious to the fact that they're in a simulation stumbles on those inconsistencies. I like the idea of a universe built by the lowest bidder with a bunch of things that were just hastily patched and not designed to survive scrutiny. And I think I also like the idea of someone living in a simulation trying to break free into the "real" world.

  But I don't know that I know how to write this, and I'm not really sure that I know where I'm going with the story as yet. Originally I'd intended to just end it with him finding his twin, but I don't think that's a satisfactory conclusion, because the central conflict is that Beckham is a "realist".

  Oh, and I don't know whether the story would be better or worse if it were just set on the Enterprise with Wesley as the protagonist and a bunch of extreme fans playing at being Picard/Riker/Data, etc.

  Any advice would be appreciated, thanks.

    Well, it's all dialogue-exposition. Maybe that's the problem. Maybe it's too much information just dumped out and needs to be eased into. Or maybe the opposite - if you don't want to fart about before hitting the punchline so you can start the story proper, you might need to drop the reader in with far less explanation and let them pick up the pieces.

    For me, I would have been able to keep up with far, far less preamble. But you'd need to choose who your audience is to make that call.

    EDIT: That said, I didn't actually think it was that bad. Just trying to think how it could be improved for me.

    I liked it! Greg Egan had [a similar idea](http://subterraneanpress.com/magazine/winter_2014/bit_players_by_greg_egan), which IMHO means you're doing something right. 

    I think what you have here functions perfectly well as a one-shot, and could be released as such without much work (certainly the closing lines work fine). If you want to continue it, though, I think you need to do some more work. How does the story continue from here? Either Beckham breaks out of the simulation quickly, or he doesn't. 

    -If he does, then you need to do much more to establish the broader upload culture. The basics given here work fine for a story of this length, but if Beckham is moving out into the Overmind we'll need more info. Now you don't get to lean on Star Trek canon. And the Overmind-style story has already been done really well before, e.g. in [Diaspora](http://www.amazon.com/Diaspora-Greg-Egan/dp/0575082097), so you'd need to come up with more ideas.  

    -If he doesn't, you've given yourself a bit of a problem. There's a tension between the point of the story (Beckham has to break out quickly) and the meta-point of the story (pointing out all of the inconsistencies in Star Trek). If you want to pursue the latter (which was the interesting part for me, and I thought was done really well--I love the idea of looking through the source code for the transporters/replicators), you might be better served by setting up a typical Groundhog Day-style loop where Beckham comes to learn more and more about the exploits in the situation (which gives you lots of room to add more Star Trek stuff) and eventually breaks out, ending the story. To get that to work you could change the retcon mechanism--instead of Beckham's mother wiping his memories, the whole simulation is simply rolled back to before its fictionality was revealed (but after the transporter accident, presumably). But then you'd have to sacrifice the whole original-humans-discriminating-against-software aspect, which is a pity.

    Actually, I think it looks complete as it is.

  I think I've determined what it is that I don't like about this story: It doesn't actually benefit at all from being "Star Trek" related.

  In the beginning of the story, we are presented with a world that is clearly "Fan Fiction, set in the world of Star Trek". References to Star Trek are made, extrapolations about the implications of various technologies are made, and explanations for inconsistencies are derived.

  Then, the story takes a sharp turn. It gives up on its premise. It decides that there is no way in which to reconcile the inconsistencies, and so it becomes an entirely different story: You have not been reading "Fan Fiction, set in the world of Star Trek", you have actually been reading "Science Fiction, set in the world full of people playing-out Star Trek Fan Fiction". There is no-longer any point to there having been Star Trek references in the beginning of the story. One can't use knowledge of Star Trek to extrapolate information about the world, so there was no point in mentioning it.
