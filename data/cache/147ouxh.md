      Basically, imagine two or more authors conveying a story entirely via forum posts where they're roleplaying characters. Quite fun for the authors from what I gather, but not for the audience in my opinion. You know how most browsers have a reader mode, where they strip out the extraneous bits and just let you read? Imagine the inverse, a bulletin board mode where it takes a streamlined story and inserts in all the fluff from a forum, severely interrupting immersion and reading flow. 

      Nothing personal against anyone who writes or enjoys glowfics, they're just really not for me.

  Wanted to review some things on RR. All of them have been on here at some point so probably nothing new to most people.

  The Game at Carousel: really good, 5/5 so far. Very interested to see where this goes. If you haven't tried this, check it out. It's people stuck in a kind of game thing, forced to play out horror films. The MC has gone through quite a few at this point, and I enjoyed all of them - some satisfying little mysteries in the horror films, some great parodying of tropes. Then there is the background setting between the films, which is getting fleshed out more and more in really interesting and unexpected ways. One of the reasons I'm so confident this will continue to be great and have satisfying answers to the setting's larger questions is that I've really enjoyed the resolutions to the smaller mysteries, like the ones within the films. There is clearly a lot of thought going into these moments from early on, so I have a lot of faith that the ongoing questions aren't just mystery boxes. Highly recommended.

  Super Supportive: very good. This is getting posted here regularly now so I'll be brief. Superhero fantasy. It's slightly weird that the most recent arc is so long, but I'm really enjoying it so won't complain. Love the worldbuilding, so many questions, so many good answers so far as well. Similar to above - the author has already delivered worldbuilding details I love, so the ones they're hinting at I am excited to learn about. The story has changed a few times what it seems (to me) to be about/aiming for, and the most recent few chapters are quite different again imo. Stories that are less strong would be in danger of losing themselves but I think this one is just playing with us.

  Magical Girl Gunslinger: pretty badly-executed misery porn. I read it out of fascination and would continue if there were chapter updates, but I can't recommend it. It has evil characters who are Just Evil, good guys that are Just So Good, and the MC who everyone loves, who is soo selfless and she doesn't even realize it. Just pure wank.

  The Last Orellen: love the worldbuilding, love the premise, want to love the plot, but nothing has happened in the entire story so far! One update a week and every time I feel like there must be plot progress but no, it's like it's determined to stick to slice of life even though the MC has specific goals they need to achieve fairly urgently. I'm totally hooked, but I feel a bit frustrated every time. In the future we can maybe look back on this and cast it as a "slow burn", but right now it feels like a "no burn". The slice of life is great, though. It's just not what I feel like the story needs. Recommended with that caveat.

  Doing God's Work: great, nearing the end, I think this deserves more popularity. 100% up this sub's alley. It's descending into chaos a bit now, and updates are infrequent enough that I have trouble remembering exactly what's going on (and who all the gods are). But really funny, it starts small and then oh boy does it escalate. Great plot. 10/10 (except for the very end which hasn't happened yet, withholding judgement).

  The Flower that Bloomed Nowhere: fantasy murder mystery, insane and weird worldbuilding, great, worth binging. Probably *better* to binge because it's extremely complicated and my memory isn't amazing. Also nearing the end, and also getting quite complicated. Not as "exciting" as DGW, but probably more cerebrally stimulating.

  The Menocht Loop: interesting, but dropped a while ago when the MC and friends decide to cast their lot in with some woman and act as mercenaries/soldiers for her. Might be misremembering. Anyway it felt like the MC was just doing it because they liked whoever the other person was, and that was just because the author liked them. To me it felt counterproductive to the MC's actual goals, and like it lost the plot a bit. Can anyone tell me it's justified or it gets better?

  Only Villains Do That: ugh, the morality. The MC is kind of unlikeable, but that's not an issue when other people call him out (which is most of the time). No, it's when all the characters agree in one voice on certain things that 1. I think are dumb, and 2. even if I agreed there would be some variation among actual people, surely? This is mostly noticeable when he goes on about how bad guys aren't always bad, but you can split them into "bad by circumstance" and "bad by nature". My dude, have you heard of a spectrum? Nuance? I don't mind him murdering people and being like "ya I'm evil" (or "you looked guilty and I wasn't gonna just let you go"), but this faux justification really stinks, especially when all other characters vocally buy into it. Just feels like the author gracelessly shoving themselves in the story to justify that the MC isn't *really* a baddie. Am I being unfair? Does this get better?

      Yeah you are actually right about that, the characters are basically vacant. I think I was thinking 5/5 for how hooked I am on the plot and it kinda blinded me to the missing elements.

      I even remember reading this chapter there's a bit where Riley notes that Antoine is "usually the talkative one but now he was quiet so we all knew something was wrong". I was like, woah, is Antoine an outgoing kind of guy? I didn't realize that about him. I assumed it was just me not paying attention but honestly all the characters are unknowns like this.

      I'm not sure I would even buy the "just their tropes" thing. It seems more like Riley (or the author?) being uninterested in other people to the extent we never get a good view of them.

      I still back my recommendation though - I think as long as you're reading it for the plot you'll enjoy it loads, it's just not great (so far) for forming deep connections with the characters.

      Except Silas, Silas is great :)

    ```
    Regarding Only Villains Do That, I recall multiple occasions where people point out the fallacy in Seiji's justifications for violence, particularly some goblins, the paladin character, the squirrels, etc.

    In the early parts of the story, Seiji's faction is mostly made up of downtrodden victims who buy into his misanthropic moralizing because his message of revenge and overthrowing oppressors appeals to them. The other factions he interacts with later tend to have a more nuanced view and rightly call him out on his bad habit of reductive moral judgement and violence as his go-to solution. The most recent arc of the story especially forces Seiji into contact with people who prove the fault in his moral reasoning, and he is grudgingly having to adjust his mindset.

    Webbonomicon is fully aware of how wack Seiji's reasoning is, as shown by an author note in the most recent story arc describing Seiji's mindset thus: "*In which the Dark Lord evolves from smug redditor to 4chan edgelord*"

    Suffice to say, this is *definitely not* a story where the MC is the voice of the author.
    ```

    - u/Haplostemonous:
      ```
      > I recall multiple occasions where people point out the fallacy in Seiji's justifications for violence

      I actually didn't mind his justifications (except where they went on for ages like the author expected us to take them seriously). Maybe the story just wants to be more character-driven and philosophical than I think it should be.

      > In the early parts of the story, Seiji's faction is mostly made up of downtrodden victims who buy into his misanthropic moralizing because his message of revenge and overthrowing oppressors appeals to them.

      Ok, thanks for letting me know. I was probably still in this initial bit. I got up to where >!he'd dealt with the goblin king, and come to a sort of truce with the hero guy I think, there was some wolf people vs other animal people tribal dispute, and it seemed like a new arc was starting.!< I don't know why but that was when this villain-worship stuff started bothering me enough to give up.

      > The other factions he interacts with later tend to have a more nuanced view

      Exciting! Do you remember if this gets happens soon after where I stopped? If so I'll pick it back up, it was a fun read.

        >Maybe the story just wants to be more character-driven and philosophical than I think it should be.

        Seiji's growth as a person and interaction with his allies has been a central aspect of the story thus far, so I think the author will always maintain the character-driven focus. Personally, Seiji's development and his philosophical butting-of-heads is my favorite part of the story.

        There's actually been several spots in the story pointing out the wrongness of Seiji's judgement/violence before your current stopping point:

        * >!The several occasions, starting in [2.14](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/40182/only-villains-do-that/chapter/765419/214-in-which-the-dark-lord-is-the-lesser-evil) when people point out Seiji's similarity to the megalomaniacal, sadistic Archlord Caludon or say that Caludon would like his methods. Seiji is repulsed by the comparisons and feels growing self-doubt, which proves well founded when he finally gets Caludon's personal attention in the current arc.!<

        * >!Rhydion disagrees about the nature of 'evil' at the wake, and he attempts to dissuade Seiji's revenge on Uncle Gently in [2.16](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/40182/only-villains-do-that/chapter/768879/216-in-which-the-dark-lord-suffers-the-little). Rhydion's argument is not naive, but is rather based on his extensive personal experience. Later in the story Rhydion's words are proven true again and again when Seiji's violence repeatedly leads to further escalation rather than solving his problems. An especially notable example is his provocation of Lady Grey which caused many deaths in Cat Alley, then amongst the Gutter Rats, and later the deaths of people in his fortress. His actions also drew Caludon's attention, leading to the jackbooted crackdown on the gutters and to further sadistic developments in the current arc. Seiji's torture of the Goblin King's emissary without understanding their cultural context lit the fire of their civil war which decimated their society.!<

        * >!Seiji feels internal turmoil, growing doubt, and lingering guilt when his grandstanding about revenge to drum up support leads to executing many men on pure hearsay in [2.30](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/40182/only-villains-do-that/chapter/807725/230-in-which-the-dark-lord-gets-his-hands-dirty) and [2.31](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/40182/only-villains-do-that/chapter/818541/231-in-which-the-dark-lord-battens-down-the-hatches).!<

        * >!On multiple occasions Seiji's one-dimensional moral judgements about people are proven false, and his worldview gradually gets less cynical as a result. He finally starts trusting Biribo rather than assuming he is on Virya's side after [1.26](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/40182/only-villains-do-that/chapter/671742/126-in-which-the-dark-lord-gets-hot-and-steamy). His assumption that all of Dount's nobility are evil is proven false in when he meets Clan Yviredh in [2.25](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/40182/only-villains-do-that/chapter/789911/225-in-which-the-dark-lord-comes-to-dinner). There are other examples, but I don't want to get even more long winded.!<

        The current arc contains many situations in which Seiji must restrain his violent judgements because he finally faced the fact that his faction won't survive further escalation. There's also more moments when Seiji's black and white assumptions are proven false, such as when >!a person he 'saved' is ungrateful rather than acting like Seiji's followers!<. These factors, combined with more important Rhydion conversations, show how wrong Seiji's mindset is.

        You seem to have stopped reading around 4.6(?). These developments, along with the new allies I mentioned, start coming into play around 4.9.

    I've been on a bit of a xianxia binge lately. 

    [Unintended Cultivator](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/67362/unintended-cultivator-a-xianxia-inspired-cultivation) is a pretty  recent one. It's got a much more standard take on xianxia. Pretty slow paced (he finishes his first training arc around chapter 60), but well written.

    [Transcending Dreams](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/65765/transcending-dreams-litrpg-xianxia) has the MC have a xianxia-litrpg system. MC is ~~a bit of~~ a dumbass.

    [Slumrat Rising](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/65801/slumrat-rising) is xianxia-adjacent, as it's set in a cyberpunkish setting. *Very* well written.

    [Dao of the Web](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/68602/dao-of-the-web) is a bit of a shitpost, but I'm enjoying it.

    [Spire Dweller](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/39069/spire-dweller) is xianxia + litrpg + tower climbing. Good popcorn.

    For some older (dead?) stuff:

    [The Essence of Cultivation](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/34710/the-essence-of-cultivation) is a fic about a fantasy (D&D style) mage getting isekai'd to xianxialand. Pretty good.

    [Cultivating Earth](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25962/cultivating-earth) follows a cultivator who fled to a prehistoric Earth to finalize his ascendance to true immortality. He wakes up and finds modern Earth, and decides to set up a Sect.

    [A Sect Elder's Journey](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/65919/a-sect-elders-journey-xianxia-isekai) has a random guy isekai'd into the head of a Sect Elder. The Sect Elder is also happens to be a demonic cultivator infiltrating the sect he's in.

      As a warning, *Unintended Cultivator* is the *Faraway Paladin* but with a layer of Xianxia spray paint over, and it also has a bloated and meandering prose.

      I found it okay to binge on my commute, but quickly dropped it once I caught up; individual chapters lack any real substance. Even if it had a better pace, I probably would have moved on soon because every single villain character up to my stopping point has been bland, one dimensional and uninteresting.

  - u/Sirra-:
    ```
    It’s probably worth noting that with last week’s release of Waybound, the [Cradle series](https://www.goodreads.com/series/192821-cradle) is now complete.
    ```

    - u/GrizzlyTrees:
      ```
      Cradle's plot and MCs run on a combination of relatively rational "really trying" (and being willing to "cheat" to succeed), a bit of shonen logic (face your impossible trials and succeed through determination and grit), and a sprinkling of "meet a powerful person who likes you and is willing to help a bit" on top. However, most characters behave very consistently, the worldsbuilding is pretty good, and the humor and emotional beats hit pretty well. Anyone who's ever liked a shonen anime like Bleach or Naruto would probably love it (it feels like a good shonen anime), and there's none of the usual decay of quality as the stakes go higher. From a writing perspective there is very little fat there, the story progresses quickly and with very little words wasted, most books in the series are short relative to modern epic fantasy. The series overall is a very fun and relatively quick read (the audiobook is also very goos). 

      One last note, the first book starts in a way that seem to imply a certain kind of plot for the series, especially if you've read Xianxia/cultivation before, and it is also relatively slow. It's not very representative of the whole of the series, and if it repulses you a bit, I suggest powering through until at least the middle of the book, from where you can start to see hints of the true direction of the plot, and the pace picks up quite a bit.
      ```

      - u/derefr:
        ```
        > and a sprinkling of "meet a powerful person who likes you and is willing to help a bit" on top

        The first one is "fate." But every time after that, it's actually the result of someone *intentionally pursuing* a connection to a powerful person — which is also a very rational act, especially in the kind of world they're in. (The first one, Lindon meeting Yerin, is obvious to the reader; every connection after that, though, is Eithan nudging two people into meeting where neither intends to meet the other but Eithan intends the two to form a bond. These are much less obvious to the reader as they're happening — but no less intentional.)
        ```

        - u/GrizzlyTrees:
          ```
          This is mostly true from the outside perspective, but from Lindon's perspective it just so happens that his first lucky encounter points him towards a particularly well fitting second encounter, which helps him reach the third "lucky" encounter. The universe being the way that it is is good for him, and that is luck. After all, a universe without Yerin exactly there at the right time would be as consistent, and so would (mostly) a universe without Eithan. After the "lucky" initial conditions, most of the rest is things flowing naturally without particularly egregious amounts of luck.

        I didn't feel it went downhill so much as I felt that the story kinda reached its potential and ended off on a nice note instead of dragging it out forever. The first few books flew by because of the sheer inertia and lack of fat in the writing, but by book 9 ish I realized that this would never be the type of xianxia where we get to spend a lot of time on characterization or lore or worldbuilding. I think from that perspective it achieved everything it set out to do, and finished at a nice point.

    It bills itself as being a cliche harem story, but it's far more interesting than that.  It also has only half-jokingly hinted at harem elements so far, which suits me just fine.

    The plot and narration start out very simple when the MC is a child, but the whole thing takes on a dry humor as the MC ages that I really like.

    The MC is presented as smart, but unfortunately not in a "the reader can solve the problem along with the MC" kind of way.  Still, I'm having fun with it.

    I'll also second "Slumrat Rising" posted by someone else, though it's more of a mish-mash of several kinds of fantasy and magic-punk rather than a pure cultivation story.

    [Wuxia World](https://www.wuxiaworld.com/) has a lot of good and well translated novels and is where I have done most of my cultivation novel reading. Beware of Chicken is not a typical cultivation novel, you may be better off looking on royalroad for slice of life stories.

    Child of Light has a lighter tone that might be more inline with Beware of Chicken.

    Desolate Era and [A Record of a Mortal's Journey to Immortality](https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/rmji) are two of my favorite. A Mortal's Journey is the better and more rational one.

    Now that I think about it [Divine Throne of Primordial Blood](https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/divine-throne-of-primordial-blood) is probably the most rational  cultivation/xianxia novel I know of and is a good read. But some of its pay off comes from already being familiar with the tropes.

    Immortal Mortal,  and Warlock of the Magus World are also good.

    Calculating Cultivation on royalroad has been a decent read so far.

    Refining the Mountains and Rivers and Ancient Strengthening Technique have good reviews but I have just not gotten into them.

    Emperor's Domination and Nine Star Hegemon Body Art are good if you want a lot of  over powered MC face slapping but they abandon what rationality the genre tends to  have.

    Martial World, Talisman Emperor, Against the Gods, and Battle Through the Heavens are not the worst but I only finished Martial World.

    [The Game Maker's Toolkit ](https://youtube.com/@GMTK) it's offers essays on video game design and how certain games created clever ways to overcome certain obstacles that typically plaque various genre of games. Even if you're not into gaming it's still interesting to watch for the problem solving aspect. Honestly watching alot of the essays, I get strong rationalist vibes even though it's not trying to be. Of particular note that I like best from the channel are these yearly game jam contests, in which a "theme with a twist" is given and hundreds of game creators have to make a low budget game out of it. It's interesting to see all different directions people take the theme. It's like munchkinning an idea but by making a game out of it.

    Two minute papers- machine learning ai discover clever ways to overcome tasks among other things.

    I second the rec for Issac Authur. He gives the best in depth analysis of the Fermi paradox I've seen to date.

    Some other recs for casual viewing: Rational Animations, thunk, Scam Nation, Media Zealot, ted ed, Mark Rober, Veritasium, Kurzgesagt.

    Someone recommended the podcast "[Flash Forward](https://www.flashforwardpod.com/)" on here a while back, and while I haven't listened to a *ton* of it, I'd give it a cautious recommendation aligning with what you're looking for. 

    Basically, each episode takes some (usually scifi) premise and then the host plays with it a bit, talking to subject matter specialists and creating fake adverts or other "digital epistolary" in order to immerse the listener in the scenario (which are often quite fun). 

    Rationalism isn't really a main focus though, and when listening it's not uncommon for me to disagree with the take(s) presented or have a different take on the topic. That said, I still think it's pretty good at getting me to think about things I don't normally think about and the host, Rose, makes it fun.

  Repasting my comment from last week since I didn't get any suggestions.

  So I'm really craving some good Lovecraftian/Cosmic/Eldritch Horror. Just finished Paulus Somni and it was perfection. It was as if I was reading Bloodborne distilled into a story about one of the churches in Yharnam before the events of the game take place.

  Also just finished Darkworlds by Tony Walker and while it wasn't the best two books the descriptions of Madness were fantastic. Don't want HFY, no figuring out the secrets. I want the real horror stuff.

    There is [A Colder War](http://www.infinityplus.co.uk/stories/colderwar.htm), an alternate history where Instead of just nuclear weapons the cold war powers learn to summon eldritch horrors and engage in M.A.D. strategies with them.
    ```

  - u/CaramilkThief:
    ```
    [Underland](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/47557/underland) by Maxime Durand is as bloodborne as it gets, although it's a fairly light work compared with other eldritch horror stuff. A wizard in an underground society (that runs on Blood) has dreams of a world where the surface is livable and the sun exists. He tries to turn those dreams into reality by doing some necromancy. Completed and on Kindle Unlimited. 

    Ah you want the real horror stuff, my bad. Maybe check out [Darkwood](https://store.steampowered.com/app/274520/Darkwood/)? Slavic survival horror video game with barely any jumpscares and a lot of eldritch horror. Really good game with a nice story. 

    Cultist Simulator and its sister game Fallen London both have a nice dose of eldritch/cosmic horror, although the stories in those games are sort of episodic. 

    Song of Saya is a visual novel with some good biological horror. Also contains some horrific content, so warnings for that. Written by Gen Urobuchi.

  Two recommendations and a request.

  [Calculating Cultivation](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/67803/calculating-cultivation) has a MC rationally pursuing the not so rational goal of ultimate power. Its new but well written and updates 3 times a week. It is an isekia but no annoying pop culture references. It has the most "realistic" case of using real world knowledge to become reach in a fantasy setting that I have seen. The cultivation is very mechanistic instead of mystical but it is better thought out than many. My main complaint is that the MC takes rational actions that avoid a lot of what could have been plot in other novels. This leaves a lack of action that the author doesn't cover for in other areas.  6/10.

  [The Weirkey Chronicles](https://www.goodreads.com/series/306753-the-weirkey-chronicles) is well written and planned out characters. The story has good foreshadowing, characters and worldbuilding consistent and thought out, and I do enjoy the magic system. It has 6 published books, the 7th is not far off, and is planned to go 10+ books. It is a progression story but proceeds at a decent clip and does not get bogged down in junk.  8/10, but it is really scratching a particular itch for me.

  The progression system is each character collects magical materials that they can pull into their soul and build a soul home to give them powers. I really like the physicality of the system, doe anyone have a similar magic system they can recommend?
  ```

  - u/FourBlueRobots:
    ```
    I'm not up-to-date on Calculating Cultivation, but I'll give an anti-rec:

    * MC is going against standard practice and the knowledge of the cultivation world. MC is not particularly well-researched and has no reason to believe they know better than the experts. MC doesn't even have a fully developed plan for solving some of the known issues before committing to his approach. It makes no sense to proceed with his plan. He will succeed and the story will act like he was rational, but he is not being smart.

    * Cultivation system is mostly word-salad. Mechanics aren't explained. MC just has a random plan and an explanation of why that plan makes sense, saying things like "the four cores will balance each other out", without an explanation of the base issue that his plan is addressing. There are tons of these details without really being clear what those details are addressing. Mildly annoying as well that the solution to most things is "triangles".

    * Business part is overly simple and uninteresting IMO. Again, it is too clearly set up for MC to succeed with the most minimal of obstacles.

  [Riley Alone](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/riley-alone-complete.1063889/) just finished yesterday.

  It’s about Bonesaw from Worm losing Jack and having to come to terms with, like, existing as a person. It’s really sweet at times, other times it’s exactly as fucked up as anything involving Bonesaw implies, and sometimes it’s both.

      Standard AU of Harry in Slytherin and Neville replacing him in the Golden Trio. He sets himself up as a deal maker and supplier of goods/services of sorts and you basically interact with another AU of the Potterverse through Harry while he operates from this role.

      The plot starts around the start of fifth year so a lot of information is conveyed through the characters and how they interact with one another. Harry functions with an almost morally defunct and somewhat rationalist mindset and the start of the fic seems promising.
      ```

    - u/vaphyren:
      ```
      Featuring Slytherin Harry with BWL Neville, with Harry running some sort of mercenary/information broker business on the side with magically binding contracts during 5th year. Surprisingly good writing, but I won't characterize anything in the story as particularly unique. 

      It's heavy on the wish-fulfillment and not particularly rational. Some characters are too sociopathic to be believable, but that's quite common with Slytherin Harry. Too early to tell if it develops into something promising or it's just setting up mystery boxes.

  Any good or interesting polyamory or harem romances? 

  Preferably something like [AnimeCon Harem](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21414/animecon-harem), which has been a hell of a smutty read. It's finishing up soon with the author writing the epilogues now, so I'm looking for a similar fix with plot and lots of relationship interplay, great dialogue, and  enough rationality in the characters' perspectives and thought processes that the story doesn't veer into hardcore wish fulfillment or porn logic. Reader beware though, AnimeCon Harem is erotica with wild amounts of lewdness and sexual adventure.

  Forgot to mention trigger warnings: the story has traumatic topics.
  ```

  - u/CaramilkThief:
    ```
    I much prefer polyamory to harem, so here are a few stories where I thought it was executed well. They won't all be romances though. 

    [Marked for Death](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/marked-for-death-a-rational-naruto-quest.24481/) is a rational naruto fanfic/quest that has been ongoing for a long time. It is one of my favorite pieces of media and it still updates twice weekly. Due to quest format the pacing suffers, but I'll say that there's very little content that isn't meaningful. Several of the main relationships are unconventional, and the protagonist has a polyamorous relationship where a lot of effective communication happens. They're all still teens though, and so there's no smut. 

    [Frameshift](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/46378/frameshift-magic-math-and-not-enough-context) starts with a typical harem premise but there's a lot of philosophizing and some good character writing. Has a polyamorous relationship with a bi protagonist, I think. Also contains smut. 

    [The Daily Grind](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/15925/the-daily-grind) is quite cool. Office worker discovers an office space dimension hidden in his office building, and explores it and finds SCP esque loot. Iirc the protagonist gets into a polyamorous relationship with a man and a woman from his DnD group. Pretty wholesome stuff. Not smutty. 

    [Motion Sickness](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13697675/1/Motion-Sickness-V2) is a rwby fanfic where Jaune turns into OP Cloud Strife expy from Final Fantasy. It's...good? Maybe? First person stream of consciousness, but very raw and unfiltered. We get all of his intrusive thoughts, dirty thoughts, self recrimination, internal monologue, etc. Grammar and spelling isn't great, but sometimes it works surprisingly well. The story is sort of all over the place but imo the characters stand out. There is a polyamorous relationship between Jaune, Ruby and Weiss and I thought it was quite sweet. Contains smut. 

    [Astielle](https://kittyunpretty.com/astielle/) is like Legend of Zelda but Link, Zelda, and Ganondorf get together. I haven't read it, but looking at some excerpts seems quite smutty. It was recommended here quite a while ago, I've been meaning to pick it up.

  Recommend me some fun or interesting prompts for ChatGPT-4 involving rational fiction characters or settings. By way of example, I prompted it with "Juniper Smith (Worth the Candle) goes on a blind date with Asuka Langley. Lots of dialogue. First person POV.":

  > My name's Juniper Smith, and I'm a protagonist straight from the strange world of a cosmic horror story. My life's a wild ride, to say the least. So, when Fel Seed (a creature that was part-human, part-horror show) suggested I take a break from all the metaphysical mayhem, I considered it. Blind dates aren't really my style, but in the name of not being entirely antisocial, I said yes.
  > 
  > The venue is a bustling little restaurant, somewhere on the edges of reality. It's in one of those universes that are so wildly different from mine, that even the sushi is more mathematical equation than raw fish. I've been waiting here, twiddling my thumbs and contemplating the abstract art of trans-universe dating when she walked in.
  > 
  > "Asuka Langley," she introduced herself. She's in a stylish red dress that somehow matched her fiery hair, with a strikingly confident and somewhat challenging look in her blue eyes.
  > 
  > "Juniper Smith," I responded, standing to greet her. "Nice to meet you, Asuka."
  > 
  > She made a soft huff, reminding me of a disgruntled cat. "A blind date, huh? You don't look like much."
  > 
  > I couldn't help but chuckle. Asuka was direct, and I appreciated it. "Well, you know what they say about books and their covers."
  > 
  > "I do," she shot back quickly. "But the cover can often give you a good idea about what's inside."
  > 
  > "Guess you'll find out tonight, won't you?" I retorted, with a half-smile.
  > 
  > She mirrored my smile. "Guess I will."
  > 
  > Dinner was... interesting. The menu items seemed to constantly shift and change, and deciding on something felt more like a complex game of chess than picking a meal. Asuka seemed unfazed by the oddity. She told me about piloting an Evangelion, and about her turbulent relationship with her father.
  > 
  > In turn, I shared my own stories. I told her about my journeys, my bizarre powers, and the strangeness of my reality. At one point, she blinked at me, tilting her head. "You're making that up."
  > 
  > I raised an eyebrow at her, grinning. "Would I lie to you, Asuka?"
  > 
  > "Yes," she said flatly. "You would."
  > 
  > "But I'm not."
  > 
  > A pause. A look of consideration. "Fine, then. Let's say I believe you. That makes you some kind of... hero?"
  > 
  > "Something like that," I answered.
  > 
  > She laughed then, a rich, full sound. "So the blind date is with a superhero. Guess this wasn't such a waste after all."
  > 
  > "Well, I wouldn't call myself a superhero. More like... an overworked and underprepared guy who's doing his best."
  > 
  > Her laughter faded, but the smile remained. "Still better than most," she admitted.
  > 
  > The evening wore on, shifting from sharing outlandish tales to discussing life, the universe, and everything else. Despite the strange setting and the odd circumstances that brought us together, it felt nice. It was a moment of normalcy, a break from the mayhem.
  > 
  > And, as I walked Asuka out of the restaurant and towards her waiting universe, I found myself hoping that maybe there'd be a next time. Not because I needed it, but because I wanted it.

    This isn't a perfect fit, and it takes a while for the reveal of the "second insert" to happen, but there is [A Gamer in South Blue](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13260401/1/A-Gamer-In-South-Blue).

    Starts out as a "person with the powers of a videogame protagonist inserted into X setting" where X is One Piece.  Relatively well-written as far as the genre goes, but otherwise fairly standard power fantasy stuff.

    >!Pretty late into the story, there are revelations about how the MC got there.  Pretty much, a random powerful being thought it would be amusing.  The problem is that there is a *different* powerful being that loves watching the standard story of one-piece play out.  After the MC starts messing with the standard story, the second powerful being starts interfering to prevent major story changes, putting them and the MC at odds.  Conflict between them is steadily escalating!<

  [Fate Points](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/58682/fate-points) is certainly slow to get started, but I'm enjoying the questions it's been trying to ask about morality. We're right now following an arc about our plucky protagonists on their way to commit intentional genocide, with the short term goal of finding sentient sacrifices so some of their members don't go mad. It raises some interesting questions, at the very least.

  The grammar is a bit irksome, and if lack of commas turns you off, I'd avoid this one. The author acknowledged it's something he's unable to fix, and is looking for software solutions so this might change.

  &#x200B;

  Excerpt:

  >Universe spanning gods ran a regular competition on a world called Existentia where they pitted seven species from different universes all of whom have dominated their home planet against each other.  
  But a straight-out fight would be too simple. Existentia is a living, breathing, impossibly large, magical world with existing empires, secrets, dungeons and trials. The seven races in the current iteration of the competition have their own unique advantages to exploit, but first they have to survive long enough to show their worth.  
  Fate points is a third person single POV litrpg with a unique system and mechanics and strong, complicated side-characters.

    How is he unable to fix the lack of commas? Is he ESL and has no idea about the grammar rules?

      I think the author might be neurodivergent in a way that makes it particularly hard for them to do punctuation right. I'm not 100% sure though. The story isn't quite popular enough for them to justify a full time editor yet, but I'm hoping.

          I'm the author...  

          I don't know why commas are so hard.  I think I never learnt them at school.  About twenty years ago I was in a writing group and the issue was raised and I got some books to help... They didn't work.

          I'm slowly learning various rules from the editors I hire but it's more learning rules rather than understanding.

          I think the difficulty lies in  how my imagination works... I run a stream of words when creating stories in my head but obviously they don't have punctuation.

          It's also genetic because my kids have the same problem.. terrible spelling, but punctuation and tend to skip words when doing school assignments.   

          The good news is editors can fix these problems for me.

            She always thinks its amusing that she is better at grammar than most people, even though she is worse at spelling, haha
