  ```
  Hakram scores a slam dunk. Jeeze, when do I get a murder song written about me.
  ```

  - u/MoralRelativity:
    ```
    I don't know. Do you want to kill as many people as Hakram has? And lose the flesh on one hand?
    ```

    - u/JdubCT:
      ```
      Can't get anywhere in life by -not- becoming a necromantic abomination while being the right hand to a future evil overlord.

      One thing I really like about Hakram is that he has essentially traded a hand for renown, respect, and a toolbox to deal with things he normally could not. It's like one of those magic weapons they talk about, super useful with potential huge drawbacks (if he ever fights a necromancer, but if Apprentice is around who cares about necromancers?)
      ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Is trapping someone in an eviscerated horse what they call a "slam dunk" in Callow? Maybe that's just a Deoraithe colloquialism.
    ```

    - u/JdubCT:
      ```
      Trapping someone in a dead horse then smacking them with a hatchet until they die is. But not in Callow, just Arcadia.
      ```

- u/MoralRelativity:
  ```
  Loved Cat's mature approach here.

  1. Recognising her mistake.

  2. Gathering all her forces rather than going it alone.

  3. Sending Hakram in for the Count and cementing Hakram's rise in power by doing so.

  4. Plotting with the Duchess.

  5. Sending in the Watch immediately once the Count was dead.

  She's learning.
  ```

    ```
    I think my favorite part of this was the new Calernian phrase: "Princely answer".
    ```

- u/hoja_nasredin:
  ```
  previous song was better:

  “The knights will get the glory

  The king will keep his throne

  We won’t be in the story

  Our names will not be known

  So pick up your sword, boy

  Here they come again

  And down here in the mud,

  It’s us who holds the line.”
  ```

  - u/ricree:
    ```
    If I had to pick a favorite, it would probably be the orcish song of the dead from the Balestra interlude.  I loved how the final stanza inverted the meaning of the repetition "Come to die".
    ```
