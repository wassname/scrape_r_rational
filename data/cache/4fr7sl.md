## [Challenge Companion] Cat and Mouse

### Post:

My favorite cat and mouse movies are probably "innocent man on the run" movies, with *The Fugitive* being my favorite. I think it appeals to me mostly because both sides are in the right in their own way; the innocent man needs to prove his innocence, while the lawman has a lawful mandate to bring him in. It's a trope that has a lot of conflict but doesn't *require* anyone to be acting terribly irrationally.

My other favorites are "lovable rogue on the run from the law", namely *Catch Me If You Can*, which more or less actually happened. Less morally defensible than desperately trying to defend yourself against a crime you didn't commit, but generally a whole lot more fun.

I'm afraid I have no rational examples for this one, but would welcome some in the comments.
