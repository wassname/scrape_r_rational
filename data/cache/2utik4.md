  I am getting that feeling I had when I read A Song of Ice and Fire, where I literally wonder every chapter who is going to die off next.  Naruto left Hinata alone with Sai... Lee still back at Leaf...   

  Great job playing up Pein as a dark Naruto.  You chose the perfect time to introduce him and his basic motivations as similar to Naruto's.

  Danzo seems like a obvious culprit for the assassination, from canon we know he has the motives and means. We also know about Orochimaru from canon.  Perhaps they colluded directly or indirectly.

  Congratulations, you've gotten me to the point where I genuinely believe any character might die at any time.  I would remind you to be careful of darkness induced audience apathy (to use the TvTropes terminology), but you've already written the draft and are just editing as you post apparently so I will just hope for the best.

    NOOOOO!

      Hey, its not guaranteed that Sai will take it as his opportunity to strike.  Sure Hinata is alone and he thinks Naruto and Sasuke are tired from sparing each other, but maybe he will wait for another opportunity.  And killing Hinata, she is a fan favorite, the author can't just kill her after giving her so much character development. /s

      Oh crap, I wasn't sure it was going to happen before, but now I've convinced myself.  My only hope is that Hinata figured out something was wrong and manages to take out the ANBU guy herself.

        Let's hope that Danzo is actually a good guy and everything was done by someone else!

        Naruto is obviously going to communicate stuff with Sasuke. Sparring also gives him opportunity to use Byakugan to see what's happening, so he can keep an eye on Hinata too.

  I've just read half of the chapter and I'm not believing what I'm reading. Dude. I'm upset.

    Aww, cheer up! I hope you feel better. :)

      Nope. It got so dark... :(

      bahaha, this is wonderfully inappropriate.

  This is really interesting.

  Wow you basically destroyed the canon plot.  Talking about going off the roles.  This Danzo seems to much more competent then his canon equivalent, he doesn't sound like a fascist sociopathic warmonger.  

  By the way, I don't think that Kakashi is dead yet.  Maybe he's being tortured by Danzo in some dungoen somewhere but not dead.  

  Sai is definetly planning on killing Hinata.  Hope she lives.

    I felt the same way about Kakashi at first. Protagonists can't die offscreen, dying of food poisoning is pretty anticlimactic, he'll probably come back later and be all "Nah. I was just testing you."

    But then I remembered that 2 chapters ago Hinata CRUSHED NEJI TO DEATH, and I decided he was probably gone.

      That's true.  I keep forgetting that the auther is writing a rationalist fanfic, one without any plot armor.  Sort of like a more a more rational ASOIF.
      It would be funny if Naruto ended up dying and his cause was taken up by Lee who was the true protagonist all along.

      I can't wait for more.
      ```

      - u/kaukamieli:
        ```
        I've been thinking of writing a story with this kind of element. The prophecied hero dies, everything gets fucked and some people has to actually do something smart instead of rushing forward thinking the prophecy protects them.
        ```

        - u/Nevereatcars:
          ```
          Immediately rushed to my mental index to give you a pithy "You mean like in X?" and came up blank. Currently lacking access to my physical bookshelves, can anybody help me crush a man's feeling of originality?

          Wow, no, now I feel terrible.
          ```

            ```
            Closest I got is the original backstory to Sanderson's *Mistborn* trilogy, where the prophesied hero died right at the end of his quest so the evil empire wins, books set 1000 years later, but [spoilers](#s " you learn that's not quite what happened. Though what happened was actually closer to what kaukameili was thinking of, since the evil emperor was actually the regular guy trying to step in when he realized that the prophesied hero was going to fail (because the prophesies were lies).")
            ```

- u/eaglejarl:
  ```
  Well that was gratuitous. 

  I understand why you killed Kakashi -- Danzo is evil, you needed a way to demonstrate that that had emotional impact.  Ok fine. Killing Gai offstage as well doesn't serve any visible purpose other than to remove an interesting character and a good source of comic relief. At this point I'm pretty much assuming that a major canon character is going to die every chapter, just to show that it's a crapsack of world.
  ```

  - u/kaukamieli:
    ```
    Killing Kakashi also makes the trio not be able to rely on adult help, so they have to do stuff alone. Gai would most probably be their next jounin of choice. I'm betting he is planning to make them get out of the village for good and turn traitor, which might be much easier to do when you don't have friends fighting against you.

    edit: I never liked Gai and his eternal springtime of youth crap. :D
