## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  ```
  Any obscure but good webnovels not published in RR, AO3, FF.net, spacebattles, sufficient velocity, questionable questing, or Kindle Unlimited. Basically stuff that's self hosted, like:

  * [City of Roses](http://thecityofroses.com/contents): Urban fae fantasy (possibly lesbian too?) written in present tense. Really good writing but for some reason never got into it.

  * [Symbiote](https://farmerbob1.wordpress.com/): One of the early rational fics that almost never get recommended here. The premise is that the protagonist wakes up with a symbiote sharing his mind, acting as a biological computer. Has a lot of biological munchkining and pretty smart antagonists. Writing feels a bit lifeless sometimes though. 

  * [Addergoole](https://web.archive.org/web/20200217203909/http://www.addergoole.com/): Basically magic school with some cool bdsm and lgbt stuff. Written pretty well but wasn't my thing, but I can see why people would love it. 

  So yeah, give me your obscure good and subversive webnovels from the Wild West period of the internet.

    If you liked Symbiote, you should try Set In Stone, it's by the same writer but much better written. It's a story about a colony with a benevolent AI enforcing a kind of utopia. The writer was going to edit it and publish it in a book but has since disappeared.

  any good new stuff on royal road? i recently read [double-blind](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/50553/double-blind-a-modern-litrpg) and thought it was okay, even if it’s still pretty early in the story so no real conflict has developed.
  ```

  - u/lsparrish:
    ```
    I enjoyed that one. Morally grey protagonist (has ASPD but tries to have a moral code, much of the conflict is between the ruthlessness that gets him ahead vs the decent person he's trying to be). If you also like more empathic protagonists, Dungeon Man Sam is pretty good. Technomagica is somewhere in between (guilty ex-soviet scientist protagonist, very ruthless at times), and has more of a rationalist focus (plus some IMO rather stunning artwork).

    ```
    A Daring Synthesis on Spacebattles is the best Gamer fic I've ever read, despite being set in Worm and following Greg. Its ending was so bad I don't even have a funny analogy for it.
    ```

    - u/CaramilkThief:
      ```
      The ending is the author being a troll and owning his reader base. But to be honest, you don't have to read the actual ending. Like a few chapters before the end of the story there's a really satisfying stopping point that resolves all of the plot points it needs to. 

      It's some of the best character development I've ever seen in fanfiction. Highly recommend, even if you want to cringe into nothingness in the first few chapters.
      ```

      - u/fljared:
        ```
        I did like the story up to that point; Though the ending looks to me more like when an author gets bored and abandons a story, only this on has the author realize this and add a cap at the end. 

        Do you happen to know what the, so to speak, thing the author was aiming at with the troll ending? Was there some large group of commenters that wanted him to end with a harem or something?
        ```

        - u/CaramilkThief:
          ```
          From what I remember, the troll ending came from one of the author's discussions with another fanfiction author on some power mechanics that Wildbow once mentioned (>!something about how infinite copying of people and powers using echidna's shard would eventually lead to scion losing power!<) and he just saw an opportunity to include that interaction. It was sort of unprovoked? I don't really remember. You'd have to go back to the last chapter on spacebattles and look at the author's comment.
          ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      How is it a bad? Sure, it's a bit of a messy Gainax Ending, but it fits perfectly with the themes and the tone of the story, and it's not even that bitter or tragic---the whole character arc is completed, Greg has found true friendship and defeated (and accepted) his inner demons, and it's implied that everything works out... fine-ish in the long run >!minus Brockton Bay turning into a second Ellisburg and Greg having all his worst and darkest secrets revealed in a cringe rap diss track for the world to hear. But that's hysterically funny and fitting for the story, and honestly, the world does end up saved in the end and Greg has found enough confidence, wisdom, and friendship to cope with that, so it's not that bad.!<

  I stumbled across [Accidentally a Shrine Priestess](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/51842/accidentally-a-shrine-priestess) the other day; it's a nice, slice-of-life Isekai story in which a drunk office worker stumbles through a portal into a world with levels and shrine spirits, only to discover that bills are a universal constant. Seems like it'll eventually grow into one of those "running a small business in a fantasy world" stories, which are nice and cozy.

   It's still early days, and the story is slow paced, but I'm enjoying it so far.

  I just caught up to [A Practical Guide to Sorcery](https://www.azaleaellis.com/a-practical-guide-to-sorcery-series) so I need more recommendations for a story with magical university setting that actually focuses on the university part. Where characters actually attend classes, study magic and the whole Magic A is Magic A ordeal. Preferably with some cool teachers like Quirrell from HPMOR or Xvim from MoL.
  ```

  - u/tomtan:
    ```
    [Mark of the fool](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/41618/mark-of-the-fool-a-progression-fantasy) fits that, it takes a few chapters until they get to the university (around chapter 25) and the university is not the sole focus but it's a major focus of the story and there's a great teacher.

    Another option, that's rational adjacent (I'd say the hero is sometimes hot headed and an idiot but he never holds the idiot ball for no reason) is The Name of the Wind.
    ```

      Rat-adj. It's got nothing to do with PGTE just fyi.

      EDIT: Thought I should give more info. Besides the magic school stuff I mentioned, I like the humor of the story. It is extremely similar to that of Young Woman's Political Record where the humor comes from incredible discrapancy of viewpoints between the MC and other characters.

  Hello, everyone. 

  I am looking for stories that have accurate portrayals of psychological phenomena like: confirmation bias, cognitive dissonance, personal- and mass-delusions

  I am looking for writers who:

  * have a good understanding of human psychology — detailed and accurate understanding of things like confirmation bias, cognitive dissonance, personal- and mass-delusions (relevant to 'average' people instead of outliers with diagnosed disorders, and relevant to everyday scenarios), and maybe also mass hysteria.
   * the author's / narrative's understanding of these subjects shouldn't be within the framework of psychoanalysis or any other outdated or pseudoscientific disciplines.
  * are able to transfer this understanding into their story- and plot design, character actions and interactions, dialogue, characters' internal thought process, etc. These themes shouldn't be touched in the story just in a few passing paragraphs, but should be featured heavily enough to be relevant to this request.
   * Mass-delusions (in the context of this question) can be understood in relation to effects of mass propaganda, mass psychology of totalitarian regimes or cults, deprogramming of people who were affected by them, etc.

  Preferably, I am looking for fantasy or sci-fi stories, but if you know a good match that has some other genre (as long as it's fictional), please give the recommendation still. I'm not looking for stories which have literal NPCs (e.g. Westworld-like settings, LitRPGs, etc), as well as stories by Stephen King (already aware of his works being at least a partial match), or Alexander Wales, or Orwell / Zamyatin.

  *(A recently made similar recommendation yielded so far these two results: [*The Black Prism*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7165300-the-black-prism) in the Lightbringer Series and [*Too Like the Lightning*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26114545-too-like-the-lightning) in the Terra Ignota series.)*

    > the author's / narrative's understanding of these subjects shouldn't be within the framework of psychoanalysis or any other outdated or pseudoscientific disciplines.

    What discipline of psychotherapy is, in your opinion, up to date?

    Anyway, I have a recommendation that doesn't fit your request in any way other than the "human psychology" and "cognitive dissonance" parts. But it's just so good and I haven't seen it mentioned in a long time. [Demonology and the Tri-Phasic Model of Trauma: An Integrative Approach](https://archiveofourown.org/works/20177950/chapters/47807593).

    Also, Wildbow's works like to look at characters psychology. Twig was quite good.

    ```
    There's [R. Scott Bakker](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/8587.R_Scott_Bakker), a philosophy PhD and an exceedingly smart cookie. All his novels are about smart people thinking things through, and he's pretty good about portraying their inner mind. Don't mind the low ratings, his stuff tends to be a bit too unapologetically highbrow and grimdark for the general audience imo. 

    His main series [Prince of Nothing](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/301538.The_Darkness_That_Comes_Before) is the one that I would recommend most strongly. The story is about Kellhus, the result of a thousand year breeding experiment for intelligence, who gets sent back into civilization to kill his father, an exile from his people. It's epic and brutal as fuck. 

    [Neuropath](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/3170310) by him is probably the one that matches your request the best. It's a psychological thriller about a psychologist trying to help track down a serial killer who's a neurologist. The book is kind of a thought experiment about how consciousness works.
    ```

    - u/N0_B1g_De4l:
      ```
      > his stuff tends to be a bit too unapologetically highbrow and grimdark for the general audience imo

      To be fair, it is *very* grimdark. I've read 40k novels that have a less depressing outlook on the world, and I don't think I've read anything that is as willing to depict sexual violence. That said, the books are quite intellectually compelling, and I recommend them highly if you can tolerate the rape. I do think *Prince of Nothing* was better than *Neuropath*, as the latter felt more like I was being bludgeoned by his philosophy, while the former worked it in to the narrative in a way that felt more organic.

      *Prince of Nothing* is also by far the most anti-theistic thing I have ever read. And it's not the typical "religion flies you into buildings" thing, but a frank analysis of how taking religious texts at their word implies a world that is abjectly horrifying to a degree that is almost unimaginable.
      ```

    - u/CaramilkThief:
      ```
      The reason his works get low ratings is because the female characters never gain agency, and sexual violence (against all genders) is common. Now, that is a valid dealbreaker for some people, and other people will be able to look past it.
      ```

      - u/ivory12:
        ```
        Esmenet has some agency but she is also in many ways Bakker's idea of what the whore-Madonna complex would look like as a character and less a fully realized person.

        My opinion is Prince of Nothing is great. It definitely is not for some people but that's a question any prospective reader probably has to answer for themselves. It deserves a shot.
        ```

  - u/EdenicFaithful:
    ```
    You may have read it already, and it doesn't fit the "mass-delusion" theme (though there's some parts about cultish behaviour and leaders), but you might like [Pokemon: The Origin of Species](http://daystareld.com/pokemon/). From the author:

    >To that end, much of the science mentioned in my story, especially the psychology, is based on real research and experimental results. While I could no more rationally explain how a pokeball would "actually" work than I could build one, my aim is to, at the very least, present a version of the pokemon world that is logically consistent with itself, which includes not just a realistic examination of pokemon/human interactions and an attempt to address some of the contradictory parts of the pokemon universe, but also an exploration of how society thrives in a world where deadly monsters are commonplace, and children are trained from a young age to survive independently by their pre-teens.
    ```

  - u/MoneyLicense:
    ```
    Tentatively I recommend [Twig](https://twigserial.wordpress.com). From memory, it does a good job of "Psychoanalysis as a Superpower", while being believable given the setting/conceit. I think it explored a lot of the topics you mentioned.

    Can someone else confirm how realistic the psychological maneuvering was?
    ```

  - u/Judah77:
    ```
    Well I have one rec, volume one of Mind Games -- https://www.amazon.com/Mind-Games-Disillusionists-Trilogy-Book/dp/0553592610

    The MC is a hypochondriac and it's an urban fantasy with paranormal powers.  I really enjoyed the psychological aspects of this particular novel since the 'powers' are based around the psyche, though I don't know how 'realistic' they were.  Your criteria about 'themes' do get met as the novel focuses on psychology as the paranormal segue.  Please note, do not read the sequel.  The author was not up to the same standards so just stick with book one and leave it at that if you are interested.  It was supposed to be a trilogy but after book 2 flopped book 3 never happened.

      Follow up review after reading: cool setting and plot... if you don't mind skimming through it. Unless you like reading wiki articles about a setting's world-building, constant interaction between characters about irrelevant things and very slow progress for the word count.

      Its a shame because the actual direction the plot is going is awesome! If the author reads this my advice is to get the ball rolling! The intro being 10 years after the transfer is super great, but keep up that pace!

      Is "fairy godmother" a Xianxia trope term or is she literally acting like a fairy godmother from western media?
      ```

      - u/Zysek:
        ```
        The correct Xianxia trope is Ghost Grandpa, which I think mostly originates from one of the first successful Xianxias: Coiling Dragon. (Though it's probably inspired by something in more classic genre novels such as Legend of the Condor Heroes).  


        The trope involves a very old and experienced cultivator surviving as a host or imprint on some kind of object the MC (main character) finds. They usually help out the MC at the start - sometimes with good intentions and sometimes just to prepare a good vessel for them to posess and revive.  


        As you can imagine, this being Xianxia, this *never* works out for the evil Ghost Grandpa.
        ```

        - u/jaghataikhan:
          ```
          Basically a Horcrux imprint of Voldemort as an evil mentor to Harry Potter lol?
          ```

          - u/CreationBlues:
            ```
            Pretty much.

            However, I don't think that Taylor matches the ghost grandpa trope because it's very specific. Having the ghost grandpa in charge of 99% of the cultivation isn't a part of the trope due to how important self determination and sufficiency is in the genre. Instead, Taylor is a cheat, called a golden finger. Golden fingers can be items, skills, unique abilities or whatever. A super manual, reincarnation, a gourd that refines ultra pure power sources, an invincible sword, a golden finger is what sets the MC up for greatness. Taylor isn't teaching xifeng to solve problems or guiding her through conflict, she *just taylors through it* and solves their problems for them.
            ```

      - u/kraryal:
        ```
        Taylor is helping out a young girl as an older mentor/supernatural figure. At various points the girl thinks of her as her actual mother. 
        It's not directly Cinderella style wish granting but it's functionally similar.
        ```

      - u/SpeakKindly:
        ```
        I got the description "fairy godmother" from the author's words right before the first chapter. It is a metaphor, but a purely western one.

        Well you're in luck because there's about ten books in the series and they're all on Kindle Unlimited; also, the first three books (starting with [Unsouled](https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B01H1CYBS6)) might still be just plain free at the moment (I can't really tell, Amazon is bad at giving you the price for ebooks you already own).

        If you don't want to read them, it's basically a setting where aura floats around and you can pull it into yourself, turning it into madra. The actual mix of energies (e.g, shadows and dreams, fire and destruction, blood and sharpness) and how you circulate them through your body gives you the ability to use certain powers. 

        Taylor gets isekaied into the middle of a large clan of humans who use shadow and dream madra, which works _super well_ with her QA granted multitasking ability.

    If you like Youjo Senki, the authors for *A Young Woman's Marvelous Adventure* (Youjo Senki/MCU) and *A Young Woman's New Life as an Imperial Princess* (Youjo Senki/Gate Jietai Crossover) have started writing again. Both are fun to read, no idea on how long either will last though.

    Sure. Most of my favs are OreGairu crossovers, and I don't think any of them could be called new, but they are all good. 

    **[My Trans-Dimensional, Overpowered Protagonist, Harem Comedy is Wrong, as Expected](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/my-trans-dimensional-overpowered-protagonist-harem-comedy-is-wrong-as-expected-oregairu-danmachi-complete.367903/)**. Easily my favorite on the list. It takes the protagonist, the narrative style, and the thematic goals of OreGairu, along with the setting, characters, and plot beats of DanMachi, and melds them together beautifully. I've been rereading it and it's been very enjoyable. 

    **[My Hero School Adventure is All Wrong, As Expected](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/my-hero-school-adventure-is-all-wrong-as-expected-bnha-x-oregairu.697066/)**. Another OreGairu crossover, taking most of the cast and inserting them into the MHA plot and setting. Very very solid.

    **[The Splendid Spider-Man](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-splendid-spider-man-oregairu-x-spider-man-cameos-from-rainbow-six-siege-steins-gate-and-more.915856/)**. The final Hachiman fic, he becomes Spider-Man in this one. This one doesn't get the attention it deserves, and is in hibernation, but I'd still call it worth reading.

    **[A Soldier Adrift: Captain Westeros](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-soldier-adrift-captain-westeros-asoiaf-captain-america-quest-story-only-thread.978792/)**. Steve Rogers is flung to the ASOIAF setting in the aftermath of the final battle in Endgame. Core appeal to this is that he is a good man of unmatched power and skill moving through Westeros, leaving ripples in the political landscape and gathering a small cast of characters to form his fledgeling house.

    The worst thing about this fic is how infrequently the author updates it 🥲

    Its very fun, +1 from me. Raven seems to play a little fast and loose with the range of Taylor's ability, but if you can ignore that its great.

    [Son of the Mannis](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/son-of-man-nis-an-asoiaf-si.57501/#post-13007033) has some uplift but its been years since I read it and it is a dead fic.

      I just finished this, and at best I'd give it a *very* cautious recommend if you're bored and have a few hours to kill and want to read an alt-timeline for ASOIAF.

      The story did draw me in and make me want to see how it ended, but there are some serious problems in the writing, not to mention the huge amounts of plot armour Tyrion gets. It's very clearly a "Tyrion is awesome, so we'll make him awesome!" fanfic, but that was pretty obvious from the get-go.

    Have you read [Purple Days](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/purple-days-asoiaf-joffrey-timeloop-au.450894/)? It's not a SI, but I have to recommend it anytime someone asks for a game of thrones fic since it's so good. There's a bunch of kingdom building type stuff in the second half of the story.
