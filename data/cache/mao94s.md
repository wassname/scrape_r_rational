## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  I'm looking for what one might term "comedy of successes" stories (so named by Ephemeral), about plans that go *too well*, or people who repeatedly succeed not on purpose, or people who have to rapidly capitalize on doing better than they expected.  The most famous case is probably *The Warrior's Apprentice* but other cases that come to mind for me:

  * *My Next Life As A Villainess* (no link cuz Mangadex down)
  * *To Be An Eminence In The Shadows* (no link cuz Mangadex down)
  * many Discworld books and *Good Omens*
  * *The Warrior's Apprentice* and several other Miles Vorkosigan books
  * the recent Chapter 86 of the NSFW+ (PRV 30) work [Man And Monster](https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/man-and-monster.13725/) which is where this whole conversation started

  Any other recommendations in this trope?

    [Yōjo Senki](https://myanimelist.net/manga/88930/Youjo_Senki) is a light novel series (adapted into a manga and anime) that would fit your request.

    The story follows a Japanese salaryman who gets isekaid into the body of an orphan girl (Tanya) in magical alternate universe Germany right as World War I is heating up. Tanya gets drafted into the war due to her exceptional magical prowess. The running gag is that she keeps making convoluted schemes to fail in a way that will get her redeployed away from the front lines, but she always succeeds by accident and winds up looking like a hero (or bloodthirsty warhawk).

    There are also several excellent fanfics of the series that uphold the same spirit. My favorite is [A Young Woman's Political Record](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-young-womans-political-record-youjo-senki-saga-of-tanya-the-evil.660569/reader/). It begins post-war with Tanya accepting a "cushy job" as spokesperson for the 'Germanian Workers' Party'. She makes radical, divisive campaign promises that she never plans to keep because she assumes the party is too fringe too ever win political power. Needless to say, things don't go to plan.

      - u/nytelios:

        I found YWPR more satisfying for an alt history craving as it's an immaculate political comedy for two thirds of the complete story. YGDR is more of an episodic cat and mouse with Tanya's rogue adventurism being the main selling point. They scratch different itches but feel like two sides of a coin - law vs outlaw, politics vs economics, ENTJ vs ISTP.

    *Ciaphas Cain*, Hero of the Imperium! does a lot of this. Think Rincewind in Warhammer 40K. These are all novels.

    "Which brings us to Cain’s bizarre luck. Because Cain is simultaneously incredibly lucky and incredibly unlucky. He routinely survives things he has no right surviving, but is also constantly being roped into terrifying and dangerous situations despite his best efforts to avoid them."

    [Losing Money to be a Tycoon](https://www.novelupdates.com/series/losing-money-to-be-a-tycoon/)

    The MC has been sent back in time, and given a system that gives him a fund to do business with. If he loses money at that business, it converts the lost money into personal funds at a ratio of 1:100 or something. If he makes money in the business, he gets personal funds of 1:1. So of course, he gets somewhat obsessive about trying to lose money. He finds this extraordinarily difficult, especially because he can't let anyone know that's what he's trying to do. Other people think he's a philanthropist that's trying to change the way the world works through example, and some mind-chess master who always finds a way to pull big wins from the seeming jaws of defeat, but he's just trying to make himself some cash. 

    It's a LN, and while not particularly well-written, I find the premise enjoyable enough and the execution hilarious enough that I've read over a thousand chapters.

    Taylor has no power. Everyone thinks she has a power, otherwise how does she keep doing this stuff? It's by accident and coincidence, she insists. No one believes her.   


    I enjoy this trope, and there's even some of it in my own story, [A Practical Guide to Sorcery](https://www.azaleaellis.com/read-pgts/) (no relation to PGTEvil). My MC's reputation gets **wildly** blown out of proportion by the law enforcement who are trying to capture her but keep failing, as they put together disparate clues about her actions in the completely wrong way. And thus, a first-term magic student is a "flee on sight" wanted criminal who taunts them with their lack of capability.

  I saw [Ar'Kendrithyst](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26727/arkendrithyst) mentioned a few times in passing over the last few threads, but I also saw more than once that it was considered a "controversial recommendation." I'm wondering if someone would elaborate? I'm about halfway through the available chapters and I'm really enjoying it, primarily for the exploration of the setting's magic system, but also because I enjoy looking for Chekhov's Guns and then imagining how the protagonist will deal with them. My only complaints so far would be that the protagonist is a bit Marty Stu-ish, and that everyone "softly smiles" at everything. Is it because it is only rational-adjacent? Or is there some other controversy I am missing?

  Similar question for [With This Ring](https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-thread-fourteen.8938/), though to be fair I stopped reading that almost two years ago once I had caught up. My memory is a bit hazy but I remember reading it was controversial. Any explanation as to why?

  For recommendations, I mentioned it last week but [OCTO](https://zalbert.net/octo/) by /u/zenoalbertbell was a fantastic surprise read. The beginning is a bit slow, but you kinda see where it's going, and then the perspective shifts and HOLY MOLEY it gets scary, and amazing. I was left craving more, but also felt it ended at a great place. 

  Older recommendation, but I really enjoyed some RWBY fan fiction by [Coeur Al'Aran](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/6272865/Coeur-Al-Aran) awhile back. Probably my favorite was [Forged Destiny](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12044591/1/Forged-Destiny), which is a fan fiction where the world of Remnant is game-ified, so a bit more of a litRPG genre. Follows a Jaune who is born into the Blacksmith class, but enters Beacon disguised as a Knight class. Good class/RPG system, and good shipping. You don't need to know RWBY background to enjoy it, but I got more out of it by having watched about 3 or 4 seasons worth of it. Again, not especially rational - but good world building and exploration of an RPG world system. 

  Current ones I keep up with include [Beware of Chicken](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/39408/beware-of-chicken) (popcorny fluff, but an entertaining trope exploration of the xanxia/cultivation genre), [Practical Guide to Evil](https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/) (we all know it, I hope!), and [Metaworld Chronicles](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/14167/metaworld-chronicles) (which I enjoy for the unique alt-world view, with China/Australia as the focus, though the recent arc is in England... great for economic and political intrigue, but it takes a loooooong time to get there. Also a blatant Mary Sue protagonist).

    > Similar question for With This Ring, though to be fair I stopped reading that almost two years ago once I had caught up. My memory is a bit hazy but I remember reading it was controversial. Any explanation as to why?

    There were a couple things.

    The author MrZoat got into a snit with the moderators over on SB (regarding spoilers or something with Star Wars), and moved to SV (sufficient velocity).

    Then he got into a snit with the moderators there, about some controversial comments regarding trans people, without getting into the specifics. Zoat then moved to QQ (questionable questing).

    I haven't really been following it since the move to QQ.  It didn't seem that interesting at that point, the MC is the super-powerful, and has founded his own Orange Lantern Corps.  The last I read, some of the real troublemakers in the DC pantheon like Darkseid had not been addressed yet (either by the SI or by Grayven), but in general things were going very well.

    I might pick it up again, maybe.  Some arcs, like "Stars, Crossed..." were completely epic, and I super enjoyed them, but it peaked (for me at least) there.
    ```

    - u/chiruochiba:
      ```
      As an addendum to your summary of the MrZoat drama:

      [This thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/akek1j/rstff_whats_going_on_with_mr_zoat_with_this_ring/) from two years ago explains the situation fairly well and is a decent microcosm of people debating on both sides of the issue.
      ```

    - u/DangerouslyUnstable:
      ```
      I'm still reading it, but it's sort of just "eh" at this point. The story no longer has any goal or anything (as far as I can tell at least). It's probably a relatively "real" depiction of a superhero (as much as that makes sense) in that they just go along, dealing with crises as they crop up, and (for the good ones) trying to make a difference when there _aren't_ any crises.

      Unfortunately, as a story, that doesn't work very well and leads to meandering and lack of focus. Also, the increasing prevalence of interludes from alternate universe versions (not just Grayven, in fact, usually not), signals to me that the author is also sort of getting bored with the main (or main 2) plots. If it wasn't for the fact that it publishes every day and the prose was better than average, I would probably drop it. As it is, I usually don't have enough things to read, and it's not actively bad, so I'm keeping up with it. But it has absolutely lost most of the magic it had in the beginning.
      ```

      - u/ansible:
        ```
        > Also, the increasing prevalence of interludes from alternate universe versions (not just Grayven, in fact, usually not),

        Ugh.  I did finally warm up to Grayven with the "Stars, Crossed..." arc, but I typically skipped the alternates, even some of the Grayven ones, before and after that arc.
        ```

        - u/ansible:
          ```
          And... now I'm reading that arc again.  So many good exchanges. Alternate Batman talking to Grayven:

          > "You've been brought to an alternate dimension. We need your help."
          >
          > "I.. don't think that's the right use of the word 'dimension'…"
          >
          > "Did you design and build a portal capable of traveling between them?"
          >
          > Um? "No?"
          >
          > "Then we'll use my terminology."
          ```

          - u/ansible:
            ```
            And another one, in case anyone comes across this thread.

            Grayven is talking to Scott Free, and trying to convince his "brother" to join him on conquering the Earth.  Scott isn't keen on this though:

            > Scott:  "-but I'm not helping you take over. Just because they (the people of Earth) have made bad choices a few times doesn't mean they can't learn to make better ones."
            >
            > Grayven: "There's something you didn't learn in the X-Pit." He frowns. "No, really, I admire the way you overcame their attempts to condition you. Always have. Heck, you're the guy who inspired me to break free. Both of you have my respect."
            >
            > Scott: "Huh. I hadn't realised-."
            >
            > Grayven: "And once I take over, I'm going to avoid killing you and Barda if at all possible."
            >
            > Scott: "Uh. Thanks."

            Grayven doesn't *actually* intend to take over (well, kinda, but not really, but kinda), but he is really hamming it up here as the "supervillian".

            And later, talking to John Stewart about the President of the USA (who has been replaced by a robot):

            > "It would probably be easier to leave it to Scott once we've overthrown the President and killed Father Time."
            >
            > "Horne was the one who got elected. The robot's just a fake."
            >
            > "No. No. Do not take this away from me. I'm the only person on the team who hasn't overthrown a president yet. I'm feeling left out!"
            >
            > He shakes his head in irritation, but there's a small smile on his face.
            ```

  - u/SvalbardCaretaker:
    ```
    TLDR: Basically everything PastafarianGames said. The ratio of Stuff I liked to filler stuff was too low. 


    Its basically magical exploration porn but with a magic system the author pulls out of their fingers at will. If I want to read about new interesting magic systems  I pull out a pen&paper source book. 

    Slice of life can be fine, but the prose doesn't carry "nothing happens" chapters. 

    Things I liked: 

    - The concept of the System and that time Erik does The Thing for the first time, the Registrars ("I will help you to the best of my ability planning your build, wether you want to farm or plan to overthrow the gods!"),  that the world is actually functional and not an isekai shithole (special Child protection from the System, anyone?) , that the System is actually complex enough to allow individualisation, relatively unique species (Orcol+Wrought), the ferocity with which Al (the sewermaster) defends his mana-regen build. 

    - Other dislikes:  mildly mediocre writing, its readable enough but also forgetable? You can skip 5 chapters and will not have missed anything interesting happening. The rather unfocussed way Erik does magical research - I *think* the first time he thinks about life extension magic is somewhere around chapter 80? And then its one chapter and dropped again. Not really up to rat!fic standards, so you hit the mark there.  Bit later the grimdark torture porn is too much for me. Erik is also mildly hard to emphasize with, I remember like three scenes were I genuinely felt emotion from him, otherwise its just "Erik did this and
     that and that".   


    Compare to [Sins of Cinnamon](https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/the-sins-of-cinnamon.7774/reader). Warnings: NSFW (sex) and **unfinished** and probably **abandonded**. 150k words of great litRPG with very high quality writing+constantly awesome worldbuilding drops and applied rationality, we get reasons for stuff and hints and story progression,  with incredibly emotionally engaging characters. The unfinishdness doesn't even matter.

  - u/sohois:
    ```
    I feel like currently Ar'Kendrithyst is one of the best web novels around, but that's 130+ chapters in. The first 50 chapters are a real slog, however, and as mentioned Erik tends to just get handed power on a silver platter without much work. In general it's a slightly awkward mix of slice of life with "chosen one" isekai as well, spending a lot of time on the day-today of Erik but without anything like the skill of, for example, The Wandering Inn.

    I think those are some of the biggest flaws.

      ```

  - u/PastafarianGames:
    ```
    My main hypothesis for why A'K is controversial (and I'm one of the people who describe it as such, and also one of the people who love it) is this:

    There are people who want a power fantasy murderhobo, and Erik is too slice-of-life and too introspective to satisfy these people. (I call them the Azarinth Healer contingent.) Then, there are people who want a struggle for survival, and Erik acquires incredible power too quickly to satisfy these people. (I call them the Delve contingent.) Third, there are the folks who want a story about, effectively, kingdom building, and the overall storyline around Spur disappoints them (I call this the Connecticut Yankee contingent). Finally, there are the people who want a real slice-of-life story with Erik inventing new kinds of tubers, and Erik does too much fighting and monster-genociding for those people. (I call this the No Epic Loot Only Puns contingent.)

    He's either too much of a murderhobo or too little of one, there's either too much slice-of-life or too little, he's too Marty Stu or he doesn't find enough positive recognition, there's too much focus on the polity-level stuff but also those plot arcs wrap up in an unsatisfying way... there are just a lot of dynamics where someone who's a fan of A'K or of portal fantasy / isekai for one reason or another might find it to be disappointing.
    ```

    - u/Judah77:
      ```
      I'm not any of those things and I find it disappointing because the MC Erik has an extremely weak, indecisive, non-rational character.  If group A wants something, they can convince MC to do it.  If group B which hates group A wants something else, they can convince MC to do it.  This brings up situations where the MC who got too much power is effectively in a political tug of war between groups A,B,C,D, and E because he can't say no.  Instead of manning up, instead MC goes running to a big power and hides behind their influence.  It's like he's a little kid with big magic and no one ever spanks him for being indecisive.  I dropped around CH 80 btw.
      ```

    - u/CaramilkThief:
      ```
      I'll also say that Erick is explicitly irrational, and that probably rubs a lot of people wrong over here. He's indecisive, gullible, easily swayed by other people's opinions, and sometimes does things other people tell him are wrong! ( >!like that time when Jane told him not to give away the knowledge for particle magic and look what happened !<) These are obvious big nono's for r/rational recommendations. I personally love it, because I love how Erick slowly learns to lean into his power and actually speak up, as well as the moral flip flops he does in search of a moral stance that isn't debilitating in a death world.
      ```

    - u/Do_Not_Go_In_There:
      ```
      I call reviews like this the Fanboy review: the critics are wrong, the story is great.

      Ironically, you present a good argument for the problems of the story: Reading between the lines, you make it sound like the writing is just really inconsistent - The MC is too much of one thing or another, even if both are opposing qualities. If two groups who dislike opposing things both dislike the story (like you say) it means that either everyone is wrong, or the story has elements that both dislike. It sound like either the MC just doesn't have a set of beliefs/morals and goes along with whatever the people around him are doing. That he's essentially a stand-in for whatever the author needs at a particular point in the story.
      ```

    - u/TridentTine:
      ```
      It's an interesting hypothesis. Personally I just found the concept uninteresting to start, then the characters and writing in the first few chapters did nothing to encourage me to read further, so I didn't.
      ```

    - u/Dragfie:
      ```
      Well, one data-point here against that. I don't fit in any of those categories.

      I just couldn't get past the dialogue between the father and daughter; made me cringe so hard I couldn't keep going.

        ```

  - u/Yosarian2:
    ```
    One thing that bugs me about Ar'Kendrithyst as a story is he spends so much time playing with the magic system that he ends up never using 90% of the spells he learns or invents. It's not often that he pulls out one of them and uses it in a crisis either; it's more like he'll spend a whole chapter making magic, create 25 different spells, one of which is overpowered, and then only use the one overpowered one from that point on and the rest may never come up again.  That really slows down the story without any real payoff.

    I do really enjoy the story, though, it's otherwise good.

      ```
      It's not too bad, though the protagonist is still a Mary Sue (though she does get a slight power down by >!losing her draconic essence!<, not that it slows her down much at all). I like that there is more exploration of demi-human species like elves and dwarves. The dwarves especially are probably what I enjoy most about the arc. The main story arc is slowly unfolding, but the arc so far definitely feels like more side quest content. Entertaining side quests, but not ultimately directly tying into Gwen's quest to track down her master's killer.

      Yes, over the course of the story. He's very much his own worst enemy for a good portion of it though, constantly sticking his foot in his own mouth. I wouldn't say he's guilty of holding an idiot ball when it comes to social cues, but it takes him a long time to learn to think before he speaks. 

      The in-novel reason for this is because his Charisma is abysmal, when it's supposed to be a Knight's best stat. But if it's frustrating you already, be warned it remains an issue for most of the story (though he does get better over time).

  Not your regular recommendation comment, but I found two neat things this week that may be of interest to some people.

  [Hanakana](https://github.com/mountbuild/hanakana) alphabet:
  > Hanákana is a Universal Writing System (UWS), capable of representing all human voice sounds in a concise and readable script. This means you can write any language in Hanákana script and read it without having to learn that language's specific quirks. Hanákana is a sound-based script, which means when you read see a symbol/letter, you know exactly how it is pronounced.

  [Cistercian Monk numbering system](https://www.dcode.fr/cistercian-numbers) (and the [Numberphile video](https://youtu.be/9p55Qgt7Ciw) on it)

  If I do anything creative, I'll try to use both of these in any imagery because I find them both neat.
  ```

  - u/SpeakKindly:
    ```
    After admittedly only a quick look, I'm skeptical of Hanákana. They claim that it's a sound-based script, but they also have a rule-based transformation from pinyin. So for instance 七 (qī) becomes "txhi^" and 吃 (chī) becomes "t+xhi^". Different consonant, same vowel. But pinyin is trash and the same letter "i" means different things situationally; in IPA those same two characters are "tɕʰiː" and "ʈʂʰʐ̩ː". 

    Maybe the script is fine and they just didn't do research into how Chinese sounds work, but Chinese is actually far from my first choice of language to look at, it's just one of the only ones for which they go into any detail. My bet is that this is a script developed by some people that know English and Japanese and haven't given much thought to how other languages work.

    Which is nice in its own way! IPA started as a similar project by French speakers, and so the further you get from French sounds, the more it starts to resemble Zalgo text. Maybe in a hundred years, if this script is still around, it will be a compelling alternative to IPA which is better for some things and worse for others.

    Also, it's prettier than IPA.

    ```
    A magic system that requires no obstructions between yourself and the sky above. You could explain it as traditional magic stuff, or easily go into divinity and a deity looking over everyone. 

    Some proportion of people can use magic, but not all of them. Any mage has to work out the trade off between sleeping under cover versus risk of being ambushed one-sidedly with ranged fireballs and such. Scaling up to larger conflicts, dedicated fortifications have to have severe functional changes, since being able to leave from under cover is more important in a magical fight than having a stone barrier between you and the other guy. In a land with frequent bouts of horrible and/or dangerous weather (look at pictures some of the bad hailstones we get in Australia come winter, then amp that up more for the story), the decisions become harder, since hanging out in the worst weather would require a bunch of sustained defensive magic, leaving you vulnerable in a sudden conflict a different way than overhead cover nullification. No mage would ever be 100% safe when trying to sleep or rest, and that resulting paranoia would infect a lot of other decisions. Hiding is also dramatically more situational with the rules on cover preventing many options, and AoE magic being possible (or just something on fire and wait for it to spread to conserve your mage juice) can flush people out, leading to mages to either force duels with quick strikes, or focus on the ability to run away fast.

    Also, aesthetic preferences of buildings would change a lot due to the lower importance of them to the mage class, and the differences in how each group feel about a permanent residence would be a source of division.

    (Idea came from a Brandon Sanderson lecture where he remarked about having only half the whiteboard available because lighting issues and that he'd be unable to "write in the shadows." i thought some sort of magic invisible ink based on light levels would be cool as a minor thing in a story, then made it about natural light, then expanded the scope to a magic system, then changed it to being clear overhead to stop people using glass and mirrors to get around the downsides)
    ```

    - u/echemon:
      ```
      How is 'above' defined?  Relative to the ground?  If I'm at the bottom of a chimney pointing directly up, I can use magic.  What if I tilt the whole chimney slowly?  At what point can I no longer use magic?

      At higher altitudes, a wider range of angles above my head are pointing at the sky rather than the ground.  (If you're way out in space, every direction is sky except the lines of sight that intersect with planets and stars and gas molecules etc.)

      This obviously means there is or was a nation/group of wizards that decided to build a tower of babel, both for potentially higher usable power at the top (depending on whether the maximum chimney angle changes with altitude: if it does, people higher up in the tower can be inside and supplied with skyvision from chimneys at ever increasing angles, meaning people very high up in the tower (airplane heights) could use magic practically while looking out the window)  and also to try and reach the source of their power.  How high they get depends on the story and also whether there's magic that's able to reinforce/hold up buildings.  A pretty metal way of doing things would be if the tower had to actively be held up by mages at all times, necessitating a special order that works in shifts, maybe as drudgework punishment duty.

      More on the angle stuff:  if you were far enough away from the earth and moon that you couldn't do either, I'm assuming that you'd be able to cast spells no matter which direction you were pointing in.

      One possible way of doing things, I've just realized, is to work based on how occluded you are from the CMB (or this universe's magic equivalent).  So it's a matter of how of the sky is visible to you in all directions.  Than a mage in a valley is weaker than a mage on a flat plain, because the flat plain mage is visible to half the sky whereas the valley mage can only be seen from a smaller angle above.  All mages are operating at half-strength because the earth itself occludes half the sky.  If you want to get extra funky, make the power scaling exponential/non-linear; in a hypothetical universe with no matter at all, a mage would be infinitely powerful, but in practice you can only approach weakly godlike out in intergalactic space because tiny parts of the celestial sphere will always be occluded by stars, planets, dust clouds etc.

      So it's known that a mage standing on top of the World Tower (highest point in the world) is significantly stronger than on the ground (it's high enough that a percent less of the sky is taken up by planet) and that mages generally are strongest on nights of the new moon (no sun or moon to occlude parts of the sky) and on certain parts of the planet (whichever part points away from the milky way), hence why the tower is built at that point on the planet and controlled by an ancient order. 

      But the big bad has measured relative strengths, done the math, realized the implications, and is building a magitech rocket to go to space to become the strongest mage in history.  The hero finds this out and has to stop him, this ends with a fight where both are on accelerating orbital trajectories and rapidly gaining in power as they spiral away from the earth (they're both on the rocket when it launches, powerless as they're enclosed to keep the air in, and fight with what's at hand, finally tearing the rocket open/apart) but have to figure out how to stay alive in space, what with the vacuum and radiation belts, while having DBZ-level fights, with the villian finally throwing the moon at the hero, and then the hero defeating the villian by diguising his cloak with an illusion of the stars and wrapping it around him, which acts as just enough occlusion from the heavens to depower big bad long enough for the hero to strike him down and put the moon back in place.  Hero settles in as god, end.

    Good stuff. Here are some quick reviews for those of these that I've read and others might not've:

    * *The Last Angel*: Book one was a great read and thoroughly enjoyable. The premise, buildup, and climax were all fantastic, and it helps that this is one of my favorite niche genres (ancient-HFY-kickass-AI-avenger). Also, there's quite a lot of word count, which is great. If you're looking for original web-fiction scifi, you should definitely read this. I'll eventually get around to reading books two and three, but I didn't like how >!Red suffers a software glitch that sends her back into her memories and causes her to attack her allies. This just felt somewhat contrived and like a step backwards when one really wasn't necessary.!<

    * *Tower of Somnus*: Best way to describe this would be a cyberpunk-dystopia VR-litrpg where the characters gain the ability to use in-game powers outside of the game. I read almost to the end of book one, and overall, it was decent but my interest just lapsed after a while. Might pick it up again eventually. 

    * *The Devil's Foundry*: The premise has a lot of things I like: superheroes and villains forced to work together, civilization bootstrapping, portal fantasy, etc and it executes rather well too--it shows that Argentorium is an experienced author. The problem is though that right now it's incomplete and the update pace is really slow. There's only like three chapters a month and they're only like 2k words each and frequently end on cliffhangers. I'll revisit this when/if it finishes or reaches >100k words. 

    * *Quod Olim Erat*: Good stuff. I've written a review for this before, and I love AI protagonists in general. Also, it's complete and so is book two (and book three is being written currently). 

    * *The Gilded Hero*: A grittier, "realistic", take on portal fantasy, with more protagonist suffering. Wercwercwerc does good work, and I'm interested to see where this one goes.

    From that list, I started a few of the top-ranked ones but found I didn't get very far. I'm not sure if my tastes are just different than the hpfanfiction subreddit, or if I need to give the works a longer chance then I did.

    That said, the top rec, [Seventh Horcrux](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106), was fantastic from the get go. I think users here will enjoy. Blurb is:  


    >The presence of a  foreign soul may have unexpected side effects on a growing child. I am  Lord Volde...Harry Potter. I'm Harry Potter. In which Harry is insane,  Hermione is a Dark Lady-in-training, Ginny is a minion, and Ron is  confused.

    I also searched the sub for other fics that were HP-Universe-but-original story. I found the [Alexandra Quick](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3964606/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Thorn-Circle) series. So far I'm a book and a half in and it's alright, but nothing special. Good if you need a time-filler / are content starved.

    ```

    - u/forgottengiant:
      ```
      Mainly, more coverage of how the particular powers work and how they impact the lives of those who receive them. For example, the treatment of how the black pill works was clever, but extremely minimal. Supposedly, the black pill allows you to experiment with several approaches to the next month, by "resolving" to do one thing, using future-sight to see how that goes, and then "resolving" to do the next thing, etc until you're satisfied. But wouldn't this mean you break the resolution? Why, then, do you get to see what would happen if you hadn't broken the resolution?

      In other words, does the black pill allow you to see your own actual future, or does it allow you to see an alternate future? If the latter, where does the alternate future come from? What determines which future you see? How can you control it?

      There are different possible answers, many of them interesting, so I'd like that to be explored more.

      Similarly, other powers have some subtle questions about boundaries which could be interesting.

      A fanfic would, of course, have to come up with a satisfying alternate ending -- which would be quite a challenge.

It's basically a litrpg system that lets him use XP to advance his understanding of science, and that in turn lets him use that understanding to create technological discoveries and blueprints, up to and including a dyson sphere. 

  I'm still in the first few chapters so can't give a full recommendation, but it's very promising do far. And the translation isn't your typical xianxia tier trash, so that's a nice change. 

  The first 40 chapter are available hassle free at the link above, but after that webnovel.com starts fucking with you. I recommend you Google something like 'title name + epub download'.

    I'm skeptical but any story with "Chapter 8: The Optimal Inversion Theory of Linear Operators and Linear Functions" will at least get an attempted read from me.  A bit sad that it doesn't seem to try to teach anything, but maybe the author's intelligence will rub onto it somewhere.

      Meh. Although it's clear the author does know what he's talking about to some extent, there's still zero "showing." Like, the narration will make a passing reference to real ideas - and they're usually near enough to the appropriate ideas, which is more than most fiction can say - but then continue to tell you what has occurred rather than showing you anything interesting.

      What rubs me the wrong way is how it fetishizes "studying," and makes very little reference to the fact that what is described in the book is largely ineffective and counterproductive. This can somewhat be excused for the MC, since he has a magic system making everything work, but rather than emphasising the contrast between the "magicness" of the system and actually effective learning, everyone else does the same types of behaviour.

      It's like wish-fulfilment if your weirdly specific wish is that cramming textbooks was actually an effective method of developing real expertise.

          Mediocre litrpg actually. Above-average litrpg usually stressing "go outside the system", "the system is only crutch" or "you will not reach greatness by relying on the system".  They are about "pondering the dao" or exploring outside of the system reach or non-system skills etc.

It says something about the degree to which I'm desperate for anything remotely resembling a mathematician protagonist who doesn't just run off and fight aliens instead, that I'm still reading, while frequently reminding my brain that everything I'm reading is false.

        [This BNHA fic](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-heroic-chronicles-of-a-young-man-youjo-senki-my-hero-academia.875316/) does a reasonable job of that, it got recommended in either last weeks thread or the week before. Main character is basically the protagonist of Youjo Senki pre-Isekai (except a student enrolled in UA), the unnamed salaryman, who generally takes the "cold and clinical smart guy" trope to heart while being both purely focused on getting a stable and comfortable life for himself without letting others know how selfish his goals, and thus presenting himself as an upstanding member of society (a society that values heroism highly). His quirk is basically being able to affect the world by expending calories, expressed to himself through math. The result is he's got a large toolbox of options at hand, a limited set of resources, and the ability to do a weaker version of what many other quirks could do, but potentially several effects simultaneously.

        You could argue against how math-y the superpower is (and all superpowers), but a protagonist who needed to actually gain some understanding of math to use his power, and who eventually works out a way to make an actual measuring system for how much power he can use and how much each ability/option consumes and at what rate, instead of going off of gut feeling like he had been earlier (and like pretty much every other character does in canon), is still head and shoulders over "beating the villain through the power of friendship" and other similar Shonen tropes.

    > Find positive numbers a and b. Equation: (X→0) lim 1/(x-bsin(x)) ∫2/√(a+2t) dt =1 (integral limits are x and 0)

    What the fuck is up with that problem statement? 
    Which is the lower limit? which is the upper limit? 
    Why does the story-stated [solution not work](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/pqtmebjo6m)?

    That got me mad enough to look at the raws

    > 试求正数a与b，使等式（X→0）lim1/（x-bsinx）∫t2/√（a+t2）dt=1成立。（∫上角标为x，下角标为0）

    and wow the translators just completely messed up transcribing the integral. (those look like "t squared"s and integral from 0 to x)

    Then there's the "explanation". Was the author trying for maximum confusion? 

    >While writing he began to explain, “Typical 0/0 undefined equation. Just use L’Hopital’s rule. The first step is to separate the integral. That’s easy, right? From (X –> 0) lim (1-bcosx) = 0, b equals 1. Plug this back into the equation and you would get a = 4. Check the answer and see if I’m right.”

    My live reaction while reading that: 
    ok. ok. uhh ok seperate the integral (what does that mean in this context?). hold up, why does the limit = 0 now? and did the integral part just totally disappear? plug it back into what? the original equation is still results in the indeterminate form and the only other equation shown doesn't have an "a". The [answer was correct at least](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/zgusupvmky). 

    But at this point, I needed to solve the problem myself so I could have an explanation for the "explanation".

    so here's my attempt at a hyper-compressed but still elucidating explanation.

    >!starting with original equation (from the raws) 

    >!evaluate at x=0 and note, 0/0

    >!apply L’Hopital’s rule (there's a neat little trick to sidestep evaluating the integral)

    >!evaluate at x=0 again and note, always 0 which is not 1 but if b=1 then indeterminate so maybe

    >!apply L’Hopital’s rule until a determinate form (twice more)

    >!and finally we have the limit in terms of a and b

    >!setting that equal to 1 and b=1 we have a=4


    Now that I look at it, it's kinda hard to compress an explanation so much. Probably also clearer [with the equations](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/b3zd5caxri) in front of you. 

    Anyway, rant over.

      I read through most of this. He continues on with the same general loop of study a lot, solve major problem, wow the world, repeat with some small variations in various fields for awhile. Of course, he’s a one-man research center but that’s part of the genre and is mildly entertaining. The math stuff I would guess is messed up due to translation errors, but the way he talks about technical things generally seems reasonable and most of his references seem to be believable. Most of his references to places and things seem accurate to me as well.  

      I would say it has a “smart” protagonist in the world of academia, which may appeal to this community. However, the character is not rational and most other characters’ lives seem to rotate around his in one way or another.

    I just started reading this, and while it was somewhat interesting to begin with, I just want to post one of my gripes here.

    The author doesn’t seem to know anything about programming. It’s quite infuriating, especially since they seem to know their way around maths, but they don’t seem to have taken the time to look up even some basic facts about programming. 

    Take this example, from Chapter 47:

    >	Technically, the crawler itself was not too difficult. The entire program was less than 30 lines. It compiled perfectly with no bugs.

    Seems alright at first glance, right? Well, he’s written it in Python. Anyone who has ever used Python, or even has the most cursory of knowledge on it knows that Python is *interpreted*.

    So yeah, I’d like to add to OP’s disclaimer. This story portrays computing science like it portrays women - even a 3-year-old could do better.
    ```

    - u/GlueBoy:
      ```
      I noticed that. I'm assuming the translator just chose a programmer-y sounding word. Even if the author made the mistake initially it would be something his huge Chinese audience immediately call out.
      ```

      - u/benchlordTheSecond:
        ```
        That's a fair point, but I'd just like to respectfully disagree with you. There are a lot more glaring factual errors in the text, and I don't think all of them could be attributed to translation errors. Here are some more examples from Chapter 47:

        >The reason why he chose the school’s computer room was mainly due to the fact that programs written in Python had to be run on a Linux computer. Thus, learning Python with a Linux operating system was necessary.

        This is just completely untrue. Python is by no means Linux-exclusive. You can run it on any platform. Even in 2014, (which is when the story appears to be set) you could run Python in Windows. Hell, you can even run Python in Minecraft.

        ~~>However, the Linux system was different. It was mainly based on command-line operations. Everything had to be done through the keyboard. Fortunately, the school installed a distribution with a desktop environment. Thus, Lu Zhou could still use the mouse.

        Yes, there is a bit more usage of the command line in Linux, but you can still do plenty with the GUI. It depends on the distro, but even if it’s for hardcore programming, I’m still doubtful that the non-terminal functionality is that limited.~~

        Edit: disregard this part, I am incorrect

        In conclusion, I'm kind of skeptical that the author even knows what they're talking about when it comes to programming, especially when the so-called "computer genius" calls programming an "esoteric field" which necessitates "planned systematic learning" just to learn the basics.
        ```

        - u/GlueBoy:
          ```
          Ok, now I'm remembering. That chapter was indeed particularly bad. 

          It is still possible that it's just the translator taking creative liberties, especially after what /u/creative_ennui wrote about how that equation was transcribed.

          Your point about Python interoperability is well taken, but I'm going to have to disagree with the rest of your disagreement.

          Fundamentally, a Linux system *is* command-line based. The author alludes to that with the line
          >  Fortunately, the school installed a distribution with a desktop environment.

          A GUI doesn't come standard on all flavors of Linux like it does windows - you have to actually install one. Granted, most popular distributions have one bundled in, but they're an addon, not  required.
          Often, server environments won't have one to save computational resources, and thin-client/SSH based setups are quite common in education settings.

    Wrong genre, but Beware of Chicken's protag has a similar philosophy of "that is a stupid and dangerous path, I'm going to go be a farmer instead."

    ```

      ```

      - u/gramineous:
        ```
        Yeah, that's pretty accurate.

        You could maybe look at Youjo Senki fic? This is a stretch for sure, but there should be something among that somewhere. Although canon is the protag going "I am going to be the flawless example of a productive member of society with no cracks in my outward appearance, as internally I want nothing more than safety and stability and don't want to be disdained and penalised for my selfish cowardice. Oh no, my exceptional performance and ability means my superiors have enough confidence to put me into a dangerous scenario, disappointing them with overt self-sabotage or out of character arguments would be disasterous towards everything I've built, I've got to try to push through, and maybe fail it in a way that looks unintentional!" There's enough possible settings for YS fic that I'm sure some of it has eschewed anything significantly dangerous or high stakes, even if the canon story is defined by its conflicts (isekai'd to magical WW1).

        Big stretch though.

          I have seen this as a manga!  It was relatively entertaining, but I did have qualms about the protagonist being basically on the side of a country intent on conquering the other countries.  I'm not aware of Youjo Senki fic though, have you read any you particularly enjoyed?

          There's Worm fanfic, of course, I vaguely recall Taylor-and-Transformers crossover, that was kind of hilarious and good in a cheesy way.
          ```

          - u/GlueBoy:
            ```
            The author of Youjo Senki actually goes to great (and somewhat unrealistic) pains to make the Empire(Germany+Austria Hungary) of the setting into the good guys, or at least not the bad guys. In the LN Germany is always invaded before they declare war on a country, and they then use that as pretext to counter-invade(lol) France and Scandinavia. They actually get invaded like 5x by like 6 different countries.

    Two things come to mind. 

    The Prince of Nothing trilogy- A fantasy series written by a Professor with a PhD in philosophy--and it shows. High focus on metaphyiscs/nature of reality, particularly the sequel trilogy. An example are the villains, beings from another dimension/plane who are stranded. They are depicted as utterly and irredeemably depraved and evil, but their goals are supremely rational given what they know of the metaphysics of their world. spoilers for book 2: >!religion is real, god is real, and most importantly, hell is real. An eternity in hell awaits the unfaithful, to which the only solution is what? Why, destroy all of existence, of course...!<


    Anathem - A long ass science fiction novel which deals with metaphysics/nature-of-Reality, but it's not its main focus. The story is long as fuck, has a long and slow buildup until the plot properly starts, and to top it off makes up its own vocabulary--it does it well, but that's a turn off to most people, because it takes work to read get immersed. Even then, it's very worth it, imo. One of my top 5 books of all time. 

    Some others:

    * Three worlds collide? 
    * Blindsight + sequels
    * Unsong
    * Manifold trilogy?
    * Machineries of Empire trilogy?
    ```

    - u/Sinity:

      Thanks for recommendations. I've already read Unsong & Three worlds collide; Unsong sorta fits what I meant.

      > Anathem (...) has a long and slow buildup until the plot properly starts, and to top it off makes up its own vocabulary -- it does it well, but that's a turn off to most people, because it takes work to read get immersed.

      I've read Snow Crash & Cryptonomicon and liked it, so I'll likely enjoy Anathem too. I like toying with language like that; [there's a great Polish book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_Imperfection), unfortunately not translated to English, which dumps the protagonist from near-future into the far future - and to make it more immersive, it doesn't really explain what do the characters mean when they use novel terminology -- at least until much later time in the book. It invents not only words; it invents new grammar (separate 'neutral' gender for post-humans) & notation (/verb & //verb for multiple instances/bodies) too.

      It starts like this:

      > On the fifth of July, the day of his daughter's wedding - it was a Sunday and the sun was thundering out of a cloudless blue, a salty wind was tugging the purple banners on the castle towers, birds were screaming - Judas McPherson, lord of the manor, **stahs of the First Tradition**, incumbent of both Lodges, owner of over two hundred **acres° of Plateau HS**, honorary member of the **Sol-Port** Pilot Council, president of Gnosis Incorporated, was murdered twice.

      Really confusing on first read, but satisfying afterwards. I've translated it with deepl.com; machine translation is getting pretty good, I didn't even change anything here and it looks fine. I'm thinking of attempting to translate the whole book, but I have no idea where I'd post it. Not sure if it'd fit this sub.

      > The Prince of Nothing 

      Sounds interesting, from looking at the Wiki it seems it even fits the sub.

        You're in for a treat with anathem then. Even the title is a made up word; a portmanteau of anthem and anathema, meaning a ritual wherein a monk is expelled from a convent.

        And Prince of Nothing definitely fits here. I believe it's even in our wiki.

  Any introspective stories with an emotionally... expressive/intelligent male lead? It seems like any book with introspection on a male protagonist inevitably tends towards depressed, traumatized ones (like Worth the Candle, Robin Hobb's Fitz series, etc). The closest I've found to having an emotionally intelligent character as well as introspection is probably Ar'kendrythist, mostly because the protagonist of that series has enough empathy and experience to know how to make himself happy, or at least work through trauma and grief. Don't even get me started on all the edgy "he's so dark and broody" protagonists who run headfirst into trauma and keep going due to male pride, then have to be "saved" by their romantic interest or friend or whatever.
  ```

  - u/GlueBoy:
    ```
    Introspection and emotional expressiveness does seem a bit at odds as character traits, but I'll try. 

    - Masters and Mages series - seems perfect to your request, but I believe you've already read it. 

    - Second Sons series - a good, rational book about an intelligent, goal oriented kid. I've recommended it here several times but I don't think it's gotten much play. 

    - Chronicles of Amber? - Not sure about this one, but the first series of five books are great. The story is told in first person by Corwin, the protagonist, and there is definitely introspection, IIRC. 

    - Vorkosigan Saga - not sure if I would characterize Miles as introspective, but he's definitely emotionally... pragmatic, self-aware, and has a great stream of consciousness via Bujold's writing.
    ```

    - u/CaramilkThief:
      ```
      I feel like emotional maturity and intelligence comes with a measure of introspection as well, since you'd have to know yourself enough. I don't really need the introspection part that much, but I'd prefer a male lead with emotional maturity/intelligence. 


      I tried the masters and mages trilogy yeah. I loved the first book but subsequent books made me appreciate it less as it went more and more into epic fantasy. I'll take a look at your other recs.
