## [REC] Lancelotian MC

### Post:

⚠ ⚠ ⚠ This is going to be pretty long. ⚠ ⚠ ⚠  

A bit of my philosophy: (i) Incompetence is a crime.

(ii) Mediocrity is a sin.

(iii) Competence is a virtue.

I'll list the traits of the MC:   

1. MC is consequentialist. MC doesn't believe in good and evil, and does not abide to conventional morality. MC's morality is this: "right" actions give a positive payoff. "Wrong" actions give a negative payoff. The rightness or wrongness of any decision he makes, is ***ONLY*** dependent on its payoff.

2. MC is male. For story with multiple MCs, at least one of them should match listed criteria.

3. MC is pragmatic and rational, MC isn't an idealist, he's realistic and pragmatic.

4. MC is ruled by reason not by emotions. His actions work with cost benefit analysis; 'will this have a positive or negative payoff?" and Bayesian decision making; "which decision has the highest expected value?". he also asks questions like; "How does this affect my goal?"

5. MC is utilitarian. He attaches a value to each human life, and other things. The worth of saving or sparing a life is that value. The cost of taking a life is that value. This may be implicit, not necessarily explicit.

6. MC prioritises efficiency in all his actions. The most efficient means to achieve his goal, the most reliable. He'll pursue the action with the highest expected value(Bayesian method of decision making). He wouldn't take a chance on a very low probability(no betting on potential or believing in spirit) unless there's a logical reason to do so.

7. MC is competent. He's capable and adept with respect to what he does, he does not need to be the best, but he should be highly proficient and accurately estimate his ability. Above the 99th percentile(most likely more) in his field(s) in his universe.

8. MC is highly intelligent, no need to be a genius, but at the very least in the 99th percentile of intelligence; somewhere north of 145 with SD of 15. Bonus if he's a genius. Doesn't have to be explicitly stated, we readers should be able to infer it.

9. MC has a goal. He has an overarching goal, that drives his actions and may have other sub goals he pursues.

10. MC is manipulative, a schemer and a planner. He makes carefully thought out plans and commits to them. He prefers brain over brawn and believes his biggest asset is his brain. He understands the value of information, and actively exploits it. He has backup plans for plausible scenarios, but can manage through unexpected scenarios. He's robust, even if something unaccounted for happens, he can deal with it.

11. MC is meticulous, he pays careful attention to detail. He's not careless.

12. MC has pride. I'm not asking for unnecessary arrogance, but he has pride in what he does. He's capable, and knows his capable. He takes pride in his abilities. But he shouldn't be ruled by his pride.

13. MC's goal may be beneficial e.g world peace, neutral e.g world domination(such an MC will actually bring about a more prosperous world after they take over), or hostile e.g World destruction. The MC may even have vengeance as a goal, his goals may be influenced by emotions, but not his actions. I wouldn't want mediocre goals though. Of he's pursuing vengeance then the target of revenge should be larger than life and also very competent.

 

Any genre that encompasses these elements will do; sci-fi, fantasy, horror, etc.

 

Bonus

14. MC is involved in politics wherever he finds himself

 

I'm not asking for a Gary Stu. Not an omniscient or omnipotent MC. He can have flaws and weaknesses, as long as those 14 requirements aren't violated. He may have a God complex like Light Yagami. He may have a Messiah complex(filtered through his own amoral world view) like Emiya Shirou. He may be nihilist, and see this world and humanity as beyond hope. He may think that there world needs to be destroyed to be saved. He may hate the world and want to destroy it. He should have flaws and emotions. I want a real feasible person, not a perfect robot.

He may have noble pride as his flaw. He may have deep hubris in his lineage and his house.

MC should have emotions and be a real human being. He just shouldn't let his emotions rule him. Or at least that should be his principle. He's human, so making an emotional mistake may happen.

I don't want a story where there are no consequences for his less rational choices. If he goofs up, there should be consequences for it. If he decides to prioritise something over his goal maybe the life of someone precious to him, then it should affect his plans, everything shouldn't somehow magically work for his benefit. He should have zero plot armour, and narrativium shouldn't help him. His luck should be average or less than. I don't want a "lucky" MC. No Deus Ex Machinas please.

There should be real consequences for his actions.

I want a plausible story; a story I don't need to keep suspending disbelief to read.

Simply put I don't want plot armour.

I know this was a chore to read. I'll take anime, manga, Asian translated novels, Original English Novels, Western Novels, comics, etc.

I'll take anything as long as it is FREELY available online in ENGLISH. The story should have at least a few 100 000 words(or equivalent content for videos and comics). I'm expecting at least a 1000 pages of English content(or equivalent). If there's less, but over 100,000 words and releases are steady and at a reasonable pace, the recommendation will be much appreciated.

Any genre will do, as long as it involves political machinations. I expect the MC to have or eventually get some kind of leadership role.

I'm okay with genocide if it's a rational choice, but I'll be put off by someone killing villager A for no reason or for something mundane like being in a bad mood. I think it's the thought behind the crime that decides it for me.

I don't really care whether the MC wins or loses, it's the journey for me.

PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE. This is the most important recommendation thread I'm requesting for. I'll be eternally grateful to someone who can fix me up. If you can get me a dose of my crack, i'll be indebted.


### Comments:

  ```
  The [Prince of Nothing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_of_Nothing) series sound right up your alley. It's a very complex series for me to try to describe, but the main character Kellhus fits your requirements almost perfectly. The only catch is that we learn very little about his inner thoughts despite following him for so much of the book and readers are left to decide on their own whether or not he's evil or amoral. Some people find the book boring due to the extensive world-building. I highly recommend reading the reviews on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B010MEPN14/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1) or some other site before deciding to read the book. It's fairly easy to find free copies of the first book online, but the rest of the series you might have to buy. Try bookzz.org if you have very little money to spend.

  The [Crystal Society](http://crystal.raelifin.com/about/) is about an artificial intelligence named Face who sounds more feminine than masculine, but there is so much social manipulation in her every thoughts and action that I think you'll like reading about her any way due to how her single desire is to be **known** by every human and she only (barely) follows conventional human morality publicly to look 'benevolent' to humans because fame is better than infamy. The first book is free online, but you will have to buy the second one and the third one is coming out roughly in December.

  [Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality](http://www.hpmor.com/) features a version of Harry who is considered to be *intensely* moral by many people on this subreddit due to his idealistic desire to want everyone to never ever die, including people considered to be evil. This moral conflict between him and the rest of wizarding society who thinks Death is "The next great adventure" is a major part of the story albeit not all of it. There's a *lot* going on throughout. Since you sound like you like moral conflicts, I suspect you'll enjoy Harry. It's free online.

  [Ender's Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender's_Game) is a classic which you probably heard of before so I won't get into it too much. I'll just point out that Ender is considered by the subreddit one of the few examples of an genuinely intelligent characters in popular literature where we actually can learn good habits of thinking rather than a "genius" character who we are told rather than shown to be smart. I'll be stunned if free copies of this book can't be found somewhere online with some googling.

  [Worm](https://parahumans.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/) a whopping monster at *2 million* words long and all entirely free online. Features a female superhero who constantly finds herself making horrible decisions in her pursuit to be a hero. Fans often comment on her doing "the wrong things for the right reasons". Taylor is exceptionally cunning, pragmatic, and clever as a [Third Level Character](http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/level3intelligent). She's female, but her gender is such a minor aspect of the story that I rarely noticed or thought about it.

  [Blindsight](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Blindsight) is an amazing book about people with very unusual ways of thinking and bizarre moralities along with aliens who genially feel like they are aliens rather than Star Trek aliens who are humans painted a different color. I can't write a summary good enough to do this book justice, but the TV Tropes link is very informative and will bring you to a free online copy of the book.

  There are a lot of good rational fiction on [TV Tropes](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RationalFic) I would recommend for hours of pleasurable reading, but there aren't any other fiction I can think of on that page which fulfills your main amoral requirement.

  PS What does 'lancelotian' mean? I tried looking it up, but google doesn't tell me the meaning. I'm guessing something to do with amoral and probably a historical connection to Lancelot somehow. Or is it just a word you made up to identify characters similar to Lancelot?

  EDIT: Looking at your post again, I think you are very heavily influenced by characterizations of the heroes in xianxia novels. The genre as a whole is considered by this subreddit to be very stagnant as mentioned by the top comment on this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4ab3xk/recommendations_xianxia_is_a_good_genre_and_you/). [Forty Millenniums of Cultivation](https://friendshipispower.wordpress.com/about/) is the rare exception which is liked by this subreddit. I think you have been reading so much of xianxia that you are desperate for something different, but are so used to reading stories from that genre that you haven't considered trying other types of stories. The only reason for my thoughts about you is because we had some people come to this subreddit from /r/noveltranslations asking for recommendations before and they made very similar requests to you.

  EDIT 2: I just realized that while I was recommending books, there were two comics I would recommend as well.

  [Leftover Soup](http://www.leftoversoup.com/) is a comic at only 970 pages with the author saying that he will be finishing it at exactly 1,000 pages. So it's not as long as you wanted, but the characters constantly discuss deep, thought provoking topics many of which are very easy to to get into arguments over (for pete's sake, the first page involves a rape joke!). They also often end up discussing whether or not a given horrible action is required due to one's moral philosophy/religion, so I think you'll like it despite the near total lack of any of your requirements.

  [Freefall](http://freefall.purrsia.com/) is another comic which doesn't fulfill any of your requirements, but it's a very lengthy comic (several thousand strips) which examines the implications of alien and artificial minds which are similar to human minds, but are nonetheless different enough to make coexistence difficult.

    I'm loving Crystal Society. That was a quality recommendation. It's always a treat to come across a protagonist with an inhuman utility function, because it turns a lot of the usual storytelling conventions on their side and lets you vicariously experience an unfamiliar mode of thinking.
    ```

  - u/eaglejarl:
    ```
    LeftoverSoup ends at 1000 strips? Drat! I love that strip.
    ```

    - u/xamueljones:
      ```
      Agreed! But Tailsteak says somewhere in one of his early strips that he planned right from the start to make Leftover Soup exactly 1,000 pages long. To reinforce this, he mentioned that he would be finishing Leftover Soup in 2017 back in December when he was around strip #950. His reason for doing so is because he wanted to tell a story with a beginning, middle, and end unlike most webcomics which only have a beginning, middle, and just continues on forever without any ending.

  >MC is male. For story with multiple MCs, at least one of them should match listed criteria.

  Why? The rest seems to follow similar themes.

  >MC is amoral. MC doesn't believe in good and evil, and does not abide to conventional morality.

  A lot of the MC's around here have decided that at least seeming to abide by conventional morality is useful. You don't often see protagonists completely ignoring conventional morality, if only for the reason that having a track record of adhering to conventional morality is a *very* good thing.

  Outside of that, you often see them adhering to unconventional moral frameworks. It's important to note that that does *not* make them amoral in any way. We probably want to avoid words like "amoral". We want to avoid that as a group in general, and any appearance of evil should be the cartoon villain level.

  Honestly, the way you phrased this request is off-putting. It reads like a list of demands--"I *expect* this, I *expect* that." Also, why do people keep insisting on male MCs?
  ```

  - u/eaglejarl:
    ```
    The charitable explanation is that they themselves are male and cannot identify with non-male characters.
    ```

    - u/CeruleanTresses:
      ```
      He did confirm that to be the case, but that's something that never made sense to me. There are so many points of divergence between a reader and a fictional person, of which gender is only one. Why should specifically gender be a deal-breaker with respect to the reader's ability to identify with the character? I'm a woman and there are certainly male characters I identify with.
      ```

      - u/eaglejarl:
        ```
        > Why should gender be the deal breaker?

        The charitable explanation is that gender is a real-world characteristic and major part of most people's identity, unlike "is a wizard" or "is a troll".  There are a lot of non-charitable ones.
        ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        As for Identifying with women, I guess the literature we grew up reading matters, ggrowing up in an environment, that made me proud to be born male, and in a fundamentalist christian home( where wives are supposed to be subject to their husbands), I grew up with the belief that men are superior. A belief that's hard to discard, regardless of the truth of that belief, I was made proud to be male. I also grew up reading male MCs. It's quite late and hard to start identifying with female MCs.

        I believe in equality more or less though(equal legal consideration for one).
        ```

        - u/CeruleanTresses:
          ```
          I hope you're still actively working to overcome the belief that men are superior. You're aware that it's an irrational and false belief that was pushed on you as a child, so there's no excuse for giving up on overcoming it.

    Seconding. 

    What is up with all these people asking for male MCs? This is the third one in the past couple of months, I'm pretty sure. 

    You ever notice that we don't have anybody coming in and requesting that we give only stories that have female MCs?
    ```

    - u/Iconochasm:
      ```
      There's a common criticism of SJWs regarding fiction.  It generally goes something like "The inability to identify with characters who don't match the reader's exact demographics betrays a failure of empathy and conceptual ability".  I suspect we're seeing the wild version of that trait, without the ideological framework.  Or a more charitable possibility, as /u/hoja_nasredin suggested, a misfiring heuristic to avoid anvil-dropping.

      I also suspect that people asking for female MCs would be more likely to ask in a more women-oriented/dominated venue.  I see them occasionally in /r/fantasy, for example, and I'd be shocked if there weren't /TwoXFiction type subs.
      ```

      - u/CeruleanTresses:
        ```
        Just for clarification: Asking that uncommon demographics be respectfully represented in fiction (instead of ignored entirely, or represented only as objects of ridicule) isn't about being unable to identify with other types of characters. 

        The issue is that our mental model of human society is heavily influenced by fiction. For, say, a gay person to see gay characters represented in fiction as people worthy of basic respect is validating to their identity. Conversely, to see an absence of gay characters gives the impression that they're weird, uniquely broken people unworthy of a place in society (this is particularly damaging to young people still coming to grips with their identity). 

        I have a personal experience with this. As an aromantic asexual person, I *never* came across characters who were like me while I was growing up, except in the form of heartless, sociopathic villains. I wasn't even aware that that was a way "real" people could be. It took me a long time to accept that I genuinely lacked romantic and sexual attraction, and even longer to stop thinking of it as something wrong with me. I believe that seeing respectful depictions of aromantic and/or asexual characters in fiction would have helped me accept myself much earlier, and saved me a lot of heartache.

        Just as importantly, respectful representation also affects how the rest of society thinks of your demographic. If you're a gay person surrounded by people who never see gay characters in fiction, or see them depicted only as perverts, that will affect the way they treat you. I believe that the increasing amount of positive representation of LGBT+ characters has done enormous good in shifting perceptions of LGBT+ people, in a feedback loop that then further encourages representation. I've watched my own mother's opinion of trans people change dramatically just over the course of a single TV show centered on trans characters.

      not !Male MCs sometimes (in my experience around 20% of fics) means author tries to make a gender equality point in his work. And having someone preaching at you through the whole story gets on your nerves.
      ```

      - u/callmebrotherg:
        ```
        Then why not say, "Fics without preaching?"
        ```

        - u/nolobargescope:
          ```
          Not specific enough. HPMOR has a lot of preaching, it just happens to be about politics and utilitarianism and AI safety.

          And between "no female MC please" and "no feminist preaching please", I do wonder which would cause the greatest furore in comments...

    First. Not about fiction at all, but read some www.slatestarcodex.com, particularly [his article on Moloch](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/). Wrong though that blog sometimes is, it is a thing to cherish. If you like it, read on.

    So, there's a comment above which says "you don't belong here." I'm going to put my foot in it. They are both completely wrong and also accurate. Culturally, you're a poor fit, your expressed desires and viewpoints too vulgar and unrefined. But you're probably a dozen times more like the average lesswrong member than that average member was before reading Yudkowsky, and for good or ill lesswrong and Yudkowsky are/were the backbone of this community. This place absolutely has what you want and that is in no way limited to being a source of fiction.

    You say you came here from /r/noveltranslations. The typical light novel is, well, pretty fucking low IQ, and that's coming from somebody that has a great deal of contempt for the fetish people around here have for the term IQ. The /r/rational sub is ostensibly focussed on "rational" fiction, but in fact it is a hub for the LessWrong exodus's Rationality community. People here care first and formost about ideals, ideas, how to live in the real world, and discussion around that. /r/rational is the sub that aggregates Rational fiction for these people due to the historical accident of Yudkowsky's magnum opus proselytizing peice being a "rational" fiction work, making such fiction an interest in its own right for these people. But if you come in only caring about fiction and talking as though that matters and you're ignorant of local rules and customs and cultural viewpoints and values, you might get told you're in the wrong place.

    You're not in the wrong place, but you have an amazing experience of growing and learning ahead of you (I imagine anyway, from what you've said, that you'll like what you found around these parts, and many, myself excluded, have found the LessWrong and related material profound and life-changing.)  

    So, you should read www.lesswrong.com 's Sequences. You should read www.slatestarcodex.com . You should take a peak at /r/slatestarcodex . See if these seem to be things you'll value. If they do, welcome to the community.
