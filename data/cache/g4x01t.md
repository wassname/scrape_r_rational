## Empress Theresa was so awful it gave me ideas

### Post:

Note: This is just a discussion. I don't have space on my slate to write anything with this in the foreseeable future. So anyone who's interested is welcome to run with the idea.

Note 2: I mention the book's insensitivity towards Israelis below. Let's just say it's stunning.

Having seen [the relevant episode of Down The Rabbit Hole](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TedsiCaV2B4) a while back, lately I've been following KrimsonRogue's multi-part review of a self-published novel named "Empress Theresa". Fair warning: the full review runs over six hours. [Here's part one.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JopR-biL0I4)

In this novel, a 19-year-old girl becomes omnipotent to the limit of her imagination. As you'd expect, she is pretty snotty about it. As you probably expect, she proceeds to Ruin Everything. As you definitely wouldn't expect, *the entire world is fine with this*.

I can't do it justice with a summary, but to give an example of the calibre of ideas here, Theresa's idea to 'solve' the Middle East is to make a brand new island and move all Israelis there. *An island shaped like the Shield of David.* She has the power to do these things unilaterally, has no inhibitions about doing so, and is surrounded by yes-folk up to and including heads of state.

Anyway. Towards the end, the idea of other people gaining similar powers is mentioned, immediately alarming Theresa, and that was when I started thinking "fix fic". I don't currently have time, and definitely don't have the geophysics or politics knowledge, to write this. But if anyone else finds the Mary Sue potential interesting, I'd enjoy hearing what you'd do with this awful setting.

The difficulty factor for our rational newborn space wizards seems to be down to two things (not counting the many ways you could ruin things with your powers if you're careless - Theresa's already done plenty of that by this point. Exploding. North. Pole): firstly, learning to communicate with the entity granting you the powers, which took Theresa a while, and secondly, having only a very limited time before Theresa makes her move to eliminate her rivals. You are at least forewarned because the US president announces everything Theresa does.

Yeah, I did say exploding North Pole.

  ... wow, that's insane. I mean, the solution I'd go for creating a number of pocket-dimension copies of the regions, overwriting the original one, and glue them together with each other and the rest of the planet along the edges (or perhaps something less topologically troublesome). Then every side gets their own equally real copy of the entire region.

    Leading to:

    1) Each faction now believes that in order to keep the original holy region free of the infidel, they must gain full control of *all* the copies of the regions; and/or  
    2) They blame you for destroying the 'original holy land' because no-one can tell if any of the copies is the 'real' one.
    ```

      ```
      just lie

      tell people that you destroyed the other faction and they better behave or else you'll destroy them too

          If you are actually omnipotent, spawn two whole earths with copies of most of the people, one where each side "won" and the other side vanished.

          And do that for all the permutations of every conflict.

      1. is solvable by making any specific copy accessible only if it's the one you were 'assigned' to, so it's impossible to interact with more than one region
      2. solves the problem (who cares that they blame you?)

    What could be an interesting variation: every time someone from one of the bickering factions enters the disputed zone, a new copy of the zone is generated (and it vanishes when they leave). They get to have their very own holy region all to themselves, meaning it 100% belongs to whatever that one person wants it to belong to, for as long as they're prepared to stay there.

    Anyone not in the bickering factions gets to enter the original version. Which is probably now significantly calmer.

      I like this one because it gives me vibes of "everyone gets their personal Disneyland - with NO QUEUES!"

      And, myself belonging to the autism faction, I'd kind of like access to an at-will human-free pocket dimension too. Recharge in there and rejoin the human race when stress levels are normalised.

    No because that's heresy. From the authors website:

    >Theresa’s faith is the source of her triumph﻿. Take a large group of people.  Impose the same difficult situation on them.  Gradually increase the difficulty and watch what happens.  One by one people will drop out of the challenge.

    >Theresa is challenged with difficulties she calls 'impossible', but she doesn't give up.  To much is at stake to give her the luxury of walking away.  

    >What keeps her going?  She trusts that God will get her through it somehow.  Later in the story President Stinson expressed this idea:  "I can't believe a God who brought her this far without making mistakes will let her make one now."
    ```

      ```
      See, whenever I read these stories where people get the ability to overcome all obstacles simply by wanting the thing bad enough, I picture omnipotent toddlers steamrolling humanity.
      ```

      - u/Suitov:
        ```
        Theresa basically is a toddler, morally and in terms of common sense. Her intelligence is informed but definitely not shown on page...
        ```

- u/CompactDisko:
  ```
  I feel like a omnipotent rational protagonist wouldn't be a very interesting story and might not be possible to write at all. The first thing they should do is make themselves superintellegent and omniscient, so they have perfect information and can make the absolute best decisions. Then solving every problem wouldn't be much different than playing a perfect game of tic tac toe. The problem with writing this is I don't think it's possible to show the perspective of someone so far beyond human level intelligence. You could write it from another perspective, but finding satisfying solutions to every problem that everyone realistically agrees with is going to be impossibly hard as well.
  ```

  - u/immortal_lurker:
    ```
    You could write a nearly omnipotent protagonist who was *trying* to be rational.

    The first step would have them be deathly afraid of modifying their own mind.

    Even if you do have them be smart enough to try intelligence enhancement, you could have them be concerned about what the optimal state even is. What *do* they do about the Middle East? Do they just sort of hope people stop caring about it once all their needs are taken care of? When they try to duplicate the space, what do they do with the people who aren't satisfied with that solution?

    How do they handle religious people who think they are tampering in gods domain? How do they handle religious people who think the protagonist is god?

    Do they start a super powered CPS? Does anyone have a right to privacy from the demi-urge? Does anyone get to vote on measures?

    At this point, it is basically a discourse on ethics with a super powered being acting as the viewpoint character.
    ```

    - u/RMcD94:
      ```
      All of those things seem very small minded. What's the middle east in context of a trillion stars?p

      Why would you even have planets or the sun or anything like that? Just inefficient.

      Turn the whole universe into a dense constant bliss
      ```

  - u/Calsem:
    ```
    Instead of making them omnipotent you could just make them powerful reality benders. They would still have the problem of them upgrading themselves to the point of omnipotency but you could just hand wave that away by saying reality bending doesn't allow that for whatever magic reason.
    ```

    - u/BoojumG:
      ```
      >saying reality bending doesn't allow that

      Or that they've got reality-bending but they've still got to do the hard work of figuring out what constitutes an upgrade.

      You do quickly run into the problem of being unable to predict the actions of someone smarter than you though. You're forced into describing what it might be like to watch it from the outside and in vague terms, and describing outcomes but not how they are accomplished.
      ```

  - u/CWRules:
    ```
    The problem with writing superintelligent characters is you run head-first into [Vinge's Law](https://arbital.com/p/Vinge_law/). In order to know what a superintelligence will do, you must be a superintelligence yourself.
    ```

  - u/Suitov:
    ```
    Yes - an unopposed omnipotent protag would make a boring book, as it did with Empress Theresa. This is why I didn't think there was much potential in the original concept, but once the omnipotent 'villain' was established and basically in control of the world, and the story briefly introduced the prospect of new omnipotents arising to oppose her, *that* felt like it had more potential.

    Big powers need to come with equally big setbacks in order to make a happy ending feel earned.

  I'm kind of in awe of the sheer pettiness of a \*6 hour review\*.  Like, there's 'living in your head rent free', and then there's whatever this is.
  ```

  - u/Suitov:
    ```
    It all started when a reader suggested KR (this reviewer) to the author, who is kind of notorious for arguing with reviewers who don't like his book, and said (truthfully) that KR reviews lesser-known works and is fair in his reviews. The author responded scathingly, and when KR heard about that exchange, that's when the pettiness came in.

    The scary part is that the six-hour review is actually truncated from his notes. KR has a gimmick of adding coloured note tabs to the books he reviews - one colour for spelling/grammar errors, one for plot points to discuss, whatever. This book, when he held it in shot, looked like a rainbow porcupine. The guy is thorough.

  Honestly I'm probably a terrible person to become the omnicisacent space wizard because I wouldn't just tinker. I'd go wild and split the world up into something the size of Jupiter covered with floating islands each big enough for a nice house with a large garden. 

  Each person is given one island and a copy of my powers that only works within the bounds of their island. All islands are also encased in an indestructible shell to prevent you conjuring up a bunch of nuclear missiles and firing them. The only way to visit another island is to be invited, and everyone has an unblockable teleport home power to prevent someone using their power to keep them prisoner. nd of course, there's 

  That's the core concept, but there's lots of little details and improvements. Keep the internet for socialisation, neutral islands that can serve as places to socialise physically, and of course a set up for childcare. Probably they get their own no-powers island with parents having auto-permission to visit. 

  I'm sure there's thousands of ways it could go wrong, which is why I shouldn't be given infinite power.

    I do absolutely adore the aesthetic of this. Floating islands, sky oceans...

    And I felt that "I'm probably a terrible person to become the space wizard" so hard because yeah. I have very human, i.e. skewed, priorities. "Make all dogs immortal" would be my training-wheels project. "Raise red pandas to sapience" would be my next, slightly further-reaching project. Humanity would be put on pause for these, so I could work out most of the bugs before risking harm to already-existing people. Basically Earth would be my learner world, and after *that* was a safe, bio-diverse, stable garden planet, I'd start branching out and growing bolder...

    (Loved that episode and the short story it's based on.) If only the author were more self-aware, it would've been a wonderful horror book.  As it is, it's only unintentionally horrifying.  Though [Fridge Horror](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror) (TV Tropes warning) does have a special charm of its own.

  Wildbow was apparently considering writing a story like that before he started Worm. In [a comment](https://parahumans.wordpress.com/2012/09/29/prey-14-8/#comment-4589) he says that one of the possible protagonists for his Parahumans story was a new Parahuman on the world of Earth Supreme, where a cape named Goddess rules over the entire world, as she has many really strong powers, among those is one that makes other capes "aligned" to her by changing their priorities to always think of her interests before anything else.

  That setting (or more like, its remnants after Gold Morning) is explored somewhat in Ward. >!The people who were oppressed by capes during Goddess' rule violently overthrew their rulers, and forged a factious world government. They are *extremely* cape-phobic, while simultaneously having some of the most advanced research on powers.!<

  The  author has a page on their website dedicated to explaining how the book is genius, and it's goddamn hilarious

  http://empresstheresa.com/genius

  Some highlights:

  >Empress Theresa raises the bar of modern day writing in many ways.

  >Point 1: The story is about a teenage girl just setting out to finding her place in the world. The flexibility and potential of youth define the future. This is illustrated in Theresa who changes the world with her firm moral compass and bravery.

  >Point 4: Empress Theresa has an outstanding role model. Theresa is a wonderful girl.  Amazon five star reviewer Non mess writes, ‘’Give empress theresq a try if you're seeking a good role model.’’ A mother who read the book with her nine yo daughter wrote. ‘’ My daughter's words.....I like Theresa. She is a nice girl and there are not many of those these days. I hope I am a good girl. I want to be good too.’’﻿

  > Point 5:  Empress Theresa has simplicity. The recent bestseller "The Girl With A Dragon Tattoo" according to the wikipedia article about the book has twenty-nine characters.  Empress Theresa has only ten major speaking roles: Theresa and Steve Hartley, Jan Struthers, Father Donuoughty, Prime Minister Blair, Prime Minister Scherzer, President Stinson, and in the Parker mansion,  Edmund and Helen Parker, and Arthur Bemming.  Their relationships with each other and with Theresa are simple because they have no conflicting interests.  They all want Theresa to succeed.

  >Besides few characters Empress Theresa is simple in not requiring the reader to  have knowledge of any career.  Theresa never has a job. She is a student, and then she is technically speaking unemployed

  >Point 8:  Empress Theresa dares to mention God and his involvement in human events﻿.  Some people don't like to be reminded of that.

  >A novel is supposed to illutrate reality. There is no reality more important than our total dependence on God.  There is not a single atome in the center of the largest star in the most distant galaxy that would remain in existence one nanosecord if God didn't keep it in existence.  Similarly, we would collapse back into the nothingness from which we came if God didn't sustain us.  Theresa is conscious of this and puts her trust in Him.

  >15 As symbolized by the above list, Theresa shows genius in bringing together volumes of information from many sources although there is nothing in her background to prepare her 

  >In the history of the human intellect, untrained, inexperienced, and using only its birthright equipment of untried capacities, there is nothing which approaches this. Joan of Arc stands alone, and must continue to stand alone, by reason of the unfellowed fact that in the things wherein she was great she was so without shade or suggestion of help from preparatory teaching, practice, environment, or experience. There is no one to compare her with, none to measure her by.﻿

  EDIT:

  >From an internet troll's 'review' (??!!) on Amazon......

  >QUOTE

  >"There are parts throughout the novel where it was complete agony for me because there's nothing going on. " ﻿

  >END QUOTE ﻿

  >I have a list of 34 'spectacular and riveting' events in Empress Theresa. That's an average of one event every 13.64 pages. How many stories have you read that can keep up that frantic pace? ﻿

  That's a whole 0.07 events per page! have you ever heard of such a fast paced and riveting story?

  I wonder if this is actually a real model of what normal people would do if they had unlimited power. We might think that people are largely reasonable, that they'd consult with planners before reshaping the world but maybe they wouldn't. Maybe they'd just subconsciously will everyone to be yes-men and approve fawningly of whatever inane nonsense they'd do?

  Real government leaders are barely less moronic oftentimes. Nigeria managed to bungle vast oil wealth in a [tragic concrete farce](https://www.shippingsolutions.com/blog/the-nigerian-cement-story-2). North Korea tried to [deflate](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevehanke/2018/04/24/north-koreas-economic-crisis-what-crisis/#cdfd5a8437a9) its currency in 2010 x100 to deal with inflation.

    Having read the plot summary on TVTropes, I did briefly wonder if Norman was going for some kind of irony, wherein the ridiculous power Theresa has goes to her head, and the story is told from the villains point of view.

    However, I then realised this is not what he intended :(
