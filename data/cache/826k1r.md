  Author recommendation: Daniel Abraham (Aka, M.L.N. Hanover and half of James S.A. Corey).

  In general, he writes almost-rational stories, with some selfish, idealistic, uninformed, etc. characters that *create* problems despite the intelligent application of their knowledge and resources.  For example (vague enough to avoid spoilers), a character meddles with forces beyond his comprehension and nearly causes an extinction-level catastrophe.  The characterization and worldbuilding is good enough that everything seems inevitable in hindsight and theoretically predictable, but it still managed to surprise me with twists and turns I didn't see coming.

  Another thing that sets his writing apart is that time passes and things change.  I can't nail down why the changes in the Expanse, the Long Price Quartet and The Dagger and the Coin feel more real and impactful than the ones in Harry Potter, The Wheel of Time, The Dresden Files, The Belgariad, and the Amber books, but the difference is night and day.  The stories are set in a living world that reacts to world-changing events *as if the world has changed*.  It seems like each book in a series shifts genres a bit to show this as well.

  For specific book/series recommendations:

  The Long Price Quartet (starting with A Shadow in Summer): High fantasy setting, with one empire controlling *Andat*, which are bound philosophical principles (eg. Stone-made-Soft or Removing-the-Part-that-Continues) that serve as both industrial tools (stone pottery, de-seeding cotton and abortions) and nuclear-level deterrents (melting a continent, ecological catastrophe).  The first book covers an attempted invasion (by political means) of that magic-wielding empire, and a couple of characters on each side.  

  The Expanse (starting with Leviathan Wakes): Space opera that respects F = ma and other standard physics and economics (e.g. Terraforming Mars will take centuries of concentrated effort by millions of people).  The setting has three main factions: Earth, with billions of people, Mars, with millions of experts at everything, and the (Asteroid-)Belters, who live on the fringes of society.  There are cultural clashes, conspiracies, miscommunications, etc. that complicate the plot, and also talking problems through that preempts conflicts.  The first book is mystery-like, with a murdered girl and an attack on a freighter being the driving ideas for the main characters.

  The Dagger and the Coin (starting with The Dragon's Path): Fantasy set in a mostly post-magic world.  There are different races of humanity (elf-like, otter-like, bug-like, underground specialized, etc.), indestructible roads between cities, and a few (very minor) mages, but everyday life doesn't contain any magic.  It starts with three threads: a fairly standard war, with an incompetent and vengeful pawn who dabbles in philosophy is put in charge of a conquered city and proceeds to royally fuck everything up, an apostate from the (secret) Church of the Spider Goddess, who have the power to detect lies, and also anyone who hears them believe what they say, and a banker's apprentice who needs to navigate a warzone.

  The Black Sun's Daughter (starting with Unclean Spirits): is urban fantasy, focusing on Jayne, a woman who inherited her uncles responsibilities as basically a demon hunter after his death.  She doesn't have the training, and his allies (who she also inherited) aren't nearly as good as he was, so they're having trouble accomplishing their goals.  I haven't read past the first book yet, but I'm planning to after I catch up with other things.  I think it's probably the worst fit for me and this sub, but still a good book (and probably series).

  Request: 

  Podcasts with people talking about their disagreements, and really trying to get to the heart of where they disagree. [Intelligence Squared](https://www.intelligencesquaredus.org/) is the closest one I’m aware of, but they often move on just when I feel like they’re zeroing in on the actual disagreement. 

  Other things that are kind of close to what I’m looking for:

  [
  Conversations with people who hate me](http://www.dylanmarron.com/podcast/): It’s a really good podcast for the question “how can you have civil conversation with someone very different than yourself,” but I’m looking for “Now that civility has been established, let’s proceed to talk about the actual issue.” 

  [
  The Atheist Experience](http://www.atheist-experience.com/): A call-in show show mostly centered around theists calling in to talk about the “Is there a God?” question. I would say It’s around 50% atheists asking questions, or voicing their appreciation for the show, 40% theists bringing the same 3 arguments, and 10% actually interesting conversations. 


  [
  Judge John Hodgman](http://www.maximumfun.org/shows/judge-john-hodgman): 2 people having a personal dispute agree to have it decided by the judge of this podcast. I like this podcast because, with the wide variety of people they have on, it’s a good way of exploring the [fractally nested human subcultures](https://xkcd.com/1095/). It’s not quite what I’m looking for with the request, though, because there’s rarely much emotional weight to the disagreement, and, to get on the podcast in the first place necessitates that the two people have reached a point where further conversations between themselves is no longer useful.

  The six Titus Crow books:

  [*The Burrowers Beneath* and *The Transition of Titus Crow*](https://archive.org/details/tituscrowburrowe00luml)

  [*The Clock of Dreams* and *Spawn of the Winds*](https://archive.org/details/tituscrow00bria)

  [*In the Moons of Borea* and *Elysia*](https://archive.org/details/tituscrowburrowe03luml)

  As an aside, once you borrow a book from the internet archive, most books have the option to download a DRM-protected PDF that'll open in [Adobe Digital Editions](https://www.adobe.com/solutions/ebook/digital-editions/download.html) and then expire 2 weeks after you checked out the book.

  I'm not making any suggestions, I'm just making a factual statement which is not meant to be taken as an endorsement of any particular course of action; it is incredibly easy to Google the words "pdf drm removal" and find a program which allows you to remove the digital rights management technology from the PDF and keep it permanently (and open it with whatever PDF reader you normally use rather than Digital Editions).

  Another fact: Doing such a thing and only borrowing a book for the 5 minutes necessary to convert it and then returning it immediately significantly increases the turnover rate and gives more people the opportunity to read the book. Joining the waitlist for a checked-out book with only a single person ahead of you on the waitlist means you could have to wait for up to a month for the book to become available again, by which time you could have forgotten you were waiting for a book and then miss your 24-hour window to borrow it.

  Another fact: Artificial scarcity is stupid.

  As for the books I recommended, they're horror/adventure books based on the Lovecraft mythos, but the main character has a clock the size of a coffin which is *bigger on the inside* which allows him to *travel through the multiverse*. The characters also fight back against the Cthulhuian monsters, instead of just sort of puttering around like the characters in Lovecraft's stories. The writing is pulpish, you can definitely tell it was written in the '70s in emulation of older writing styles. It's like someone stuck Lovecraft, Sherlock Holmes, Edgar Rice Burroughs, and Doctor Who into a blender. The story itself is pretty over-the-top, especially later in the series. It's great fun.

  Right, so last month's rec thread spawned a chain of me reading Culture-crossovers that culminated in me reading a Worm-Culture fanfic and really liking it, despite the fact that I've tried reading Worm before and never been able to actually get through it; the premise, characters, and world are really interesting, but Wildbow's writing *stresses me the fuck out* between how obvious it is that the characters' decisions will lead to terribleness and how the narrative relentlessly progresses with no time to breathe. 

  The conclusion I have drawn is that is I really like Worm when Wildbow isn't writing it. Not having familiarity with canon meant I had to rely a fair bit on the Worm wikia to check who people/concepts were that fanfic authors elided, but it was a price I didn't mind paying. And so I am going to share my favorite fanfics here, so people who are in similar boats may have the opportunity to enjoy the parahuman world like I did.

  * *[Cenotaph](http://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/cenotaph-worm.273255/)* and its sequels *[Wake](http://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/wake-worm-au-thread-2.310371/)* and *[Legacy](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/legacy-worm.345448/)*. Listing this first because it's most similar to canon. Taylor decides to try out with the Wards instead of going on a solo patrol, her name gets leaked, and Bakuda murders her father. From this dark point of divergence comes a really gripping story that actually felt much more hopeful to me than canon-Worm. Legacy is probably a deadfic, but still worth reading for the first two books.

  * *[Deputy](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/deputy-internship-worm-au-au.483163/)* and its sequels *[Deputy Commander](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/deputy-commander-worm-au-sequel.518383/)* and *[Deputy Director](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/deputy-director-worm-au-sequel.581563/)* tells the story of a Taylor who never gets superpowers, joins the PRT as an intern, and proceeds to have adventures. Really fun; relies a bit much on OCs, but I deeply enjoyed the Piggot characterization. Recursive fanfic from *Internship*, which I am sorry to say I cannot really recommend; the *Deputy* saga is much better-written.

  * *[Ring-Maker](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/ring-maker-worm-lord-of-the-rings-alt-power.517894)* is the story of an alt-power Taylor: a Tinker who forges items out of the history of Middle-Earth. I don't actually know what to say about this, I like it so much; just read it.

  I recommend [The Daily Grind](https://royalroadl.com/fiction/15925/the-daily-grind/chapter/184920/chapter-001) a story about an IT guy finding an alternate dimension in his office that only opens for a few minutes a week (but has weird time stretching inside). Really well-written and competent characters that try to figure out what is going on and an interesting world that feels computer generated but landed in the uncanny valley.

  There are only 29 chapters so far, but the author is posting a new one every 3-4 days.

  [Splinters](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/splinters-worm.619954/): Worm fanfic, Taylor uses her multitasking power to specialize threads of awareness into roles/personas similar to [Crystal Society](http://crystal.raelifin.com/) or [Legion](https://brandonsanderson.com/books/legion/legion/).  Has Actress learning body language, Friendship and Hatred dedicated to making/maintaining friendships (bored) and keeping track of her enemies (overworked), etc.  List of major splinters [here](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/splinters-worm.619954/#post-44640817)

    Just to recommend a story that feels related: [Split](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/split-worm-fic.24539/): A story in which Taylor has the ability to copy the combined mind and power of other parahumans on touch. The story is heavily psychology-focused, with an emphasis on the internal conflicts Taylor has been the multiple minds and memory-sets she possesses, and does an excellent job exploring the psychology of Taylor's power and other psychology-based powers that come into play. Also has Taylor opening up to an actual psychologist and introduces a psychology through the story.

  A meta-reccomendation:

  I've recently discovered the app [Libby](https://meet.libbyapp.com/) which allows me to check out the works present at my local library as e-books. I've already gone through *Blade Runner* and went about halfway through a few other books I was interested in but ultimately didn't feel like finishing.

  The app doesn't work for every library's catalogue (only one of my two library cards functioned) but if it works for yours, it's an incredibly useful tool. It works on android, IOS, and Windows.
  ```

  - u/ShIxtan:
    ```
    If that doesn't work for your card, you might also try overdrive, which is a very similar service. Or hoopla, which one of my local libraries has, with a huge selection of comics and graphic novels
    ```

  I have preferences for scheming protagonist with ambitions and realistic depiction of politics. My recommendation list reflect that:

  [Living an Indoctrinated Dream](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10457949/1/Living-an-Indoctrinated-Dream) - one of the main antagonists in Mass Effect series, Illusive Man wakes up after his death before humanity first contact, and promptly gets to business of manipulating everybody in preparations for the Reapers. The best thing about this fic is that everything happens on truly galactic scale starting with carefully calculated batarian genocide to the recreation of Prothean Empire(sic!). It's also has best depiction of how various governments work and upward of 1mm words.


  [Mass Divergence](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12241700/1/Mass-Divergence)  - turns out author of "To the Stars" has another fic under different account - crossover of Mass Effect and "To the Stars".


  [Loyalty](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5316196/1/Loyalty) - Naruto fanfic about girl who was strongarmed into becoming a spy against her village. Fic contains lots of betrayal, moral doubts and other deliciousness.

  [Taking Sights](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4109686/1/Taking-Sights) (Evangelion fanfic)  -  magnificent bastard Gendo Ikari wakes up after Third Impact in past and discovers that his wife, for whom he literally burned the whole world, sacrificed herself to prevent all that he has done. So he sets out to save the world and take care of his kids in most underhanded and ruthless way possible. Fanfic is unfortunately dead but has about 150K words.

  [Thousand Shinji](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3946501/1/Thousand-Shinji) (Evangelion and Warhammer crossover, complete)  -  "Shinji is his father's son, and with a little mentoring from an unlikely source, he will learn the ways of plotting and scheming, along with a few other useful skills. Gendo is so screwed. And so is everyone else."
  ```

- u/xamueljones:
  ```
  [Keit-Ai!](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebOriginal/KeitAi) - an unusual romance where the boy and the girl reveals their deepest, darkest secrets to equip each other with the weapons needed to conquer the hearts of their alternate-version selves from their respective parallel dimensions.

  [The Maretian](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/396744/the-maretian) - a crossover between *My Little Ponies* and the book *The Martian* by Andy Weir. Don't read if you haven't read *The Martian* yet since there are heavy spoilers for the book's plot. It's a very well done plotline of ponies and humans juggling surviving together on the hostile planet, Mars, and handling a first-contact scenario.

  It's a sequel to [Changeling Space Program](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/327551/changeling-space-program), but that's only to cover how the ponies managed to develop space flight and isn't necessary reading for reading *The Maretian*. Great read with Queen Chrysalis as the protagonist who is hellbent on reaching the moon first to gain ever-lasting power and conquer Equestria.

  [Silver](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11575324/1/Silver) - a RWBY fanfic where Juane is the protagonist who came up with the audacious idea of creating weapons out of Aura. The story is about team JNPR rather than just Juane having major character development and comes up with novel ideas about how Aura works. A good amount is having Juane and others do a lot of figuring out the rules of Aura that is somewhat similar to the early chapters of HPMOR where Harry was testing the rules of magic. It's unrealistic how often they're right when a lot of hypothesis testing is usually failure rather than success.

  Hmmmm.....I use calibre library to catalog and store my digital books. This gives me the option to create and share a list of the books in my library. While it may seem useless, I have a library that is specifically for books I can download off the Internet and if I give the list to others, then other people can find all of the free books/stories I have chosen to download off the Internet. Would anyone be interested? If there is anyone else also uses calibre, I would be interested in other people's book catalog as well.

  Still kinda new to rational fics, for some reason I have always enjoyed when people fuck around with time. I enjoyed those aspects in MoL and HPMOR, any other recommended rat fics out there where messing with time is a crucial part of the story? I don't mind plot holes or stuff that would break the universe that much. I also read Everyone is a Returnee under the recommendation of someone from here in some thread a few weeks ago (thanks whoever you are!), and even though it isn't very rational (or at least not rationalist?) it still is within the ballpark of what I want/might enjoy.

    I liked Time Braid by ShaperV, although it's been a while since I've read it. A classic of the genre.

      I finished reading it a few days ago and it was pretty good! I really enjoyed it and pretty much finished it in like two days. The time loop was well done and very interesting, the whole thing about Sakura having different versions of herself in her mind was neat (kinda reminded me of Cristal Society/Legion). I don't know how much of it is canon since I never finished shippuden, but the whole thing about the demons and the gods was great and quite trippy.

      It was a bit too pornographic for my tastes at first, well not really but I guess since this was in the Naruto universe I didn't expect it to be so mature... you get what I mean. Eventually it grew on me and I started appreciating how honest it is, but yeah. Great fic nonetheless but it's a bit harder to recommend than something like Mother of Learning.

  Hm, not that much read this month.

  [The Elephant In The Brain](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28820444-the-elephant-in-the-brain) (non-fiction) was good, though at times the writing felt forced. Still, worth a read.

  [We have always lived in the castle](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/89724.We_Have_Always_Lived_in_the_Castle) I felt was very good, but probably not if you're looking for the 'rational' aspects. While the characters are very well crafted, they're... exaggerations? And the setting is far from rational, built clearly to faciliate the thought experiment. Call it a character study.

  Read [Under Heaven](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7139892-under-heaven) again, all /r/rational readers should read at least one Guy Gavriel Kay book and decide if that's their style :P

  Attempted [The War Of Undoing](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25328003-the-war-of-undoing) but DNF. Setting's somewhat interesting, but the prose is uninspired, and each character in the main trio is so frustratingly flawed it's difficult to cheer for them. May come back to this later.
