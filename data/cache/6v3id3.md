## [D] Monday General Rationality Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics!  Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world?  Have you:

* Seen something interesting on /r/science?
* Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
* Figured out how to become immortal?
* Constructed artificial general intelligence?
* Read a neat nonfiction book?
* Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?

  I just stumbled on this community, and it's basically something I didn't know I was looking for. I'm creating a game in my spare time with several aspects of rationalist fiction.

  First, a magic system that runs on an internal logic of the easy-to-learn difficult-to-master sort that the protagonists learn the 'rules' to as they progress.

  Second, no objective good or evil. I will not be making the character's moral decisions for them, and conflict is driven by the same things it is in the real world, with every faction seeing themselves as the 'good guy'. 

  Third, I'm trying to create internally-consistent but blue and orange moral codes for several NPC factions, so resources are available to those who are willing to take the time to 'crack the code'. 

  It sounds like the most appropriate time to discuss my issues is only on Worldbuilding Wednesdays, and not the rest of the week. Do I have that correct? Thanks!

    Yeah, discussing the details is probably best in the Wednesday thread. 

    If you haven't seen it already, [I wrote up a paper some time ago](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11QAh61C8gsL-5KbdIy5zx3IN6bv_E9UkHjwMLVQ7LHg/edit?usp=drivesdk) on how the "rational" moniker might apply to games, although I was more concerned with mechanics rather than story (which appears to be the rational focus of what you describe). But I dunno, might be useful for you.
    ```

    - u/Carduus_Benedictus:
      ```
      Oh, I'm certainly trying for rational mechanics in role, rules and balancing. I'm just stronger on the story end, and I'm going to probably need collaboration for the mechanics/ruleset both in scope and munchkin-prevention* (in the sense of preventing game-breaking early. I certainly want people to exploit the mechanics by the end of the game.)

    Fair warning: you're taking on a really, really, really huge logistical challenge here. (especially if you're doing this on free time)

    Making a conflict-driven story with several (I'm supposing you want more than two) factions that are compelling to the player and delivering it through gameplay is... um, actually pretty hard.

    So, um, I'm not going to give you advice you didn't ask on a project you didn't explain, but... generally speaking, try to read up on narrative-driven games ? (Extra Credits probably has more than a few videos that would interest you)

    And good luck!

  I just want to express my appreciation for what *My Hero Academia* did with Froppy two weeks ago.  I know /r/anime says she's just some rando writer's favorite, but she actually *is* an excellent budding hero.  What's her Quirk?  "Does whatever a frog can".  Why's she even here? Because she's serious, studious, ethical, and works well with others.

  Or in other words, instead of having some easily exploitable superpower, she's there because she has the personal qualities necessary to make *any* superpower useful.

  Meanwhile, they've also made the Captain Marvel/America-style brick-of-muscle hero into a compelling character on his own, who struggles to maintain the masquerade that superheroes really can maintain peace in a world where villains have superpowers too.  He's still trying his hardest to be the invincible man who saves the day with a smile, the Symbol of Peace, even while he's slowly dying.

    I'm not sure if this is a right thread to discuss this, but I don't care because I'm a fan of this show. I stopped watching after the tournament arc so I could binge the rest of the season when it ends, so I'm happy to hear that she gets more development. All-Might has been my favorite character from the beginning since I personally relate to his struggle to live up to his own standards.

    I feel like building up a hero as Superman and then revealing its a facade has become a cliche in its own right, but HeroAca pulled it off for me by showing he really is trying to be the most morally righteous person he can be in the hope that it will inspire others to do the same. He wants to help others more than anything and will risk his life to do so even if it's not always the "smart" decision.

    HeroAca is a show that deeply understands the fundamental themes of the American superhero genre, reinterpreted with the story structure and style of shonen anime, and delivers on the emotional appeal of those stories. I love that the show has become as popular as it has among kids since it teaches great lessons using the superhero school as a metaphor for the questions kids face when approaching adulthood.

    We see examples of kids who were never given the chance to prove their abilities because of flawed social institutions and prejudices, families pressuring their children and kids pressuring themselves into professional success, the toxic masculinity that pervades the culture of success and competition, and Deku's arc is all about showing how hard his goals really are to achieve so he needs to work smarter than everyone else only to still face setbacks.

      >Deku's arc is all about showing how hard his goals really are to achieve so he needs to work smarter than everyone else only to still face setbacks.

      I sooooo appreciate this.  I also really appreciate that All Might chose Deku *because he counteracted the Bystander Effect*.  Other people stood there.  Deku went in swinging despite being Quirkless.
      ```

      - u/trekie140:
        ```
        And he did it after being told he didn't have what it takes to be a hero by his idol. Even in that state, knowing all the reasons he had not to do something and having basically no plan or, he ran towards the danger in an attempt to help someone who hated him because he had to do *something*. Seeing him do that, in a world where many heroes value their status as celebrities or fighters more than helping people, pulled All-Might out of his depression to take action despite how much it would risk to him. That his speech to Deku afterward cemented their relationship as my favorite part of the series.

        Now, the scene isn't flawless. Deku did act rashly and took unnecessary risks without a proper plan, which the show kind of glosses over in favor. However, it makes up for it later by focusing on Deku's cleverness in every other dangerous situation, and it doesn't matter that much anyway because the emotions of the moment are incredibly built up to and paid off. That's HeroAca in a nutshell, it delivers on the emotional satisfaction of its story so well that I only notice the wrinkles in the writing because I'm paying really close attention and thinking about the story so much.

            Planning and combat skills can be learned, personality can't.

            It takes a special kind of person to see an utterly hopeless situation, recognize that it is utterly hopeless, recognize that they have absolutely no obligation to help, and yet proceed to sacrifice their life to try anyway, in hopes of helping just the slightest bit.

    What studys are you using to form your opinion on red meat and poor health correlation?
    ```

    - u/Dwood15:
      ```
      I'll admit, my opinion was formed before I found any studies that were produced. In fact, I'm not talking explicitly about red meat necessarily and health correlation, but rather, my anecdotal experiences regarding cattle.

      The strongest point in favor of these replacements, is the sheer amount of cholesterol in the modern first world human diet. By creating a Burger replacement, I believe that reducing Cholesterol will help humans across the board.

      As for disease vectors: Cattle that graze often require artificial water sources. Every time I've passed a water source for cattle in the wild, it was a massive breeding ground for mosquitos.

      Other health benefits of getting rid of beef cattle would come with the freeing of land for more public use, and less waste as well as less methane/greenhouse gases in the air.

    >  Chicken is going to be a massively difficult industry to disrupt until we can get lab-grown Egg White and Egg yolk to become things.

    Just a quick note: egg-laying and meat-producing chickens are practically unrelated industries, the same as beef cows and dairy cows.  The animals have a common ancestor decades in the past, and that's about it for links between the industries.  

    Completely supplanting the meat-chicken industry would have minimal effects on the egg industry (same with dairy/beef).

  I am thinking really hard about whether or not my own story is [RTS] or [RT]. I am not even sure whether or not it is rational enough for this place.

  Anyway, it's called [the Dao of Magic](http://royalroadl.com/fiction/11397/the-dao-of-magic).

  I started writing it as a xianxia deconstruction and try very hard to have a certain amount of logical science in a universe filled with magic, mysticism and cultivators.

  Should I post new chapters here? Maybe make posts once I have five or ten chapters written?
  ```

  - u/tonytwostep:

    This sounds interesting, I would probably give it a read.

    However, I really like [Wildbow's advice for starting new webserials](https://wildbow.wordpress.com/2017/05/22/thoughts-on-writing-serials/) - which is that you should write a backlog of 12-15 chapters before starting to actually post. It's helpful for you as a writer (confirms you have a solid concept, gives you a sense of how long each chapter will take to write and thus what kind of posting schedule you can keep, etc), but also for readers (generally leads to a more solid intro, because you can edit those chapters as a group). Plus, if real life starts to intrude, you can skip a few posts' worth of writing, because you've got that buffer of chapters to fall back on.
    ```

    - u/WeirdWhirl:
      ```
      Uuuuhm, I posted the 78th chapter today?  
      I average 2.5k words per chapter, so there are around 200k words ready for you to read...  
      Thanks for the advice though! :)

        Ah cool! Sorry, when you said
        > Maybe make posts once I have five or ten chapters written?

        I interpreted that as you still hadn't written the first 5-10 chapters yet. But clearly you're well beyond that :)

        I'll check it out!

    The bunny / dragon missile about killed me from lack of oxygen I was laughing so hard.

    Occasionally the silliness gets a bit much, but that's really a personal preference thing which is *really* subjective. I knew what I was getting into when I started reading it.

    Keep up the good work.

  So, *The Sequences*. I tried to read them in 2012 but didn't work very well for me. I've heard that being exposed to the wider rationalist community more or less makes some parts of them go the way of *John Carter of Mars* or *Seinfeld*: people first exposed to them now are somewhat bored by them because they're cliche, but they invented the cliches so in their time they were groundbreaking.

  So, is this sort of concept applicable to the sequences? And/or is there something else that has been released in the meantime that does the sequences but better? 

  Basically: let's assume I'm willing to read *one* Rationalist Bible type document. Should that document be The Sequences or something else?
  ```

  - u/PeridexisErrant:
    ```
    You should read *[Rationality: from AI to Zombies](https://intelligence.org/rationality-ai-zombies/)*.  It's literally the Sequences, but edited and rearranged to make sense as a book rather than a blog.

    It's hard to pin down cliché, but they formed the community and constitute something like assumed knowledge - most people disagree with some parts, but the sequences are still the thing you disagree *with*.

  TL;DR: House reapportionment as political panacea, discuss.

  A question that's been largely forgotten as his actual presidency proceeds is how Trump got elected. He lost the popular vote by a large margin, but won the electoral vote, the vote that matters, on the strength of mostly rural states. Now, at first glance this looks like a problem with the electoral college, favoring rural states. But why does it favor rural states?

  Each state gets electoral votes equal to their number of senators and representatives. So what varies the number of electoral votes is the number of house seats each state has. The number of house seats for each state is prescribed by the constitution to be not less than 30,000 people per representative, as counted by the census every ten years. They specified a minimum population under the premise that each state would want to maximize their number of representatives, and would try to do so at each census.

  But the last House reapportionment was in 1911. Not only has the population grown somewhat since then, the population distribution has shifted. Cities are bigger and denser, farming takes fewer people for greater output.

  So, I say, let's be constitutional originalists. Let's have a House reapportionment that reflects the actual population of these United States. What would this look like?

  First, with a population of more than 300 million, the new House has over ten thousand seats. Let's build them a grand new hall designed primarily to invoke the overview effect astronauts and cosmonauts experience. What would it mean to have so many representatives? It would mean smaller districts, which have several benefits: your representative is both more reliant on each individual constituent and less worthwhile to buy. Each one would have less personal power, and niche or even protest candidates would be more viable.

  Second, smaller districts are harder to gerrymander. You can't have a district that snakes all around a city and gets all the poor, mostly black or hispanic areas if those areas are several dozen districts worth of people, and slices that group rural areas in with cities would have to get really thin and obvious. This massive redistricting effort would also be a good opportunity to try algorithmic redistricting and other anti gerrymandering districting schemes.

  Third, to bring it back to the opening question, if representatives were proportional to population, electoral votes would be too, and the electoral vote would naturally more closely match the popular vote.

  By this one, admittedly radical and complicated change, we fix several apparently unrelated problems.

  This is a well written political essay. It starts by looking at the rationale behind political conservatism based on failures in "rational design of social order", the history behind the move to neoliberlism and why most western countries are moving away from it. Then it transitions into reviewing a universal basic income in light of machine intelligence and compares that system with "social investment".

  > Some people in National [the centre-right party of NZ] gloat about the prospect of social investment rendering their adversaries on the traditional left obsolete.'If we can deliver a more effective welfare system for less money, why would anyone vote for them?’ A fair question, but here’s another one: what does it even mean to be a right-wing party or a conservative politician in a society in which the state can make better decisions about price or resource allocation than the individual or the market? What kind of economy do we end up with once the state no longer needs to simplify its model of the world, and its maps can be as complex as the territory?

    This sounds to me like a world in which the government has perfect knowledge of the economic apparatus. This is not the case right now, and if it were we would be living in a society two steps away from being a horrifying dystopia.
    ```

    - u/Gigapode:
      ```
      Yeah I agree that its not the case. That point in the essay comes relatively soon after discussing how the universal basic income might work in an era where machine intelligence has taken over the "white collar" jobs but that we aren't at that point yet.

      So it seems a little inconsistent that the social investment section doesn't make that same point - we don't have those maps yet. Though there is probably a lot more market-related data than welfare data.
      ```

      - u/ShannonAlther:
        ```
        Exactly! And, forgive me if I'm being a little reductionist, but Mclauchlan seems to be saying that if we didn't need Conservative policy, we wouldn't need Conservative politicians. It's almost tautologically true. Having said that, I liked this essay; very interesting.
        ```
