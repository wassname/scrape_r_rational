    I like how on the /r/PracticalGuideToEvil the top comment is about being horrified by the same chain of logic, and here it's just a gag. A "great joy in life" indeed.

  A good chapter. It was a good reminder of what Praesian court *is*. The twins were there to dig for information and they failed. It felt properly dangerous, which is something we've heard and not seen, which is nice but unnecessary. It also showed us that Masego doesn't need constant reminders of who his friends are to stay loyal to Callow.

  He's rebelling, which feels good. A wedge has formed between him and his fathers, which, in theory, can't be resolved. I guessed months ago that warlock would die or be AWOL, and I thought that, coupled with his comfortable life in the Observatory, would be enough to keep his loyalty. Turns out he just chose his own way.

  I'm happy for Masego this chapter. He's standing up for what he thinks is right, he even (or tried to, bless his cotton socks) put a lawful spin on boiling someone to death by justifying it with Treason laws.

  I like the differences between his magic and his father's in play. Masego saw everything as it was and decided that it was his right to punish those who wronged him; the epitome of Praesian "Might makes Right" culture. His father's contingencies is a show of power. No application of effort, just a challenge for anyone to beat his passive defences.

  I can't wait for papa Heirophant to come home to Callow with the shackles off and I hope Cat buys him a barrel of monkeys.

  The interludes are always the best part of the series.

  Masgeo's viewpoint is a fun mixture of amusing and horrifying, and the dynamic between him and his fathers should be interesting to see play out. Prase is always a cool part of the setting to see. And however this Praes-Ashur conflict plays out is going to be critical for Callow's future.

  There was also a bit of musings about magic, which on one hand is kind of interesting in its own right, but I've also just about given up on ever getting enough of the magic systems explained to have a grip on what can and can't be done within it.

  I think Tikoloshe has already figured out why Masego is angry.
  ```

  - u/Menolith:
    ```
    I think both of them have.

    >“He’s been to Keter,” Tikoloshe murmured.

    >“That matter is long buried,” Wekesa frowned.

    >“The Dead King-”

    I doubt that the "matter" here is unrelated.

  I love Masego interludes. They're so charming.

    nothing will beat the extra chapter

    ...even if this is sometimes a close call
    ```

  - u/Agnoman:
    ```
    I mean, if we're going to define charming as deciding to boil two strangers alive for a petty insult, immediately forgetting it's happening until their steaming blood evaporates from their eyes, and then moving on to being dissapointed that they didn't quite how he wanted, then yeah. Charming.

    He's most certainly a fun sort of monster though, in how he's so stunted and childlike in some ways yet absurdly competent in others.
    ```

    - u/Cariyaga:
      ```
      I mean, that's how *I* define charming, dunno about you. :P

  So, Warlock either 1) Does not know Amadeus is dead, 2) Knows but is in denial about it, or 3) Knows he survived.
  ```

  - u/BaggyOz:
    ```
    Or it hasn't happened yet.
    ```

    - u/hailcapital:
      ```
      Good point. I've been assuming non-Extra Chapter Interludes are in chronological order, but that might be mistaken.
      ```

      - u/sparr:
        ```
        I hate when a new interlude and a new chapter post at the same time and I don't know which one to read first :/
        ```

  - u/letouriste1:
    ```
    of course he survived. the only alternative would be the fight is still ongoing xD (which would be a big headache for procer given how needed these heroes are in the north)
    ```

    - u/hailcapital:
      ```
      I think 2 is actually the biggest probability, tbh. Every time we've had a Warlock interlude it's touched on his belief that basically no matter what this will all go back to the Post-Conquest normal they established- Catherine will be killed w/ out permanently alienating Amadeus, Amadeus and Malicia will reconcile, etc.

      Maybe I'm reading too much into a couple of lines, but I would not be surprised if this is meant to allude to a sort of mental failure mode he's fallen into.
      ```

  - u/TaltosDreamer:
    ```
    I think Amadeus dying is happening pretty much around the time of the interlude, so Warlock is about to have a rage-induced distraction from why Heirophant is angry.
    ```

    - u/RynnisOne:
      ```
      **Black dies**

      *Cat takes his body, rips out soul, binds to cloak*

      "Dad... I'd like you to say hello to an old frenemy of mine..."

  > “It is common practice among the lower classes of Praes, who lack surnames, to name their children after themselves in the hopes of confounding any devils coming to collect on debts.” 

  Oh come on, that has to be a gross misunderstanding of a Praesi tradition by a biased foreigner, right? I'm pretty sure Praesi lower classes aren't *that* sociopathic.
