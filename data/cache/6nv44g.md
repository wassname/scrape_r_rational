  Oh man I totally forgot to add this little snippet to the author's notes - I originally wanted to show much more of Tobirama's writing on combat tactics, but it didn't work out timing-wise:


  >**Tobirama’s Creed**

  >Hone these things that you will need:  
  >Knowledge, Power, Stamina, Speed.  
  >Beware thine trappings of conceit;  
  >Be you in melee outmatched – retreat!  

  >Hurl your tag to raise their shield  
  >Pierce the guard that it would yield  
  >Sense the foe beneath the field  
  >Chakra flared is truth revealed  

  >One fact surely cannot fail  
  >Forbidden power; widow’s wail  
  >Seek out wisdom, break the veil  
  >Only thus may you prevail.  

  And then, having gotten his poetry aspirations out of his system, the entire rest of his dissertation would consist of clearcut instructions written in such a simple way that a five year old could understand it, because Tobirama is not an idiot.

  Hm. None of that special tenth question nonsense huh. Would you be willing to tell me your reasoning behind removing it, just for the kicks?
  ```

  - u/Sophronius:
    ```
    Two reasons. 

    Firstly, it makes no sense to include it from the proctors' perspective. Originally I was going to reinvent the entire test, but in the end I concluded that everything up to the tenth question was actually already a very clever way of testing a ninja's intelligence gathering abilities. The tenth question however makes everything up to that point completely irrelevant, allowing a student like Naruto to pass without answering a single question in what's basically the academic equivalent of catching the Snitch.

    Secondly, everybody has already read this scene a hundred times already, so there really is no point in covering that bit again. The interesting part, for me, was Naruto's interaction with Ibiki (which is part of the main plot as Ibiki is one of Naruto's main suspects for the Kyubi's attack on the Village) and so I wanted to focus on that.

  Now that Kiba has literally called Naruto out as a dumbass, I can't wait for Naruto to prove him wrong in some sufficiently epic way. I suspect that any fight Naruto gets into in these exams is going to involve a lot less accidental farting, and lot more tactics :)

    > less accidental farting, and lot more tactics

    so what you're saying is, more *intentional* farting
    ```

    - u/Sophronius:
      ```
      >Kiba doubled over, coughing and wheezing like a cat with a hairball, the stench in the air seeming almost emblematic of the foulness of defeat. “Lu- lucky…”

      >“Luck has nothing to do with.” The orange figure loomed over him, victorious as a blazing sun. That vain and foolish grin, which had once been an object of mockery to lesser men, now filled him with a bleak despair. “Think back, Kiba-kun. Think back on what you know, and speak the truth that lies plain before you.”  

      >“No… it’s impossible.” Kiba shook his head, seeking vainly to disperse the cloistering gas that clung to him like death’s own shroud. “But then, the baked beans, the spoiled milk…” It was inconceivable, and yet... “It can’t be!”

      >“That’s right,” said Naruto. “I planned that fart *right from the start.*”
      ```

      Tactics.
