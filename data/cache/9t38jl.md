  > All are emulations of human minds created by the DM and running on the DM's computational substrate

  While this is true, up to this point we've been assuming the DM is computing the brain states of each party member the same way that he does Joon's, ie, they have qualia.

  The implication of calling Vervain a DMPC is that Vervain wasn't even an emulation with his own thoughts and feelings, just Dice Guy self-inserting himself into Aerb and acting out a character.

    Minor nitpick: distinct qualia. A DMPC would have their own qualia, only they wouldn't be separated from the DM's.

  Following that chain of logic, all NPCs are also DMPCs, which doesn't quite mesh with what (my understanding) a DMPC is.  
  In a tabletop RPG, one of the differences between an NPC and a DMPC is how the character interacts with the party. While an NPC might have a fleshed out background, things they want to accomplish, goals, desires, etc, the DM roleplays as that NPC to the benefit of the verisimilitude of the world. As a player, you expect the people you interact with to behave like people, with their own lives, and stories, and motivation to behave the way they do. 

  A DMPC is different. Sometimes they are a character the DM is particularly attached to (either a character they really wanted to play in a game themselves, or a theory crafted something or other that they never got to play), and the DM favors this NPC with lots of "screen time", special magical powers, or other "look at me!" types of stuff.  
  Other times, the DMPC play out an in-game reason for the players to follow a particular path, allowing the DM to subtly guide the players down routes they might otherwise not choose to go down.

   The DMPC has an intelligence guiding its motivations outside of a simple backstory or a quest to give. It serves as an Avatar of the DM's will in the world, influencing the only characters whose decisions the DM doesn't normally get to make. 

  The players.

  Since arriving in Aerb, Juniper has seen and dealt with a lot of strange things and to "immediately dismiss the concept of a DMPC" and immediately conclude Arthur was mad doesn't really seem consistent with his character.  


  Just my two cents. :)

  I think it's still a meaningful concept. It's the difference between the DM creating a person and letting them run independently from that start point, and the DM controlling every action of a person. Yes, the DM still controls the start point of that person, and could shape that person to lead to the outcomes they desire, but there's a difference between someone being an independent being with their own thoughts, motivations etc, and them just being a sockpuppet

  A quote I don't think anyone has looked at, from the [Amaryllis POV Chapter.](https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/31229865)

  >he said a small prayer to each of the five gods, and then a final, sixth prayer to the Dungeon Master that Juniper believed was the one true god of Aerb. Prayers to the gods had their own specific structures to them, with motifs and iconographies that the pious were expected to adhere to, even if prayer itself was next to useless. The prayer to the Dungeon Master took some thought, because no standards existed for praying to what was only a theoretical deity.

  >Dungeon Master, if I must be on your railroad, let me ride the train with good humor. If I must roll the dice, let it be known that I would not object to you fudging. Place a dungeon before me, and I will delve it. Place a dragon before me, and I will slay it. **I am, above all else, your player.**

  I think there is a level of difference between what Joon considers to be a DMPC, ie someone directly controlled by the DM, and the emulation of a person. Presumably, Vervain wasn't a full person like basically everyone else probably is, more of a vessel for the DM to act through to get Arthur off his ass. It's the level of direct interference that the DM has on their minds and decision-making. There is a lot on Aerb that the DM doesn't seem to directly interfere with after it gets going, even if he's running the software, for reasons of fair play.

  From Arthur's point of view he wakes up in a game that is completely made from Juniper's ideas. Who do you think Arthur would think the DM is? He probably said to Vervain so many times "Fuck you, Joon. Let me out of this game! At least admit to me you're fucking with me." until he lost it and killed him.  


  When Joon finds Arthur, Arthur is not going to be happy to see him.

    Vervain would likely have explicitly said "I'm not Juniper", I think. In fact, there's evidence that either Vervain said that, or Arthur didn't believe that in the first place:

    >When Joon finds Arthur, Arthur is not going to be happy to see him.

    Arthur left Juniper a message, acknowledging that the ideas line up with Juniper's own.

    This message was *not* filled with cussing at Juniper.

  > All the party members are DMPCs. 

  No, that's... not really true. The difference here is that the simulated NPCs are presumed to be simulated in earnest, with the DM not really micromanaging their behaviour. That's what simulation is *all about*, to take most of the labour off the DM. It's more or less an equal playing field with the DM. A truly simulated NPC can surprise Joon just as well they can surprise the DM (if DM is human).

  The DMPC is exactly not that. It's a character that is puppeteered by the DM if not all the time, then most of the time when Joon meaningfully interacts with them. 

  We don't know why Arthur declared Vervain a DMPC. Maybe he had good evidence (not equals 'Arthur was right'), or maybe he was nuts. 

  Joon can dismiss any musings about DMPCs simply as something he can't really do anything about. But dismissing the idea as a whole is an obvious mistake.

  Even assuming Aerb is some sort of simulation, PCs, NPCs, and DMPCs are entirely different things. The player character (Jun or Arthur) are actors controlled by the player; the NPCs are controlled by the DM, but are not actors themselves, they can be said to have no free will or perfect knowledge; the DMPC is an actor controlled by the DM. The DM has a perfect or near perfect knowledge of the simulation. If a PC knew every horrific thing that the party would encounter throughout a dungeon, and the perfect solution to any problem encountered, the only moral choice, or logical choice would be to inform the PCs, and even the NPCs. Vervain did none of those things, and Arthur suffered terribly. 


  I'm not certain of Arthur's contact with the DM but if he believed  that Vervain was the voice of god, such as it was, he reacted no differently than Jun, or perhaps even more reasonably since vervain was a companion and friend which had been guiding him into what can only be described as a horrific life. Pretty much the first thing Jun did to the DM was beat him to death. Imagine if it turned out that Grak or Amryillis or Fenn knew everything that would result of Jun's choices, and just let it happen.

  Even if we as readers can imagine the concept doesn't *need* to have meaning from the actual DM's point of view, Joon has evidence that *Arthur belives* it has meaning to the DM, and the interactions Joon *has* had with the DM support or at least don't contradict the premise that the DM *does* think in those terms. So it's as true as anything else in the game world, really, and there's no downside to thinking the implications all the way through before dismissing the conflict *if and when* that is the proper response.

  The snide answer is 'because Dice Guy programmed him to'.  Like, Juniper is no realer or less real than the rest of the crew.
