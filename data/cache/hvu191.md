## Rational Fic Movies and Television Shows?

### Post:

Not sure if this is the right place for this: I was re-watching Breaking Bad for the first time since doing a deeper dive into Rationality and RationalFic, and think Walt is a Rationalist or, at the very least approaching being a Rationalist.

&#x200B;

Which other TV/Film properties do you think feature Rationalist characters, specifically like, non-animated ones (not that I dislike animation, but it being live-action does a little more to ground it in "the possible").

  There was a tv show called Day Break with Taye Diggs which only lasted one season which was pretty good. I think it was a little ahead of its time, actually, in how much it expected the viewers to keep track of and the ratings quickly plummeted because of it.

  It's a time loop show about a cop who gets stuck in a Very Bad Day where he's framed for a murder by a powerful conspiracy and, to make things worse, the injuries transfer loop to loop so if he dies, he dies. The protag is fairly rational about the whole thing -  for example, he cottons on to being in a time loop, like, ten minutes into Day 2 and instead of wasting time on shock or denial he instantly jumps into exploit his new advantage and trying to change things.

  The season finale wraps up reasonably well and doesn't feel unfinished. Give it a go.

    It felt unfinished and rushed to me.  Loved that show.

    Thanks, I'll check it out!

  Abed from Community.

  His personality revolves around self-awareness and deconstruction, and apart from the fact that he uses his powers to live in references, he's a pretty good example of rationalist characters in TV.

  [Even the TVTropes page on Rational Fiction mentions him.](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RationalFic)

  Edit:  As was pointed out below, this is very much not a serious show in the slightest.  In fact, it could be said that its self-awareness of real-world tropes allows it to *really* play around with concept humour, and the rationalist aspect is a by-product of that self-awareness and general deconstructive humour.

    I think this needs the clarification that Community is a comedy sitcom and it's not really focused on intelligent characters or advanced reasoning. It makes fun of tropes, especially with Abed, and that leads to dialogue this community would enjoy, but Community is very much not rational (merely fucking great).

    Ooh, this is a good one. Hadn't thought about that, but yeah, for sure.

    There's an episode in the final season where he exploits flashbacks to save "the gang" that feels particularly Rationalist. Reminds me of this HPMOR quote:

    > "You couldn't change history. But you could get it right to start with. Do something differently the first time around."

  I do not think a rationalist Movie/Show is really possible, because it would have no space to explain the protagonist's reasoning, without literally having him a fit of Narrator's Monologue.   


  The closest thing to a rationalist movie I can think of is **Shawshank Redemption**. The protag is an immensely rational and focused person whos actions are almost always well thought out, he only fails when he is working with insufficient information. It also has a subtle progression theme worked in.  


  in **Watchmen,** Veidt is also a rationalist, albeit a villainous one (or is he??).  


  **Prison Break** at least attempted to portray the main protag as a careful rationalist, but it eroded with each season.  


  All the time-loop movies (**Groundhog Day, Butterfly Effect, Triangle, Primer** etc) at least attempt to show what a protag who wants to be a rationalist about time travel, but fails, would be like.  


  Cast Away has shades of rationality once the protag is stranded on the island. In fact, I would say that in all fiction, time-travel stories and robinsonades show rationality best. Time travel removes the issue of insuficient information, while a robinsonade removes the issue of pesky human interactions, leaving the protag to tackle practical problems rationally.

  I think that if you take Walt as a rationalist character (rather than as a self-justifying paragon of toxic masculinity mixed with the sunk cost fallacy) you could easily take most characters from most TV shows as rationalists. A:tLA's Azula is more rationalist than Walt is, as is Iroh; BtVS's Anya is ten times the rationalist than Walt.
  ```

    I mean, Walt's flaws are not mutually exclusive of being a rationalist. He's absolutely a villain. He absolutely has biases which a perfect Bayesian would do more to account for, but that doesn't mean he's not a Reasonable Representation of a Rationalist Fictional Character. 

    &#x200B;

    Additionally, there's a reason that I disqualified animation – Cartoons don't have the same restrictions that live action television does, and you can kind of "retrofit" the rules of the world to not undo your characters' rationality if needed which means they're more gods than rationalists... Maybe that's not the case with ATLA, but it certainly is a possibility. 

    &#x200B;

    I certainly don't think that "most characters from most TV shows" can be taken as rationalists, and it seems like your disdain for Walt as a character is clouding your ability to judge .

    &#x200B;

    I also don't really think a non-POV character \*\*can\*\* be a rationalist. Azula sets some traps and like, does strategy a time or two, but you don't fully see her process. Having predictable opponents doesn't make \*\*you\*\* a rationalist. Iroh, you could make more of a case for, but, again, it's tough to see all of his plots laid bare, because he's not the POV.

    &#x200B;

    I didn't watch Buffy, and I'm not super-interested in doing a deep dive into a tertiary character to evaluate their strengths as a rationalist.

    &#x200B;

    To me, Ender Wiggin is a rationalist, and Walter White is a rationalist, because they show their work (to the audience, if not to another character), and if you had a suitable understanding of chemistry/military strategy, you could potentially deduce what they would do to get themselves out of a complicated scenario where you knew the variables.

    &#x200B;

    Walt isn't a "good guy" or a "hero" he's not a feminist –– I mean, straight up \*he's\* the villain in the series, but I don't think that makes him not a rationalist.

      That's... not a definition of rationalist that makes any sense to me, I guess. To me, the three defining qualities of a rationalist character (as opposed to a rationalist work) are:

      - The character self-reflects and at least attempts to perceive their own internal reasoning (which Walter White catastrophically fails at, constantly)
      - The character makes a best effort to treat other people as agents with their own rules, rather than projecting the character's own rules onto those others (likewise)
      - The character applies a deliberate strategy towards getting what they want, refining it in both failure and success. This strategy should probably be goal-tools-process-cost or something equivalent (What do I want, what tools do I have, how can I get from here to there, and what will it cost me) (as above, White fails at it).

      The fact that a character shows their work isn't that relevant to being a rationalist character, to me. It's what their work consists of, and what lines their deductions follow.
