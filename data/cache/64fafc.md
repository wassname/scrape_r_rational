  Nobody mentioning the revelation mention?

    Good catch (Deiseach in the comments also got it)

  That fucking Tom Swifty... wow. Just... wow.

    Where in this chapter was there a Tom Swifty?

  I think it's kind of funny that there's a sail for a placebomancer and they've been sailing all that time without all the sails even though any placebomancer could tell you that they're not going to catch God unless they have all the sails working.
  ```

  - u/Fredlage:
    ```
    I'm pretty sure they all knew that, which is why they immediately offered Ana a job when they thought she could work the yellow sail. Basically they were going around hoping to find the people capable of working the sails eventually.
    ```

  - u/zhanyin:
    ```
    Also, they're selling what they have, which is the ability to seek. It does say they were pretty mentally unprepared for this to go anywhere.

  >Something opened in Ana’s mind. New memories. Knowledge she shouldn’t have. A deep loss.

  Given that the knowledge clearly came from kabbalistic marriage to Erica, this seems to imply that Erica is dead? I can't see what else "a deep loss" could mean, but it also seems very odd for Erica to be dead, given that her last on screen moment was a moment of victory
  ```

  - u/MugaSofer:
    ```
    Well ... kind of. It ended "as the flames closed in around them."
    ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    > A deep loss.

    She's getting information through the chain from Sohu, who has just watch her angelic mentor get nuked
    ```

    - u/CeruleanTresses:
      ```
      The information Ana received was that Malia is Thamiel's daughter and that Mark's opal amulet bears her blood. We don't have a reason to think that Sohu knows Malia's true parentage, and Sohu didn't arrive at the dress rehearsal until after Dylan revealed that he intended to give everyone amulets bearing Malia's blood.

      However, we saw Erica learn both of those critical pieces of information. It's also implied that Ana would be crying if she had time for it, which suggests that she's feeling a personal loss, not Sohu's loss by proxy. 

      Given all of this, I think it makes the most sense to conclude that Ana got the information from Erica and that Erica is, in fact, dead. This is consistent with Erica stabbing Malia "as the flames closed in around them." Her victory was framed as a self-sacrificial one.
      ```

    - u/NoYouTryAnother:
      ```
      Just as importantly 
      >She thought with all her strength, and with strength beyond her own. She felt oppressed by a terrible cleverness and a wild rebellion. Finally she came to a decision.

      Strength beyond her own, terrible cunning, wild rebellion. Whose are these? I'd suspect Sohu for Strength and Dylan for Cunning (Erica for Rebellion?) but Dylan's dead.
      ```

      - u/CeruleanTresses:
        ```
        The main guy (Aaron?) is pretty clever with his kabbalistic shenanigans.
        ```

        - u/696e6372656469626c65:
          ```
          I'm not sure if you're making a joke about Aaron's lack of memorability, or if you've somehow genuinely forgotten his name.
          ```

          - u/CeruleanTresses:
            ```
            I have trouble with his name because he doesn't use it to refer to himself, and also he's one of the least interesting characters to me. So, both, but mostly the first thing. Not enough repetition to stick in my memory.
            ```

- u/Jmdlh123:
  ```
  So, any guesses as to what Ana figured out at the end?
  ```

  - u/oliwhail:
    ```
    Whatever it is, you can bet it'll be some kind of fucking pun.
    ```

    - u/arlindohall:
      ```
      Holy crap. If this whole story was actually just a set up for an epic whale pun... Actually that's the most likely scenario and I think I would be okay with it.
      ```

      - u/KarlitoHomes:
        ```
        I'm still hoping for some kind of [jellyfish](http://unsongbook.com/interlude-ח-war-and-peace/) to make an appearance.
        ```

      - u/wren42:
        ```
        oh.

        right.

        I mean that's what he and ana have been playing at all along, isn't it?  That's the only way it can really end.
        ```

        - u/arlindohall:
          ```
          It's been the only option all along, we just didn't notice until it was too late to turn back; now we have no choice but to barrel full speed into the abyss. Accept the whale puns, you know it's what you wanted.
          ```

          - u/wren42:
            ```
            the secret purpose to evil and the final answer to theodicy is that God is a cheesy dweeb in a bad suit giving the world finger guns as they march into hell, as Thamiel winks and says "Sure gonna be a lot of WHALING up in here!" Cue laugh track, curtain, and credits.
            ```

            - u/None:
              ```
              Ha, this is now my official canon, I don't think Scott could come up with anything better.
              ```

  - u/VorpalAuroch:
    ```
    >“No buts. If you can fathom the mind of the Comet King, you can talk to him as an equal. Until then…”

    > ...

    >“Canst thou draw out Leviathan with a fishhook?” asked Ana, that night at the dinner table. “Or his tongue with a cord which thou lettest down? Canst thou put a hook into his nose? Or bore his jaw through with a thorn?”

    >...

    >“What I think my esteemed cousin meant,” Ana had said, “is that God argues here that we’re too weak and ignorant to be worthy to know these things. But then the question becomes – exactly how smart do we have to be to deserve an answer? Now that we can, as Bill puts it, send lightning through the sky, now that we can capture whales and make them do tricks for us, does that mean we have a right to ask God for an explanation? Discuss!”

    I think she is combining these to the obvious conclusion: *Now* she has captured Leviathan with a fishhook (it was her actions directly that did it) and so she has earned the right to ask him for an explanation.

      I'm going to place a side bet here that the Captain is not the Comet King, the Captain is God.

      - u/VorpalAuroch:
        ```
        That does seem likely, given the Panama canal events.
        ```

        - u/awesomeideas:
          ```
          I agree, and this is what I thought was going to happen. It'd be funnier if the dog were just electricity from the alternator, though:

          Sinusoidal Alternating Current -> SINAC ~ CANIS -> Dog
          ```

  - u/Ninmesara:
    ```
    She has caught the Leviathan, and now she is worthy of talking to Metatron. Metatron is the Captain. I don't know if this is true (even though I think it is), but it's clearly what she thinks.
    ```

    - u/crivtox:
      ```
      In Panama after the Kablablistic inversion the dog was an omen , so  nemo is God.
      ```

      - u/Frommerman:
        ```
        That must be correct.
        ```

    - u/MugaSofer:
      ```
      Makes sense. Everyone knows Metatron is constantly sailing the Earth in the world's fastest ship.
      ```

  - u/monkyyy0:
    ```
    Yes

    "There isn't a solution to the problem of evil."
    ```

    - u/fljared:
      ```
      I'm not sure that makes sense; If there is a God who created the universe, He must have a reason to have created evil. Either he is all good and there's a secret reason for evil, or he is not all good, and evil exists just because.
      ```

      - u/monkyyy0:
        ```
        God may not understand evil is bad.

        In this universe the smartest person is emotionally broken, and the strongest is somehow competely useless.
        ```

        - u/fljared:
          ```
          Well, then I'd see he isn't omnibenovolent.
          ```

  You, Mr Scott, have a way with evocative imagery thats just... blowing me out of the water.

  ```

- u/monkyyy0:
  ```
  The moral of the story: complaining in the face of everyone fancy vision of the world fixes your problems.

  You are a stubborn child telling the fucking universe how it ought to work, the solution is to cry out louder and louder until it gives.

  The captain is about to get a earful of why the problem of evil is still a problem that needs to be fixed, damning the consequences and fancy reasons.
  ```

  - u/wren42:
    ```
    Is this some kind of veiled dig at millennials?
