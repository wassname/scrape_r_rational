## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  Any recommendations for crossover fanfictions that intelligently explores the results of two well-established magic/paranormal systems interacting with each other? Preferably one where rules of each setting are well defined and obeyed, whether that's magic, nanites, chakra or midichlorians.

  A prime example would be [Harry Potter and the Natural 20](https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20) which explores what happens when DnD 3.5e's magic system meets the Harry Potter universe.

    The following comment is a portion from an [old comment of mine](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/frsf6r/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/fm0j4z5/) with 4 additions and minor modifications:

    * [An Imago of Rust and Crimson](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10820443/1/An-Imago-of-Rust-and-Crimson) (**Worm x World of Darkness**) \[**ABANDONED**\] {**\~283,000 Words**}: My favorite worm fic by far. Taylor triggers with a particularly spooky ability that comes with some psychological baggage, no stations of canon here. A great AU that effectively merges the grimdark traditional rpg setting World of Darkness and the Worm universe.
    * [Maybe I'm a Lion](https://forums.nrvnqsr.com/showthread.php/1870-Maybe-I-m-a-Lion-%28KnK-Prototype-Crossover%29) (**Tsukihime x Prototype**) \[**ABANDONED**\] {**\~438,000 Words**}: One of my favorite fics. What happens when grimdark magic meets a superpowered bioweapon? A long and slow crossover with excellent integration, great writing and wonderful hype buildup. A basic understanding about both settings is highly recommended.
    * [Variant Strain](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8642442/1/Variant-Strain) (**Spiderman x Prototype**) \[**COMPLETE**\] {**\~322,000 Words**}: Another interesting prototype cross. Our friendly neighbourhood spiderman gets a totally new origin story courtesy of our favorite bioweapon. Yet another masterful mix of two worlds. Old foes in new forms and some delicious worldbuilding. The writing, plotting and pacing of this are all excellent and it's even completed!
    * [In the Shadow of Gods](https://archiveofourown.org/works/1099236/chapters/2211681) (**Mass Effect x Halo**) \[**ABANDONED**\] {**\~43,000 WORDS**}: Master Chief meets Shepherd. First contact done well. Short but worth it alone for the interactions.
    * [Man off the Moon](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12904733/1/Man-off-the-Moon) (**Mass Effect x Fate/Stay**) \[**IN PROGRESS (YES, REALLY!)**\] {**\~756,000 WORDS**}: Shirou ends up in the Mass Effect universe and goes through Space Boot Camp™ with a young Shepherd. A great look into how our favorite Magus would fare in a world of biotics and futuristic tech. A **V**ery **L**ong **R**ead with suprisingly consistent quality.
    * [Postnuptial Disagreements](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8078340/1/Postnuptial-Disagreements) (**Sekirei x Fate/Stay**) \[**COMPLETE**\] {**\~86,000 Words**}: A stuffy magus finds himself in an anime style harem battle royale "death" game. No harem here though. The real focus is on how a magus, brought up on stories of a much more ruthless battle royale death game, handles this one. Standard tropes are played with in fun ways thanks to the natural predisposition of our sheltered haughty magi protagonist. A standard crossover with excellent characterisation and praiseworthy writing.
    * [Mirror Mirror](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8275548/1/Mirror-Mirror) (**Avengers x Harry Potter**) \[**COMPLETE**\] {**\~53,000 Words**}: Shield wants the magic man. A great look into how a (semi-)professional superhero outfit with varying skillsets would match up against a standard "Master of Death"!Harry. Has a tight focus on the first contact interactions between Shield members themselves and with a skilled Harry Potter. (Warning, the grammar can be a little rough, and the science a bit too comic book-y.)
    * [Shadow of The Bay](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12840397/1/Shadow-of-the-Bay) (**Naruto x Worm**) \[**ABANDONED**\] {**\~52,000 Words**}: Tenten is a ruthlessly upbeat child soldier, with no qualms about murdering the outgroup for the greater good, from a shonen manga about the power of demons and friendship. She lands in Brockton Bay next to an unaffiliated Tattletale. A (mostly) believable take on how a professional ninja would fare in a world of capes and cowls. Unfortunately the exploration of the interaction between chakra/parahumanity isn't that interesting. Especially compared to how convincing the interactions between a "Ninja" and Parahuman culture are.
    * [Virtuous Sons](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/41330/virtuous-sons-a-greco-roman-xianxia/) (**Cultivation x Greek/Roman Mythology**) \[**In-Progress**\] {**\~375,000 Words**}: This is not really a crossover in the sense you mean, but I've simply got to shill for my favorite long form webfiction in the last year. [(Partially) Quoting myself: ](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/ra96c8/comment/ho813zw/) *A masterfully done "Buddy-Cop" Xianxia in Classical Antiquity. It seamlessly mixes both settings, with familiar tropes played with in clever ways. Anyone familiar with stories set in either setting will regard both the worldbuilding & plot with a breath of fresh air. The banter is top notch, Very engaging, Highly Recommended.*
    * [Savage Khepri](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/savage-khepri-post-gm-taylor-savage-divinity.803200/) (**Savage Divinity x Worm**) \[**On-Hiatus?**\] {**\~190,000 Words**}: Post-Worm, one apparently de-powered Taylor finds herself as a slave in the world of Savage Divinity. That eventually ends poorly for everyone involved. This seemed a little dark/depressing for my tastes at first by I stuck through the beginning and got a very interesting story about trauma, (imperfect) healing, how savage the Cultivation world can be, and Taylor biting back hard. I was especially fond of how aspects of her abilities bled through to the new setting.
    * [Sect](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/worm-xianxia-sect.989803/) (**Cultivation x Worm**) \[**In-Progress**\] {**\~130,000 Words**}: Sect has a similar-ish flavor as Savage Khepri. If you're familiar with the setting it's best described as "Taylor playing Ghost Grandpa to an abused Pill Cauldron". While the writing and the "magic-system" interaction is fun, It occasionally drags during explanatory exposition rather than naturally integrating that information into narrative. That's one feature from (generic) Cultivation stories I could do without.

    Edit: Added Savage Khepri and Sect

      Holy shit, In The Shadow of Gods is good. This plays exactly into why I like crossovers in the first place, and the prose is fantastic as a bonus. Shame the author seems to have determinedly wiped their online presence as an author, short of orphaning the fics themselves.

        In this sub-subgenre?  Not much, but there's a few.  Going through fics I've read, I see:

        For a Sci-Fi take, there's [First Contact: BSG (2003), Stargate: SG-1. ](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/first-contact-bsg-2003-stargate-sg-1.658966/).  After SG-1 builds a spaceship, it shows up at the BSG area shortly before the Cylons were planning to attack, and they have an interesting first contact.

        [Life Ore Death](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/life-ore-death-young-justice-crossover.489535/) is a DC Comics world with a character from Brandon Sanderson's *Mistborn* world inserted, and it has some clashes like that.  The world isn't so much "well established" (since Obloquy makes stuff up where Sanderson hasn't said anything), but it is still consistent and similar.  It's also a single character instead of an entire world colliding.

        There are a few more Worm crosses on Spacebattles that kind of fit (particularly D&D and Exalted ones), but they tend to swap out just Taylor's superpower.

    This is probably my favorite category of fic. I’ll update with links after work.

    [Postnuptial disagreements](): On one side, you have a fanservice battle royale comedy/drama with magical pair bonding. On the other, you have *Sekirei*. The two are wildly incompatible and it is glorious.

    [ASoIa Fires that Weren’t All My Fault]() puts Harry Dresden's formal yet punk wizardry into the grim vagueness of Westeros.

    As someone who absolutely loves crossovers between magical systems, [Making Magick](https://fanfiction.net/s/7667766/1/Making-Magick) isn't *exactly* what you're looking for, but is so fun I can't not recc it. The story is a FoZ / Magicka crossover (and I know, ugh, FoZ) that features Louise reverse-summoning herself into the Magicka universe. She's completely out of her depth both societally and magically, and trying to understand what's going on is a blast.

    Slightly closer, [Psi Effect](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/psi-effect-me-xcom-thread-2-rise-of-the-party-boat.307972/) is a full-on fusion between XCOM and Mass Effect. Obviously these are closer to supernatural effects than actual fantasy magic systems, but it's a great story that manages to have a powerful humanity without the usual OP HFY pseudo-fascist circlejerk. It primarily follows a band of human mercenaries disgused as Asari, led by femShep and a (mostly) willing Asari commando.

      Yeah, and the unfortunate part about it is that when that's the whole "shtick" of the story, it allows basically endless Deus ex Machinas. This has happened a few times but seems to be getting more common. Everything that shouldn't be allowed by the system just gets solved with "oh well they are super unique and break the rules", but this happens in a way that is completely illegible/unpredictable not only to the reader, but seemingly also to the characters themselves.

      Don't get me wrong, I'm enjoying the story (mostly, so far, there are hints that I may end up dropping it, but it's been enjoyable up to now), but this is most _definitely_ not a rational work, let a lone a rationalist work. It's very nearly the antithesis. 

      Probably the only part of it that sort of matches the general rational work guidelines is that, when it comes to interpersonal interactions, the characters do not carry the idiot ball for the sole sake of creating drama.

      However, even in the case of the character interactions, the flaw is that we were dropped in way too late. We did not see any of the bonds forming in the party that justify the level of understanding/camaraderie that we observe. If the story wanted to focus on a team that trusts each other in the face of all kinds of bad shit, it would be _much_ more rewarding to have seen that trust grow and evolve over time. Instead we were basically presented with "here's a group of friends with unshakeable bonds, watch them solve problems through friendship and author fiat".

      Again, I know this comment sounds very critical, but I am actually enjoying the story, partly because it is just so refreshing to not have stupid soap opera character drama that infests so much of fiction (of all types). I'm not sure how far that will continue to carry my interest, but it is so far.

    It is written very well, and has an interesting world and characters, but I just get put off by the relationships and interactions between the main character. 

    It feels like we're being shown how they've grown as people and as a group, after all the hardship and interpersonal conflicts they've gone through—and I started reading in the middle of the book, having skipped all that.

  Okay I finished *Artemis* (Andy Weir's maligned second book) about a week ago and here's my final review:

  - Overall the vibe was much more amateur than PHM or The Martian, so I can see why people didn't like it as much. As I said a few weeks ago, for me it's A tier, not S tier.

  - I liked the main character and found her very relatable (and yes I'm a woman) - was she the best written character ever? No, but she was fine

  - Some of the characters were rather poorly written. In particular:

    - the gay best friend just constantly made references to the fact he was gay. it felt almost like Weir was worried about seeming uncomfortable with it? IDK. I just had to make it in my mind that gay!BFF was just the sort of awkward person who talks about that stuff a lot 

    - i found it easy to believe that the love interest liked Jazz, but I couldn't see why she liked him apart from the fact he was a Nice Guy (tm). Romance wasn't the main point of the book though, and it's left on a "they will start dating" note rather than a "five years later they have 12 kids" note, so I'm not too bothered.

    - the billionaire's daughter. did Weir not have a sensitivity reader? Basically, the billionaire's daughter lost use of her legs in a car crash so he moved the family to the moon so she could walk easier on crutches. I really, really wanted Weir to include *something* about disability rights / etc in there because there is *so much* discourse these days about 'fixing' disabled people when many of them don't want to be fixed (yes, many do! different people want different things!). 

         - like to me the denoument of this could be Daughter saying "oh yes i murdered my father because he wants me to live on the moon when i'm a billionaire i would have a much better life on earth especially with all our future technology" or somehow acknowledging the fact that the issue for many disabled people is accessibility - like, ramps and shit like that. Talk about how the moon base not only has low gravity but has disability access features as standard or something as a reason for moving there?????????

    - basically i'm just kinda disappointed that this angle wasn't explored more, and it was presented in such a shallow way

  - The trademark Weir "science: the cause of, and solution to, all life's problems" is in effect and really good/fun

  - I found the worldbuilding of the moon base really, really good

  - The macguffin was meh as was the plot all around that

  - I thought the ending, where we found out >!what Jazz needed the money for!<, was really nice and I didn't expect it even though it's very obvious in retrospect

  ---

  Some recommendations related to my rant about disability:

  - The now retired flash forward podcast https://www.flashforwardpod.com/ talks about futurism and often talks about how it affects marginalised communities - there was one where they interviewed a guy developing robot exoskeltons in part because it would help his paralysed brother walk again and also interviewed the brother who was like "no i am very happy with my wheelchair and it makes me kind of uncomfortable that my brother would rather invent me a whole exoskeleton than just have our city install ramps everywhere which is all i really need" (that episode is here: https://www.flashforwardpod.com/2018/05/08/enter-the-exos/ )

    Hmm...I have two recommendations. 

    The Dollop podcast - which goes into funny parts of American history that you never knew about. The Ten cent beer night at a baseball game which turned into a riot, the biggest espionage case in US history was broken because a drug dealer got drunk in mexico, did you know there was a New York to Paris car race that took place in the middle of winter in America? Some episodes aren't that interesting while others are hilarious. 

    A Libertarian walks into a bear - a true story where a group of Libertarians decide to take over a small town and dismantle its government completely. But they didn't count on the bears. No hunting licenses, no regulations on food disposal, a tent city to get off the grid, arguments on freedom, gun play, backstabbing politicians, people feeding bears because they don't like being told what to do. Then the bears getting hungry and curious. Funny and depressing.

    If you enjoy historical non-fiction, I highly recommend Erik Larson's novels:

    [The Devil in the White City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Devil_in_the_White_City) follows the lives of Daniel H. Burnham and others who designed and built the Chicago World's Fair in 1893. The story delves into fascinating details about architecture, technology, American culture, and the burgeoning labor movement at the turn of the century. Juxtaposed with the Fair's shining symbol of progress, the story also follows the life of Dr. H. H. Holmes, a notorious conartist and serial killer who murdered most of his victims within the apartment building he owned just 3 miles from the border of the Fair.

    [In the Garden of Beasts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_the_Garden_of_Beasts) follows the life of the American Ambassador to Germany and his daughter during their stay in Berlin in the year leading up to the Night of the Long Knives. The story examines the reasons why so many warning signs of the coming violence went unheeded, and how even 'good' people got swept up in the seemingly glamorous early days of nationalist fervor in Hitler's Germany.

    Another great historical non-fiction book, [The River of Doubt](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/78508.The_River_of_Doubt) by Candice Millard, recounts Theodore Roosevelt's nearly-fatal journey to chart an un-mapped river in the Amazon after his failed election campaign of 1912.

    If you like non-fiction podcasts:

    I've recently been listening to Radiolab's [More Perfect](https://www.npr.org/podcasts/481105292/more-perfect) series. Each episode provides fascinating context, including interviews and historical audio clips, to explore the mindsets of the people behind some of the most influential Supreme Court cases in the United States as well as the occasionally unexpected impact of the Court's decisions.

    I recently read [The Age of Surveillance Capitalism: The Fight for a Human Future at the New Frontier of Power](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26195941-the-age-of-surveillance-capitalism).

    It's about how "Big Tech" and the data-extraction paradigm they're re-orienting around is a very big deal. More specifically how egregious the new rules of engagement that they're trying establish really are.

    Bit preachy for my tastes, but understandable I guess given how important the author thinks it is. Seeing the author lay out the details so starkly really opened my eyes to her perspective.

    Unfortunately I think the author misses that AGI is coming\[1\]\[2\] and their worries are part-(dis)regulation worries, part-"AI-safety-by-way-of-AI-governance" worries. For me, that lent a lot of weight to their fears, which is ironic, considering the author sees AGI/Generic tech optimism as "(manipulative) utopic marketing" in a campaign to capture human capital.

    The author worries about how Big Tech is reshaping the human experience (both inadvertently and intentionally) but doesn't realize that the tech powering that flywheel will grow radically more competent at planning and achieving the purpose it's given.

    People talk a lot about the radical effects the social media feed has on us. But as we approach a world where virtually all content will be mediated by some feed or another\[3\], governed by neural networks tasked with keeping us engaged, the true threat looks less like AI-Terminator and more like an ostensibly "voluntarily" dis-empowered humanity\[4\]\[5\].

    It's more important than ever that we design systems that don't fall prey to perverse incentives and take advantage of undesirable feedback loops so as not to "optimize us too hard" in directions we don't want. A shame the author failed to extend this realization from the institution, to the artifact.

    All together, a pretty compelling read. Recommended.

  There was a story I’m having a hard time finding, where the afterlife for people who died on Monday was just arguing about whether or not Jon Arbuckle drank dog semen. Does that sound familiar to anyone?
