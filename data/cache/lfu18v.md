## A Recommendation for El-Ahrairah by Anderein

### Post:

A review of HPMOR; I replied to a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/WormFanfic/comments/ldy560/weekly_rwormfanfic_discussion_what_have_you_been/gm8ivyg?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) in r/wormfics. They were recommending a Worm fanfiction named [El-Ahrairah](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/el-ahrairah-worm.372987/reader/) to the larger community. I recommended HPMOR in turn, for reasons detailed below. 

I'm here to recommend El-Ahrairah to anyone who hasn't yet encountered it. For context, El-Ahrairah is what got me onto rational fics to begin with, is what brought me towards HPMOR. All this to say, if you are familiar with the larger Parahumans universe, frequent this sub, and haven't yet encountered this fic-- give it a gander.

The comment:

>Hey, if you liked El-Ahrairah, then you'll probably also enjoy [Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality](http://www.hpmor.com/) (HPMOR). It's a complete fic (with a high-quality sequel called Significant Digits) wherein a *weirdly*  intelligent Harry Potter gets his acceptance letter to Hogwarts after eleven years of being raised by an Oxford Professor of (some unspecified) Science. Among his goals are to discover the underlying  laws governing magic, achieve omnipotence, and defeat Death and all of  it's manifestations upon the planet Earth. ~~Hijinks ensue.~~  
>  
>Later in El-Ahrairah, Taylor notes that James and Jacob have a similar fighting style, both owing their roots to King.  I feel the same way about these two fictions-- the fics both touch on  similar themes, similar beats, and similar writing styles, even while  being two separate works of fiction with their individual voices.  
>  
>I'll give you three examples:  
>  
>1.) Ambitious  protagonist with heroic intentions who nonetheless must be cautious  that they don't follow their good intentions too far down a path of  villainy.  
>  
>2.) A  web of interconnected schemes and plots. A significant part of the  appeal of both these fics to me (El-Ahrairah first and then HPMOR) are  those moments when a hidden plot element is revealed to the reader, and  the story as you know it is recontextualized completely. Or even better,  you predict the hidden element and wait for the shoe to drop in-text.  
>  
>3.) Intelligent characters and *meaningful* dialogue. There is so much packed into these stories, with *so many*  critical conversations that you don't fully understand until you give  them a re-read. I've read both El-Ahrairah and HPMOR many times over in  the past few years, and I'm *still* having moments where I think to myself, "*Ohhhh.* I understand that character's motivations a  bit better now. *Fuck*, that's clever writing." It seems like every character has *texture*.  I can't explain exactly what I mean by that, except to say that I rate  both of these stories' handle of character on a similar level that I  rate Wildbow's stories'.  
>  
>And of course, there's also the fact that ~~Anderein is obviously the author of HPMOR writing under a psudonym~~ I seem to remember Anderein referencing  '[The Abridged Guide to Intelligent Characters](https://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing),'  which is written by the author of HPMOR. Though to be fair, I've also  spent 15 mins looking for the exact reference in the El-Ahrairah thread  and haven't found anything yet. Make of that what you will.  
>  
>In  any case, I personally rate HPMOR and El-Ahrairah on the same level of  quality. I think that anyone who enjoys one will enjoy the other.  
>  
>Edit:  Another thought-- I came into HPMOR having only read bits of the first  half of the Harry Potter series a decade ago. I think that a person will  be able to get into it with only passing knowledge of the main series.

  I'll add "El-Ahrairah" to the list with "The Waves Arisen", "The Erogamer", and "Fargo", but still not that one thing I actually wrote, that's been recced on /r/rational a few times, which nobody ever suggests I wrote.

    Why would anyone think you wrote Fargo, or any of those other things? Why do you think it's relevant they don't?

  Why is a Worm fanfic named after a character from Watership Down?

    Yeah. I was really amused by the idea of a Watership Down rational fic. Sorta disappointed now.

    She considered taking it as her cape name. It's a fairly accurate literal description: 'prince(ss) with a thousand enemies'.

  Btw somewhat unrelated comment: why does worm use spacebattles for fanfic so much? It feels harder to read from than other sites
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    SB is a place where munchkins and worldbuilding addicts gather, which made it a natural home for Worm fans. Once a platform reaches critical mass for fandom, it becomes very hard to move off it, since you want to be where the fans are to participate in the community. So Worm fans post their content on SB, which perpetuates the assumption that SB is the place for Worm fans. A loop is born.

    I know exactly what you mean, and I have no idea. I mostly read from either a phone or a dedicated e-reader, so I use sites like [https://fichub.net/](https://fichub.net/) to download .epubs of fics on Spacebattles and SufficientVelocity.
    ```

    - u/Zarohk:
      ```
      FanFicFare, an add-on for Calibre (the ebook management software), can scrape fics from Spacebattles and Sufficient Velocity quite well.

        FFF is great. Free and open source, and *highly* configurable so if you're picky about ebooks like I am you can spend a bit of time and all future ebooks will be exactly what you want. Sites like fichub are fine enough if I want to download something from my phone, but I'll always prefer FFF. 

        Though I feel I should pont out that it's also available as a standalone program, ran from the command line. I've only used the Calibre version so I can't speak to the standalone version, but I have to imagine it's pretty much the same.

  I was trying to get into but it was making me cringe how hard they were trying to make the protagonist into jack Slash v2. Like why would they all come to that conclusion? Feels so forced too

  They even joked around calling her Jacqueline Cut as if this guy isn't a torturous psychopath killer that's probably killed and tortured everything from children to old people. Like what? Why would they even do that, that's like me attributing someone to Richard ramirez or Ted Bundy because they're charismatic. In universe it's a really bad decision for them to make, legit someone worse than Hitler
  ```

  - u/Auroch-:
    ```
    Taylor is a psycho too, just not one with a career as distinguished as Jack's; Weaver 9 worked for a reason. Wildbow's writing hides it somewhat, because she doesn't see *herself* as a psycho, but she terrifies everyone around her. So yes, they're comparing her to the scariest known monster that *definitely* was born human (well, except Sleeper). Because she is *fucking scary*.

    And the thing where she was permanently tarred as Jack Slash 2 was Jack's idea, and part of his price for not cheating in their endgame. She arranged the Vegas duel to prove she should scare villains everywhere; he decided part of his price for 'fighting fair' was to leave her marked as a continuation of his story, since he was all about narrative.
    ```

    - u/mannieCx:
      ```
      Yeah that would be the case but that was not the tone taken in this fanfiction. They openly and forcibly (she hadn't done anything comparable to JS at that point in story) compare her to Jack Slash who commits so many known atrocities, some beyond what another human being could literally physically do to another. You take into account what Jack Slash means and all the really really bad stuff he's done against other heros and their family? Not to mention kids? It's as if I complimented someone for their ability to lead and said they're alot like Charles Manson or Hitler. It's ridiculous, unrealistic and cringey
      ```

      - u/Auroch-:
        ```
        >  that was not the tone taken in this fanfictio

        Yes it was? Everyone was scared of Administrator, except Cauldron. She's powerful and utterly ruthless, and doesn't try to hide it. Even the *Triumvirate* found her unnerving. The fear starts well before anyone makes the comparison. She scares *Glaistig Uaine* a little, for hell's sake (and then more than a little, when she >!sends her Jack!< as a present, but that's neither here nor there).
        ```

        - u/mannieCx:
          ```
          You just proved my point, they were scared of her because she was terrifying in scope of ability. That doesn't equal Jacqueline Cut. People are scared of Jack, not because of his ability but of the fucked up shit he's liable to do to any infants, kids and even heroes . That's a complete different type of fear, trying to equate it is being intellectually dishonest.
          ```

          - u/Auroch-:
            ```
            No, it's not a different type at all. People's reactions to Administrator are largely "I'm glad I'm not in her way", because she gives off the - accurate - vibe that if you *are* in her way very bad things will happen to you. And no one is really sure that 'very bad things' will actually stay north of Jack Slash (probably not even her). She's terrifying, not because she has *Administration: Coordination, Control-Locked*, but because *she is the kind of person who would be given that*. She is psychologically a baby Catastrophe, and only Contessa's direct recruitment preserved the 'baby' part. And that is a trait canon Taylor shares: she gets a powerful shard because psychologically, she can be relied upon to wreak havoc with whatever power (super- or mundane) she has available.

            Jack Slash is not the only other Catastrophe in the world. But in America, he's the one people know. (Most also know Nilbog, probably Sleeper, and maybe the Machine Army guy, though in that case not by name. But everyone knows Jack Slash.)
            ```

- u/Roneitis:
  ```
  Is there a blurb or description anywhere? SpaceBattles is weird. Also, is it done? The threadmarks make it look abandoned.
  ```

  - u/lucidobservor:
    ```
    Basic premise: Taylor gets the same shard, but her powers manifest as a Thinker instead of a Master. Cauldron immediately recruits her, Thinkering ensues.

    I'm pretty sure it's abandoned, but it ended at the end of a full arc. I liked it a lot and think it's worth a read, for what it's worth!
    ```

    - u/DuplexFields:
      ```
      I’ve read it, and it’s one of the best alternate takes. It said pretty much what it set out to say in the space it used.
      ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Not necessarily abandoned, but currently inactive. Author doesn't have a set schedule and only writes as a hobby, as it goes with fanfic.
    ```

- u/Dufaer:
  ```
  I tried reading El-Ahrairah in the past and didn't like it. It had a too Taylor-wanky tone, IIRC.

  I found that [Agent of Cauldron](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/agent-of-cauldron-worm.345669/) portrayed the internals of Cauldron in a way that felt much more realistic.
  ```

  - u/JackStargazer:
    ```
    I tried to read Agents of Cauldron. Emphasis on tried. It is such a disjointed chaotic mess, and it's not even written in such a way to make than enjoyable.
    ```

  - u/bless_ure_harte:
    ```
    I read it for a bit but I started noping out at the point where Taylor goes to Cauldron and says, paraphrased, "You have all been using your powers wrong, even though you've used them every day since 1987; I know one weird trick to using your power better, please subscribe to my free newsletter". It felt very /r/Iamverysmart to mr
    ```

  - u/maroon_sweater:
    ```
    AOC is definitely the superior portrayal of Cauldron. I didn't not somewhat enjoy El Vowels at one point in time, but the author doesn't get Cauldron.

    I also find the i know that you know that i know that you know that i know that you know that i know that you know that i know that you know "thinker" stuff to be tiresome.
    ```

  - u/BavarianBarbarian_:
    ```
    I can't disagree about Agent of Cauldron being a mess, but it's a *beautiful* mess. At some point in the fic, it devolves into >!a pileup of dozens of plans of powerful shady conspiracy groups all acting at once and running into each others' contingencies.!<
    ```
