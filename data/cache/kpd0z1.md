  ```
  This is a fanfiction of [Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality](http://www.hpmor.com/). The pace is quick, not lingering on details or fleshing things out when there's plot to advance. This style leads to a few moments of confusion, where a new element is introduced without much or any build up, but overall it seems quite fitting when considering the protagonist.

  This is excellent

    I didn't like it as much. It was alright, I did read all of it after all; but it's too absurdist for my taste.

      I feel like it definitely got weaker towards the end, despite some good moments. Quirrell in particular felt a little bit flanderdized here.

  This was almost the Harry Potter/Antimemetics Department crossover that I had always hoped for. Almost.
