## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  New poster, so I'm kinda unclear as to what this entails, but here goes.

  The power to increase/decrease your own weight, but you can only do so by a factor of, say, 5. So an 80lb person can make themselves anywhere between 20 and 400lb.

    How does this interact with items you carry or material that goes in/out your body? Does muscle/bone strength increase/decrease proportionally or does one almost lose consciousness at 5G? If the latter, try https://xkcd.com/620/. Insert remark about averted universal heat death.

      I'll say that it applies to anything currently inside your body, and the effect doesn't apply to things you hold. 

      So if you have something hidden in your stomach the effect applies to that, and stops once it's taken out. 

      Regarding muscle mass/strength/etc, I'll say that it doesn't increase, ie it stays as it was when the effect is not being used.

      Edit: so the square/cube problem would apply.

        Define "out". 

        Let's say I implant something in my hand. I then use my mass changing power. Then I chop off my hand. What happens to the mass of the implant? Does it revert? Does the hand still count as part of my "body"? 

        What if, instead of chopping off my hand, I just leave it dangling by a long string of skin? Or perhaps an intestine for longer range...

        Or better yet, what if I get lots of skin grafts? I mean, LOTS of extra skin. I could say, wrap a rocket in my skin, thus making the rocket "inside" my "body", and then decrease its mass so I can launch it into space for much much less fuel.

          This became horrifying really fast.

            The problem with trying to munchkin is that if your methods are too normal, someone would have already thought of it. So this really only leaves you with two ways to munchkin:

            (1) Design methods that exploit esoteric scientific facts, so people who don't know these facts can't think of these methods.

            (2) Design methods that involve such cruelty or self-mutilation that normal people's brains would censor them before they can even think of it. 

            I'm not a very smart person, so I usually rely on (2). My first thought whenever I'm asked to munchkin a superpower is: Can I chop off my hand to use it better? Surprisingly often, the answer is yes.

    Oscillate furiously to run a generator?

    That's kind of a hilarious thought, actually.

      "Oh...you know. Oscillating furiously."

    Work out, then win *all* the boxing matches by artificially placing yourself in the lightweight category and then maxing out your mass in the ring. Ditto for sumo and wrestling. Also you can probably do better than average with some olympic sports, e.g. high jump. Also nobody mentioned Randi's prize yet so this is the obligatory reference. After you do both of those, do the [superman](http://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/2011-07-13) for infinite energy for a while.
