  People here liked the previous book in the series, [Orconomics](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/56r15v/dcrtbook_orconomics/), when it was about Economics in a D&D-like world. So I'm posting the sequel here on the day of it's release.

  For some understanding, the first book in the series reads a lot like the author of the [Critical Hits](http://www.critical-hits.com/features/dungeonomics-bibliography/) blog chose to write a fantasy book. Even though I'm fairly sure the author of the book and the website are two different people.

    Are you? As not-so-recent events demonstrated, you can never be so sure of that, in our day and age.

        How cthulhuraejepsen, the author of [*Worth the Candle*](https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/25740126) — a high-quality web serial very popular on this subreddit — turned out to be Alexander Wales — one of the most well-known rational fiction authors — under a pseudonym.

          At this point I just assume all rational fic is written by Alexander Wales.

  The first one was hilarious and fun.  Looking forward to this one as well.
