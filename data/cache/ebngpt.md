## Could You Make a Rational Setting With a Lovecraftian Magic System?

### Post:

Something I've noticed is that the crux of any rational setting is a precise magic system. For instance, systems like Ra or Mother of Learning.

However when I look at my own magic system, I realize that it basically is the anti thesis to cleaner magic systems. The magic is alot closer to Lovecraft than DnD. It almost always involves doing something unpleasant or painful to get a result. It also requires an extreme amount of caution, and to be a consistent mage will eventually turn most practitioners into sociopaths. You can still be ethical and successful. However, even if your smart, you'd still have to essentially be fine with experiencing pain, slaughtering animals, using human remains and being witness to horrifying things. The Lovecraftian element definitely comes from the importance of summoning and negotiating beings that don't act rational or logical.

How would you treat such a magic system in story without having a straight up psychopathic protagonist? Does a Rational story need a clean and simple magic system?

  I think the answer is the same as for any other soft magic system: yes, but your ability to solve conflict with the magic system depends on how well the reader understands it ([Sanderson's First Law](https://brandonsanderson.com/sandersons-first-law/)). Soft magic systems are good for creating conflicts, but much less so for resolving them, because if there's no system of rules set up, then it's hard to have a satisfying conclusion using the rules. You can get around this a little bit by making a soft magic system which has hard elements to it, which are then used as the crux of resolution, but that can be a bit iffy. As an example, elves could be capable of all kinds of magic ... but can't lie. Or demons are capable of whatever they're not explicitly prohibited from doing. Or something like that.

  (And yes, I'm reducing "Lovecraftian" down to being part of the soft/hard magic paradigm. There are probably some arguments against this, but I don't want to preemptively get into it.)

    The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is, IMO, one of the more famous examples of someone screwing this up - the "soft magic" system solves everything and feels like a complete ass-pull when it happens.

            Lewis said it wasn’t an allegory. In today’s fan terminology, he mapped his understanding of the Christian Trinity into a multiverse, of which Earth was just one world out of infinity. The consequence, of course, was that in every world with both sapient life and sin, the Logos’ incarnation eventually chose to be executed to save one person’s life, and that sacrifice covered all the sins in that world, past and future.

            The munchkin in me demands to know if His blood was sufficient for all the sins of one universe, why doesn’t it cover all of the multiverse? Why would God the Father torture His Son by setting up the rules of the multiverse (“the deep magic from before time began”) so sacrifices stick to one universe? And how does Asian dying for a human, a son of Adam from Earth, cover the sins of talking squirrels?

            That’s the part of a “soft magic system” that concerns me, a lifelong Christian fan of Narnia.

    I definitely do intend to add in hard elements to balance out the weirdness. Though I'll admit that the term 'soft magic system' carries some stigma. I wanted initially to write a hard magic system but realized that a soft magic was a lot more fitting for the kind of story I'm writing..

  A major component of Lovecraftian horror is the fear of the unknown and being driven insane from seeing Things You Are Not Meant To Know, which I'm not sure applies here. In this case, if the protagonist were to uphold their moral code, I think they wouldn't fall into psychopathy (the lack of empathy or morality). Instead, I would presume that they'd just become desensitised to whatever specific things they're partaking in. 

  However, I'd argue that neither psychopathy nor desensitisation hinders rational thought. As long as it's not something that impacts the ability to use logic, I'd say that 'dirty' or morally dark magic systems are totally viable for a rational protagonist to use.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    I can definitely capture the fear of the unknown. Generally speaking there is an element of gambling with your mind and never knowing if your going to slip and fall into the abyss. People with magic are generally speaking people who see outside the 'firmament' and are changed by it. They either become psychologically destroyed or fascinated. It's akin to seeing something disturbing, and continuing to look at it because you can't get it out of your head.

    In regards to the psychopathy, it's serve as a concern that does get in the way of the main character's thought. I wrote the main character as someone who is pretty conscious of their mental health and is aware of what he risks becoming. A common habit that arises from magic users that target people, is that they're very good at convincing themselves that their victims deserve what happens to them.
    ```

    - u/BoxSparrow:
      ```
      Oh, if there's literal human sacrifice involved, then I suppose there'll be a fair amount of drifting of moral values. Would be intersting to play around with Schelling fences and such. 

      As a side note, 'psychopathy' is (often) defined as coming from genetics, while 'sociopathy' is something shaped by society, so I think the latter would be a better term to use here.

  The Laundry Files by Charles Stross is likely the most rationalized take on Lovecraft that is still strongly Lovecraft. His main twist is computers can do many of the acts of ritual magic/computation that people can, so protagonist is a former CS grad student working for the British secret occult agency.

    Another Lovecraft homage which could work as a rational setting is *Winter Tide* by Ruthanna Emrys.

    I don't know if you'd consider it "strongly Lovecraft," though.

    The premise is that all these people being driven insane appropriated the rites and rituals of summoning from a culture who actually knew how to do them safely, and then the thieves stripped off all of the warning labels and started experimenting.

    The protagonist is someone from that culture, who is trying to help the government track down a spy who might have some dangerous magic, while at the same time trying to leverage that mission to reclaim her people's stolen stuff, which is being held at Miskatonic.

    As far as quality goes, I'd definitely read a sequel.
    ```

- u/best_cat:
  ```
  I'd set it up so that, if you stare into the abyss, there's a chance that you can wrap your mind around a Secret.

  The ritual of Zalgo would grant you a full understanding of the fact that h̞͔͜ụ͍̞̹̤̟ṃ̛̟͖͕̰͖a͏n̹̬͙̖̪i̥̱̗̝͓t̺̯̼̝y̧͓̰͙̫ ̰̩̰i͎̤̫̖̟̳͞ṣ̹̰͍ ̛̯̭̼̫̠ͅͅin̡̬̲͚̩s̭̮̞̠͓̯̲̕į̦̘g͚̠͚̘̞̕ͅn͈͉̜i̹̩͙̪f́i̘̩̬̼͈c̻̞̤a̘̱͈͈̫̻n̤͍͎̠͙̳t͓̬́ in the cosmos. 

  On the upside, understanding your own insignificance lets you put yourself beneath the notice of other people, too.  This makes you effectively invisible. 

  From a mechanics perspective, I'd treat these "Secrets" as being closer to superhero powers than magic spells.

  But - to limit things a bit - I'd suggest that activating the powers is typically difficult, on par with willing yourself to cry.   And over use might have side effects like making the power always on.  (See: ForgetMeNot)

  Then, while there are rituals to help, it's also possible that people who have extraordinary experiences, or just weird mindsets, get powers "naturally".

  Sometimes this would be good.  Astronauts get their minds bent by the [overview effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overview_effect) and get a power that makes it impossible for anyone to willingly commit violence near then.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    I like the idea of a 'secret' as a main or special power of sorts. People who gain magic are people who died and were able to see past the 'firmament' so it kind of fits. It would solve some issues by having a power that's reliable alongside magic that's riskier. Though casting the magic isn't hard part, the problem is the prep and dealing with the consequences after.
    ```

    - u/grekhaus:
      ```
      The basic essence of Lovecraft isn't that magic corrupts, it's that magic implies that reality is far different from how it is understood by early 1900s New Englanders. The big frightening reveals are things like:

      * a respectable member of society is product of miscegenation
      * the main character is product of miscegenation
      * there exists intelligent alien life totally unlike humans
      * alien civilizations have better technology than we do
      * there are other intelligent species on earth besides humans
      * there exist geographical regions which have not yet been discovered
      * the Christian God is not real, but other Gods are real
      * humanity has no special significance in the universe 
      * a murderer wishes to kill the main character due to their ancestry
      * the soul does not exist and brain damage causes personality damage

      But, to quote a friend of mine:

      Today if I say to the man on the street, "Did you know that the world you live in is a fragile veneer of normality over an uncaring universe, that we could all die at any moment at the whim of beings unknown to us for reasons having nothing to do with ourselves, and that as far as the rest of the universe is concerned, nothing anyone ever did with their life has ever mattered?" his response, if any, will be "Yes, of course; now if you'll excuse me, I need to retweet Sonic the Hedgehog." What do you even do with that?

      The answer is, you need to find *new cosmic secrets* that have not yet been proliferated to the point of becoming cliche. Which leads exactly into what /u/best_cat is talking about.

  I think of Lovecraftian rituals as trying to map matrix onto a higher dimensional space. There isn't enough information for the higher space, but that's where magic happens. 

   Well, entities existing at that level can fill in the gaps for you. For a price. Then the ritual ends, and now you need to map your expanded mind back to a lower dimensional space.  But there are new bits to add in now. Things that don't mesh with the you from before.  

  A different mind emerges from the experience. This would look like you went a bit loopy from practicing magic. And it would happen with each ritual.

  - u/Argenteus_CG:
    ```
    I've been working on a magic system (for TTRPG campaign use) based on the principle of "hard magic upsides, soft magic downsides", inspired by one of Pixar's rules for storytelling: "Coincidences that get the protagonists into trouble are great, coincidences that get them out of trouble are terrible". So what the magic can accomplish is bound by hard magic rules, but the side effects of the magic aren't and can be soft and even plot-based. This is intended for a TTRPG campaign, but the principle could be used elsewhere.
    ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Really. How does that work?
    ```

    - u/alexanderwales:
      ```
      You have two magic systems with their own distinct ways of being, one of which is heavily rules-based (or at least has clear rules presented to the reader), while the other is more wishy-washy (or at least doesn't have clear rules presented to the reader). [paragraph-long digression on hard and soft magics being a reader-facing distinction goes here] Because hard magic systems are (generally) better at resolving conflicts and soft magic systems are better at creating conflict, you can have your protagonist use hard magic and your antagonist use soft magic.

      In a Lovecraft-inspired work, you could have the Deep Ones (or whatever) be following rituals and rites that the main character and the reader doesn't understand or comprehend, except that the unclear consequences of completion are Bad. The protagonist could then be following their own magic system as a contracted servitor of some eldritch being, which creates bounded problems to be worked around (hallucinations, cravings, impulse problems, lost time, lost memories, changes in qualia, what have you) and bounded effects to be harnessed.

      If you wanted them in "one" system you could mix detriments and benefits, so that the former are "soft" and the latter are "hard", e.g. when you make a pact with the elder gods, you know precisely what you'll get out of it, but have only vague guesses about what price is going to be paid. Hard to do properly though, I would think.

      (*The Name of the Wind* mostly just has its different magic systems living side by side, not trying to make a point or anything, at least so far as I can recall.)
      ```

    - u/Hust91:
      ```
      I mean practically speaking you just have two kinds of magic in the setting, like how Warcraft III has magecraft (normal magic, gather mana and shape it into a thing), shamanism (convince a powerful spirit to do a thing) and holy light (reach for ~~the void~~ the light and let it fill you and use it to do things).
      ```

- u/Hust91:
  ```
  I don't think the magic system is necessarily a rational part at all.

  If the "magic" is simply "go ask a crazy and capricious being to lend you a hand with a thing" you might of course get very inconsistent results depending on context and how you present yourself and whether it finds human appearance to be offensive.

  The protagonists don't necessarily need to be rationalists themselves, they can be crazy people with delusions and everything, but the important thing is that they act like people who react to information presented to them in a believeable way.

  If their mind is breaking under immense stress of their life situation or the intense tearing pain of the things they have seen, that may well be a fully rational reaction.

  For example, one of the principles from the sidebar is to encourage intellectual pay-off. I don't think it's necessary that the protagonist be the one who comes up with the intellectual pay-off if he's losing his damn mind, or it could be the result of a plan he set in motion before he lost his mind, or it could simply be the the Bad Guys Win because they are serving a literally unbeatable deity and this is the story of how those who found out about the plot were powerless to stop it despite great skill and power.

  As long as the rules are applied consistently (even when the rule is "the crazy eternally suffering Supergod Nupnup controls everything and does whatever his insane mind conjures up and he has yet to accidentally undo the entire planet the story takes place on") and the people are people and not just characters following a plot, and it's not boring, it may be almost hard to go wrong.

  The "not boring" part being the truly challenging one.

  ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    *Dark Wizard of Donkerk* does, but they're not terribly Lovecraftian in nature. Sacrifism involves ritual sacrifice (requiring three parts: intent, ritual, and sacrifice) but if you're a dark wizard, then you're *usually* just working off what you've been able to find in books, rather than conducting novel research, and so long as you stay within the bounds of those books, your sanity is never at risk any more than it would be from, say, working in a slaughterhouse, working as an executioner, or being a military commander sending men into the thresher for the Greater Good. Namely, you might worry about getting desensitized, values drift, or something akin to PTSD ... which *is* a little Lovecraftian, I guess. The spirits that you perform these rituals "for" don't actually bargain, nor do they reveal their rituals except to those who perform them, and their motives (if any) are completely opaque. There's no temptation except that temptation of good effects at a reasonable price, no more than, say, a billionaire offering you a million dollars to cut off and eat your left hand.

    >!Mental sacrifism is a bit different, because you're sacrificing mental things rather than physical things, happy memories instead of fingers, but not that much different, and working from the same base.!<

    Denialism is the other one, which is even less Lovecraftian, more about continuous mental strain of modifying your behavior rather than the upfront costs of sacrifice. I'm not sure that it has an analogue, since it's much more inspired by monastic practices and religious vows. The mental effects are much different, and the flavor is "holy" rather than "dark".

  I think you can make a rational horror story with it. Rationally minded person finds out that the universe is, at its deepest level, fundamentally, fractally chaotic.

  I'd be interested to take it even further in what I define as lovecraftian:  how does rational fiction work when magic is inherently based on madness and chaos?  where the rules and effects change constantly, your senses can't be trusted, and a mischievous demon really does control your reality?

  maybe it's just impossible, or you just get something like SCP.  I'm currently engaged in a collaborative writing project with a semi-lovecraftian setting, though, so I'll be exploring it as best I can =)

  This sounds cool to me. This part especially:

  >The Lovecraftian element definitely comes from the importance of summoning and negotiating beings that don't act rational or logical.

  As for how you might use such a system without a psychopathic protagonist, well, there's a lot of options. Perhaps your protagonist is an 'ends justify the means' sort, willing go to brutal lengths to accomplish their goals but ultimately idealistic in their intention. That first one is the sort you most have to watch out for drifting into psychopath territory. Perhaps someone horrified by what they're doing, but who has some central goal which they can't accomplish by other means, meaning their choices are to either give up or to reluctantly use magic to move forward? Or someone who is well intentioned, but terminally curious... Lots of possibilities here, is the point. I don't have much experience writing, but I think any of these explanations could allow for non-psychopathic PCs if you were doing a tabletop RPG campaign for example.

    LotM is the first thing I thought of too. It has a very strictly laid out Lovecraftian style magic system based on Tarot suits and ranking within that. 

    The top rank of each Tarot card is a god. And the pool of resources to get into each rank is limited so that it's only ever possible to have one god for each card. And each rank has strict progression requirements. Failure means insanity. Even success in some of the darker paths means insanity.

    It's probably one of the cleanest magic systems I've come across.

  Speaking of stories where the protagonist is somewhat insane and the 'insanity' is necessary to be able to use magic, [See Noir Evil](https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-16978/MMcGregor+See+Noir+Evil.htm) is a fantastic post-series Buffy fanfiction about a Xander who is not entirely sane.

  It's very well-written, but it involves him going crazy due to months of torture and while it's not overly gory, it doesn't shy away from describing his trauma and fears of never being sane again, and whether or not he is experiencing reality versus a hallucination. It starts with him escaping from his captives and the first two or three chapters are a good measure of the worst the story will get with its descriptions. I recommend ignoring the last two chapters, because they appear to be meant as a fairly confusing sequel hook which never got followed up on.

  I honestly think it might be cool to have a story with a Psychopathic Good protagonist: perhaps they have noble utilitarian goals and throw aside conventional morality to pursue them, it could make for an interesting anti-hero type. Although it could be a problem as it makes your protagonist just look more insufferable when that's already a perceived problem with many ratfics.

  Your description of the magic and describing it as Lovecraftian reminds me of an interesting pair of examples from tabletop RPGs.

  If you like the modern Cthulhu Mythos, you've probably played Call of Cthulhu, with its well known SAN point system of insanity and the Mythos skill, which degrades your SAN to learn. This is a fairly good system for implementing Lovecraft's vision, but it doesn't sound that much like your described rules.

  A less well-known RPG, Unknown Armies, has a system which sounds much closer. (It's, like CoC, a percentile dice system, and similar in some other respects as well. But that's tangential.) It calls its insanity mechanics the Stress Tracks, and I thoroughly encourage use of them in literally any horror game of any type, with some fine-tuning for what your game cares about. Every character has five tracks; Self, Isolation, Helplessness, Violence, and Unnatural. (The number and nature of these tracks is the fine-tuning to be done.) Any extreme stressful situation has an associated track and number from 1 to 10, e.g. being attacked with a weapon is rank 1 Violence stress, watching someone you love die is rank 8 Helplessness stress, deliberately destroying everything you've risked your life to build is rank 10 Self stress. Each track has 10 Hardened marks and 5 failed marks. When you encounter stress, if you have Hardened ranks on the right track equal to its rank, you're fine. Otherwise, you roll; a success means you add one Hardened notch and a failure means you add a failed notch. Fail five notches on the same track and you go permanently insane and will fail all stress checks on that track until and unless you are cured. Fill two Hardened tracks to the top, or 28 total Hardened marks (28 = just over halfway to filling the entirety of the Hardened side), and you become a certified sociopath, which cuts you off from using the game's magic and also your "Stimuli" (Noble, Rage, and Fear) which are the way the game models the things you are most passionate about. (Going against your Stimuli, also called Passions, always causes some degree of stress on the Self track, which is the primary purpose of the Self track.)

  This mechanic is light-weight enough that having it "behind the curtain" of a story doesn't impose much work on you as a writer, and if you tied it into the magic system you can get something that allows for a soft feel while still having real rules to rein you in. As an example, Greg Stolze adapted the stress track system to a Cthulhu Mythos RPG; there there is only one track, Mythos, but the skill you need to cast spells, Mythos, cannot be higher than your number of (failed+hardened) marks on the track * 5%, and experiencing a spell, including casting it, provokes Mythos stress with a rank proportional to the "size" of spell. (EDIT: My memory was slightly off, [PDF here (pages 18-24)](https://www.arcdream.com/pdf/Nemesis.pdf).) But adapting it to your description:

  >  It almost always involves doing something unpleasant or painful to get a result. It also requires an extreme amount of caution, and to be a consistent mage will eventually turn most practitioners into sociopaths. You can still be ethical and successful. However, even if your smart, you'd still have to essentially be fine with experiencing pain, slaughtering animals, using human remains and being witness to horrifying things. The Lovecraftian element definitely comes from the importance of summoning and negotiating beings that don't act rational or logical.

  Whatever fuel you use to power magic, it seems to be generated by things which provoke stress in unjaded (i.e. un-"Hardened") people. Undergoing torture, bloody slaughter of animals, viewing eldritch horrors. So anyone who does this frequently will quickly become somewhat jaded or "flunk out" and go nuts, and if the requirements for fuel generation scale with the scale of the magic to be carried out, anyone who does large-scale magic will go nuts or become *very* jaded. Summoning some beings might be stress on multiple tracks at once at high ranks (e.g. seeing Yog-Sothoth and comprehending some fraction of the control and prescience he has over the entire universe sounds to me like rank-10 stress on both Unnatural and Helplessness). You might even make part of the cost *require distress from the user*, i.e. a stress check they're already Hardened to doesn't generate 'fuel'.

  That's just spitballing, but hopefully illustrative spitballing. As a side note: I didn't mention anything about how you go about making the stress check, which was intentional. I would definitely not suggest rolling dice to determine how your characters handle the stress unless you are genuinely uncertain which option serves the story better and would be fine with flipping a coin for it.

  A lot to unpack there.

  To have a "purist" Rational/Rationalist book you would need a precise magic system.  There...aren't a lot of truly "purist" Rational/Rationalist works.

  There is nothing incompatible about a sociopath hero and a Rational/Rationalist book.  Rationality and Ethics are entirely different parameters.  You could have a compassionless character who cares about nothing but power making rational decisions to reach that end.

  The larger problem with a "Lovecraftian" magic system is one of the core principles of the Lovecraftian ethos is that the universe in general (and the supernatural in specific) is fundamentally unknowable to humans.  This is directly contrary to the spirit of rationalism.

  The hero going insane as he uses magic would also be problematic, as eventually he would cease to be rationalist.  An insane protagonist in an unknowable universe would kind of be the opposite of rationalist fiction.  


  I suppose it would be amusing to have a book where the hero tried to use logic to plan around the fact spell working caused a period of mood swings and hallucinations...tried to develop rules of thumb to determine what was and wasn't a hallucination.

    The part about Lovecraft's ethos and rationality does sort of sum up my issue.

    However I strongly disagree about the insanity part. I've read alot of his work and people tend to flanderize the role insanity plays in Lovecraft. Alot of it is trauma that comes from genuinely horrifying revelations, and witnessing disturbing events. The whole 'your mind breaks from seeing a shoggoth' comes from people who broke down during stressful situations, such as being chased by horrific beings like Cthulhu or said Shoggoth. The insanity isn't some magical effect, that's just the human response to something horrifying. It's akin to learning that all the things you feared were true, aren't just true, but far worse.

    In the Call of Cthulhu. The Sailors are stranded in R'lyeh, that they psychologically cannot navigate. Imagine being in a house where your afraid to move because one wrong step puts you in another room, or you lean and suddenly the wall becomes your floor and your paralyzed with fear because moving forward doesn't take you forward and moving left doesn't take you left. Cthulhu is waking as well, and is this presence bearing down on their minds. Now he appears as something moving and indescribably large. Imagine if you saw Mount Everest in the distance and a spider crawls across the landscape. You think it's a trick of perspective until you see the legs actually touch the mountain and the spider simply skittered over it.

    People get disturbed easily by things that are larger than us, or things that our minds can't reconcile. I've seen a beached a whale and I've felt put off by it. A live whale is even worse, because something about it's size makes it off putting when it moves. Scuba Divers have been known to panic when they reach the open ocean and find themselves surrounded in literally nothing but the color blue as far as they can see. Even the wrong texture on something, like if it resembles meat, moves, or has too many holes can trigger a fear response.I could go on, but the fact is Lovecraft's character don't have their sanity blasted because eldritch horror, they had their insanity ground away by experiencing a nightmare that a normal brain can't do justice.

    Being perfectly logical and rational doesn't stop someone from being disturbed or scarred by witnessing disturbing events. That's just being human. Even without Great Old Ones we're still very sensitive and struggle to process certain stimuli regardless of how intelligent or aware of our situation we are.

    The necronomicon is a tome of eldritch lore, but it's still just a book that someone can pick up, read and put down without any consequences. But later works have to turn into this memetic insanity text for some reason.

    Lovecraft's work also shows that people in the know how can still bend the rules and gain some power. Like the Joseph Curwen, Keziah Mason, and the Undying Priests.

    I'll admit my I kind of have a thing for Lovecraft's horror. Mainly because I like the sea and being trapped in a building with impossible geometries has been a very common nightmare in my life.

      This is what I have always though! First time I read Lovecraft, I was "why everyone becomes crazy so easily?" Now I see that is not the creatures causing it but the particular protagonists.

      And don't forget that you can appear to be "insane" just because you're acting on information which other people don't have. Being terrified of right angles sounds Totally Crazy, but if you know that the Hounds of Tindalos can get to you through them then suddenly it's a lot more reasonable to build a protective house with gently curving surfaces and exactly zero corners.

      Honestly this seems like a well-reasoned and thorough argument for why the rational protagonist of a Lovecraftian story *does not go insane*.

      You might even argue that to H.P. Lovecraft himself the concept of the Rational Protagonist might as well *be* the horrifying unknowable thing that he'd write about, because a Rational Protagonist is fundamentally at home in the midst of Weird Shit in a way that is antithetical *to* being Broken By The Unknowable.
