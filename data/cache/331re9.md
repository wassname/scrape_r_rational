  Damn. That was like reading some of Sanderson's best work, well done! I'll be following this :)

    That's why it seemed so familiar! Yeah, it feels a lot like a Sanderson book. Effective prose, subtle characterization, awe-inspiring magic with hidden shades of complexity, and exquisite worldbuilding.

  I do have a subreddit set up for this over at /r/shadowsofthelimelight, if anyone wants to use that. Also, [a Patreon campaign](https://www.patreon.com/alexanderwales) which (if nothing else) will let you see what I look like. Mirrored on [FictionPress here](https://www.fictionpress.com/s/3248665/1/Shadows-of-the-Limelight).

    I find it hilarious that money is a form of power in our world, and your Patreon campaign essentially allows you to turn your fame into money. Did you intentionally release your Patreon with this story for that reason?

    - u/alexanderwales:

      No, that's just a happy coincidence. :)

    Nice start :-) I've pledged to Patreon. Now I'm also really looking forward to The Dark Wizard of Donkerk because I really liked the setting but Shadows of the Limelight will be very good too I think.

    It might be better to make a subreddit for all your writings rather than creating a new subreddit for each new work. Otherwise, you would just end up with a bunch of dead and inactive subreddits.

    Alternately, wait until you become popular enough until the mods start pestering you to start your own subreddit?

      I'm squatting /r/alexanderwales (and have been for something like three years, because why wouldn't you take namespace that rightfully belongs to you?). If there's ever a need to, I'll switch over to that, but I need a bit more under my belt first, I think.

      (Currently /r/alexanderwales contains a bunch of posts that I like to refer to, so I'd have to clean it up a bit.)

  Yes. This is good, and with sufficiently rational behavior it is even better. Enjoying Dominic's riskiness, for good or bad, and Welexi's near cynicism.

  Are the World building tales canon? And are they needed for story understanding (great casual exposition btw am liking the small bits all over the place)

  ALSO EDIT: What the heck is up with Lost City? [Spoiler](#s "were those 2 men erased, or their 2 dozen men? or did the timeline split to 2 men on one side and 18 on other, which later became 15?")
  ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    The World Building stuff isn't related at all - it was just the last thing posted to the site. All those are standalone. I need to go into Wordpress and change around how Previous Post works, I think ...
    ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    [Lost City](#s "The city of let's-call-it Potyr gets erased from existence. Discrepancies are noted, and a commission is formed to get to the bottom of it. Lots and lots of evidence is compiled. Whoever removed Potyr starts removing people from the commission, one by one, until there are only two left - that's where the story begins. These two figure things out, and set to work trying to leave behind evidence. They know that the antimemetic weapon is bad with art - it will change words, but it can't rewrite a poem, so obvious rhymes are left in place. Once that's done, they're both erased from existence by these same unknown forces. A second commission is started, though no one is aware that it's actually the second one because the first one has been erased. Someone finds the poem of warning but discards it, realizing only later that it's evidence of the first commission. And given that the weapon was able to remove (at least) two people from inside the capital, and only after they had learned the truth and made their notes about it, and that the end result was still a war against another country, this means that the weapon was actually used as a false flag attack of some kind - meaning that the person with ultimate control over the weapon might be the person that you'd want to report this finding to.")

    This was meant to be a puzzle story, where you could figure these things out, but I didn't have a sufficient pool of people to calibrate puzzle difficulty against. Also, it was written ages ago - I think I could probably do better now.

  Woot~! So excited! Don't spend the dollar a month I am giving you all in once place.
  ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    Thanks for the support! And I promise that I will earmark that dollar for two separate transactions.

  This is incredibly good.

  The idea of fame directly converting to raw power, but practice (and intelligence I assume) being used to 'finesse it' is very intriguing. Obviously as we've seen here, a little finesse and unexpected action can allow someone with no power to finish off someone at the height.

  So, of course my next thought just based on the powers seen so far is "If Welexi can create one-shot kill lightsabers that work on the most powerful foes, and those can be wielded by relatively normal people, why doesn't he make 20 and have a set of Ionion Hetaroi style companions to wield them?"

  While a famous person with one powerset is certainly strong, a famous *team* who creatively uses their powers together is potentially unbeatable. Each strength to all, each weakness covered by a friend's strength.

  That was what made Weaver so deadly in Worm, she knew how to combine people and powers creatively.

  At any rate, I'll certainly be following this. I'm going to give you money as well.

    Thanks for the support, and glad you enjoyed it - hopefully the answers to the questions this first chapter raises will satisfy.

  ```
  THIS IS AWESOME.
  Yes. Yes. Yes.
  I'm watching this.

  ```
  This is possibly the best excuse I've ever seen for turning a protagonist into an Obi-Wan. Great first chapter.

  squeee alexanderwales has a blog full of writing!
