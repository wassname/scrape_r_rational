  And when the omnibenevolent Angels ruled the Universe, the Goddess of Cancer stepped out of the heart of a dying star, and she spread her crab-claws wide, and she said:

  >KILL CONSUME MULTIPLY CONQUER

  And they did

    And they had.

  Nick Land's denouncement of this piece pretty much sums up my thoughts on it.

    I'm having trouble understanding his criticism. Is it important to understand [this article](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.01561v1.pdf), which he references to describe the forward vision problem?

    Is his main point that continuing replicator selection means that you continue the Goddess of Cancer's cycle?

      His fundamental message is, "ignore Gnon at your own peril". Myopic thinking is just one of the weaknesses of such a system - good luck optimizing the universe to reject evolution in favour of omnihedonism, without a single Darwinian creature surviving to abuse it - your optimizer is probably just as likely to become one in the process. That takes the idea of ignoring Gnon to a whole new level. And remember, it only takes one Darwinian to reduce omnihedonism back down to a murder-eat-fuck rat race. It's just not a stable position in any way.

        This, by the same author as above, shows the author's opinions on GNON. From what little I've seen of Nick Land, he doesn't seem to believe the orthogonality thesis, am I wrong about that?

          wat.  How.

        Except that "Gnon" is just causality.  You can believe causality is Lawful Neutral, and as far as we know, that's scientifically true.  You can believe causality is True Good, and as far as we know, that's total bullshit.

        Nick Land believes causality is Chaotic Evil, which is so nonsensical I can't even comprehend how he arrived to that view.

  This is a very interesting take. I like how Scott manages to start with humans being created by the evil deity (a traditional no-go trope in myth) and still ends with an optimistic story.

  The funniest thing about this is by far the first few comments, which ... really seem like they're sucking up.

  >So you wrote the Transhumanist Myth of Creation this time :-) It is so beautifulâ€¦

  >I thought my sense of awe had died sometime back. Simply beautiful.

  Aaaaalright, guys.

    I like my personal, very very vague creation story:

    >In the beginning, there was nothing. And, it would have been rather boring, except that there was no concept of rather boring. So it would have been just kind of nice, if there was a just kind of nice. And this was the state of not-things for an infinite amount of not-time. And then something happened, because, after an eternity of nothing, something was bound to happen eventually. And the only thing that could happen at that point was everything, and so everything did.

        ```
        All Hail Discordia.
        ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        Full of mischief.
