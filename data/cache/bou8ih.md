## Can you help me brainstorm and design two DnD spells I'm trying to homebrew? (Summon Evil Twin and the Spell of Time Turning)

### Post:

Hi! I would like to add a Time Turner and [Precisely Bound Demons](https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2y56qg/precisely_bound_demons_and_their_behavior/) spells to my DnD game, so I'm trying to clarify their descriptions to make sure they are not overpowered, and lead to fun creative gameplay ideas and implications, without breaking the game. Can you help me out? 

**Summon Evil Twin**

You create a copy of yourself with the identical skills and powers, but the polar opposite personality/goals/values. It must obey your direct commands word for word, but will do it's best to foil your plans. You can give it one command per turn(or specify it during the summoning). The evil twin is played by the DM.

**Spell of Time-Turning**

You send yourself and everything you're wearing/holding (everything within a certain radius?) exactly one hour back in time. To avoid paradoxes, the universe has only one stable self-consistent self-correcting timeline  - everything that players have already observed is "set in stone" and will happen exactly as it did, but you can influence anything that happened off-screen.

For example if you get ambushed, you can't go back in time and warn yourself about the upcoming danger(because you didn't meet your future self before the ambush), but you can send for help or set up traps for the enemies.

Do these spells make sense? Are they overpowered? How can I improve them to make sure they lead to fun and challenging gameplay and a lot of awesome creative ideas? How would you use/exploit/munchkin them?

Edit: I wanted to add one more spell:

**Open Portal**

Works exactly like portal gun from the portal game. You open two 10-feet wide portals on any surface within 120 feet you have a line of signt to.

  *Summon Evil Twin* will grind your game to a halt unless your players are very supportive about Rule 0. You (and your players) be trying to adjudicate (and argue about) wish-like clever phrasing **every turn while in combat**. 

  &#x200B;

  *Spell of Time-Turning* is a 9th level spell, most likely. It sounds like a lot of fun, but I would have in mind a reason for it to be temporary, since "I teleport home and bring everyone I know to the fight" is a pretty funky mechanic. Meanwhile, it is non-paradoxical for a player to announce , "I arrive from an hour in the future and tell myself everything that happens in this dungeon," as long as in an hour they remember to do so. But Divination spells are already broken so maybe it's fine?

  &#x200B;

  *Open Portal* is pretty great. 5th level probably? You've got two sessions before someone reroutes a river into a dungeon or castle – the solution to this is elevation changes within the dungeon to stop water flow.

    What this guy said.  


    Summon evil twin with precise wording will make players waste a lot of time.  Also it is overpowered, you are giving yourself double action for the whole fight. Not so bad if you are playing 3.5 where high level fights are bullshit and losing one full action (not one turn cause only n00bs have one full action a turn in 3.5 high levels) could make sense.  


     *Spell of Time-Turning*  Players will create pardoxes. They will try to make them no matter what even just to see how the DM reacts.  


    Open Portal. I would say it is fine, but be prepared with dungeons and castles being destroyed by it (Players do not even need to be original, just rip Portal 2 ending: portal to the moon)
    ```

  - u/IICVX:
    ```
    Honestly I'd allow *Open Portal* as a reskin of *Dimension Door*, if you add some caveats. I'd put in that one portal must be on a surface within five feet of yourself, and it can only transmit a total of 2x your carry weight before the portal collapses. 

    It's got a bit more tactical utility than DD (you can pull someone out of danger from range, or get rid of a monster that's right next to you), but a bit less strategic utility (you can no longer teleport blind).
    ```

  - u/Sonderjye:
    ```
    I don' think that it would take that long to give commands to the evil twin. Tell it outside of combat that it's supposed to follow your orders in the way it thinks that you intended for it.   


    Also, don't make slaves.
    ```

    - u/GET_A_LAWYER:
      ```
      It's not that giving commands takes time. The time consuming part is the DM figuring out how to corrupt the command, the players deciding the DM's interpretation is invalid, then the inevitable arguments.
      ```

      - u/Sonderjye:

        Good point.

    >  "I arrive from an hour in the future and tell myself everything that happens in this dungeon," as long as in an hour they remember to do so.

    And they are alive and have a suitable spell slot to cast it. I suggest to address the possibility of them failing to do so with something like "this creates a paradox that then opens up a rift between planes and some time demon or something comes out". So your punishment for getting it wrong is a straightforward "fight this horrible monster" rather than "let's reset the whole last hour of play".

  Evil Twin: Can I give you a suggestion?

  Caster (distracted by the Problem At Hand): Sure, go ahead.

  Evil Twin: *casts Suggestion* Tell me to do whatever I want.

      That's where I got the specific phrasing from, yeah, but an Evil Twin with mind magic is still legitimately terrifying.

  **Summon Evil Twin:** 

  This is really vulnerable to munchkinry, and it's not hard to get around the downsides. 

  Is the evil twin affected by copies of all the spells affecting you? Depending on how the targeting works you could cast Dominate Person on yourself beforehand or use a similar effect to force yourself, and by extension your evil twin, not to be evil.

  Does the evil twin appear with equipment? If so, they can use consumable items recklessly and cast spells with expensive material components for you at no cost. If they appear without equipment, that's a lot more bookkeeping and it removes the ambiguity of which one is the twin. 

  The evil twin can be given suicidal orders, which means you can use them to activate abilities and cast spells that would be too costly to you to use otherwise. For example, in 5e an evocation wizard could have their twin cast spells and use overchannel every turn at no cost to themselves, and an evil twin's castings of wish, while dangerous, might not come at the cost of using up the original's three wishes.

  Also, what happens to the evil twin of someone like a Cleric, Paladin, or Druid, whose abilities are at least partly tied to their beliefs and morality?

  I'd make this spell similar to Simulacrum, so give it a permanent duration and have the twin appear without any spells prepared for the day, ongoing spells on them, or any equipment. That cuts down on some of the most obvious tricks. Giving the caster and twin a negative level each might also help the balance.

  Alternatively, if you want Precisely Bound Demons, why not just include some literal demons that have been precisely bound, and let the players find the item used to issue commands? That way you get around a lot of problems, in particular the issue of players disputing how the evil version of their character would respond to their character's orders.

  **Spell of time turning:**

  Wish can change the outcome of a single roll that happened last round. Time stop, the closest time magic I can think of, has a duration of rounds. Compared to these, I think making this 9th level and going back 1 minute, rather than 1 hour, would be of similar power.

  Also, the restriction on stable time loops could be easy to get around with spells like Modify Memory and illusions, if you just need to convince your past selves that what they saw was real.

  **Open Portal:**

  D&D is not a good physics engine. I'd suggest instead describing existing spells and effects in terms of how they work with portals. Feather fall? Produce a portal below them that's linked to ground level as soon as they start falling. Reverse gravity? You're juggling people with portals so they're constantly falling. Telekinesis? You're using portals to produce the same effects. Classes that already use a lot of teleportation effects would be a good starting point.

    Command the Evil Twin to not speak, except as necessary to carry out directions. Direct them to cast the spell "Evil Twin".

      So the Evil Evil Twin is actually a Good Twin. Then gang up 2v1 and kill the Evil Twin.

    Thank you for the amazing reply! A lot of good points, I'll try to tweak the spells to make them less overpowered.

  You should probably specify what happens in-world if players using the Time Turner spell try to do something that creates a paradox, either wilfully or by accident. Suppose they try to go back and warn themselves anyway: are they prevented from moving close enough to their past selves by an intangible barrier? Do they just find themselves unable to maintain the will to keep walking in the direction of their past selves, and compelled to walk away as their past selves approach? Or does fate intervene in a way that seems like an accident?

  Evil twin - lvl 6 and shares your spell pool. If he casts a spell it uses a spell from your spell pool. If you die, he becames you. Duration...minute/lvl ?

  Spell of time turning - just no. Perhaps for a villian. No on players. Max level spell for a villian, usable once per week. Chance of pulling heroes close to villian into the time loop.

  Open portal - cool spell, it would be cooler as a new class feature.  Duration round/lvl - about lvl 4.

    ```
    Add dimension door stuff into Open portal. Weight restriction and not portaling into solid rock, and things like that.
    ```

  The simplest way to handle time travel is the save/load version.  When you go back in time, everything that happened within the last hour is undone except your memories, your mind/soul return to your body wherever it was one hour ago, there is no second copy of you, history begins recording from where you left off and does not have to do the same thing as it did the last time, you do not have to travel back in time a second time at the end of an hour.

  This is not how Harry Potter time turners work, but is much more sane and consistent.

  Note that if you do it this way you will want to have just their minds travel back (and maybe health/spells/experience) but prevent them from duplicating items.

  Summon evil twin seems overpowered if you can just summon it in combat and give it one command per turn, as you can just literally specify which target it attacks and which skill it uses on it.  I would suggest having this be a more long-term thing where you have to give it vague directions that can lead it for multiple turns.  Maybe you have to give it all of its commands in advance as soon as you summon it, like "kill all of my enemies", which then is vulnerable to the DM misinterpreting what an "enemy is", so to be safer you might say "kill every goblin near me" if you're in a combat where the enemies are only goblins, which backfires if there are friendly goblins, or you want to take prisoners, or a boss that isn't a goblin shows up.

  So either you can only give it commands at the beginning of the summon, or once every so long,  A more extreme version is if you're making the evil twin be part of an artifact, you could have the evil twin be a permanent member of the party that is always following them.  Maybe it has a list of commands that it's following, so you need to have them be general enough to govern its everyday behavior, but you can only add, remove, and modify commands at sunrise or whenever you get new spells.  This way, if players make a mistake and the evil twin is exploiting a loophole players have to restrain it rather than being able to instantly modify the command to stop it.  This also prevents the players from spending several minutes out of game arguing about the perfect command in a round of combat that's supposedly 6 seconds.  Players only give commands during a long rest period, when it makes sense for the character to have a long time to think of something.

  In any case, I would suggest both of these to be a legendary artifacts that cast that spell, rather than something any caster can learn. They're kind of really powerful if used right, and so you want to control how many times the players can cast them, and explain why the bad guys aren't using them to do the same things.  A world in which any sufficiently strong caster can time travel would have soooooo many differences.  Every sufficiently rich and powerful person or group, especially kings and millitaries, would have as many casters who could use this spell as possible, and you would need to figure out how to handle bad guys anticipating your heroe's every move (especially since you yourself can't time travel).  A legendary artifact shuts all of that down and gives an excuse for only the players to have this power.

  > Summon Evil Twin

  Reminds me of Ice Assassin, but I suppose that would be someone else's evil twin.

  You could just order your Evil Twin to summon another Evil Twin. Which would be good (or whatever your alignment is), and also is the first step to having a massive army. It seems OP.

  > everything that players have already observed is "set in stone" and will happen exactly as it did, but you can influence anything that happened off-screen.

  You could cast Modify Memory on yourself to trick out time. Or erase your own memory before you go back, so you don't have any memories to contradict and anything could happen.

  > Works exactly like portal gun from the portal game. You open two 10-feet wide portals on any surface within 120 feet you have a line of signt to.

  I'd add that it must be unobstructed even by transparent objects, so you can't open one end to the bottom of the lake. Though there's so many other ways to abuse that it seems pointless.
  ```

- u/DXStarr:
  ```
  For Time Turning: the spell fails if it leaves evidence that time travel happened.

  The player has to make the altered timeline look like "just ordinary good luck," or the spell fails.

  That is, "the spell fails without effect, unless the altered timeline looks to all current and subsequent intelligent observers like something that happened without time travel, and with no more than an ordinary level of coincidence or strangeness."

  So it's on the player, not the DM, to avoid paradox. What's more, it's on the player to basically justify everything they set up in the altered past as something that could have happened without time travel anyway. And the more the opponents might suspect this spell, or just employ divination/detection in general, the less the player can get away with.

  Thus the caster has to be very sneaky in the past, and make sure that everything that does happen... is something that could have, well, "just happened."

  So it becomes retroactive luck, instead of something that lets you make the impossible happen. Because if anyone in the future is going to think "that makes no sense! it's too coincidental, too weird! how could that happen?" -- then the spell fails in the first place.

  Open Portal already exists in 5e DnD, it's a 6th level spell called Arcane Gate.
