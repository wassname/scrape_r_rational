  TV:

  [The Good Place](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4955642/) is, well, good. It's managed to be both funny and surprising going into the second season, and I strongly recommend it.

  I've been watching a little bit of [Into the Badlands](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3865236/) recently, and while I can't recommend it on the merits of the plot, the fight scenes are quite nice for a TV show.

  [Lucifer](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4052886/) is still funny, though it seems to have lost a little bit of drama going into the third season (in particular, I think they're drawing out the "Lucifer reveals the truth to the detective" arc too much).

  Which Star Treks are good? I've been watching the Orville, which has seemed alright, if slightly underwhelming, and I'm not sure if that's because it's legitimately an average show, or because I'm not the target audience. I haven't watched a whole lot of Star Trek (the "save the whales" movie, *Into Darkness*, and *Darmok*), so I was wondering if anyone had recommendations for which movies/TV series/episodes to people would recommend for comparison.

  Books:

  It's a long way from new, but I would strongly recommend [A Deepness in the Sky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Deepness_in_the_Sky) to any fan of science fiction. It's my favorite work in the genre, and I think it works well either on its own or as a prequel to [A Fire Upon the Deep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Fire_Upon_the_Deep).

  I wouldn't generally recommend [The Dagger and the Coin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dagger_and_the_Coin) series because it's rather dry, but I think this sub in particular would appreciate fantasy that's more focused on economics and philosophy.

    > I wouldn't generally recommend The Dagger and the Coin series because it's rather dry, but I think this sub in particular would appreciate fantasy that's more focused on economics and philosophy.

    I'll second your mild recommendation for *The Dagger and the Coin*, and add that *The Long Price Quartet* (starting with *A Shadow in Summer*) by the same author is very good, and I found it to be even more in line with this sub, with themes of existential risk, and alien intelligence in addition to the generally good plotting and scheming.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      Thirded. Also agree that the Long Price Quartet is even better (although the writing starts out not amazing, it does get a lot better as the series goes on). I'm a huge fan of Daniel Abraham so I'd recommend anything he's written, even the urban fantasy (Black Sun's Daughter) and of course the Expanse series.
      ```

  - u/artifex0:
    ```
    > Which Star Treks are good

    I recommend starting with the middle seasons of The Next Generation.  The original series is fun, but can occasionally be cheesy by modern standards.  Voyager, Enterprise and the first season of TNG could be anywhere from decent to painful depending on the episode.  A lot of people like DS9, but it's a departure from, and in some cases a deconstruction of Roddenberry's formula of peaceful, heroic exploration and extremely secular optimism, so I don't think I'd recommend it as a starting point.

    Mid-series TNG, though, holds up well.  The writing is smart, the characters are likable, the effects still look decent, and it's probably the best example of the kind of idealistic themes the series is famous for.
    ```

      > I recommend starting with the middle seasons of The Next Generation.

      Seconded.

      > A lot of people like DS9

      I'm one of those, and I'm also the first to admit it's very different from the others. Mostly in that it has an identifiable plot arc, rather than just continuity. But it really doesn't fit into the pattern of the rest of Trek. I see TOS, TNG, and Voyager as forming an irresistible progression. Kirk the explorer, Picard the diplomat, Janeway the warrior. Diplomacy from weakness, equality, and strength.
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        But Janeway is in a weak position in almost every episode...
        ```

    - u/SevereCircle:
      ```
      I'm a big fan of DS9. The characters are the most interesting, IMHO. It also has an interesting accidental theme of how bizarre it would be if a religion were true, if gods physically existed in the world.

      PS: Season 1 Bashir is the *worst* but he gets better.
      ```

      - u/Frommerman:
        ```
        I don't think that theme was accidental at all.
        ```

    Seconding the recommendation for The Good Place, it's worth watching twice :)
    ```

    - u/N0_B1g_De4l:
      ```
      Yep! I just rewatched the first season, and I definitely caught stuff I hadn't before, and there are some subtle (or not-so-subtle) callbacks.

    > I haven't watched a whole lot of Star Trek (the "save the whales" movie, Into Darkness, and Darmok)

    If you haven't watched [The Undiscovered Country](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102975/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1), you are missing out.

  Any suggestions for stuff I can read to my 7yo son/5yo daughter? It turns out there is a huge dearth of rational YA/J fiction. I've been reading them stuff that I loved as a kid, but even books that I remember being great just don't hold up very well to my adult eyes.
  ```

  - u/Iconochasm:
    ```
    Take the opposite approach.  Read them the conventional greats.  Let them fall in love with all the tropey goodness while they're too young for cynicism.  Introduce them to the rational stuff when they're a bit older, so they can appreciate the deconstructions because they'll understand the context.  That age is excellent to start them on Harry Potter.  Then, in 10 years, show them MoR.
    ```

    - u/pleasedothenerdful:
      ```
      Fair enough, although we've already done the first few Harry Potter books, and I'm holding off on the latter half of the series, as I think it's a little dark for them just yet. I recently tried some Discworld (which are some of my favorites), but they're a bit young for those yet and didn't really take to them like I'd hoped. My son liked it at least, but it was a bit slow for his taste, and all the puns and references go over his head. Part of the problem might also have been my bored daughter's constant interruptions. Still, my policy is that if they don't actively want me to read it to them, we find something else to read.

      Maybe I'm just getting ahead of myself. Still, it'd be nice if there were a few more level 1 intelligent characters in juvenile fiction.

    Have you tried Roald Dahl? His books are what got me into reading.  I still think about the Henry Sugar short story on a regular basis. Come to think about it, that story probably got me into meditation as well.

      Good idea, I loved him when I was a kid.

  - u/InfernoVulpix:
    ```
    For a significant part of my childhood, up to and including high school years, my dad read the Riftwar Cycle to us after supper.  The first saga is about Midkemia, a relatively normal fantasy world, as it gets invaded by the Tsurani, humans from another planet who found their way to Midkemia through rift technology and desired the natural resources Midkemia has.  The first trilogy is about Pug, an orphan in a relatively minor holding who gets apprenticed to the local magician and eventually gets wrapped up in the war.

    The world comes across as surprisingly fleshed out, which is a result of Midkemia being a world the author used for roleplay.  He had a rule that to participate you had to add one thing to the world, be it a place or a historical figure or a species, and once he made Midkemia into a setting for a story there were tons of elements scattered around with no grand purpose for the plot behind them, making them feel that much more authentic when you come across them.

    As the story goes on and you enter new trilogies, you find that decades may have passed and the exploits of main characters a trilogy or two ago are the stuff of legends.  When the master sailor is forced to brave the most dangerous of waters in what amounts to creative suicide and *succeeds*, people talk about it books later.

    Of course check them out yourself before reading them to your children, but this was a formative series for me and while it's been quite a while since I read those first books I highly recommend them.
    ```

    - u/AurelianoTampa:
      ```
      I agree that the series (especially the beginning ones and the co-authored trilogy on Kelewan) were great. Also extremely formative for me - Laurie's speech on what love means in the second book (or second half of *Magician*) is still one I quote today to explain my feelings on the matter. But I can't imagine having a parent read some parts of the first book out loud to a young child. That scene with Pug and Carline in the tower before he leaves? Gets a bit too steamy for ages 5-7...
      ```

      - u/InfernoVulpix:
        ```
        You know, I completely forgot about that until just now, but yeah, with that in mind it'd probably be best to wait a few years first.  I don't know exactly how old I was when we started the series but I'm pretty sure that scene mostly went over my head.

        Ah well, that at least gives a few years to maybe read the series on their own before deciding, but I kinda feel like even if they read it to them now or soon it wouldn't traumatize the kids or anything since (if I'm remembering right, please correct me if I'm wrong since this *was* a long time ago) most of the content in question is subtleties that the kids will just not catch in the first place.

        edit: also now that I think about it my dad had a tendency to censor what he was reading at times because he doesn't like swearing or other words like that, so in retrospect my impressions of the writing style could've been significantly different from what it actually was.

          Oh I agree. They probably just won't understand what's going on. I think I read the series around... 12?... and I definitely had a better grasp of what was happening.
          ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    You might like *Augie and the Green Knight*, though I'm not entirely sure what the age range for it is, and it's pretty short (not a long read like *The Hobbit*, which was our go-to when I was a kid).

  [When In Doubt, Obliviate](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6635363/1/When-In-Doubt-Obliviate) - Gilderoy Lockhart adopts Harry as a publicity stunt. It's really funny and has great characterization of Lockhart as competent schemer and opportunist.

    Sounds good, but is it finished?

    Edit: Nevermind, I figured out what that Status field at the top of every chapter of Fanfiction.net stories is for.

    Edit edit: Yes, it's complete.

    Edit edit edit: It was fun and enjoyable. I won't say it was incredible, but it was well done (overlooking a few minor typos, grammatical errors, and revision errors that resulted in garbled sentences, but those were not distractingly frequent). The highlight is the characterizations and their interactions, which are interesting, original (or true-to-the-source-but-intelligent-about-it) and well-executed. The story doesn't have a huge amount of dramatic tension (as most of the dangers from the original content are fairly easily navigated by cautious, intelligent characters who actually think about their situations for a moment instead of being Gryffindors), but the story is interesting, the dialogue is both good and often amusing, and a number of fun, light-hearted shots are taken at the tropes of the original series. It was definitely worth the read.

  Anyone got something good from the new anime season? I'm less than impressed with the summaries, honestly.
  ```

  - u/GlueBoy:
    ```
    Have you tried Made in Abyss? It starts off nice and idyllic but by the end its one gut punch after another. Episode 11 and 13 was tough to get through, made me tear up. First time in a long time with an anime. And the art is amazing.
    ```

    - u/crivtox:
      ```
      I second that. Made in abyss is good and, at for this season( assuming they make more seasons, otherwise I'll read the manga) , it seems to have good and consistent worlbuilding. Also it seems that the kids are going to have to be smart( and lucky) to survive instead of being given  power ups .The anime seems a lighthearted  shounen first , because of the art stile and other reasons , but then things start to happen, like that the training montage that is obviously not enough to make a significant difference    , doesn't make a significant difference,( I mean it's difficult to measure how useful it was and it probably helped, but what I mean is that it wasn't ussed as an excuse to make them  extremely more competent )and then chapters10-13 happen.

  So yesterday I bought [*Every Heart a Doorway*](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EveryHeartADoorway), and ended up more-or-less reading it in one night and morning.

  If an intellectual thing can be a mindfuck, this thing is a feelsfuck.  *Damn.*

  Without spoiling, it's *dark*.  Like, it takes what ought to be a whimsical magic-boarding-school genre and turns it into regular emotional knife-twists and serial killing.  It made me sympathize with the characters even when I was judging them for basically being doubly-abused children with a measure of Stockholm Syndrome, and then it started hurting them *more*, and then it would give little narration details that made it *even worse*.

  Or maybe I've just read enough Discworld to immediately compare what happened in *this* book to the Queen of the Elves, and see a level of darkness that wasn't even there.

  Or maybe my real problem is that I've been repeatedly torn away from my roots in life and *am* my inner child, so I empathize with the characters *much* too easily.

    The Waves Arisen is a complete fanfic that came out in early 2015 by someone with no web presence under that name before or since.

        There is definitely a *lot* of thematic overlap. My 40% non-Yudkowsky space in part represents my subjective estimate for "this is so EY that it feels redundant with his other stuff, to the point where I could write a long post detailing all the similarities, and so another person wrote it" (which obviously got a complexity penalty). But I still think it is more likely he wrote it than not.
        ```

        - u/alexanderwales:
          ```
          Part of the reason I think you might want thematic redundancy like that is either if you're A) a somewhat polarizing figure or B) you want to create a feeling of false consensus. That is, if you are the kind of guy that a lot of people seem to have a hate boner for, you could write under a pseudonym in order to reach those people, who might not otherwise give your work the time of day. And similarly, you might want to trick people into thinking "oh, well authors A, B, and C think that" because that will cause them to weight whatever you wrote about higher (this is one of the primary reasons that people on the internet use sockpuppets).
