  New chapter is up, after a long, long time in the works. There seems to be some problem with FF.net putting the chapter up, so if the link doesn't work for you please refer to the [AO3 mirror](https://archiveofourown.org/works/14091411/chapters/66821785).

    Thank you for posting the mirror, I was having trouble with the Fanfiction link.

    Also, this chapter made me really want to see the next chapter, and as always, thank you for writing this!

      You're welcome! Yeah, FF.net just seems to be derping out, I tweeted Fictionpress asking about it but no answer for now. At worst I'll just try deleting and reposting the chapter.

  I don't get what Shen's plan is here, is he trying to get into a position to undermine his brother in ways that don't involve a direct confrontation or is he trying to get into a good position with the instruments under the assumption that Piccolo is going to come back regardless of what happens? That doesn't seem like it's going to work out for him.

  From a meta perspective I'm glad we're bringing together at least some of the main characters again. All the hopping around makes it hard to remember what was going on where without having to click back to the previous few chapters (though the delay between chapters also kind of isn't helping here, it'll probably be a lot easier to follow on a reread).

  Awesome chapter as always! Really looking forward to seeing how the fight between Goku and Tao Pai Pai ends up going.

    Hes maneuvering for influence in a completely self interested way without a fixed plan. Its selfish but kinda rational.
    ```

    - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
      ```
      Yeah, remember that first time around he was the "please spare me master Piccolo, I'll help you" guy. He's just trying to assess the situation and weasel his way into a position where he saves his own skin.
      ```

  Great chapter, as always!

  Biting my nails waiting to know about the fight between Goku and Tao Pai Pai. It's great how this chapter made me lose hope about it little by little then gave some of it back at the end. Good job :)

  Great chapter, I was fully invested the whole way and now I crave for more, as usual
