## r/Charmed

### Post:

I've only read rational fanfiction and never written one. I would love to hear everyone's feedback. I found it so bothersome that Charmed fans can't appreciate both iterations without judging what it means to be a Charmed fan. It was always about sisterhood, bonding, friendship, love, featuring sexy women. So why not?

Please be kind to me. :)

Martin Adela.

I was so inspired by r/Animorphs that I had to do one for my favorite genre.

Here is the link, ya'll: [https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13858289/1/We-Sisters-Three](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13858289/1/We-Sisters-Three)

If you're not familiar with either iterations, I do recommend you to watch it but you don't have to as I'm planning on a slow burn that will turn the Charmed legend on its head.

Cheers. I hope you enjoy and please feel free to be honest with me but gentle because I'm still learning about this genre but I enjoy it as they are always the best reads.

  Thank you all for your kind, insightful words. I really appreciate knowing there's an audience that is enjoying my story at face value. I posted the first chapter and probably won't get back to this until sometime this week, but I do hope you are enjoying. 

  Healthy conversations about urban fantasy/magical realism are my favorite. Charmed was very much so that show for me. 

  Cheers.

  Having watched the original and a few episodes of the new, my main problem with the new is that it's *overflowing with woke*, thereby making it have a very different tone/feel from the original.

    I hear what you are saying but I dig the new Charmed because it does hit the marks with the nostalgic feeling. I think their first season, they were trying a little too hard but it's nice to see them working in multi-season arcs and taking things a little slower. The problem with the original is that it kept trying to reinvent itself and wandered off into Sillyville. 

    As a fan of both, just my thoughts. 

    Cheers,

  It's ben a long, long time since I watched any of that show, so I barely remember anything beyond the premise.

  And there isn't really much here yet to critique, so I'm going to reserve judgement, beyond one note:

  >an ancient line of magic practitioners from Salem

  I know that's part of the original show's mythology, so I'm not going to blame you if you keep it, but this is a [trope](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SalemIsWitchCountry) that really annoys me. Part of what makes the Salem Witch Trials so despicable is that the accusations that got people killed were completely unsubstantiated, and putting real witches into historical Salem undermines that.

  Again, this is directly from the show, so I understand if you want to keep it.  And there are some opportunities there to do something clever and yet respectful to the victims of the original Witch Trials.  But just be mindful that this trope can be very problematic if used carelessly.

    As opposed to what?  The actual completely valid witch hunts that caught witches using their magic powers?  

    It sounds like you're just saying that he shouldn't be allowed to make a story where witches are real at all.  

    If you're making an urban fantasy story that says that witches are real, then *anywhere* known for witches that you name has a history of which hunts.  There were tens of thousands, and not just limited to one city in the US.

      I guess having witches come from a place known for the brutal injustice against people accused of witchcraft kind of makes light of that brutal history.

      It might be kind of like people centuries from now jokingly referencing modern police brutality.

      I personally don't have a problem with the Salem witch thing, but I can see why someone might if their personal experiences cause them to relate heavily to those victims.

        No need to wait for centuries, pretty sure that Charlie Hebdo or someone did it already.

        I think the objection is beside the point anyway. Imagine that witchcraft is real, and people executed for it were actually witches; does it make executions any more justified? Not in the slightest, I'd say. It doesn't make that history any better or lighter. And from the story perspective, if you have a story set in a world "exactly like ours, but also with magic", it's logical that places associated with magic in our world will have established magical traditions in that one.

          >Imagine that witchcraft is real, and people executed for it were actually witches; does it make executions any more justified?

          Well, that depends on what the witches were doing, doesn't it?

          Historically, witches have been accused of causing infertility, blight, drought, plague, birth defects, and all other hosts of things.  If someone, by their very presence, is wreaking death and destruction throughout your community, letting them continue to live among you isn't really a good option, and exiling them is just outsourcing the sorrow to someone else.

          Part of the problem I'm having composing a reply to u/Xachariah's question is that the idea of a "good witch," in the sense that J.K. Rowling or L. Frank Baum wrote about them, is historically new.  At the times and in the places that witch trials like the one in Salem happened, there were only two sources for supernatural power: either you were a saint working miracles in God's behalf, or you got your power from Satan, and used it to harm people.  So bringing the modern definition of "witch" as "something not necessarily bad" back into the time of the witch trials creates an anachronism, which makes it difficult to bring it back forward again.

          Personally, if I were writing a story from scratch, I'd either avoid the word entirely, or date its use for actual magical practitioners back to no earlier than when it started getting used in a positive sense, or use it as a pejorative, with practitioners preferring a different term but being called "witches" by ignorant mobs.  Likely some combination of the last two, with the "it was used to historically persecute us!" people perpetually annoyed with the "we're reclaiming it!" folks and vice versa.

          But even if I did use the term, If stay the Hell (pun intended) away from places like Salem, because they're **not** "famous for witches:" what they're famous for is the ignorant persecution of innocent people.  And confusing "hunting witches" with "persecuting innocent people" is **exactly the problem**.

          (u/Xachariah, I'm probably not going to compose a separate reply to your own post, as I think the above answers your question about as well as I am able to answer it)

            Well, given this view, isn't a saint basically a "good witch", just by another name? The concept itself of someone using supernatural powers for good is anything but new. In our hypothetical magical world, I could easily imagine people who didn't call themselves saint (either for moral reasons, or because they were known before for un-saintly behavior, or whatever) but wanted to prove with their own example that magic users can be as good as anyone else - only to utterly fail because of overwhelming prejudice. Or knowing that but still not wanting to join the religious lot, and practicing magic secretly.

            I agree completely that the core of the problem was persecuting innocent people, not magic; but I still think it doesn't change anything for our discussion. Let's consider a real life parallel: there were (and still are) lots of conspiracy theories about Jews, accusing them of all possible mortal sins. Nazi Germany was quite (in)famous for putting those theories into practice and persecuting lots of innocent people because of that (it doesn't make Germany "famous for Jews", of course, but if there were only a handful of places in the world where Jews lived, it would be famous for them too); yet I don't see any problems with a story about Jews in contemporary Germany. I *would* see a problem with a story about an evil Jewish conspiracy being uncovered by nazi heroes, but that's not what we were talking about?

              >Well, given this view, isn't a saint basically a "good witch", just by another name? 

              No, because **the source of the power was the point of the name**.  If you called someone a "witch" in Salem in the late 17th century, you were explicitly accusing them of bargaining with Satan for the power to do the things you were also accusing them of doing.

              And "good Satan-worshipper" wasn't exactly a concept that existed back then, either.

              >I don't see any problems with a story about Jews in contemporary Germany.

              Of course not.  But what if those fictional German Jews traced their ancestry in Germany back to the (non-existent in real life, but frequently appearing in Nazi propaganda) Jews who sabotaged Germany's war effort in WWI?  To my mind, that would be a better parallel to a witch tracing their ancestry back to Salem.

                Well, you enter a pact with a supernatural entity, it provides you with power, and you do whatever the entity likes, good for some entities or evil for others. Sounds still conceptually the same to me :)

                Anyway, even if we consider "witch" to be *defined* as "Satan-worshipper". Either it's true in-universe - that's a very different premise from what we have been discussing, and it will preclude us from having "good witches" in our plot either (and I tend to agree that using an IRL place famous for witch trials might not be a good decision for that plot. though Lovecraft had used it, IIRC); or it was a superstition in medieval times, which were plenty IRL as well, and which will be treated in-universe just like other old superstitions are treated IRL.

                > But what if those fictional German Jews traced their ancestry in Germany back to the (non-existent in real life, but frequently appearing in Nazi propaganda) Jews who sabotaged Germany's war effort in WWI?

                If all, or most of the Jews were involved in that conspiracy - this plot would be problematic for the same reason, implying that nazis were right and justified. But if we play around with an idea of a conspiracy... A benevolent Jewish conspiracy spanning the whole world or country: oddly specific and unrealistic, but at least not antisemitic, okay from that point, I guess. A local "good conspiracy" of Jews just helping each other: that's just a normal Jewish diaspora :) Or if we're back to evil conspiracies on a local scale, that would be Jewish mafia, not impossible as well. And imagining a world where such mafia did indeed exist, or there was a couple of high-ranking officials in Germany that secretly worked against it in WWI, which happened to be Jewish - that wouldn't make Holocaust any less horrible or justified by any measure, and contemporary stories about Jews any less appropriate, even if they feature descendants of said officials.

                  Exactly.  You're coming at this with a modern sensibility.  You're not thinking like a colonial Puritan from 17th Century Massachusetts.  And, if your story is just set in the present day, then fine.  Call your magic users "witches" and I have no problem with it.  Heck, have them hail from Salem.  Plenty of modern-day Wiccans there.  It's when you reach into the past and put a modern definition of the word into the minds and onto the lips of people who thought about "witches" very differently that you start encountering problems.

                  >Either it's true in-universe - that's a very different premise from what we have been discussing

                  ...At which point, when the universe is supposed to be basically "Ours, but magic is real," you have to start justifying why colonial Puritans from 17th Century Massachusetts had a different definition of the word "witch" than they did in our own world, and things get sticky.

                  >or it was a superstition in medieval times, which were plenty IRL as well, and which will be treated in-universe just like other old superstitions are treated IRL

                  And yes, I would think that's absolutely fine; it's one of the suggestions I made [a few posts ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/mn8fpr/rcharmed/gty63ku/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3): to "use it as a pejorative, with practitioners preferring a different term but being called 'witches' by ignorant mobs."

                  >If all, or most of the Jews were involved in that conspiracy - this plot would be problematic for the same reason, implying that nazis were right and justified. 

                  Why would numbers make it more problematic?  The parallel is that both sets of fictional, modern-day protagonists would be descended from people who, in our world, were made up to justify the killing of other, innocent people.  Whether you would agree with that justification or not, it's converting lies -- horrible lies, that to a contemporary sensibility, were considered sufficient justification for trial and execution -- and making them truths in the narrative.

                  The whole historical point of the Salem Witch Trials is that **there were no witches in Salem** (also, no witches anywhere else, but that's not as important to the point about Salem).  The entire saga is a lesson we should learn about how petty grudges and paranoia can reach a critical mass and result in a lot of innocent people getting killed. Undermining that point because the town's name is a convenient pop culture reference is just sheer lazy writing.

      - u/Bowbreaker:
        ```
        By that argument no fiction about witches should allude to any Euro-Christian myths, because any use of that makes light of the unwarranted bigotry and massively brutal crimes against people of non-Catholic faiths, users of folk medicine and women in general. Any mention of relationships to horned entities, contact with non-angelic supernatural beings, flight, manifestation of harmful phenomena through non-Christian chants, above average beauty, hook noses, portrayal as unmarried adults, magical sacrifice for personal gain, divination and anything else really is all just bigoted caricature and fear mongering against various real people that were marginalized and oppressed throughout history.
