  I remember that!  Not *quite* as dead as I thought.  Plenty of fun, in a Humanity, Fuck Yeah, Die Xeno Scum way.  Or as the story had it, iirc, 

  **IN THE NAME OF HUMANITY, DIE.  BY MY HANDS BE BROKEN.**
  ```

  Is this interesting to someone who's fairly familiar with 40K but only knows about Evangelion by osmosis? The total of my knowledge is approximately 'Giant Robot Anime deconstruction, the robots are their mothers, they kill angels, Shinji should stop whining about the unexpected harem and get in the fucking robot already.'
  ```

  - u/Anderkent:
    ```
    I'd even say evangelion knowledge is somewhat counterproductive here, because the characterisations aren't exactly on point, and the general 'feel' of the setting is completely different.

    Try it and find out, it is the only way :P

    That's really all you need to know.  In this version, *he gets in the fucking robot.*

  As fun as Shinji & WH40k is, I think I prefer his  [Evangelion/Larry Niven's Known Space crossover](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7065209/1/Study-War-No-More). It's a pity it's unfinished, like with most of his other stories.
  ```

    ```
    I don't know that I'd call this work unfinished.  It's understated and dependant on an understanding  of EVA, but   the only question in a war between Kzin and humanity equipped with AT fields and  is if the Kzin go extinct or are smart enough to surrender at some point.
    ```

    - u/Farmerbob1:
      ```
      I do not remember if it was Niven canon, or from another author's short story in the universe, but at one point humanity met an extremely capable non-scream-and-leap covert operations kzin who was apparently a messenger for the Kzin empire.  He indicated that the Kzin attacking humanity were basically the dregs of fringe nobility, their personnel untrained compared to Kzin official military forces.  They were allowed to attack humanity because the only other way to keep them from causing havoc within the Kzin empire itself would be to engage in civil war.  If humanity pressed an attack against the Kzin empire, all sorts of hell was going to break loose.

      Bluff or reality?

  Never really gripped me, that one. I gave it a solid try but trailed off around the time of the kidnapping
  ```

- u/Kodix:
  ```
  It's neat, but I felt that Shinji got a *bit* too much power for free, just because. I stopped reading when he visits some sort of a monk order that just happens to have ridiculous amounts of extremely useful crystal that only Shinji knows how to use - that was a bit too much for me.
  ```

  - u/XxChronOblivionxX:
    ```
    Yeah that's definitely the point that this story seriously dropped off. It never really gets as tight and compelling in the initial arcs, but it does actually pick up again in the most recent chapters.
    ```

- u/Anderkent:
  ```
  Oh hey, I remember this! From long ago. Starts pretty well, but I think by the later chapters it loses a lot of its momentum. Still a fun read.

  If you like this you might like [thousand shinji](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3946501/1/Thousand-Shinji).

    ```
    The first twelve paragraphs were good, but then the crossover started. I wanted to see a manipulative son of Gendo, not an arbitrarily superhuman wizard. Not to mention that he couldn't even be said to be like Gendo if he actually cared for his master.
    ```

  - u/TerrenceChill:
    ```
    This happens to almost every promising fan fiction tbh. Strong start and weak finish.
    ```

    - u/alexanderwales:
      ```
      I think that happens a lot in fiction generally, it's just that most original fiction has editors to make sure that things stick together (or reject works that don't have a proper finish).
      ```

      - u/AmeteurOpinions:
        ```
        In general it's easier to start a cool idea than continue a cool idea at the same or greater levels of cool. That's why I write backwards, and why I'll never finish anything...
        ```

      - u/TerrenceChill:
        ```
        Yea that makes sense. I'm just a bit burned since a lot of promising fan fictions were never even finished in the first place. I'm still waiting for The Emprahesque to continue. :/
        ```

        - u/redrach:
          ```
          That's the one about the emperor turning into a tarrasque, right? I know the author on IRC, he'll be glad to hear someone's still interested.
          ```

    - u/Anderkent:
      ```
      Eh, not *every* one. It's obviously a selection effect - if it has a weak start, you're likely to drop it quickly (unless it came recommended by someone).
      ```

      - u/TerrenceChill:
        ```
        That's why I said *almost* every one. But you are right of course. it's not like that there aren't fan fics with great endings. I still remember the haunting ending of one of my favorite fan fics:

        [The Metropolitian Man](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10360716/1/The-Metropolitan-Man) A rational fan fiction about Superman.
        ```

    - u/Farmerbob1:
      ```
      Not just Fan Fiction.  Most amateur entertainment writers have this problem.  They get a great idea, and maybe it is legitimately a great idea.  The story carries itself for many chapters, and then the writer realizes they had a great idea, but, uh, how does it end?  Sometimes they just stare at the screen a few days and drop it, sometimes they continue it lamely.  Sometimes, I'm sure, natural instincts supply a solution that's good enough to not be flat.

      I know damn well I'm guilty of exactly that in my earliest writing, and I'm only starting to really understand how writing for entertainment actually *works.*
      ```

      - u/TerrenceChill:
        ```
        All fair points and I agree. I'm working on a story for some years now and it's really hard to give it an ending that naturally flows from the rest of the story.
        ```

        - u/Farmerbob1:
          ```
          A lot of books have been written on how to write a story.  I'd never read any of them, flying by the seat of my pants for over a million words, with hints and minimal guidance from other people.  Then I bought a book about plot and structure - the author doesn't speak in literary mumbo-jumbo (except to poke at it now and then, and draw attention to what the literary jargon actually means), and it really opened my eyes.  I really have high hopes for my next story after Set In Stone, and future Set In Stone books.

          Not going to plug the plot and structure book here, again (I have mentioned it before, but I really feel uncomfortable constantly plugging it publically) but if you want the name of the book, send me a PM.
          ```

  - u/redrach:
    ```
    I liked it at the start, but it gets pretty bad by the end. No credible threats at all, just everyone falling to their hax.
    ```
