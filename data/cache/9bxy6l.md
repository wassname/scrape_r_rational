  ```
  Of the four "sciences" mentioned in the description, one of them isn't a science, one of them probably isn't capable of generating accurate predictions, and they seem to have completely ignored any sort of biology. So, that's a good sign /sarcasm.

  - u/Kelpsie:
    ```
    Bah, biology is just [applied physics](https://xkcd.com/435/) anyway.
    ```

    - u/Amonwilde:
      ```
      And physics is just applied math.
      ```

      - u/causalchain:
        ```
        And math is just applied logic
        ```

        - u/serge_cell:
          ```
          And logic is applied topology (Homotopy type theory).  Loop is closed now.
          ```

          - u/xamueljones:
            ```
            Bah! All of science is just [applied philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_philosophy)!
            ```

            - u/crivtox:
              ```
              All of philosophy its just the output  algorithms running in people's brains .
              So its applied cs.
              Which is just applied math , whith its just applied logic which is just philosophy.
              ```

      - u/willem640:
        ```
        and math is just physics stripped of everything that makes it apply to the real world
        ```

  - u/m1ksuFI:
    ```
    The book is actually really good. You'll have to read it to know what he means.
    ```
