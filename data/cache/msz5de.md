## Hermione Granger and the Silent Country, ch. 9: The Law of the Medes and Persians (part of a Gryffindor!Voldemort AU)

### Post:

The latest chapter, "The Law of the Medes and Persians," can be found [here](https://archiveofourown.org/works/27111157/chapters/75873170). 

TINTF explores a Tom Riddle who, having been sorted into Gryffindor, remains a Dark wizard but (generally) doesn't view his underlings as expendable cannon fodder and, though he would prefer to live forever, is not so afraid of death that he will make rash and ill-advised decisions like splitting his soul almost as soon as he's heard the word "horcrux."

  Aaaaannnnd there it is. Not only has Riddle failed to abolish Azkaban, he has given Dementors human rights. I suppose it remains to be seen whether his claims about their civilizability are true, but I'm not sure why anyone should care. They are literally soul-sucking demons, their goals are diametrically opposed to those of humans, and they create misery by just existing. If summarily executing Nazi death camp guards was justice (to be clear: it absolutely was), then so is starving all the dementors to death, no matter how sentient they may be.

  This Riddle is very clearly still evil, just in more interesting and exciting ways than the original model.

  Remaining mysteries:

  * Why did Riddle want Hermione in the tournament?

  * Is Riddle still the best candidate for screwing with the Goblet given that he does not appear to benefit from this? (Yes, Riddle is always the best candidate)

  * What did Dumbledore see on the night he died which would lead to Riddle's downfall?

  * What is the fate of the House Elves?

  * What is an Eye of Providence?

    I mean, if you could give the Dementors a different diet, that might swing the moral argument in favour of not destroying them all.  Like, if you could create an artificial  [wirehead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wirehead_(science_fiction)) which is sentient but not sapient or or intelligent or conscious, which exists only to create an endless stream of pleasurable memories for Dementors to consume, and the Dementors can (and are willing to) restrict themselves to feeding only on those, then it seems like it's in the same moral category as "vampires willing to feed only on cloned blood."

    That said, except in that very specific scenario, they're a literal embodiment of torture, so yeah, tolerance of other beings can only extend to the point where their existence does not infringe on other people's basic rights (like the right to not be subjected to cruel punishment).

    - u/Frommerman:
      ```
      Agreed. But this Riddle does not appear to have done any of those things.

  - u/callmesalticidae:

    I'm really quite pleased by how the reaction to Riddle's dementor policy runs the full gamut from "this is further proof that Riddle is evil" to "this is a surprisingly good thing that Riddle has done." 

    I can't say whether a solution like what /u/Nimelennar suggests is feasible, and it may be that dementors have needs which just make them inimical to other beings, but I feel like it's cheating a little to say, "We can't coexist with these creatures, but conveniently they aren't people anyway." Riddle and Hermione probably won't be able to sit down for tea and come to a mutually-satisfactory arrangement, but that doesn't mean that Riddle's not a person!

    >Why did Riddle want Hermione in the tournament?


    Cue bono?  
    A Haywood win:  
    If Haywood (or some other magical tryhard psycho duelist from Hogwards) won, this scares the international community. Not in Riddle's interest.  
    A Viktor win:  
    If Viktor wins, the wizard-supremacist gain in reputation.  
    Not in Riddle's interest. In Karkaroff's interest, but he's not a player.
    Very unlikely now, since he's up against two friends, instead of in a Free For All.

    A Fleur win: 
    She's quarter Veela, so the international wizard-supremacist faction loses face. Good for Octobre.  


    A Hermione win:  
    Unlikely, but worst-case for the wizard-supremacists.  
    Also would be good for English-French relations.  
    Also good for Octobre.

    What's in it for Octobre?  
    Octobre benefits, because two of the Candidates are French now and he wants to kill the king.
    Two reasons. His name is Octobre and he doesn't drink coffee.

    He's totally named after the month that saw another most Christian majesty killed. 
    And because he prides himself on his French spirit.
    The French love baguette, fromage and regicide.   


    > I pride myself on my French spirit, but, to my shame, I have never >developed a taste for coffee. In truth, I can hardly abide anything >stronger than water.

    There's an obscure German joke about the French partisan in the Vichy restaurant asked what beverage he wants:

    >"Kaffee oder lieber Tee?"  
    >"LibertÃ©!"

    Also Riddle wins, if Octobre starts the French Wizarding revolution, because that'll make him look reasonable in comparison.
    Hence they're cooperating.
    Octobre probably couldn't have roofied Hermione into putting her name into the goblet otherwise. Or would have known that this would work.

    The dementors don't have a choice though.  Maybe they should be euthanized painlessly if possible but it's not like a Nazi guard. And if they can't be killed, what if starving to death for a dementor is more painful than being fed on by a dementor? Now you can't even make the utilitarian argument, you have to fall back on bodily autonomy.

    Actually, perhaps people could be _paid_ to feed dementors. It does not seem so bad that you couldn't be compensated. Kinda like selling a kidney.
    ```

    - u/Frommerman:
      ```
      I was assuming there was no known way to just kill a dementor in this continuity. If there is a True Patronus here then yeah, use that, but starving them out is the only way to do it in canon. 

      Paying people to be tortured only sounds like a reasonable solution if you think capitalism is good and money representative of anything real. I believe neither. The best case scenario under this plan is marginalized communities selling their souls for bare survival in a far more literal way than they do in real life. Everyone else would have access to better jobs than "dementor food," the wage paid to be tortured would be bottomed out through competition, and you would eventually wind up with Azkaban But Neoliberal This Time.

      It's unfortunate, but when you have an entire race who are literally, verifiably soul-sucking demons (rather than just pervasive lies saying they are, as in antisemitic propaganda), who can't feed on anything but souls, and will starve to death if forced to stop feeding on souls, genocide really is the best option. We wipe out botfly infestations with extreme prejudice, and we would still be justified in doing so if botflies could plead for their lives as we crushed them. Dementors are even more parasitic than that.

        >we would still be justified in doing so if botflies could plead for their lives as we crushed them

        I'm not as sure as you that this is true

        >the best case scenario under this plan is marginalized communities selling their souls for bare survival in a far more literal way than they do in real life.

        Well I think in a lot of ways selling 15 minutes of yourself to dementors is *better* than selling your kidney, as it leads to no permanent damage, and it has the sort of quick feedback loop that no one would ever be tricked into doing it longer than they wanted to - Unlike with kidneys, where the lure of quick money might override good sense. It definitely seems better than working for years in a coal mine and getting lung damage. 

        It had occurred to me that if you successfully implemented Wizard Post-Scarcity Utopia (or even Wizard Welfare State) then perhaps no one would want to sell their time to dementors. Except maybe very kind donors.

        But that's a separate question than whether, *given* that conditions are such that people wish to sell their time to dementors, disallowing them from having the option of being able to make that sale isn't the answer (rather, building the Wizard Welfare State would be the answer).

        In the real world, if you were the dictator, forbidding people from working exploitative jobs wouldn't really work to improve their lot, what you'd have to do is to give them basic income so that they did not *wish* to work the exploitative job. The former would just take away their option to move from terrible to slightly less terrible. I'm a socialist as far as *values* go but this seems like a cause and effect thing.

    bonus mystery: 

    Why did Riddle silence Derrrick?

    >The rebuke could have been a physical blow, the way that Haywood shuddered against it, and she moved almost as if she had been thrown, legs and hands and arms and feet spilling over each other as she withdrew, trying to stand at the same time she was trying to leave the room.

  >determined that you have broken this rule, then you will be barred from participating in the next Task, which will not only trigger the forfeiture clause of the Tournamentâs contract but also put your replacement at a severe disadvantage

  So ask for help and forfeit instantly

  It seems untenable to have two students from one school and one from the other no matter how you look at it. Even for Karkoff every one will know his champion fought against basically just one rival

  Though when you think about it one person beating two others is already not very impressive

  >What is relevant to us now is that, if any student who is selected as their schoolâs champion subsequently chooses to withdraw from the Tournament, or is thrown out of the Tournament for ill behaviour, then the relevant administratorâmyself, in this caseâmust expel that student.

  Except it would be hogwarts who had to expel them, it also seems rather unnecessary to have such harsh rules considering how badly this situation reflects on all three schools publicly

  I also don't understand why anyone would bond themselves with any possibility of having to retire like that over some meaningless games. There's no prize after all.

  But if I was to risk it then I'd step down as headmistress and put some random guy in charge who then expels the student

  Alternatively expel the student and then let them attend anyway, but without grading them or anything. I can go to a university lecturer without being a student, similarly people can go on exchange. I think in the rather ad hoc world of wizards that'd be fine since their education is not as performative as ours

  >, then he might punish Beauxbatons if she left.

  To what benefit? He'd just be harming himself for no gain. It's one thing to threaten to cut off your nose to spite your face it's another thing to go through with it after your face has left or whatever is analogous

  I'm not sure risk of Haywood is such a good reason to stay in, there was already that risk after fleur was chosen, and I still can't see why anyone in charge would be satisfied by this whereas having four competitors is rather different because at least you still had three meaningful champions. Assuming this is riddle I don't see how it benefits him and doesn't he see a systemic issue with his best pupil being so violent which makes me think that he's happy that she did that but then why punish her 

  Since people know about animagus and bugs anyway, certainly I thought Dumbledore could hear anything said in hogwarts. So no privacy I'd say. Similarly couldn't Dumbledore tell when students were injured 

  Glad that Hermy doesn't fall for blackmail and much better than most media

    >Except it would be hogwarts who had to expel them, it also seems rather unnecessary to have such harsh rules considering how badly this situation reflects on all three schools publicly

    Yeah, that's what I'm not getting.  Why wouldn't she be expelled from **Hogwarts**, not Beauxbatons?  She wasn't selected as Beauxbatons' champion.

    The only reading that I can see is that the contract between the headmasters would leave them ineligible to attend any of the other schools.  And you could make that case based on what Riddle said back in chapter seven:

    >If you are chosen, then your only choice will be to walk along the path that is set out for you, or hope that you can find education outside Western Europe.

    It'd be nice if why the obvious solution doesn't apply could be made explicit in-story, though.

    > Except it would be hogwarts who had to expel them

    /u/Nimelennar's theory that Hermione would be banned from all three schools is correct. I was concerned that I was already being too wordy, so I didn't explicitly point it out, but obviously I should've. I've been making a list of minor revisions to make in the next couple weeks, and this is going on it. 

    > Alternatively expel the student and then let them attend anyway, but without grading them or anything. I can go to a university lecturer without being a student, similarly people can go on exchange.

    Hermione will not be permitted on the grounds. It'd be more feasible for her to conduct a series of correspondence courses with her professors that is technically of their own initiative and unrelated to attendance (even remote) at Beauxbatons, but that's not really the point for Hermione. 

    > Even for Karkoff every one will know his champion fought against basically just one rival

    Karkaroff would rather come in first in a two-person contest than second in a three-person contest. 

    > I also don't understand why anyone would bond themselves with any possibility of having to retire like that over some meaningless games. There's no prize after all.

    > I still can't see why anyone in charge would be satisfied by this whereas having four competitors is rather different because at least you still had three meaningful champions.

    I don't want to spoil future events, so I'll just say that all these concerns are things that I've thought about and they will be addressed in the future.

      That seems like a reasonable implementation, you could bring a magic mirror device as alternative to correspondence 

      But yes certainly she cares most about her friends

      >

      Isn't it embarrassing to even be involved in such a tournament? It's like attending Qatar, except there are only four teams going, and Qatar quits and instead Saudi Arabia gets 2 teams instead, would Germany or Brazil still attend? It doesn't reflect very well.

      If there is an actual prize then it matters more. Also since the tournament rules didn't say anything about sabotaging other people (not allowed to help candidates but you can hinder them) then Karkaroff can obliviate Fleur next time he sees her.
