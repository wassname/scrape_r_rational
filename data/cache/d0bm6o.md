  I'm looking forward to Cat realizing that Cordelia has *also* told a Choir to screw off when they offered her a Name. Wonder if we'll find a third character to do the same? Or maybe we'll get some more parallels between the two; they do both get advice from birds, apparently (although Cordelia a little indirectly).

    I'm pretty sure the two mirroring each other is intentional.  Cordelia will probably be hobbling along, same as Cat.  All she needs now is for someone to stuff Balthazar's soul into a cape.
    ```

      ```
      They need to start heckling the Hierarch during the negotiations about how they actually followed through on their principles and rejected the Names.
      ```

  ```
  Black and Scribe feel like terrible parents coming to tell the kids they spent the rent payment on an attempted coup... *again*.
