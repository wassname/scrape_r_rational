    I could hear the laugh track running in the background during each „subtle“ reference.

    The only thing missing was Rain shouting „Bazinga“ while explaining something.

    ```
    "Pop" culture references.
    ```

- u/MetaphorKnot:
  ```
  AFAICT by scrolling through, there's no new system stuff yet.

  This was just gross.

    ```
    What do you mean by gross? (Violence stuff, squirrel stuff, something else?)
    ```

    - u/Nick_named_Nick:
      ```
      Gross as in left a bad taste in your mouth haha, nothing like any of that stuff you mentioned. It was a stupid chapter full of ham fisted references to earth, where nothing happened.
      ```

  - u/Rorschach_And_Prozac:
    ```
    Agreed
    ```

  - u/zombieking26:
    ```
    Agreed...not sure why this chapter even exists.
    ```
