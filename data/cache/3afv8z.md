  So...if I'm reading this correctly, [ ](#s "the "Counter Force" doesn't actually exist right? It's just that this particular instance is the world that had the 1/2^**some large number** chance of being lucky enough to have each previous hero destroy the Dust, and there are actually an infinite number of worlds that have already been destroyed by said Dust? And the people only believe in the Counter Force because they were, unknowingly, exceedingly, lucky?") Or am I missing some bigger point here?

    That's my interpretation of it, yes.

      I thought it was another version of the Black Pill's fight against [the enemy](#s "entropy") in SlateStarCodex's short story: http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/06/02/and-i-show-you-how-deep-the-rabbit-hole-goes/

      I guess that's what I get for not sounding out the phonetics of the last line correctly.

  I enjoyed this story, but felt that the hero was a little too quick in jumping to his conclusion, and while it's a good tag to add onto the end, it's not necessarily *right*. It's that moment of clear insight into a problem that's sometimes wrong?

    Indeed, this seems to be a case of Sherlock happening to know exactly *which* details are important and knowing precisely what they mean. For those who haven't read it, here is [Conan Doyle's very shortest story](http://www.sherlockian.net/acd/thetrick.html). It requires only the devotion of a minute or two.

      Can't remember the term or trope name for it, but most of Sherlock's Holmes' deductions are either perfectly easily caught by your average police investigation or so blatantly coincidental it's only through his protagonist powers that he's correct.

        The impossible leap of logic is more common in Batman stories than in Sherlock Holmes - at least Doyle was a good writer, while Batman has passed through the hands of more than a few hacks over the decades. So the trope name is [the Bat-Deduction](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatDeduction).

  I cannot be the only F/SN fan on here reading "Counter Force" over and over and going "Oh, shit, don't bring *her* into this!"

    I know eliezer is a f/sn fan, so probably not.

  My issue with this matches Psy-Kosh's - unless there's some reason that summoning a hero is something they can only do once per cycle, or the failure of the hero immediately destroys the world, there should be more worlds where they remember heroes failing and new heroes having to be summoned than ones where the hero always succeeds.
  ```

    Considering the hint about Einstein it might be that the Hero is Fienmen, or the comparable quantum physicist who put forth the man worlds hypothesis.
    ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    There are *more*, sure, but this is the particular *one* where every hero has succeeded. Because of the nature of many-worlds, that one particular world *does* exist, and this is a story about it.

    *My* particular issue is that the hero doesn't even do any experiments to make sure that, indeed, it's the anthropic principle rather than an *actual* counter-force. This guy was just summoned with magic - it's time to at least verify your assumptions about known quantities before making any decisions based off of them.
    ```

    - u/ArgentStonecutter:
      ```
      I understand that this is that particular world. I'm just pointing out that his conclusion that he's in that particular world _because of the anthropic principle_ doesn't make sense, because that would probably not be the only surviving world, and the majority of surviving worlds would probably not be ones in which every hero has succeeded.
