## [RST][C] - Three Days of Happiness

### Post:

"The premise revolves around a shop where one can sell away the remaining years of their life, and the consequences of doing so."

This is a highly-rated webnovel translated from Japan, which many adore.
Involves two smart characters both with so much depth to them. It's a short read and I highly recommend people from this sub to give it a chance.

This author has other works too which are just as great.

  This is a very touching story and worth reading in my opinion. I feel I'm learning new things about how good writing is done just by reading it.  Actually I am shocked that it is a translation, are you sure it is a translation? I don't see any links to originals in Japanese. Did the author themselves translate it? The culturally specific nuances of the source material strongly shine through in a way that translations rarely do. 

  I should note thst it's not particularly in the "rational" genre, this is a story about human emotions not about human cleverness (although i supposed sufficiently sensitive depictions of human emotions and failure modes can increase the rationality of the reader), the characters are deep and well written but they're not intelligent - the story is *about* the foolishness of the characters, and there are no attempts to munchkin the fairly exploitable premise, which is good because the story isn't about that. Nevertheless I'm glad it was posted since it gave me a chance to read it.
