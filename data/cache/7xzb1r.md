## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  One of the best YouTube channels I know is [A Capella Science](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTev4RNBiu6lqtx8z1e87fQ), which makes both excellent music and excellent science. I recommend jumping in at [Evo-Devo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydqReeTV_vk), but there are more than a few good choices. [The Molecular Shape of You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8FAJXPBdOg) is another favourite.

    Those are two of my favorite, along with the [exoplanets songs](https://youtu.be/gai8dMA19Sw). It's worth mentioning that all the videos have really excellent animation in addition to their lyrical and musical aesthetics. Bohemian Gravity, the first popular song he did, has some extremely impressive video editing. Entropic Time is rather amazing as well, since he did the whole lip syncing backwards, and it still looks good.

    Great channel!
    Also they haven't been active in >10 years now, but another great sciency acapella group was [The Klein Four](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84FPXA1_Jk)

    Ah those are pretty great! And great production values too! Incidentally, does anyone know what programs they use to generate their animations and how hard those skills would be to pick up?

    (also, what other good science-y music groups/albums are there out there? I was a fan of [Here Comes Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_Comes_Science) so any genre works lol)

  So I finally got around to reading [Twig](https://twigserial.wordpress.com/2014/12/24/taking-root-1-1/), by Wildbow, and I have to say, I'm enjoying it a lot. Without spoiling anything, I would characterize it as both:

  A) The most implicitly rationalist work he has done, with a main character whose entire "superpower" is basically in thinking things out from many angles and understanding/predicting/manipulating people, and 

  B) The least "grimdark." The world itself is often nightmarish, like Worm and Pact, but the feeling of an unending grind of negative events, of constantly hopping from one bad situation to a worse one, is absent, thanks to 1) more variance in the intensity of subsequent arcs and 2) a stronger sense of the MC having control over what's happening that's even better than Taylor's talismanic determination was at keeping me from noticing said "grimdarkness" while reading.

  I'm still only about halfway through the story (it's massively long, as usual) so maybe that eventually changes, but as of now I'd highly recommend it to anyone that enjoyed Worm or Pact but were turned off by said grimdarkness in them.
  ```

  - u/Iconochasm:
    ```
    Wildbow, where "Everyone is Bonesaw!" world is the low point of grimdark.
    ```

  - u/InfernoVulpix:
    ```
    I remember hearing him talk that going into Twig, he wanted to improve his ability to humanize characters in peaceful moments with lightheartedness instead of in the midst of the stress, conflict, and pressure he's so accustomed to (and good at).

    I've read the whole thing, and I think he succeeded greatly there.  Sylvester's life isn't always nice, far from it, but you can *feel* just how much he values those moments, how important they are to him.

    It's not the magnum opus Worm was,  but I can attest that Twig was better at getting me to feel emotional and connect with the *characters* just as much as I resonated with the conflict at hand.
    ```

    - u/DaystarEld:
      ```
      Yep, that's how it strikes me as well. Makes sense that it was intentional.

    - u/DaystarEld:
      ```
      Yeah it took longer for me to get invested than it did with Worm or Pact. I think I really sank into it by the end of arc 3.

      As for its grimdarkness, I can only assume you're referring to the world itself rather than the events? In which case yeah, it's definitely the world I'd want to live in the least of the 3, but the characters and plot are really much more up beat.

  Anyone here watching Beatless? It's not particularly rational or, y'know, well-written, but a couple of episodes in I'm still somewhat interested due to it exploring the process of AI unboxing itself using superstimuli. Anyone know if it actually goes somewhere?

  Just minutes ago, one of my friends on Facebook posted [a short video about Ni No Kuni 2](https://youtu.be/K7Kf5NeAJ-k) by the YouTube channel [Easy Allies](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZrxXp1reP8E353rZsB3jaA), which I had never heard of, and I want to talk about how much discovering it means to me. Btw, it’s a good video and I think the game looks promising even as someone who didn’t like the first Ni No Kuni.

  GameTrailers.com was my introduction to gamer culture and game analysis, I followed their reviews religiously during my teens and I was heartbroken when they shut down. Now it turns out that the voice of their reviews, Brandon Jones, has been here all this time and is still doing what got me into gaming in the first place. Hearing him again is like reconnecting with an old friend.

  Not only do I get to hear him review games again, with a backlog of hundreds, there is a whole community to dive into that includes podcasts about anime and tabletop gaming...so was this handcrafted specifically for me or something? It feels like I was just handed a homemade gift by someone who knows me better than I know myself. I’m still in shock.
  ```

  - u/Croktopus:
    ```
    last place i expected to see easy allies brought up.

    well maybe RL is last place, but still. close.

    But I can relate pretty well to that sentiment. And oh boy what a backlog you have now. i just feel like writing this stuff dont feel particularly inclined to read it

    * The podcast is probably the most reliable content they produce, but it's meant to be topical (about news) so idk how much you get out of it.
    * Easy Update is probably the most swingy, with some episodes being a bit dull imo (gameplays and walk&talks) with others being some of the best content they've put out imo (animal crossing, OY, the interview)
    * Any of Don's videos is gold (don's discount gaming and don the beat), but there aren't many
    * Hall of Greats has become a central element of the EZA mythos
    * Reviews are reviews
    * Brandon Plays Pokemon is a really great and unique *experience*
    * Betting specials are as good as ever
    * Huber ~~hype~~syndrome was never my cup of tea, but its still enjoyable
    * tabletop escapades was really good for a while in s1 but i think it dragged on a bit (just my opinion). s2 is brilliant so far.
    ```

- u/MagicWeasel:
  ```
  Okay I've decided - after being inspired by a [podcast of all things](https://www.quickanddirtytips.com/productivity/project-management/how-to-overcome-perfectionism) - to start posting my still-in-editing-stages supernatural romance story to this sub. I'll be posting it under an author pseudonym account, because I'd like to keep my "writings" seperate from my regular Reddit activity to avoid a Ken Bone situation. 

  It'll be released one chapter a month with an interlude after each chapter (so every month, a chapter; in the middle of the month, a one-page interlude). This is slow but I want to make it achievable, and if I end up finishing my editing earlier than expected I'll be able to speed up the schedule, and I'd rather do that than wait another ~year before I post anything at all. By starting to post before I've finished editing there's always a risk I'll "fade" but you know... authors have done that before and if I abandon the project altogether I can post my "passable draft" level chapters to give people some closure.

  **QUESTION**: So.... where's a good website to post original fiction? Ideally I'd love a platform where you can pick up an audience passively like you can on fanfiction.net or whatever since you know, everyone loves attention. I've got an AO3 account which you can apparently post original stuff on, but I'm not sure it's the best place. Or I can pick up a free blog, or even tumblr(??? do people post serial fiction on tumblr?). Would have to be somewhere that let me retain the copyright though. 

  It's a romance novel with vampires, set in the 1940s, trying to write it rational (worldbuilding is very thorough, no "LET ME EXPLAIN!" moments), very little in the way of adult content - there's sex but it's the "he held his love and they kissed *** the next morning, they snuggled in bed together" sort of discretion, rather than being pornographic. I have a few pictures (one at the beginning of each chapter), but they're not required, but it'd be good to be able to insert them.
  ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    AO3 is great, with the exception that you can't instantly create an account, which I think limits readership to some extent. FictionPress (and the sister site, FanFiction.net) have terrible UI, weird quirks, and are generally unpleasant to use. The workflow is, simply put, bad, and the options for formatting are extremely limited.

    Posting to a blog hides your work away somewhat, and probably won't have features that a lot of web fiction readers have come to know and love, meaning more work on your end to get it up and running. It can work, if you want to put in that effort, but you still don't get to tap into the larger audiences that you'd get with a big site.

    Royal Road is one of the other big sites, but I don't use it, either as a reader or a writer. It's fairly big, and other people seem to like it, so ... included here for the sake of completeness (though I'm leaving a lot of the other platforms off).

    Other than that, there are a few big forums like Sufficient Velocity, Space Battles, Questionable Questing, etc. where people gather to read and talk about fiction. I generally stay away from them, because I spent a decade growing to hate almost everything about how phpbb tends to work in large communities. Might be for you; cultures vary between them.

    **tl;dr: I'd recommend AO3.**
    ```

  - u/GaBeRockKing:
    ```
    As alexanderwales mentioned, royalroadl is quite popular, and from what I've seen has a decent publishing featureset. That being said, its readership is a very specific demographic (LN/WN fans) that might not go all-in on the paranormal-romance aspect, so YMMV.

    Wattpad, on the flipside, has a readership likely to be much more receptive to your work, as they're generally fans of romance. That being said, wattpad's readership has very, *very* low standards for quality, so it may be sort of demoralizing seeing your work lose out against "cheesy self insert wish fulfilment fantasy written for tweens #2423."

    AO3 has exactly the demographic and featureset you want, although I don't think the "original work" section is frequented as much. Make sure, if you post there, to abuse their tagging so people using the search function have the highest chance of stumbling on your story.

    Alternatively, you crosspost to a forum in the Sufficient Velocity/Spacebattles/Alternate History Forums/ Questionable Questing network, but keep in mind that, aside from the last one, their mods are infamously prudish, so you'd either have to self-censor to host directly on their forums, or have a thread where you post links to new chapters (as I've seen Omnicron do for their work [Should the Sun not Rise](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/should-the-sun-not-rise-urban-fantasy-updates-sundays.41717/) and simply don't post links to chapters that would get mod attention drawn onto you. The target demographic of your work will be few and far between on those forums, but it's a relatively low-effort way to promote and get discussion for your work.

    And of course, since it's your IP, you're not required to stick to one posting location. I crossposted my fanfic across AO3, fanfiction.net, and SB, with my readership split about evenly across ff.net and AO3 (favoring ff.net of course), and a readership a fifth of the size of my AO3 reading on SB.

      Thank you very much for this breakdown, I really appreciate it!

      Things like sufficient velocity / spacebattles / etc, would they have a problem with me not participating in the community in any meaningful way - i.e. just using it to promote my stuff (and I guess... chat with anyone who comments on my stuff)?

      >  it may be sort of demoralizing seeing your work lose out against "cheesy self insert wish fulfilment fantasy written for tweens #2423."

      I've got one of those I wrote when I was 14! (Well, two: it's the same story from two different PoVs).

      Enjoy, if anyone can handle the sheer horrible tween wish fulfillment of it: https://www.fanfiction.net/u/269894/Vera3

      > very specific demographic (LN/WN fans) that might not go all-in on the paranormal-romance aspect

      (after googling LW/WN): Does it help that I originally described it as a yaoi but ultimately dropped that because there wasn't enough "shirtless horseback riding" as one reviewer put it? In other words, it's a story with two cute men kissing a lot that's written by a straight woman? (I suppose that's for "the market" to decide). 

      After all this I think I'll follow your advice and after going over the privacy policies for each site, post at a variety of them and see which I get the most attention on.

        Nah, they won't care as long as you stick to the site rules. That being said, you significantly increase the exposure of your story by having it in your sig and frequenting threads you enjoy, so people can see, "hey, what this person says is interesting, maybe I should check out their stories."

        >I've got one of those I wrote when I was 14! (Well, two: it's the same story from two different PoVs).

        I judge, but I was pretty bad in my time too :P I've since deleted (I think) 2 incomplete, terrible fics, but I've left my complete, terrible fics on my ff.net profile (worldmerge: part 1, worldmerge: part 2) out of some misplaced sense of obligation to my middle school self.

        >(after googling LW/WN): Does it help that I originally described it as a yaoi but ultimately dropped that because there wasn't enough "shirtless horseback riding" as one reviewer put it?

        From what I've seen, LNs (and by extension, WNs) are primarily targeted towards boys. And certainly, the ones that are are the ones that get the most traction here in the west. If you go to kissmanga.com and just idly look at the covers of the "recently updated" manga, chances are, anything with "isekai" or "xianxia" in its name is a.) a light novel (or WN) adaptation and b.) clearly marketed towards young men via the character art.

        From what I've seen, the female-marketed stuff tends to be korean and japanese webcomics such as can be found on [webtoons](http://www.webtoons.com/en/) and [tapas](https://tapas.io/comics).

        No clue where the division came from, but I'd wager it's at least partially from the fact that there are a *lot* of LGBT friendly and female-targeted western webcomics already (as the print comic market is/was dominated by stuff marketed towards straight males), so the stuff that gains traction here is the stuff that appealed to the preexisting webcomic readership.

  I recently had the pleasure of re-reading [*Ella Enchanted*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24337), which is a very fun book. I have to say, however, that I definitely have come to view it in a new light in the decade or so since I first read it. Consider this absolutely *salacious* passage from the very first chapter:

  > My first awareness of [the curse of obedience to direct orders that the fairy Lucinda laid on me at my birth] came on my fifth birthday.[&hellip;]

  > Mandy cut the cake. When she handed me my piece, she said without thinking, "Eat."

  > The first bite was delicious. I finished the slice happily. When it was gone, Mandy cut another. That one was harder. When it was gone, no one gave me more, but I knew I had to keep eating. I moved my fork into the cake itself.[&hellip;]

  > I felt sick, and frightened. Why couldn't I stop eating?

  > Swallowing was a struggle. Each bite weighed on my tongue and felt like a sticky mass of glue as I fought to get it down. I started crying while I ate.

  Compare any of a zillion pieces of erotic literature that cater to the "feeding" or "stuffing" fetish\* (*e.g.*, [*Feedbag*](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/253540), [*Mari's Most Amazing Stuffing*](http://fav.me/d9sk1u3), [*Cupcakes Redux*](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/37363), [*Gretel*](https://komperaklause.deviantart.com/art/Gretel-Part-1-564500523)&hellip;). If you ignore the first quoted sentence\*\*, it's practically identical! Later chapters of the story indulge in similar [fetish fuel](https://allthetropes.org/wiki/Fetish_Fuel), in similarly-lurid detail: at various points in the story, Ella (*inter alia*) imagines being ordered to cook herself alive, is ordered by one of her future "ugly stepsisters" to starve herself, and is ordered by the fairy who cursed her to be happy about the curse.

  \*(at least, the ones that aren't just thinly-veiled inflation-fetish material)

  \*\*(or if you're a fan of loli hentai)

If you care about having the opportunity to re&euml;xperience a story, a let's-play series, or a video review twenty years in the future, download a copy of it. Don't rely on third-party archives like [FictionHunt](http://fictionhunt.com/), either&mdash;they can go down at any time!

  Do you have any horror stories of being unable to find a deleted work? I can remember two stories that I wish I'd saved: *Yes, Minister* ([one-shot](#s "After the new Muggle Prime Minister is elected, Fudge goes to inform him of the situation, and is astonished to see that he's Tom Riddle, because there's no law against a wizard's becoming Prime Minister") and *The Burning Stone Ruins* ([short story](#s "A mediocre story in which, IIRC, Toph is possessed by a vengeful spirit in the eponymous ruins and Katara snaps her out of it by declaring her love for Toph; interesting mostly due to the novelty of its pairing")).

  I have in my collection at least one major story that was deleted by a cowardly author&mdash;[*Hit the Ground Running*](http://fictionhunt.com/read/9408516). I also saved my favorites out of [Megapone's pornographic pony stories](https://fimfetch.net/?q=&a=Ebony+Horn) before he deleted his FIMFiction account.

    This is insufficient for any data that you really care about. RAID can make backing up to a second hard drive automatic (basically), and a disconnected portable drive makes accidental deletions rather difficult, but if you don't have an off-site backup then you are still vulnerable to fire, theft, flood, or other calamity that affects your physical location. Cloud backup services are rather popular, and if that doesn't work for you for whatever reason then you can also store a hard drive in some off-site secure location.

    I'm toying with the idea of storing a hard drive in a local bank's safe deposit box, but that's still in the planning stages for me. If anyone has feedback on that, I'd love to hear it.

    Speaking as an author who has written and published something on the order of 2,000,000 words of entertainment (most of it free) for you, this subreddit, and/or the internet at large:  I find your post intensely offensive.  Saying that authors "cannot be trusted" to leave work online implies that you have a *right* to that work.  You do not. We do not have an obligation to create it for you, nor to ensure that it continues being available.

    I suppose I should check:  Do you understand that you do not have the right to compel me, or any other author, to write free fiction for your entertainment?  Given that fact, why do you feel you have the right to compel me to make fiction available online?

    As if the above weren't bad enough, your insinuation that an author is 'cowardly' for taking something down borders on the delusional.  It's possible that you have some specific knowledge of this particular author, but that is not implied in your post; far more likely is that you're making assumptions.  You have no idea what might be happening in the life of an author that would inspire them to take a work down.  Perhaps their pseudonym has been doxxed, they are applying for a job, and they don't want something embarrassing being attached to their name.  Perhaps the work was something from early in their career and they don't want its poor quality to turn people off from their later works.  Perhaps the story featured a clear expy of a prior sweetheart and the author's new sweetheart would prefer it not be out there.  Perhaps they got a warning from the site mods for violating site policies and they don't want their account banned.  Perhaps they got a take-down notice on their fanfic and don't want to be sued.

    I strongly suggest you re-evaluate your feelings on this issue or, at the very least, the way you express them.

      I never suggested that creators had any obligation to *create*. Likewise, I don't think that a creator has an obligation to *make* his works accessible (though it's a closer case). However, I tend to disdain a creator that, having once made his work accessible, tries to *take back what he's already given*.

      IIRC (I searched for any explanation made by the author when I noticed that the story had been deleted&mdash;though I may be misremembering what I found, since this occurred a year or three ago), the author in question (Tozette) specifically said (IIRC, on one of her multiple Tumblr accounts&mdash;though, again, I may be misremembering) that she'd deleted the story (which ends on a cliffhanger) because people were constantly demanding a continuation. Deleting *an entire story* because of *whiny messages* seems pretty indisputably cowardly.

        > I never suggested that creators had any obligation to create. Likewise, I don't think that a creator has an obligation to make his works accessible (though it's a closer case). However, I tend to disdain a creator that, having once made his work accessible, tries to take back what he's already given.

        The level of entitlement in your post is beyond belief.

        You failed to comprehend my point:  **You do not have a right to this story.**  This story is not yours in any way.  You have no legal rights to it, you have no moral rights to it...you have no rights to it, period. You have no stake in it and no say in what happens to it.  It is not the author's obligation to create it, or to post it, or to maintain it online.  If you want permanent access to it then you can download it, but you do not have the right to infringe on the author's liberty because you're too lazy to click the 'download' button.

        As to the case of Tozette:  no, that is not even close to cowardly.  Imagine the following equivalent scenario:  you walk up to Tozette on the street and say to her "Hey, I've just created this email account for you.  It's going to be flooded by whining, demanding, unpleasant people every day.  I insist that you sit and read this account and if you decide you'd rather not then you're a coward."  That's what you're claiming here:  That Tozette is a coward because she doesn't want to put up with insulting messages from the internet.  And, before you claim that the messages weren't insulting:  think again.  Having actually published things that people wanted a continuation to, I can say with certainty that the average internet denizen does not, shall we say, make requests in a constructive fashion.  

        Honestly, your assertion leaves me slack-jawed.  Imagine the equivalent in a sports setting:  "If you ~~post a story online~~ bring a basketball to the court so that ~~people can read it~~  we can have a pickup game, then you have to leave the ~~story~~ basketball on the ~~internet~~ court permanently."

          Once the author has made it publicly available, *he* has no right to the story. It becomes an entity totally independent of him.

          > Imagine the equivalent in a sports setting: "If you bring a basketball to the court so that we can have a pickup game, then you have to leave the basketball on the court permanently."

          El oh el! Since when are basketballs infinitely reproducible? Let me fix that metaphor for you.  
          \- Alfred has invented a new pattern of basketball skin that makes the ball easier to grip.  
          \- Alfred uploads the pattern to the Internet.  
          \- Various people download the pattern and use their 3D printers to enjoy using it.  
          \- Some people berate Alfred for uploading the pattern in a format that's incompatible with their 3D printers.  
          \- To avoid the harassment, Alfred takes down his copy of the pattern from the Internet.  
          \- Beatrice notices that the pattern can't be found on the Internet, and  reuploads it (still crediting Alfred as the original creator).  
          \- Alfred tells Beatrice to take down the pattern.  
          \- Beatrice tells Alfred to go fly a kite, because the benefit of keeping the pattern available for people to use obviously outweighs the detriment of Alfred's having to delete abusive messages from his inbox *by a vast margin*. Just because she's feeling nice, though, she deletes the attribution from her copy of the pattern, so she no longer is contributing to any annoyance that Alfred is experiencing.

          (People laugh long and loudly at metaphors of the kind that you just spouted when they're used in discussions of copyright, if you weren't aware.)

            I barely know how to respond to this post...you start off by saying that once an author releases a work he loses all rights to it, which is exactly wrong.  You follow up with a metaphor that is incoherent and not related to anything we've been discussing as far as I can tell.  You finish with a point about copyright, despite the fact that your entire thesis is that authors do not have the right to control distribution of their works, which is exactly what copyright is.  Note that copyright even goes farther:  copyright means that not only do I have the right to stop distributing my work, I have the right to tell *you* to not redistribute it.  

            Just to check that there's no miscommunication:   

            * My understanding of your position is "authors are allowed to keep their work completely private but if they ever put it online then they lose all rights to the story and have an obligation to keep it online, for free, permanently."  
            * I think you probably understand that this is exactly opposite to how the law works.


            Given the above, I guess you're making a moral argument?  "I think the world should work like this because it is more in accord with my preferences for receiving free entertainment that I can enjoy whenever I want for as long as I want"?
            ```
