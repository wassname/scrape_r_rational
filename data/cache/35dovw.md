    Um....Thanks for taking the time to review, but I didn't actually write this story. It's just that I think it's a good story which deserved posting on this site. I'm confident that the author doesn't hang out in this subreddit and I have left a review on fanfiction.net letting him/her know about us.

    If you wanted the actual author to read your review, I suggest posting it on fanfiction.net instead of here.

      Ah, the Fallacy of Assumption. My mistake, review moved. 

      Since there were spoilers in it I've nuked the original.
