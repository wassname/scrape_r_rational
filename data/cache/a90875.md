  You know, I'm not sure if that was their intent, but now I need to try everything Bavitz has written just in case they're yudkowksy or AWales
  ```

    I can say with very high confidence that Bavitz is not Yudowsky or AWales. Bavitz includes a conspicuously large number of Canadians in their works without actually setting the story in Canada, something that someone who is not Canadian would never do. And Yudowsky definitely isn't Canadian and I'm pretty sure AWales is not Canadian. Seriously the number of Canadians in Bavitz' stories serve no purpose except for stroking Canada's weird inferiority-complex nationalism where we want to be acknowledged but the US overwhelms almost all of our culture.

      So nobody will believe I wrote something so long as it has enough Canadians in it?  Excellent.
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        You would however have to acknowledge Canada for something other than a talking point about how great/terrible government healthcare is, which as I understand it Americans are incapable of.

          Some of us do follow the old ice-fight, you know

          Its Canadians, all the way down

      So he is probably W!1db@w

        I don't think Wildblow has time to write so much in addition to his other works, but it's honestly much more likely. He shows a similar pattern of wanting to show off Canada, albeit much more subtly than Bavitz. In Worm, Dragon was from Newfoundland then later based in Vancouver, and Canada was specifically mentioned a couple times to be in a super-hero pact with the USA. Pact was actually set in Canada.

          For real though, Willybilly writes action scenes with better depictions of the relative 3D positions of characters than Bavitz. That said, tone is so so similar, and this could be misdirection. I, for one, am a fan of the Willbob-Madoka Cinematic Multiverse.

  Clownmuffle never fails to bring the hype

  Uh, must have missed this one. What's this story?

    This is the sequel to [Fargo](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11228999/1/Fargo), both are Puella Puella Madoka Magica fanfiction. If you haven't seen Madoka I heartily recommend it as well, it's a magical girl anime that has some excellent twists as you get further into the series, it's only 13 episodes plus a movie. Then the fanfictions are about cute teenage magical girls being gritty and depressed anti-heroes in America(with a large amount of Canadians characters for no particular reason as I mentioned elsewhere).

  Bavitz on Twitter said that everyone would hate this chapter but I loved it. Reminded me of my worst field trips.

  I really want to know what Cook's deal is, since she's apparently the only Actual Adult left in the empire besides the Empress.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    I don't know why he thought people would hate the chapter, that confuses me. I wouldn't say I loved this chapter but I thought it was of the standard 8/10 quality Bavitz usually puts out. 

    I agree I want to know what's up with Cook. But even more I want to know what's up with the Handmaiden(who I think must be an adult too). Cook I'm guessing became friends with the empress a couple decades ago, helped run the empire, has ambitions of her own and isn't super-tied to the empress but wouldn't betray her for no reason. Probably not too deep.

    But the Handmaiden is trusted with a mysterious position above DuPage or Cook and we have almost no information on her. She's a disciplinarian judging by her interaction with Clownmuffle, but I think that's the only info we have on her.
    ```

    - u/Hoactzins:
      ```
      I thought the implication (from last chapter) was that she's an artificial human created by Dr. Cho.
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        I must have missed that but that sounds likely.
        ```
