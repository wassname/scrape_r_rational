  Thanks for the update.  I had occasionally crtl+f'd through your user comments just to see if you had any mentions of it.

  >Seriously, this is all you're getting until December (unless I get drunk and accidentally upload the first four chapters without announcing it

  FF.net mailed me a notification this morning about a Chapter 2, but now the link goes to a "Chapter not found" error. So I can only assume you got lightly buzzed and decided to tease us.

  Or possibly you updated Ch1 again, and it briefly registered as 'new' for the purposes of notifications.

  Erm, is there something wrong with the first part of chapter 1?  It reads like a rough draft.  Also, this bit is unintentionally hilarious:  

  > Fury burning in his eyes, etcetera. "You foolish little boy. You can't be right. Etcetera."

      This is a pretty awesome way to write that I'd never seen before. Did you learn to draft like this somewhere, or did you come up with it yourself?
