## Discussion thread for Animorphs the Reckoning chapters don't line up with what I'm reading?

### Post:

I've been reading the story on fanfiction and the chapter ordering/numbering seems all fucky. I can never find the correct thread for the chapter I just read. Is there a compiled list of the threads somewhere?

### Comments:

- u/tjhance:
  ```
  note that, due to interludes, chapter numbers don't quite line up.

  For example, this chapter: https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11090259/61/r-Animorphs-The-Reckoning
  fanfiction.net labels it as chapter 61, but the title of the chapter is 'chapter 42'.

  I suspect you had trouble because you were looking at the wrong number.

    Ah you're correct. Thank you
