  Yes yes yes i've been waiting for this to update YES

  ETA: No really, two days ago I checked because I remembered the 22nd, and the author had changed it to the 24th, and I've been checking basically hourly and then oh I go run some errands and come back and hey look

  This is amazing

  ETA2: i ship it

    I actually hate having to wait for chapters on things. I was extremely glad that Worm finished up while I was reading it so that I didn't have to wait, especially since I've never read something so... intense.

    I almost want to wait until things like Mother of Learning are completed to read it, but you never know when authors are going to stop working on a project.

      I hate waiting for chapters too, and far prefer attacking a completed work. It's even worse when you've been chewing through hundreds of thousands of words and reach the end, since then you have to wait for weekly or even monthly updates (and that's not even counting the ones that never get a proper ending because the author loses interest).

      I've been trying to decide whether it's worth reading Mother of Learning given that it's unfinished, but I suppose it depends on how much longer it's going to be before it's officially complete.

        Quite a while, unfortunately I can't seem to figure out how find out when each chapter was uploaded, or maybe it's a crappy website and lacks the feature. But I digress, I believe I recall the previous updated status was over a month ago. Also, he has a FAQ on his user page

        >Q: Curious, how far would you say the story is?

        >Not even close to the end. The story basically has 3 arcs, and we're only getting close to the end of the first one. I'm really going to have to speed up the pace if I want to finish the story in anything resembling a reasonable time-frame.
