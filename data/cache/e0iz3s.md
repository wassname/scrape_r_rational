## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  Your mind as it currently is (memories, values, etc) gets instanced into 1000 random individuals in a city. There is no mental link, telepathy, hive mind control or method of replicating this instancing. Your brain state is copied and pasted. It’s just yourself in 1001 bodies. Lower brain functions and things like hand-eye coordination are remapped to your brain state so that the new bodies don’t immediately start seizing or asphyxiating.

  How do you coordinate yourselves to maximise your values?

    You haven't said *which* city, but I'll assume that it's the city I currently live in, which complicates things, because it's not that big of a city, and a thousand random people means a little less than one and a half percent of the city population.

    We immediately attempt coordination, but if we don't know what the heck is going on, that might be difficult. The logical thing to do for any of the copies is to stop whatever they're in the middle of to get in contact with the prime instance, which means the prime instance will naturally be in charge of coordinating all the copies. Knowing the scope of what's happened from reading the prompt, I'm really not sure that we can keep it contained, which really limits what's possible. It partly depends on when it happens: if it's one in the morning, the prime instance will probably be awake, and the copies will then *also* be awake and able to investigate/coordinate without much interference or immediate risk of detection. If it's during the day, there will probably be a lot of accidents from my mind suddenly being in a body that's driving, along with other scenarios that are easy to envisage but which I can't be assed to run the probabilities on.

    Emptying bank accounts is dubiously ethical but also the first thing that I would probably do. There's an argument that the people previous inhabiting the bodies are completely dead and thus their wills (or equivalent) should be executed, but there's also an argument to be made that they've been replaced by a new person who's entitled to their stuff, and if there are suddenly a thousand people with nothing to their name, that's a huge problem. Unsurprisingly, there's not much in the legal code about overwriting minds.

    Once most of the copies have checked in with the prime instance, some of us can start working on an FAQ, some can start working on public relations, and some can make plans for housing, food, and basic necessities. Others will work on getting everyone settled in the short-term, meaning getting everyone's phone numbers, names, and descriptions in a spreadsheet, getting new, unique accounts spun up for each of them, requisitioning computers, and so on.

    My skills are, unfortunately, fairly narrow. I'm an okay writer and a middling, out of practice software engineer, with the latter obviously being far more practical and scaling a lot better. Still, my city, in the wake of an event that kills a thousand people, would be suffering a real glut of labor-doable-by-me, mixed with a loss of labor in vital sectors that I personally can't replace. That's assuming that in the long term, we would be able to stay free. Moving seems like it would be in order, preferably to the middle of nowhere using combined funds, where we can live in a commune together at minimal cost, working remotely on various problems. I'm pretty sure that I would get along well with myself. We would divvy up necessary occupations, with a few of us specializing in different areas that would be necessary for the group, in a form of vertical integration. We would buy the things we like in bulk, which would be nice.

    I think it would be *great* to have sleeper cells (or agents), but unless I'm given fifteen minutes or so to make plans before the event, I don't think it's doable, and once the government inevitably gets wind of it, we would get rooted out pretty quickly, since I have virtually no knowledge of spycraft and the copies would all hail from my relatively small city, which presumably would have a lot of eyeballs turned toward it.

    **tl;dr: Compound in the middle of nowhere with good internet, working remote and/or setting up small companies if those companies can function with myself filling every role.**

      I notice your concern for elimination of labour. If the scenario was changed to be all children in the city, how would your plan change? Presumably, you could take on the role of a student and have time to plan and execute plans. 

      Agreed, scenario is obviously ethically terrible. It’s almost a reverse munchkin situation, picking up the pieces after a ROB incident

      You could play a card from MOL- I am uniquely good at teaching myself things- if 1000 of me branch into different specialties and write summaries geared for my own education, I could probably bump my effective learning rate by a factor of a couple.  Since I spend lots of my professional time learning things this would be a huge boon

      The good news is, now that you've written this comment, if this ever happens all your other selves will know to chill out for as long as possible and pretend to be sick until they can get in touch with Prime You. Same for everyone reading this!

    No warning. No time to plan.

    Just, suddenly, I'm in a new body.

    Panic, but quietly. Look around. Nobody else panicing?

    Deep breath. Stay calm. Stay *calm*. Check pocket. Cellphone? Good.

    ...no idea what the unlock code on this phone is. *Not* good.

    Try thinking 'unlock phone'. Let muscle memory, habit, whatever you want to call it, guide my actions. If that *works*, it means a number of things. Lots of them will be important later. But for now... web browser. Gmail account. I remember my own password. I - wait. There's an email to me? From me? "READ FIRST?"

    ...

    ...huh. So there's not just *one* of me in a new body. There's a lot. None of us have memories from each other, so... copies?

    Basic plan, then.

    Assume (hope?) that the copy process is temporary. That the host body's original mind is there, buried underneath, and merely suppressed for a time. (Try to purposefully relax my hold on this brain. Let the original mind get back. I certainly never planned this).

    Seek out any potential problems or issues that my fresh perspective on this person's life can solve. Try to leave this body, this life, in a better state than I found it. Try to deal with this person's life... employment will be tricky, but using my host's muscle memory, I can probably manage to fake it for a few days at least.

    Hope like anything that this won't *last* a few days. But I'll try not to get my host fired before they're able to regain control.

    But if I find anything that my original self (or any other selves) need to know, then I can coordinate that with my gmail account.

    (I may need to convince Google that yes, I really am logging in from a thousand different locations at the same time. If that fails, I'll create a personal subreddit and only grant access to accounts that send my primary account a private message containing my time travel password).

    I sure hope this never ever happens, because there's no way those 1000 people that have been overwritten all have no social connections that will notice things are very very wrong. Considering these individuals are randomly selected, and my copies don't keep the memories of the people they overwrote, they won't be able to fake anything well. If the targets had jobs, odds are that my copies would have no idea how to do those jobs. If the targets had families or friends, my copies wouldn't share any of the memories they had with the original targets.

    At best, my 1000 copies will all fake having amnesia to explain why they don't remember anything that they are supposed to know. But that in itself is a massive red flag: one person having amnesia is already somewhat odd. 1000 people having it at once? Highly suspicious. People will investigate, looking for any connection between the 1000 amnesiacs. And then things will get worse.

    It wouldn't be long before someone notices that all 1000 amnesiacs have strangely identical personalities. That they respond almost identically to various stimuli (because they are all copies of my mind). Theories about deliberate possession will arise, and then my 1000 clones will have to deal with very bereaved families and loved ones harassing them, demanding the return of the original targets. And if any of my copies cracks under interrogation and reveals my name? I will be very very screwed.

    EDIT: Honestly the best thing  I could hope for is those 1000 copies kill themselves to save me, the original. But knowing myself, that's not gonna happen.

      Oof. Well reasoned. The scenario you wrote is very “short horror story”. If you retained all the original memories as some sort of quasi-yeerk would that change things for you? At any point you can call up the right memories, skills actions. Some sort of autopilot mode.
      ```

      - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
        ```
        In this scenario, I would be the least useful clone. The copies are literally me but better, barring any physical disabilities or difficult circumstances. We might set up a website so we could communicate with one another and help out one another, but I would largely be not involved because I would have nothing to offer my copies. At best, since my copies are me, they know how to do my job, so they might help me out of sheer boredom/nostalgia even though I can't do anything to repay them that another copy couldn't do better.

        It's kinda mundane really, but the more exciting ways of cooperation tend to be illegal (like insider trading using copies) or insane (like experimenting on ourselves in the same way as that recent short story about Emily and Control did).
        ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Depends a lot on whether or not we know what’s going on. If not, there’s very little coordination for a while. 

    It seems like normalcy probably can’t be preserved for more than a small fraction for a short period, so I’d be tempted to try and leverage the abnormality immediately. I think I would try to make what amends I could to friends and family without endangering myself. Out of whatever population has smartphones and can coordinate via discord or slack, 20% of us (probably not including the original?) might storm some public place and do something weird, like sing songs badly. No real goal other than fun and maybe testing coordination after there’s been time for divergence. 70% probably organize for some social issue. Most of that 70% will probably get a shared bank account and attempt to join some communes. 

    This is definitely hard to munchkin, largely because 1000 people have basically been killed at random, and only a small fraction would be able to successfully pretend to be their host, and a smaller fraction would be able to do it for the long term. Not to mention the guilt associated.

    If it was something like 1000 depressed antisocial young adults with few or no friends who got replaced, that would be a lot more useable. Or if you got some significant portion of their memories.

    How would I (one of the 1000 clones) know that this is what happened? Wouldn't the more natural assumption be that the original me got shifted into a different body rather than duplicated and shifted?

    I guess the best answer would be that I'd check my various online accounts for posts that I don't remember making. If I see one, I'd register an email account and send myself an email containing personal information in an attempt to verify that the person making those posts is really me. At which point original me would probably figure out WTF is going on and start trying to coordinate these thousands of clones. Given the little time I've thought about it, our plan would probably be to try to maintain as much of our new bodies prior life as possible, given that I would very much like to be someone else and this is apparently my chance for that.

  Inspired by the other clone post

  One day you're out in the woods or some place where it is plausible no one will walk across you for 12 hours.

  You duplicate 9 times, resulting in 1023 copies and 1 original.

  You have 12 hours before someone interrupts you to make a plan. What is it?
  ```

  - u/justletmebrowse68:
    ```
    Wouldn’t that be 511 clones and 1 original?

    Presumably food wouldn’t be an issue in those first few hours as I could very likely survive 12 hours on my own with minimal discomfort. So that’s one less thing to worry about. 

    If my phone and other effects duplicate with us, we would have to remove the sims fairly quickly to avoid a tower getting pinged and some alarm being set off. Well the premise that we wouldn’t be discovered for 12 hours, which suggests that we are either in a heavily secluded area or it at least would take some time for it to be acted on even if discovered quickly. It would also mean that some small amount of cash money is duplicated, which could help in the short term. 

    Leveraging the added brainpower would result in better planning. I would group off. Have groups of twenty or so discuss various methods of survival, then have groups discuss and break down their best ideas with neighbouring groups until the most effective ideas surface, planning for the known unknowns with various contingencies. It would be also be useful to start a thread on r/rational I’m sure.

    I feel like some should go to ground, changing appearances as well as possible (haircuts, clothing) and heading out in small of no more than three￼. Heading off in different directions, including further into the wilderness. The goal would be to not be discovered unless given the right signal that we’re not being disected and tortured. Which would be￼￼￼ an agreed upon phrase or phrases added to agreed upon wiki article(s) to be checked semi-regularly among other sites. 

    That’s a lot of mouths to feed. I don’t know how to make money online easily with my skillset. Uh. Monetise a viral video or 1000 identical dudes in a forest. Go extremely public extremely quickly and march in a city. They hopefully won’t just blackbag us all if we appear on live tv.

      First time 2, second 4,third 8,fourth 16,fifth 32, 6 64, 7 128, 8 256, 9 512. You're right my bad, thought for some reason you had to take off the first count (1).

      Everything you can carry is duplicated so you're right on the sim card. At least 12 hours so it could be longer. I was thinking about making it so you know that the next time you go somewhere where 1024 of you won't be discovered for at least 12 hours this will happen but then I think everyone would buy gold to duplicate. 

      I think going public is an interesting attempt to avoid capture. If you permanently livestream your squad it will be hard for someone to kidnap you. Not sure how likely that is anyway, especially since there are so many, though obviously no one will believe your story.

      I wonder how much groups of 20 would retread the same ground. I wonder how much dialogue benefits clones. 

      Assuming that you successfully go live and don't get kidnapped what are your plans? What do you do with 1023 brothers who believe that your bed is theirs as are your friends, family and password. 

      In this scenario it's not clear who the original is either since at the moment of duplication you're briefly unconscious.
