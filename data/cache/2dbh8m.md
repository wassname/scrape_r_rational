  That comment section is ... well, what happens when two sides of an argument both think that they are clearly right about something, complicated by the fact that a lot of people are talking at cross-purposes, or about different things.

    Nobody mentioned whether they enjoyed the fight :(

      Well I liked the fight. I think that I like all of the fights you write, actually. There's a part of Fine Structure that I often find myself pointing to and saying, "There, that is exactly how a superhero fight scene should be written."

        Which part, out of curiosity?

          Probably [this one](http://qntm.org/capekiller).

            Yup, that's the one!

      The fight confused me at first because I had thought that The Glass Man was sort of like a "Incarnated Ra" built out of thin air like that mech created by Abstract Weapon all those chapters ago. You did a good job of establishing its dominance when it first nicked the Bridge from Laura. 

      But then in this fight it turns out to be a *human*, which is a step *down* in power that kinda threw me off at first. Hope that makes sense.

  Looking at the comment thread and the author's responses, it's interesting how much The Glass Man comes off as a [Strawman with a Point](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawmanHasAPoint).

  One thing that confuses me is that even though the listening post is destroyed, the characters are still casting magic.
  ```

  - u/AmeteurOpinions:
    ```
    The listening post doesn't control magic, it just lets the Wheel Group have their admin privileges. Magic is run from that other complex where Laura found the Bridge.
    ```
