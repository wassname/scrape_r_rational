## [D]/[Q]What are the 'must reads' of rational/munchkin/HSF/HF/deconstructionist fiction?

### Post:

I've been curious for a while now on this, so I'm going to see what the community here has to say about it. What are the fics that 'everyone' has read, or has to read? What is the best of the genre? Contribute a list of 5-10 and see how they compare.

  I think I'd really only consider [*Luminosity*](http://luminous.elcenia.com/) and [*Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality*](http://www.hpmor.com) to be in "the canon". Most people have read [*Worm*](http://parahumans.wordpress.com/2011/06/11/1-1/), but it's sort of adjacent to the subgenre instead of really in it.

  Other than that ... maybe [The World of Null-A](http://us.macmillan.com/book.aspx?isbn=9781429983624)? Maybe some of the stuff [I've written](https://www.fanfiction.net/~alexanderwales)? I tried to do "sort - top all time" for this subreddit, but that didn't offer much in the way of illumination.

  Edit: I only read half the title.

  **Munchkin**

  * [Harry Potter and the Natural 20](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20)
  * [The Two Year Emperor](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9669819/1/The-Two-Year-Emperor)

  Categorizing works is hard, especially when the works aren't written with that categorization in mind. Hard science fiction and hard fantasy are terrible about this, especially when so many people seem to put *A Song of Ice and Fire* into the "hard fantasy" category when the rules for its magic are *completely unknown to the reader*. With that said:

  **HF/HSF**

  * *The Mars Trilogy* by Kim Stanley Robinson
  * *Blindsight* by Peter Watts
  * Most things by Greg Egan
  * *Mistborn* by Brandon Sanderson (and many of his other books)

  **Deconstructionist**

  * *Watchmen*
  * *Goblins* the ~~(no longer updated)~~ webcomic
  * *What's So Funny About Truth, Justice, And The American Way?*

  I may go back and edit this after giving it some more thought.

    Trying to work out why I agree with you - I think there's a distinction between "rational fiction" and "rationalist fiction".  The former is defined by the four mandatory points in the sidebar; the latter *adds* explicitly rationalist themes to a rational structure through real techniques and approaches (ie the bonus points in the sidebar).

    Basically, the first points together form an uncommon but known style; while difficult to pull off well most writers could at least make an attempt if they wanted to.  The latter, like very hard SF set on a spacecraft, won't work *at all* without an unusual amount of expertise backing it up - and since readers can try the techniques at home, assuming your readers aren't experts either won't help.  

    So the (acknowledged) "rationalist canon" is basically limited to *HPMoR*, *Luminosity*, and *The World of Null-A*.  

    One written under a nom de keyboard advertising a rationality community (by it's founder), one by a member of that community, and the lesser-known novel by a brilliant author of SF.  Oh, and chapter one opens:

    >Common sense, do what it will, cannot avoid being surprised occasionally. The object of science is to spare it this emotion and create mental habits which shall be in such close accord with the habits of the world as to secure that nothing shall be unexpected.

    The challenge of finding more candidates was set out [five years ago](http://lesswrong.com/lw/3m/rationalist_fiction/), and I don't know of anything convincing that's been found.

    so far, the two year emperor is reminding me of the wizardry series by rick cook. "programmer munchkins the shit out of fantasy world"

      I can definitely see the resemblance. I loved the first book in that series, but remember feeling more and more let down as I went on until eventually I stopped. I think part of the essential problem of munchkinism is that eventually you break the world wide open and change everything, which most authors don't seem willing to do. But I must have read those books back in the 90s, so maybe I'm getting some of the details wrong.

        [Effulgence](http://belltower.dreamwidth.org/8579.html) is basically (a long, indulgent examination of) what you get. If the best bits of it were edited down into a single, short arc (and the confusion of Bellas collapsed down a bit), it'd be a wonderful thing to throw in the face of any SF author who thinks conflict requires mortality, scarcity, etc.

    Goblins will probably resume updating sometime in the near future.

    I haven't looked at *Luminosity* since I don't know anything about *Twilight* (aside from the usual angsty teenage sparkly vampire meme you pick up by just being alive in the Western world). Is that a necessary pre-requisite?
    ```

    - u/alexanderwales:
      ```
      No, you don't really need to know anything about the series. The series features a newcomer being introduced to the world, so you get all that stuff as it comes up in the fanfic.
      ```

      I have never read Twilight, nor watched the movies; I enjoyed Luminosity immensely.

        Same here. It was quite deliberate on my part.

      > the usual angsty teenage sparkly vampire meme

      It *originated* that meme.
      ```

      - u/BakeshopNewb:
        ```
        I was referring to its nucleic meme, as in "It's pretty hard to not know at least that much about it just by being around."

  Of [Eliezer's fiction](http://yudkowsky.net/other/fiction/), Sword of Good and Three Worlds Collide are also particularly good, IMHO.

  Eliezer's recommendations are near the bottom of this author's note. http://hpmor.com/notes/87/

  I quite enjoyed Time Braid, although I'm not really familiar with the narato universe.

    I'm not at all familiar with the Naruto universe and I very much enjoyed Time Braid.

  Do we REALLY not have a sidebar entry for this question?

  Because we should definitely have a sidebar/FAQ entry for this.
