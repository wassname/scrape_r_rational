  Well, that wrapped up a bit faster than I thought it would. Now we're suddenly out of crisis mode and back to "what should I do in this world" mode.

  I think the only major unresolved thing is the empire army. I don't think we're at risk of the barrier going down and them invading, so they must be off doing something else now.

  Well that and the relationship stuff with Ameliah. I guess that's an unresolved thing too.
  ```

- u/KDBA:
  ```
  I was surprised that Rain handed over the reins so easily. But on consideration, it does make a lot of sense. The barrier has brought him nothing but pain, and being the only one with access is painting a target on himself.
  ```

  - u/JackStargazer:
    ```
    He had Root access, he probably just made the other guy an admin as well, so he can also maintain the barrier. I can't imagine Rain would have removed his own access.
    ```

    - u/KDBA:
      ```
      Most likely, but he still needs physical access and that can easily be denied if the Watch don't want him to have it.
      ```

  - u/NotValkyrie:
    ```
    let's just hope he gets a blue to push him over level 25 out of it
    ```

    - u/TheTruthVeritas:
      ```
      He definitely should get something out of it. The too Watch dog, the Warden herself, said that Fel Sadanis is a really important city, and if it falls into Empire hands, the war is lost.

      There’s no way they wouldn’t offer a level 25 blue for control of the city and the actual barrier device, which only Rain could find, should Rain offer those terms. Plus, Rain is pretty much the most dependable, capable, and trustworthy Guildie there, so there shouldn’t be any possible negative consequences of handing him a blue. The rank shift in Fel Sadanis should more than make up for that blue too, as there should be more and higher leveled blues there afterward.

      Delve is quite the rational story and Rain is always a min-maxing person, he’d be a fool to miss out on such an overwhelmingly helpful benefit. Even Velika got a high level blue once she got the city, with the Warden physically there, hell, there should be no issue with Rain actually getting a level 50+ blue with all the help he provided.

      If he doesn’t get a blue, there better be some really good reason, because he’s been stuck at the level cap with virtually no major improvements for half the entire novel, and without a free blue it looks like it’s going to take a lot longer before he finally passes level 25 and becomes op.
      ```

      - u/NotValkyrie:
        ```
        Yeah but the watch treats the guild with a general distrust as a rule. Not sure how much they want to make Rain stronger as he's already rank 3 as a danger rate. If he anyone deserves it it's him, but there's always a concern that the watch will shortchange him in the name if greater good and ou boy really doesn't have any leverage anymore.
        ```

        - u/sparr:
          ```
          > he's already rank 3 as a danger rate

          That stuck out in a recent chapter... His rating is outdated. We haven't heard the requirements for rank 4 (?), but I wouldn't be surprised if he has crossed that threshold.
          ```

- u/Rorschach_And_Prozac:
  ```
  God I hope - something - happens besides character dialogue/ monologue soon. 

  The system is such a neat idea and well written concept that I want to see explored more, but the main character has been level capped and made no progress for so long. Like half the book at this point. 

  And the character writing is absolute bottom tier cringe. Every character has the exact same voice. Every character is the same snarky, edgy teenager, with dialogue barely indistinguishable from any other character.
  ```

  - u/thatavidreadertrue:
    ```
    100%, I couldn’t resist and binge read like 8 chapters after I had resolved to wait until next year, but surprise surprise - still absolutely ZERO progress in his builds or his strength.
    ```

    - u/sildet:
      ```
      I unsubbed from the patreon because of this. I'm done with it until it catches up. Even when it does, I'm not sure I'll start reading again. The pace is glacial.
      ```

    - u/Dudeoram:
      ```
      I'm not someone who particularly cares about builds in litRPGs because for me these are supposed to be stories. And if the story the author is trying to tell requires the MC to be at level 5 for 40 chapters that's fine as long as the plot around that is interesting. One of the problems I see in Delve when it comes to Rain's personal growth is that we have been constantly introduced to characters that were *way* beyond Rain and are putting him in uncomfortable situations because of it. Rain's response to said situations has usually been "I'm gonna get stronger so that this doesn't happen again" but he hasn't really. Whether that's due to the way that the plot is structured or Rain's personal procrastination is irrelevant it still sucks to constantly read about how everyone even remotely important treats him and his friends as stones on the side of the road.
      ```

      ```
      I would argue that being able to script spells isn't "nothing"


      Also a story can be more than just the main character becoming stronk.
      ```

      - u/Roxolan:
        ```
        *Can* be. I'd certainly keep reading WtC if it became non-stop talk therapy; those are some of my favourite chapters. 

        Isn't, in this case (for me anyway), because [I don't much care about any of the characters](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EightDeadlyWords). Like Rorschach said, the writing just isn't good enough. 

        If Rain died tomorrow and we started following the amazing adventures of, like, Kettel, I'd be pretty much fine with it as long as interesting System-related things kept happening; meanwhile Rain heart-to-heart talk scenes do nothing for me.
        ```

- u/PDNeznor:
  ```
  Its over, its finally over. We can story in the world again! We're free bitches, free! Lets go find monsters and kill dungeons, like old times.
  ```

- u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
  ```
  So... Rain let Lavarro in.

  Why? Why not just let her daughter out?

  He literally just got rid of one crazy unstoppable killing machine (Velika), and now he invited another one in.
  ```

  - u/KDBA:
    ```
    Was it Rain that did it, or that Watch officer that now has the controls?
    ```

  - u/WalterTFD:
    ```
    It feels like if Rain refuses to let Lavarro in she goes looking for ways to convince him to do that.  He doesn't want that on his head, so he lets her in.
    ```

    - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
      ```
      But why would she? All Lavarro wants is her daughter.

      (Rain doesn't know she has been mind controlled by someone who actually needs to go inside.)
      ```

      - u/ansible:
        ```
        Yes.  Lavarro is a **loose canon**, and exceedingly dangerous.  The Watch officer imprint controlling Lavarro needs to still act the part to maintain infosec that the original Watch officer even has this ability to takeover people.
        ```

        - u/N0_B1g_De4l:
          ```
          Yeah, "let me see my daughter or I'll fuck shit up out here" is a thing that's plausible for Lavarro to say, and it accomplishes the Warden's goals. Rain doesn't have any particular reason to suspect Lavarro is being mind-controlled, so he's not likely to be asking if the unstable irrational person being unstable and irrational is actually secretly trying to fulfill some other goal.
          ```

      - u/ZeCatox:
        ```
        He also doesn't know she killed the other citizen in a fit of rage and is therefore responsible for a part of their situation.

        For all he knows, she may be a psychopath, she "just" wants to see her daughter.
        ```

        - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
          ```
          Eh, I was referring more to her actions in chapter 62, where she almost suffocated him to death, let him fall onto the ground head first, threw Jamus into a wall, threw Carten *through* the wall and out into the streets where he could have crushed some innocent bystander, and basically forced Hargrave to ban her from the guild before she could escalate further.

          And Hargrave isn't here to protect them anymore.
          ```

          - u/ZeCatox:
            ```
            I know, that's what I was referring to as her being a psychopath.

            But Rain also tends to be clinically selfless and isn't necessarily as rational as us readers regarding this sort of matter : for him, Lavarro's concern probably has to be focused on her daughter at the moment (and I don't think he would be wrong about it, even if it actually was Lavarro in that body \^\^)
            ```

- u/Dudeoram:
  ```
  This is the the chapter where I think the story drops in quality.

  Spoilers for future Patreon chapters and the current chapters of The Daily Grind.

  >!From Rain's plan to start a guild, to how the end of this arc is handled, to how Lavarro and the Platinum Plate are handled to how Velika and the Citizens are handled. It just feels like a bunch of storylines were cut short and skipped while Rain's overarching plan was put on the fast track despite how ill-prepared he is and the story suffers because of it. His plan isn't even necessarily a bad one but he knows so little of the world that attempting to create a group with the intentions to upset the general current order is incredibly rash. And you would think one of his friends would tell him that especially when you consider all the things that they've gone through that are directly related to the state of the world. And it feels even worse when you consider that there is currently another story going through what is roughly the same arc, at least when it comes to the starting a group with the intentions of changing the world, The Daily Grind.!<

  >!In TDG James has started a guild(or an Order as he calls it) , but the reasons for it are equal part desire and necessity. A huge group of people were just rescued after being abducted from Officium Mundi and the results of said abduction and rescue means that there are now literal dozens of people whose life were screwed with by what can be considered a minor eldritch horror and were erased from the minds of everyone they knew and now have to be reintroduced to society while at the same time these people were exposed to true magic in a world where it was thought to not exist. Many don't want to just give up on that. This means that the people who want to go back to their lives need financial and emotional support while the people who wants to keep diving into the extraordinary need physical and emotional support. Support that as far as he is concerned only he and his group of friends can provide. There's more but whatever, you get it. The reason he hasn't explored more of these places is because despite spending nearly a year searching he hasn't found one yet even with their abilities so the world literally couldn't be explored.!<

  Not to mention the other issues I have with SeneschalSoul's style. None of this is some kind of PSA demanding that people stop reading Delve and read TDG, I just think it's unfortunate.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Thanks for telling us. >!But is there still advancement on the system side of things? I feel like interesting development in that department at the cost of horrible worldbuilding and dialogue has sort of been the trade-off from the beginning.!<
    ```

    - u/Dudeoram:
      ```
      >!They figure out that there are multiple uses to the various orbs and start applying them in other ways, sometimes. The office starts being more active. They do eventually find other dungeons and see that they have their own rules and intentions.!<

      But if you didn't like the dialogue you shouldn't read it. I don't find it terrible but there *is* a lot of talking so...
      ```

    - u/kurtofconspiracy:
      ```
      Huh. I get the complaints about characters, (even though I find them adequate), but I think the worldbuilding is quite interesting. I like how the system shapes the society and vice versa.

      Also, the scripting is satisfying my thirst for progress for now. Rain is gaining powers outside the scope of even the highest level natives. And sychronization is progress as well. Complicated multidimensional progress is a feature. (Kittens game beats swarm simulator.) All that being said, while I am no longer salty about the recent lack of levels, it would be nice to have some soon.
      ```

  - u/KDBA:
    ```
    Not reading the spoilers, but TDG bored me to death very early on while Delve has kept my interest this far.
    ```

    - u/Dudeoram:
      ```
      That's fair I guess. Comparatively TDG starts slower than Delve in terms of general plot but I think it's character development is way stronger despite having to spread that development among 3 main characters and 3-4 side characters. I cared more about James' boss than I did most of the side characters that were encountered around the same length of time in Delve, and more than the old mage dude in Rain's party. It also means we got to see more of Officium Mundi and it's effects on the world through James and co then we do in Rain with the dungeons and blues.
      ```
