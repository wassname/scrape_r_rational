## [D] Monday General Rationality Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics!  Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world?  Have you:

* Seen something interesting on /r/science?
* Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
* Figured out how to become immortal?
* Constructed artificial general intelligence?
* Read a neat nonfiction book?
* Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?

  Let's optimize dating! But in a socially aware way!

  One of the problems I've had while dating is that I have a really hard time finding conversation subjects. This is kind of a catch-22: once you have a close relationship with someone, you get a sense of what subjects they're interested in, you have a few recurring themes that you can come back to and you know your common interests well enough that you can start a conversation from scratch easily enough; but you need to have interesting conversations in the first place to build that level of familiarity.

  Ideally, the kind of conversations I'd want to have with new dates are about what they care about (I can talk about *my* interests all day with very little prompting). The very specific type of conversation I'm aiming for is one where the girl I'm talking to tells me about what she thinks everyone else gets wrong. Like, the rationalist itch? I think everyone has it at one point or another, that moment where they go "Man, X should really be that way, but most people who do X do it that over way instead, that sucks!". I've had these conversations a few times, and I really loved them, and I always felt like I was connecting with the person I was talking to, like I was glimpsing at a piece of their source code, you know?

  The problem is getting to this conversation gold. I don't really know how to do that except by chance. I mean, I guess I could just tell my date everything I just said, but:

  - It requires some social trust that's not always there (although I think that's more of an excuse to weasel out than a real cost-benefit statement),
  - It can grind the conversation to a halt; the girl I'm talking to doesn't *necessarily* have a pamphlet on her life and personality and interests that she's just waiting to dump on me; and I mean, if someone asked *me* "What are your deepest passions in life", I don't know if I'd find something interesting to say on the spot.
  - Asking "hey, can the conversation be about that subject and have that structure" is a very stilted way to go about socializing, and you don't want all your conversations with your SO to start out that way for weeks.

  What I'm getting to is, I'm looking for ways to drive a conversation towards the compelling, unique aspects of someone's personality without being overly structured about it. Anyone have experience doing that?

    The problem is, thinking about my first dates, the ones that were *really successful* (leading to 5 year + relationships), I don't have a clue what happened, only that I e.g. planned to meet a guy for coffee for 2 hours and we ended up talking for 8 hours straight about nothing in particular, just because we had good chemistry and built a rapport. Ditto with my now-husband, we met at a friend's party and both ended up talking to each other for 4-5 hours about god knows what (I think about atheism/the skeptic movement, this was circa 2007 so it was not as neckbeardy a thing to discuss then). 

    I had a "less successful" relationship that only lasted about 8 months and I remember finding it kind of awkward / not gelling perfectly. Then after our first date I managed to convince him to go roller skating with me, and we went roller skating and he was as inept as you'd expect a first-time roller skater, and then for some reason we made out in the car afterwards and it was.... it was furious makeouts... and that was what I credit with being the seed that gave the relationship its longevity. So you know? Just... be really good at smooching!

    I don't have any specific advice, I think having a few conversation topics in mind would be good - if you're getting dates from OKC still, make sure you don't talk about one of the parts of their profile that makes for a good conversation topic and hold that in reserve to have something  to discuss on the first date.

    Another general conversationalism tip is, when someone tells you what their job is, if your first thought is "wow, any idiot could do that job/it sounds so boring", go against that instinct and say "wow, that sounds like a difficult job, what's the hardest part?" - everyone thinks their job is difficult, and without fail whenever I ask someone with a "dumb" job this their eyes light up and they go and tell me about some aspect of their job that is really difficult and I get a new appreciation for it. This sounds kind of similar to your rationalist spark / "what makes you passionate" thing, but has the advantage about being about a very concrete topic that is also not very intimate.

      I'm mostly meeting grad students these days, so the equivalent question is "What are you studying", and most people don't really talk at length about that stuff; maybe it's because studying has a "mandatory but pointless" aspect, where people feel they have to be here but aren't really associating with what they're doing?

      Or maybe I'm just asking it wrong. I never tried the specific "This sounds hard, what's the hardest part?" question, but yeah, I kinda like it as a hook.

      > just because we had good chemistry and built a rapport

      Yeah, I get that.

      The thing is, I'm trying to find ways to cheat the system. I'm kind of operating on the assumption that I'll know my True Love when I see her, but in the meantime my dating life feels kind of shallow, so I'm looking for ways to emotionally connect with girls. Like, even if I can't get "great" chemistry, try to make it "good" instead of "passable".

    > I mean, I guess I could just tell my date everything I just said, but:

    > - It requires some social trust that's not always there

    Note how, in the list of questions linked above, most of the questions are casual, but, as the numbers ascend, intrusive questions become allowable. I haven't been on any dates, but it's obvious that you have to have a gradual ramp-up.

    > - It can grind the conversation to a halt; the girl I'm talking to doesn't *necessarily* have a pamphlet on her life and personality and interests that she's just waiting to dump on me; and[,] I mean, if someone asked *me* "What are your deepest passions in life", I don't know [whether] I'd find something interesting to say on the spot.

    I don't think that questions of such extreme abstractness are easy to answer for *anyone*. It's much easier to be concrete.

    > - Asking "hey, can the conversation be about that subject and have that structure" is a very stilted way to go about socializing

    Alternately asking questions of each other doesn't seem *too* stilted, as long as you don't go too in-depth on the topic of equality in the number of questions asked by both parties.

      > List of conversation topics

      As I mentioned last time that list came up, I think that kind of "roll a d20 to chose a subject" methodology makes for poor socializing. (also, some of these questions kind of suck; eg: "Where are your preferred borders between Europe and Asia?")

      But thanks :)

      > I haven't been on any dates

      Yeah, I think it's clear you're missing a frame of reference.

      Speaking from experience, alternatively asking questions of each other can get pretty stilted if you don't have a "spark". I think you don't realize how awkward these questions and your methodology would be on a date.

      Efficient socializing and dating requires adaptability most of all, and preparation quickly becomes counter-productive. It's an improv game; the rules are flexible, and in a sense, you need to figure them out in real time, which is part of why math/computer nerds are typically bad at it.

    ```
    Things that helped me with conversations (didn't try it on dates):

    * state something true about yourself (like I just watched Amazing Spiderman a second time and now I don't like it anymore.)

    * ask a question related to that (Did you ever dislike a movie/something after watching it again?)

    * follow up on answer (Oh, I never read the book, what is it about? Or Oh, than I better not go in that restaurant again, cause I liked it. Or I never enjoyed racing games in the first place. And yeah the answer will be all over the place.)

    * Repeat until you find conversation gold (Best the follow up is also statement about yourself and a question. If you get a question in return make your answer the statement about yourself and ask a question or let her time for a follow up question.)


    I like it cause it doesn't feel structured, even if it is structured. And you will give your conversation partner an opportunity to steer the conversation in a direction of her passions. 

    Just try it out with some friends (without telling them....  experimenting on unknowing friends is totally ethical) and choose topics you are not familiar with.


    And I wouldn't answer with my deepest passion on a date.

    Having insufficiently interesting 'conversation subjects' doesn't strike me as a real problem.  

    As you say, you could talk about your interests all day, so if you're having issues with communication it's got to be coming from the other party.  I'm making a guess from your other responses that you think conversation drives attraction, but I think this is wrong and that attraction drives conversation.  For example, I believe that if a girl were on a date with Ryan Reynolds (or w/e superstar), she could listen to him talk all day about his hobbies of 'watching paint dry' and 'killing hobos' and then walk out of it thinking she just connected with her soulmate.

    Good or bad conversation can influence how you connect with a person, but I fundamentally think the words don't matter.  Tone, vocality, body language, reciprocity, all that stuff is important... But the actually words could be nonsense.

    To directly answer your question about how you can have compelling, unique conversations with new dates?  Hit the gym, dress well, use skin care products, etc..

    TLDR; to use the cliche... be attractive; don't be unattractive.

  If you could take a pill that would make you happy with no side effects, would you?
  ```

  - u/Lightwavers:
    ```
    To what level of happiness?
    ```

    - u/xamueljones:
      ```
      Assume that it's to a reasonable level of happiness like the same level as when you wake up in the morning feeling great. Nothing to the point where it can be qualified to be wire-heading. People who take the pill can still feel sad if it's serious enough, but they find it easier to become happy and stay happy.

    Well, I've already taken pills with side effects in order to treat clinical depression, plus pills with side effects in order to treat seasonal affective disorder, so the answer is a definitive yes.
    ```

  - u/Norseman2:
    ```
    I don't believe the no-side-effects claim. If the pill is making you unreasonably happy, it's going to make you not care as much about things that would have reasonably made you unhappy. As an analogy, if you could take a pill which eliminated all pain, you'd fuck yourself up accidentally all the time because you wouldn't recognize that you're injuring yourself. If you get rid of your unhappiness with a pill, you'll neglect real problems in your life without realizing it.

    Of course, if you were unreasonably unhappy to begin with (i.e. clinical depression), then moving the other direction might be appropriate. Either you'll fix the problem and respond normally or you overcorrect and become unreasonably happy instead of unreasonably miserable, which is still a bit of an improvement.

    Oh my god, can we stop talking about the damn Basilisk? I swear it's like the worst part of The Game, the Doge meme and Schrodinger's cat combined. It's ten years old, and nobody cares except the people who care that others care.

    Twenty years from now we'll still get people saying "Hey, remember Roko's Basilisk? It's about this cult guy who..."

    EDIT: Sorry, that's too aggressive. I stick by the general point.

      > The Game, the Doge meme and Schrodinger's cat combined

      That's an interesting and pretty accurate description :)

      > and nobody cares except the people who care that others care.

      Sure, but isn't that kind of how our society functions? Without caring about what others care about, you would never be able to create and grow communities. The basilisk itself may be absurd or overmentioned, but it still provides an entry point into a way of thinking you're not normally exposed to. For example, thinking about whether you should care about simulations / clones of yourself as if they were you.

      And even if you hate every mention of it due to oversaturation, I still think it's nice since it shows the absorption of concepts originating from the "rational community" into popular culture. The mention in the show ([and reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/SiliconValleyHBO/comments/8e7xez/silicon_valley_5x05_facial_recognition_episode/dxtecjt/)) gave the corresponding rationalwiki article and thus the whole wiki public exposure, which I think is great. Just look at all those juicy things the wiki article links to that it might get people to read.

      I mean realistically, if you could have any mention of a concept you might see here on a comedy show in less than 20 seconds, what would it be?

  Let's do a thought experiment on writing, prompted by some recent interaction in this subreddit.

  Let's imagine an author who is discouraged by all feedback. They write content and post it publicly, but if there are any comments, no matter how positive, they find it harder to write. This attention fright doesn't apply to just posting the link somewhere, it's only real to them when they see comments.

  This author is posted to /r/rational and reads it personally and sees their own thread. The work they produce has a net positive and it gets considerable upvotes.

  Is it bad to leave a comment? Should we avoid doing so? Should any comments left be downvoted and be automatically hidden (which doesn't decrease the persons motivation)?

  Let's move it closer to a home, an author loses motivation from any comment that they can ever read as negative, and gains motivation from those that can only be read as positive. Think a very pessimistic person who automatically assumes everyone hates their story. Even the most well couched criticism will decrease their motivation to write. Again, their story is enjoyable to some people on the subreddit and they get some upvotes.

  Should you only comment positive things and downvote to hide the negative things? 

  And finally the most realistic case an author claims to be motivated by both positive comments and the nebulous "well" formed criticism, but demotivated by negative comments and "poorly" formed criticism, no one is sure what standard the author uses for this form of well and poorly.

  Should you risk commenting with criticism? Or stick with just purely good comments? There seems to be some quantity effect here where even 1000 good comments don't outweigh a single poor comment? Should you hope the author has the same mindset as the average /r/rational downvote weight and upvote/downvote every single comment to categorise it?
  ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    Personally, I think that feedback is valuable, but less valuable when it has little thought or charity put into it. e.g. "good" negative feedback being something like, "This chapter didn't work for me, because the fight scene didn't really seem to have much in the way of stakes, and it was a bit of a retread of something that happened earlier in the story", where "bad" negative feedback looks something like "This story is kind of shit. I don't understand the hype." (Both of these are paraphrases of comments that I've gotten in the past month.)

    More generally, I'm a fan of Slate Star Codex's comment philosophy, which can be summed up as any two of true, necessary, and kind. [See here.](http://slatestarcodex.com/comments/)

    To the problem at hand, if you feel that you might be writing a comment that might demotivate an author whose work you'd like to see more of, I would say that emphasizing "kind" is probably wise from a strict utility standpoint, assuming that your goal in giving criticism or negative feedback is to improve the work, rather than to publicly gripe about something that annoyed you and get it off your chest. This will *also* probably help to smooth the line of communication between yourself and the author, and help your voice be heard, so should be general practice even if the author hasn't expressed any particular reaction to negative feedback.

    (This goes double if there's a chance that you've misunderstood the author's intent, essential facts of the story, etc.)

    Note that the only rule this subreddit has is to the effect of being pleasant, and we *very* rarely give out warnings about people being unpleasant unless it's part of a persistent problem, community consensus, or something else. Bans are extremely rare for a community of this size, mostly reserved for the extreme cases. I recuse myself from all moderator action on stories that I write for (obvious) reasons of conflict of interest.
    ```

  - u/ceegheim:
    ```
    None of these. Ask the mods to post and enforce a sticky that actual discussion of the story is out-of-bounds, or is restricted to only positive comments. 

    And when commenting, always try to not hurt the author too much, at least if he/she hangs out here (critique can be kind or can be discouraging, depending both on tone and the author's state of mind).
    ```
