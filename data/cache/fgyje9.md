## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding and Writing Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*
* Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is *also* the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday Recommendation thead)

  Nobody? Let me think of something. Um. Damnit I have a great munchkinry question but that'll wait for Saturday (Note to self: the IQ question).

  WARNING: Ponies, but we're just importing an underexplored MLP concept onto modern society

  ------

  My Little Pony's lore has each pony having a 'cutie mark', which is a symbol reflecting their special talent they get on their butt at ~puberty. The cutie mark appears in dramatic fashion when you perform your "special talent" at the right age. So, for example, if you're really good at growing apples you'll get an apple cutie mark; writers a quill, photographers a camera, etc. I don't know canonically how well this is controlled: like, if you're born with your cutie mark ready to appear, or if it is determined based on what you actually do with your life, or if it's some combo of the two.

  How would human society be different if we had cutie marks? (Let's assume they're on the shoulder so we're not looking at butts all the time). I'd imagine they'd be part of job interviews, you wouldn't hire a wedding photographer who didn't have a camera cutie mark, etc. People would research the nature-vs-nurture of cutie marks, and if it's nature children would be pressured to do, I don't know, corporate synergy at age 12 so that way they can get a "synergy" or "team player" cutie mark? What about the kid who spends her teen years doing [regrettable thing], gets the associated cutie mark, and then beocmes a born again christian and has to live with the shame? Will there be scandals as politicians change their cutie marks to be more appropriate when they begin their careers? Will the enlightened nordic countries ban showing cutie marks in public?

    I think you would see different cultural camps:

    * Cutie absolutists, who think that cutie marks *are* what you are, and what you should be judged by, and any deviation from your cutie mark is just a temporary state before regression to the mark.
    * Cutie inclinationists, who think that cutie marks aren't who you are, just who you're inclined to be, and you should only be judged on what you do, not what you're *inclined* to do.
    * Cutie nihilists, who think that the cutie marks essentially don't mean anything at all, save for what meaning people give them, and all this bullshit about your cutie mark is a social construct.

    This assumes that things are muddled enough that it's legitimately difficult to tell which is actually true, though I think there's quite a bit of nuance even if the object-level truth is clear.

      In the absolutists/inclinationist camps There might also be a split between prescriptivist and descriptivists.  In MLP canon ponies often have narrow savant abilities relating to their talents, I.e. Rarities gem finding spell that funds her generosity and gives her raw materials for her fashion work.  If this phenomena exists their might be debate about its origin and connection with the marks.

      Prescriptivists might think the phenomena behind cutie marks also grants skills and increased learning ability relating to the mark.  They would point to examples like Rarity or Pinkie Pie, where the subject instantly shows skill relating to their mark (or near future about to appear mark) that they had no time to train in or develop talents for.

      Descriptivists might think that marks only indicate/hint at what might be developed or is “naturally” their they would point out that the “Rarities” that instantly manifest skills are extremely rare, the “Pinkie Pies” learn naturally but quickly through motivated hard work, and that many cases that prescriptivists point to are actually “Rainbow Dashes”: some initial talent followed by years of practice and hard work to first show the savant ability when they get their cutie mark followed by years more of practice after to regularly utilize their savant ability.

    In MLP canon, cutie marks often took a metaphorical or hidden meaning.  Applejack’s cutie mark represents her being true to herself by returning to her roots, in other words although it may literally boost her Apple growing ability, it also represents her honesty and common sense.  Likewise Cheerile’s Mark is 3 flowers and represents her students growth and not literal plant growing.  Twilight Sparkle has a mark representing her magic, but her true specialization in magic, the magic of friendship she didn’t discover about herself until years later.  The Cutie Mark Crusaders have helped ponies that misinterpreted their own mark.

    > Will there be scandals as politicians change their cutie marks to be more appropriate when they begin their careers? 

    I think politicians will heavily reinterpret their marks into palatable and presentable forms.  The scandals will be the cases where they outright lie about the how they got their marks.  “This bloody knife represents the time I acted decisively to save a friends life protecting them from wild dogs, not backstabbing.”  Followed by the story comes out from friends or family that they actually got it betraying someone during middle school teenage drama and then convincing a friend to help spread the wild dog story instead.

    > Will the enlightened nordic countries ban showing cutie marks in public?

    I imagine it would be a faux pass to interpret someone else’s mark and not take them at their word and probably illegal to outright discriminate based on marks.

    > People would research the nature-vs-nurture of cutie marks, and if it's nature children would be pressured to do, I don't know, corporate synergy at age 12 so that way they can get a "synergy" or "team player" cutie mark? 

    Probably easier for the parents to instead help their kid come up with a fictitious just so story that totally puts a different interpretation to the mark.

    > What about the kid who spends her teen years doing [regrettable thing], gets the associated cutie mark, and then beocmes a born again christian and has to live with the shame? 

    It would be direct proof that conversion doesn’t fundamentally change you, which would directly contradict fundamentalist Christianity’s claims, but hard evidence against them not stopped fundamentalists from shaming people (see conversion camps).  If anything I imagine the pressure would be to show off their “sinful” mark during testimonials and talk about how Jesus totally lets them resist... simultaneously lying to themselves and other people (similar to ex-gay testimonies).  I imagine countries that practice FGM might try burning marks off. 

    >  I'd imagine they'd be part of job interviews, you wouldn't hire a wedding photographer who didn't have a camera cutie mark, etc.

    Cutie marks are often metaphorical or abstract and can have varying levels of focus.  A party planning or artistic or fashion related cutie mark might be just as good as a photography cutie mark for indicating being good at photography for a wedding.  Whereas insisting on that camera cutie mark got you someone who got their cutie mark because they love going on vacation and taking lots of quick photos... with a minimal boost to skill actually applied to the photography part and lots of effort and skill put into the vacation planning part.  Meanwhile the perfect photographer has a ray of light mark indicating their ability to always get perfect lighting in their shots.

  there is a lot of dungeon fiction out there. yet no rules for doing it in D&D. making the dungeon a demiplane (similar to the shadowfel) would solve this and allow for dungeons to spawn and grow in the world, without worrying about whats physically in the location below the entrance. 

  from there, its a question of what limits are on how a dungeon can grow. using CR is one way, but for traps its down to the DC to spot are remove them. say each level has no more monsters than would let a party of 4 or 5 heroes level up. each level below they get stronger. the 'wandering monsters' can spawn out of the very walls if the adventurers wait too long in one spot. 

  in a world with such dungeons, what would be the rational response to them? destroy them while they are small and weak (lowest risk), farm them for resources and treasure, or just try to avoid them? eventually, after however many decades they may grow to the point they attach to a dungeon dimension which could allow travel between points.
