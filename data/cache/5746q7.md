  I read this a few weeks ago, highly recommended (though bringing [](#s "Steve Jobs") into it felt a bit off).

  I'm currently reading through the rest of her stuff, good world building. Going Pony is a good place to start, and I also enjoyed Caelum Est Conterrens some years ago.

  I enjoyed this a lot. One of Chatoyance's best stories, along with *Callum Est Conterrens*.

  It's funny, but her best Conversion Bureau stories are the ones which don't actually have the Bureau anywhere in them.

  Heya. A few months ago when I was going through some emotional things this story was exactly what I needed to read at the time.
