## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  I got the itch.io [Bunble for Racial Justice and Equality](https://itch.io/b/520/bundle-for-racial-justice-and-equality), which has approximately 1,700 games (available for approximately 12 more hours from the time of this post). Does anyone have recommendations for what's worth playing in there? Some of it is assets, or game manuals, or tools, none of which I care all that much about, and I'm sure a lot of the games are utter garbage, but the top 10% of the bundle would still be 170 games, which is *still* too many for me to look through, let alone play. Help/curation would be appreciated.

    ```
    Oxenfree: Teenagers on a haunted island. >!Ghosts and time travel.!< Has one of the most unique dialogue mechanics I've seen yet where you can interrupt the other person with your thoughts, or stay quiet whenever you like. Make sure you replay it!

    Night in the Woods: About a kid coming home to her dying small town after dropping out of college. It's about growing up, or refusing to, friends and family, and mysteries. Every character looking like an antropomorphized animal might be off-putting at first, but I recommend keeping at it.

    2064: Read Only Memories is a cyberpunk point&click with a charming cast. Really should get around to finishing it soon.

    Super Hexagon is a timewaster rhythm game with a kickass soundtrack that demands insane reflexes.

    Pyre is the only released Supergiant game I haven't played yet. It's a mix of a sports game with a visual novel in a fantasy setting. I was not a fan of the gameplay of the sports part, but the novel parts were amazing. Definitely wanna go back and finish this too.
    ```

  - u/NTaya:
    ```
    # Absolute must-try

    * **Pyre** is a game from Supergiant. 'Nuff said. 

    * * On a more serious note, it's a visual novel plus some fantasy basketball. The visual novel takes the spotlight, it's around nineteen hours long while the "gameplay" part is two hours sprinkled between those nineteen. 


    * * Choices Matter™—and they *actually* matter, at least in the last few hours. There are stakes, and there's no "golden ending" (even though some endings are obviously better than others).

    * * Visual design and music are outstanding, the story is intriguing, and characters are well-developed, with clear motivations and goals (even though some of them are rather clichéd). The writing is also top-notch. Par for the course for Supergiant, really.

    # Some games I liked, in no particular order:

    * **Celeste**: amazing but tough platformer. I'm biased here because I'm a huge fan of precision platformers, but I found this game to be my personal GOTY 2018. Both gameplay and design are very enticing.

    * **Minit** is a cute game with a unique gimmick: you only have 60 seconds. After that, you die and respawn keeping only the items you find along the way. It's pretty hard to describe, but I recommend giving it a try no matter if my description sounded fun or not—you'll know if you like it in under five minutes.

    * **Nuclear Throne** is a fast-paced, tough-as-nails rogue-lite. I'm pretty good at *The Binding of Isaac*, but couldn't complete this game even once in 10+ hours. Play at your own discretion. If you haven't played TBoI or *Enter the Gungeon* (both are not in the bundle as far as I know), you probably should try them out first, and only then give *Nuclear Throne* a shot.

    # "If you liked X, you might like Y" recommendations:

    * **Night in the Woods**: if you've ever watched *BoJack Horseman*, this is it, but for and about teenagers (another comparison that comes to mind is *Life Is Strange* if that wasn't a total cringefest). Also, there are mysteries. 
    The writing is quite decent, and the art style is pleasant.

    * **OneShot** is hard to describe without spoilers, but if you've played *Undertale*, this is it minus the toxic fandom (also, with a focus on puzzles instead of the deconstruction of the RPG genre).

    * **The Hex** is a game from the same creator as *Pony Island* with the same gimmick of heavily playing with meta. I personally liked it much less than *Pony Island*, but many people seem to enjoy it.

    # Honorable (?) mention:

    * **Highway Blossoms** is a kinetic novel (meaning it has no paths, you just read) about cute anime lesbians in American Midwest. I liked it, but it is definitely not everyone's cup of tea.

    # ProTip

    Many of the games from the bundle are on Steam, so if any catch your fancy, you can try checking out the reviews there.
    ```

  - u/Amagineer:
    ```
    These are all games that I've played and enjoyed to some degree:

    * If you enjoy platforming, Celeste is *very* good.
    * A Short Hike is a cute and relaxing adventure game about climbing a mountain to receive a call.
    * Spring Falls is a relaxing classic-style puzzle game (discrete, turn-based, has undo, gradually introduces new mechanics) where you must erode a mountain to water flowers.
    * Puzzle Puppers is a slightly-unpolished classic-style puzzle game, where you must feed very long rainbow corgis.
    * Mu Cartographer is a really interesting "You find yourself in control of an alien machine" sort of puzzle/exploration game. It's really interesting, and I have something of a soft spot for games like this, but it's definitely not everyone's cup of tea.
    * Particle Mace is a 2D top down action spaceship game (a la asteroids), wherein you must destroy things through irresponsible tractor beam usage, rather than shooting.

    There's also a bunch of TTRPGs included. I haven't played any of them, but Troika! and Lancer both looked really neat.

    * Troika! is a way out-there "science-fantasy" game, with a really strong aesthetic sense. It reminds me a lot of Caves of Qud, and also, a little of WTC in that the world is just sort of a bunch of stuff all munged together.
    * Lancer is about being a mech pilot, among other things.

    Here are some bonus meta resources for other people looking for the same things you are:

    * [There's a subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/itchioJusticeBundle/) dedicated to the bundle, and sorting through it.
    * Someone's also gone and built [a website](https://randombundlegame.com/browse) which provides a more comprehensive search over all the games.
    * There's also [a spreadsheet](https://www.reddit.com/r/itchioJusticeBundle/comments/h93fmk/spreadsheet_update_with_batch_7/) if that's more your jam.
    ```

    - u/IICVX:
      ```
      You shoulda put [that website](https://randombundlegame.com/browse) front-and-center at the top of your post, because it's probably the best tool for wrangling this unruly collection of games.
      ```

  - u/ansible:
    ```
    Wow, that is a lot of games.  You'll melt your Internet router downloading them all.

    I can only recommend one:

    Sky Rogue is a arcade-physics flying game, reminiscent of Crimson Skies. As soon as I unlocked the heavy fighter, I didn't bother with any other planes. My loadout is typically:

    * "heavy" micro missles (air and ground)
    * vulkan gun (ships and ground targets)
    * medium range air-to-air
    * guided bomb

    I still haven't finished the final level. Be sure to save up as much money as possible to buy repairs.

    I had my eye on Helium Rain a while back, but never bought it.

    I've only ever even heard of:

    * Octodad & sequel
    * Super Hexagon
    * Oxenfree
    * 2064: Read Only Memories

    I've got so many games from previous bundles in my collections that I'll likely not get around to playing... so I'll pass on this one to avoid clogging up my library.
    ```

  - u/Revlar:
    ```
    I've slaughtered time with Hyperspace Dogfights: Mission-based Luftrausers with a Binding of Isaac-esque upgrade system. Lots of flashing colors but it hasn't caused eye-strain for me yet.

    Bleed and Bleed 2 are very fun also. Newgrounds-ish action platformers with pretty good levels and bosses. Multi-jumps, a sword that deflects bullets and bullet time make it pretty fun to play, and it has some replay value in letting you unlock characters and weapons by playing harder versions of the levels.

    All three are action-y, with minimal story in Bleed's case. I'm not sure about any RPGs or Visual Novels on offer. Quality sway is extremely high with the amount of stuff in this bundle, and at least some of the games are unfinished.

    Would love to see what people with good filters can highlight from the whole thing.

    Edit: I've seen some of No Delivery played. I recommend checking it out if you enjoy weird RPGs.
    ```

  - u/jtolmar:
    ```
    Bolding things I've enjoyed that I've only heard about because of the bundle.

    * Celeste - Hard air-dash platformer. Probably the best pure platformer. Main game difficulty curve starts harder than the start of Super Meat Boy and ends easier than the end of Super Meat Boy, if that's a useful comparison for you.

    * Anodyne - Oldschool Zelda, but it's a journey into the uncomfortable parts of your mind. The combat is might be too tough for a lot of people, and the first dungeon is kind of dull, otherwise this would be an easy recommendation to everyone.

    * Tonight We Riot - Beat em up where you play as a crowd. Kind of reminiscent of Pikmin? Pretty challenging, but not punishingly so. It starts out pretty bleakly realistic, but by world two it becomes more of a cartoon. It's nice to play as the good guys.

    * **Golf Peaks** - Minigolf as a puzzle game. Very clever.

    * **Cardinal Chains** - A great abstract puzzle game, nearly as good as Hex Cells. The name and marketing copy really don't sell the game very well, so try the tutorial or trailer instead.

    * Nuclear Throne - Action game with quick death and big explosions. It's a Vlambeer game, that's what you get. Though it's not quite the screen shake explosionfest that Luftrausers was, they apparently have a little restraint.

    * Minit - Cute exploration/adventure thing where you only have 60 seconds to live, so you have to explore and make progress in short bursts.

    * Hive Time - Bee colony simulator. I had an enjoyable couple of hours playing it, but it doesn't really have anything that'd make me want to play more than that.  If learning a cute sim game (and it is *very* cute) sounds like fun, I'd recommend it. 

    * Super Hexagon - Abstract action game that's actually too hard for me. It is still very well-designed though, as you'd expect from Terry Cavanagh.

    And games I've heard good things about but haven't played yet: Octodad, Oxenfree, Starseed Pilgrim, Lenna's Inception, Night In The Woods

  Last weekend, I watched some murder mystery movies.

   * **Clue (1985)** is a parody of its genre, but still a pretty good mystery on its own right. Jokes are hilarious and the acting is great. Would recommend.
   * **Murder by Death (1976)** is also a parody and similar to Clue, just slightly lower in quality. Even though the jokes are little outdated, I really liked Sydney Wang.

   * **Knives Out (2019)**. Now this one is a must-watch. With all the satires, parodies and deconstructions of the genre, you would think whodunnit murder-mystery had already become a dead genre and you're right. But this movie alone almost revives the genre (I'm being hyperbolic here). It hits the ups and downs of story beats just right, has some well-timed twists and most importantly, the story is intricately plotted. Overall, I think this is right up r/rational's alley. Also from what I've read online, it seems to take a little [Artistic License](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicense) in law, but that is a very minor thing and nothing to upset the audience.
  ```

  - u/Bowbreaker:
    ```
    Seconding Knives Out. Personally, I wasn't left feeling with any "that makes no sense" type feelings, which have been all to frequent when watching movies lately.
    ```

  - u/Roxolan:
    ```
    *Clue* is the one that was released with different endings in different theatres, right?

    Which is a cool gimmick. But alas automatically makes it not a fair-play whodunnit, because it means the evidence provided to the audience is insufficient to narrow it down to only one possible answer.
    ```

  - u/Scilark:
    ```
    That's great to hear. I've been excited about Knives Out since I saw the trailer, and it's been high on my to-watch list. I think I know what I'll be watching next!

    Solid endorsement of all three being enjoyable.

  I've been getting into jumpchains lately (protagonist hopping between fictional realities), and I have to say... they're not that good. Since it's such a niche genre, there's not many recommended, and those that are read like bullet point lists. The only ones I've found that I've enjoyed are [Companion Chronicles](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/companion-chronicles-jumpchain-multicross-si-currently-visiting-breath-of-fire-iii.787978/) and [Nowhere Land](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/nowhere-land-jumpchain-multicross-horror.831104/). 

  I think there are three main problems with the genre: 

  First, it's small, so there's statistically a much lower chance of finding a good story. 

  Second, each "jump document" usually makes the character (far) above average for the world they go to, and it just keeps malking then more powerful as the story progresses. Overpowered protagonists are hard to write well, and the authors of these stories are usually fail at that. 

  Thirdly, the format specifies that the MC spends ten whole years in each fandom before moving on - this is longer than where most stories get to, results in an unrealistic lack character growth when the protagonist leaves the world much like they were when they started, and basically just turns the story into a sequence of isolated self-insert fanfics with a recurring main (or cast of) character(s). 

  I *have* read good(ish) stories with the fandom-dimension-hopping concept, though. See: [Sleeping with the Girls](https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5792734/1/Sleeping-with-the-Girls-Vol-I-Fictional-Reality), [Bond Breaker](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/bond-breaker-si-multiverse-cross.5951/), [Factory Isolation](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/factory-isolation-si-multicross.404479/), [Easy Mode](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/easy-mode-gamer-multicross-si.491065/). They circumvent my third gripe by not being constrained by "jumpchain" rules, allowing for less time spent in each fandom and the ability to travel between the worlds. They also get by my second by either simply not giving the character overpowered powers (former two) or by challenging them in ways such that their powers aren't so overpowered in the circumstance, or by shifting the tone of the story (latter two). 

  So, anyone have any recommendations for good fandom-hopping styled stories?

    There’s [Conference Call](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/conference-call-multicross.682117/#post-50859034), which is about a psychic link that spontaneously forms across dimensions between Roxy Lalonde, Zorian Kazinski, Ino Yamanaka, and Kid Win. It’s a Homestuck/Mother of Learning/Naruto/Worm multicross, if you couldn’t tell. It’s not quite fandom hopping but it might scratch that itch. It’s good, but it’s unfinished and been dead for a year so I assume it’ll stay dead.

    I think your point about the default 10 year timescale being too long to work like this is a good one. It can be done, but generally works much better on a shorter timescale, or the MC switching between worlds at-will.

    MTG Planeswalkers are a good example of the latter, and the majority of stories I've seen making use of it don't touch anything related to the MTG lore at all beyond the basics of Planeswalking and the magic system. They're generally worth checking out, though standard the trash-to-good stories ratio probably applies.

    A Planeswalker story I've very much enjoyed is the quest [Ignition](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/ignition-mtg-multicross-planeswalker-pc.26099/), where the main character becomes a Planeswalker at the end of the prologue. The settings she goes to (and is from) are fictional settings, but changed radically enough that knowing the settings is not only completely unrequired, but liable to lead you astray if you rely on canon knowledge. 
    Spoiler: >!The MC becomes pretty OP as a result of a few absolutely insane dicerolls on particularly critical checks* (The rolls happened in thread and can still be viewed - no fake rolls here.) There's still stakes, but she's generally at least a medium-leagues threat to all her available settings.!<

    >!*The most egregious example being an occasion relatively early on. The players got an opportunity where one of the options was schmuck bait. They swallowed the bait, which was almost guaranteed to lose them the opportunity, but then rolled a nat 100 followed by a confirmation roll with a 1/4 pass rate IIRC.!<
    ```

    - u/CircleWeasle:
      ```
      I'm torn on Ignition, I really enjoyed the start but somewhere around >!the magical lyical nonaha!< arc it got really meandering and the story seems to have gotten lost. The >!lost logia side plot!< really felt like just yet another ridiculous thing thrown in. 

      Overall it started strong but lost focus around that point and stopped being enjoyable (from my perspective) to read.

      Which is a huge shame, there are too few really good plainswalker fictions, plainswalker and D&D are some of my favorite universes to read about.
      ```

      - u/Flashbunny:
        ```
        The story did start meandering after a bit, it's true. The >!Lost Logia!< plot essentially got delayed, since >!the protagonist can "freeze" a plane in time relative to her and does so to the MGLN universe so she can come back when she's strong enough to deal with it.!<

        The author acknowledged that after a while and some crazy rolls the story changed from what it was intended to be. I still quite enjoyed it, but there is a moderate tonal shift.
        ```

  - u/ThePhrastusBombastus:
    ```
    I had a similar problem with finding good jumpchains after reading Nowhere Land.  I didn't end up finding any I liked, but I eventually found a dimension-hopping Worm/Gamer fic called [Kill them all](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/kill-them-all-worm-gamer.830187/).  It's not exactly high literature, but it's fun enough.  It starts off as a revenge-fueled murder fantasy, as the story starts with the MC's (Taylor's) father getting murdered in front of her.  Eventually she mellows out a little after unlocking a planeswalking power.  The catch with Taylor's planeswalking is that the dimensions she hops to are almost always apocalyptic/post-apocalyptic.  Think alien invasions, hordes of monsters, deadly plagues, and other awful nonsense.

    Currently, the universes traveled to include >!Fallout (presumably), Silent Hill, Attack on Titan, Resident Evil (movieverse), The Road, Independence Day, Hellsing Ultimate, and the MCU!<.

    Planeswalking seems to have given the MC a bit of perspective, and she's started using her powers to solve societal problems in ways that don't involve excessive amounts of murder, like registering patents where the royalties are funneled into disaster relief charities.  Well, she still seems to do a fair bit of murder too, but she's really cut back on it.

      ```
      This is one of my favourite subgenres! In (old) published fiction, I can think of:  
      \- The Mode series by Piers Anthony - amazing depiction of jumping through many dimensions. Loved it for this, though I always had issues with the way it depicted gender, and other problematic themes.

      \- The Lives of Christopher Chant (and to a lesser extent the wider Chrestomanci series) by Diana Wynne Jones deals with jumping through worlds in the multiverse. Intended for younger audiences but still an excellent series and I have no reservations recommending it.

      \- Also by Diana Wynne Jones, the Homeward Bounders is all about travelling from world to world.

      \- Nice Princes of Amber by Roger Zelazny (part of the Chronicles of Amber) has an amazing scene early on where the main character jumps through dimensions, although the series slows down drastically after its strong start. The series picks up again in the later books with more dimensional travel but you have to get through a long slow patch first, unfortunately. 

      \- The Myth Adventures series by Robert Asprin. A comedy series about a man from a stereotypical medieval fantasy world who accidentally becomes an inter-dimensional traveller. I love it.

      \- The Pendragon series as mentioned is another one. I enjoyed it, though each book in the series tends to focus on a single world at a time, whereas I'm more a fan of the rapid-fire dimension hops.

        That's like... Piers Anthony in a nutshell. Don't read his novel _Firefly_ if you want to maintain your good opinion of the man.
        ```

    - u/TREB0R:

      All I can think of is the young adult Pendragon series which had pretty cool worlds. I enjoyed them when I read them growing up, but I don't know how well they have aged.

      ```
      If all you're looking for is world-hopping, I'd highly recommend the [Death's Gate Cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Death_Gate_Cycle) - the Earth was magically split into four elemental planes plus a labyrinth, and the fairly epic seven book series traverses all of them. 

      It's only marginally rational; at the very least I don't remember getting mad at any characters for holding the idiot ball, but it's been like twenty years.
      ```

  - u/MayMaybeMaybeline:
    ```
    There's a similar mini-genre of  fandom hopping fics using planeswalkers from MTG as the main gimmick, which tend to have similar issues. My favorites are probably [well travelled](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/well-traveled-worm-planeswalker-taylor.377626/), starring taylor hebert, which is currently on its 4th jump, and [a saga of many planes](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-saga-of-many-planes-planeswalker-hinata-mtg-crossover.336114/) starring hinata hyuga in westeros, which died immediately into its second setting, but had a satisfying conclusion imo.

  Do any hard magic systems exist that are similar in complexity to the sciences which most historical conceptions of magic were based on past a high school/first year university level?

    You might like The Name of the Wind, by Patrick Rothfuss.  The magic system that we see most frequently is one of energy transfer between conceptually similar items.

  - u/VisineOfSauron:
    ```
    Are you familiar with Ars Magica, published by Atlas Games?  This is a game that has gone through several editions, and has a clear, coherent view of various schemes of magic.

    The main book covers the Order of Hermes - they have five Techniques - verbs to describe - Creo/Intellego/Muto/Perdo/Rego  - or Create/Understand/Change/Destroy/Control.   Then there ten Forms - nouns which are what's being manipulated:  Animal, Aquam, Aurum, Corpus, Herbam, Ignem, Imaginem, Mentem, Terram, and Vim.   Vim is magic itself, so to end a spell, you'd cast a Perdo Vim spell.  To control someone's mind is Rego Mentem.  To launch a fireball is Creo Ignem.

    Permanently changing something - such as magical healing - costs vis, basically concentrated magic. Securing supplies of vis is an important part of the game.  But the scheme has quirks - There's no spell to translate languages.  You can cast a spell on a foreign speaker and understand what he's saying, but you can't translate a document if no one in your group can read it.  The game calls out specific things that magic just can't do.

    Finally, and what really made this interesting, is that there are other magical traditions - some are extinct, some are neutral and some are enemies of the Order.  They have their own limits and can do things that Hermetics cannot.  With considerable effort it is possible to understand their magic and take it as your own, or simply do magical research to break new ground.

    >Haroun wonders how Bella's world gets by without the ability to directly tell how much Skill people have acquired.  How can anybody tell which academies are best?  How do guilds distinguish masters from apprentices?  Are there specialized guilds that do things like testing the cutting power of swords before they're sold?  It seems like you'd have to invest a lot more effort in that sort of thing if there weren't guilds certifying that people have acquired all necessary Skills to their required levels.  And wouldn't that tend to skew the incentives toward manufacturing goods with high immediate performance and less long-term durability?  Do hospitals spend tons of time and paperwork measuring which healers get the best patient outcomes, and wouldn't that give healers an incentive to only accept patients with better prognoses?  It's not like Bella's people can directly measure anyone's skill level at the trickier healing spells, and anytime a patient dies the healer could just claim they had an especially tricky case.  How do you verify that educators actually have the Social Skills for Teaching, rather than just being good at persuading people to believe they understood something?  How do you even figure out which Teaching Skills are the good ones - the ones that taught the greatest heroes - if there aren't any Skills?  Why don't their academies just degenerate into a lot of people airily waving their hands and pretending to teach things while actually uttering nonsense?  Bella's culture must have all kinds of fascinating adaptations to a reality where competence, fundamentally, cannot be *measured* except in special cases...

    This has to be one of the most—hm, how to put it—*Eliezer* paragraphs I've ever read.

  There's been a few people posting in previous weeks that they're jonesing for another [Isekai Speedrun](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21107/isekai-speedrun), and I've finally run across something similar! 

  [Jank](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/32291/jank) is a series of vignettes set in VRMMOs, mostly focused around the intersection of that full-body experience combined with the inevitable (title drop) jank of a system programmed by humans. 

  The stories are largely unrelated to each other (aside from Legend, which has two parts); each is more of a completely isolated story. The update schedule is pretty erratic as well.

  That being said, I found what's currently there to be very satisfying (particularly God Mode), and highly recommend giving it some of your time. The short story format is particularly well suited to web serials that might disappear at any moment, after all.

  [Heart of Cultivation](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/32502/heart-of-cultivation)  has been progressing well, though it's still in the early stages.  I never got into Xianxia for a large number of reasons, which this story gets around well.  For one thing, it's written primarily in English rather than being haphazardly translated.

  Many people here will recognize the author as being behind [Applied Cultural Anthropology.](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9238861/1/Applied-Cultural-Anthropology-or)

  I recently read [The Waves Arisen](https://wertifloke.wordpress.com/2015/01/25/chapter-1/).  It is very good as a rational fiction.  I'm still digesting how much I like it, but I think it's a comfortable top 5 of rational fiction.  It's been recommended here before, and I'm glad I took those recommendations.

  It does require a fairly extensive understanding of canon though.

  Here's what I've been currently reading, with some notes on each.  Many of these were previously recommended here.

  I've mostly been reading almost exclusively LitRPG recently... there's probably something wrong with me.

  ***Part 1: Must Read*** - actively following updates

  [Azarinth Healer](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/16946/azarinth-healer) - It's a standard numbers-go-up power fantasy, but I've really enjoyed it.  The protag has resisted getting involved in local politics, but seems headed there anyway, and is on a looming collision course with many of the existing power structures.  There was a very satisfying breakthrough in just the last couple chapters, and another is on the way soon.

  [Delve](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25225/delve) - updates are often posted here in /r/rational.  Interesting overarching plot, a bad guy who might not actually be too bad a guy, and heartwarming relationships between some of the characters.

  [Wake of the Ravager](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25878/wake-of-the-ravager) - Just the right level of farcical which I continue to find very amusing.

  [He Who Fights With Monsters](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26294/he-who-fights-with-monsters) - It could sort of be argued that the protag is turning into a Mary Sue, but he and his team have really earned their progress. Interesting plot with the protag plausibly involved in world-shaking conflict with gods and monsters from beyond reality.

  [I am going to die in this game-like dimension](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21844/i-am-going-to-die-in-this-game-like-dimension) - I found some the updates (especially after hub 2) to invoke a real sense of wonder and discovery for me.  Most authors are content to overlay magic over existing physics, but in this case, the fundamental nature of reality is quite different.

  [Purple Days - ASOIAF](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/purple-days-asoiaf-joffrey-timeloop-au.450894/) - this has been updating sporadically in the last year or so.  Nearing the conclusion, which should be pretty epic.

  [Skybound](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26149/skybound) - The author is quite capable of creating quite epic scenes (of battle and otherwise). Only updates about once a month though.

  [A Journey of Black and Red](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26675/a-journey-of-black-and-red) - Initially came across this through a crossover with Azarinth Healer, and then started from the beginning.  It's been fun so far.  The protag is starting to really come into her own at this point.
  ```

      The grammar and spelling of Azarinth Healer does leave much to be desired.  It doesn't look like the author is spending much time going back to fix mistakes as they have been pointed out.

      "Must Read" means that *I* must read the updates, not that they are necessarily "must reads" for people in general.

      As hinted at before, I've been obsessively reading LitRPG and the like recently. The only fiction I've read that is remotely close to "high brow" is "The Hydrogen Sonata" by Ian M. Banks, which finished off the Culture series for me.  It has been a long time since I read "Look to Windward" and "Excession", so those will likely get a re-read next year.  I've still got Echopraxia and the last Virga novel on my to-do list... though both of those are on paper, maybe I should just buy the electronic versions.
      ```

    - u/Do_Not_Go_In_There:
      ```
      I had the same problem. It's very jarring, and takes you out of the story.

      I'd give it a hard pass for anyone thinking of picking it up.
      ```

  - u/SpiritLBC:
    ```
    Yeah, Azarinth Healer and Randidy Ghosthound are appearing on people's recommendations lists and I just can't understand why. I read first 150 chapters of each novel and it felt like those were trying to replicate Chinese junk that's written just for the word count with extremely cardboard characters and inane behavior by everyone involved.
    ```

    - u/ironistkraken:
      ```
      Azarinth Healer is a very much a story were you turn off your brain and read because your just wondering when it gets good.
      ```

    - u/ansible:
      ```
      I hadn't heard of the 2nd one.

      Azarinth Healer is certainly not exemplary quality, aside from volume. And still I want to know what happens next.

      The whole list wasn't so much my recommendations, more just a list of what I'm actually reading, for good or for bad.
      ```

      - u/SpiritLBC:
        ```
        I understand that. [Here's one](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/11209/the-legend-of-randidly-ghosthound) that I'm talking about. You can check it out as it's litRPG which seems right up your alley. People on /r/noveltranslations are swearing by these two and Metaworld Chronicles, which I also find kinda dull.
        ```

  - u/jtolmar:
    ```
    Seconding the rec for Wake Of The Ravager. It's a dumb adolescent power fantasy but like the best possible version of that. The protagonist lucks into a bunch of overpowered abilities but doesn't rest on his laurels and instead continues to proactively work towards becoming more powerful, including experimenting, with some failed experiments shown. And the author introduces new story/setting/character/power elements at an incredible pace, very rarely goofing up and dropping them.

    In the same light, if lighthearted/violence/planning is an itch you want scratched, I'd also recommend [I Just Love Killing](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/i-just-love-killin-worm-rick-and-morty-crossover.446513/threadmarks) (Worm alt-power / Rick And Morty Crossover / Taylor gets advice from an alien assassin instead of having an actual power). It's incomplete and on hiatus, but the author shows up every year or so to update it, and it doesn't end somewhere unsatisfying.

    For more LitRPG, I'd recommend [Vainqueur The Dragon](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26534/vainqueur-the-dragon), a parody of the genre. It starts out very well done and funny, but slowly gets bogged down in longer buildups to less interesting jokes. But it doesn't hang any huge plot threads over the reader's head, so I'd still recommend reading as far as you get before getting sick of it.
    ```

    ```
    ***Part 2: Catching up slowly***

    [Patchwork Realms](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/30636/the-patchwork-realms-arrival) - Such a good boi!

    [Companion Chronicles](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/companion-chronicles-jumpchain-multicross-si-currently-visiting-breath-of-fire-iii.787978/) - Just started this recently.  Gets into the ethics of post-scarcity people getting involved with other worlds.

    ***Part 3: Stalled out but may continue***

    [With This Ring](https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-thread-fourteen.8938/) - Mr Zoat has seen his share of controversy, so I don't blame people for disliking it. Just haven't been too interested in it since moving to QQ.  As far as epic goes, few things can top the "Stars, Crossed" arc, and I don't even like Grayven all that much.

    [The Elemental Arena](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/27800/the-elemental-arena) - on hiatus until current real-life calms down.  Overall, it seems to me the time is a little too compressed, in that the entire series of events has taken place in like a day or two.  I'd expect anyone, no matter how mentally tough, would be a gibbering mess at this point.

    [Everybody Loves Largs Chests](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/8894/everybody-loves-large-chests) - not sure why exactly I stopped reading it around "Moonlighting".

    [Metaworld Chronicles](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/14167/metaworld-chronicles) - It is decent, I can't find any fault in it, but just lost interest.

    [Grand Design](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21216/grand-design) - Interesting premise.  Billed as hard SF, I can't get over how the inciting incident was described. >!I'm fine with spraying all of human civilization with hard gamma, but really, that is ionizing radiation, and the infrastructure would also be badly damaged. I may have to head-canon it as "subspace radiation" or something.!< I may still continue.

    [Animorphs: The Reckoning](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11090259/1/r-Animorphs-The-Reckoning) - I've only gotten to Chapter 7.  Some of the mistakes may by the protags have really bothered me.  Yes, I know, they're just kids.

    [Homicidal Aliens are Invading and All I Got is This Stat Menu](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/24203/homicidal-aliens-are-invading-and-all-i-got-is) - I started reading after the indefinite hiatus, so I knew it wasn't going to have a satisfying conclusion.  It is a decent LitRPG... I don't know.

    [The Eighth Warden](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26116/the-eighth-warden) - Stalled out at the end of Book 1.  We've only seen small hints of the overarching plot so far, book 1 was mostly harem building.  The protag is nearly perfect personality-wise... so not a lot of room for character growth.

    [Eight](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26734/eight) - It is nice, with cute animals and children, but didn't really hold my attention. Didn't see much of an overarching plot beyond survival so far.

    There's another one... I don't remember the title.  The protag is named K-something, and starts out in a goblin-infested valley which is the tutorial level.  Dying means starting over, and it had an unusual progression system.  There was an overarching plot line involving the player / protag's sanity, but I didn't find it very interesting.  No real sense of stakes to me.

    ***Part 5: Drop everything to read***

    Yes, of course I'm reading all the updates to Worth the Candle when they come out.
    ```

    - u/ironistkraken:
      ```
      The last one you are describing is called  "the perks of Immortality".
      ```

    - u/Watchful1:
      ```
      Grand Design is definitely worth finishing. For one it's actually complete, so the story doesn't drag on and it has a decently satisfying ending. I'm not sure I would describe the rest of it as hard SF either, but it's at least interesting.
      ```

    - u/SpiritLBC:
      ```
      Where is part 4?
      ```

      - u/ansible:
        ```
        I think LitRPG has rotted my brain, and I can't count anymore. ;-)

      The author of r!Animorphs addresses [*the* character's mistake here](https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/g3ka7e/oh_my_god_animorphs_the_reckoning_is_so_good/fntp3lr/?context=10000) [includes spoilers]. Not sure which other mistakes were bothersome. I think I can guess at one character >!who's a major source of dissonance at the start, but in hindsight, is a thematic keystone and adds that painfully human element to rationality that I love about the story.!<

      For litRPGs, I'm sadly the opposite. I've been having trouble getting into any. Are there any that aren't power fantasy sops and have some semblance of narrative and character development? For reference, I like Worth the Candle, The Wandering Inn, and A daring synthesis (and the start of Threadbare). I've tried Delve (might try it again) and will check out *I am going to die in this game-like dimension*.

    Also, the search parameters for **Previous automated recommendation threads** is spotty. The link doesn't search the Monday threads properly. The past few weeks' threads won't top the search results.

  Any RTS power fantasy? Usually we have isekai that are classic RPG power fantasy. You upgrade your stats, maybe a couple of companions and then the author is unable to maintain proper power levels and it degenerates.  


  I want stuff where we have distinct enemy factions and the protagonist upgrading and building fortifications and armies.  Stuff like world of Prime or Daniel Black ( besides his strange sexual themes).  


  Does this exist as a genre? Do you know any books in it?

    You want "dungeon core" stuff. Can't name anything specifically because I'm not really a fan of the genre though, sorry.

    Personally, I'm holding out for a grand strategy multiplayer power fantasy. Log Horizon sort of works, but unfortunately it's based off a fictional MMORPG. I just want to see "I got Isekai'd into Victoria 2, and now I have to form Grossgermany as Luxembourg while France and Brazil players partition china."
