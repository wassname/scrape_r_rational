## [HSF-ish] Eclipse Phase: A role-playing game of transhuman conspiracy and horror.

### Post:

Although this is a game, the rulebook itself contains a very well-realized setting. With the sole exception of the Exsurgent Virus, no piece of technology is sufficiently unexplained to be considered magic. The rulebook is available for free [here](http://robboyle.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/ps21000_eclipsephase_4thprinting.pdf)

  I played this with some friends at GenCon (with myself as the gamemaster). Mechanically, it plays a lot like Call of Cthulhu, which makes a lot of sense given some of their inspirations. It's got:

  * Uplifting
  * Brain copies
  * Effective immortality
  * Robot morphs
  * Existential threats
  * Grey goo scenarios

  And a whole bunch more. In addition to that, they put out a huge amount of content for free as PDFs (though the books are also amazing, and relatively cheap as far as these things go). In what other setting can you play as an uplifted whale? (Technically D&D lets you create one with the druid spell [Awaken](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/awaken.htm) and then possess it with [Magic Jar](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/magicJar.htm), but it's not the same, dammit.)

    I really like a lot of Eclipse Phase, but there's problems I have with it too:

    - The demographics and numbers and time-setting of the book are badly chosen and poorly thought out.
    - A lot of the rules are mechanically not very good. There's a lot of unnecessarily complicated chargen considering the central game conceits. A few of the mechanical subsystems are not very well put together. The combat is unncessarily complicated for how deterministic it ends up being.

    There's a lot to like in the setting and ideas, and the product itself's licensing, and the various suggested campaign elements. I suggest focusing on the awesome setting and theme elements and trying to avoid the actual rules as much as possible. Much like CoC in that respect.
