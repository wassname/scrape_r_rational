  I wonder if Alaya is going to force the third red letter? Maybe not immediately, but at this point she's definitely past the peak of her own personal influence/power. 

  At the same time I wonder if Scribe's action previously had any real influence on this result. Considering that Amadeus pretty clearly sees the current status quo of Praes even after reforms as being, well inefficient is one way to put it. But Alaya was probably going to be in this position of ambassador alongside the Dead King regardless of the plots happening in the capitol of Procer, so why was Scribe so insistent that Cat not tell him previously about this plotting. Amadeus was already going to be opposed to hitching their cart to the Dead King, and the contingencies that he mentions in this chapter. Alaya has been on this path for a long time, it goes against my instincts that Amadeus would be unable to see that if nothing else she's changed, been changed by the Dread Empress-ship-ness more than she's changed the position or the greater part of Praes.

    Scribe probably didn't know for sure that Malicia would attend, so it's better to close off all other ways.

    I predict that red letters & gnomes will have zero appearances in the remaining chapters of Guide.

    (I think they were off-the-cuff worldbuilding intended to hint at a deeper universe without actually interacting with the plot, similar to Atlantis in Methods of Rationality.)

  So how would this work, politically? In real life, if a bunch of foreign potentates accepted some new person as ruler of some country, then then that person would just be a powerless puppet ruler until he also gains de facto support in that country through an actual rebellion or invasion.

  But with narrative logic, this act should at least give Black a Claim on the Name of Dread Emperor, though that transfer of power wouldn't take effect until Malicia either dies or abdicates. What powers does a Claim on a Name give you? Did Cat gain any powers when she was fighting all the other Claimants for Squire? Also, Black will probably need to purge all the highborns since they'd never accept him as ruler, a move that the rest of the Grand Alliance would gladly join in on, given that the truce with the Dead King stays in effect. So the next arc will be civil war in Praes?

    > What powers does a Claim on a Name give you? Did Cat gain any powers when she was fighting all the other Claimants for Squire? 

    She gained a whole aspect (Learn) just from becoming a claimant, and gained Struggle during the fight with the other claimants in the burning building (she didn't gain the name until all the other claimants were dead, which was after she'd gained and used Struggle). So you can apparently get two whole aspects without even properly having the name if the narrative is in your favour.

    Well two different ways that jump to my mind one more historically based is the current government of Taiwan which was the previous Democratically elected government of Mainland China and which lost it's in UN seat as China, which isn't exactly the same thing, in more video game-ish terms in Crusader Kings while being the claimant to a position doesn't inherently have any power it gives well the claim which can then be backed up for the actual position.

    It's also a huge call out which is important as you say in the narrative sense, presumably if the challenge isn't met then the name is lost. Cat felt, uhh more, in the name dream which is probably proto-proto name, but even with a claim she has the ability to do necromancy and enhanced reflexes. i think she even gets an aspect pretty quickly, but that might only be, because of a lack of a current one we don't exactly have a lot of data.

      I wouldn't describe Kuomintang China as a democratic state lmao

      A better real-world example is today’s Venezuela, with the constitutional dispute over the presidency.

    Except Black already has support from Praes in the form of the Legions of Terror.

    look up guaido in venezuela right now. he has more international recognition than the de facto president, maduro, but he had a fraction of the power because he hasnt been able to get the army on his side.

    Since the Accords prohibit Named holding office, I don't think he is going to get or accept one.
    ```

    - u/OmniscientQ:
      ```
      Black has pointed out to Catherine why that won't work at all, in the long run, and Cat has grudgingly acknowledged it herself. The "No Named Rulers" clause of the Liesse Accords is as good as dead. But if Cat makes a big fight over it during the negotiations, she can give up that clause and the rest of the delegates will think they shouldn't push her any further on the rest.
      ```

      - u/rabotat:
        ```
        Prediction time!

        I'm betting Catherine fights for and keeps her "No Named rulers" clause. 

        I'll also go on a limb and say Black will not take a Name.

        Also at some point Cat will abdicate and Vivi becomes a ruler of Callow.
        ```

        - u/Banarok:
          ```
          the last point is such a easy prediction it's like saying "they'll fight the dead king" it's pretty obvious, Cat have numerous times said how much she hate actually ruling, she hates courtesies and don't see the point of most luxuries.

          as soon as Callow is stable she'd throw everything to be somebody else's problem.
          ```

            I agree, but still. It may be a curve-ball and it is relevant to my first point.
            ```

  ```
  "Parts of the League’s delegation – Atalante, Nicae – were dismayed by the sudden revelation, but others largely indifferent."

  So the book of all things nailed to a board looked dismayed? The dead king really IS a bad guy.
