## [Biweekly Challenge] Metafiction

### Post:

## Last Time

[Last time](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6r8w0o/biweekly_challenge_eschaton/), the prompt was "Eschaton". Our winner is /u/blasted0glass, with their story, ["Waste Heat"](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6r8w0o/biweekly_challenge_eschaton/dl9a3ww/). Congratulations to /u/blasted0glass on another win!

##### This Time

This time, the challenge is **Metafiction**. Write a story which in some sense acknowledges that it is a story. Characters realize that they're in a story, or simply accept that as fact. There's *some* overlap with genre savvy, though genre savvy characters don't typically realize that they're in a work of fiction, they've just seen enough fiction to not fall for the usual traps. Remember that prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

The winner will be decided **Wednesday, August 30th.** You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

##### Rules

* 300 word minimum, no maximum. Post as a link to Google Docs, pastebin, Dropbox, etc. **This is mandatory.**

* No plagiarism, but you're welcome to recycle and revamp your own ideas you've used in the past.

* Think before you downvote.

* Winner will be determined by "best" sorting.

* Winner gets reddit gold, special winner flair, and bragging rights. Five-time winners get even more special winner flair, and their choice of prompt if they want it.

* All top-level replies to this thread should be submissions. Non-submissions (including questions, comments, etc.) belong in the companion thread, and will be aggressively removed from here.

* Top-level replies must be a link to Google Docs, a PDF, your personal website, etc. It is suggested that you include a word count and a title when you're linking to somewhere else.

* In the interest of keeping the playing field level, please refrain from cross-posting to other places until after the winner has been decided.

* No idea what rational fiction is? [Read the wiki!](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index)

##### Meta

If you think you have a good prompt for a challenge, [add it to the list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B6HaZc8FYkr6l6Q4cwBc9_-Yq1g0f_HmdHK5L1tbEbA/edit?usp=sharing) (remember that [a good prompt is not a recipe](http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/prompts?src=RECIPE)). Also, if you want a quick index of past challenges, I've [posted them on the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/weeklychallenge).

##### Next Time

Next time, the challenge will be **Effective Altruism**, partly because Effective Altruism Global 2017 has recently ended. Effective altruism is, in short, using your resources to do the most good. See [this introduction to effective altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/introduction-to-effective-altruism/) if you'd like to know more. I happen to think that this is fairly fertile ground for speculative fiction, namely by thinking in terms of "how does an effective altruist react to [THING]", where [THING] is a portal to a fantasy world, superpowers, the Death Note, etc. As always though, prompts are to inspire, not to limit; feel free to do your own thing.

**Next challenge's thread will go up on 8/30.** Please private message me with any questions or comments. The companion thread for recommendations, ideas, or general chit-chat will be posted later tonight.

    I tried and this is what I understood:
    Hronar is, obviously, a rationalist, talking to a man (another storyteller, perhaps a non-rational one).  

    Up until he goes to the temple, he's being a rational player but one unaware of being in a (real-life) story.  

    The book of poetry spurs him on to read and then write fiction, which helps him predict his own story and make difficult things easier to plan for.  

    Any corrections?  

    My questions:  
    Is there any significance or symbolism behind the character of the other man? 
    Is he an Elder God or something, who is wondering how Hronar has been as successful as he is?

      I think you got most of the points.

      What I would add is that beyond "making difficult things easier to plan for", Hronar actively improves his situation in ever-more munchkin-esque ways, which leads him to the current situation in which he lives in a more modern and luxurious way. He declines to describe that journey to his associate, calling it a long story.

      Though I've never put this in the text, and you're therefore free to disbelieve this, "word of god" on that journey would be that Hronar fully escapes his Bronze Age Fantasy reality by using his meta-knowledge to make the plot more and more meta. Think about it: If the story becomes about his knowledge about stories, there has to be some sort of climactic achievement regarding knowledge about stories, and him escaping reality fits the bill, especially if he arranges for subtle foreshadowing to that end.

      But where is he *now*? Well, I imagine he is in some place where others have ended up through similar journeys (which is why the guy he's talking to expects his story to contain him realizing it's a story). So I'd say that although the story doesn't state it, the other man is a fellow meta-aware protagonist of another story.

      For the record, I don't think that it's a good idea to leave so much unsaid in the story, yet declare it canon, but I never really took *Hronar* too seriously. I wanted to poke a bit of fun at the concept of a rationalfic by making the classic barbarian hero, perhaps the most unintellectual of fantasy stereotypes, an absurd munchkin.

      Thank you for reading, I didn't think that people would check in on such an old challenge :)

        Heh. I bet Tolstoy didn't think that we'd be reading him after so many years either... I enjoyed the story, and thank you for pointing out the munchkinry; I skipped over it without realizing the importance of it... It's easy to forget that its the small things that lead to bigger things being possible - like being able to Google better gets you better reading material and puts you ahead of some other people around you, which leads you to becoming the person whom difficult questions are brought to, which leads you to knowing more about esoteric things and resources... And the cycle continues.
