  ```
  I love how she brought a flask with her on her potential charge to her death. Also how familiar Abigail is with living with expectations upon her that are outside of what would be reasonable for her to actually do.
  ```

  - u/RynnisOne:
    ```
    She probably has multiple flasks.  Just as a goblin carries numerous mines (or sapper charges), Abigail comes prepared with backup flasks, 'just in case'.
    ```

    - u/anenymouse:
      ```
      I'm just really enjoying the implications of her being driven to drink from the situations that she ends up in based on her own attempts to be just good enough to not die and not draw notice to herself. And of course the delicious Irony that each attempt brings her greater glory and equally great danger.
      ```

  - u/signspace13:
    ```
    Greatest thing about her character is that all she has to do to be out of danger is fail, but by the time she has siked herself up enough to fail and thus escape danger, she is immediately promoted to a higher level of responsibility at which her failure would mean even greater consequences. She is a continuous balance between her sense of self preservation and her morals, and before the former can win the latter is just pushed harder to perform. 

    This wouldn't be nearly as interesting if she wasn't *competent*, she is almost always capable of the things required of her, she just isn't willing to believe in herself. She thinks she isn't humble, and she isn't, self deprecation isn't humility, that her deeds are over blown due to the involvement of others, but all of the things she is known for have had her direct influence in their success, I'm just wondering if she will be the first ever *Bumbling general*.
    ```

      It's also part of being named in a story, presumably there are tons of desk jobs and administrative positions that are filled, but she's stuck in Cat's orbit and is getting pulled into a lot danger just by being close to her. As she's said, she could have been safe as a tanner (?) But instead she's out trying not to die, and trying not to die is usually pretty good when we've seen and heard others dying in similar positions.

  ```
  >The Sicorat, on the other hand, was not a Miezan history but a Baalite one. Amadeus’ passing knowledge of tradertalk had him suspecting the meaning of the title was something along the lines of ‘Foe-Tale’, which was an apt summation of the relations between the Hegemony and the Empire during their shared span of history. 

  Wait a second...

  >Amadeus did not speak any of three major Levantine dialects, or even the Baalite tradertongue they’d been influenced by. There had been no need, and so many other things he had to learn.

  smh my head, EE. So inconsistent. /s

  - u/werafdsaew:
    ```
    Well "passing knowledge" isn't the same thing as being fluent in it.
    ```

- u/BaggyOz:
  ```
  Abigail is just the best. She almost manages to beat Ciaphas Cain when it comes to Ciaphas Cain-ing.
  ```

  - u/anenymouse:
    ```
    I love that she's the kind of character that from the outside looking in without the context of her thoughts she's almost a Mary Sue, but with the context that she really doesn't want to be as successful as she is and that every success puts her further out of her comfort zone and into danger that she wants to avoid at all costs.
    Like her thinking of the safest racist statement to the Grand Master where something that might put her in danger would probably be the simpler way to get removed from her position.
    ```

  - u/RynnisOne:
    ```
    She hasn't bested a Space Marine in swordplay, singlehandedly stopped an Orc *Waagggh*, or put a bullet through the brain of a trusted companion because they might be infected by Genestealers.

    She's awesome, but not *that* awesome.  She's kinda like Ciaphas Cain's little sister.
    ```

    - u/BaggyOz:
      ```
      Feats are not what make Ciaphas Ciaphas. You can get that from plenty of other Black Library books.
      ```

      - u/RynnisOne:
        ```
        Feats are indeed what make Ciaphas.  Having the attitude isn't helpful if you don't have the skills and luck to survive, and he's been through a lot more than she has.  Can totally see her being in the same family, though.
        ```

        - u/BaggyOz:
          ```
          Gaunt also has feats but he is nothing like Ciaphas. It is not feats that define Ciaphas' character. His career is defined by feats but his character is not. His character is defined by wanting to avoid the circumstances that lead to feats. 

          He thought being assigned to an anti aircraft regiment behind the frontlines was a plum assignment. He tried to stick around the sector HQ and the Lord General as much as possible. He constantly places himself with squads that he thinks will see the least fighting. His approach to discipline is focussed on not giving guardsmen a reason to shoot him in the back. When he throws himself into a dangerous situation it's because he thinks he's dead if he doesnt or it's because he doesn't want to deal with a pissed off Inquistor.
          ```

- u/TrebarTilonai:
  ```
  I haven't seen this it phrased this way in the comments anywhere, but Abigail seems to be the living embodiment of "if you want something done right, give it to a competent lazy person". Except in this case it's "if you want brilliant military strategy, give it to a competent coward".
