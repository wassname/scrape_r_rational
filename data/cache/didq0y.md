  It's also how I've always imagined the most canonical Lex. That's why MetMan is so thrilling, as is [Lex Luthor Triumphant](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8700173/1/Lex-Luthor-Triumphant). He's even more consistently characterized than the big blue Boy Scout.

    I'd add [Inviolate](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5536346/1/Inviolate) to that list.

      I mean, sans the wanton cruelty towards superman I found the tale quite good. Superheroes are a quite sad state of affairs for humanity.

        And yet, Luthor is not replacing them with something much better.

          He did. Technology that can be used and shared and built upon by everyone instead of hoarded?
          ```

            Except that no one understands how it works and it's not replicable; production relies entirely on the continuous extraction of tissue from Superman and whatshername from the Phantom Zone. It can't be shared easily, and it can't be built upon by anyone, even LexCorp. It's Syndrome's plan from the Incredibles, but even more fragile and single point of failure.
            ```

              ```
              ...have you read the story to the end? 

              He stops skinning superman after a while, after his 'technology surpassed his natural gifts'.

      Honestly I wish they did more DC Vertigo crossovers. The Vertigo universe has so much better deep lore.

    She found him interesting to talk to... and mostly sunday02’s point above.

    Probably because (spoiler) >!he temporarily becomes a nigh-omnipotent god at the end of this storyline and has to decide what to do!<.

  I'm willing to be that other nerds have also come to the conclusion that Lex Luthor's ideal paradise was to wake up and outsmart death, so that's the one he was slotted into. He's dead, yes, but so is almost every other conceivable iteration of luther, nested fractally upwards to the first time he got killed yet wanted to stay alive and downwards to all future death-and-revival sequences he'll go through.
  ```

  - u/Croktopus:
    ```
    i mean. he didnt really outsmart death tho. but overall the point could work
    ```

  - u/GeneralExtension:
    ```
    He wanted to live.

  What is the 'Big Hand Theory', and why does it make atheism an ethical choice in his universe?  <curiosity and confusion>
  ```

  - u/DrMaridelMolotov:
    ```
    The Big hand Theory isn’t really a theory as it is fact. Basically the Presence (God) created the universe by unfurling his hand and this is literal as in an episode of Justice League GL and Batman go back in time to creation and see a hand creating the universe. So pretty much Big Bang Theory. As for atheism being an ethical choice it’s just the standard why does God allow evil and not help people. In this case Lex has a point because he knows there is a higher power but it refuses to do anything. Also the Presence kind of abandoned the DCverse choosing to explore other multiverses. Michael’s daughter is in charge now (or a group of humans I think now). On the bright side there is a definite Heaven and Hell so I guess that’s good.
    ```

    - u/MultipartiteMind:
      ```
      I see!  Thank you!  That (saying deities do exist and that they do not deserve worship) is very different from what I imagined 'atheist' might be used to mean.  Hm, maybe '[misotheist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misotheism)'?
      ```

      - u/VorpalAuroch:
        ```
        If you acknowledge the existence of entities more powerful than you, but [not their claims to divinity or the moral authority that comes with it](https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-story-only.8961/page-4#post-2427441), you can be justifiably called an atheist.
        ```

        - u/MultipartiteMind:
          ```
          Intriguing!  Logically equally valid, but do I understand correctly that this is a minority-perspective linking of godhood with moral authority?  'divine' (from 'divus'/'deus') just means 'godlike' and so is self-referential, but in most of the stories I remember coming across about things called gods, there are usually lots of them with inhuman levels of power but at odds with each other and often reflecting humans' worst excesses--claims of moral authority being associated being an occasional add-on (monotheistic cases where a religion worships a single hypothetical entity with no internal conflicts exclusively?) rather than a rule.  


          (And then you get religious wars if groups start saying "Your stories' 'gods' don't have essential quality X of our gods, so they are not TRUE gods!  You should worship the true gods with us!" and "No, your stories' 'gods' don't have essential quality Y of our gods, so they are not TRUE gods!  You should worship the true gods with us!"  in the No True Scotsman fallacy.  Or actually even more commonly just "Our stories are true, but yours are made up!  Stop telling them!" "Nuh-uh, yours are the made up ones!  Stop telling them!"...)
          ```

        ```
        TVTropes uses the term "nay-theist" and says that the technical terms are "alatrism" for just not worshipping the gods and "misotheism" for actively hating them.
        ```

    - u/VorpalAuroch:
      ```
      It's not known to be the Presence, IIRC. In some versions it's Krona. (In the Marvel universe, it's a time-traveling wizard named Siseneg.)
      ```

- u/hyphenomicon:
  ```
  I don't like Death or the other Ds at all. I don't know why they're so popular.
  ```

  - u/DrMaridelMolotov:
    ```
    A lot of people really liked the Sandman series. Later on they were worked into the backbone of the DC universe setting up a cool lore within the multiverse DC has which is more consistent than Marvel’s.
    ```
