  I can't say I'm surprised that this is ending in Piccolo being released, but it was still a fun road getting to this point. I'm curious to see how Piccolo is in this fic, since if I recall the original was basically a Saturday morning cartoon villain who did evil for the sake of being evil. I can't imagine the author is going to stick with that original characterization given the tone of this fic.

    To be fair, original Piccolo was literally evil made flesh. More interesting, I think, would be to consider exactly what kinds of evil the Son of Katatsu had to cast off to become Kami. It isn't strange for people to have feelings and temptations that conflict with the core of who they want to be, sometimes with a reasonable explanation behind them, others with mere carnality or consequence of chemical wonkiness. What in the world was going through proto-Kami's mind, that he was willing and able to take on the role of Earth's Kami, but that his ejected evil became Piccolo?

    Original Piccolo seeking power, and pragmatically killing off his biggest threats, I can see coming from Kami. What about the support for anarchy and generalized violence and destruction? There's a solid core there, maybe, but it's, as you say, too cartoonish to trace back conceptually. Given how Shenlong and Enma have been depicted, I am certainly interested to see how Kami is characterized, here, and in a sense, Piccolo should be a hint at pre-ascension Kami.

      The idea of "the guy who became guardian of earth cast off all his evil and it became a person of its own" is a really interesting premise for a character, definitely. What sort of mindset would a person like Piccolo actually have? If he has all of Kami's memories up to the split, what does he think of them? Does he think of himself as Kami's cast-off junk, or is he convinced that Kami is the junk? There's plenty to explore there, especially after Piccolo has been active for long enough to diverge more thoroughly from his original state.

      If the Son of Katatsu was mostly a good person, the evil he cast of might not be very substantial. Some animal instincts, selfish impulses and uncouth desires maybe - only the scraps of a person, not a full personality. That would explain how he functions as a cartoonish villain, since there really isn't much depth to him as a person. 

      I also gives him plenty of room to grow into a more complex and nuanced version of himself later on. That very well might make him more of a good person, as happened in canon, but not necessarily. If he was conscious in the prison, he might have grown and evolved in entirely new twisted ways.

    What I did with Piccolo is a bit special - I think of it as keeping him *mostly* like he's in canon but with a twist that makes it more, well, rational and that will be developed throughout the arc. I won't get into details and next chapter it will make more sense to discuss it, at least his initial characterization.

      Great!

  Definitely a bit of a cliffhanger and I’m looking forward to the next chapter!

  ```
  great chapter as always, but I have one worry

  >!isn't Flute too powerful? he seems unstoppable with his ability. I have the same feeling about the paralysis of Chiatzu. Maybe they power limit should be more clearly stated in text because they both now seem sooo OP!<
  ```

  - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
    ```
    Fair worry. The limits will be soon shown but here they are:

    >!For Chiaotzu, same as canon, he must stand still, can only use it on one target at a time and can’t be someone stronger than himself - it’s a telekinetic lock, not mind control, and can be overcome by brute strength. For Flute it’s one target at a time and needs some degree of continuity. Not constant eye contact, but if he gets too far from the target for too long, or loses consciousness, the control is broken.!<
    ```

    - u/Dezoufinous:
      ```
      Ok, so I have a question, let's assume they will somehow get to the higher real (by dying or other way if possible), will their power affect the King of All or how is he called?

      Second question: can they para/control Frieza?
      ```

        Answers:

        >!1. No, powers like these are inherently tied to the body and its ability to manipulate, shape and project ki/magic. The soul alone can't use them, so the dead don't possess them. Also, the King of All - or his equivalent in the alternative continuity of this fic - has power on a completely different level. Divine ki in general is a different thing from the stuff normal mortals wield, this applies also to the Kais. It's like having admin privileges. See how in Dragon Ball Super even Goku in his SSJ3 form couldn't lay a finger on Beerus. It's not just a quantitative difference, but a qualitative one - at least that's how I interpret it. I know that in canon this does not apply to the Kais, apparently, but here I invoke my power to retcon whatever the fuck I want when I think it doesn't make sense.!<

        >!2. No, neither of them. Chiaotzu's control would be broken by sheer power. With Flute the ki gap is also just too big. Consider that magic and ki are two sides of the same coin, ki used for fighting is just a more raw, unpolished form of it that simply strengthens or destroys instead of achieving subtler effects. But you can still use it to shield yourself from magic effects if you have enough of it. It's inefficient so you must vastly outstrip the "attacking" force but it's possible. Frieza wouldn't be turned into a carrot by the rabbit dude who died in chapter 3 either.!<
