  I couldn't really think of a good way to tell the next part of Hermione + Twilight's story in words, so I opted for a different medium. I expect that I'll release two-three pages or so along with each written chapter for the next ~5-10 chapters.

  Previous Chapters: 

  [Chapter 1: One Small Thing](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12825305/1/The-Longest-Day)

  [Chapter 2: Reflections](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12825305/2/The-Longest-Day)

  [Chapter 3: I'll Be Your Mirror](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12825305/3/The-Longest-Day)

  [Chapter 4: The One Where Twilight Sparkle Dies]
  (https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12825305/4/The-Longest-Day)

  Okay... we know Hermione's an alicorn at the moment because she copied Twilight's body plan, but if she comes back to life as a pony, will she continue being an alicorn because she's now survived death?

  (I guess the reason for her to be a pony would be if she decides Atlantis aka Equestria is so fascinating she wants to visit and research there herself.  She probably wouldn't stay long if Harry's still on Earth, though.)

  On another note, which Element maps to which?

    Questions that will definitely be answered as the story goes on... :)

    As for the Elements, the mapping is as such:

    Generosity/Beauty -> Space (Mirror of Noitilov)

    Honesty/Strength -> Power (Philosopher's Stone)

    Laughter/Hope -> Time (???)

    Kindness/Healing -> Life (Deathly Hallows)

    Loyalty/Bravery -> Mind (???)

    Magic/Sorcery -> Love (Friendship is Magic!)

    The Element of Mind and Time will have brief cameos in the upcoming chapter.
