  This "psychic" is probably Mewtwo, right? His ability to lie perfectly to Sabrina using partitions was mentioned before, as well as him interacting with a number of psychics and psychic Pokémon. The question is how did Sabrina find out? Since he is a perfect liar, Sabrina shouldn't have known this unless he told her himself.
  ```

  - u/ManyCookies:
    ```
    He escaped, tried to escape, or otherwise acted in a way super inconsistent with what Sabrina saw. Hence the emergency!

      > Escape

      Possibly linked to Zapdos moving over Cinnabar... but that was weeks ago.
      ```

      - u/ManyCookies:
        ```
        Pressure could well interact with Mewtwo in an interesting manner, he *himself* has Pressure in-game, and that could've spurred a later escape attempt. Though I thought Karen managed to lure Zapdos hard south and away from Cinnibar before she was shot down.

    I suspect that she kind of just suspects it, rather than knowing it outringht. It also makes sense that she was seeing him over the course of his life, as he developed his abilities and learned, so from her perspective previously she may have gotten fragments of deeper feelings before his shield was perfected and now she no longer does, leading her to suspect he may be perfectly shutting her out.
    ```

    Honestly, I’m still not entirely convinced that the psychic isn’t Red, and this isn’t some sort of weird long game. Like, it just matched his experience so perfectly, and then the ominous pause at his question...
    ```

  - u/DonaldShimoda:
    ```
    Honestly, I think it's Red. I think his partition with past and future Red is stronger and more unique than he realizes. I might be missing something though
    ```

      I doubt it, since he's apparently not the best at partitions, it's possible he's just somehow ignorant, but seems a little unlikely.

        It could well be that Sabrina took on Red as a student because of her suspicions about Mewtwo forming a perfect partition. It gives her a chance to study one that isn't *quite* perfect, and Mewtwo isn't exactly as happy to work with Sabrina as Red is.
        ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      The partition thing made me suspect it was Red, but Red himself doesn't know, and I doubt he managed to make a perfect shield without knowing – although this isn't impossible. Also he put up his shield in front of Sabrina during the meeting – possible foreshadowing?
      ```

    - u/zeekaran:
      ```
      I just caught up, pardon my tardiness. Red seems to be great for a twelve year old, but the only reason he has Sabrina's attention is because he created a new psychic skill. He's not insanely talented--in fact he's probably worse than other twelve year olds with everything else regarding psychic ability. Mewtwo is the special one here. Red is not a chosen one Hero Protagonist.
      ```

- u/ManyCookies:
  ```
  Awww shit something happened with Mewtwo, the timing of the emergency and her realization of M2's deception line up too well. 

  The obvious guess is Mewtwo escaped, which'd explain why Sabrina's on a mission of undetermined length, but this'd be a strange priority when the superweapon's out of the cage. Perhaps Mewtwo *attempted* escape or otherwise showed total unreliability, and Sabrina's tasked with probing M2's mind or running psychic interference or something?

  (Also it's unclear why Sabrina thinks Mewtwo has some theoretical perfect shield, isn't "Mewtwo's a way stronger psychic than me" enough of an explanation?)

  ---- 

  Speaking of psychic impossibilities, an interesting line on teleportation way back in ch43:

  >Some even claim that strong enough psychics can go with their pokemon to places only they have been to, but if so none have made themselves available for testing.

  Calling a shot: Mewtwo reverses that line of thought and escapes (in part) by teleporting with an unwilling human to a place only that person has been!
  ```

    > Calling a shot: Mewtwo reverses that line of thought and escapes (in part) by teleporting with an unwilling human to a place only that person has been!

    Yep. Mewtwo is the first and only psychic Pokémon who can both merge his mind with a human, *and* doesn't need to obey command and has independent intelligent thoughts. So maybe the Cinnabar Lab won't expect this reversal.
    ```

  - u/The_Magus_199:
    ```
    Honestly, I think it may be more likely that Red is just specialized in the more mental sides of psychic power, and something about his mindset isn’t right for telekinesis. Like, modeling and partitions and stuff all mesh with who he is in a way that moving stuff with his mind kinda doesn’t?

    >It's interesting that most of the psychics are teenagers, though

    Besides Rei likely being older like you pointed out, I thought Tatsumaki would be 28 like she is in OPM. She's just short.

    Checking the chapter plenty of their ages were mentioned, so listing them out it's:

    Daniel - 16

    Tatsumaki - mid twenties (28 in OPM)

    Satori Komeiji - 15

    Rowan Donkerk - early twenties

    Jason Grey - late teen

    Rei - the "most senior student in both senses of the word" so probably over 28

    Counting Red that makes 4 teenage students, and three adult students. (wait I actually don't remember if in this story trainers start their journey at 10 or older, but for some reason it's in my head that Red is 13. Is that right? which chapter was his birthday.)

    We also don't know if Sabrina's students study under her forever, she could have had other students in the past who studied for a few years then went on to do something else. Daniel is the second newest student (behind Red) at one year, so everyone else has been a student for at least a year.
    ```

    - u/DaystarEld:
      ```
      I kept the canon-age of Red starting at 11, so Red is currently 12 :)
      ```

  - u/anenymouse:
    ```
    To me it seemed a lot like either; 1 that the ability to develop psychic abilities peaks at a certain point/it's easier to develop mental powers while the brain is more elastic or 2 that for the most part adults either don't have the time or are just straight up unable/unwilling to spend the amount of time doing the self development stuff. At the same time it makes a lot of sense that someone who was a functional person without needing to heavily develop their psychic abilities might just not be willing to develop a skill that potentially endangers their already functional life. Or at least so that there aren't the fear or paranoia around having someone you thought you knew turn out to be psychic after all the time that you might have known them.

    &#x200B;

    Conversely it might be that there's a limit to how much a teacher might be able to teach a given psychic in the first place and that for the most part her former students might be given some kind of foundation and then left to self-study afterwards. meaning that while there can be older students that just as a matter of timing that most of the people that were being taught at the time that Red is were on the younger side because older people might have already had the opportunity to be taught. But who knows really.
    ```

  - u/turtleswamp:
    ```
    Simplest answer is that, the level of proficiency required to make a comfortable living in the private sector is relatively low so most psychics old enough to be expected to support themsleves would rather just take the job babysitting corporate secrets than continue their studies. It may also be that one or both of the teacher or employer expect a level of loyalty incompatible with doing both (for example you employment contract prohibits letting another psychic into your mind where they might see the secrets you were hired to help protect, but your teacher insists the only way to learn how to resit is to practice).
    ```

  - u/nipplelightpride:
    ```
    Adults are less likely to go to college in the real world too.
    ```

- u/anenymouse:
  ```
  I mean on the one hand there's obviously a lot of differences in terms of the developmental history and the associated slang with it, between our timeline and the hypothetical one happening here, but man it seems like Daniel really means "normie" rather than normal, that and while there hasn't necessarily been that much evidence to suggest that being Psychic has a correlation with a mental disorder I would certainly think there might be if I knew someone that acted like he did. Especially knowing his prodigal status and potential 'genius.' Also while the rest of the chapter certainly does not suggest that it is Red that Sabrina is talking about the mention of partitions and the distancing of the internal thoughts and outer surface layer thoughts, that was definitely my first thought. But is most likely Sabrina being called in as Giovanni's resident Psychic expert.

  &#x200B;

  But jokes aside it's nice to see them working on the ranch, it's also really cool to see the differences in approach from the other student Psychics than Red where we see them i dunno almost like a group of parkour-ers or skaters or some kind of athlete doing the thing and Red's more theory based approach. It's also an interesting way to see prejudice/racism from the group of psychics, especially given that we've previously seen the mentions of the prejudice against Dark trainers. Granted at the same time it makes a lot of sense that even surface level mind readers would be good at turning public opinion against a group that causes them disadvantages. 

  &#x200B;

  I also really enjoyed the talk between Red with/out his partition and that for the most part from the outside he's not unrecognizable and that to large degree it feels like a natural extension of the kind of, not-trouble shooting, or really rubber duckying but like a more personafied devil's advocate type thing. Not quite the whole uhh you know angel and devil on the shoulder but more of an introspective type thing around not being sure about how to deal with emotions. Like it makes sense to me that Red has that kind of grief, like a vein through his entire self from the sudden loss of his father when he was young leaving him kind of vulnerable to another shaking of that kind of situation cause it clearly pings of that deep seated pillar that he's kind of had to build around. Like both Red's have a point the more surface Red has to live in the kind of world where people die all of the time i mean we hear about another smaller even that probably has casualties in this chapter, and Green even says that she was comparatively sheltered to that exposure to death, and that Red lives in a world where everyone pretty much just keeps moving forward and that in a reductive sense that he can't really just go to pieces and not move on from his grief. Conversely suppressed Red has the very valid point that he hasn't really dealt with his grief or even his ongoing conflict with Blue and just keeps shoving them forward and its not like they're just going to solve themselves, for the most part of course i mean in my personal experience of grief i'm certainly not as debilitated as i was the day or even the half a year after but that's after like nine years and it's a different situation that someone who basically keeps re-experiencing that first i dunno day or so after the event.  I mean it's not clear how much time he's spent with the partition down but it doesn't feel like weeks of time cumulatively i mean it doesn't feel like that many days of the partition being down but he does mention that when training that he would sometimes be unable to do anything but lie around afterwards so i guess over the months of training it added up. but even weeks isn't necessarrily that much time when so much of it seems to non-contiguous.

  &#x200B;

  God wrote too much clearly have too much free time, But thank you for writing this story it's something i look forward to at the start of every month.

- u/MaddoScientisto:

  Tatsumaki? Satori Komeji? Really? Don't pretend you are hiding some hot references there.  
  Are the other students references too?  


  This chapter felt the right lenght, halfway through I was dreading it ending too early but instead it kept going into interesting things with the physics, I really enjoyed the whole thing, it didn't feel too short.

  &#x200B;

  Also, for absolutely no reason, I came up with names for the Red personalities, in order of shade:

  past Red: Cinnabar Red  
  present Red: Crimson Red  
  future Red: Scarlet Red
  ```

  - u/FireHawkDelta:
    ```
    This foreshadows how Crimson Red will use his stand,『K I N G _ C R I M S O N』, to erase the other Reds.
    ```

- u/Chosen_Pun:
  ```
  Decided to start re-reading from the beginning after this, and noticed this chapter mirrors the first in a couple places. When Leaf tells Red about her ambitions, they have the exact same exchange in reverse from when Red declared his intent to discover the titular origin of Pokémon species. And of course the very first scene in the entire fic has Past Red taunting Future Red from the alarm clock, in a room that "appears to belong to two very different people". Legendary-tier foreshadowing?

  I have to say it. I think this serial will really suffer without Blue's major involvement.

  Blue drives most of the plot, either through his own personal goals or with the tension he has with Red. I'd hate to see this web serial devolve into feelings chapters and intra-physic politics.

    I don't think Blue will be away for long, honestly. Red is just procrastinating on it, but soon he'll be back.

    Blue just has the most obvious and simple (at least in terms of plot) goals. There's obviously the individual goals of Red and Leaf (slow to get anywhere as they may be), but there's also the bigger plot going on outside of them with Mewtwo.
    ```

    - u/ClaireBear1123:

- u/WalterTFD:
  ```
  Hmm, lots of thoughts here.

  &#x200B;

  First off, I must be confused, like, in what way is Red's partition not already a 'perfect shield', insofar as it would cause mind reading to be wrong?  That is:

  &#x200B;

  Mind Reader: Are you planning on sitting down and crying today?

  Future Red: Nope!  That would be stupid and unproductive.

  Mind Reader: He is telling the truth.

  Future Red: Hmm, I need to relax my partition for a sec for a reason.

  Past Red:  Bwaaah!

  &#x200B;

  I can think of two reasons the partition is imperfect.  The first is that it can be sensed, and the second is that it only changes values, not knowledge of facts.  That is, past & future Red know the same things, and also psychics can detect the partition.  Presumably the 'perfect shield' that Sabrina is worried abut has fixed one or both of these flaws.

  &#x200B;

  The other fascinating question is how Sabrina has a 70% confidence that the perfect shield exists.  It's easy to imagine ways to get a 100% confidence, but 70% implies to me that something has happened that strongly implies a perfect shield, but other explanations exist.  ie:

  &#x200B;

  Psychic: Will you steal the Master Ball?

  Guy: No

  Psychic: Checks out

  Phone: We have your loved ones!

  Guy: Yoink!

  &#x200B;

  If they don't know about the phone above this would look like perfect shield, someone concealed their evil intentions through a screen, and wouldn't have had any detectable partitions.  I expect that these kinds of things are the 30% that she's leaving.

  &#x200B;

  As far as a guess as to what is going on, Mewtwo is the obvious suspect for any psychic phenomenon.  It strikes me as very interesting that they don't think of psychic pokemon as having consciousness of the same kind as people do.  If that's true, and Mewtwo is a chinese room (or simply so foreign that he looks so to human psychics, since we've had chapters from his POV), he may have the 'perfect screen' kind of deal.

  &#x200B;

  I haven't played the original game in a long time, does Mewtwo have any moves that only he has that sound basically like mind control?  If so, that would be my guess, with his puppeteer power playing the part of the phone call above, which makes Sabrina worry about a perfect shield.
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    Just wanted you to know I enjoyed reading this :) As for Mind Control, it's a thing psychics do sometimes in the anime (and Mewtwo explicitly does in his movie), but there's nothing in the game that reflects such an ability.
    ```

    - u/empocariam:
      ```
      This comment made me look for myself if there were any moves I might consider "mind control" in the game. 

      I'm tempted to argue that Imprison and Disable is really weak mind control, but it is negative mind control rather than positive. Making people not do things instead of do them.

      Instruct and Encore are more like mind control, but maybe are just brain short circuits that force you to redo previous thoughts and actions.

      All these (except Imprison) seem to have a common relation in that they all rely on manipulating the targets most recent thoughts/actions. That feels like it might be meaningful... Somehow...

      A lot of fairy moves are kind of mind controlly, or at the very least thought-implanting, but that feels less relevant.
      ```

      - u/DaystarEld:
        ```
        Yeah, I would call all of those memory/thought manipulation more than mind control, which can have similar effects without quite being the same thing. I guess "Charm" effects can also count, in a way. Affecting someone's behavior in a specific way rather than actually controlling it.
        ```

        - u/Chosen_Pun:
          ```
          Taunt also forces a change in behavior, game-mechanically, but I'm sure the intended interpretation is not "mind control" but that it acts on the social stratum, or involves poképheromones at most.

          Then there's Follow Me, and, I assume, some related doubles-specific moves I can't remember the names of right now.
          ```

  - u/Revlar:
    ```
    Red's partition bleedover when he uses his abilities would preclude it from being considered perfect, wouldn't it?
    ```

- u/hankyusa:
  ```
  Yeah, something happened with Mewtwo. It's obvious from Sabrina running off and the details of the task she left them.

  Does anyone think the tier 1 threat that Leaf mentioned might have anything to do with it? It seems a little odd that it was "resolved" so quickly and that Red didn't even know about it. I suspect that something happened that triggered a tear 1 alert, but that somebody got the alert reverted and suppressed reporting on the incident.

  So a question of scale, how do gym leaders have time for anything? There's at least a few million people in Kanto, kids are expected to go on some kind of independent journey, at least some significant fraction are gonna try tackling some gyms (or joining one). Even if most of those gym challengers only challenge one or two gyms in their life, that's still thousands of tests a year the gym leaders need to personally administer.
  ```

    Most challengers get weeded out by the other gym members. First and second badge challenges are the most likely to reach the Leader, and tend to be quick fights.

    Pretty sure the rest of them are parodies on strong psychics from other media, and that's basically all they have so far. 

    So far, from what others have guessed, it seems like they are from:

    Tatsumaki (One Punch Man)

    Rowan Donkerk (Dark Wizard of Donkerk)

    Satori Komeiji (Touhou)

  Wow, so Leaf is really going through with the plan to catch and release every pokemon in existence huh? I mean, it's not *un-*reasonable if you take in to account that automatic catcher that was introduced at the SS Anne. Still, that's a lot logistical problems to consider. Maybe ethical ones too, but when have those ever stopped anyone. 

  I am super excited to see Red finally start talking to himself for some reason! It's like a thing I never knew I needed until I had it. Also, it's good to get small updates from the secondary characters every once in a while like we are. In particular Red's mom, she had some stuff going on and it seems like itll all come to a head soon.

      I might be conflating the mind and the brain…. IRL, it's not a problem since the former is a fiction, so the conflation is easily reversed by treating it as a synonym for the latter; I should be more careful here since minds can be decoupled from the brains that typically host them: do we know for sure that pokéballs cause brain damage? Or are we guessing because the symptoms are similar? If the damage is actually to the mind, the mental shield has a good chance of working.

  Um excuse me author, in chapter 40 Mewtwo and Giovanni are in the *middle* of a Go game:

  >I stay silent and study the Go board, wondering if I should form an eye or start a new formation.

  Yet the section concludes with Mewtwo *starting* the game.

  >"I intend to," I say, and place my first piece on the board.

  The comment about Joy only having one eye now made me wonder whether organ transplantation for Pokemon could've been possible. It took me looking into the idea to realize we don't have the technology to connect something as complicated as the optical nerve yet - kinda obvious in hindsight, since that would mean solving blindness fundamentally. (Partial transplants are possible depending on the part, and research on whole-eye transplant appears to be ongoing.) But at least, in the Pokemon world, containment technology should make most of the storage, preservation and transportation of organs much easier.

  I noticed the references, but only got Tatsumaki and Satori right.

  Also wanted to suggest calling Past Red "Dammed Red", drawing from the comparison Red made last chapter about how his powers work by "damming" certain parts of his neurological activity. And for the wordplay. But I guess "Dammed" Red applies more to Present Red, since he's the version that exists when the partition's up.

  Thanks for the chapter.

  Great chapter. Suspicious for the psychic is either Mewtwo or Red. Tatsumaki and Keiji are from One Punch Man and Mob Psycho 100, (MP100 is extremely recommended.) awaiting confirmation.

  So I've actually been a new reader to this series and I'm not even at this part yet, but I wanted to post this since no one brought it up in the chapter thread (26) I confirmed it.

  In particular, a plot hole during the pewter city arc that disappointed me greatly. Specifically:

  -As part of the negotiations with Ranna, she must be allowed to prepare herself so no one can take advantage of her after being night shaded

  -Blue is, as far as I'm aware, is dark minded and Red decides to have him escort his spinarak for the experiment.

  Considering the whole point of the arc was them not getting exactly what they want on their first tries, I was fully expecting something to come out of this. Otherwise, how did a psychic prepare herself for a dark mind that have superstitions surrounding them about how unpredictable and deceitful they are based solely on how psychics can't probe thier minds at all?
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    Nice catch! I can't remember if I thought this explicitly at the time, but A) the sessions are all being recorded, so that's one layer of protection, and B) Blue is the grandson of professor oak, and fairly young, so he's likely to be deemed on the safe side even if he's Dark.

    Thanks for pointing this out! If you see anything else, please let me know :)
    ```

    - u/Eregorn:
      ```
      I don't think that satisfies the problem.

      A. The camera is a layer of protection that Red controls. Ranna, in the negotiations, is explicitly demanding protections she controls as she presumably doesn't want to rely on Red for her safety. This quote, "The trainer will have to subject themselves to checks I deem necessary", already heavily implies mind probing.

      B. Kanto is established as the most superstitious region and Pewter City a town where religion has enough political power to hinder and meddle with scientific research and advancment. Blue himself is ashamed of his typing and keeps it secret, being revealed is likely to tarnish the oak name instead.

      I personally saw three ways this could of gone

             1. Ranna is just as intolerant as the average kantonian and either

      1a. She suspects foul play and accuses Red and Blue of it. The arc ends in a downer ending as they all stumble on their first obstacle of their ambitions as the angry mob runs them out of town.

      1b. She sees it more as an unfortunate mistake that Red cannot control and simply refuses Blue as is. Red mcgyver's a solution to still get spinarak tested or worst case fails to complete his report.


           2.  It is revealed that psychics are ironically more tolerant of dark typing than the average kantonian and has an alternate means of protection . 

      Blue ends up being the offended party as he is both exposed and possibly humiliated depending what the alternative protection is. Drama occurs but for the most part the story moves on that same path it currently is on.

        >A. The camera is a layer of protection that Red controls. Ranna, in the negotiations, is explicitly demanding protections she controls as she presumably doesn't want to rely on Red for her safety. This quote, "The trainer will have to subject themselves to checks I deem necessary", already heavily implies mind probing.

        It's not, actually, it's a camera that's in her office and streams to her storage. Red collects a copy of it along with the data, but there's nothing stopping her from accessing it if someone acts against her. She could even check it daily and erase her memory of doing so; keep in mind that she's not actually unconscious from any of the attacks, just vulnerable.

        >B. Kanto is established as the most superstitious region and Pewter City a town where religion has enough political power to hinder and meddle with scientific research and advancment. Blue himself is ashamed of his typing and keeps it secret, being revealed is likely to tarnish the oak name instead.

        It would be *incredibly* unprofessional of her to reveal this information, both from the angle of her position and that of the agreement she made with Red. Even if she is superstitious enough to believe that the 11 year old Blue Oak is going to try and attack her just because he turns out to be Dark, the likely worst case scenario would just be to politely refuse. There's no realistic scenario I can imagine where she doesn't come out at least as tarnished as Blue by spreading rumors about him.
