  I really hope Hanno heard something from the Bard's good monologue, so he'll suspect something and spends the time in coma productively (googling about why the hell do all the Bards have the same exact personality and what does it want, at least).
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    I had forgotten he was in coma
    ```

    - u/CeruleanTresses:
      ```
      Wonder if there's some significance to both Knights now being in a coma at the same time.
      ```

  Okay now I Have to go back and re-read ever chapter Hanno shows up in.  We have a protagonists raised in an imperial orphanage raised up by her conquerors and exalted by a man with a will against heaven, and a developing antagonist raised by an imperial refugee orphaned and cast down by thier host city's bad government (presumably before exultation by the God's).  

  Not even to mention Hanno's evident value of the human experience, some of the discussions I imagine there are about his inhumanity (I've only seen him called a p-zombie but the way he repeatedly rewrites his procedural memory . . . )Well yes That, and Cat's current human/other dichotomy I hope her new name will mitigate

  Bravo and well crafted

  Typo thread: 

  > The masks paced on the jutting wood were not set with precious metals and jewels as they were in richer temples.

  Placed.

  > There was an eight pillar in the back he did not walk before, the one whose masks were sculpted straight into the wood.

  Eighth.

  > Neither denied nor embrace, the old saying went.

  Deny, or embraced, but pick a consistent tense unless the old saying is grammatically incorrect.

  > to allow a sliver the light granted to mankind to be offered back to Creation.

  Sliver of the light.
