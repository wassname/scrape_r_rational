  I'll go check out if there are [any good rational horror stories](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2hoef9/any_good_rational_horror_stories/).

  What's the status of eaglejarl's "Pay attention"? I wasn't a huge fan of the Two Year Emperor, but maybe it would be worth checking out?

  I... Haha, that was a really weird and cool read, but what is this? What does it mean to post-pend something with 'Gothic'? Help I am confuse.

    ```
    It's the mid-April tumblr meme. You write something in the style of [Southern Gothic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Gothic) that isn't set in the American South.

    [Gothic fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_fiction). I didn't really know the term before, either. "The English Gothic novel also led to new novel types such as the German Schauerroman and the French roman noir."

  > Politics is the mindkiller. You do not need to come up with thoughts about politics. They would only kill your mind. Rest now.

  > You donate to effective charities to signal virtue to your friends. They are impressed. You feel cold. Friendship isn't about affection. You signal louder and louder to nothing and no one. You have never done anything real. You are not real.

  These had to be my favorites.
