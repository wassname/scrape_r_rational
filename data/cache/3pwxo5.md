## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  The *Limitless* TV show is really disappointing me, even though I thought I was prepared to be disappointed. I'm half-tempted to write some fanfic that fixes all of the issues that could have been addressed in the second episode, but I'm not sure how easy of a salvage operation that would be. They're trying to create an overarching plot, but it doesn't really make sense because of how slow it's all moving.

  I don't *really* think that this is a case of writers trying to write someone that they're stupider than, it's more the limitations of the format that was chosen and the demands of writing to a general audience (and writing for "total satisfaction" rather than "logic", one of the key reasons that works of fiction end up irrational).

    On the other hand/continent, the *One Punch Man* anime is stellar. In case you haven't heard of it, it's about a superhero who has become so powerful he always defeats his opponents in a single blow, and his struggles and boredom with being the strongest man on earth. In episode three some bad guys learn the protagonists are coming to their base, and activate all their trap rooms in their eight-floor tower. The heroes arrive, and the self-appointed sidekick promptly *annihilates* the entire structure from the outside without even trying to enter.

    Anime of the season for sure, not that there's much competition.

      Agreed this season's rather lame but One Punch Man is definitely the best one on it. If you liked that dungeon bypass you may also enjoy Fate/Zero, it has a very similar scene thanks to a 'mage killer' that uses modern tech and dirty tactics to take advantage of mage's lack of common sense and genre savvyness.

    I've been following that show for a while now.

    It's just following the same old crime procedural formula.  I would love if the show tried to break away from that and become more of a political spy thriller.  

    I'm hoping it goes the way of Person of Interest and breaks free of its formula.

      > the same old crime procedural formula

      I hate this. Yet, at the same time, I'm loving GitS: Stand Alone Complex.

      It seems to be more focused on the overarching plot, which I've always wanted to see in shows... The last episode was entirely a VR chatroom discussion about the arc villain, and it managed to be engaging. But at the same time there are still the episodic procedural episodes. I suppose it's due to plot fatigue. Entire shows full of episodic procedural are bad, but episodic episodes interspersing arc episodes are less samey.

      Is it safe to skip the entire first season of Person of Interest? Where does the show start to break free?
      ```

    - u/alexanderwales:
      ```
      So far they've been devoting about five minutes out of every episode to the overarching plot, which I'm hoping increases as the season goes on. They've got all the ingredients for something interesting; there's a smart guy roped into a shadowy conspiracy by an even smarter and more powerful guy who has significant leverage and a whole host of secrets. But they're taking too long to get there and I'm losing patience. More worryingly, they're losing viewers, which is a good way to get cancelled before getting to the interesting stuff.

    I had a bizarre experience in Psychology 101 where, in the unit on psychoactive drugs, my professor brought up NZT as if it were real, and showed a clip from Limitless, describing it as a fictional depiction of the drug.  I looked it up on the internet later, hoping to obtain and exploit it, only to discover that my professor had lied to us all, and NZT was in fact a fictional plot device invented for Limitless.

  The monday and friday thread kind of blur together for me.

  If you were a software dev of middling competence, what would you do to make a relatively passive income? What would you do if you were a highly competent dev?

  I've seen a few interesting "super resolution" algorithms, and I can't help but think that there's a market for them. Sure, they tend to make things look a bit airbrushed, and they won't let you "enhance" a picture of a drivers license, the text would be statistical inference and not accurate.

  But I think there's at least one industry that would pay for that as a service. There are some open source libraries and well known research papers that should be able to get better then bicubic filters.

    I was out with a bunch of friends the other day and I thought to myself, *There's eight people here and every one of us has a smartphone. There's got to be something really cool that I can do with that, but I have no idea what.*

    My first idea was to work out a way to get really, really nice audio by placing people's phones in strategic locations and synchronize them somehow, but I have no real knowledge of audio engineering. I also thought that you should be able to take 3D group photos by having two people -- two phones -- take the shot at once, but there's lots of messy edge cases there too. 

    One thing I would like is to just have an easy, reliable way to link multiple devices together. I shouldn't have to setup a server on my laptop to have my phone talk to it, they both have built-in antennas, the option should just be *there*.
    ```

    - u/ArgentStonecutter:
      ```
      One trick that I've seen on the web is using two phones as a periscope, by streaming the camera of one to the screen of the other, to look over heads in a crowd.

      To just link them together look at [_Serval Mesh_](http://www.servalproject.org/)

      >One thing I would like is to just have an easy, reliable way to link multiple devices together.

      I have some [long rants](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3nkz2y/d_monday_general_rationality_thread/cvp34mz) around here somewhere about this. I think filesystems are the problems, because they're inherently single process. We need a filesystem alternative that syncs across the network and that multiple programs/people can use at once. I think it would solve a lot of problems.

      Talking to /r/rational about it was very helpful in figuring out where I was communicating badly and narrowing down on some implementation details. /u/eaglejarl's stuff about function blocks and /u/trishume's stuff about capnproto.
      ```

      - u/eaglejarl:
        ```
        >  I think filesystems are the problems, because they're inherently single process. 

        What?  There's a miscommunication here somewhere, because file systems are demonstrably not single-process.  Every OS in the world these days is multi-process, and they are all perfectly capable of accessing the filesystem at the same time.

        If you mean that *hard disks* are inherently single process, since the read/write head can only be in one position at a time, sure.  That's nothing to do with the file system, though.


        > We need a filesystem alternative that syncs across the network and that multiple programs/people can use at once. 

        Again, multiple programs/people can already use a filesystem simultaneously.  As to one that syncs across the network, those exist.  cf Dropbox and http://fuse.sourceforge.net/sshfs.html

        Maybe the problem here is one of terms.  When I say "file system", I'm using it in the classic Unix sense.  Everything is a file, files are identified by inodes, there are directories which are really just special files, there's a path structure through the file tree, etc.  What are you using it to mean?

    Honestly, I would probably get an office job where I could work with lots and lots of Excel files. Then I would automate away my job with scripts and not tell anyone that's what I was doing. Then I would just come to work, run my scripts, and surf the internet or write, both of which I would be doing at home anyway. This would necessitate a fairly inefficient company with a lax IT policy. It would also probably require some lies, and I'm not great at lying.
    ```

    - u/traverseda:
      ```
      That income isn't super passive. You still have to be at a place, not working on interesting projects, for most of a day.

      If I'm doing that, I might as well just get a software engineering job that pays more, save up, and occasionally take long breaks. Maybe do the tech nomad thing.
      ```

      - u/alexanderwales:
        ```
        Well, *relatively* passive. I'm sort of assuming that if you can get away with writing scripts to automate away work then you have lax enough management that you can do whatever else you want, which *does* include a large variety of interesting projects. If people expect you to be at your desk in the back office all day anyway, there's no reason that you can't be sitting there coding up whatever your interesting project is (aside from possible legal issues).

        If what you want is to be working in a wood shop, or hiking the Adirondacks, this solution to gaining money without doing much work is less ideal.

  I'm still trying to figure out what "specialty" of Computer Science I should study while an undergrad. ML/AI is the hot thing in this subreddit for obvious reasons, but I'd rather focus on the human side -- it won't matter how smart the adviser is if the king doesn't listen to him. 

  We're finally coming up on truly efficient human structures -- Uber's ride-sharing technology and methodology is the kind of thing that I am very glad to see and what I want to see more of. It's one high-quality app which enables, essentially, a paradigm shift. However, I can also look over at cybersecurity and say **HOLY SHIT THIS IS MISSON CRITICAL AND THERE'S SO MUCH WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE RIGHT NOW.** Which is better? And that's just two rough career paths out of like twenty I have access to. How the hell do I narrow it *at all*? Enrollment for next year is just two weeks away.

  UFAI is way less scary than an entity which is only half as dangerously intelligent but led by humans, and around an infinity times more likely. We're practically there already. I fully expect to live to be a hundred at least, and I want as little unhappiness in all those years as possible.

  The only thing I really, really, truly want out of life is to spend the rest of my life with my SO while not living under some sort of inevitable automated tyranny. What to do in the meantime?

    I love operating system design and software architecture, but it's not really something you can get a job in easily as a highschool dropout with less then a decade of experience.

    I make a lot of money doing web-dev, and it's even relatively painless if I stick to django. It's a very very big market, and you'll never want for employment.

    User Experience is very interesting. It's got to be my second favorite in general. Right now user experience means "how to make things pretty" to a lot of people. But I think good UX shouldn't hide the nuts and bolts. It should present a gradual learning curve that ends with you being a competent programmer yourself.

    Raising the sanity waterline and all that. I think that a big part of avoiding automated tyranny is making computers stop being magic boxes for most people. They need to be able to make informed decisions.

    With VR/AR gaining a lot of support, UX is probably going to be a big thing, since none of our existing (kinda shitty) UI paradigms really work in 3D. Take a look at things like eaglemode as an example of a completely different set of UI paradigms.

    Plus, that general skillset has a nice fallback in webdev and gamedev.

  This week got an amazing idea for a rationalist book that plan to make on Transhumanism but still need to get the time to tackle the challenge. I consider myself below average with words but tend to find trouble getting a plot going without going to extremes (if I'm enjoying the comedy it ends up as a parody, if I'm making it about despair it ends up being a hopeless story) so want to get the planning right before starting it.

  Got all the plots done and know how it will end, currently need to set aside some time to read about how to make a successful book and perhaps practice with some fanfiction.

  Also my plan for a rational Madoka: Rebellion Story doujin is going well, minus the fact I suck at drawing and trying to get it solved. Made my first drawing of the cover but it took lots of time to complete, hope to get better at it and work faster.

  Do you, or have you ever, read (non-pornographic) romance stories (as opposed to adventure stories that happen to contain romance)? Which would you estimate to be your favorites? ([Have you found any to be particularly rational(ist)?](http://np.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/1xu1zn/d_romance_in_rationalist_fiction/))

  *Short answer:*

  When I first discovered fanfiction (a few months before the completion of *[Time Braid](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644)*, in early 2011), most of my reading was NaruHina "fluff"--romance with hardly any plot to it. After reading *Time Braid* and realizing the true awesomeness of fanfiction, I mostly switched to adventure, and looked for romance stories only when I couldn't find any good adventure stories, particularly in less-popular fandoms. *[Little Moments](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8440324)* (*Ben 10*: Ben/Gwen--better than it sounds) is definitely my favorite romance-focused story, and [Chapter Eight of *Background Pony*](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/19198/8) (*Friendship Is Magic*: Lyra/OMC--*absolutely heart-wrenching*) is probably my second-favorite. Some others that I've liked:

  * *[Study of the Heart](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3910130)* (*Naruto*: Sai/Sakura)

  * The *Stalking Zuko* trilogy ([1](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7250783) [2](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7325839) [3](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8121138)) (*Avatar*: Katara/Zuko--bad English is excusable because it's the diary of Katara the filthy peasant)

  * *[Then Tomorrow Came](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/19567)* (*Friendship Is Magic*: Twilight/Rainbow)

  * *[And They Call It Puppy Love](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/180647)* (*Friendship Is Magic*: OFC/OMC)

  * *[The Great Gatsby](http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/f/fitzgerald/f_scott/gatsby/index.html)* (original)

  None are particularly rational, though, in my very limited estimation.

  - u/Timewinders:
    ```
    I've found that I actually enjoy romance, I just hate the stupid, petty drama that comes with it in most original fiction. Most of the romance I read is the fluffy fanfic kind since I know going in that I'll like the characters/pairing and that there's a good chance that there isn't going to be too much drama.

    If you like Zuko/Katara then [Enslaved](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5306755/1/Enslaved) is a decent one. It avoids the usual cliches because Zuko's the one taken prisoner by Katara. It's incomplete but it ends at a point that feels like a pretty satisfying ending.

    [Humanoids](http://archiveofourown.org/works/2431040) is a Mass Effect femShep/Liara pairing that also has some very interesting worldbuilding to it. It follows the premise of "what if humanity had developed sentient AI, and then something happened so all the organics died out before humanity discovered the mass relays". All of the human characters, including Shepard, are replaced by androids. It does have smut though in case that bothers you. 

    I also like some romance anime. As far as that goes, Nana is easily the most realistic romance story I've seen in fiction, though it does have quite a bit of drama. Though unfortunately the source material is on hiatus so the anime will probably never see a proper ending. The main character is far from rational though and makes many mistakes, though to be fair they're the kinds of mistakes many people in real life make. 

    For fluffy romcom, I'd recommend Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun. The focus is more on the comedy than the romance and the romance doesn't go anywhere quickly at all, but it's pretty funny, especially if you're familiar with the tropes of shoujo manga and anime. 

    Ouran High School Host Club is a pretty hilarious romcom. It's one of the most consistently recommended romcoms on /r/anime so I think it has pretty broad appeal even to men. 

    Eureka Seven is a mecha anime that also has a pretty nice romance as a major subplot/main plot. The main character's kind of annoying at first, but he gets better about a fifth of the way into the show. I liked both the primary couple and the side couple of Dominic/Anemone. Whatever you do, though, don't watch the sequel anime (Eureka Seven Ao).

    Nope. Or at least, not usually. I like reading about Interesting People, and one of my primary criteria for determining what qualifies as interesting is that they have interesting conflicts, and Romance rarely qualifies if it's the only thing the charachters are really conflicted about. That's not to say I haven't ever read romance stories, or adventure stories that get so fluffy they're borderline, but i never go explicate looking for the stuff.

      Ditto. I think my favorite romance sub-plot in a novel is probably Serene/Raoden in Elantris, and they don't even see each other for most of the book. And when they do, it's still not in any romantic capacity until later because off…well, the plot being more important.

  I very suddenly went from no romantic involvement with anyone to a slightly awkward situation.

  A few months ago, I met an Italian guy online. Since then, we've played games and chatted/skyped several times a week. We're both bi, which will become relevant in a bit.

  This week was my first week of university classes (compsci, though that's not really relevant). During lunch on Wednesday, a Chinese girl sat with me and we spent the rest of the lunch break and the next class together with a friend of hers. We didn't see each other on Thursday because our schedules didn't overlap, but we spent most of Friday together as well. The whole time, I had a vague impression that she had a crush on me. 

  We started texting that evening, and she told me she liked me. I responded, saying it's mutual (which is true). Meanwhile, I was chatting with my Italian friend and relating my conversation with her to him.

  After that ended (she went to bed), he told me he had something to tell me and confessed to liking me, which he felt weird about because we have never met and he didn't even know what I looked like. We started a video call shortly thereafter, and the first thing he said was "Oh my god you're cute" (wording may have been different). That's when I realized the feeling was mutual.

  In light of [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2vkeqf/q_rational_polyamory_fanfics/) not-so-recent discussion, I brought up the idea of *not* choosing one or the other of them. He was rather receptive to the idea, but I haven't gotten a chance to talk to the girl in person and won't until Monday.

  Do you have any advice that you feel I should know?
  ```

  - u/Transfuturist:
    ```
    1. Be very careful about broaching the topic with her.

    2. Long-distance relationships are a risky prospect in general, with its own stressors, and adding polyamory may compound those stressors with its own.

    This situation does not seem very viable to me. It could work for you, but if I were in this situation... I would probably panic.

    Complex explanations of how magic and psionics between those two worlds interact and if there's a link between the big players in Worm and the magicians in HPMOR.

    If you're going to include Harry, Hermione, Draco, etc., I would prefer that they were aged up. Eleven and twelve are not the sorts of ages that most people can write well, and it detracts from more serious and complex plots, as well as cutting off most of the romance angles (because you can write a romance between twelve year olds, but it's going to lack gravity *in addition to* squicking a fair number of people out).

    I'm having trouble figuring out where there are compelling points of interface between the settings. I suppose the Harry Potter series shares the theme of bullying with Worm (with some parallels between Snape and Taylor), but not much of that carries over to HPMOR. The magic systems aren't really compatible; wizards are mostly fungible while parahumans are singleton. They both have elements of raging against the system and munchkinism under constraints, but I don't know what you really add by adding them together.
    ```

    Lots of experimentation.

    Every Worm character spends ages working out tricks they can do with their power, and every power has hidden depths that can crack it wide open.

    On the other hand, every HPMOR character has an almost limitless supply of specific, physics-breaking Things they can do with a little training, and (in canon HPMOR) the characters have to make do with "low-level" spells and think of clever alternative applications based on the details of their effects.
