  The story begins [here](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/300693/1/shears/bridges-1).

  Basic info is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3te0fy/rtff_shears_chapter_1_rmlp/cx5d65r).

  Thanks for reading! Let me know what you think about the characterization in this chapter, if you like.

  Okay, I have to say this, because every fic does this and at some point I'm just gonna explode.

  Equestria isn't a kingdom, it's a principality. A kingdom is ruled by a king or queen, a principality is ruled by a prince or princess. Princess does *not* mean "daughter of a king/queen", it means ruler, from *princeps,* which means (more or less, and I know someone's going to swoop in with a slightly more correct definition) "in charge." Popular culture has forgotten, but there were a lot of sovereign rulers whose title was prince or princess.

  As far as I know you haven't done this yet, but while I'm on princessly terminology peeves, generally a prince or princess is referred to as "highness," not "majesty."

  EDIT: Equestria isn't *necessarily* a principality. It could be whatever the hell Verona was, or a city state, or whatever, but the generic term would be principality.

    You're forgetting the first rule of absolute monarchy: When the immortal god-emperor says she's the pharaoh of this duchy, you don't get to argue.

    You're applying terms of Earthling lineal traditions to a sovereign state of technicolor aliens with an immortal ruler. Stop doing that.
