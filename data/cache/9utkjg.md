  What an interesting verb choice.

  Reading this in TeamFourStar's voices is a treat :)

  I always wondered if the Saiya-jin peculiar biological trait of "healing back stronger after injury" could apply to the brain's cognitive functions ? The lack of intellectual challenges and social rivalry to Goku for pretty much all of his life (except in the very narrow field of fighting strategy) would then explain his utter candor and total unpreparedness in the face of any form of lying or treachery, which is itself so common in his own kin by contrast.

  And it would allow for Gohan to grow into a limitless genius...

  Unrelatedly, the biggest problem with DBZ is that it does the "power creep" aspect of titan fights poorly. As far as I know, the only anime that treats power creep correctly, where opponents are fighting using over-the-top powers that are ripe for munchkinry, is JoJo's Bizarre Adventure.

    Just saying, this concept is exactly what I used as a start for The Optimised Wish Project :). Goku hits his head as a child and suffers brain damage, and thus wakes up with an intelligence boost as soon as his wound regenerates. But I'd still put a limit on something like this or it'd be ridiculously exploitable. After all, even if you consider it a sort of 'tuning' of efficiency, there's only so much you can do to make a human-ish brain better within the constraints of space, energy consumption etc. for it. The same happens with the physical zenkai power boost: it caps at a point, which is why it stopped being so relevant after Namek.

  Definitely enjoyed this. Hope it is continued at some point.
