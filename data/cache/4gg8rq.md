  A story about one possible outcome to emotion regulation and transhumanism.

      Yeah. Bakker is great at hitting you from both sides. The Rigged are really creepy, but there is something suboptimal, animalistic and pathetic about Glenn   

      You can easily see why his  kind is going extinct. 

      There's no easy answer. The status quo isn't inherently better or more pure,we're just used to it.

        Oh, my sense of visceral horror isn't unthinking it's that a marketing analyst smart enough to presumably understand the concepts of and massage the data of a neural network, and thus falling into the mental bin of potential in-tribe members, is believable depicted as a wire-header.

        If your argument about status quo extends to wire-heading, I'd direct you to the Prime intelligence series.

  Damn that was intense. Even with those risks, damn. I'd gladly take the implant. The ability to dial back emotions would be godlike.

    Right. And that's how it starts. Because, the main argument to not have a little tweak sounds like Ludditism and fear mongering.  

    And then off to the races we are!
