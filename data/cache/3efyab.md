## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  Started playing Terraria again since the 1.3 Update, and I never noticed before how the game subtly encourages the transiston from a scorched-earth extraction policy to careful conservation. Acorns and seeds are plentiful, and but wood and herbs are scare enough (compared to how much you need) that you are incentivized to replant forests after cutting them down and to cultivate gardens of dayblooms, glowing mushrooms, etc. in their respective biomes.

  I also like the truly fantastical nature of the game, which has absolutely no compunctions about giving Magic Missile and a handgun as loot from the same area, and how there's just enough lore to seed a nice fanfic but no real story whatsoever. 

  I want to say it's an excellent little game, except for the fact that it isn't little at all. I'm currently working on a grand castle with an underground apartment and biome complex, and probably won't be finished till after summer is over.

    Hey I'm playing Terraria again too! Maybe we should set up a server...

    Anyway it's much easier to just level a bunch of worlds for wood than to replant. Hey don't look at me like that! those worlds were doomed to be consumed by the corruption anyway. Deforestation is the least of their problems.

      Oh definitely. There's something incredibly satisfying about running across the landscape while thowing sticky bombs and dynamite at the bases of all the trees, and watching them explode one by one by one.

  I've noticed that it's been a long time since a book or movie has elicited any strong emotional response from me (I do enjoy them greatly, but don't cry or laugh as before) . Is it normal to stop empathizing as you grow older or do I need to find better books? When was the last time a work of fiction really *moved* you?
  ```

  - u/alexanderwales:

    Find better books. Try to read them more deeply as well; it might be that you're just going through the motions of reading without making an attempt at investment. (Edit: I will say that I had some temporary setbacks in this regard; once you've read enough fiction, you can eventually get to the point where you say, "Oh, powerful mentor figure, he's either going to turn bad or die at the end of the first act." If that's your problem, the solution is mostly to stop caring.)

    The last work of fiction that really moved me was *Inside Out*, which I saw about two weeks ago, but there are a few works that have personal resonance that I can continually get an emotional response from. (For reference, I'm nearly thirty.)

      As far as that goes, video games aren't terrible either. It is, in some ways, easier to find yourself invested into them. 

      The Mother series in particular is poignant for me; just hearing some of their songs is enough to make me cry, much less in association with the recently deceased Satoru Iwata. But even that aside, Mother 3 is an utterly heartbreaking game.

    Hmm, I've definitely experienced less empathy for characters as time goes on. But I have found a method of sort of meditating myself into an equivalent state of sorrow. It mostly just requires slow breathing, and focusing on your core and the feeling of the negative emotion until it expands.

    It doesn't quite get to the level I've experienced when people I know have died, but I haven't really practiced it that much because I prefer psyching myself into joy than sorrow.

    Sorrow is my second favorite emotion though. I wonder if that's unhealthy...

    Edit: Come to think of it, the fact that I tend to psyche myself into joy regardless of circumstance might be the reason I have less empathy. Hard to feel the suffering of others as much when your own lever is glued to happy. Maybe I should practice sorrow more after all.
    ```

    I've actually had the opposite experience. When I was first reading very few of the characters mattered to me, and I didn't really care about events that weren't related to the plot. Now, if I care about a character and, say, their wife dies, I at least understand why that is a big deal.

    The last time I watched K-19 I wept. I recommend it as a test.

    The only stories I can remember to have brought tears to my eyes are *[Death Note](http://www.hulu.com/death-note)* ([spoiler](#s "Light dies without completing his crusade")) and *[Atlas Shrugged](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/662)* ([spoiler](#s "Minnesota grain trains are stolen for no good reason by politicians, letting the grain rot and the people starve")). (There was also *Inspector Gadget 2* ([spoiler](#s "The Inspector loses his badge after botching a stakeout")), but that's long enough ago that it probably doesn't count.)

    I'm pretty sure several fanfiction stories have made me *literally* gasp in utter amazement at their sheer awesomeness since then, on my first readings of them--*[Time Braid](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644)* and *[Methods of Rationality](http://hpmor.com/)* are the obvious candidates, but *[People Lie](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3745099)*, *[Little Moments](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8440324)*, and even *[Chunin Exam Day](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3929411)* and *[Partially Kissed Hero](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4240771)* may have done it as well.

      Wait.  The moments in fiction that bring tears to your eyes are about Yagami Hikari's goals, and a thing from Ayn Rand?

        Really, I'm less sympathetic to the *ideas* than I am inspired by the *people.* Sure, if you think about it, it's rather ridiculous that Light could control six or seven billion people with *at most* half a dozen artifacts spread among his most devoted followers--but I'm still moved to tears every time I see the incredible conviction and devotion to righteousness (defined however suspectly) that Light displays in the first episode of *Death Note*, and the final episode brought similar feelings to my mind. Likewise, it's not the objectivist ideas themselves that allows *Atlas Shrugged* to move me--rather, I get teary-eyed at the incredible descriptions of how the corrupt politicians and businessmen slowly destroy the USA from the inside over the course of the book, plus some extra stabs of pity for the eternal tribulations of Dagny's brother.

        On the alignment test [here](http://easydamus.com/alignmenttest.html), I'm evenly split between lawful neutral and lawful evil ([image](http://i.imgur.com/htQnbLU.jpg))--as of two months ago, at least.

        (The given name of *Death Note*'s protagonist is literally "Light" (or "Raito", depending on the translator or fanfiction writer), not "Hikari"--though the kanji is some kind of weirdness...)

        (Oh, I forgot to mention that the ending of *Angel Beats!* also made me tear up a little.)

          But doesn't his actual goal *matter*?  Would all that valor be so glorious if it served the goal of maximizing paper-clips?

          >rather, I get teary-eyed at the incredible descriptions of how the corrupt politicians and businessmen slowly destroy the USA from the inside over the course of the book, plus some extra stabs of pity for the eternal tribulations of Dagny's brother.

          But that's so... unrealistic.  Implausible.

  Anyone else super excited for VR? I can't wait till the Vive is commercially available.
  ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    VR (like a lot of platforms) is going to live and die by the apps that run on it. Right now, the use case seems to mostly be novelty and immersion, roughly in that order. I have two friends who have the Oculus Rift, and I've played it quite a bit, but ... what's the killer app for VR? An exercise program combined with a videogame?

    Without a killer app, early adopters are the only ones that buy in, which means that development resources aren't put towards building with the platform in mind, which means that new apps aren't made, which in turn slows adoption. I've seen this happen quite a bit with other platforms, and it's part of why I'm of a "content first" mindset.

    This is part of why I think AR is the one that's going to change things. I can imagine lots of virtual things that you'd want to tack onto the real world.

    I'm so excited for the Vive and the Oculus.  2016 is going to be the year that VR takes off.

    I'm even more excited for AR though.  I think it will be a big revolution, as big as the TV.  Hopefully Magic Leap doesn't end up being vaporware.

  - u/alexanderwales:

    I did. I keep meaning to set this up to be posted by AutoModerator, but it seems like a poorly documented and poorly maintained feature. And that means that whenever I think about doing it, it seems like the sort of thing that I should just put off until later. (As with most automation tasks, it's better in terms of time saved to do it early in order to get the most payoff, and I know that ... but it feels like less work to just manually post it.)

    Edit: Alright, created a schedule and added the Off-Topic Thread to it, hopefully that works next week.

  If you could chose to research absolutely anything and get unlimited funding for precisely one research, what would you research?

  P.S. Does anyone know how common it is for someone applying to grad school to have had research papers published?

  EDIT: You have a lot of money to burn, so you can use it to pay other people to help/do-it-for-you with your research. However you're still required to be the leader and to direct the progress of the project. Thanks /u/alexanderwales for pointing that possibility out.

    /r/replicatingrobots

    Self replicating robotic machinery in space.

    Reason:

    1. The energy and materials available in space are abundant, so replication rates of greater than once per year are almost certainly feasible. The abundant vacuum lets us use vacuum deposition of ions in place of current electrolytic methods, and the negligible gravity reduces the material costs for supporting structures, while permitting fine structures to be formed with less distortion.

    2. Exponential doubling at an annual rate or better is fast enough to reach megascale engineering levels within a matter of decades. Megascale engineering allows for the creation of trillions of parallel robotic laboratories for running experiments which can improve efficiencies and resolve nagging human problems like aging.
    ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    Do I have to research it myself, or can I just throw money at the problem? Will I have people working with me?

    I guess if I don't personally have to do it, I would say self-sustaining systems, though I don't know if that violates "precisely one". In other words, I want to research how to attain small-scale homeostasis for an environment, preferably one that has humans in it. This would be useful in space, but also useful in creating sustainable cities, as well as creating pockets of civilization which can exist independently of each other (ensuring long-term species survival).

    If I have to do it all by my lonesome ... natural-language processing, I guess. Automated text generation is going to be one of the big new fields; you already see some of it for simple business news articles and sports reports. Some day (probably sooner than we think) it's going to be possible to have a computer write a book that people would actually want to read, and not just for the novelty of it.

  What's everyone's take on global finance/economy at the moment? It seems like the world is a powderkeg of debt ready to default, and we're just waiting for the spark of default to set it off.

    I'm mostly just not worrying about it, given my lack of domain knowledge on the subject. I have investments through a fairly conservative 401K run through my company, but that's about it. Finances are one of those things where I worry about the Dunning–Kruger effect quite a bit. The market preys on unwise investors.

    If the global economy *does* melt down, I have marketable skills and live a fairly spartan lifestyle, meaning that I can probably weather whatever comes better than most other people, short of civilizational collapse (which is a whole different topic).

  I've been pondering how to approximate a mesh for collision detection by packing it full of ellipsoids.  I had a uniform sphere packing algorithm working decently, which placed spheres at grid points that were inside the mesh and then ran a few iterations colliding them with each other and the mesh boundaries to get a tight packing.  However for thin objects you have to use way too many tiny spheres, and allowing variably oriented and sized ellipsoids could vastly reduce the particle count.  I'm really not sure how to structure that optimization problem though.
  ```

  - u/traverseda:
    ```
    I suspect that sphere packing isn't the right approach for that problem.

    But perhaps you could have a stage where your spheres grow? Throw some spheres in, grow them until they're filling the space. Obviously your grow them on each axis independently.

    Then pack in more spheres. Repeat. You probably actually want to be using capsuleShape if you're using bullet.

    I'd be inclined towards trying to segment the mesh into convex-hull-able shapes, generally.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      I'm actually using my own real time physics engine (based on positional dynamics, I can go into more details if anyone is curious).  

      Inflating ellipsoids is an interesting iterative approach, but the trick would be adjusting the orientations.  Ideally as it inflated each ellipsoid would rotate to fit the space.  That might just mean implementing full rigid collision resolution during the packing process so that resolving against the faces can apply a torque.

      The other tricky thing is choosing good seed locations... it's probably best if these ellipsoids grow at the same time and collide with each other as they grow so you end up with a roughly uniform packing.  Consider the following test case: a board that is 2m x 0.5m x 0.1m.  I would consider an ideal packing to have an 8x2 rectangular packing of mentos shapes all slightly overlapping each other, but if I grow one ellipsoid at a time I will likely end up with a big one occupying the whole board and then a couple tiny ones in the corners.
      ```

  - u/Charlie___:
    ```
    Bearing in mind that I know nothing about the subject...

     How about inflating shapes? Start with a sphere of some minimum size in a random valid location. When your shape isn't in contact with anything, increase its radius. When it's in contact with things only on one half of the sphere (in practice, things that are almost opposite may be a problem, so one-third or one-quarter might be better), inflate it by moving it away from the contacts as you increase the radius (the farther apart the contact points are, the more you have to move). When you can't grow as a sphere any more, find the average plane that the points of contact lie in and try to grow as an ellipsoid with long axis normal to that plane.

    There are some interesting problems with this approach, but I bet someone else has worked out a good implementation.
    ```
