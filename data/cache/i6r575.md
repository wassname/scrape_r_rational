    I'm in my 30's and I can't remember the last time I knocked on a door. I always just text friends that I'm almost there.

  Looks like the stakes just went up significantly. >!Turry has recruited an army of at least thirty thousand volunteers over the internet. That pretty much proves that he is constantly talking to and manipulating far, faaar more people than we see and acquiring assets. !<

    It seems like Turry is setting up the unassuming Emma as a go-between for gramps and Samwise.
