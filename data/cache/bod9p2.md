  Thank you everyone for reading along so far! I'm blown away by all the attention and feedback this story is getting. As a little extra thank you (and because I'm getting too far ahead in the reserve chapters), here is an extra chapter for your Tuesday update!

  Also, here are Haley's monster stats for Chapters 1-6. Obviously it would have helped if I'd had these out for CH 1, buuuut better late than never: https://urlzs.com/cKgh5

  Final Also, this story now has a royalroad page, if you prefer to read it on there.

    Rescued this comment from Automoderator, who ate it because there's a URL shortener.

      Oh, thank you! I wondered what had happened.

  This just gets better and better. The Jabberwocky's cognitohazardous sister is very scary, that was a legitimately unsettling read.

    Question. The girl in the asylum, she's a Keter-grade Alice? Or evil FiM EqG Screwball, she creates monsters, or just lets them out of her own imagination?

    Why is there a Stranger effect on the rabbit?

      One of many questions I do not have answers to. I can't even decide whose side the animals are on, or whether I think Not-Alice is a schizophrenic whose delusions are loose upon the world or a receptor/vector for some truly bizarre shit that has always been around just at the edges of our vision.

        To me it seemed like they were separate as there were a few times she didn't seem to understand their references
        ```

- u/Escapement:
  ```
  Neat story so far. I like the latest twist a fair bit. 

  The next named category of d20PF Gold Dragon ("Very Young") comes with Change Shape, so presumably Haley will be able to turn into 'any animal or humanoid' 3x per day (indefinite duration each time). Being able to spend time as, well, her former self, should do wonders for the whole metamorphosis body horror thing and associated problems. Even if she spends a lot of time as a dragon, just *having the ability* to do otherwise would reassure the heck out of me in the same situation.

  Also, are you going for US or British spelling? I noticed "laborer beasts" followed shortly afterward by "labourer" several times and then "center".

    ```
    Spelling should almost always be US unless I'm specifically trying to evoke an accent. Thank you again for checking, will get these edited in a bit :)
