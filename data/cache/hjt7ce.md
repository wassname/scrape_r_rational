## Is "Forty Millenniums of Cultivation" a manga or text?

### Post:

I find both a text version and a manga online. So what is it?

  The manhua is a bit of a mess, especially the official translation. The novel has its issues too, but is definitely the definitive edition. The novel is the original and much further along.

  Why does it have to be only one or the other? It is a CN, likely with a manhwa adaption.

    What does CN stand for?

      ```
      Chinese Novel. As opposed to KNs (Korean) and LNs (Japanese Light Novels)
      ```

  It's primarily a chinese webnovel, being translated into English on a daily basis.  The manga adaptation is a long way away from approaching where the webnovel translation is currently at.

  Instead of reading on webnovel.com, if that's where you found it, I recommend sites like [WuxiaWorld](https://www.wuxiaworld.co/Forty-Millenniums-of-Cultivation/) or [NovelFull](https://novelfull.com/forty-millenniums-of-cultivation.html).  From everything I've heard, webnovel's administration is pretty scummy, so I have no compunctions with reading on an alternative site.

  It's text

  ```
  You can read **Forty Millenniums of Cultivation** text version at [NovelFever](https://novelfever.com/book/forty-millenniums-of-cultivation) (at the moment is chapter 2156),
  ```
