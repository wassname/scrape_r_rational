## [META] Not 'fiction' per se, but would a deconstructionist, potentially transhumanist Star Wars online tabletop campaign be of interest here?

### Post:

The campaign in question: http://www.reddit.com/r/lfg/comments/260r4i/online_star_wars_saga_edition_running_a/

While whether or not any roleplaying game is 'rational' depends heavily on the ongoing actions of those playing it, I would be very glad to have players who know the value of actually doing whatever is needed to succeed (as opposed to just whatever effort is expected of their subconscious model of their role), and it seemed like something that might relevant to the interests of this subreddit.

  ```
  I saw this there and didn't say anything for a few reasons foremost of which is that you don't mention medium up front ((how we will be playing)) and the other reason is that I don't normally reply as either these don't happen because the person gets bored or no one wants to play but if you are dedicated enough to branch out to other communities i would be excited to play if it is play by post or similar method that does not require me to be somewhere specific at a specific time.
