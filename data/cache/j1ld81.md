## Heart of Cultivation book one now available

### Post:

When I posted about Heart of Cultivation before there were a few of you who indicated that you'd be interested once more content was available. I'm happy to say that the story has progressed to the point that the first book of the series is complete. It's [available on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Heart-Cultivation-Heartbreak-book-xianxia-ebook/dp/B08K2K5XHR/) for purchase or for borrowing under KU.

The ongoing story continues to be posted on Royal Road and will be freely available until it's time for book two to go up on KU.

Story blurb is as follows:

***Jian gave up on immortality long ago. Backed into a corner, can he defy fate and surpass his old limits?***

*Jian was a prodigy, at least until he discovered that his path of cultivation had hit a dead end almost as soon as it began. That was all years ago, though. He has long since resigned himself to his fate and prepared himself for a dull, ordinary, but happy life. Stunted cultivation or no, he's clever enough to carve out his own comfortable niche.*

*Unfortunately, his fiancÃ©e has other ideas.*

*When his past entanglements come back to create new problems, Jian will have to step up and deal with them... or at least figure out how to wriggle free of the consequences.*

  So I've been reading this from the start on Royal Road, and my short answer is that this is a solidly written, good book and I pretty much recommend it. It got called "slow" at times on Royal Road, but that's the same thing as Delve (which also gets posted here) where its a book from a currently popular genre, released on a set schedule, that has more than three chapters in a row that aren't a flashy action sequence, numbers-go-up moment, or M. Night Shyamalan-esque twist.

  &#x200B;

  All that said though, my detailed and long answer is more complex. I've read and enjoyed a lot of works over the years. Some of the works I've enjoyed a lot are things like Worm, Homestuck, Chilli and the Chocolate Factory, Wuthering Heights, and Nozomanu Fushi No Boukensha (mostly the first book in that series). None of these works are perfect, they all have flaws to them, but they have some aspect of passion/intensity/insanity/depth/detail/etc that resonated really hard with me and carried the work. Sort of like finding a diamond in a pile of shit, you can just focus on the diamond and leave the shit behind. Now the ratio of diamond to shit in the works I listed (and I lot of things I've read in general) is much more diamond than shit, hence why I saw fit to list them in a comment about recommendations that are good, but the main reason I bring them up is to contrast with Heart of Cultivation. There is no diamond, nor any shit, in Heart of Cultivation. To keep the valuable item metaphor going, Heart of Cultivation is more like gold. It is solid and most folks are happy to have it, but if you spend all your time looking for and enjoying diamonds, its not something you're going to care about. Overall, Heart of Cultivation is just what I said in my first sentence of this comment, both solid and good, but some people are only looking for works that are absolutely unique because either that's what they value, that's what they're looking for, or that's what they can fit into their schedule. I doubt anyone who reads it is going to schedule a reread of it every year or get a tattoo of it or try recommending it to "that one friend of yours who doesn't read fiction but they really should give this one book a try please just come on it is amazing."

  &#x200B;

  Oh and one more thing, it's a good Xianxia work, so if you've been curious about the genre but haven't found a work that wasn't lacking in quality, translation, or quality translation, then give this a shot.

    I somewhat agree, though I'm considerably more negative considering how much I enjoyed his two previous fanfics.

    The main problem for me is that there is no overt sense of conflict or danger about his quest at all, and the stakes are all self-imposed. Jian's pushed into his actions by a feeling of... offended pride? Not love, ambition, vengeance, or any of that good stuff, but because his arranged marriage fiancee was *publicly rude* to him.  That's it? If she'd dumped him in private the story wouldn't happen?

    He hasn't talked to his fiancee in a decade! He's not mistreated by his parents or his clan, they do not put any strong pressure on him to push himself at all, and he repeatedly thinks about resolving the main driver of the story by **talking it out** with his father-in-law, who is a decent man with positive feelings towards him and his family. Even with the sect, which would make good antagonists, we are repeatedly told they wouldn't try anything overt with him for fear of damaging their reputation! Its so very odd how the author continually deflates any sense of urgency or pathos. 

    The conflicts then become... what, exactly? His family stopping his experimental self-treatment for his own good? The wild animals killing him while he's foraging in the wild? Dying due to botched experimental surgery? Even when the >!sect guy attacks him, what is the guy's motivation? NOT WAITING 2 YEARS!?!? Arent these guys extremely long lived?!< Basically it comes out of left field and has zero emotional resonance. And that's the climax to a book? 

    At end of the day, because Jian isn't fighting for anything he truly wants, the only risk to his life are those who imposes on himself, because at any moment this guy can swallow his pride and go home. Not a good foundation for a story, imo.

      I think part of it is the story imports a lot of cultivation novel background/tropes without actually doing enough worldbuilding to really justify it. IE, it's just kinda never stated that as the heir to a sizeable clan without the ability to advance in cultivation he's probably looking at an assassination 10 or 15 years down the line if he doesn't do anything to change his situation. He's both a liability to his family, kinda an embarrassment, and a dangerously tempting target for an ambitious uncle or nephew. And we never really get the characterization for why Tingfeng is willing to just murder a guy whose existence is a mild inconvenience for him, but if you've read enough Xianxia stories your mind basically goes, oh, yeah, core disciple of some bigwig sect, massive entitlement and casual disregard for the lives of others pretty much comes part and parcel with that. The conflicts could work, but the social dynamics driving them aren't sufficiently fleshed out. There's a good story here, but it needs a heavy editing pass to really shine.

        I can believe it, I know him to be a very talented writer. Writing on a tight schedule is its own skill, though.

          Yeah, I enjoyed his Tanya fic a lot too, dude can do work when given a really interesting idea/world to draw from. His other current project, a LitRPG, is kinda similar in quality to Heart of Cultivation in that its taking a genre's generic premise and just doing a solid rendition of it. Although it's pretty true to the genre, it's a bit too heavy on the "numbers go up" for me to want to do more than read a backlog of it every few months right now (although that's part and parcel to being a generic LitRPG project).

          To be fair, if he got handed permission to write an official Magic: The Gathering work, that'd have enough of an established and interesting universe that he'd blow people away with his work (both by being good, and by being better than what gets officially printed by miles).

          (Actually I realised something, if the dude wants to write, but is much better at writing good words than writing good ideas, so to speak, going for two popular genres filled with an audience that tolerates terrible and uninspired work regularly is a good business idea. Big fish in a small pond type of deal, as well as establishing fans and making money off practicing to become a better writer)

        MC is not heir to anything, his father is one of the sons of the patriarch presumably his parents have more children. He's not a target for assassination, he's his worlds equivalent of a crippled relative, his family will take care of him but that's about the extent of it.

        &#x200B;

        Also it's a cultivation world, presumably his grandfather has the appearance and health of a 40yo, is still sexually active and has younger children than his grandson, maybe even great grandsons older than the MC.

        If an assassination is in the cards, there is not much indication given by Jian that such a thing will happen. He's also a son of a second or third son of the patriarch, pretty well enough down a typical feudal line of succession. The thing is your typical line of succession is made irrelevant if someone has greater cultivation. The whole clan isn't going to just hand responsibility to some guy like Jian if there's more powerful people around, no matter who his father may be.  He also has more powerful cousins who would be given a leadership role regardless of whose son he is, they don't even need to murder the guy. You're right about how motivations could be more fleshed out though.

  I've never understood how/why authors that start a serial for free think that it's a good idea to stunt the growth of the audience and put some of it behind a paywall. Doesn't this just result in natural attrition and over time a failure in support?

  I would also add that I am an enfranchised member of the serial community, I have several authors that I support on patreon.

  Is this related to 40 millenniums of cultivation somehow. That book is next on my read list but its description is pretty weird.

  Is there some specific meaning to "cultivation" that everyone knows or something?

    It's chinese fantasy, but every character is a mage and there are levels but the power difference between levels is higher. And levels don't use numbers but names, like emperor, spirit, heaven or something like it.

    &#x200B;

    It's different, interesting and fun. And it scratches the progression fantasy itch like nothing else.

    It's a specific fantasy genre popularized in China that is loosely based off the older wuxia genre. It largely reached the west via fan translations, and has been slowly growing here, especially with web serials. (Though some, like the *Cradle* series, were released in novel format)

    The exact nature comes down to a bunch of established tropes that are present in some combination, but essentially the core of it is magical martial arts with significant power scaling in the setting. Generally, this is at least partially quantatized, with distinct levels of power that have some sort of qualitative difference between them^1. Beyond this, there are a whole bunch of common setting elements that mirror Chinese martial arts tropes, such as schools/sects dedicated to specific styles or families, mystical and powerful martial arts techniques, gaining strength through careful meditation techniques, etc.




    ^(1. in this specific story, the central plot revolves around a birth defect in the main character that makes it impossible for him to go from the first level to the second, despite being very talented compared to most at that first level)
