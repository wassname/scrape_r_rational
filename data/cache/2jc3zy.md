## [RT] "Pay Attention" Kickstarter announces second stretch goal

### Post:

Hey everyone!

[The Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/213223018/pay-attention) for "Pay Attention" is 1/3 of the way through its run and is overfunded.  A couple days ago I added a stretch goal, for which I would write a second work:  a 10,000 word (minimum) rational horror novelette.  Well, that's $15 short of funding, so I'm adding ANOTHER stretch goal:  if we get another $500 after this, I'll write a third work:  a 10,000 word (minimum) fantasy story set in the Union of AnundjÃ¥ at the very beginning of the Drauga War.  Here's the blurb:

*Set on the second day of the drauga invasion, High Marshal Albrecht LÃ¶fgren is on a show-the-flag-and-boost-morale inspection of the Tenth Legion, a war-weary band recently rotated off the front lines after too long standing between civilization and the barbarian northmen.  The dining-in is interrupted by horrific news:  a massive undead army is sweeping up the valley below, led by a powerful vampire battlemage and his coterie of Archmage followers.  With less than an hour to prepare, can Albrecht successfully save the lives of the exhausted Legionnaires?*

If everyone who has given $12 or less could find a friend to match their pledge, we'd pretty much make that second stretch goal.

As a final note:  according to the Kickstarter stats, the vast majority of my pledges have come from this subreddit.  Thank you all so very much.  I really can't convey how humblingly wonderful this has been.

  I feel like this Kickstarter could maybe benefit from being posted to /r/hpmor, OP, considering that it draws a much larger population with similar likes. In the meanwhile, I'll try to haggle some people into donating. Seriously looking forward to these stories.

  ETA: How has nobody funded any of the "extra 2000 words" options yet? Grr

    Huh, good thought.  I'll do that, thank you.

      It's a big investment for one person. I should start a kickstarter.
