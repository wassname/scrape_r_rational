  I never felt like a character acting stupid is intrinsically "non rational". I *try* to write rational fic, but if a character is an idiot, they're going to do idiotic things. It's consistent. The problem is an otherwise smart character suddenly falling prey to debilitating stupidity when the plot demands it; not the stupidity, but the *inconsistency*. Mind, that's just a problem with bad writing in general. While the rationalfic community tends to put a lot of stress on intelligence and character thought processes, just giving characters a consistent set of abilities, motivations and flaws should be something *every* half-decent writer does.

  Over time I've come to realize that a lot of things that fall under the umbrella of "rational fiction" tend to just be things that adhere to tropes and conventions that appeal to a particular audience.  This is how most genres tend to operate: vampires used to fall into the domain of "horror" stories that tried to frighten the reader; now, you're more likely to find them in "paranormal" or "urban fantasy" stories that may make no attempt to frighten the reader (apart from the usual worrisome dramatic stakes that accompany any story).  I don't think that's necessarily a problem; I think that genres work best when they are descriptive, not prescriptive, and the most useful descriptions tend to be those that allow you to neatly sort things into buckets of, "If I like X, I will probably also like X2 and X3."  I think a significant portion of the readership on /r/rational is there because they liked HPMOR or Mother of Learning and want to find other stories that scratch the same itch.  (It's also for this reason that I'm hesitant to define the sub's intent in a way that would exclude something like Unsong, because while Unsong isn't exactly a rational story, it most definitely falls under the banner of "stories that would appeal to people who enjoyed HPMOR.")

  Awhile back the Rationally Writing duo made an appearance on the [Bayesian Conspiracy podcast](http://www.thebayesianconspiracy.com/2018/07/63-rational-fiction/), and one of the things that came up was the fact that a big part of the appeal of rational fiction is that there's a certain segment of people that want to read stories about characters that are like them.  This coincidentally overlaps with a [post I just made about the "brains vs brawn fallacy"](http://kineticliterature.com/intelligent-characters-and-the-brains-vs-brawn-fallacy/) and how certain stories about "intelligent" characters are more about appealing to a certain aesthetic ideal than actually demonstrating intelligence:

  >...the audience for written fiction mainly consists of people who enjoy and spend time reading books [...]

  >I suspect that a major reason why “kid goes to wizard school” is so popular as a trope of fantasy that is that it’s essentially created a genre where studying and reading books makes you more capable of dealing with violent conflict. In general, bookish and studious people rarely intersect with violence, and when they do they tend to find their skills poorly matched for dealing with violent conflict, but a wizard school setting allows for a logically consistent story about a character who is a brainy academic who also solves their conflicts with with superior force. [...]

  >The issue with a character who solves their problem just by studying is that when they acquire that skill and then apply it to solve a problem, they’re not really demonstrating intelligence, they’re demonstrating expertise. The wizard’s power appears to be the triumph of brain over brawn, but this is true only in the most superficial sense of what is meant by “brains.” A wizard who defeats his enemies by throwing fireballs at them is not really showcasing his intelligence, even if his method for learning to throw fireballs involved reading a lot of books.

  There are a lot of times when it feels like the kind of works that appeal to the "rational fiction" community do so more by appealing to the aesthetic ideal of intelligence (someone who is an academic who gets their powers from studying) more than someone who actually tries to solve problems rationally.

  There's also a question of how much "rational fiction" as a term should be descriptive of a story's logic, rather than the presence of certain character traits.  I find most of Jane Austen's work to be tremendously "rational" in the sense of having characters whose behavior is internally consistent with the setting and the social context in which they exist; Austen is great precisely because she clearly understood the social dynamics of the setting she lived in (and wrote about).  Everything that happens in her books feels like a logical consequence of everything that preceded it, and her stories make me laugh in the way that I can only laugh at something because it's so incredibly true to life.  But I'm fairly certain that most people would resist a definition of "rational fiction" that includes the work of Jane Austen because her stories are about manners and romance, and people don't generally come to a place like /r/rational to read stories about people who are dealing with problems that are defined mainly in terms of how the protagonist deals with social pressure and trying to understand their own emotions.  That's not something I necessarily see as a problem: as I said before, I think that genres work best as descriptive (not prescriptive) labels.  But I think it does become necessary at a certain point to be intellectually honest about the fact that when talk about "rational fiction" we may be talking about fiction that may or may not be entirely rational, and that there's plenty of fiction that is rational while not falling under that banner.

  I think this is the main point of what this manifesto describes as "irrational fiction," stories that are internally consistent with their logic while featuring characters who behave in ways that we consider "irrational" because they'd rather engage in self-deception that makes them feel happy rather than, like, accumulating resources or increasing their power level.  (I think one the main reasons there seems to be so much overlap between the audiences for "rational fiction" and LitRPG is that "increasing my power level" is sort of the perfect distillation of the "romantic ideal" of rationality, and LitRPG's defining quality is that it expresses "power level" as a simple integer value that can be easily tracked.)

    This rhymes with the [description of rational fiction](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8xqtp0/meta_rrational_characteristics_of_rational/e25rbdl/) that I gave during the sidebar rewrite. Copy-pasting from there:

    > Rational fiction rewards [gears](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/B7P97C27rvHPz3s9B/gears-in-understanding)-seeking.
    > 
    > 
    > By gears-seeking, I mean a stance to reading which is essentially the opposite of suspension of disbelief.
    > 
    > 
    > Suspension of disbelief involves accepting something as a brute fact, not trying to understand how it fits into a broader framework, not asking why, and [not dwelling on it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8w95xIdH4o&t=26s) (as that would interfere with enjoying the story). A gears-seeking reader is doing the opposite of this: looking for the underlying processes behind what's happening, taking each thing that happens as [deeply entangled](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/wyyfFfaRar2jEdeQK/entangled-truths-contagious-lies) with the rest of the world, and being curious about the nature of the coherent world in which these events are taking place. They are letting their world-modeling skills loose on this fictional world.
    > 
    > 
    > One place to see obvious symptoms of this approach is with fictional worlds that fall apart when modeled. Gears-seeking readers will notice plot holes, idiot balls, and similar, including deep flaws as well as nitpicks. Sometimes this leads to attempts to rationalize/retcon the world by devising their own set of underlying processes in which events much like the ones in the original story do fit together coherently. Rational fiction which is intended for gears-seeking readers typically strives for internal consistency, where the world runs on systematic "laws of physics" (even if they involve "magic"), the characters do things which make sense to them at the time, and the society is what you'd get from a whole bunch of these beings with their physics and technologies.
    > 
    > 
    > But internal consistency is not enough; rational fiction also **rewards** gears-seeking. The story is written so that gears-seeking leads to deeper understanding and appreciation of the story. For example, often a character's success depends on figuring out more about how the world works and scheming about how they can use these raw materials to accomplish what they want. If the story provides the reader with enough information about the world, then the story is calling on them to join in on seeking gears and scheming. (One of the main ways that a story fails to be "rational" is by not giving the reader enough information to seek gears; instead it's just one thing after another. The author may have a coherent world in mind, but the reader can't see enough of it to let their mind loose on the world.)
    > 
    > 
    > This is a main reason why rational fiction is often set in a magical world and alien society. Internally consistent realistic stories can just use the actual world as background; they [don't require world-modeling](http://alicorn.elcenia.com/stories/earthfic.shtml) from the author or the reader. Whereas an internally consistent fantasy world can easily call forth efforts to understand the gears behind the laws of magic, how the society ended up as it did, and what awesome opportunities might exist for a person in that world.

    - u/keeper52:
      ```
      Maybe we should have a separate term for stories which "make sense": where there aren't plot holes, where characters act is if they're people with coherent personalities and motivations rather than acting in contrived ways to create drama, where the world doesn't have inexplicable unplucked low-hanging fruit waiting for the protagonist, and so on. Perhaps "coherent fiction". 

      Lots of fiction is coherent (including Jane Austin, I suspect, though I haven't read many of her novels). And many readers prefer coherent fiction (which is why "aren't you just describing *good* fiction" is a common refrain).

      Rational fiction is a subset of coherent fiction, which rewards gears-seeking.

    Something about r/rational has been bugging me for a while now, and I feel like you just perfectly described my problem with it in a way I couldn't quite get a grasp on until now.

- u/PretentiousSmirk:
  ```
  This is actually one of the things I love about The Reckoning. Each of the Animorphs acts rationally and irrationally depending on the situation just like real human beings do. And while they read as particularly bright children, you never quite lose the sense that they're about as short-sighted and emotionally driven as you'd expect teenagers to be.
  ```

- u/t3tsubo:
  ```
  I feel like the blogger just described rationalfic, or at least what i would personally consider rationalfic.

  Especially when it comes to this point on the sidebar:

  * Examination of goals and motives: the story makes reasons behind characters' decisions clear.

  EDIT: Pronouns
  ```

  - u/Aretii:
    ```
    > she 

    Ozy's pronouns are they/them, for what it's worth.

    But yeah, the fact that the characters feel like coherent individuals with internality of their own and not just pawns the author is shuffling around is something I go to rationalfic for.
    ```

    - u/dinoseen:
      ```
      Weird that they'd have those for themselves, but write "she" whenever they're talking about a non-specific character. It's like, they're clearly aware of how pronouns can bother people, but don't take any steps of their own to assuage the mild annoyance a reader might feel. Not exactly a crime, just a bit weird.

  This honestly just sounds like desperately rationalising something. 

  >A character who never follows through on her plans doesn’t have to worry about failing.

  And characters who split up in a horror movie get to cover more ground? What's so wrong with calling obviously stupid behaviour stupid? Why does it always have to have _some_ hidden advantage in it?
  ```

  - u/Anderkent:
    ```
    It's not being argued that the behaviour is not \*stupid\* on net. It's just that every behaviour has \*some\* driving goal behind it, and if you present the character as overvaluing that goal, you can build 'irrational' characters that are still consistent and easy to emphasise with.

    Also I know many people who don't really commit to things much because that way they don't ever fail, I see that in myself a fair bit, I don't think what you're calling out specifically is that ridiculous/obvious?
    ```

  - u/King_of_Men:
    ```
    Ozy does not say that the behaviour is rational, or good. They say that this is what a character might think, consciously or otherwise. If the characters in a horror movie split up explicitly to "cover more ground" (what are they searching for, though?) then that would be the same kind of irrational.
    ```

    - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
      ```
      Yes, but the argument EY made about Thorin went beyond that. His point - which may as well be subjective, of course, it's not a hard science - is that Thorin is too proud and sunk too much into his search for the Mountain to just *throw away the friggin' key*. It's not that it's an irrational behaviour in general. It's a behaviour that doesn't make any sense *for Thorin*, given his past and the person we've known him to be. Almost no one except for a hardcore chaotic character would just decide to toss away years and years of effort in a single moment of rage because of a small roadblock at the last step of the way. "Thorin is impatient" doesn't cut it: if Thorin was impatient *about this*, he wouldn't have ever managed to get to the Misty Mountains to begin with. That's what EY complains about, and I agree with him. It's not that Thorin is an irrational person, it's that Thorin *is not a person*, full stop. He embodies a trope, in that scene, used in a completely nonsensical way.
      ```

      - u/King_of_Men:
        ```
        Sure. And Ozy agrees with that judgement of *the existing movie*, and then they give a way in which the movie could be changed, to build Thorin back up again into a person who would do that, in such a way that the reader would believe it. Probably not in a movie, which are usually terrible at showing a character's inner motivations, but in a text. Or here's a different one: Maybe Thorin has had continual doubts about the authenticity of the map; it's a little convenient, isn't it, this ancient map with the near-riddle (that, as HPJEV would point out, doesn't actually distinguish very well between people who should and shouldn't have access) that just anyone could come across? When the last light fails, Thorin sees his secret doubt confirmed; he has fallen for a scam, he is an idiot and a fool and what's worse, all his friends know it and he's driven them all across the known world for a year just so he can reveal it... A temper tantrum is not unbelievable, if justified this way; a character with this sort of motivation is not acting intelligently, that's true, but they don't have *something missing*. This is a thing that could actually happen, even to someone with the determination to paper over their doubts and get to the Lonely Mountain.
        ```

        - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
          ```
          Ok, but if the movie had built THAT Thorin (which wouldn't be faithful to the *book's* Thorin, but that's another matter), it would still be a Level 1 Intelligent character. Which doesn't make the story irrational, quite the opposite.

          Perhaps, here's how I would put it: the story is *rational* as long as characters have that sort of consistent internal motives, regardless of whether they are actually smart or not. *Rationalist* fiction tends to explore specifically what happens when we apply this logic to extremely smart characters (like Harry James Potter Evans-Verres or Lex Luthor). What Ozy advocates for isn't *irrational* fiction, but rather... err... *irrationalist* fiction, I guess, in which the rational framework (level 1 intelligent characters) is used not to explore the effects of rationality and intelligence, but those of irrationality and stupidity.
          ```

          - u/King_of_Men:
            ```
            At that point we're just arguing semantics. I don't think the Thorin I sketched up above is Level-1 Intelligent; his actions are still a mistake. Ozy's term "Level-1 Irrational" seems sensible to me. But these are just words.
            ```

            - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
              ```
              But in this case I'm specifically harkening back to EY's definition of the term (since he invented it, I'd say it has precedence):

              > step one towards a more intelligent Thorin is just to have Thorin behave like there is a person inside him figuring out the best thing to do, like you or I would in his shoes, as opposed to an H-Zombie who throws down the key in order to provide Bilbo with a Dramatic Moment.

              http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/level1intelligent

              Basically his concept of Level 1 Intelligent doesn't imply anything about the character's IQ, it just means *they're acting like people*. Smart people, stupid people, whatever, but they are the protagonists of their own story and act in consequence rather than doing things that only serve the purposes of the grander plot, and of the actual main character.
              ```

              - u/King_of_Men:
                ```
                Well, and is Insecure!Thorin figuring out the best thing to do? Supposing that he was in fact a fool who had fallen for a scam, would throwing a tantrum be his best policy? Obviously not. This version of Thorin is not acting by author fiat so as to give Bilbo a Dramatic Moment, and he is also not acting rationally, the two options that the sage Yudkowsky is contrasting. He is acting in accordance with being a person, but not an optimising one.
                ```

                - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
                  ```
                  Would *such* an insecure, moody, tantrum-throwing Thorin had had the patience to ever get to Misty Mountains in the first place? He planned this trip, it took years of his life. If only because of the sunk cost fallacy, you'd expect him to insist a little more.

  Harry and Voldemort were arrogant and refused to delegate, while Hermione and McGonagall were stuck in what they were Supposed to Do, etc. Dumbledore was the only character that wasn't obviously irrational (other than putting too much certainty in an afterlife, but, come on, he lives in a universe which is magic)
  ```

- u/PresN:
  ```
  I'm too late to this post (despite still being at #14 in the subreddit) to get off the bottom of the comments, but: for all that the common refrain for newcomers about rational!fic is "just good writing, plus some focus on intelligence/problem solving", this irrational!fic idea is even moreso "just good writing". I appreciate the initial point that "there are more solutions to the idiot ball problem than making the character not make dumb choices", which is definitely a lesson some rational[ist]!fic writers (and especially readers) should learn, but this is really really just "write characters that are people, not plot devices". It's certainly not *bad* writing advice, and likely packaged in a way palatable to RT writers, but it's by no means novel to say that characters should have realistic flaws that inform their character and decisions, and also have some redeeming virtues as well, aka "be people".
  ```

- u/Boron_the_Moron:
  ```
  Why is anyone acting like this is a new idea? This is stuff that writers worked out centuries ago. We don't need some new theory about "level 1 irrational characters". We already have language for this. We certainly don't need a "manifesto" arguing that characters should have flaws. That's something that any fiction writer worth a damn will already tell you.
  ```

  - u/ff29180d:
    ```
    Irrationalfic isn't any more a new idea than rationalfic is. Yes, characters should have flaws, but irrationalfic is making the flaw the primary subject of fiction, just like rationalfic is making the intelligence the primary subject of fiction.
    ```

    - u/Boron_the_Moron:
      ```
      > irrationalfic is making the flaw the primary subject of fiction

      So, like a million other stories that already exist? Plenty of fiction already focuses on the headspaces and behaviours of flawed, irrational characters. Plenty of fiction already shows characters suffering the consequences of their flaws. Ancient Greek Tragedy is built on the idea of the main character being destroyed by their own personal failings. That's one of the oldest narrative structures in history, being well over two millenia old.

      "Irrationalfic" is not doing anything new. It's just re-inventing the wheel.
