## [Request] Sentient Dungeon fic

### Post:

There were two sentient dungeon fics that were posted here some time ago that I haven't been able to find.

The first was about the dungeon making new dungeon levels, it had a giant crocodile boss that liked to read (?), and was sheltering some humans from the oncoming onslaught by some mages.

The other was about some guy who was killed by some sorcerer and had his soul transplanted into a dungeon.

Tbh, they might be the same story, I forgot to save the story and now I can't find it. Any help would be appreciated! And if anyone has recs for other sentient dungeon fics, that would also be appreciated. 

Apologies to the mods in advance if this is not the place to post; this is my first time posting to this subreddit but I've been lurking for a few years.

  Dunno what the mods might say, but I like fic requests, because I get to see the fic once it shows up, and generally I might find it interesting if someone here is looking for it.

    Agreed! This is how I find most of my bizarre online leisure reading.

  It's unfortunate that the Bound Dungeon was abandoned. I have never found another dungeon story quite as good.

  Dungeon born is awesome in my opinion. Don't know if it firs the subreddit but I like it a lot.
