  What’s our engagement like? Are there any websites that can scrape subreddits and say how many accounts are active at any give time (e.g. a sliding window checking for 2 or more posts in a 2 month period, or something). Though I guess lurkers shouldn’t be discounted, either (nor users who browse without accounts — is there any way to check unique pageviews or other analytics?).

  The sidebar says 89 people are currently active, though *it is* Xmas eve haha. That’s about as many usernames as I might vaguely recognize from here, personally. I’d also wonder how many “subscribers” correspond to individual posters, too (I’ve probably used maybe half a dozen + accounts in over a decade of posting on Reddit, all of which would be subscribed to here haha).

    Seven hours ago was Christmas for most everyone. I wonder what the geographic distribution is

    I think that's what "X users here now " is for. That said, I haven't found anything good in the submissions recently, so I've stopped looking at them. The weekly threads are really the only thing I occasionally check.

      Gotcha — I always thought that was for a narrower window, like how many people might be logged in with a tab open in the last 12h or something (as in, those users are “actively” looking at the front page). Googling quickly I can’t seem to find a reliable answer though haha.

      These days I mostly just stick to the Monday rec thread, too, alongside occasional periodically updating fics that get top-level posts.
