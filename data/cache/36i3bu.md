  Okay, I'm calling it now: *Twig* is every bit as good as *Worm*, and from here can only get better. 

  Wildbow has made some huge investments in the cast these past two arcs, and has prepared some devastating drama for the future as the Lambs approach their expiration dates -- and with another timeskip this chapter, that doesn't seem too far off -- not to mention Sly's knowledge of Mary's not-code. The prose is simultaneous brisk and *dense*, with more plentiful and better humor than most stories. 

  I am so very happy with where this story can go, it's ridiculous. There is no longer any reason whatsoever to pass on this one. It will be quite the ride.

    Absolutely.

    Where Worm feels like a television series, or a very long single novel. Twig comes across as a series of movies or the traditional, episodic serialized fiction popular in the magazines of the era when this story is set. The dime novels Jamie was trading for back in the first arc are an even closer match.

    Delightfully, and unlike either Worm or Pact, this allows the tension to ratchet up... and then *release* on a regular basis. The sense of dread and despair that soaked both of the previous works is not nearly so strong here.

    The world is bleak and crapsack overall, but the worst doesn't last long and our focus tilts back towards wit and fun soon enough. Slime and shadows at the periphery, adventure front and center.

    I haven't been able to take the time to read it, but can you tell me (without spoilers) if you think this is rationalist?

    Note that I am sure it's well-written, I'm solely asking about rationality.

      Not rationalist, really. Rational for sure though. It ticks all the boxes of the checklist in the sidebar.

        >The story shows rationalist techniques, which can be applied by readers.

        Wildbow absolutely is 100% behind Sychology as working *great* in the real world. Stir the anthill, lay your traps - it's the key to social success!

          What is Sychology? A quick Google just gives me articles where people seem to have written Psychology wrong.

          - u/None:
            ```
            The viewpoint character of *Twig* is named Sy. He manipulates people by thrusting unpredictable circumstances over them and making the path of least resistance *his* way. He views humans under stress as a bunch of billiard balls, rebounding chaotically, and has a terrifying intuitive sense of how to make someone break in precisely the right way.

            Thus, Sychology.
            ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      It's rational. Characters are not only smart but smart with their own very real, effective *styles* - Sy breeds chaos and leverages it, Gordon sashays into the dynamic and turns it to his ends, Jamie collects information to use as a scalpel, etc.
      ```
