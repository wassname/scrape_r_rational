  Damn, I did not expect things to go that way. I guess I've been thinking of Cat as the hero, and anticipating tropes along those lines. When a hero takes a dangerous chance to increase their power in a desperate situation, I expect them to succeed and boost their power just in time to save the day. But Cat's a villain, and when a villain tries that things usually end poorly for them.

  Still, Squire is a transitional name, so hopefully when she becomes a Knight she'll get all three aspects.

  So apparently one attempting to remove the taint of a corruption demon can permanently damage a name. This seems like a poorly thought out plot point to me. We intentionally don't know much about names but if you can permanently damage a name by accident why hasn't the Black Knight been crippling the heroes he kills first so that they come back weaker?

    That's a good point actually. I don't think Black would fuck around with demonic corruption, but if it's possible to mutilate a Name permanently without first infecting it with a demon it seems like something he might have done. Perhaps heroic Names have more divine protection than villainous ones. Or maybe Black didn't consider it necessary since his plan was to change the culture of Callow enough that they'd stop getting their traditional names and start getting Praesi Names instead, like what's happened with Cat.

  I started reading this web novel recently, and I have a question about some older stuff.

  Namely, the rules of War College games seem a bit weird. For example, what stops any team from just handing their flag to a good scout and order him to hide and not come back under any circumstances, essentially securing a draw if hey lose the battle itself?
