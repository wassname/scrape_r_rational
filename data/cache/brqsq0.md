  To be honest, this sounds like one of those religious facebook stories. The kind where someone accomplishes some incredible feat, and then reveals that Belief is what made it possible. Just swap Belief for Probability.

  From a probabilistic perspective, though, I'd agree with the antagonists. The factors that lead to Riya winning the bet (a sudden intensification of rainfall, the teacher getting stuck on a nail) do not actually seem probable.

  Also, why was she upset at the beginning of the story, if she had such confidence that the rain would stop before the end of class?
