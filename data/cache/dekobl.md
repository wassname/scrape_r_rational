## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  Discovered Royal Road and am having my heart repeatedly broken by starting great stories and then finding they aren't finished yet.  The ones I read that are actually good are *The Salamanders*  (not rational fic but great characterization and magic system) *Mother of Learning*, and *Eight*.  (The last isn't rationalist but has an unusually practical protagonist).  Started an awful lot of drivel before I found those gems.

  Really looking for more protagonists that are pragmatic. Too many portal fantasy feature characters that are sucked into another world and instantly shout "Wee!" and dive into a deadly Dungeon full of Monsters.  Or decide to Conquer the World or Become the Strongest in the World. Cultivation novels and urban fantasy seem to make a point of having the hero mouth off to stupidly powerful people or monsters.  I know I'm supposed to be impressed with how they stick to their guns but I just think "You're an idiot".

  What books are out there where the protagonist is..pragmatic?  Picks attainable goals, doesn't behave recklessly, sucks up to the powerful when necessary?Now, "pragmatic" doesn't necessarily mean evil...I've asked this question elsewhere and got a plethora of villain protagonist suggestions.  This is related to but not identical to "rationalist" as this community seems to define it.  Some rationalist fiction features heroes that  introduce rationalist scientific ideas to fantasy worlds, but some of those feature megalomaniacal and reckless characters who preach the idea of rationality.  


  Oh...English language fiction.  I've learned I have to specify that now...I find most Japanese translations I find online unreadable.

    > Cultivation novels and urban fantasy seem to make a point of having the hero mouth off to stupidly powerful people or monsters. I know I'm supposed to be impressed with how they stick to their guns but I just think "You're an idiot".

    You know, I was just thinking the other day that it could be interesting to see a Cultivation novel that really addresses this. It almost feels like by following their daos relentlessly and allowing no doubt, they're trading physical and spiritual strength for mental weakness. For any such setting to make sense, it has to be a genuine advantage - people who don't recklessly act like idiots genuinely can't progress.

    So, what if you had a protagonist who tried to deal with this? Rather than having a secret bloodline or a ghost mentor hidden in a ring, they could have some spell or ability to temporarily make themselves just as foolhardy and reckless as everyone else, that's generally unknown because everyone with "authority" in the setting who comes across it sees it as a crutch that could only hold the user back - improbable in the real world, but less so in a setting that actively rewards pigheadedness.

    You'd have a character who'd act rationally and try to put themselves in the best possible position, like any smart person... who then has to flip a switch to cultivate and fight, and pray they don't do anything too stupid before they turn it off.

    As for your actual request... I've found Super Minion to be pretty great, along with RE: Trailer Trash. The former's set in a world opf superpowers, and is pretty great - the latter is more of a real-life Peggy Sue.

      I have many beefs with Cultivation novels.  I have serious beefs with the 'Grow Strong Enough No One Can Ever Hurt Me" mantra in many of them.  Always comes off vaguely fascist to me.  And is intrinsically impossible in both the real world and most fictional worlds.  I'd love to see a Cultivation novel that deconstructed this and had a hero that learned that groups of people working together are stronger then any individual.    


      *Street Cultivation* by Sarah Lin had an unusually sane protagonist...he realized the Tournaments were stupidly dangerous particularly for someone without heath insurance in case he got injured.

        I personally find the relentless path of self-improvement to be interesting, in that where other genres and settings have caveats to such, xianxia doubles down on it. It's all the horrible trappings that come with it that I'm less a fan of - some make sense as being derived from a society where "Might makes Right" is more or less a physical law, but some's just pretty gnarly. As you say, IRL such attitudes are pretty damn fascist.

        Some of it might just be the worldview of the culture it's from - I don't know much about Chinese cultural views, but my experience with them in professional settings is that cutthroat ruthlessness is pretty much expected over there.

        I tried a cultivation novel a few weeks ago, and it was just so... dry. The protagonist just sat in a room meditating and reached various stages of cultivation or whatever, and the story let us know that this was supposed to be impressive, but just... ugh. I had absolutely *no* emotional connection to this style of progression.

        Anyway, your comment made me realize another problem I had with it: it was just *so* every-person-for-themself, which just made me hate all the characters. If it's just going to be a power fantasy it should at least have wish fulfillment, right? But I got no enjoyment imagining myself in this place with those people. I wonder if this is endemic to the genre.

          >*I tried a cultivation novel a few weeks ago, and it was just so... dry. The protagonist just sat in a room meditating*

          That's unusual.  Usually there is lots of kung fu fighting, martial arts tournaments, vendettas with spoiled nobles.  The "Every Man For Himself" part is typical.

          Generally I just don't care.  A magic system where the only "magic" is improved karate chops and the prize at the end is to be the the baddest dog in the junkyard (and even that prize is a perpetually receding mirage).  


          I'm totally into books where the character improves himself...but just improving his physical strength isn't a kind of improvement I can get excited about.

          Some of them aren’t that dry, they spice it up with rape and torture. Usually it’s the main character doing it as ‘righteous retribution’. Slaughter and genocide are pretty common themes once the characters can. 

          As someone who spent far too much time on them, I can say that yes it being boring is endemic. It also marks those stories as the good ones.

        I'll second [Street Cultivation](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/23220/street-cultivation-a-modern-wuxialitrpg-hybrid) as a worthwhile read with a sane cultivator protagonist.

        I bought the book after reading the sample chapters and wasn't disappointed. As a bonus, she's just starting to release the second book. Same as the first one, all of the chapters will be available on Royal Road first before the book is published by amazon, at which point only the sample chapters will remain.

          Street Cultivation is great. The protagonist is relatable, Granny Whitney is a well deserved addition to the hall of badass old ladies of fantasy, the worldbuilding makes sense, and people have a diverse verity of believable goals.

        I haven't been able to get into cultivation novels except by proxy (*Cradle*), so I am curious: do they emphasize the importance of the state the way fascists did? To [quote Mussolini](http://www.worldfuturefund.org/wffmaster/Reading/Germany/mussolini.htm):

        > Anti-individualistic, the Fascist conception of life stresses the importance of the State and accepts the individual only in so far as his interests coincide with those of the State ... The Fascist conception of the State is all embracing; outside of it no human or spiritual values can exist, much less have value. ... the Fascist  State  - a synthesis and a unit inclusive of all values - interprets, develops, and potentates the whole life of a people.
        ```

        - u/EdLincoln6:
          ```
          > do they emphasize the importance of the state the way fascists did? 

          No.  Quite the opposite.  That's not one of the fascist tendencies they have.   

           They come out as vaguely fascist to me because people influenced by fascism and lots of tin-pot dictators often talk a lot about "strength" as the be-all end all.  If anything cultivation novels seem more like Hitler's brand of fascism with it's obsession with strong Aryan supermen, but I'm hesitant to make that comparison because the whole racism and genocide thing tends to overshadow everything else about Hitler.  

          It might be more precise to say it is vaguely Nietzschesque in it's obsession with individual strength and ruthlessness, and I tend to associate people getting over-emotional about over-simplified versions of Nietzsche's philosophies with crypto fascists.
          ```

          - u/ahasuerus_isfdb:
            ```
            Ah, I see. So "individual strength and will over all else", right? If so, then the fascist ideology had some similarities -- "quality rather than quantity" and "the mightiest because the most ethical, the most coherent, the truest", to quote the same article -- but the context was different. Fascism valued "quality" and "mightiest" individuals because they were supposed to form the elite of the state and of the nation, which were seen as the pinnacle of human existence. In that they were similar to other "vanguard" movements of the 20th century, which valued individual strength only in the service of a "vanguard party", which, in turn, served a higher goal, be it race, nation or class. They had no use for a purely individualistic philosophy.
            ```

    - u/baml3:
      ```
      Devourer of Destiny was the pinnacle of cultivation novels, but it author took it down because they were getting too much shit for ‘only’ releasing once a day. Too much as in having dozens of people ordering them to write more, despite it being free. The main character was the old guy in the ring, using the people he taught to rise in power. Very much evil protagonist, but damn if it wasn’t a good character. The PDF still exists somewhere, but the story is dead.

      Journey of an Old Dreamer is a cultivation novel where the protagonist is actually moral. As in modern day morals, and not stupid as a brick. I lost interest in it, but I think it’s still being written.

      Cultivating Civilization was about a military guy who got sent to a cultivation world. No talent, no resources, no special powers. Builds his own army, and tries to strip the mysticism from cultivation. Was really great, but the author stopped writing. I think it was because of their reader’s disappointment when the main character didn’t suddenly become a god.

      I Think cultivation novels are always going to be trash, not because they can’t be done well, but because their community is going to ruin it.

      Street Cultivation has a fairly rational charachter in a cultivation novel but it was taken off Royal Road after being completed. 

      Delve is also fairly rational. Not in a homo economics way, but in a normal guy with normal goals way.

    The Daily Grind is fantastic. It was completed a while ago and now it's started up again with a sequel. Probably the most realistic rendition of the idea of a "dungeon" I've ever seen. Really good stuff. 

    He Who Fights With Monsters is good. Dungeon Engineer is good. Delve is fine. The Silver Mana is good. Undermind is great. Metal and Magic is great. None of these are finished, though - but they are regularly updating. 

    Zombie's Journey is complete, and pretty good. Intelligent zombie protagonist, still a man eating zombie.
    ```

    - u/TheColourOfHeartache:
      ```
      Your likes seem to align with mine so I'd better give Undermind and the Silver Mana a try. Looks like Undermind isn't a dungeon core, honestly I'm surprised with that name.

      I'd say Delve is one of the best of the best on Royal Road. The Daily Grind, loved the world building of the dungeon but wasn't too keen on the charachters. I prefer the author's other fic: Draw of the Unknown. 

      He Who Fights With Monsters; I can see the quality in the fic. I really want to like it. But the way he just grabbed the first set of essences without even considering alternatives, a lifepath, or synergy with his racial abilities just *really* bugged me.

    >Oh...English language fiction. I've learned I have to specify that now...I find most Japanese translations I find online unreadable.

    I agree with you on the Japanese (and Korean, and Chinese) stories largely being lacking when it comes to translating, but it's amazing how many English series I've found that would benefit from a brief spellcheck. There are so many syntax and grammar problems in what would otherwise be an enjoyable series that it really becomes a headache to continue.

    Anyways, I think you might like *Eight*, which is about a guy who is transported/reincarnates into another world. He tries to make it to a city, but the guards think he's a monster and drive him off, so he ends up living in the wilderness and has to start from scratch, making flint tools, figuring out how to start a fire and hunt. He also lives with a magic otter that's pretty cool.

    *RE: Trailer Trash* is also worth a read. It's about an old woman who gets transported back to her past teenage self. She doesn't have any magic powers or anything. Her main goal is to improve her life, given that she currently lives in a trailer park. It's harder than you'd think as the only real asset she has is future knowledge but no spare cash, rich friends, hidden treasures, just herself and what she can push herself to do.

      Web novels have no editors, and it shows.  There are also some writers I'm convinced are imitating badly translated Japanese Isekai, treating awkwardly translated idioms as intentional details to be immitated.  And I don't really like it when a novel goes "HAHAHAHA".    


      I'm reading *Eight* and love it.  I like that the hero has some sense of the risks and is trying to minimize them.  I also like he retains his memories of his old life and they are plot relevant.  A lot of authors on Royal Road have the protagonist lose his memories of our world...which defeats the whole point of having him come from our world, and often makes them rather flat.  It's a bonus that he's not another sad sack loner gamer.  And I think the author gets the degree of starting advantage to give the hero just right.

    [Record of a Mortal's Journey to Immortality](https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/rmji) has a cautious and pragmatic protagonist.

    'Pragmatic' is the middle name of [Mushoku Tensei's](https://old.reddit.com/r/LightNovels/comments/5re405/mushoku_tensei_epub_volume_124/) protagonist. It's got an obscene dose of wish fulfillment, Japanese beta personalities and awkward anime tropes and this isn't a great intro but the actual intro tells you straight off he's a pathetic piece of shit. It's still one the better isekais from the royalroad/light novel bin because the guy's earnest in reliving his life and everyone likes a redemption story. Its flaws aside, the protagonist and his reactions to his new life are more true to his self than most self inserts where you can feel there's some sort of mask or filter. Just like the protagonist, the story's average at everything [except plot twists] but the whole is more than the sum of its parts. warning: it's still a translation but readable

    Ordered by my enjoyment


    1) Displaced has hands down the best world building I’ve seen in any online story, the characters are amazing, but there are a lot of them. The POV changes to completely different story threads, and there isn’t a main character. That’s not a bad thing, but it can be off putting, especially the first time.

    2) Delve is what would happen if a munchkin went to a fantasy world. The characters are alright but not really THE focus. A lot of numbers, and a book smart protagonist.

    3) Worth the Candle is on royal road, I’m not sure if you’ve read it on Ao3. Probably the closest to what you’ve described. Great character growth, incredibly well written, amazing world building. It does go on some pretty long tangents, and can be a tad political. Overall very much worth reading.

    4) He Who Fights Monsters is very enjoyable, with a smart protagonist, fits very well with your listed character traits. I would highly recommend it, but it doesn’t have much to do with science or technology.

    5) Super Minion has a Android for a protagonist. More of a comedy than anything serious. Decidedly not finished, and very slow updates, but I would still recommend it.

    You should also read RE: Trailer Trash. It’s not the genres you asked for, but it’s fucking amazing.

      > 2) Delve is what would happen if a munchkin went to a fantasy world. The characters are alright but not really THE focus. A lot of numbers, and a book smart protagonist.

      I wouldn't call Rain a munchkin. His build is the most straight forward build of all: Just auras and metamagic feats that work on Auras. Rain's just obsessed with calculating every detail of the system. 

      I would call it a rational build though. Rain doesn't have system knowledge or the time/money to get some. So he picks a straight forward build. 

      He desperately needs help in this new world, so he picks a support build.

      Seconding re: Trailer Trash. Its a peggy sue story, technically, but that is *not* the advantage the main character is exploiting. -She honestly cant remember the news from when she was fifteen the first time around all that well, and the model of time travel is decidedly not on rails, butterfly effects are going to completely derail the history she does recall well far before she gets that far along. 

       Instead, it appears that time travel surgically removes all akrasia. Shonen Jump protagonists would be intimidated by the determination of the protag to "Do Better". This is just a delight to read.

  I've been playing a lot of Neptune's Pride lately (basically [Risk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_(game)) in Space™) and I'm a bit hooked on the diplomacy of these types of games.

  Basically, I'm looking for a story where the focus is on the protagonist trying to get things done while taking into account that their 'allies' could betray them whenever it benefits them. Bonus points for diplomacy, plotting and spying.

  I can't remember anything I've read that focused totally on this, but the army fighting chapters of HPMOR are my go-to example for this.

    [The Empire Trilogy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_Trilogy) is my go-to recommendation for this kind of thing. It is part of the larger Riftwar Cycle, but occurs on another planet, so you don't need to read any of the other books. Set in a fantasy empire inspired by Ancient China and Japan, Mara of the Acoma has to rebuild her family's fortune. Which she does mainly through alliances and posturing rather than actual battle.

    [Shogun](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sh%C5%8Dgun_(novel)) (which is almost certainly an inspiration for the above), set at the end of the Japanese Sengoku Jidai period has a similar feel, but as our point-of-view character is a foreigner, we just see the edges of the conflict, so I prefer the Empire Trilogy.

    ```

    - u/meangreenking:
      ```
      Honestly its not that complicated at all, the site has a list of rules which are fairly simple in practice. A few tips for the road from someone who's won 2/3 games he's played:

      1) Try to get a tech trading agreement for every technology (aside from the one you are researching). This assures you will never fall behind in any technology, and be ahead of most people.

      2) Try to talk to any be friends with everyone even if you are planning on murdering them next. It minimizes the chance of you being attacked and maximizes the chances of your attack succeeding due to them being unprepared.

      3) Expand. If you sit there doing nothing you will 100% lose to the person that does expand faster then you. Thus you pretty much always want to be either expanding or planning an expansion (eg. moving your ships into position just outside their radar range, waiting for them to be attacked be someone else so you can move in and kill them).

      4) Don't hesitate to backstab people if needed. There can only be one winner, and if you don't exploit all the chances open to you it probably won't be you.

      5) Keep your economy strong and don't put all your money into ships/research, otherwise you will fall behind over time due to being poor. I don't remember the exact ratio since its been ages, but you probably want it equal or even better to your ships.

      6) Most importantly, check the game as much as possible. All else being equal if you check it every hour you will slaughter someone that checks it every 8 and it is often the difference between defending from an attack perfectly and getting slaughtered.

      tl;dr: Tech trade up the wazoo, be friends with everyone, expand, ruthlessly murder your friends, invest in economy, check the game as much as possible.

  So this would be better suited for the Friday Open Thread, but Friday is the day I need this done by and it is a request for recommendations, of a sort, so I'm putting it here. Sorry! It has to do with Bayes and multimedia, so it kinda fits ;]

  In short, I've recently been tasked with leading [a group on Bayesian stats](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/da1pda/d_friday_open_thread/f1mygbs/) and want my cat to be its mascot [for obvious reasons](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/cbffha/wellness_wednesday_thread_for_july_10_2019/etfr6ot/).

  To that end, I've run his face through one of many neural algorithms for artistic style transfer to get a feel for what sorts of stylized, abstracted possibilities best suit him.

  Which of these styles do you like the most?

  I'd probably be cutting his face out, or maybe his face and forepaws that they might luxuriously drape over the P in P(Θ|X) or something. Maybe rustle up some versions of him in profile walking or something. I'd also do some smart upscaling and color editing, etc.

  Thank you for any suggestions!

    The details in these images are way too small relative to the scale of the image, of you want this to be a mascot or logo for the group and not a painting that hangs on the wall in the office. If you start from a lower-resolution input image, or increase the size of the pattern being stylistically applied, you may get better results.

    I liked 1, 3, and 15. Whatever you decide, make sure to look at it in both full size and icon size- The latter is how you'll be seeing it most of the time, and making it eyecatching/interesting at that size is important.

  I finished binging Cradle, and am suffering from post good book depression, while waiting for PGtE and Forge of Destiny to update. What should I read next? I love more group of socialization based progression fantasy, rather than an isolationist hermit.

  Also Ziel is best boi

    What did you like about the cradle series? I started the first book but it did not immediately grip me.
    ```

    - u/Throwoutawaynow:

      My favorite thing was the breadth. The first book was okay, but as the series continued it opened up a ton more, and the feeling of progression, from when you meet the first underlord and he’s so above everyone else, to when basically everyone is an underlord and they’re fodder. You are shown so many different paths and fight strategies, and so many odd characters. Along with the personalities associated with the vague powersets and tropes you saw when Suriel showed Lindon the Monarchs(those insanely powerful people she said could save the valley). Also while the individual characters are good but not great, the dynamics between them are fantastic. Also, the character motivations make genuine sense, based on their pasts, and the antagonists are very rarely portrayed as genuinely evil, and the grief of those around them is shown if they die. 

      I could ramble on and on, all I can say is it’s very solid.  Wouldn’t say it does a certain thing in a revolutionary way, but it does everything very well. 

      Did you have any particular issues with it?
      ```

      - u/MisterCommonMarket:

        No particular issue really i just have hard time getting into cultivation stories sometimes. Cant really pinpoint why that is. Weirdly the same thing goes for anime where they shout their attacks out loud even though the exact same thing in a Practical Guide to Evil feels bad ass to me. I can't really articulate why.
        ```

        - u/Throwoutawaynow:
          ```
          I couldn’t say, but I am curious why Cradle was an issue then, because it’s effectively not a cultivation story till the end of book 2, since the main character has basically no ability and is miles below anyone around him. But yeah, nothing wrong with not getting into something.
          ```

    - u/nytelios:

      I see it frequently recommended, but like every other cultivation story, I didn't like it. It's mostly the monotonous grindy conceit of cultivation where it's one faceless fish after another bigger pond, but the characters and interactions felt pretty artificial as well.
      ```

      - u/fassina2:
        ```
        It's very well structured, and it fixes most of the world building problems other stories with this setting overlook.. The power cap is explained early on and it has not been increased and seems like it won't ever be.

        &#x200B;

        The way that guy described power progression as Underlords being 'fodder', was really badly put. There are really very few of them, it's just that aging isn't really a thing, and they are at a world tournament where the most powerful representatives of the 6 world rulers under 35 compete. There are technically thousands of them, but this is in a world with 1 billion plus people, so it makes complete sense.

        &#x200B;

        And it's hardly a grind, compared to the kind of story most people here are into the pacing is astronomical. It's one of those stories you can't put down after you get into it.
        ```

        - u/nytelios:

          Sorry it's just not my thing. I'm not sold on the premise of cultivation stories. It doesn't matter how many cultivators there are when it's still fighting one guy after another just to be the biggest baddest immortal. Feels like a tedious slog, especially when the characters aren't exciting.
          ```

          - u/fassina2:

            That's a bad way of looking at a story. You could reduce most fantasy, scifi, stories, and even life in general in a similar manner and it'd just as easy to make them look boring or bad.. 

            The depth of the characters is dependent on pacing, the faster the pacing the less character development you can get.

            It is ultimately very similar to Litrpgs in general, if you like that it's pretty much the same thing with an asian twist. Train, get stronger, fight baddies, get loot and power ups.. 

            But instead of 100 levels there are less than 10 and the power differences between each level are greater.

            It's ok though, different people have different levels of openness. Myself for instance, will never read the my little pony fanfiction that get's recommended here frequently, ever and nothing will change my mind on it.

              I'm not saying escalation or scaling fights are bad; the typical cultivation/xianxia premise is just distasteful, i.e. punching harder will make them immortal and what do they do with that immortality? Punch immortals harder. I've heard that *Forty Millenniums of Cultivation* is an exception, but I haven't tried it yet.

              > The depth of the characters is dependent on pacing, the faster the pacing the less character development you can get.

              That's a (mostly) false dichotomy. Character depth and pacing are very loosely correlated. Excess pagetime isn't necessary to make characters interesting. Cultivation characters unfortunately seem one-dimensional as a matter of course.

              > It is ultimately very similar to Litrpgs in general, if you like that it's pretty much the same thing with an asian twist. Train, get stronger, fight baddies, get loot and power ups..t

              Yep, which is why I dislike almost all litRPGs just as much. Cultivation is replaced by leveling, but the focus is still getting stronger. There's "character" development, but no *character* development if you catch my drift (couldn't resist). Though I think litRPG is easier to storytell around, compared to creating a universe where cultivation and cultivator dogfights make sense as a fact of life. I love the concept of the litRPG, but the execution is usually short-sighted or shallow.

              I've been open to cultivation, just been disappointed.

    Garth Nix's Abhorsen series, and Ann Leckie's Imperial Radch series, together seem like good "socialization of a MC" stories.

    Read Lord of the Mysteries. Its a new favorite over at r/noveltranslations because it takes a very unique twist on the xianxia genre. The MC is very likeable, and the story’s plot is actually well thought out.

  This new HumbleBundle has a bunch of sci-fi and fantasy sagas:

  I've already bought Tier 1 and am quite enjoying the Age of Unreason books. Does anyone have any advice re: the rest of it? For example, Tier 1 has only the first 3 books for the Dragonback series, is it worth reading? Goodreads seems to have quite a high average score for it.

    The most brilliantly evil yet still likeable main character I've ever read was [Twig](https://soundcloud.com/professorcrispy/wormilton-opening-number)'s Sylvester. Raised on a regime of drugs that keep his brain malleable, trained together with a group of children, molding himself into a master social manipulator, used by the British Crown as state-sponsored terrorists. Twig is the coming-of-age story of these kids, all of whom are experiments of an amoral Academy.

        True, he's not *really* evil, when you see everything from his own POV, then he's merely chaotic, manipulative, destructive, and often erratic.  
        But he will not hesitate a second to sacrifice some random human to save the life of a friend of his, and even war crimes, horrific torture and murder are never something he shies away from.

        A bit much? He lies and kills people both directly and indirectly. Sure, he doesn't kick puppies but if his objectives by kicking a thousand puppies he would do it without guilt or shame.
