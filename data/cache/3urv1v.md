        I am getting the feeling that almost every person Zorian met in the first few chapters is actually important in some way.

        Alternatively, the whole story has a theme of everyone is important in their own lives and every person you bypass has an important life you could have been a part of.

          Veyers Boronova is the bully who got expelled before the story even started, right? I saw a theory somewhere that he's Red Robe simply because he was mentioned in the first few chapters so that means he *has* to pop up later on. We probably will see him later, but I don't know if he'll be Red Robe or not. Red Robe is *probably* someone who's name we already know, and I don't think he's Damien like some people do.

  If Zorian is going to be doing combat sparring then he needs to do it how he'd do it in the field. That means mind attacks while doing physical attacks and using items, he's nerfing himself hard to fight on an even playing field with Taiven. If he used items and mind magic he'd likely mop the floor with her and need to fight two people at once. If he intentionally wasn't using mind magic I'd hope for at least a line about it, but nothing.

  Finally we are getting into the part of the story where Zorian does everything, he hasn't been exploiting this enough. He has infinite money, why not buy mercenaries and go kill bad guys and dragons and stuff to get combat experience? Or get the best personal instruction from all the best masters in the world like Taiven said. I truly don't think Zorians excuse of being busy is enough, he could have had people teaching him from day one. Money is power, yet Zorian only thought of the idea years later.

  I think it's more of a personality flaw than anything, which is fair. Zorian (despite all his complaints) is a simple hard worker, he gets a task and completes it to the end, no matter how boring or harsh. He doesn't look for exploits or loop holes really. He hasn't really taken advantage of the time loop yet. Sure he's gotten teacher and spider help by tricking them or giving away things that won't matter at the end of the reset, but nothing major. 

  Anyone from r/rational could exploit the time loop better, but I doubt many of us would work as hard. Different methodologies but looking for exploits would probably win every time, after all you only need one good exploit to become very powerful.


  Also as a side note why do people never erect shields that protect them as they move? Shields seem pretty useless unless you are prepared for an attack as they are stationary.

    >If Zorian is going to be doing combat sparring then he needs to do it how he'd do it in the field.

    Combat reflexes are very useful for fights. By focusing single mindedly on those he is giving himself a valuable head up- mind magic is erratically reliable against prepared mages, items are very context dependent, combat reflexes almost always work. He can later learn how to incorporate mind magic and items into that style.

    >Finally we are getting into the part of the story where Zorian does everything, he hasn't been exploiting this enough. He has infinite money, why not buy mercenaries and go kill bad guys and dragons and stuff to get combat experience?

    He explained in chapter. He's continually been facing issues that require him to build up some skill (recently, that mental packet which is degrading and which carries critical information and red cloak) and hasn't had time for a more ambitious approach. He has been trying to get the best instruction from the best masters in the world in mind magic. He has advanced mind readers, and enough mind magic and combat item magic to defeat most enemies he faces.

    >Money is power, yet Zorian only thought of the idea years later.

    He only got money recently and only recently got back to Cyoria in a safe way. Years is an exaggeration.

    >Anyone from r/rational could exploit the time loop better, but I doubt many of us would work as hard. Different methodologies but looking for exploits would probably win every time, after all you only need one good exploit to become very powerful.

    He has potent exploits- powerful mind magic, invisibility, bombs, golems. He's made excellent use of those to punch well out of his weight class, but he does face a big issue- he faces many enemies, and one good exploit can be countered by their allies. He needs lots of good exploits. A lot of that comes from his hard work. I don't know how well /r/rational people would do with gathering enough tricks to beat everyone.

      >He has potent exploits- powerful mind magic, invisibility, bombs, golems.

      So does every other mage worth their salt(other than the mind magic part) thats not an exploit. 

      The memory pack is a problem which can probably be solved in a couple months by a mixture of single minded research while ignoring everything else, money and time travel trickery.

      The problem is Zorian is doing exactly what Zack is doing, he's trying to get good enough to beat the invasion on his own. He has two allies and only because they basically fell into his lap. He's not thinking big enough. You can't out hard work an entire country, you need men and troops of your own.
      ```

      - u/Nepene:
        ```
        >So does every other mage worth their salt(other than the mind magic part) thats not an exploit. 

        Do you have evidence for invisibility, bombs and golem being common knowledge to every other mage worth their salt?

        >The memory pack is a problem which can probably be solved in a couple months by a mixture of single minded training while ignoring everything else, money and time travel trickery.

        Not really, successful mind magic stuff requires dedicated trainers who only help him a certain number of hours. Hence why he sought out the Aranea.

        >The problem is Zorian is doing exactly what Zack is doing, he's trying to get good enough to beat the invasion on his own. he has two allies only because they came to him. He's not thinking big enough. You can't out hard work an entire country, you need men and troops of your own.

        He's trying to find the best way to defeat the invasion. He already has one way, destroy the gate. He is intelligently seeking out weak points in their force which he can manipulate- he may be able to single handedly beat the invasion on his own. That's not his focus now though, he's gathering intel.

          He's only spent a couple of years any combat mage would still have years of experience on him to learn golem and invisibility or whatever is combat relevant
          ```

          - u/Nepene:
            ```
            Combat mages tend to have less good shaping skills. More mana means worse shaping. Invisibility and golem making may not be a useful skill for them to spend a lot of time learning the shaping skills to perform. They're more assassin skills.
            ```

  - u/nytelios:
    ```
    Uh, why would he be using mind magic in a spar against a friend? The whole point of sparring is to learn something from it. What does he get by mind blasting down them down, when he is already learning how to use it against the invaders?

    He doesn't have infinite money. It's only however much mana crystals he can collect at the start, which only get refreshed at the start of the loop. He can't go kill bad guys and dragons like a superhero, because that shit gets on the news. Red Robe will come say hello.

    You claim anyone, yourself included, from r/rational can exploit the loop better but all you're suggesting is a fast and easy way to get destroyed by Red Robe.
    ```

  - u/ProfessorPhi:
    ```
    Honestly, if mind magic was included, he'd end Taiven almost instantly, if he comes across an enemy Xvim, he needs to be prepped. 

    I read this story and Zorian makes me feel like I need to work much harder in my everyday life lol.

    I decided to make an easy step-by-step list of how Zorian can completely break the time loop and win easily. This is what I would do, though I have a few advantages over Zorian as I'm exploit minded and less anti-social as well as being grey morally.

    1- We've been shown he can get tons of money from crystallized mana from only one dungeon, now map out EVERY profitable dungeon and do that, you are now the richest man in the world basically. 

    2- Use that money to buy a team of the best researchers and trainers money can buy. He can optimize this team every month by picking new members etc and can throw huge amounts of money at the problem. Take potions, drugs whatever to stop sleeping during the month, so what if it hurts his body, he'll be fine next month.

    He can be taught exactly what he wants in the most efficient manner. Focus the best researchers and every soul mage you can find on understanding the time loop and improving his own soul defense and attacks. Also develop his mind magic as much as possible.

    3- Buy a core group of mercenaries that will make up his "honor guard" optimize the best people for this job over time. Use this group to get valuable combat experience and leadership experience. Fight dragons and baddies and whoever and get enough illegal spells and equipment that you become a powerhouse.

    4- Understand how to stop the loop (it is implied that he just needs to beat the invaders). Once your sure when the time loop will end focus on training and exploiting as much as possible until there are 6 months to a year left before the loop fully degrades.

    5- Buy a big mercenary army, conduct guerrilla warfare during the entire month the invaders are there, cripple them until they are desperate. When they attack mop the floor with them by countering their every move, optimize over restarts. You can even bring in the government as long as you don't mention time travel. I'm sure with some money and influence (aka money) they'd be more than happy to bring an army to annihilate the necromancers island and defend the academy. 

    6- ???

    7- End the time loop buy a plot of land, revolutionize mind magic and other fields, have kids and become the most powerful mage that has ever lived at the tender (physical) age of 15. Take that Damien!

      >Focus the best researchers and every soul mage you can find on understanding the time loop and improving his own soul defense and attacks.

      If I were your Dungeon Master I’d make the first soul mage you hired that’s clever enough steal your looping ticket and get you a game over (maybe you’d like to continue playing as that soul mage?).

      Soul mages would be one of the few things that I’d expect a clever looper to stay as far away from as possible. No matter how much money you promise to a soul mage, once you clue him in to the whole looping business there’s a big chance he’ll take the best one shot he’s got at turning on you and stealing your ability — especially since you yourself aren’t a qualified soul mage and don’t understand how it works.

      Zorian’s chosen approach is almost entirely consistent with his personality. The only things that stand out are him not seeking better tutors (I think you’ll enjoy [Temporal Beacon,](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6517567) btw) and him not concentrating completely on the memory pack decryption. He could hire at least 2-3 different Aranea webs in a single loop, and so far he almost never even approached the one web that’s described as the best mind-reading professionals. I am guessing that the Doylist explanation for this is that once the decryption happens, some “game scripts” will get [triggered](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScriptedEvent) and the entire environment will get irreversibly changed, so the author is taking his time with the status quo while he can. The Watsonian explanation, however, makes Zorian look like an idiot in this regard.

      >.. tons of money .. richest man in the world .. Use that money .. Buy mercenaries .. Buy a big mercenary army .. money and .. (more money) 

      You’re severely overestimating how much money crystal-hunting can get him in a month’s time. Maybe if he robbed some rich people or made some kind of deal with them, he’d get himself an army-buying amount of money, but otherwise there isn’t much to do to get that rich in a mere month. Besides, even if he *did* have the money to buy an army, the logistics of assembling so much people together would also take more time then he can spend on it.

        Presumably you would have made the spiders take over his soul too if you were the dm...
        ```

        - u/OutOfNiceUsernames:
          ```
          (The spiders can’t do anything to his soul — only give him a brainwashing that’d last through loops.)

          They’d have two reasons for this: ether straight out betrayal (which did happen, and can be defended against by suicide), or when finding out about the loop and wanting in. In latter case it’s a matter of trust, and Zorian decided to trust his current spider partners since he was in a zeitnot because of the deteriorating mem-package and had no other solution.

          With the soul mages there is no such obvious zeitnot, so hiring them to research looping would be an *unnecessary* and serious risk.
          ```

          - u/RMcD94:
            ```
            Well the whole loop itself is a zeitnot. Of course I can simply say that Zorian way is obviously the right way because he will win at the end. 

            The memory package was from the spiders I am just saying that using your logic with the soul magic is that if the story hadn't gone into mind magic you would be saying any mind magic would be a mind rape and immediately enslave you. 

            Since both mind and soul magic imply knowledge of the loop before you know about the magic.
            ```

              > Of course I can simply say that Zorian way is obviously the right way because he will win at the end. 

              No, that wouldn't be a rational story anymore.

              > Since both mind and soul magic imply knowledge of the loop before you know about the magic. 

              No, both areas of magic expertise exist outside of the time loop.

              Yes, Zorian did take a risk with his current aranea partners because of the zeitnot. However, from a probabilistic POV, the more people Zorian meet that are capable of discovering the loop and manipulating his mind/soul, the greater his danger of coming across a treacherous party. That's why it's not a very good idea to meet/hire 2-3 aranea webs simultaneously as /u/OutOfNiceUsernames suggested. However, it can be necessitated by the urgency of the packet decaying, so it's up to the author how to deal with the risk.

      From the author.

      >I thought of all the exploits mentioned, but for most of them I have three basic complaints: 1. They trivialize the risks inherent in their proposals, claiming that Nothing Can Go Wrong and all risks can be mitigated (ha ha). 2. They ignore the set-up time needed to make some of the scenarios come to pass. Some things cannot be done in a month. Other can, but would take years of repetition until you could align everything just right, which is a dubious time investment. 3. A fair number of them depend on assumptions that just aren't true. The setting doesn't work that way. As an aside, a lot of proposals focus on recruit a lot of people for his projects. This is obviously a potent tactics, if fraught with its own issues, but consider this: if Zorian was the type of person who was inclined to do this, he would be already dead by this point in the story. He would have made himself noticeable within the first couple of restart and gotten soulkilled by Red Robe before he was capable of doing anything about it. The same reason that is limiting his growth is the only reason he is alive right now.
      ```

    - u/elevul:
      ```
      Keep in mind that the writer itself has admitted that it would be incredibly easy for Zorian to break everything by abusing the Time Loop, so he's putting limitations all around because that wouldn't make for a good story. Just think about the possibility of Zorian developing the mind magic to the point of directly downloading any skills and knowledge he needs from other peoples' minds...
      ```

      - u/Gurkenglas:
        ```
        No need for a time loop to do that. If it was possible, aranea would do it.
        ```

  - u/Xtraordinaire:
    ```
    Zorian definitely does not have infinite money, as he has to allot time to map the riches, and then harvest and convert resources into cash in every restart. Harvesting mana is not so great, but thankfully he can now just rob the aranean treasury for cash. The main argument against exploiting money is attention it would inadvertently get, and Zorian needs to remain unnoticed at all costs.

    There are, however, some instances where Zorian can use money to solve very concrete tasks that are already on his list: Silverlake's task and that mansion in the north. I think he could at least make an attempt with a bunch of mercenaries. Since Tavien is sort of in the time loop now, maybe he will finally make some progress there.
