## Introducing the new Weekly Challenge!

### Post:

I'll be running a weekly challenge, starting next week at this time. The rules have been pulled from /r/worldbuilding's weekly challenge, and I'll endeavor to run it like that one. The biggest difference is that this is **prose only.**

##### Standard Rules

* All genres welcome.

* Submission thread will be posted 7 days from now (Wednesday, 7PM ET, 4PM PT, 11PM GMT).

* 300 word minimum, no maximum.

* No plagiarism, but you're welcome to recycle and revamp your own ideas you've used in the past.

* Don't downvote unless an entry is trolling, spam, abusive, or breaks the no-plagiarism rule.

* Submission thread will be in "contest" mode.

* Winner will be determined by "best" sorting.

* Winner gets reddit gold, special winner flair, and bragging rights.

* One submission per account.

##### Meta

If you think you have a good prompt for a challenge, [add it to the list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B6HaZc8FYkr6l6Q4cwBc9_-Yq1g0f_HmdHK5L1tbEbA/edit?usp=sharing) (remember that [a good prompt is not a recipe](http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/prompts?src=RECIPE)). If you think that you have a good modification to the rules, let me know in a comment below. I can't promise that reddit gold will always be on offer, but it will for at least the first month.

##### Next Week

Next week's challenge is "Portal Fantasy". The Portal Fantasy is a common fantasy trope: a group of children get pulled into the magical world of Narnia; a girl follows a white rabbit through the looking glass; a tornado pulls a Kansas farmhouse up and plops it down in the land of Oz. In a rational story invoking this trope, what happens next? Keep in mind the characteristics of rational fiction listed in the sidebar.

**The submissions thread will go up 6/17, and the winner will be decided on 6/24.** (If you want my advice on how to win, and a preview of winner flair, [see here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/alexanderwales/comments/39cn2a/how_to_win_challenges_on_reddit_revisited/))

  Rational Portal Fantasy: Chell shoots one portal on the ground, one very carefully aimed at Mount Doom, and Frodo drops the ring in. GLaDOSauron explodes.

  I don't see a prompt for this week am I not supposed to see a prompt this week? I wanted to see a prompt this week SO MUCH FOR THESE NEW MODS HUH GUYS
  ```

    There's a prompt for next week, which is "Portal Fantasy". Prompts will always be given a week in advance. So when the submissions thread for "Portal Fantasy" comes there will be a section at the bottom of the post that tells you what the prompt is for the week after.

    * This week (6/10): prompt given for Portal Fantasy
    * Next week (6/17): submissions thread for Portal Fantasy, also Prompt X given
    * Week after that (6/24): winner declared for Portal Fantasy, submissions thread for Prompt X, also Prompt Y given
    * Week after that (7/1): winner declared for Prompt X, submissions thread for Prompt Y, also Prompt Z given

    It's done like that mostly to give you time to get writing *now*, and to cut away some of the benefits of just being the first one to see the thread and push something out fast (so hopefully you spend *tonight* writing up your Portal Fantasy and have it ready for next week, giving better content than something just dashed off in the spur of the moment). Of course, you're free to dash something off in the spur of the moment a week from now if you really want.

    Edit: That also allows for this to be a meta thread, in case there are any glaring errors in the setup, questions, comments, clarifications, or things of that nature.

      I understand this prompt-ahead-of-time is because your guide explicitly mentions that being early is an advantage. This procedure still is an advantage for being in the right timezone/sleep rhythm.

      I guess to counter that over time, the submission thread could be posted at some random time within a 24 hour range.
      ```

      - u/alexanderwales:
        ```
        Timing is always going to be a (minor) problem. There are a couple solutions that negate it entirely; for example, it would be possible to set up a bot that you can submit to at any time during the week that's set to disgorge all of the submissions into the submission thread the moment it goes live. Alternately, I could try to write some open-source script so that people can make their own bots that poll for "[Weekly Challenge]" in the title.

        For now, I think contest mode negates the majority of the benefits of posting first, and having the threads go up at a set, predictable time means that no one has to be refreshing the page throughout the day, and (ideally) means that submission can be something that you do during a five minute break from work, or from your phone. If you *really* want that minor edge and the thread goes up when you're sleeping, you can set an alarm on your phone, wake up for the handful of minutes it takes to post what you've written, then go back to bed. That's not a perfect solution, but the alternative seems to be that the thread would go up while you're sleeping and you wouldn't know about it until you woke up.

        I'll watch this first challenge closely though, and try to get some sense of how much impact timing *actually* has; after the fact it will be possible to grab all the timestamps and scores and see what the correlation is.

        (We'll also have to see how many submissions we get; if it's three, then trying to totally level the playing field is probably not worth it.)

  Ahahaha. I'm actually working on a rational Portal Fantasy story right now. 

  Hm... I guess I can test drive it and see what y'all think. Well, part of it, anyway (the whole thing will be around 400,000 words, so there's no way I'm writing all that in a week!).
  ```

- u/None:

  /u/alexanderwales; It is a pain to scroll past every entry every time a new comment is posted to see if that comment was a new entry.

  Suggestions:

  * Have entrants make one top level comment (perhaps with a title, word count, optional short description), and submit their entry as a reply to that comment. All voting should be done on the top level comment. This makes it many times easier to sort through posts and see if anything new has been posted, while not affecting much else. It would also allow longer entries, as the author could post multiple numbered replies under the same top level comment. 

  * Create a second thread for discussion of entries. No comments should be posted in the contest thread unless they are entries (this isn't as necessary if you go the first route, but still useful).
  ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    I would *suggest* that you install [Reddit Enhancement Suite](http://redditenhancementsuite.com/), which (among other things) has a feature called "Comment Hide Persistor" which will make it so that every comment you minimize (using the minus symbol next to the voting buttons) will stay minimized the next time you visit the thread. It took me some time to realize that this wasn't default reddit behavior. By collapsing every top-level comment that you've read, the only expanded ones should be ones that you haven't seen before.

    Let me know if that works as a solution for you. (I understand it doesn't do much if you can't install RES, if you're using AlienBlue or RedditIsFun.) It's possible that I'll just decide to switch over to top-level comments being a link to Google Docs or off-site, which is what /r/fantasywriters does, but that would be the week after next, as the rules have already been posted for next week.

    (If anyone else is having issues with this, let me know so I can see how much of a problem this is.)

  So what's the deal with people posting their contest entries to the /r/rational main page? It seems like it confers a huge advantage over people who don't so it kind of forces people who want to win to post as well. Plus people who are good at redditing (e.g. they know what times of day to post and other techniques like that) get additional advantage. Should it just be a given that you post both to the thread and to the main? Doesn't this have some of the downsides that the random contest mode is meant to avoid? Also it raises questions like how much are we allowed to market our stories? Is it ok to post it in other subreddits? Other websites? It just feels kind of inelegant but maybe I'm just being neurotic. There definitely are some benefits: it encourages more discussion, provides more content for /r/rational, and increases overall visibility to those who don't want to dig through the contest thread. On the other hand those benefits would still mostly be there if the stories were posted after the competition

  There might also be an issue with clutter on the main page, but I think that's either minor or even a positive.
  ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    Blegh.

    That's mostly how I feel about it.

    The *intent* of the challenge is to have a fun community thing, with the secondary effect of stimulating people to create rational fiction. This works well in a number of other subs, who have rules that are substantially similar to what we use, and those subs have substantially larger contests with more entries.

    The challenge is not meant to be about marketing, or about gaming the system, and what rules there are (those which aren't just clarifications or common sense) exist in order to reduce those advantages.

    So ... yes, there are definite advantages that are conferred by posting your story in this subreddit, or by advertising it elsewhere, like on your personal website, your blog, Facebook, or whatever. There is a strong possibility that this will make the contest more about marketing than actual writing skill, which is not at all what I want, because it then pushes out people who know they can't win a war fought with marketing. (There are benefits to marketing, such as growing the subreddit and increasing exposure to rational fiction.)

    On the other hand, I totally get the impulse to share what you've written with as wide an audience as possible. I get how it might feel stifling to have this awesome story you've written consigned to contest mode in the weekly challenge thread. If your primary motivation in writing is to get your writing read, why chose to write for a contest that's going to limit that exposure? If we implemented perfectly anonymous posting and strict rules on cross-posting, I would expect participation to drop. I would expect that if *I* were thinking of writing for that contest, I would be less inclined.

    And no, I don't want the front page clogged with people making duplicates of their entry, though we've only got five entries right now, so ... that's not really that much of a concern.

    I'm disinclined to making rule changes, just on principle (well, also because there are frictional costs associated with doing so). And we've only got 1.5 challenges as our sample size, with the first being won by someone who opted *not* to post elsewhere, for whatever reason. I would prefer for there to just be a community understanding, but doubt that's going to happen. So far, there has not been a real problem.

    /u/farmerbob1, thoughts?
    ```

    - u/Farmerbob1:
      ```
      If we want to make it only in the contest thread, that's fine by me.  I think it would best to start it for the next contest though.
      ```

      - u/alexanderwales:
        ```
        I will probably add it to the rules, more as a strong suggestion than something anyone is going to get policed for. It's a balance of incentives thing; I don't want people to be unable to share a cool thing they made with a wider audience, but I also don't want people to think that there's something unfair going on, or that there's a need to compete on some level other than writing.

        (Posting to /r/rational after the contest is over is probably my preference? I do really like "A Man and His Dog", and obviously it's the sort of thing that /r/rational enjoys, and I think it's good to post to the main subreddit, because people might otherwise miss it.)

  u/alexanderwales: (I don't know if you bother checking this regularly...)

  I am concerned that the cash rewards are not really helping to the extent I hoped for. Only 2.something data points, but the trend is worrying. At least, there doesn't seem to be any strong effect on quality or quantity of submissions due to the reward. For certain, the first contest's hype was enough to overcome any effect it might have.

  I actually predicted this in the other thread where we were discussing competitions and cash rewards -- in hindsight I probably shouldn't have deleted that post (I just did not want to be the naysayer...)

  My mental model anticipates a long stream of short contests with small rewards won't entice many new people to join in. The flair + bragging rights is sufficient to push most people who would participate to do so; there aren't many people who would not participate for that, but who would if you added a chance of a small monetary reward. Also, anyone entering is already going to put forth their best effort in the time they feel like allotting. Again, an additional chance at a small monetary reward isn't going to have much effect on their level of effort or the time spent.

  In my previous post, I mentioned how I did not believe that many smaller competitions would have much effect on participation or on bringing in new people to the sub. It certainly should (and does!) result in the creation of interesting stories, and in motivating more existing members to write. That is a great thing, and I am very much in favor.

  I do believe, however, that regarding resource expenditure, our interests are best served in increasing exposure to rational fiction and in getting *more* people interested. If the goal is more and better quality works, this is limited by the 1% rule. You can only entice existing members to contribute so much, but there is a long, long ways to go before you hit diminishing returns on resources put towards growing the member base.

  My mental model anticipates that any monetary rewards can used more effectively by one large competition with a longer timespan, multiple substantial rewards, and lots of hype. Either that, or advertising.

  As I stated before, ultimately I trust your discretion. I think this is something to consider at least.

  Edit: tagging u/amitpamin since he also has a stake in this.

    > My mental model anticipates that any monetary rewards can used more effectively by one large competition with a longer timespan, multiple substantial rewards, and lots of hype. Either that, or advertising.

    I think I generally agree. Next week's challenge ("Ever After") will then be the last challenge to offer a cash reward, but that brings the question of what to do with the money.

    * If we do a "big" challenge with it, we'll have to figure out some rules, and I don't know the best way to structure it. Longer word count minimum, for one thing. Probably not decided by upvotes or downvotes, which are easy to game, and which might not produce good results if lots of people are coming in from outside. Panel of judges willing to read lots of entries?
    * If we do advertising, we'll have to figure out the best way to do that. I'll talk to my wife about it; she works for an SEO company. If you want to advertise within reddit specifically, we could put up ads for a contest targeted against most of the larger writing subreddits (/r/writing, /r/WritingPrompts, etc.). Or I can talk to some of the mods there. (We also need to get a submission for /r/subredditads. And probably talk to what I see as a spiritual sister-sub in /r/AskScienceFiction.)

    I'll do some more thinking on it over the weekend, and talk to my wife (and some of her coworkers) about advertising, click-through-rates, and all that sort of stuff. In the meantime, let me know your thoughts.

- u/MugaSofer:
  ```
  I think it would be a good idea to have a meta thread each week - even if it was only a comment on the main thread - rather than directing everyone here. If nothing else, it would let us discuss the different prompts and maybe improve them over time.
  ```

- u/xamueljones:
  ```
  That's awesome! Congrats on being a mod and I'll definitely submit something for the first week at least.

  I'm curious, what were the requirements for being a mod on this subreddit? Or basically what behaviour did you have to demonstrate to be accepted?
  ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    I just asked. There's not a formal process in place, and there aren't really that many mod duties on a sub of this size (no real harassment, no real need for an iron fist, not that many things getting caught in the spam filter). The only thing that I really anticipate doing with mod powers is running this contest. If I had to list qualities that I think a mod should have ... don't get in heated arguments with people, try your best to be helpful and nice, show some initiative from time to time?
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      Basically, I inherited it from /u/seraphbnb, and added /u/PeridexisErrant because he/she/ve (I honestly don't know) seemed like a level-headed and helpful person who's interested in the subject.

      And you seem like the most active participant on the sub, so you're pretty damn well-qualified.
      ```

      - u/PeridexisErrant:
        ```
        (He) 

        Basically AlexanderWales was clearly going to use the power for good not evil, and had some fairly detailed ideas that needed a mod to implement. 

        We don't do all that much here to be honest, compared to /r/DwarfFortress.
        ```
