## [MK] Give Directions

### Post:

Another hypothetical, as I have evidently gained a habit of posing. This one less mystical, and more "what can you do by breaking a particular physical law in half over your knee."

What would you do, given the ability to create and collapse direction bubbles?

Direction bubbles are spheres which remain stationary relative to your reference frame ('yours' being the average of your constituents, if you happen to be in the unfortunate situation of different parts of your body have significantly different frames), of a radius you specify when you create them, which impel particles inside of them to move in a direction you specify when you create the bubble. This impulse converts heat into uniform aligned kinetic energy, at a rate per second between but not including zero and one which you specify when you create the bubble. Creating and collapsing a bubble only requires the barest thought, and specifications for radius, direction, and rate can be thought of beforehand and saved for later. You may create a bubble centered on any point you see. It's creation will begin on a light-like interval from the end of your thought, and will expand to your specified radius at c. Collapsing a bubble also begins on a light-like interval from the end of your thought, and the sphere likewise recedes to its center at c.

You are the only person able do this. Elsewhere on Earth, there is a direction antibubble creator, who can create and collapse bubbles that are identical to yours, except that they convert uniform kinetic energy moving in the specified direction of the bubble.

When you or your opposite die, the other obtains their opposite's ability.

  This is another of those powers where incautious testing could destroy a planet.  Yay c minus elipson particle cannons!

  Unfortunately, this one could get the rest of the solar system too.  If your counterpart doesn't collapse the bubble before she too dies, the bubble (centred on the far-flung atoms that once made up your body) will become a wandering star-killer.

  Unless you specified a radius of billions of lightyears, in which the universe as we know it ceases to exist.

  The inverse power is also dangerous - it could create a zone where the heat death of the universe comes early.  Game over.

    It seems like it conserves energy, but not momentum, so you get an ice cannon. I would assume there's got to be limits on the size of the bubble as well.

  They have a conversion process whose input is "uniform kinetic energy moving in the specified direction" and whose output is *what*? Heat? So you fire a bullet at the bubble and it gets warm, while the bullet stops? But only if the bullet's aimed in a specific direction relative to the person?

  Build a liquid nitrogen cannon.  

  Set up a sphere in the atmosphere that has its heat-sucking set to maximum, and aim it forward.  It will rapidly cool the air, hopefully enough to liquefy it, and shoot it out the front.  This creates a vacuum in the bubble, drawing in more air, and continuing the process.
