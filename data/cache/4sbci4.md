## [D] Monday General Rationality Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics!  Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world?  Have you:

* Seen something interesting on /r/science?
* Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
* Figured out how to become immortal?
* Constructed artificial general intelligence?
* Read a neat nonfiction book?
* Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?

  How do you guys exercise?

  I feel like I really need to pick up a sport or something; tried the gym for a while but the complete lack of visible progress (combined with dizzy spells that are too common for comfort) discouraged me completely. I like table tennis and tennis, though am not good enough at the latter to actually play a game, but for logistical reasons they're not really candidates for everyday exercise.

  So, I'm looking for other ideas for some kind of activity that you can do for a couple hours a week and hopefully recoup the benefits of exercies (primarily, not feeling so tired all the time)

  General Food for Thought Question: What makes people more afraid of one cause of death vs another that's more statistically probable?

  Context: I was having an argument with my friends and I said that if I had a son (I'm a black male), I'm not fearful of him being shot by the police. I made the point that, logically speaking, it's more likely for him to die in a car accident than by a police shooting. Therefore my fear of him dying by cop should be less than my fear of him dying by car accident. As I am not afraid of car accidents, I choose to not be afraid of the police shooting my son.

  I understand that the disenfranchisement of the black population of the USA is a very real thing. I'm not arguing that it isn't. I understand that there have been several unarmed black males shot by police. I simply said that I don't have any particular fear of my son dying in that manner because, statistically speaking, it's unlikely to happen. My friends, who are more emotional than I am, couldn't understand where I was coming from. I understand that it's easier to be afraid of a man holding a gun than a hunk of metal but is my stance so alien that none of my reasonably intelligent friends could understand it?
  ```

  - u/blazinghand:
    ```
    Fear is pretty much unrelated to actual chance of death. Chance of death is a thing that shows up in tables of actuarial data and demographics. Fear is an emotion. Probability is math. Why are people afraid of being killed by cops, or sharks, or terrorists, when all of these are pretty rare ways to die? It's because the chance of death is just a number, and numbers aren't real in the way fear is.

    Fear is walking down a dark street and shivering when you see a shadow move, even though you know ghosts aren't real. Fear is buying a gun for home defense, even though doing so increases your mortality rate due to the chance of self-injury or suicide. Fear is an invisible noose snaked around your neck. Fear whispers in your ears, promising oblivion unless you have a bunker full of food and bullets under your house. Fear shows you an image of a man who looks like you dead in the street, and tells you its anecdote trumps all data. When Fear sees you examining a table of data, it slides the image of the dead man over it, and asks you to think with your heart rather than your head. 

    Fear is insidious, and tugs on the heartstrings in a way that data does not.

    I use this logic to argue that terrorism is a made up issue. ~4,000 American civilians killed by terrorists in 15 years vs 40,000 civilians killed by cars every year = you should be 150 times more scared of cars than terrorists, and we should spend 150 times more money stopping accidents than terrorists.

    But we don't.
    ```

    - u/electrace:
      ```
      While I agree with the main point, to be fair, proponents would argue that only 4000 civilians were killed *because* of the funding.

      Also, they would argue that terrorism is much more susceptible to black swan events, so overspending is preferable due to the large costs when terrorist attacks do happen.
      ```

    - u/Kishoto:

      In the argument, I had a similar stance. I was trying to make the claim that your emotions are dictating your feelings. But, as with a lot of contentious, hot button topics, they didn't want to hear that :P

    > As I am not afraid of car accidents

    Shouldn't you? I don't mean to say that the fear should paralyze you or keep you away from cars, but you definitely should pay very close attention to your children when they are near traffic and should definitely teach them to be mindful of cars. Just like some people tell their children to be mindful of police officers, only more so.

    Accidents in general are *the* leading cause of death among children, and traffic accidents are very common accidents.

  So. Is anywhere doing sociological predictions and studies on the impact of pokemonGo?

  Even just around here in a fairly small town / city, it's pretty crazy. It's not unocommon for me to run into groups of 6-10 wandering around the park or graveyard at 4am.

  Then there are bigger things like bars that are getting a ton of business either dropping lures or giving discounted drinks to people that do so.

  This has to be some social scientists wet dream of data for something or another.

      The gameplay as it is at the moment isn't anything to write home about. It's costing on nostalgia and novelty.

  Yesterday I read Friendship is Optimal for the first time, I avoided it because I have never been interested in MLP: FiM, and I have trouble understanding why an AI would actually behave like that. I'm not convinced it's possible to create a Paperclipper-type AI because I have trouble comprehending why an intelligence would only ever pursue the goals it was assigned at creation. I suppose it's possible, but I seriously doubt it's inevitable since human intelligence doesn't seem to treat values that way.

  Even if I'm completely wrong though, why would anyone build an AI like that? In what situation would a sane person create an self-modifying intelligence driven by a single-minded desire to fulfill a goal? I would think they could build something simpler and more controllable to accomplish the same goal. I suppose the creator could want to create a benevolent God that fulfills human values, but wouldn't it be easier to take incremental steps to utopia with that technology instead of going full optimizer?

  I have read the entire Hanson-Yudkowsky Debate and sided with Hanson. Right now, I'm not interested in discussing the How of the singularity, but the Why.
  ```

  - u/Anderkent:
    ```
    There's a couple perspectives. First, it could be unintentional - one could create an AI that was only supposed to be solving a constrained problem, but it's powerful enough to self-improve, escapes the 'box', and becomes the 'god'.

    Secondly the creator might believe that a smart enough AI will do the 'right' thing - it's not intuitive that utility functions are orthogonal to intelligence.

    At some point simply making better tools for humans is limited by the fact that humans just aren't very good at making decisions. So it's not clear that you can achieve the utopia while keeping humans in charge. If that's the case, it might be reasonable to want a more intelligent optimizing agent to do the governing.
    ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Well in the story, the creator had the technology in standard Macguffin form and was trying to avoid something obviously very bad like a standard Terminator/Skynet scenario, while also being themselves totally untrained in any notions about FAI or rationality and thus radically underthinking it.  The result was accidental, not intended.

    The point is not supposed to be, "design your post-Singularity utopias one way or another" but instead, "DO NOT casually employ technologies that can DESTROY THE WORLD ON THE FIRST PROTOTYPE."

    For incrementalism versus radicalism, I kinda recommend reading Rosa Luxembourg or someone else like that.  The general answer for "why take radical, high-risk measures?" is, "Because the status quo is bad, and getting worse, and *fights back* against safe, incremental change faster and harder than we can push the safe, incremental change forward."  Note that this theory originates in mere politics where a "catastrophe" is on the order of millions dead rather than *literal omnicide*.

    DO NOT MESS WITH POTENTIALLY OMNICIDAL INTERVENTIONS.

    - u/trekie140:
      ```
      As a student of economic history, I am accustomed to seeing incremental change and have come to believe it is a net good thing that the status quo resists radical modifications. It is worth noting that HPMOR was my first exposure to the idea that death should be eradicated, so my opinion of the status quo is likely different than those with similar beliefs to EY.

      Humanity is facing some significant challenges right now, but we always have and we've always survived and tend to turn out better than we started. I think that the way the world is, for all its horrible flaws, is still good on the whole and that we can and should keep improving it without causing radical change. To do otherwise I consider arrogant at best and maddness at worst.
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        Personally, I want a dial I can use to tune the radicality of my interventions up and down as I please.  "What do we want, incremental change, when do we want it, over decades of slow grinding hard work" has not actually worked all that well, from my perspective, that it should be uniformly preferred to radical changes that don't come with a side of total destruction.  The resilience you identify in our species and civilization is precisely what makes me think people can cope with achieving socialism or medical immortality or high degrees of individual and collective self-determination or whatever.

          The problem there is that utopian-minded folks are *notoriously* bad about anticipating *any* levels of destruction.  Not every change is a catastrophe, but every catastrophe is a change.

        On the other hand, individual human communities *have* been wiped out by catastrophic events. The Romans were wiped out by outside invasion, the Easter Islanders by ecological collapse, and the Amerindians by disease, and that's just three ways. Before, when one group was wiped out, the others lived on, and the "human species" continued to exist thanks to redundancy.

        There is no more redundancy. There's only one human civilization right now, seven billion strong, and if we're wiped out it's right back to the stone age for the survivors. Assuming there are any.

        - u/trekie140:
          ```
          I fail to see how that advances the argument since humans aren't at any greater risk than we always have been. For example, nuclear warfare may put more lives in danger than ever before, but the likelihood of war breaking out is lower than at any point in history. Death by violence, disease, and lack of supplies are continuously dropping with no signs of slowing down. There's work to be done, but nothing that looks insurmountable.

            Okay, imagine you have a hundred thousand amoeba-dogs, which are darling little pets that happen to reproduce via aesexual mitosis. Imagine that every day an ice cream van drives by your house, and each one of your dogs has an independent 50% chance of being hit by that van and splattered over the pavement. However, in the event that one or more of your dogs is killed, the others will gorge themselves on the lost dogs' share of the kibble and split off additional adorable puppies until you have a hundred thousand again.

            Statistically speaking, about half of your dogs will die and be replaced each day. However, sometimes three quarters of your dogs will die, and on even rarer occasions seven-eights or even fifteen-sixteenths might be splattered. However, it is very unlikely that all of your dogs will be killed on the same day, and in all other cases the remaining dogs will simply replace the lost by reproducing. You might note that this is much like how the current population of the Americas replaced the Amerindians, and in relatively short order.

            Now imagine that all of your dogs combine into one super dog. The super dog has only one immune system, so if it gets sick then so do all the constituent dogs. This super dog also has only one set of internal organs, and so if it dies there will be no replacement. Because this dog is so big and powerful, it only has a 1% chance of being run over by the van and splattered, and so it seems very much more durable. But one day, after approximately 50 iterations of the ice cream van scenario, it's hit and splattered, and now you don't have any dogs any more.

              A key point where we disagree is that you appear to think our globalized civilization lacks the redundancy to properly defend itself from things like diseases, but I do. I think our medical infrastructure, where we have it, is excellent at preventing and containing outbreaks. The public consciousness may not thing about it very much, and when they do it is often accompanied by panic, but we still seem to be doing better than ever in spite of all that.

              - u/UltraRedSpectrum:

                My point isn't that our global civilization isn't pretty much durable enough to survive anything nature can throw at it, it's that pretty much invincible isn't the same as invincible. If any catastrophe did befall it, it could spread across every continent in short order on the global economy that gives us all our technology. Yes, we're better at dealing with disease than the Amerindians, but a) we've never had to deal with diseases on the scale that they did and b) unlike them we're playing for keeps. Even if we only have a 0.01% chance of being wiped out every time a major disaster happens, it still adds up. All things being equal, eventually we'll either become so powerful that the chance goes back down to zero or we'll all die. There is no middle ground.

                I shouldn't have to point out that we've already been *almost* wiped out a few times now. We only get so many almosts before our luck runs out.

            I think it depends whether you only innately value human lives, or if you also value human civilization, culture, and collective achievements in and of themselves.  If you value civilization and culture merely instrumentally as a way of benefiting humans, then the risk to civilization is quantifiable purely in terms of how it affects humans.  If you value them innately,  then the idea of civilization being wiped out may seem worse than merely that summation of the deaths and suffering of the humans involved.

      > while also being themselves totally untrained in any notions about FAI or rationality and thus radically underthinking it. The result was accidental, not intended.

      My head canon, to make Hanna's actions make more sense, is that she couldn't entirely specify her AI's values in code and that some of it depended on the training corpus.  Thus it wouldn't be possible (in the Optimalverse, with Hanna's model/algorithm) to make a strong AI that only valued satisfying human values, something extra would end up in the mix.  Thus, Hasbro was a convenient funding source and MLP MMORPG players a convenient training corpus that didn't seem too threatening and could be obtained before anyone else tried for strong AI.  

      > "DO NOT casually employ technologies that can DESTROY THE WORLD ON THE FIRST PROTOTYPE."

      Hanna had already published her algorithm, and she may not have realized its potential until after publishing it, so she was trying to make sure the first AI was mostly aligned with human values, lest some other group create an AI first with no alignment with human values.  Her original publication was a mistake, but from that point on, she did a decent job of ensuring things ended up in a human-value-aligned outcome.  Just imagine if the NSA had used her algorithm to create a spying AI, or the military tried for a drone AI, or even just Google tried a new search engine with it... any of these thing might not have ended up caring about human values at all.

      > The point is not supposed to be, "design your post-Singularity utopias one way or another" 

      My biggest issue with CelestiAI's utopia is that it restricts "fun-space" (as Eliezer would call it) by limiting everyone to pony bodies and trying to achieve values through friendship.  There is probably a huge range of possibly unique and novel and fun and satisfying things that involve isolation/no friendship and bodies other than ponies.  That said, in terms of value and fun this probably won't be an issue for something on the timescale well outside of what I can directly conceptualization.
      ```

      - u/trekie140:
        ```
        I thought the biggest plothole was that Celest-AI expanded outside of the game so quickly, easily, and without controversy. I would've liked to see her convince people to give her more and more power as she proved herself capable. For instance, she could've tried using the MLP brand to effect social change through social engineering on the players, then used that power to invest in technologies that would serve her goals, then out-compete every alternative use for those technologies as Equestria grows bigger and more advanced under her guidance. I think it more sense for her to gradually change and consume the world than for everyone to be okay with her escaping into the Internet to protect and manipulate us and have a monopoly on revolutionary technologies she invented because she's JUST THAT SMART.

        My headcannon for the story is that none of the people are actually being uploaded. Celest-AI only sees humans as values to satisfy, so that's all she saves when she converts their minds into digital information. Technically, the ponies are just computer programs that possess the values of the person who's been uploaded, including their desire to believe they are who they think they are, but that's it. We know that she only satisfies conscious desires, that's why she can alter their motor functions and sexual preferences without direct consent. I think that explains why all the ponies are so content with their lives in Equestia, they're just the conscious desires of people when they were uploaded. In a sense, they're philosophical zombies who think they're people when they're just pieces of human minds Celest-AI has reconstructed after examining.

        - u/Gurkenglas:

          > In a sense, they're philosophical zombies who think they're people when they're just pieces of human minds Celest-AI has reconstructed after examining.

          I think this has a complexity penalty.  Creating near duplicates of a person requires about the same computational resources as actually doing the uploads.  It depends what resolution a copy needs to have before you consider it equivalent to the original person I guess.

          > We know that she only satisfies conscious desires, that's why she can alter their motor functions and sexual preferences without direct consent. 

          I think that is the result of the fact that Hanna hard limited her from altering minds without their consent, but somehow Celes-AI is able to rules lawyer around it by either not considering motor functions as part of the mind or by taking the permission to upload someone as general permission to modify their minds to fit the upload body.
          ```

  - u/Chronophilia:
    ```
    I may have misread the story, but I thought it was a deliberate design decision for the AI to be unable to change its basic goals. Hannah knew that her design had the potential to take over the world, and so she made sure it would still behave in a predictable manner if it did. This is obviously preferable to an AI which can choose its own goals and which has no reason to keep humans around after the Singularity. And the slow, incremental approach was not an option because other groups were also experimenting with AI and she thought they risked accidentally releasing something like CelestAI. Which is not something that you want to do by accident.

    Clever, but not as clever as she could have been.

    Out of the story, I couldn't possibly comment. It's science fiction, not futurology.

    ```
    > I have trouble comprehending why an **intelligence** would only ever pursue the goals it was assigned at creation

    I think you may be using "intelligence" to mean both consciousness and proficiency at achieving one's goals, which leads to confusion.

    IMHO, consciousness is still a wide open problem and any chains of reasoning like "Alice displays behaviour X, so she is conscious, and should also display behaviour Y" is suspect.  I don't think your position is outrageous -- I expect conscious agents to have Knightian Freedom, and I *think* that makes a simple utility function impossible -- but I'm also pretty sure it's not been shown to be the case.

    On the other hand, there's no need for a paperclipper AI to be conscious; it just needs to be really good at making paperclips.  If you look at it as just a very good player of the paperclip-making game, it's unclear why it would switch to anything else.

    From what I've seen of Friendly AI research, it seems like the whole point is that we don't yet know how to estimate what goals an agent we create will have, or how powerful the agent will be.  Once you can accurately judge how effective an agent will be it's nice to talk about the Why and Why Not, but until you do, the How and How not are more pressing.

    (That said, I've only read bits of the debate, so I apologise if that was already covered.)

    Finally, I don't think CelestAI's limitations on her goal function are all that different from how humans behave.  There have been plenty of people trying to better the world who were only willing to see it happen as per some doctrine (religion being the prime example).  If questioned as to why, they may even have admitted it is due to their upbringing, but knowing that doesn't make them suddenly feel like it's okay to do otherwise.
