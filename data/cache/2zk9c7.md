  THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT

  yes. that was exactly what this story needed. that was a satisfying ending.

  I've had this kicking around for a while and decided I should finally publish it.

  /u/bulls55, this doesn't invalidate anything you're doing with Reigns End.

    ...What?

      Most of the world is above or below the surface.

        -of-9s% is a really weird way to say that though.. Where is that... nomenclature(?) from?
        ```

          ```
          Oh bloody goddamn hell. Screw you, FFN!

          That originally said "99.lots-of-9s%" and stupid FFN's link eater ate it. 

          Okay, fixed.

    Thank you.   I was wondering if you were going to stick to Jake getting assassinated or not. . . this is better.
    ```

    - u/eaglejarl:
      ```
      Nah, he was never going to be assassinated.  The idea was always that he would figure out what was coming and then find some clever way out of it.
      ```

- u/Gurkenglas:
  ```
  Please tell me Jake didn't forget to add a "Cast a Wish using the words on the piece of paper given to it" Gnome.
  ```

  - u/eaglejarl:
    ```
    The little 1-Int-1000-UMD things will cast a Wish for you.
    ```

    - u/Chronophilia:
      ```
      Ah, so he's got a few Scrolls of Wish in his inventory?
      ```

      - u/eaglejarl:
        ```
        Oh, heck yeah. Remember how he was strewing piles of them around the street, free for the taking? Yeah, he brought a whole bunch with him n
        ```

  - u/JackStargazer:
    ```
    He doesn't really need to.

    Really, all he needed was a ring of three wishes. Without Gods in our world there is nobody to stop him from getting into an infinite wish loop.
    ```

- u/Mraedis:
  ```
  It's a little shorter than I'd liked, but it's a damn good ending anyway. Well done!
  ```

- u/clawclawbite:
  ```
  Its magical gnome golems all the way down...

  Y'know, if they're worried about Jake raising an army, then why let him have all of those magic items? Was him bringing that HH a condition of the bombs not going off?

  >Anyway. The plan was too complicated by half, but it worked. A month before I was going to be executed, I went to the Archmagi and told them that, unless they sent me home, each of my two thousand spell engines was going to go off and Polymorph Any Object a pebble into a cubic meter of antimatter neutronium. Then, of course, I had to explain what neutronium is, which took a while. Anyway. Moving on.

  I wish I could have been a fly on the wall in that conversation.

  ```
  When Jake was filling his backpack did he toss in just any magic item he could find or were there any items he refused to bring with him due to being too dangerous? Also how are they(as in the governments) going to handle any wish scrolls that were brought over? Can you imagine what would happen if some omnicidal lunatic got his hands on a wish scroll then decided to cause as much damage as possible, made even worse if he has an internet connection or is an experienced and creative D&D player. Loved the ending by the way and looking foward to reading your future works.
  ```

  - u/eaglejarl:
    ```
    Jake's...not the most forethoughtful guy.  His strategy for putting things in the pack was "sure, why not?"  Hopefully he's got the brains -- or he used someone as an advisor who DOES have the brains -- to remove the really dangerous stuff before handing it out.
    ```

    - u/Kishoto:
      ```
      Personally, I kinda feel like the wish scrolls should've been left behind in that case. Unless he's planning some hard-core regulation, and has a way to say "Fuck Off" to every major world government and organization as well, once his claims are proven valid, and the wish scrolls are proven valid, I feel like any number of agencies will hunt him down to obtain them. Even if it's just to lock them away so that no one else can use them either. I get that some people will argue that they can do just as much good as bad, but rational statistics aren't always correct. It only takes one fucked up wish to wipe out all life in our universe, even if that wasn't its original intent.

  Not the Copenhagen model, the Many Worlds model.
