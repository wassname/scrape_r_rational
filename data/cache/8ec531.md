## [D] Monday General Rationality Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics!  Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world?  Have you:

* Seen something interesting on /r/science?
* Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
* Figured out how to become immortal?
* Constructed artificial general intelligence?
* Read a neat nonfiction book?

  It might be of interest to point out that the HBO show Silicon Valley has touched on Roko's Basilisk for the past couple of weeks, and the most recent episode has what seems to be an actual AGI.

      Irrational market-driven social-network-addicted humans with inane attention spans look like they're actually far more likely to do something like that than super-intelligent, hyper-rational AIs.

  I've been feeling pretty good lately, to the point where I've noticed how little I'm thinking about things that caused me so much anxiety and depression. Part of me is concerned about that, though, because I had rationalized my self-loathing with self-awareness of how privileged I am as a middle-class white person. 

  When I was afraid of becoming impoverished I started to feel empathy towards people who live in poverty that I had never thought about before, which meant the pain I felt was nothing compared to what so many others had gone through and my utilitarian self-righteousness compelled me to think about that pain all the time. 

  I was on the verge of becoming a Marxist because I saw all the ways the system causes suffering and all the ways I had enabled it without realizing. However, now that I have regained the privilege of financial security, I find I no longer hate capitalism. I feel comfortable where I once felt ashamed and am not insecure about how that comfort in the status quo enables suffering.

  I feel the same way about basically every political issue, I have the privilege to not need to care about being abused by the system and I prefer not caring because caring was painful. I still support causes that reduce suffering, but now I feel like I do it more out of group loyalty than empathy. I don't think this is the way my morals should work if I want to be virtuous.

  I'm thinking the way I did when I was younger, where everyone can get along just be deciding to be nice, which I had concluded was naive. Nothing has changed my mind about how culture has instilled prejudices and biases that enable discrimination and abuse, even among those with privilege who think they're helping because they don't really understand the disadvantaged.

  The status quo is still a horrifically unjust state of affairs where suffering happens all the time and I believe everyone is culpable for allowing that to occur, but I'm not very concerned about it. I'm happy in my corner of the world and don't want to jeopardize that by worrying about systemic injustice. Feeling constant anxiety isn't healthy or virtuous, but shouldn't I want to help more than I do?

    **So TL;DR, I offer a re-interpretation of the golden rule: “Where possible, act as though your life followed the rules of your ideal society. Slowly, over time, this will build the society you’re picturing.”**

    Oof, you just described my struggles with my first depressive episode. I realized that I was coming out of that state because I noticed myself thinking hard about the same issues that I felt were characterizing my depression but without the all-consuming existential despair that I associated with them. The depression made these issues so very urgent for me because, through my (comparatively mild) suffering, I felt connected to humanity's collective suffering. 

    If you still believe that the status quo is a horrifically unjust equilibrium, then I hope we still agree that changing it is important. In my process, I have had to make peace with the fact that I don’t have access to the entirety of the system, and I can’t change what I don’t have access to. At the same time, however, I have started to think of how to subvert the system to make it behave more compassionately at every scale that I have access to. 

    For example, at an individual scale, I tidy up more often than before, and I clean even when it’s not my personal responsibility. As I do this, I have to consciously remind myself that I can’t actually change people’s opinions on this, but that by simply cleaning up more often, people will notice that it’s nice to live in a cleaner world and see that it’s easier if we all help. I think social systems are self-replicating, and that each system’s rules imprint on and pervade every individual and action in that system. Consciously acting in ways that subvert the negative rules and outcomes of our current social systems is, for me, a way of slowly building systems in which the rules are compassionate, rather than punitive; generous, rather than greedy. I think all of this sounds obvious in hindsight, but I also think that this framing has been more helpful to me than any other discussion about personal and social change I’ve heard.

    I guess what I can say is: give if you can and feel comfortable; focus on what you can do; and think in terms of your relationships to other people and how they shape and are shaped by our current societal structure.

      I went through a whole series of depressive episodes like that where I found every reason I could to despair about the state of my life and the world. You hit the nail on the head with feeling "humanity's collective suffering". This whole thing has been me wondering how connected I should be to that when it hurts so much but was such a key factor in how my views on morality and politics have changed.

      I do find it reassuring to think that just showing compassion towards other people means there is more compassion in the world. It's certainly a worldview I've admired in others, but have always felt like I fell short of it due to the prejudices I couldn't root out of myself. Maybe now that I finally have peace of mind again I can start working towards that. Thanks a lot, this really helped.

      That's kind of the problem, though. I actually don't want to donate any money because having it makes me feel more safe and secure. The prospect of giving it away, rather than making a transaction or supporting a someone on Patreon who makes things I like, makes me feel anxious. This is a way I have always felt about money even before my financial security was a risk.

      At the same time, that self-centered view is preventing me from doing something that would be objectively good and would not cost me a significant amount. So does that mean I should do it out of a sense of obligation towards my "religion" because it will mean I will have made a net positive decision? 

      I want to want to help people, but I find it easier to not feel empathy for the disadvantaged now that I am not at risk of suffering in a similar way. The idea that I would only do it because of selfish reasons, either out of a sense of social shame from not doing it or out of a sense of pride at having done it, is not a prospect my morality finds comforting.

      If I did it as a signal to myself or others, that would imply that I can't or won't do it out of empathy for people who lack the privileges I possess. If I accepted that about myself, it means I accomplish an objectively good thing without improving myself. If I do not accept that, it means I am prioritizing my desire to be more virtuous over the well-being of others.

        >So does that mean I should do it out of a sense of obligation towards my "religion" because it will mean I will have made a net positive decision?

        Sure, why not. Encouraging yourself and others to engage in prosocial behaviors is what religion is for. If you can do it without compromising your epistemic rationality, even better.

        > If I accepted that about myself, it means I accomplish an objectively good thing without improving myself

        You are stuck in a weird paradox because you think charity is supposed to be about improving *yourself*. The whole point of charity is that it benefits other people and does not necessarily give you any benefit. Sometimes it gives benefits like reputation, fuzzy feelings or strengthening your own empathy, but that is supposed to be a side effect. Most people you help won't care about how much empathy you have and how virtuous you are.

  The Chess engine Leela played against GM Andrew Tang in a series of bullet and ultrabullet games, with time controls of two 15+2 games(fifteen minutes a side plus two seconds every turn), four 5+2 games, eight 1+0 games, ending with a "freeplay" phase where Andrew was free to choose any time control he wanted.  this week end. Tang won once, drew 6 times, and lost 41 times. Take into account that the way Leela plays as a engine that uses machine learning is something that people have not trained themselves to defeat and it is likely that as her weaknesses are further discovered skilled chess players could manage to exploit them.

  The one win was in the time control fifteen seconds to each side.

    Why should I care about Leela as opposed to other chess AI engines? I see a lot of people mentioning it on /r/chess but I'm out of the loop.

      Because, I think, Leela doesn't have any explicit "chess knowledge" baked in, aside from the rules of the game. The algorithm is purely self-taught (by repeatedly playing games against itself), which makes it pretty good as a benchmark for how quickly algorithms of this type can learn a specialized task.

      It's an open source project that uses machine learning similar to Google's Alpha Zero project. It's going much slower since even with many volunteers donating their computing power they have a fraction of the processing Google has, but it still has seen remarkable progress. In less than a year I believe it's gone from knowing nothing except the rules to beating human grand masters. It is still significantly worse than the best chess engines like Stockfish and presumably Alpha Zero however.
