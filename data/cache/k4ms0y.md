  Eliezer calls rational fiction 'Yudkowskian' ? That's a bit presumptuous.

    Well, he doesn't anymore. Nowadays, he encourages this subreddit to compliment fiction that fits by calling it "not irrational."

    eh, I mean, considering how influencial hpmor was, I wouldn't contradict him on it.

      I think it can be both presumptuous and partially true. It's not how I'd describe the broader oeuvre of what I enjoy about this sub, but I don't begrudge him his rightful pride in his contributions, nor do I require him to pretend to be modest. Arrogance is part of his brand, and he does it in a likable enough way.

        Personally I think good practice is for a genre/field be named generally in order to make it descriptive and disassociated from the arguable founder. It's nice to recognize people's contributions but that's what history books/Wikipedia articles, etc. are for.

        Specifically, I happen to like Yudkowsky, but there are people who do not and I don't want to make it harder for them to interact with the genre.

    (He waited for someone else to call that kind of fiction that first.)

  This felt really cute until it felt really stupid.  

  I don’t think acknowledging the meta-state of stories as fiction, and characters as unreal except for the parts of them we see on screen, is a particularly rational storytelling tool.  Especially not as used here, where it’s mostly done to dodge actually answering real questions that do matter within the fiction. 

  The really frustrating thing is that if this had just ended shortly after the comment about living in a golden age, with our protagonist saying “and then it got complicated” or even just “but it all worked out” or something, I would have been way more satisfied with that as an ending. Even showing the breakup with your alien superintelligence botfriend and then lamenting that loss but focusing on the other relationships more, or something.  It just gets so pointlessly naval gazing after that.

  **groan**

  You *had* to end it with that pun, didn't you?

  This continues to be among my favorite stories.
