    My attempt at a rational one piece, at least. I'm still learning, though, so it might get better in later chapters, but we'll see.

    I admire your honesty.

    (mild spoiler) Luffy hadn't eaten a devil fruit at that point, though. I felt like making that part clear a bit later.

    I felt like having Shanks use his Haki would seem kinda appropriate since he did the same during the canon with the sea king. What I actually do agree with you is that losing his hand function was a REALLY forced aspect that I should probably do away with. 

    Either way, thanks for the feedback. I really appreciate it.
