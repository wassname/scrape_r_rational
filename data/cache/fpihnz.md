  Sufficient Velocity is holding a flash fiction contest/event, I'm posting here because A) it seems neat and B) I'll likely be contributing one or two things to it. With the global pandemic ongoing, this seems like a good time to work on writing, which doesn't require going outside or contact with others. Depending on how people feel about it, we might run our own little contest in /r/rational, especially since it's been quite some time since we've had a weekly challenge. (It would probably have to be run by someone other than me, since I'm working on an ongoing web serial and have a kid, which means that quarantine and shelter-in-place has reduced my available time.)

  I'd encourage others to join in the flash fiction thing if they have the time/output to spare.

(I actually wrote a fullish outline for the prompt a few years ago [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskScienceFiction/comments/2cp4qg/luke_and_leia_are_switched_at_birth_he_becomes/cjhs5e3/?context=3), but this is the first time I've made any words for it.)
