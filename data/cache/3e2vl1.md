## Rational Bond?

### Post:

Anyone done a rational take on Bond that leaves the role intact?

Closest I can think of is _The Jennifer Morgue_ which is more a delicious abuse of the trope.

  ```
  *The Jennifer Morgue* is definitely one I'd recommend. Also check out [*Ryan McAdamis Saves the World*](http://qntm.org/mcadamis), a short story that is sort of a play on Bondian tropes.

    Dang, I thought I'd read everything on qntm already.

    Nice one.

      I really enjoyed the idea of "30 First Drafts" for National Novel Writing Month, and most of them are quite good.
