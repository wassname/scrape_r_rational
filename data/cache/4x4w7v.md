## [Biweekly Challenge] Black and White Morality

### Post:

## Last Time

[Last time,](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4uxg75/biweekly_challenge_superheroes/?sort=confidence) the prompt was "Superheros". The winner was /u/DocFuture with their story, [The Old Man](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4uxg75/biweekly_challenge_superheroes/d633nu4). Go read it now! Congratulations to /u/DocFuture!

##### This Time

This time, we'll be doing ["Black and White Morality"](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndWhiteMorality). Write a story about pure good and ultimate evil. You are entirely welcome to do a subversion of the prompt, so long as you're rotating around that theme. If you can write a recognizably rational story which is about unambiguous good and evil (in contravention of the sidebar rule), more power to you.

The winner will be decided **Wednesday, August 24th.** You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

##### Rules

* 300 word minimum, no maximum. Post as a link to Google Docs, pastebin, Dropbox, etc. **This is mandatory.**

* No plagiarism, but you're welcome to recycle and revamp your own ideas you've used in the past.

* Think before you downvote.

* Winner will be determined by "best" sorting.

* Winner gets reddit gold, special winner flair, and bragging rights. Five-time winners get even more special winner flair, and their choice of prompt if they want it.

* All top-level replies to this thread should be submissions. Non-submissions (including questions, comments, etc.) belong in the companion thread, and will be aggressively removed from here.

* Top-level replies must be a link to Google Docs, a PDF, your personal website, etc. It is suggested that you include a word count and a title when you're linking to somewhere else.

* In the interest of keeping the playing field level, please refrain from cross-posting to other places until after the winner has been decided.

* No idea what rational fiction is? [Read the wiki!](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index)

##### Meta

If you think you have a good prompt for a challenge, [add it to the list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B6HaZc8FYkr6l6Q4cwBc9_-Yq1g0f_HmdHK5L1tbEbA/edit?usp=sharing) (remember that [a good prompt is not a recipe](http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/prompts?src=RECIPE)). Also, if you want a quick index of past challenges, I've [posted them on the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/weeklychallenge).

##### Next Time

Next time, the challenge will be "Underground". The only requirement is that the story takes place mostly underground, whether it's in a cave, a bunker, a basement, or during a journey to the center of the earth. Suggestions for stories or settings to rationalize (if you prefer not writing purely original content); The Core, Wool, Journey to the Center of the Earth, Dante's Inferno, The City of Ember, or Faerun's Underdark.

**Next challenge's thread will go up on 8/24.** Please private message me with any questions or comments, as the beloved meta thread is now archived. The companion thread [is available here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4x4yyq/challenge_companion_black_and_white_morality/)

    What does your flair mean? I can't figure it out. Is it something to do with construction? Videogame cheats? Or is it some sort of joke about anagram stoichiometry from "The Study of Anglophysics"? Or is it just a nonsense sentence designed to look like it means something so that people will wonder what it means? Sorry if this is a bit off topic but I really really want to know.

        Ideally yes, since breaking the window allows you to use the opening as both a window and a door. It's harder to use a window as a wall, after all. Except your username is blasted**0**glass, so wouldn't you be failing to break windows? :P

    Depending on the limitations, this could work, given sufficient resources. For example, no one said they have to be live humans. Can't we set up some sort of corpse freezing and shipping process? Especially if these creatures aren't vulnerable to mundane diseases? 

    If they, for some reason, need freshly killed humans, then I think we'd have no choice but to exterminate them, assuming their energy costs aren't something really low like one human every year. We can't support their species. 

    It also makes no sense in a natural environment that they would only be able to eat humans, so there appear to be some supernatural/artificial shenanigans at work here. Perhaps hacking those is an option? If not, then yea. Genocide a go.

    Interesting.

    I don't think that doing what you must in order to eat can be evil. It seems rather odd that some species must eat humans, with no possible substitute; but given that premise, I don't think it would be evil for them to do so.

    That said, I still might try to stop them, not because I think that they're evil, but as a simple matter of self-defence. There would be a clear incompatibility between our species, such that even if we respect each other, we still can't peacefully coexist.

    When thinking of morality, I like to divide judgement of the action and judgement of the person.  It works wonders for actions with unintended consequences, where you can say that a misguided attempt at good that ends up doing evil makes the action evil but the person still remains good, but I think it can apply here too.

    As expressed, it is possible that no one deserves to die, and thus killing anyone is an evil action.  With this divide, it would not matter if the person killing wants the killing to happen or not, it is an evil action.  But by the same token the action being evil does not make the person evil or good, since judgements on a person can only be based on their intentions.

    If we can assume that our vampire does not want to kill people, then you could say that her intentions are not evil, since she does not want anyone to die for the sake of their death.  With the divide, you could conclude to say that our vampire is a good person doing evil actions.

    This is all snapshot-level judgement, though.  It doesn't contain the decision of the most moral action based off of this knowledge.  Under that perspective, the question is not 'is the vampire evil?' but 'does the vampire's life cause more evil than good?'  Even if you can say that the vampire is not an evil person, the vampire is the cause of evil actions, possibly enough to say that the vampire's continued existence will cause more harm than good.  In such a case, it would be regrettable to end the life of a good person like the vampire, but it would be the right thing to do, for the sake of her victims.

    Anyways, that's just how I look at it, and there are a good deal of assumptions there, like the assumption that there is absolutely no way, now or ever, for the vampire to be allowed to survive without eating humans, and that the vampire truly does not desire the killing she is responsible for, and so on and so forth.
