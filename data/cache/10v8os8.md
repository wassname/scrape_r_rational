## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  After bouncing off it almost 3 times, I've finally become hooked to Worm. While I'm aware it's *fucking long*, I've already become fearful that, like all good things, it'll eventually come to an end.

  To help assuage the pain, I'm looking for the best Worm fanfics, be they strictly in universe or crossover works, I've seen dozens recommended over the years, but I wasn't paying attention before haha.

    I highly recommend [Trailblazer](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/trailblazer-worm-gundam-au-complete.680881/). It's a Worm/Gundam fusion in which Tailor triggered as a tinker instead of a master.

    I have never been into mecha anime, so the Gundam aspect of the crossover made me avoid reading it for a long time. Once I finally gave the fic a try, it turned out to be one of the best fanfics I have ever read. It's long (as long as Worm itself) and completed. The fanfic is continually engrossing because it diverges from canon before the story even begins, and the stations of canon never make an appearance.

    I think Trailblazer is a good fit for this sub because, due to the nature of her powers, the Tinker version of Taylor doesn't dive headlong into the mistakes that canon!Tailor did. She is forced to perform extensive recon and plan ahead before acting, thus she avoids many of the pitfalls of escalation and self-justification that canon Tailor struggled with.

    I have a [number of rated lists of Worm fics](https://www.reddit.com/user/ahasuerus_isfdb/comments/ue3kip/worm_fan_fics_ratings_explanation/).

    > it's fucking long

    It's even worse than the word count suggests. Once you finish the serial (plus the author's comments) and realize that almost everything that you thought you knew about the universe was wrong, you can go back to the beginning and re-read the text with an eye toward all the little things that went over your head the first time around. Throwaway sentences like:

    > X waited patiently as Y adjusted her cape, then strode through the door [Arc 15, the third interlude]

    suddenly become important once you read the first interlude in Arc 27.

    Also note that many Worm fics concentrate on relatively small parts of *Worm* and ignore the larger issues lurking in the background. There is nothing wrong with that as long as the author can pull it off, but it's something to keep in mind.

    I hope you finish Worm before reading fanfics. They can be all over the place with spoilers for canon.

It follows Taylor as a tinker, who can make exosuit-scale gundam suits.

  - u/Radioterrill:
    ```
    One of the defining Worm fanfics is [Cenotaph and the rest of the Memorials series](https://archiveofourown.org/series/160520), which starts with a divergence from canon right near the start of the story. It's long, close in tone and style to the original, and had a significant influence on the Worm fanfic scene - many pieces of fanon originate here.
    ```

    - u/lo4952:
      ```
      I feel like I should add a warning that, while certainly influential, Cenotaph / Memorials is one of those fics that has very much been surpassed by the overall growth of the fandom. It's a fine enough read, but it's something you'll probably only want to try right when you start reading worm fanfic, and even then halfway through the second book it kinda slumps. Once you've explored more of the actually-good content the fandom has to offer, it's very difficult to go back to Memorials. But at least it's no Silencio / Ackfic.
      ```

      - u/ahasuerus_isfdb:
        ```
        With well over 10,000 Worm fics out there, there is a great deal of variety. Of the [20 most popular fics](https://wormstorysearch.com/?direction=desc&is_nsfw_eq=any&limit=20&page=1&searching=true&sort=stories.rating):

        * *Implacable* and *Just a Phase* are "malicious compliance" fics
        * *Kill Them All* is a Gamer action-adventure-comedy with frequent musings about the morality of killing, its author's specialty
        * *There's No Way My New Little Sister Can Be The Simurgh!* is a semi-crack comedy
        * *A Finely Honed Blade* is an adventure fic with at least a couple of horror layers
        * *Constellations* is a feel-good semi-comedy
        * *Skittering Campione* is a post-canon crossover adventure with an overpowered Taylor
        * *Memories of Iron* is a crossover semi-fix-fic
        * *It Gets Worse* is a comedy
        * Argentorum's fics are primarily post-canon "sequels"
        * WestOrEast's fics are primarily porn
        * *Trump Card*, *Transposition, or: Ship Happens* and *Here Comes The New Boss* are "alternative power" fics

        etc. It gets even more diverse once you go further down the list.

          Oh, I'm well aware. I've had the pleasure and/or displeasure of reading (and writing!) quite a few worm fanfics, and there's an absolute ton of good stuff out there. There's also an overwhelming ocean of not-so-good stuff, which IMO the WSS front page tends towards. They're not all *bad* per se, just... appealing to the lowest common denominator.

          In my (very biased) opinion, the better fics tend to avoid having Taylor as the MC, or take place somewhere outside of Brockton Bay. Some of my favorites include:

          *Ghost in the Flesh,* a Worm / Love, Death, and Robots crossover,

          *Rank,* an unpowered OC story,

          *Rein,* a Worm / Fate crossover,

          *The Great Escape,* an Eidolon-POV AU where the Birdcage inmates break out,

          *Compulsion,* a Worm / Prototype crossover,

          *Luminous,* a wonderful OC fic, and

          *Loaf,* a crackfic where Contessa attempts to bake bread.
          ```

            > There's also an overwhelming ocean of not-so-good stuff, which IMO the WSS front page tends towards.

            Well, WSS measures how popular a given fic is, but it can't predict how likely a given user -- with a unique set of often evolving preferences -- is to like a given fic. Recommendation algorithms can be quite tricky as Amazon discovered years ago...

      *Worm* is primarily an attempt to recreate the "default superhero universe" in an internally consistent, [monistic](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/monism) way via a slowly revealed multi-layered secret history. I didn't find it 100% convincing, but it was a valiant effort to create a universe in which the inherently unrealistic "comic book logic", which was originally aimed at children, made sense. Its length (1.675 million words), broken characters, body horror and some longueurs in the last third of the text mean that it's not for everyone, but it has a lot of fans.

  I want to share a story that has been my favorite thing to follow in the last several years:

  [Warhammer Fantasy: Divided Loyalties - an Advisor's Quest](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/warhammer-fantasy-divided-loyalties-an-advisors-quest.44838/)

  First things first: This is a Quest on the Sufficient Velocity forum. That means that this is an interactive story where readers vote on the main character's actions and dice rolls often decide the outcome of things. So sometimes unlikely events happen out of nowhere without any real foreshadowing because that's what the dice say and some times the main character just blasts through something that should have been a challenge because, again, that's what the dice said. And on the other side of the coin, some times the player base decides on a course of actions that wasn't what the author had in mind or planned for, because players be that way.

  Next, the story posts have 920k posts total (though some of that is the list of choices at the bottom of many chapters) and there is no planned end in sight. The author started writing in 2018, initially at a pretty fast pace. Then he had a long hiatus due to health reasons, picked the story back up again with a fast writing pace, but slowed said pace down quite a bit over time and has been posting a rough average of one update a week in 2022. The story *could* end at any time where the main character does something dangerous, simply due to a few very low rolls in a row. Or it could end prematurely due to a real world reason.

  With all that out of the way, here's the positives: The prose starts good and gets better IMO. The worldbuilding is superb, taking the Warhammer Fantasy universe and massively enriching it without outright losing the spirit of canon or even outright contradicting too much (keeping in mind that actual canon is full of contradictions  which forces the author to pick and choose). The majority of characters that appear on screen are not stupid and even the "evil" cultures get fleshed out enough to satisfy someone spoiled by /r/rational. Things make as much sense as they can, given the source material and the existence of things like the Gods of Chaos. There are mysteries, sudden twists, heartfelt moments and epic achievements, all feeling extra earned because failure is always literally something that can happen at any time.

  The main character is great, with her own convictions, strengths, flaws, areas of confidence and insecurities. She is supported by a variety of characters, some by her side during parts of her story and some recurring throughout.

  The starting premise is that the main character is a Grey Wizard Journeywoman who is placed as the official Spymaster for the new Elector Count of Stirland due to strings pulled by some unknown conspiracy. For those not familiar with Warhammer:

  * The Empire of Sigmar is a federal polity of mostly Humans. They are the "main characters" of Warhammer Fantasy, but far far less grimdark than their scifi counterparts in Warhammer 40k.

  * Below the Emperor there are the so called Elector Counts. They each govern a Province and they vote for the new Emperor when the old one dies.

  * In this Quest each Elector Count (and each ruler really) is advised by his small council (think Game of Thrones or the Crusader Kings game). The Spymaster does the intrigue and counterintelligence stuff and the like.

  * Stirland is a relatively poor Province. It borders Sylvania, a breakaway polity full of Vampires, Necromancers and other Undead. Necromancy is illegal and hated throughout the Empire.

  * In the last couple centuries magic has been partially legalized. There are eight different Colleges for the eight different Winds of Magic that flow through the planet's atmosphere. Humans usually can only channel one color of magic without going crazy.

  * The Grey Wind does stuff like stealth, illusions, mind manipulation, armor piercing attacks and other things related mostly to fog and shadows. The Grey College are involved a lot in spying and assassinations and stuff, but also do general magic research and living artillery like every other Wizard College.

  * A Journeyman is a Wizard who freshly graduated from the College and is supposed to wander around and gather experience on their own before graduating to Magister.

  In case you want to know more, including maybe a few spoilers, [I have recommended this story in another subreddit over a year ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/warhammerfantasyrpg/comments/lrudv5/this_interactive_warhammer_fanficrpg_is_currently/).

    ```
    I noticed/remembered that certain aspects that came up in character creation did not get directly repeated in the first actual story chapters. So here's a list of details on the main character as she was at the very beginning of the story:

    * Name: Mathilde Weber

    * Age: ~20

    * Origin: Stirland peasant

    * Reason for becoming Spymaster: Unknown conspiracy placed her there through her Master and wants her to act as an inside agent for them.

    * Favored deity: Ranald, trickster God of luck, fortune, and thieves. Barely tolerated by polite society.

    * Starting spells: Create Sound, Enchant Weapon, Enchant Armor, Summon Magic Shadowhorse and Mindhole (attempt to make someone forget everything they know of you).

    * Has considerable college debts.

    * Is hunted by a mirror-dwelling snake spirit.

    * Is brave.

        I agree. Thing is, QMs just don't think of that at the time and I guess starting to do it halfway through feels awkward. But yeah, what you said should be normalized. But telling someone who is already writing a whole story for me for free to put in more effort in the peripherals doesn't seem completely correct either. I don't know.

        Edit: I looked at archive.org, but [the oldest version](https://web.archive.org/web/20190225181931/https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/warhammer-fantasy-divided-loyalties-an-advisors-quest.44838/page-6) seems to be from three months in, somewhere into the beginning of the second major arc. Much closer to the original character sheet, but still containing a few spoilers. Specifically: >!Earned and found magical equipment, spoilers on a major battle, career promotion, introduction of a character, major magical traits, official titles and other miscellaneous things.!< (Mild spoilers pointing out larger spoilers)
        ```

  - u/Flashbunny:
    ```
    Divided Loyalties is superb. One thing that might particularly appeal to this community is that on several occasions a player has had a really good idea about how to approach a problem that the QM hadn't thought of, and rather than handwave it away the QM has let it happen, so long as it makes sense.

    I've seen many a quest where outside-the-box thinking gets shut down for trivialising a problem, so seeing cleverness be rewarded is quite gratifying.

  ```
  Any recommendations for media where the main character starts and ends the story in the same stable relationship, and with their partner playing a decent role in the story?
  ```

  - u/sl236:
    ```
    This is a thing I also particularly note; there is so little out there where main characters have a stable, equal relationship, neither of them betrays the other or gets killed off and they are still just as stable at the end. Like the wizard in 'An Ordinary Miracle' said, "It's shameful to kill off characters just to jolt the cold-hearted and stir the indifferent."

    * Louis McMaster Bujold's Sharing Knife series (after the setup novel) has a stable married couple at its center.

    * Penric and Desdemona in her "Penric and Desdemona" novella series are also technically exactly this - probably not in the sense you meant it, but they're awesome books.

    * Further on the subject of "not a romantic relationship", Naomi Novik's Temeraire books have this and are excellent fun (although there is an idiot ball doing the occasional pass through the side characters, it's not too bad).

    * If older murder mystery/spy stories are your thing, Agatha Christie's series about Tommy and Tuppence feature a couple solving crimes and doing spy stuff. They get together in the first novel ("The Secret Adversary") and subsequent books follow them as they get older together, from about 1920 to about 1970, I think.

    * ["Fred the Vampire Accountant"](https://www.goodreads.com/series/164322-fred-the-vampire-accountant) isn't all that rational, but is a good fun popcorn series with not too much idiot ball and a stable relationship.

    * ["Apothecary Diaries"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Apothecary_Diaries) is probably not *quite* what you intend - the relationship is a stable one, both characters are empowered, and the stories are rational and jolly good fun, but the relationship is that thin line between "friends" and "couple" that certain stories like to tread in perpetuity. (Both the manga and light novels are great, but the light novels are a much denser, richer read, natch). 

    * [Tori, Transmigrated](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/47030/tori-transmigrated) is a popcorn read that also has that form of relationship, and a *lot* of empowered characters - somewhat less rational and still ongoing, but one of the better takes on the "isekai villainness" thing IMO. 

    * This sort of thing wouldn't normally appear in /r/rational, but as I mentioned, there's surprisingly little out there overall, so if you still need that itch scratching... ["I can't understand what my husband is saying"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Can%27t_Understand_What_My_Husband_Is_Saying), ["Fly Me To The Moon"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fly_Me_to_the_Moon_%28manga%29), [Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miss_Kobayashi%27s_Dragon_Maid) (the anime specifically; for a franchise that started as fetish porn, it's got no right to be that wholesome), ["A Brush With Magic"](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1905038437) and its sequel.

    * I'll take the opportunity to plug my other half's comic "Trade Winds", which centers around a stably married couple. Ebook [here](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0971S5F74/) or you can read it free [online](https://www.toothycat.net/tradewinds/) if you don't mind a web 1.0 site ;)

        I use Moon+ Reader on Android, and one of its many features is regex text replacement, and you can configure it per-book or global. Caveat: I use the paid version and it's great, but someone here a while ago told me that the free version was gutted, so I'm not sure how recommendable the free version is. 

        You'll need to get an epub, but that's easily solved with FanFicFare or [FicHub](https://fichub.net/)

  I’m back again with more recommendations! I’ve decided to discharge my vast collection of fics over the years, so I’ll be releasing these each week.

  [Oh My God! Earthlings are Insane!](https://freewebnovel.com/oh-my-god-earthlings-are-insane/chapter-1.html)

  This is a cultivation transmigration novel where an entire city is transmigrated to a foreign world known simply as “The Other World.” It led to the total collapse of civilization and eventual reemergence in the city, after the people brutally experimented on each other to pioneer cultivation techniques. I found the schemes and plots in this novel extremely frightening and enjoyable, and the main character is extremely smart. As he developed, I got the sense that he was exactly like Li Yao from 40k cultivation - he smart, there’s grand conspiracies, he has to defend his morals in situations where most would become depraved, etc. There’s philosophical discussions on human morality, ethics, the nature of civilization, etc, just like 40k cultivation. It’s pretty good, in all honesty.


  Now, moving onto the rare crossovers! I love these, and love hunting down well written fics in this category.

  [Red Thorn](https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13453490/1/Red-Thorn) by moguera (1447k words)

  **RWBY / Samurai Deeper Kyo** - Complete

  *This takes place in RWBY, and the premise is that Ruby suffered a similar injury like in the fic Matters of the Heart, but not to the point that she gained a permanent heart condition. Her father grew overprotective and monstrous, locking her away, and Ruby ran away from home and took up the sword as a wandering swordsman with the help of a powerful mentor.*

  [My Hero School Adventure is All Wrong, As Expected](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/my-hero-school-adventure-is-all-wrong-as-expected-bnha-x-oregairu.697066/#post-52178275) by storybooknight (370k words)

  **BNHA / OreGairu** - In Progress

  *A BNHA fic which blends characters from the OreGairu verse, you get to see Hikigaya’s special brand of nihilism in play conflicting with hero society’s ideals. He writes an amusing (scathing) UA admission essay critiquing hero society as materialistic and fame driven, and concludes it by saying that as the most materialistic and fame driven person in the world, he is naturally the most suited to be a hero. Somehow, UA admits him, and Hikigaya is thrown into the world of heroics.*

  [A Kaiserin’s Post Living Arrangements](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-kaiserins-post-living-arrangements-youjo-senki-fate-crossover.833232/) by Lord Caelum (320k words)

  **Fate / Youjo Senki** - Hiatus

  *This fic is actually fanfiction of another fanfiction: specially, A Young Woman’s Political Record. It follows Tanya’s life after she successfully dominates the world through her political guile. She died sometime after the Cold War, and becomes a Servant in the Fifth Grail War as a Caster.*

  That’s all for the rare crossovers today. I have more rare crossovers, but I’ve gotta save some for the coming weeks. Next up is non crossover fanfiction.

  [The Immortal Game](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/1886/the-immortal-game) by AestheticB (297k words)

  **My Little Pony** - Complete


  *This was pretty intense, I’m not gonna lie. The premise is that apocalypse arrives in the MLP world, and everyone has to band together to resist the end of the world - the awakening of Celestia’s father. It features a very unique magic system known as Bladecasting, which relies on conviction to telekinetically control magical blades to strike down foes. All in all, this was a very dark and intense fic.*

  [The Surprising Adventures of a Glaceon in Unova](https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6964056/1/The-Surprising-Adventures-of-a-Glaceon-in-Unova) by Captain Spock (382k words)

  **Pokemon** - Complete

  *This is a Pokémon journey fanfiction from the perspective of a Glaceon named Boreas in the trainer’s party, which is surprisingly excellently written. I found it incredibly enjoyable to read. It takes place in the Unova Region, and sees the protagonists always in conflict with Team Plasma.*

  Is there something that takes the litrpg/system genre and explores it from the other side? That is it follows a maintainer/admin instead of player.


  Preferably the system(on the user side of it) is on the softer side and is not explicitly gamified. Something that goes more in the direction of This used to be about dungeons or Only villains do that then standard RoyalRoad litrpg for example.

  Does anyone know any good monster MC novels? Or at least suitably non-human. I love the concept of an alien existence coming to terms with and exploring a world unknown to them, dealing with threats and civilizations both. It’s such an engaging concept but the offerings are either slim or mediocre. The series I believe embodies this concept the best is “So I’m a Spider, So What?” with a MC that is fun, competent, and notably inhuman, and her affecting the world was really interesting.

  The other monster MC novels I’ve read have all been lacking that magic. ELLC would be the closest, but there’s all the weird fetish stuff and the horrible ending. Chrysalis suffers from Anthony being a dumbass and getting rewarded for not being serious about his build, plot armor, and other such issues. But maybe that’s just my gripes on MCs deserving their power and status through their actions and struggles. The author is incredibly skilled at worldbuilding however.

  Shade Touched is a dead story, I heard Fleabag suffers from no focus on the wider world and other issues, Born Different is promising but doesn’t have too many chapters. Salvos is basically a human and has some issues that bothers me. The teddy bear litrpg one was alright, but suffers from too much boring pointless litrpg.

  Does anyone know of any really good monster/nonhuman MC novels? Webfiction, published novels, anything is alright. There’s something so engaging about the concept, of a nonhuman creature coming into and exploring the world, as well as how they affect civilizations. War Queen is good but its not that addictive newborn monster’s journey that I’m looking for.

    Can't recommend [Super Minion](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21410/super-minion) enough, if you've somehow made it this far without reading it. The MC is an escaped bioweapon learning to live in the middle of a jam-packed megacity.

    [KOKOMO](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6091474/1/KOKOMO) is a Mass Effect fanfic one-shot about a Vorcha.

    [Onwards to Providence](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/34353/onward-to-providence/chapter/528375/loading-00) is about a living spaceship tentacle monster and it's solitary crew member, hauling cargo across the universe. Plus, it's illustrated.

    • ~~*[Everybody Loves Larges Chests](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/8894/everybody-loves-large-chests)* — rational enough, though has its moments; also good worldbuilding, character designs, fight scenes. Smut-heavy.~~

    • *[Symbiote](https://farmerbob1.wordpress.com/2013/11/13/chapter-1-a-meeting-of-the-minds/)* by Farmerbob1 — rational, the "monster" character is not the prot, but someone close by.

    • *[Iron Teeth, The](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/4293/the-iron-teeth-a-goblins-tale)* — the first several plot arcs are ~rational enough, but the further the story progresses the more it degrades.

    • ~~*[Threadbare](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/15130/threadbare)* — interesting worldbuilding, plot devices, character designs, but fails to deliver on an implied promise and ultimately is not rational.~~

    • [*Dark Skies*](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/32807/dark-skies) by Tigersight — fits on the "coming to terms with and exploring a world unknown to them" bit, but not necesserily on the "monster" bit.

    • [*Rational Zombie, A*](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/22533/a-rational-zombie-complete) — strives to be rational, even if isn't.

    • [*Salvos*](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/37438/hellprinces-salvos-a-monster-evolution-litrpg) by MelasD — the starting arcs fit the request; not rational.

    • [*Void Domain*](https://www.towercurator.com/void-domain/) by towercurator — the "monster" character is not the prot, but someone close by. The story is partially relevant in another way as well.

    • *[Parasyte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasyte)* by Hitoshi Iwaaki — request-wise is similar to the other Symbiote; entertaining combat scenes, but not rational (esp. the ending).

    • [*Great Core's Paradox, The*](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/40888/the-great-cores-paradox) — may be an entertaining read, but is not rational. And the prot's thinking process is often steered in needed directions to railroad the plot.

    I've started reading it lately and it's pretty legit. On the one hand the author is clearly new and his technique can be pretty raw, but on the other his work is overflowing with a million great ideas, and he has an undeniable sense of style and mood to his writing.

      Her followup, Bioshifter is also in that same vein.

    there is a story called "The Great Core's Paradox" on Royalroad.

  Every single one of [John Wyndham's](https://www.bookseriesinorder.com/john-wyndham/) science fiction books. I recently found a heap of them included in my membership on Audible.

I've been trying to find similar authors and found some of [Jules Verne](https://www.bookseriesinorder.com/jules-verne/) hits the spot.

    Jules Verne was my favourite author growing up, and definitely got me into both Fantasy and Sci-Fi at an early age.

    Fun fact: His book *The Begum's Millions* is credited as the first sci fi book to explore the possibility of chemical weapons and how terrifying they would be, all the way back in 1879.

      Unfortunately, early English translations of his books were often abominable -- see [this article](https://www.depauw.edu/sfs/backissues/95/evansttrans95.htm) for details -- and some of them remained in print for generations. Also, after Verne's death his son made major changes to his father's remaining manuscripts before publishing them.

      In recent years University of Nebraska and other organizations/individuals have been trying to restore and re-translate Verne's works, e.g. see [Bison Frontiers of Imagination](https://www.nebraskapress.unl.edu/series/bison-frontiers-of-imagination/).

  I want to recommend an absolutely fantastic fanfiction called "[Purple Days](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/purple-days-asoiaf-joffrey-timeloop-au.450894/reader/)". It's an ASOIAF fanfiction from the perspective of Joffrey caught in a time loop.
  ```

  - u/Dufaer:
    ```
    While I loved *Purple Days*, one thing that really bothered me about it was that it visits and explores all the mythical and far-off places of canon *ASoIaF* and substitutes nothing in their place.

    Places like Bonetown, Carcosa and K'Dath exist in canon to make the world seem vast, old and mysterious.

    Should you actually get to, for example, Carcosa, the locals there should have knowledge (or at least myths) about what lies further east.

    But in *Purple Days*, there doesn't seem to exist anything interesting or important east of Carcosa that's not already known to people two continents away. Neither is there apparently anything south of the Summer Isles worth mentioning.

    The more the story explores its world, the smaller that world seems.
    ```

    - u/Jello_Raptor:
      ```
      This just seems like how it's supposed to work. 

      The thing about having a vast terra incognita is that, once you go poking around in it, it just becomes terra. 

      Purple days is built around a conflict that exists in geologic time. The physical size of a planet just can't compete. If you're looking for a feeling of mystery in the north, south, east, or west in this you're looking in the wrong directions. Try any of the other four.
      ```

      - u/Dufaer:
        ```
        No. It's as if in the Age of Discovery, Europeans had sailed all across the world and discovered nothing they hadn't heard of before:

        Suppose Europeans had known of China, so they sailed to China, and it turned out there was nothing south or east of China. No Oceania, no Australia, no Antarctica, no Japan. The Chinese would be like "Yup. This is the end of the world. If what you need cannot be found here, you better turn around and look for it north or west of here.". And this would then repeat for every other part of the world.
        ```

        - u/Jello_Raptor:
          ```
          Yes, it is like that. Is that a problem? 

          From a Watsonian perspective: 

          There's no reason that a planet's landmass has to be particularly distributed over its surface. Having all the above water land in a single hemisphere isn't particularly implausible. Just take any of Earth's supercontinental eras and raise the sea level a bit. 

          Also, I know YiTi isn't a direct analog of imperial china but have you seen how self absorbed the imperial Chinese were at points? Going "sorry, this is the end of the world. There's nothing of worth to see anywhere over there" would have been entirely in character, even if they knew of land and humans living somewhere. 

          Then there's the summer isles. A Polynesian analog stuck on an archipelago where there isn't anything within sailing range in one or two directions? Going "yeah, there's nothing there, don't bother" is life saving advice for them. 

          Then there's the doylist perspective: 

          Going through the different 'mysterious' places from canon one by one and making them less mysterious is the point. Purple days doesn't want you to look for mystery and awe in places on the world. It wants you to look at the chain of actions that led to the time loop, which has a scope covering eons. It wants you to look at the planetary scale of the red comet and contrast the tiny pinprick that is the main characters. Getting rid of the map-based mystery that GRRM added makes easier to focus on what the author wanted to convey. 

          The characters were also doing through the world looking for solutions to a problem. Being about to say "yeah you checked everywhere, got some character development, and don't have to search anymore." is the point. It forces Joffrey to look at alternate strategies, instead of meandering about the globe. Sure, the time limit does this more effectively but not actually having anywhere else to go helps.
          ```

          - u/Dufaer:
            ```
            From a Watsonian perspective, having "all that is known in Westeros" and "all that is possibly relevant to saving the world" coincide is improbable.

            From a Doylist perspective, it feels like the author made a checklist of "all canon mystical places" and decided that every single one, but no original one was going to be relevant.

            "Failing to imagine anything beyond canon" is a common failing in fanfiction. And it feels weird that while *Purple Days* manages to avoid this failing in so many respects, it fails in this particular geography sense, when in could have been easily avoided.

            (Yes I know there are two original locations, but one is an isolated time capsule and the other is enemy infrastructure - they are isolated from the world and not part of any culture or even myth.)

    I want to use this opportunity to mention the Yi Ti arc of that fanfic is such a mess (basically an unrelated novel inserted into the plot) that you're better off skipping it.
    ```

    - u/fljared:
      ```
      I felt it was important for giving Joffrey room to grow by putting him somewhere where his place is earned rather than given, and giving him something to fight *for*. That it is also mostly an OC setting without much relation to the canon, known countries/cultures is something of a detraction, even if it's well put together.
      ```

    - u/EliezerYudkowsky:
      ```
      Weird, that was one of my favorite parts.
      ```

      - u/Makin-:
        ```
        The thing is that if it was its own story it wouldn't even be that bad, but it's part of a Game of Thrones time loop story and it barely has either of those elements. It's out of place, and way too long even as a gimmick loop. The writer could have had a similar way to develop Joffrey's character while also hanging out with characters we know, I'm sure.
        ```

    - u/Tiraon:

      I would not frame it like that. It is a distinct arc that is still important for the character of Joffrey. Personally I actually liked it.

    I enjoyed DMG=MA with the understanding that it's very short, simple, and intentionally absurd. Closer to an exploration of a prompt than an individual novel(la). Fun internet nonsense. It's also more of a Xianxia parody than a litrpg parody, so you might not have got those references if you don't read the genre.
    ```

    - u/Jello_Raptor:
      ```
      Yup, it's a send up of xianxia and shitty light novels more than anything. I mostly enjoyed for how awful it was. Being short was a good thing. It's a single comedy skit, not a long form sitcom. Trying to stretch the former into the latter doesn't work. 

      Honestly, the thing I enjoyed about it was how much it felt like someone trying to be an r/rational author with a crack premise, realizing that it's hard to do good world building, throwing their hands up, and deciding "fuck it, I'm too lazy for this". 

      Not something I'd enjoy more than once, but was pretty fun for what it was.

    I kind of want more anti-recs in these threads. I'm also not sure why F=MA made it so high up in royal road, but then again as you've pointed out, the top rated list is mostly terrible. 

    I think what's happening is that you're getting

    1. Authors hit some success with something kind of interesting and then keep churning that out (Beware of Chicken) with no end because they've got Patreon's and new stuff is scary. Like the length of some of these stories is unbelievable, nothing happens for hundreds of chapters.
    2. You see copycats. I'm not sure who started the litrpg cycle, the gamer trope predated it from memory, but it's infected everything and replaced any kind of stakes. I don't think Litrpg is inherently bad, but it covers a lot of sins and allows for bad authors to feed their MC powers without any effort to get them.
    3. Seemingly people like many short chapters than fewer well written chapters. A lot of them just spam poorly written chapters that have no story structure or any editing. It keeps people invested with a lot of cliffhangers and so I guess ends up getting more readers into rising and then onto the top rated because it has more ratings.

    There are some exceptional stories on Royal Road and ones I'd have happily paid for. I just don't understand why they aren't more highly rated.

    1. Virtuous Sons is genuinely excellent and super creative, legit better than any other cultivation novel I've read. It's my favourite work on RR and I can't wait to read each chapter. It's always a wild ride and fairly dense in a way most webfiction isn't.
    2. This used to be about dungeons - alex wales doesn't miss.
    3. Ave Xia Rem Y - read it and it had a mediocre start but it ended up having great arc and plenty of conflict to keep driving the story. I'm invested now and the cultivation mumbo jumbo is mostly replaced as a soft magic system. 
    4. Industrial Strength Magic ends up falling into some Litrpg tropes but it has some genuinely hilarious moments and reads more like a crackfic than anything else. No real major arcs and character development isn't much to write about, but it's absolutely carried by it's worldbuilding and humour.
    ```

    - u/zechamp:
      ```
      >the top rated list is mostly terrible.

      Really? Out of the stories in the top 20 I've read (Super Minion, Trailer Trash, Demon Core, MoL, Perfect Run, Essence of Cultivation, Nowhere Stars), I've loved most of them a ton. Which ones are the terrible stories?

      None of your points really apply to the best-rated list. Spamming endless cliffhangers for hundreds of short chapters? The best-rated list prefers fewer, longer chapters. Only one story in the top 20 is over 200 chapters. Copycats? LitRPG is a lot less prevalent in the high ranks than in the rest of the site (Only 6/20, compared to much more elsewhere).

      Virtuous sons and ISM are both highly rated, still in the top 40 and they've been in the top 10 before. I think VS was hurt by readers being mad at slow releases and going to KU.
      ```

    - u/Dragongeek:
      ```
      Alright. I've looked through the current top, and I've read or tried a lot of them. My general impression is that they're okay on average, with a few that I feel are too highly rated (although the really problematic ones that used to hang out on this list seem to have been pushed down a couple pages). Nothing really stands out as absolutely fantastic, and most of my favorite fics are rated lower or not on this list. 

      Here's a Lightning round of RR's top-of-all-time:

      - Mother of Learning: Staple /r/rational crop. Good stuff.

      - The Last Orellen: Good stuff, but short. Author has auto-resurrected, will be watching
      - Ghost in the City: Sugar Popcorn. Decent, gives Kill-Them-All vibes with less escalation
      - Nowhere Stars: Haven't read.

      - Cyber Dreams: Haven't read, new entrant
      - A Journey of Black and Red: Good stuff. This is what I think of when I think of Vampires. Recommend. 
      - Fox's Tounge and Kirin's Bone: People tell me this is good, but I bounced off. [This felt relevant](https://xkcd.com/483/)
      - Borne of Desire: Pokemon, ew
      - 12 Miles Below: Haven't read. 
      - Borne of Caution: Pokemon, ew
      - RE: Trailer Trash: Definitely character focused. Good stuff, but not much happens. I read this in small doses whenever a couple chapters have accumulated
      - Demon Core: Haven't read, new entrant. 
      - Vainqueuer the Dragon: Tried it, bounced off. 
      - Essence of Cultivation: Tried it, bounced off. 

      From here, I'll start skipping those I haven't read. 

      - The Calamitous Bob: Same author as Journey of Black and Red. Good. 
      - Jackal Among Snakes: It does the genre that it says on the tin, but I remember it being very Mary Sue
      - There is no Epic Loot here, Only Puns: Fine, I guess. Suffers from character bloat
      - Orochimama: Funny as shit
      - Paranoid Mage: I could write a longer review on this but I'm gonna give it a tentative de-rec. I really liked the worldbuilding--I'm a sucker for masquerade magic urban fantasy settings--but there are just some fundamental issues that I can't look past. 
      - Underland: Currently listening to as audiobook. Good stuff. 
      - Practical Guide to Sorcery: Decent
      - Industrial Strength Magic: Macronomicon is a solid author who writes solid stuff, this included. 
      - Edge Cases: Gets a lot of praise, but I bounced off
      - Sunflower: Interesting stuff, but definitely weird
      - Azarinth Healer: Staple of RR. Good Popcorn, but a bit too many fight scenes imo
      - Shade Touched: Shame it's dead. Not bad. 
      - Prophecy Approved Companion: I remember liking this, but eventually I lost interest
      - Many Lives of Cadence Lee: I'm a sucker for repeated reincarnation. Dead
      - Book of the Dead: Decent, but eventually I lost interest 
      - Never Die Twice: Listened to as an audiobook. I liked thinking about the morals here. Interesting discussion point. Good stuff. 
      - Epilogue: I like
      - Threadbare: I like
      - Cinnamon Bun: Ravensdagger's noncon-bodymod fetish 
      - Stray Cat Strut: Ravensdagger's noncon-bodymod fetish, again
      - Post Human: SciFi among a sea of Fantasy. I like this specific subgenre
      - Devil's Foundry: Meh, not bad. 
      - Blue Core: Ick, why's it gotta be a sex dungeon
      - Arrogant Young Master Template A Variation 4: Knee-slapping hilarious
      - etc.

      I thought the anti-rec was rather pointless since I'm coming to this thread to find things to read, and not things to not read. Given that there are millions of stories out there, I definitely don't want to read anti-recs for all of them. A recommendation conveys much more information than an anti-rec because the prior should be that any given story is not good.

        I've long thought of this place as more of a book club than anything else. One member of a book club read a book and disliked it enough to write up a paragraph about it. Not really a big deal, you know? I would likely get annoyed if 90% of posts became people saying "I read a random story with seven views and it was bad," but until then I like the posts. 

        Plus, I feel like anti-recs can be just as useful in some circumstances as recs, provided adequate information is given, such the case a while ago when someone wrote a comment about some story they described as "queer isekai space communism" or something like that. For some people, that combination of words indicates a story they very much want to avoid. For others, it immediately intrigues them and they enjoyed reading it.

        I agree. To me, "anti-recs" are only useful as contrasting opinions on something that has already been recommended here. That way, rather than one negative data point, we get a (hopefully) interesting discussion that will help viewers determine if the story is something that appeals to them. Some criticisms such as 'this story lacks action' could actually be positives for people with different tastes, i.e. people who enjoy reading slice of life. Thus, more civil discussion is a good thing.

  I want to recommend [Tori Transmigrated](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/47030/tori-transmigrated)
  Not necessarily rational, and some definite idiot ball moments BUT
  It's very fun seeing the mc deal with the stupidly that goes their way and watching how the story progresses.

  Cons:
  Goes a bit slice of life as mc gets past a the constant conflict, I just skipped it when it was tedious. 
  Mc forgoes an opportunity to hamper an opponent with no actual good reason why, this gave me mild annoyance rage. 
  Mc is a Mary sue. 

  Even with the above though, definitely enjoyed it, far far more than I expected to, please read and validate my recommendation! (or not)

  Also open for any recs!

    I derec Tori. There’s just way way too much slice of life and way too little conflict (though if you like that, give it a go). The little conflict that there is involves her basically dominating her opponents. 

    A lot of the conflict comes from >!mind-controlled brain-addled morons trying to “protect” a random character which because they can’t critically think, backfires immediately!< or from >!the empire giving her ridiculous responsibilities despite wanting to relax which ends up being because the guy in charge is using a magic ouija board to run his empire!<. Admittedly, there does seem to be an overarching plot, but it happens very slowly.

      > way too little conflict

      This a 100%. It's my popcorn fic, but the best bits were always the conflict with other characters. The initial chapters where she's getting bullied and all the other antagonists were conspiring against her was absolute peak daytime tv.

  I've been rereading L. E. Modesitt Jr's "The Magic of Recluse", and the world building and pacing and dedication to slice of life style is so incredibly different from what we get nowadays. I'm loving it.

  Also I love the, like, epic level adventurers retired to be crafters vibe the island has.

  ```
  Early days for both shows yet so risky rec, but I'll mention "Ooyukiumi no Kaina" and "Hikari no Ou" - postapocalyptic fantasy anime airing right now (yes, two in the same season! - something in the air, perhaps); both look like they have a very high standard of worldbuilding and no main character has an obvious idiot ball yet.

  Any good dungeon core recommendations? I liked "dungeon core? nah I think I'll get super wealthy instead" and "I woke up as a dungeon, now what?" I don't like stories where 99 people enter the the dungeon and die horrible deaths, but guy 100 totally believes he can make it.

    I really enjoy [Dungeon Without a System](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/48893/the-dungeon-without-a-system) on RoyalRoad, the worldbuilding and designing is exactly the stuff I read dungeon core novels for. The author is a dungeon builder after my own heart. It does a good job of balancing designing, world building, and murdering. My only issues with it is that the power system is really wonky and uncertain. The upcoming war arc looks to be really exciting.

    A bit unconventional, but some of my other favorite dungeon core novels aren’t about the dungeon building. These are the two dungeon core novels by Razzmatazz on RoyalRoad, [Demon Core](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/57837/demon-core-a-demon-king-dungeon-core-litrpg) and [FINAL Core](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/54046/final-core-a-holy-dungeon-core-litrpg). What separates these two from every other dungeon core series I’ve read is that the author is actually good at writing a story and characters. These two stories have Dungeon Core MCs, but they’re primarily a story and character focused novel first. Demon Core especially is a dark, brooding, chilling, and artistic work, and well deserves its place on the first page of Best Rated. Demon Core is also possibly one of the most haunting and horrific fictions on the site, at least among the ones I’ve read. What I also like is that the system is understated, and the prompts and boxes that do show up only serve to enhance the story. Just take a look at the first chapter, the howl that never stops. It by itself is a masterpiece, and is at least 10k words.

    I would not say this one is particularly good, but I enjoyed Dinosaur Dungeon somewhat, due to its focus on dinosaurs. Cat Core is similarly alright for focusing on cats, and it makes up for mediocre writing by having an old granny as the MC. Admittedly that actually made it really hilarious, even despite being a mediocre story.

    [Goblin Cave](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/54904/goblin-cave). It's real good. It's what Stanislaw Lem would write if he was on Royal Road.

    [Dungeon Core Chat Room](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/43271/dungeon-core-chat-room/) is a more lighthearted, progression-y kind of thing. The ideas are clever and follow one another nicely, and the other parts of the story don't get in the way.
