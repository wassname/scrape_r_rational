  Hey, this isn't Pokemon :)

    Probably autocorrect for 'shinobi'... does the author read this sub?

  I'm now severely confused. Are these new chapters in some sort of alternate universe from the first few? There are all these weird inconsistencies that make no sense otherwise.

    ```
    FanFicBias decided to try writing a few chapters of a rational Shikamaru in the regular canon setting of Naruto, hence the first three chapters. I assume that FanFicBias liked what he wrote and chose to leave up those chapters while he restarted all over again on chapter four. Think of chapters 1-3 as a proof of concept with all later chapters as the actual project.
