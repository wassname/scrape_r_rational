## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  > * Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*

  I stand by my [earlier notion](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2txg42/metad_they_should_have_sent_a_poet/?ref=search_posts) that a protagonist suitable for a ratfic of *Alice in Wonderland* is a poet, even if one's immediate thought for "Rational Alice" is some kind of psychologist.

  Radiohumans. Humanity evolved with the ability to communicate radio signals with each other, generating radio traffic and such.

  I don't have even rudimentary knowledge of radio physics, but I imagined that it will have profound effect on civilization.

  Human beings will have to organize and solve problem regarding radio interference in a town, for example. 

  Ancient warfare also involved electronic warfare, with radio screamers disrupting communication on the other side. Combat is much more fluid with real-time coordination being done by radio.

  Technology will advance faster simply due to more communication.

  Some humans will figure out how to communicate using the ionosphere, creating a global communication network even before the age of sail.
  ```

  - u/Chronophilia:
    ```
    I think the effect might not be as profound as you think. It's just ordinary talking, except "louder" - you can be radio-heard at longer ranges.

    Radio waves are not unlike sound waves. They decay following the inverse-square law, and are also naturally deflected or absorbed by certain materials. Waves pass through one another, interfering but not interacting. Probably the biggest difference is that radio is effectively instantaneous while sound is limited to ~300m/s.

    I said radio was longer-range than sound, but that really depends on how "loud" it is and how sensitive your "hearing" is. Depending on exactly how it works, the effective range could be, well, anything. For all I know it could be shorter-range than talking. Longer-range isn't necessarily better, either - as you know, if a large crowd all tries to talk at once then you'll be drowned out at more than a few centimetres. That effect would be much worse if your hearing was good enough to pick up noise from an entire city.

    Another question is how wide the bandwidth that people can perceive, and how well they can distinguish between similar frequencies. The more sounds you can distinguish, the better you can pick out one person's voice from a crowd.

    I don't think we'd see electronic warfare or battlefield-wide coordination, at least no more or less than we do in reality. Screaming at the enemy is not known to disrupt their conversation.

    At least there aren't many natural sources of radio waves. I think it's just lightning bolts. No need for "ear protection" when doing, say, construction work.
    ```

    - u/Gaboncio:
      ```
      Actually, I don't think that the speed of light and the speed of sound are all that different for the purposes of human communication. They're both much faster than literally any other relevant speed in normal life. 

      It would be weird to be able to hear clearly through most of our walls. Maybe these people would build with rebar a lot quicker than us?
      ```

  - u/Gaboncio:
    ```
    Ouch. Some first impressions:

     * Human bodies are equipped with some magical HAM radios? You have to pick the scope of the power before doing anything else. 

    * Do you basically just want to write a story where all humans are telepathic without saying telepathy?

    * Radio technology is mostly used to transmit sound. If we had the ability to communicate on the radio since birth (or before), would our languages even use sound? Seems unlikely, depending on how the magic works. 

    * If humans have this ability, did we evolve it? Were we granted it through divine intervention (or aliens)? If we evolved it, to what extent can other animals use this? How does that affect animal-human relations?

    * Even though we knew about radios and how they work, it took us a lot of time and theoretical plasma physics research to even attempt to use the ionosphere as a reflector for sending messages across the horizon. Even if we discovered it through trial and error, what makes you think any human body could produce the kind of transmitting/receiving power necessary to make this work?

    * Lastly, even though humans can currently hear more than one conversation at a time, we have a very hard time actually interpreting them and carrying out two conversations simultaneously. The sort of mass communication/coordination in battle that you're thinking of would be very hard to achieve through magic telepathy. In the middle of a pitched battle between two armies, the only difference between the light and sound is how easily light can propagate through it. Even then, if you put a bunch of radio transceivers in one place and have them all try to communicate with each other at the same time, you get the same problems than if you have a bunch of people in a room (or a battlefield) together and have them yell at the same time. 

    In conclusion: how would you make this different than having super-hearing, and how would you get around human processing power limitations?
    ```

      From the conversation on the discord server, I can answer some of these.

      There was discussion about the possible non-development of audible language. There wasn't a conclusion, that I saw anyway. Personally, I think the development of audible language is still probable, but I may be misjudging it.

      While the reason why humans develop radio-hearing is magical (Or at least, we haven't figured out how or why humans would evolve it. There was some mention of this being on another planet with more metal-rich surface soil, but it was still supposed to be about humans? So I don't know.), exactly how we radio-hear is not. I believe the general consensus was that humans have four antennae embed in their humeri and radii bones, with a couple bundles of electroceptive neurons in the elbow, and stacks of current-generating muscles in the upper torso.

      I don't know the science behind how much energy it would take, being filtered through the human metabolic process, to generate a particular amplitude or frequency of radio waves. Abstractly, I assume the maximum amplitudes and frequency would be subject to improvement through training, under the model of the it being powered by muscular action.

      The ability to disrupt other people's communication (and in particular, only *other* people's) is probably fantastical, yes. But does mean that, in the future when radio technology external to the human body arises, it becomes another thing that could be disrupted, along with audio-hearing and sight.
      ```

        This is really interesting. 

        I was thinking about how difficult it would be to biologically produce currents complicated enough to encode audio information in, but then realized that I was comig at this from the wrong angle. The problem isn't "let's make an organism that can support a literal radio," it's "given an organism that can power two arm antennae and transmit through them: can it develop an effective language?" I think the answer is... *"Maybe?"*

        Firstly, I think the sensitivity functions for humans would be highly variable, depending on arm length (pending a radio expert to confirm this is how antennae work), and may even homogenize height in successful civilizations. Depending on how sharply peaked (i.e. limited to a certain range of frequencies) the sensitivity functions are, you may get isolated settlements being unable to really radiotalk to each other. That would be like finding a group of people who speak in ultrasound!

        Second, if we have dynamically rearrangeable antennae as transceivers... I don't really know enough about radio communication to say anything, but I can imagine you'd get some interesting things happening. I *think* that having frequency modulation happen via arm movement would be the easiest way to get a simple biocircuit to be able to transmit enough information to have a meaningful language. 

        A fun point to think about, if speaking/listening require us to rearrange our antennae, the phrase "body language" takes on a whole new meaning. 

        Maybe some improvement on an individual's loudness and frequency range can be made through practice, but we can only do that with our voices because the system is so deliciously complicated. I fear that an implementation of the current-generating muscles that is complicated enough to work like human voices would be unrealistic to the point of being indistinguishable from a black box. As an aside, I'm under the impression that most researchers are baffled by the cochlea and would love to have a radio equivalent. 

        I'm still geeking out over this and I hate it.

          I choose radio because I know there's things you can or can't do with radio.

          The problem is that I don't know enough physics to lay out the full implication accurately.

          If I were writing a story, I would choose something much less complicated with made-up rules I can reason about, until I become knowledgable with physics.

  If there's one universe begging for fanfiction it's Alan Moore's The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. The setting is a world where literally all fiction is true. ALL OF IT! It's the ultimate crossover universe where any and every story is connected and ripe for rational analysis. The original comic even does it with its reimagining of classic characters and bizarre yet logical background where everything is true.
  ```

  - u/Escapement:
    ```
    I think that having things opened up too much is probably an impediment to fanfiction at *least* as much as it is an aide. Writing in multiversal 'everything including the kitchen sink' settings are a lot like writing original settings - a setting where anything can happen and anyone can turn up, basically contains the same complete absence of information as a featureless void. You have to make the same decisions of what you include, what you don't include, etc. that you would if you were just straight up writing original fiction. Having everything in a setting means your setting is very poorly defined.

    Another setting that does the same sort of thing (multiversal setting that includes everything and has basically no fanfiction) is the Chronicles of Amber (where literally all imaginable worlds exist, including Alice in Wonderland and Arthurian Myth).

  I've been thinking about my vampires a lot this week, though I've never shared anything in a worldbuilding thread before. They're part of a roleplaying universe I co-created, so it's not rational per sae but I like to make it 'as rational as possible'. 

  The vampires are pretty typical, burning in the sun, needing to be invited into human dwellings, etc. They can also create ghouls by feeding them vampire blood, and humans who are fed upon become addicted to the rush of being eaten from, so many vampires keep a 'herd' of humans who are so addicted.

  I've been thinking about their society. I definitely want them to have very rigid customs and social norms, with huge symbolism (e.g. the exact shade of red of the shirt you wear to a meeting has a very particular meaning). They also have a gift-giving culture, where you give gifts to your superiors and inferiors, again with heavy symbolism. For example, a vampire character incorrectly thought someone else was a vampire and gave her a suite of gifts. She didn't accept an ancient warhammer that had belonged to his grandson because she thought it was too extravagant a gift; naturally, the vampire took the refusal of the gift as an indication that she rejects his lineage and does not believe he is able to fight with his own two hands.

  Also, vampires, being better than humans in strength, speed, etc I feel are also naturally better at thinking. They get stronger the older they are, and so I think they should get smarter the older they are.

  With that background, here's my notes on vampire society in general. I'd love any criticism, input, expansions, or corollaries you guys might be able to input. In particular, given how intelligent vampires are, I can't figure out why they haven't just scienced the shit out of everything centuries ago and now we live in a post-singularity world.

  * As vampires are naturally quite vicious and ruthless, prehistoric vampire society was kill or be killed, vicious.

  * As time went on, society became more rigid. Enforced rules of politeness and restraint allowed vampires to function without killing each other.

  * These rules became more and more complicated due to a vampire’s high cognitive capacity, with different shades of meaning encoded in gifts, letters, handwriting, clothing, etc.

  * Part of their dispute resolution process does involve combat. This is because they are stubborn and proud. Usually, the threat of death is enough to make one of the vampires reneg; in fact, that’s generally how these things go. 

  * They tend to have a meritocracy/gerontocracy where the oldest and therefore wisest run the show. As a result, everyone likes to imply that they are older than they are.

  * The rules and mores of vampire society spread easily, as vampires live a long time and have long memories.

  * Vampires have art and music, far beyond anything a mortal can comprehend. One of the most famous vampire-composed operas goes for two straight weeks, and has over a hundred characters. There are shades of foreshadowing and meaning that slowly crystallise together, mostly by the viewer’s own intuition; everything is implied very loosely and delicately.

  * Some vampires are also interested in science; most modern scientific and technological advances were made by vampires, ghouls working on behalf of vampires, or were “accidentally discovered” (penicillin) because of vampires.

    >  In particular, given how intelligent vampires are, I can't figure out why they haven't just scienced the shit out of everything centuries ago and now we live in a post-singularity world.

    They're ancient and mostly set in their ways. With their long lifespans, they don't much *like* change and tend to nostalgically yearn for the "good old days" before all this pollution and overpopulation and other negative consequences of civilisation. While some of them do scientific research, and tend to discover things first, they are reluctant to share these things with mortals (on the basis that mortals already took the internal combustion engine and wrecked the countryside with it).

    Also, humans dramatically outnumber them. A vampire may create an elegant design that works brilliantly and build (say) his own personal supercomputer - but their tendency to secrecy means that he'll only build one, for his own use; he won't build ten thousand and sell them (and hence vampires would never invent the internet). And he'll likely treat it as a mere curiousity, and not share the design with the other vampires (perhaps thinking they'll have more fun figuring out how it was done than if he tells them). Net result? A couple of hundred human scientists communicating and sharing results will outpace any amount of vampires, given long enough. (However, the vampires also get to read the humans' communication, so their technology is consistently about a decade more advanced than what anyone else has got - two decades when it comes to environmental friendliness).

            - u/MagicWeasel:
              ```
              [](/itsnotmyblood) Fortunately, My Vampires Are Different - turning someone into a vampire can't happen by accident. You have to basically open their chest, vomit a weird blood-like paste into their heart, and leave them out of the sun for a day or two in order for it to work. So very few new ones get made, thankfully. It's mostly young ones wanting to create peers so they can hunt in packs for protection from their elders, or vampires who want to keep a friend or lover with them.

              The other big problem I'm having with my vampires is they have three distinct food sources:

              1) People they hunt and kill in the traditional vampirey way

              2) What we've named jannisaries, who are addicted to the experience of being fed on, since it releases endorphins, adreneline, etc in humans. Typical sort of addict personality. They usually continue to live their own lives and just seek the vampire out for scheduled feedings. Some vampires will eat from them unsustainably, but the wisest ones know roughly how much they can get away with taking, though this still shortens the jannisaries life span. 

              3) Ghouls, humans who have been fed vampire blood and gain up to a max of, say, 10% of the vampire's strength/healing ability over the course of several months before reaching a plateau. The vampire blood makes them completely subservient to the vampire. Vampires can feed from ghouls, and though they require a few drops of blood every day or so, canonically, at least, in my mind, a vampire can feed from a ghoul more than often enough to counteract this modest loss.

              What I'm trying to figure out is - why would a vampire not just make a herd of ghouls, keep them in a basement somewhere, and feed from them? Why have jannisaries at all? Jannisarries are uncontrolled, often unpredictable, and have been known to attack vampires to force them to feed. They are a security breach. And yet, vampires for some reason seem to have a lot of them. Ghouls are better in every way.

              Should I just retcon it and say having a ghoul is a net loss of blood, because the amount they must drink to sustain themselves? Or is the logistics of keeping ghouls prohibitive, since you have to bring them human food, dispose of their bodily waste, etc (except, being slaves, you can just order them to do that for themselves)? Does keeping ghouls under control require the use of mental focus that means keeping more than 1 for every 500 years of age you have just takes too much of your brain so you wouldn't be able to control them effectively?

              I tend to lean towards the 'ghouls use psychic energy' school of thought, but it still bugs me.

                [](/raribat) Now, the occasional hunt is a lot of fun, but somewhat risky, So, ideally, one finds a number of people with interesting and *different* flavours to their blood, and turns them into jannisarries. A few jannisarries in a position to stomp on any information leaks - news editors and the like, all well aware that any widespread leaks will lead to them being cut off - will take care of most of the security-breach problem, and their ability to actually think for themselves (unlike ghouls) is vital when they're put in a situation they weren't told how to handle...

                  [](/twidrugs) I love the spirit of your suggestions! However, I probably misrepresented ghouls - they still retain their original personalities and ability to think creatively / etc, and are able to maintain their human lives if the vampire wishes them to. They just become very suggestible, think of a stage hypnotist, and fiercely loyal. It's more like someone who is unconditionally in love with a vampire, than a zombie that has lost its entire personality.

                  I love the idea of the vampire blood altering the taste of the ghoul's blood to make it less palatable, but it's still likely going to be better to have a journalist as a ghoul than as a jannisary.

                  Then again..... a ghoul can be un-ghouled by keeping them away from the vampire for about a week, and they might be disgusted by what they did and turn on the vampire. A jannisary will still be looking for that next high, and while they might sell a vampire out for another vampire's services, there's very little else that would make them want to do so. So, while a jannisary can't be ordered to keep you secret, it's in their interest. On the other hand, a ghoul is bound to you at her very core - until they aren't, and then they are likely to be your biggest enemy. So you would only want to create ghouls you will have complete control over....

In the second case, close friends will no doubt notice the difference.

                  I don't know anything about the science of addition (probably something to research!), but I'd imagine the difficulty would be similar in kind but more severe in magnitude to whatever the 'most addictive'^TM modern drug. So you can get clean with enough effort and support (in fact, a plot line involves a main character trying to do so, though I'm not sure if she succeeds as of yet).

                  However, I'd imagine that jannisaries would for the most part be drug addicts looking for a bigger thrill, so they'd recruit each other (possibly out of a genuine desire to share a better high, possibly because the vampire encourages recruitment), or someone who graduates up the drug scale to the very top (is this a real thing?) and wants something better might seek it out.

                    I don't think "graduating up the drug scale" is a thing just because I've heard of evidence against the existence of gateway drugs. I haven't studied addiction much either, though my impression of it is that after the initial high it's less about seeking out a high and more about feeding an irrational desire. Drug addiction seems to trick the part of our brain designed to incentivize beneficial behavior, so it's very difficult to resist.

                    Additionally, the kind of people who actively seek out drugs to get high probably aren't the kind of people vampires would want to work with. Peons have their uses, but the best people to have in your pocket are the ones who can open doors. Politicians, police officers, lawyers, doctors, businessmen, and professional criminals are all far more useful than random junkies off the street that the cops pay more attention to.

                    I just got an idea for some kind of independent jannisaries. The one advantage peons have is that it's easy to hide regular feeding, for VIPs you need to pay extra for privacy, so many of them could be used like gas stations for whoever is passing by. They're easy to manage and easy to replace. Some may even pay to get bitten as if it were a drug, though the more forward-thinking vamps prefer their food stay financially solvent so they don't have to find more.

  I'm writing a jumpchain fanfic, in major part to try and get used to writing a lot quickly. Would enjoy being used to writing loads, getting into a routine. 

  In the story you are taken to a fictional universes, use point buy to buy various abilities, and live out your life in said universe for several years. I'm trying to work out how they would play out the fairly standard eating pokemon issues- pokemon are clearly smart enough to understand language, handle complex issues, use tools to say, build a playground, and people on occasion consume them. I'm trying to work out how a person would justify that if questioned.

    Whichever way you slice it, eating sentient beings is morally grey at best. That's fine, it gives room for discussion. Most likely everyone will justify it to themselves differently.

    * I refuse adamantly to eat Pokémon and you should too.
    * I refuse adamantly to eat Pokémon but I respect your boundaries.
    * I don't want to eat Pokémon but I don't have the energy to argue about it with you.
    * Nearly everyone else in this world does it, what difference will I make one way or the other?
    * Nearly everyone else in this world does it, I should eat Pokémon to fit in.
    * Nearly everyone else in this world does it, they can't all be wrong.
    * Nearly everyone else in this world does it, so I never really questioned it.
    * Pokémon are not really sentient so it's OK to eat them.
    * I know and accept that this is evil, but they're delicious.
    * I know and accept that this is evil, but I have enough problems of my own without worrying about Pokémon rights as well.

    Basically, just rehash the reasons people think it's OK to eat meat and you'll get most of the possible justifications. That's what this is an obvious allegory for, anyway.

      Thanks, this helps lots. I can flesh out their conversation more.

  First, an apology. The first chapter of *Collateral Damage* was supposed to have been up by August 6th or 9th, to coincide with the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. That simply did not happen. The plot was mostly fine, but it was causing tone whiplash. I'm still deciding if it's salvageable or not.

  The bigger problem is the fact that I still feel like I know nothing about nuclear weapons, their history, properties, or broader things about nuclear physics. Maybe complete accuracy is a terrible standard to impose. I know it doesn't *really* help the story, but I really, really wanted to keep actual, accurate physics in the story, and not only go halfway.

  How do you worldbuild around such complicated topics in a timely manner? How much study and research is "enough" and how do you extract it from history and science books? I feel like someone who tried to walk across a frozen lake, fell through the ice, and drowned.

    Ask someone. I'm not a nuclear engineer, but I'm hoping to start doing research on solar physics in the next few months. I know a little bit more about stellar cores than nuclear bombs, but I may be able to help, or point you in the right direction for what to google. 

    The more niche and specific your questions are, the better.

    The first thing I would recommend for learning nuclear history would be http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/

    I don't know how much research is "enough." There's got to be a cut-off point somewhere. Personally, I would settle for internal consistency. Throw a disclaimer in there somewhere and exclude real nuclear physicists from your intended audience.
