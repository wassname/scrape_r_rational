## [Biweekly Challenge] Megastructures

### Post:

## Last Time

[Last time,](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5ktjoj/biweekly_challenge_the_heist/?sort=confidence) the prompt was "The Heist". The winner was one of our superwinners, /u/zeronihilist, with their story, [With a Little Luck](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5ktjoj/biweekly_challenge_the_heist/dc7fm26/). Go read it now!

##### This Time

This time, the challenge is [**Megastructures**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megastructure#Theoretical). You're free to interpret what scale qualifies, but most of my favorites go really, really big. For inspiration, see [Missile Gap](https://subterraneanpress.com/magazine/spring_2007/fiction_missile_gap_by_charles_stross) by Charles Stross or [Ringworld](https://www.amazon.com/Ringworld-Del-book-Larry-Niven/dp/0345333926) by Larry Niven. The Halo from the Halo series would also qualify, as would a large variety of structures present in the Culture series. It's a fairly common trope in scifi. Remember that prompts are to inspire not to limit; write about technical challenges in building such a thing, the experience of living on one, or whatever else you'd like.

The winner will be decided **Wednesday, January 25th.** You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

##### Rules

* 300 word minimum, no maximum. Post as a link to Google Docs, pastebin, Dropbox, etc. **This is mandatory.**

* No plagiarism, but you're welcome to recycle and revamp your own ideas you've used in the past.

* Think before you downvote.

* Winner will be determined by "best" sorting.

* Winner gets reddit gold, special winner flair, and bragging rights. Five-time winners get even more special winner flair, and their choice of prompt if they want it.

* All top-level replies to this thread should be submissions. Non-submissions (including questions, comments, etc.) belong in the companion thread, and will be aggressively removed from here.

* Top-level replies must be a link to Google Docs, a PDF, your personal website, etc. It is suggested that you include a word count and a title when you're linking to somewhere else.

* In the interest of keeping the playing field level, please refrain from cross-posting to other places until after the winner has been decided.

* No idea what rational fiction is? [Read the wiki!](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index)

##### Meta

If you think you have a good prompt for a challenge, [add it to the list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B6HaZc8FYkr6l6Q4cwBc9_-Yq1g0f_HmdHK5L1tbEbA/edit?usp=sharing) (remember that [a good prompt is not a recipe](http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/prompts?src=RECIPE)). Also, if you want a quick index of past challenges, I've [posted them on the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/weeklychallenge).

##### Next Time

Next time the prompt will be **[Utility Monster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility_monster)**. It's not necessary to go *full* utility monster, but the core concept should ideally revolve around both utilitarian thought and challenges to it from entities which receive more utility per resource than their peers. As always, prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

**Next challenge's thread will go up on 1/25.** Please private message me with any questions or comments. The companion thread [is available here](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5nfxjd/challenge_companion_megastructures/).

  I was interested in exploring a fantasy based megastructure. I was going to continue writing out the end of the story if people were interested. Would probably only be another 1000 ~ 2000 words about the history of the civilization.

    Was there an afterlife? Is she destroying everyone's immortal souls? Or were those things going to die without the bodies anyway?
