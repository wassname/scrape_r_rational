  #Now that I'm 50 chapters in, I'd like to recommend it to anyone looking

  It's somewhat similar to 2YE, but with more emphasis on *discovery* rather than exploiting pre-existing rules, and the scientific method is made use of excellently. It also re-constructs some tropes commonly found in light novels, which is cool.

  ~~It looks interesting just from looking at the summary, but I'm going to sit in this thread and wait for the internet to tell me what to think because I'm currently swamped with fanfiction.~~

    Looks like your standard portal fantasy, in the light novel style. I would also like a summary.

      Industrial revolution, magic style.

      First started with author introducing ideas from his Earth, then spiral to delegation, and eventually a scientific revolution as people think for themselves to come up with new ideas and inventions.

      MC still helps out, but obviously, he's not the only thinker.

      If "it may not be great," then you're going to lose people who have more stories than they have time. If I want portal fantasy, then there are a lot of high-caliber portal stories for me to choose from, so there's no reason for me to pick something average. 

      Besides that, though, the synopsis doesn't sell it to me very well. 

      Stories that are more popular but lower quality may be in different genres than this one and/or have better elevator pitches.

          > Gate!

          Never heard of it. Would this be the anime that comes up if you just google "gate"? AKA the one about the JSDF using modern military tactics and weaponry in the standard feudal monster dimension through the gate that opens up?

          Because that one is looking promising.

          Edit: yeah it's awesome.

          Try /u/eaglejarl 's Two Year Emperor. I think you need to buy it now, but I really enjoyed it while reading it. Despite the main character being OP as hell, his enemies are still threatening enough for there to be dramatic tension.

            It's available free on [my Patreon](http://Patreon.com/davidstorrs), along with one of my other novels.

          In Portal Fantasy specifically, books on my to-read list include: 

          * *The Magicians*, by Lee Grossman. 

          Neil Gaiman has a number of books that qualify. *Erfworld* is... good, but I can't say whether it's better than *A Hero's War*, because it's not top-caliber. Definitely a better elevator pitch, though. 

          If you're okay with fanfiction, then the Discworld fic *Slipping Between Worlds* is also on my list. 

          I'm not sure how many people are looking specifically for rationalist Portal Fantasy. If that's what you're meaning, then the explanation is likely that most people are just looking for high-caliber r!fic in general. In that case there's a good list at TV Tropes, but I'd suggest anything by Scott Alexander, and r!Animorphs.

  I'm on chapter 8, and I find this really compelling. The overall plot isn't ridiculously original, but I really like the execution. I think this is genuinely good.
  ```

  I've read all the chapters. It's very good. Much better than I expected based on the synopsis. World building is good, nobody really holds the idiot ball, the industrial revolution is well described and the steps taken are logical. 

  I'm going to look forward to this as much as much as I'm looking forward to new chapters of the Tinker's Daughter, Mother of Learning and Contact 1955.

  Closest to this would be Two Year Emperor (but that has more a DnD munchkining focus).
