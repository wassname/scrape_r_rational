  After almost four years, I'm finally closing the book on Orders of Magnitude, with a Christmas Day release of

  * The rewritten final chapter (which had been inadvertently reverted to a previous, unfinished version)
  * An epilogue
  * 30 pages of Author's Notes to explain what the hell is going on.

  Damn I somehow missed this one. Well, I know what I'm gonna be reading the next few days.

  I binged this story in two days and I think it's an incredible story. Reading it gave me the same experience of reading *Significant Digits* or HPMOR for the first time. And like those I will definitely come back and re-read it in the future.

  I definitely look forwards to reading your other works, including *The Longest Day* and anything you write in the future!
