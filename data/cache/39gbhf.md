## [Q] Optimal Evil in Evil Schemes

### Post:

So I'm brainstorming a magical girl fic that as opposed to Middle Schoolers in close knit groups in their various hometowns, its more of a JROTC & College Prep academy where the big one has come and gone and new students are taught to be model citizens and work in groups as opposed to training for the fate of the earth. Our lead got in on a scholarship when she transmuted her dying brother's soul into a stuffed animal, and her antag is an unknown entity being all dark and ominous and nebulous, transmuting people into stone when she wants to send a message and playing with memories and social dynamics when she doesn't. 

Eventually, jig is up and she's revealed to be a core member of the group, a kind of cleric who is pissed that even in a world of super science and magic that can better unite the world, we still hate and piss all over each other for the crimes of being humans, so she denounces her "god," and plans a megaspell to petrify everyone on Earth and Lotus Eater them into their own delusions of grandeur. 

 How evil and/or sympathetic do I make this character, and what should be the mechanics of her Lotus Eater megaspell? I want her to be clever enough to be able to fool everyone into thinking that she's innocent, but I still want enough humanity in her to be able to almost get behind the idea of her removing agency from everyone else on Earth because she can't stand others fighting. Outside of the obvious "Am I doing this right, does this sounds fun." I figured I'd ask around about if the system needs to be more explicitly flawed, driving people to madness if they've been bad, isolation and depression for people not creative enough to dream up something that can entertain them for an eternity. Or is it enough for the lead to be against that plan because it would mess up the antagonist for life, doesn't want her to be the one to make that choice for everyone, and/or that sort of society terrifies her?

  Good vs. Good is almost always more compelling.

  My suggestion would be to have the Lotus Eater megaspell be perfect. You want the reader to *almost* feel some sympathy for the villain, especially if they're a known character who already has some sympathy. The petrification is terrifying, until it's revealed that the person that's petrified is living a life of bliss, and then it's just unsettling. (My personal suggestion, knowing nothing about the magic, is that you can play up your themes by having someone become unpetrified and *beg* to go back to the life they'd had as a person of stone.)

  The question then becomes one of free will, consent, and the nature of what's real, all of which are good things for a protagonist and antagonist to be fighting over, because there's not really a right answer. Introducing flaws to the petrification is just putting your thumb on the scale, and there's not really a need to do that.

    Ok, really?  There's not really a right answer?  So, just non-hypothetically, should /u/xamueljones be programming that FAI he's working on to go ahead and turn Lotus Matrix Lord on us?  Or at least, are you claiming a sufficient lack of right answers that it would be *acceptable* for him to do so?

      Well I don't think so, but I've seen enough people arguing for CelestAI as a hero to know that opinion isn't universal. And I'm not so sure they're wrong that I'm willing to call that position unconscionable.

      Edit: Same with *Ra* and [Ra spoilers](#s " the virtuals vs the actuals"). Much to /u/sam512's seeming consternation, there was a vocal contingent of people arguing that the sensible thing was for [Ra spoilers](#s " the virtuals to forcibly upload the actuals, who would be none the wiser, and much happier for it").

        See, I'd be willing to buy the Lotus Lord position if someone could provide *definitive* reasons why moral reality *can be no other way*, and why there's no genuinely preferable alternative action for someone *trying to do good* other than to Lotusify people.

        Like, with a misprogrammed AI, ok, the AI has an autistic fixation on this one *fiction*, due to its programming.  I buy that it is motivated to fulfill the fixation which was programmed into it.  But that fixation on a work of fiction is not a *moral position* -- it's not related to what people prefer for themselves and others on full information and reflection.  It's basically just the fic's author inserting a conceit to help him show why programming AIs with harmless-sounding utility function is a Really Bad Idea.

        So, like, a Lotus Lord *could* just try *improving real life* if they *didn't* have some programmed-in fixation on a dream world of some kind.  They could work to alleviate poverty, mediate political conflicts, fight gang violence, and just generally make living a rich, full life more preferable than taking drugs or any metaphor for taking drugs.  In fact, with reality-warping, superintelligence, massive mana reserves, or any other commonly-attributed villain power, they'd have an easy time of it.

        Or hell, they could just offer the dream-world *without the brainwashing, memory erasure, and compulsion*.  [There's a decent argument that a *mediated* dream-experience *which is understood to be mediated* is closer to reality-as-such than an unmediated but low-tech delusional worldview.](http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2015/01/16/on-the-design-of-escaped-realities/)

        But somehow I'm supposed to believe we have some radical, Knightian uncertainty that makes these villains really sympathetic.

          I agree in the case of a general AI setting goals.

          The strongest argument I've seen in favor of virtualizing everyone is that human bodies use up resources that would be better spent on computation, which isn't all that strong of an argument, and doesn't mean that everyone has to be in a "fake" version of reality (because there are layers of mediation).

          However, in a fictional world you can bypass a lot with your conceit. In the OP's magical girl example, it might not be *possible* to use the power in another way; if your only tool is a spell that petrifies people and throws them into their version of Heaven, then there aren't questions of using that power in another way. This is *slightly* cheesy, in that your audience will see the conflict of choice that you've set up, but like a good hypothetical question, you can cut out the parts that are irrelevant to what you want to discuss.

            That and it's not really an AI so much as it is a dumb magical happy machine that's sole purpose is to keep the mind happy and occupied while the body is a rock. Bit of a semantics issue, but the magic would more or less turn on the happy leaving the brain to figure out its new reality. Not that its nailed down, as I roll over pretty easily in these kind of discussions, but it's what I intended to go with to try and avoid "Why doesn't the Magical Computer do this instead" question.

                I guess? Never heard of it before hand, but I suppose it is a little closer, but with elements of both. Mentioned in one of the other posts that I'm not sure of the difference of a sufficiently fulfilling lotus machine and just pouring on the happy if it could indulge everyone of every constructive and destructive desire with no consequence, so I might go back and forth. The mechanics is that the spell forces the brain to do a lot of the heavy lifting when it comes to constructing a dream scenario the person happy, so maybe a little of both if not one or the other.

  Ok, see, now I feel like this concept needs to be parodied.  Ruthlessly.  *With ponies*.

  The Great and Powerful Trixie decides to cast the entirety of Equestria into a Lotus Eating Bliss with some lost artifact or another -- because there's just too much fighting and pain in the world (by which we mean, because Trixie found out Twilight Sparkle became an alicorn princess and is jealous).  Someone-or-other has to go out and stop her.

  It would just be *funny* to read about some character *so incredibly emo-kid* that they feel a need to go Lotus Lord on a sugar-bowl setting.

  EDIT: Obviously the lost artifact should be called the Black Lotus.

  I'm going to dissent: Ideological Evil, evil with *ideas*, is a more interesting conflict than Good vs Good.  You can only mess-up Good so much before it becomes Neutral or Evil anyway.

  >I still want enough humanity in her to be able to almost get behind the idea of her removing agency from everyone else on Earth because she can't stand others fighting.

  I'm sorry, but this sounds kinda... cliched.  It could work really well if executed well, but that's a fairly big *if*.

  For one thing, if you make your villain motivated by Free Will Makes Suffering, you end up with your heroines having to defend *precisely* the shittiest conduct of regular people as a matter of principle regarding Free Will.  This is despite the fact that most regular people would probably say "yes" to a "morality pill" (that conformed to their notion of morality, or even that used a fully naturalized grounding for its morality) that lets you do things like control yourself better and make better choices.

  It's also irritating to get to a Final Battle between such a villain and the heroines, and all of a sudden the heroines are motivated by making a more moral, less shitty world *without* violating Free Will, *when they never had any such motivation before and are really just rationalizing the status quo* (paging *Slayers Try*).  Then the giant Eldritch Abomination Kriemhild Gretchen (or Jasmine, whatever) is killed, the Lotus Eating megaspell is broken... and everything goes back to normal, *proving the villain right*.

  If you want to make a conflict about Free Will, you can't leave it as "Anti-Freedom villain versus sinful but pro-Freedom heroines."  You need genuinely *good* people to hold up the cause of Freedom *on principle* rather than *because they'd rather keep being shitty people*.

  If your conflict winds up with the Evil Law Firm of Satan sending a note to the heroes saying, "Thanks for averting world peace.  That really could've put us out of business", then the heroes'/heroines' side of the moral conflict was irrational.

    I think that I might be confused on the distinction between "Ideological Evil" and "Good". Is ideological evil just following some ideology that someone else has declared to be evil? Or is it being "evil" in pursuit of some idea that most other people agree with?

      > Or is it being "evil" in pursuit of some idea that most other people agree with?

      Well, I think that's just called being ruthless in pursuit of a cause, and it's been done by self-proclaimed Good Guys since ever.

      >Is ideological evil just following some ideology that someone else has declared to be evil?

      I think I would phrase Ideological Evil as, "believes in his/her capital-I Ideology more thoroughly, with greater normative weight in terms of deciding his/her actions, than in what the audience will recognize as commonsense morality."

      Ends of spectrum: unpopular public policy (mere I Did What I Had To) ... Nazis (Ideological Evil to the nth degree).  And I really mean it about the Nazis: they were the ones who mis-paraphrased Nietzsche to claim that Jews invented morality to enslave the stronger races.  An Ideological Evil character believes that morality, as a category or concept, *should* be discarded, and gives their ideology as the reason.

        Well that seems like a fairly useless measure considering the vast range of both potential readers and their own ever changing moral system.

          There's always *some* moral uncertainty, but frankly when it comes to evil overlords there's not a lot.  We all know that gassing the Jews, kicking puppies, and raping prisoners are evil.  Or at least, we all know these things are evil *in stories*, because our entire previous literary consumption has built up the association.

            Oh, certainly. Everyone agrees that Quirrel from *HPMoR*, CelestAI, the Virtuals, any incarnation of Lex Luthor, Ozymandias from *Watchmen*, Andrew Ryan from *Bioshock*, Skitter from *Worm*, and Hyperintelligent Rainbow Dash from that one fanfic last week, are morally irredeemable supervillains. Nobody has ever suggested that such characters were not in the wrong.

            /s

            The author's intent may be clear, but just because you can accurately judge whether a character is a villain or not doesn't mean most people can.

              You rather spoiled your sarcasm by including at least one example of *deliberate* ambiguity.  Alan Moore was damn well intending that we should sympathize with Ozymandias.  Oh, and since this is my flair and it's mandatory here, AKEMI HOMUCIFER DID NOTHING WRONG.

              And Quirrellmort from canon!HPMoR doesn't really belong on the list anymore, since he didn't get to do much Evil Overlording, at least as he was, before getting permakilled by an 11-year-old kid.  Following the Phoenix's Quirrellmort at least managed to start a major war ;-)!

              Oh, and I didn't read the thing with Hyperintelligent Rainbow Dash because it was boring.  So I can't judge other than having heard the ranting complaint on this sub that it was a textbook case of Genius Makes You Evil, in which case it's clearly Author Fiat interfering with how alignments normally work.

              Oh, and basically *everyone* in Bioshock is an evil villain.  It's an all-villains game about all the nastiest scummy ideas the 20th century vomited up.

    I agree with all of this.

    Consider a group of people turned to stone will live indefinitely (especially if the magic can be altered to ensure it). So there will be no death or disease any longer. There is no real need to have people's fantasies isolated from each other either. So the character that cast this spell can do so from some very good motives.

    Those who want to stop them must do so because they believe that free choices that change the real world are better than living a false life. More importantly, they have to defend this even though people are dying, sick or violent.

    If anything, I think that the job of the heroes is actually a lot harder. After all, the villain is really offering a critique of current society and the hero. Their claim is that the hero is really only interested in preserving the status quo and that they are the real hero instead. The "hero" is really just a punch-clock villain ready to defend their ordinary lives. So the hero needs to show that this critique is either wrong OR they need accept it and change their behavior.

      I don't want to immediately shut you down by saying that is not how the made up magic works, but I kinda wanted to explore the idea of solipsism heaven verses our collective reality, and the villain in question doesn't want shared experiences as either it may break the illusion, open up the harrassment issues we have in current society, or expose how nasty we truly are to one another once there is no barrier between our thoughts and other.

  Ooh, you can transform people into other things and their sould are attatched to them? There are opportunities for some *excellent* transhumanist things there, even if there are drawbacks.

  I think you're right; the "villain" is *too* right. Destroying or preventing Utopia because *freedom!* is a well-worn cliche, and (IMO) incredibly unsympathetic in a protagonist. On the other hand, you don't want to give them a good plan and then bolt on a stupid downside.

  Here's my suggestion: there's no Matrix. The Petrified don't dream, and they certainly don't live in a perfect Lotus Eater world. Rather, they're fully conscious, but blind, deaf, and dumb - and their soul/mind has been altered so their preferences are OK with staring at darkness forever. (This would allow AlexanderWales' excellent suggestion of depetrifying someone at some point.)

    Guess so. The brother is a bit of a Pinocchio where it's inconclusive if he his the lead's brother in the form of an animated stuffed animal, or a representation of his sisters thoughts and memories with a new kernel tossed in. Think FMA if Al was never sure if there was a difference between Al and the Almor. His body is in stone storage though until it can be cured, and the cat memories could always be transfered back in, but he tries not to dwell on the identity thing and just be a supportive brother who is also a stuffed cat. 

    The petrification spell is an entirely different animal though, that locks you in your body, keeps you alive and turns on whatever makes you happy. I don't know if there is more than a semantic difference between "whatever makes you happy" and "making whatever happy," but I'm willing to hear you out if you have a good reason as to why one works better than the other for long term happy making.
