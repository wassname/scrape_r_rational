## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  Are there any good works that explore the idea of 'looking for wiggle room in ambiguously-worded prophecies', subverting the usual 'self-fulfilling prophecy' trope? So when the king's oracle foretells that his first born son will kill him, grinding his mighty stone walls to dust, instead of ordering his trusted guard to drown the hapless child in the nearby river, he focuses on forging an unbreakable bond of love and respect with the child, fostering in them a passion for chess and euthanasia, and ushering into their kingdom an era of peace, prosperity, and air superiority such that their fortifications are really quite unnecessary and rather block the view.

    Have you tried the oft recommended [Just a Bystander](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/32123/just-a-bystander)? The central conceit is about subverting prophecies, and much of the story is about the mechanics of how these ambiguous prophecies are made and enforced and fulfilled. 

    I will admit to having lost interest recently, but I fully intend to catch up eventually.

    Subverting prophecy is a key element in the Harry Potter fanfic [Blood Crest](https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10629488/1/Blood-Crest).

    The author has created neat worldbuilding about divination, especially in recent chapters. Basically, the act of performing divination is equivalent to collapsing eigenstates. Before divination a person's fate is fluid, but 'finding out' their fate through divination causes it to become fixed. Like in your request, the specific details mentioned in a prophecy cannot be averted, but any circumstances not mentioned in the prophecy can still be altered for a better outcome. This has interesting ethical implications such that practitioners are discouraged from performing the types of divination that give the most precise or far-reaching answers.

        I found it simultaneously painful and boring.  As someone who relatively rarely drops a fic, I couldn't finish it.
        ```

      - u/gramineous:
        ```
        The most notable features of the fic are how uniquely the "dark magic" is designed, and how different characters have different opinions on the rules and underlying nature of magic as a whole, which is presented with ambiguity as to what is "correct." Other than that, everything else about the work is pretty much unremarkable, and I wouldn't begrudge anyone their criticism of the work as a whole, since that make-up of specific strengths and general mediocrity isn't to everyone's tastes. I got up to date with it quickly after it got mentioned here a few months back, and go and read the new stuff every few weeks, but I'm always interested in individual ideas in the things I read more than a single cohesive work.
        ```

      - u/chiruochiba:
        ```
        In my opinion it's a great story that would be enjoyable even for people who aren't familiar with Harry Potter canon. The plot of the fic diverges significantly from events in the orginal books, so  people who are bored by canon rehashes should also find it interesting.

  [Conquest of Avalon](https://conquestofavalon.wordpress.com/2021/01/18/fernan-i-the-scout/) is worth a look, for anyone who wants political intrigue with magic and stuff. Synopsis:

  > Seventeen years past, the Kingdom of Avalon invaded the Empire of the Fox from across the sea and conquered its capital, Malin, sending its rulers fleeing to the city of Guerron. The strange new technologies of the distant kingdom triumphed even over the power of the spirits, killing the Fox King and thousands along with him.
  > 
  > Though time has brought with it peace, resentments have only grown in the wake of this War of the Foxtrap. Refugees defiantly dream of the day they can retake their homeland as nobles plot behind closed doors, even knowing it would mean another war. Until then, those of Guerron must put forward a friendly face, plying Avalon with tribute and trade, lest the Kingdom resume its ambitions of conquest.

    Thanks! I've thought about posting it here but I wasn't sure it really qualified as rational fic. 

    Looking at the sidebar again though, I do think that the examination of motives and thoughtful worldbuilding apply, or at least they're meant to, and there are some deconstructive elements too, so it's actually a decent fit.

    How do you feel it compares to PGtE?
    ```

    - u/Husr:
      ```
      They haven't read PGTE so I'll weigh in. I'm the author of CoA though, so that's worth keeping in mind for this. 

      Premise wise, despite both starting after the main country lost a war, it's pretty different. CoA doesn't have the same narrativium logic of the guide, nor (so far) have the main characters ended up working all that closely for or with the conquering nation. 

      The main magic system involves bargaining with spirits largely disinterested in humanity to obtain a share of their power in exchange for sacrifices made to them, which I guess is loosely similar to some of the Praesi magic traditions, but it's a much greater focus here. 

      Rather than outwitting the story to win, it's about outwitting people (which guide does have too, obviously). 

      Perspective is also a much larger focus. There are multiple main characters, and through each other's eyes the reader gets a fairly good idea about where they're being unreliable or biased narrators, or how they come off in a way they didn't intend to, etc. PG has that ocasionally in some interludes but it's not super common. 

      As far as quality, again keeping in mind who you're hearing this from, I think it's so far maybe a stronger start than Book 1 of guide, which I found a bit weak honestly, but not yet as good guide at its book 2-3 peak. But quality is also the thing I'm least qualified to talk about objectively, again.

  It's hard to figure out how to recommend this book without spoilers - in principle it's dungeon core litrpg, but extremely atypical - but [A Lonely Dungeon](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/37231/a-lonely-dungeon) is one of the most moving completed short novels that I can remember seeing on Royalroad.  Content warning, contains kindness.

  The in-progress and entirely different novel set in the subsequent world/aftermath, [An Unbound Soul](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/38292/an-unbound-soul), is slightly more central litrpg but still high on my to-read list.  I cannot recall any other work that made me feel so sympathetic towards >!planetary mind control!<.  It is just giving a really fair shake to >!the reason why an entity would resort to that, the good they could do if they weren't human and didn't act like an asshole, the desirable outcome that you could plausibly get at least in the short term, the shivers that would still obtain in that case, and the degree to which the mind-controller \*isn't\* stereotypically-villain ultraconfident that they're doing the right thing!<.

  [Vigor Mortis](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/40373/vigor-mortis) is just getting started but high on my watch list.  There is kindness in this, and in [Beware of Chicken](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/39408/beware-of-chicken).

  [Sexy Space Babes](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/37934/sexy-space-babes) is some nice /r/HFY porn, oh, plus some actual porn too.

  Lately archive-binged Beneath The Dragoneye Moons, Chrysalis, and Magic-Smithing.  Can't give a strong rec, could give a weak one if you need something to fill you up.

      I read the entirety of volume one, and while I see why Eliezer said "there is kindness in this," I found the pro-slaughter propaganda to be quite heavy-handed. It was chock full of heavy rationalization and devaluation of "normal" animals, leaning on all of the old familiar semantic stopsigns that people use to justify this particular bit of unnecessary cruelty to themselves.

      The most heart-wrenching bit for me was when the rooster, in an effort to come to terms with what is happening on the farm, joins in this same mental campaign against his own kind to avoid thoughts conflicting with the wishes of his master.

      Should non-cultivator humans be treated the same way, since they too lack the "spark"? What about non-cultivator dogs?

      It's easy to criticize fantasy settings based in ancient civilizations as being a bit rapey, or to laud the MC's avoidance of a life of unnecessary and brutal conflict, but it's a lot harder to shine that same awareness on our own culture. This story fails hard at the latter, and so it fails to be truly kind.

    > Sexy Space Babes is some nice /r/HFY porn, oh, plus some actual porn too.

    The premise seems at odds with it being /r/HFY, since it seems to be that there are superhuman aliens doing things better than humans.  Is this a fakeout or something else? From the preview blurb.

    >Not only had the aliens conquered Earth with almost trivial ease, the seven-foot purple amazons also had the audacity to start running the planet better than Humanity ever had.
    ```

    - u/Dragfie:
      ```
      Nah, definitely HFY just much more realistic to the setting: humans being the underdeveloped civ in the universe and the aliens are physically bigger. All the things which would HAVE to be true in such a setting are while anything that the author can find the slightest excuse for humans being better at they are. (e.g. humans can out-box aliens twice their size cos of their... Endurance and agility?) 

      Other than that soft dig its a pretty good HFY IMO.
      ```

    - u/CronoDAS:

    Seconding Beware of Chicken. That and [Dark Skies](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/32807/dark-skies) (which is about to restart after its end-of-volume hiatus, and already has on Patreon) are the updates I look forward to most currently.
    ```

- u/Do_Not_Go_In_There:
  ```
  I just finished *The Commonwealth Saga* by Peter F Hamilton (made up of [*Pandora's Star*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45252.Pandora_s_Star) and [*Judas Unchained*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45244.Judas_Unchained)). I liked it, but I'd give it a cautious recommendation. It's a pretty interesting story that deals with what humans (and human society) becomes one given almost unlimited resources and lifespan, as well as massive technology advancements. It was interesting and fun to read, but I fell it really didn't stick the landing.

  The story is kind of a mix of several genres: it's a mystery/spy thriller military space opera. In essence, an alien race is found to have created two Dyson spheres (habitats around stars) to either trap or protect the inhabitants of two stars, and the Commonwealth (the star-spanning human government) sends a ship to investigate (going by the title it's pretty obvious what happens).

  There's a mix of different character from different backgrounds, including:

  * a genetically modified detective who has tracking down a doomsday cult for 130 years

  * a Physicist who invented wormhole travel

  * a die-hard Socialist who wants a galactic revolution to overthrow the elite upper class (he also is part of the cult)

  * a reporter who stumbles across a government conspiracy

  * an astronaut who found himself out of a job the day wormhole tech was revealed (which also happens to be the day he and his crew set foot on Mars).

  and a dozen others. They were all well-written, with their motivations and characters well developed.

  The worldbuilding is really on point in the story. Hamilton spends a lot of the book developing the Commonwealth, and really making it seem something people would come up with. What's most interesting is how human society evolves and splinters as different philosophies are given room to expand, since people have access to hundreds of planets, if they don't like their old society they can just move to a new one and set up their own society. There are planets that cut themselves off from the Commonwealth, not wanting to be part of a large government, a planet where the people are genetically modified to fit certain roles in society, a planet where human modification is taken to extremes, one where people live in a medieval lifestyle, planets that are owned by corporations/rich families, and more.

  Humanity as well changes one people discover how to download memories, grow entire new bodies, and implant those memories. You can now choose how "old" you are, which isn't necessary your true age. There are people in the hundreds going around in bodies of a 20 year old. Marriage becomes more of a social contract, as rarely will anyone stay with the same partner for 200 years. Families become huge, since your greatx6-grandfather can still have kids, with each generation having their own children. Death becomes debateable, since someone only truely dies if their memories are wiped. There's a new form of (basically) craddle-robbing, where people who are on the *n*th life (n>1) date some who is on their 1st life. Does upward mobility exist in a society where people can live forever, and plan to live forever, and accumulate wealth as they do?

  The one part I didn't like was the ending; after building up the story for so long, having people fight and struggle to survive and finally coming up with a solution that >!will save humanity from an invading alien (basically a virus with nukes) that wants to exterminate them, and cannot be reasoned with and will never stop, one of the characters decides "screw it, I'm doing this my way because what you guys are doing will make me feel bad. It's a massive risk that might not work and might even lead to humanity's destruction, but I'll save everyone, even the alien, you'll see!" And as if by magic, it works, and this grand betrayal is never punished in any way.!< 

  The ending just leave me feeling bitter because it could have worked. But didn't. The book spends the entire time showing that >!one of the characters goes on a voyage to find out the truth of the alien prison, and actually manages to find it. But he simply learns redundant information, stuff we already learn from a secondary source. He could just as easily have learned how to turn the prison back on and trap the alien without killing it, but doesn't get that info, and so runs off on a half-baked scheme of saving everyone.!< It's just disappointing because it came so close but missed the mark.

  It's still a very good (and very long) story, and I'd recommend it, just be warned that you might not like the ending.
  ```

  - u/N0_B1g_De4l:
    ```
    Even if you don't read the whole story, the bit that introduces the Primes and MorningLightMoutain works very well as a standalone short story. I could never get into the series as a whole, but I really enjoyed that particular part of it.
    ```

  - u/duffmancd:
    ```
    Seconding the recommendation, and the complaint about the ending.

    But the world building is great, and Judas Unchained has my favourite augmented-human vs augmented-human fight of all fiction. That scene alone ruined Elysium (the film) for me, you would have thought that with Hollywood's money they could do better than two dudes punching each other with a few jumps thrown in. Hamilton gets it right.

  Hey folks.I wanted to ask about Wildbow's *Pale* - mainly, is it any good? And if so, *is it comparable to Worm?!*

  Worm remains my favourite story of all time despite finishing it years ago.  I read all of Ward as well 2x a week back when it was still being written and it was OK overall, but I was pretty exhausted by the end of it and a little sad it never really delivered the excitment factor I was hoping for. So I decided to take a break from Wildbow's work for a while. 

  So, is it as good as Worm?  Or am I better off pursuing a different web serial (like the Wondering Inn or something).... 

  I had a look over at r/parahumans while carefully avoiding spoilers and the sentiment for Pale seemed positive, but I wanted to get more of an unbiased opinion before I jump into another epic story.

  Two weeks ago someone recommended [A City Stranded Cowboy's Robot Mercy Killing Business](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/29027/a-city-stranded-cowboys-robot-mercy-killing-business) and I'm here to second it. The protagonists have a device that detects suffering, which they found in a dumpster. They discover that some people have built simulated worlds so they can torture the inhabitants, so they use this device to go around fixing those worlds, and murder whoever built them. This is mostly an excuse for the characters to go places, and the story is much more about how the cast respond to each other and the world they live in.

  The energy is very much what you'd normally expect out of a crack fic. The genre might be "parody of political parodies." I'm pretty sure a couple of the side characters are sentient crows and nobody has noticed. It's often uproariously funny.
  ```

  - u/DangerouslyUnstable:
    ```
    I'm not caught up yet, and am still reading, but I think this one may be very much up to individual tastes. Every comment I have seen about it has been overwhelmingly positive, and yet my experience, after the first bit, is kind of "eh". The over the top ridiculousness of the characters and their environment just doesn't quite do it for me, at least not to the extent it does for many people on this sub (evidently, based on the comments). 

    I really enjoyed the beginning that was more focused on the premise of "find simulated torture universes, kill perpetrator", but as it evolved to be more and more focused on the characters and their relationships, it has been slowly losing my interest. There is nothing I can point to as being "bad" per se, which leads me to my belief that it's probably a good story, but that it just doesn't quite match my personal preferences, and in a subtle enough way that I don't think I can even articulate why, other than a general feeling that it's a bit too over-the-top for me, even though that's very clearly intentional on the part of the author. 

    It might be that the characters all seem like caricatures of real people in ways that are supposed to be illuminating, but to me just come off as overdone.
    ```

    - u/jtolmar:
      ```
      I think that's very fair. It's definitely not going to be everyone's cup of tea. I'm hoping my review above makes it clear that the story really isn't about the simulated torture premise.

      To overexplain what I think is the core recurring joke of the story: Throwing a bunch of over the top cliche characters at a political allegory doesn't result in any meaningful statement being made. But anyone else who set this up would try to make an actual statement, so I keep expecting the author to try. But that's dumb, so he doesn't. This subverts my expectations so it's funny.

      Also I'd quite happily replace any character that's a thinly disguised copy of Spock with one that's a thinly disguised copy of Junji.

      > I really enjoyed the beginning that was more focused on the premise of "find simulated torture universes, kill perpetrator"

      I think there's a lot of potential for a story that follows this concept and takes it more seriously. I'd be worried it might just devolve into torture porn (something I'm very glad the work as-is does not do), but I could imagine this framing being used to explore much more philosophically complex universes. Beings with radically different pain stimuli, different mind structures, beings that require the pain of others to not feel pain themselves, a universe with that guy Yudkowsky wants to torture so a googleplex people won't get a sand in their eye, utilitarian gotchas like the repugnant conclusion, that sort of thing.

  So a year ago my best friend and I got into musicals, we watched the 25th anniversary concert of Les Misérables which was amazing and we enjoyed a lot despite it not being the kind of thing we usually watch (at least for me, I hated musical episodes in cartoons when I was a kid and growing up all the plays and musicals I was exposed to were very mediocre highschool productions, so I didn't have the best impression of them).

  Someone in this sub recommended [The Guy Who Didn't Like Musicals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrxKX44qBJ0), which we absolutely loved, and later on we also watched [Black Friday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqt4_tHLSB4) and [Firebringer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmVuNlu0LCk) which were great too.

  Those got us to keep an eye out for other musical stuff, and so we ended up watching Hamilton and Death Note: The Musical. I think so far Hamilton has the soundtrack I have listened to the most, which surprised me because I don't usually like that kind of music genre. As for the Death Note Musical? I think it's amazing, as far as live action adaptations go it's probably the best one so far, with the dorama as a kinda close second. I kind of pair up Hamlton and Death Note together because they feel similar in some aspects despite being wildly different, there is a lot of thought put behind each song and a lot of details you might not get unless you look for them. Btw the Death Note musical is available as an english soundtrack (it's on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xf5erBVHdXY&list=PLm_hcPaCSyIau7IZGAFvc0z1nT1pn8w4U&index=2)) and as a japanese adaptations of that english soundtrack (not available anywhere really, but someone named Theatre Josh might have it, if you look him up).

  The only derec I would make is for Jekyll & Hyde, again [great soundtrack](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8aTJAOtVIufXs8hrYOq0Hq-Pc7wsG7i9), but the adaptation (from 2001) for it abridged some of the best songs (they did Alive dirty) and David Hasselhoff's acting was uhh, something. I probably should clarify that I'm not from the US and with the pandemic going on seeing stuff live isn't an option, so I'm only judging what I can get my hands on online.

  Anything else y'all would recommend? We're holding off on watching Starkid's Twisted which I know was recommended here before because neither of us has seen Aladdin in forever, I figured having context for it might make for a better watch? I don't know if it's actually required though.
  ```

  - u/gazemaize:
    ```
    You won't miss much from Twisted by not having rewatched Aladdin first, they spell out most of the referential humor for those who haven't seen it in awhile (or ever). The stage musical version of Aladdin is also great, if you want to experience it in that format instead of seeing the movie again.

    Wicked was the inspiration for Twisted and is excellent. Based on what you mentioned, I would also recommend Beetlejuice, Groundhog Day, Something Rotten, Newsies, Chicago, Waitress, and Natasha, Pierre, and the Great Comet of 1812.
    ```

  - u/chiruochiba:
    ```
    I recomend checking out Sondheim's musicals. The original Broadway cast recording of *Into the Woods* is phenomenal - one of my all time favorites. You can watch it on [youtube](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=kqCsQCsinK4). *Sweeney Todd* is also an excelent drama with great music, though I don't know of any stage production recordings to recomend.
    ```

  - u/RegnarFle:
    ```
    You might also want to watch the song '[Bonjour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAzxnHP4erQ)' from beauty and the beast on youtube before watching Twisted.

    &#x200B;

    All of gazemaize's recommendations are my favourites, so watch those first.

    Less about fantasy and more real-life (ish) musical soundtrack recommendations are [Catch me if you can](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYr6mmo3zXrnGPUKqftkdeB4NNEQGIG8M) (about a con man) and [Chess](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLF9C08C4CE52FB7F1). While I haven't seen the musicals, the soundtracks alone have gotten me through many many many hours of chores.

    Other Starkid shows I really enjoyed are 'ANI: a parody' (if you've seen star wars), and Starship (which is a parody of my little mermaid + space operas, also with bug puppets).

    Starkid's A Very Potter Musical (+ AVPS + AVPSY) did make me laugh a lot  (if you're familiar with Harry Potter). If Batman/Justice League of America was about frat boys, then Holy Musical Batman would be the end result.

    If dark humour and teenagers are watchable topics for you, try EMO the musical. Heathers: the musical is also in the same vein, but with more >!murder !<and a rockin' soundtrack. Most productions don't include my [favourite song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLA04_ukN4Y), so here it is.

    Also If you like your teenagers with a zombie apocalypse and a LOT of gore, Anna and the Apocalypse is on Netflix\* (note: VERY GORY. LOTS OF GORE).

    If you want something more lighthearted and family-friendly, I recommend Legally Blonde (musical), Shrek the musical (on netflix\*), and Hairspray (netflix),.

    I hope you enjoy!

    \*please note: when I say netflix above, I mean netflix Canada. No idea if it's the same in other countries

      chiming in with a counter-rec to say I personally really didn't like Anna and the Apocalypse. On a premise level it had a huge amount of potential, but the songwriting was flat and the character writing was poor, imo. Felt like I'd wasted my time when I finished watching it. This sub would have a particularly bad time with it, I think
      ```

  - u/TridentTine:
    ```
    IMO after TGWDLM Twisted is Starkid's best one. There's also [Spies are Forever](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlF0gFzOX4tD1KJ5ZEnvhD55Qhnz-K0X2) with some Starkid actors, which is good.

    With Twisted I wouldn't say you need to know much about Aladdin specifically beyond the Wikipedia plot summary, although Starkid do reference a few things from Disney in general.

    If you watch it it would help to know that Disney bought Pixar in 2006 for $7.4 billion, after Pixar's animated movies had been massively outperforming Disney's efforts since Toy Story. There was some conflict between Jobs (yes, of Apple - he was also CEO of Pixar apparently) and Eisner, which resulted in Eisner being voted out in no-confidence by Disney's shareholders before the relationship with Pixar was repaired leading to the purchase. No, that's not a spoiler, it just aids understanding :)

    if you liked Guy Who Didn't, your tastes probably aren't tooo far from mine: my favourite is Groundhog Day, but I also think that Be More Chill is underrated outside of fandom spaces. Also check out 36 Questions, which is a short free podcast musical I super enjoyed. The common thread of all these musicals is that they use their songs to advance the plot, with cleverly-written lyrics that are specific to the circumstance; I find a lot of musicals I tend to dislike have songs which feel more like... abstract ballads?

    EDIT: oh, on that note, I should mention that Joe Iconis (BMC songwriter) has a lot of standalone numbers on YouTube. Off the top of my head I like "Helen", "Ammonia", "All the Mistakes that he Made about the Girl", "Party Hat", "Dodge Ball", "Head Shot", and "Plants Make Wonderful Pets"

  On a rec from here, I read Defiance of the Fall over the last week. It's mediocre, but at least it's long? Not really recommended but not de-recommended either. Unfortunately all the most interesting bits are the bits the author writes about least, and the author's take on the genre is pedestrian.

    [Frank Schätzing](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Sch%C3%A4tzing)'s stuff is always worth reading.

    * Der Schwarm: More and more catastrophies originate from the deep sea. People begin to notice that pattern, and search for its origin.

    * Limit: To solve the energy crisis, an industry magnate wants to mine He-3 on the moon. Not everyone agrees with that plan. Has lots of funny references to the old Perry Rhodan series.

    * Die Tyrannei des Schmetterlings: Haven't read that one myself, a friend recommended it. Something about AI.

  Bit different from normal, but anyone got good resources of advice for writing and similar helpful content? Doesn't need to be rational-specific. A quick search showed me a bunch of stuff that prsents as marginally better than buzzfeed article tier content of "top 10 tips for writing, number 7 will blow your mind" and "Famous Author's one weird tip you should know." I figure the best advice source is the one that people have already used, so hence the recommendation question.

    Most of the good resources on writing are, unsurprisingly, books. There are so many good ones it's hard to recommend just a few, but here's a few:

    * Writing Tools: 55 Essential Strategies for Every Writer - Roy Peter Clark (and his other books)

    * Zen in the Art of Writing - Ray Bradbury

    * On Writing - Stephen King

    * Steering the Craft: A Twenty-First-Century Guide to Sailing the Sea of Story - Ursula LeGuin

    * Self-Editing for Fiction Writers, Second Edition: How to Edit Yourself Into Print - Reni Brown

    * Plot & Structure: Techniques and Exercises for Crafting a Plot That Grips Readers from Start to Finish - James Scott Bell (and other books by him as well as books by other authors in this series) 

    * Stein On Writing: A Master Editor of Some of the Most Successful Writers of Our Century Shares His Craft Techniques and Strategies - Sol Stein (and his other books)

    * Techniques of the Selling Writer - Dwight Swain

    * The 38 Most Common Fiction Writing Mistakes - Jack Bickham (you know the drill)

    * Writing the Breakout Novel: Insider Advice for Taking Your Fiction to the Next Level - Donald Maass (a.h.o.b.)\

    * Immediate Fiction: A Complete Writing Course - Jerry Cleaver.

    You can get as many more just by going on the Amazon pages for these and perusing the also-boughts.

    I would recommend taking books by screenwriting gurus with advice about the three act structure and the hero's journey and the like with a big-ass grain of salt, but you should read a couple just to know what that advice is. Save the Cat by Blake Snyder is an entertaining read, at least, so I'd suggest that one.

      (I spot a couple of books in this list that I remember from my 808 days and that I know to be good, which makes me think you should pay attention to the whole list.)

    Orson Scott Card's *How to Write Science Fiction & Fantasy* is simply essential, even if you're not writing sci-fi or fantasy. Its one of those books where you remember bits of pertinent advice you read years later.

    Stephen King's *On Writing* is useful for its mindset and its focus on being authentic, including the contradictions of being authentic, touching up your works for greater appeal, etc.

    Can second Sanderson's lectures. Touches on many topics and gives a feeling for what it might be like to actually be part of a market of books.

    Of course, Strunk's *The Elements of Style* is required reading, not really for the letter of its advice (which is often wise to ignore, although this is true for almost all writing advice), but simply to absorb and consider in your own way the wisdom of "Omit needless words!"

    Back when people still read in physical libraries, Dewey Decimal 808 (edit: 808.3) had tons of nice books on "how to write".  Turns out, lots of great authors out there coincidentally also have the ability to write good how-to books on writing!  I'm not sure how you'd find the corresponding material on Amazon, but if you have a physical library near you, it's worth checking out 808 and browsing through whatever you find there.

    One not mentioned yet is [Tufte's Artful Sentences](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60029.Artful_Sentences), which focuses closely on sentence-level writing and understanding grammatical structure and how to use it to create a desired effect. The way it's set out is by providing lots of good examples with fairly minimal discussion.

    If you dont mind podcasts, Holly Lisle and her daughter have one where they give really great and somewhat structured advice: _Alone In A Room With Invisible People_.

    Holly also has a free course on her website (hollyswritingclasses.com) that teaches how to write flash fiction. I found it very helpful. The point is to help you practice 'the basics' in something so small-scale.

    What are you trying to write? Scientific papers, business proposals, news articles, fantasy, etc., novels are all going to have different requirements, and tips on how to write them.

    If you are looking for advice on fiction/fantasy, I know Brandon Sanderson shares some tips/guides, given how he's considered one of the most prolific writers around they're wroth looking over.

    It depends a bit on what sort of thing you're trying to write, but for generic writing advice I really rate "7 Secrets of the Prolific" which is mostly about how to write reliably and extensively (which is the best way to get better at writing). I'm also a big fan of "100 ways to improve your writing" by Gary Provost for general writing advice (yes it sounds quite buzzfeed, but he died before buzzfeed was created and it's very good).

    I also really like "Style: Towards Clarity and Grace" and "Clear and Simple as the Truth", but honestly they're both nearly useless for fiction writing and are much more focused on good nonfiction writing.

    For fiction, a friend was recommending "Story Genius" by Lisa Cron recently. I haven't read it, but the premise sounds pretty interesting.

    George Saunders' *A Swim in a Pond in the Rain* came out recently. He's one of the greatest living short story writers and a creative writing teacher. In this book he explores short stories by Russian masters and what makes them great.

    *The Writer's Journey* by Christopher Vogler is a classic. It started off as a seven-page practical guide for fellow screenwriters at Disney and blossomed into a full book.

      A Swim in a Pond in the Rain is pretty great.

      The Writer's Journey is a toxic anti-pattern you're literally better off not reading anything about.

      It's interesting but it's very specifically a formula for writing episodes for the kind of shows Dan Harmon writes. If you examine some books you've read through this lens, you'll realize with most of them that a) it doesn't actually fit and b) even if it fits, trying to go from this structure to that story is like that "draw the rest of the owl" meme.
      ```

        Sure, it's not a theory of everything. I think it's just something to get you going and provide some minimal structure when coming up with ideas. I appreciate that it's not bloated. You can always read Hero with a Thousand Faces if you want the 1000 page version.

  I checked out the royal road recent goodies.  

  Vigor Mortis : Seems pretty fun to read, the worldbuilding needs some help but it should span out to be something of the level of azarith healer or BTDM

  Salvos: Enough has been said about it in previous threads and it was a pleasurable read.  

  Dark Lord's Home for Undead Heros: Very interesting start, and I have to say, the magic system is intriguing at the very least. I'll keep an eye on this one.
