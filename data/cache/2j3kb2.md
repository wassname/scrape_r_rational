  Story is a crossover between a manga called The Gamer and an anime called RWBY. I have no familiarity with either of them, and this was not a problem. (In fact, I started reading The Gamer after this fic and gave up after a few pages). Requires very basic familiarity with CRPG tropes, at the level of the original Final Fantasy, but I imagine this shouldn't be a problem for most of us.

  Link is to the first post of thread 1 of 4. I recommend reading exclusively via the indices on the first posts of each thread, unless you want to slog through ~600 pages of comments. Story appears to be updated consistently with one chapter per day.

  One could probably argue for an [RST] tag--there's definitely an awareness of sunk costs and taboo tradeoffs. 

  On a side note, I am vaguely disappointed that I didn't know about spacebattles.com until very recently. It seems to be at least as good a source of entertaining fiction as FF.net or AO3.

    Are you aware of the [With This Ring](http://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-story-only.272850/) story?

    It's the only one I have read on there but it is fantastic. Updates every day with short (~1500 word) updates.

    How are you finding stories on that site? After finding With This Ring, I spent some time trying to find other quality fics and had no luck. It doesn't seem to be organized well to find new stuff.

      The only other story I'm reading on the site is **[The Last Angel](http://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-last-angel.244209/)**, which is a pretty interesting space opera. The last surviving human-built AI warship looks to extract revenge upon the alien society that destroyed Earth. Very reminiscent of the Halo universe.

  Haha this is ridiculous. But very fun.

  I'll second this recommendation. I didn't post it here myself because I'm not sure exactly how rational it would be considered (like with "With This Ring"), but I've been enjoying this fic *thoroughly* pretty much since it began. 

  What I'm saying is - whether it's rational or not, it's a good story, and I recommend it for that.

    Just out of curiosity, why don't you think With This Ring would be considered rational? The world it exists in isn't particularly rational, but the SI charachter is constantly recognizing things that don't make sense and attempting to fix them where possible. And since we still don't have an explanation for what the world is or how he got into it, the fact that the SI charachter is the only person (or one of the few at least) that attempts to go about things in a rational manor, maximizing goals, etc., qualifies it in my book.
    ```

    - u/Kodix:
      ```
      It's not that I don't think it's rational, it's that I don't think I'm a good judge of these things. 

      The "problem" is that I have no issues engaging my suspension of disbelief when the story is engaging, and so I will miss plot holes and obvious issues.
