## Possibly legal way to promote fanfiction? [Meta]

### Post:

I'm sick of no one getting any of my references. I'm sick of almost all of my favorite literary masterpieces not being respected or even known about by anyone that I have met or will ever meet in real life. Fanfiction seems to be so frowned upon that it is almost taboo. But of course, fanfics can't get published where more people will actually see it and learn to appreciate it because publishers are only interested in books they can profit from and they are not allowed to profit from fanfiction. So fanfiction gets stuck in more obscure places online never to see the light of day or the shelf of a library anywhere.

Here is my proposed solution: have good, already established authors write some fanfiction novels. Then have them make an agreement with some company so that each author includes an advertisement or product recommendation for that company in an authors note. Then that company profits from the advertisement included in the authors' note and not from the actual work of fanfic itself.  The author does not profit from the fanfic itself, but benefits from getting to write a novel just for fun that no one will expect that much of, at least at first. 

Since neither the author nor the company in such an agreement would be profiting from the original IP, it would hopefully still be legal.

I have no idea whether this idea has any chance of working. Thoughts?

  This already exists, it's called licensed works. Star Wars is perhaps the most well-known example, but there are tons of these, mostly based on TV franchises, role playing games, or video games. Lately I've been some panels at SF lit cons I go to pushing the line "These works are just as worthy of respect as original universes." I've even seen a book critic reading and reviewing some. And they've always been fairly successful, commercially.

  There's two big hurdles with these though. The first is that the author doesn't have the dream of a big payday. On the average, you'll probably make a better living writing in licensed work than trying to get noticed writing your own stuff. But you will never make *serious* money, because the parent company owns all the rights. You may not be asked to write the sequel if it's really successful. The characters and world aren't yours. You'll never get a licensing deal for the TV show, or movies, or toys. Now, 99.99+% of authors will never see that sort of thing anyway, and so it'd be smarter to take the deal and get a decent paycheck, but no one wants to give up the fantasy that their work is THE work that'll change the world.

  And that's the other problem. When you write licensed works, you aren't looked at as a creative artist as much. You are now a line-worker, a cog in the entertainment machine. It loses the glamour.

  So while I agree that would be nice, I don't think it'll happen. The only way to truly fix this is to overhaul our broken-as-fuck copy-write laws.

  That being said, fanfiction has a fair bit of appeal. Sure, you won't hear it talked about in lit circles, but it is widely read. Most traditionally published novels do not sell out their first print run of several thousand. I think of fanfic like romance novels. Extremely popular - the most-read genre by a WIDE margin, romance novels are where the money is. But no one ever talks about them, for various reasons.

  Lit in general is a niche interest tho. Even books that do very well don't necessarily mean anyone will get your references. Game of Thrones is, what, 20+ years old now? And until the HBO series started, almost no one would get a GoT reference, despite it being a successful book/series. In today's world, you need TV or Movie presence to be well-known. And that just can't happen with unlicensed fanfic.

  I don't know enough about the legalities to guess at whether the red tape will favour you or not, but I have a suggestion or two that might streamline things.

  A good first step of this process would, I think, be to have two authors who have expressed fondness of each others' work write their fanfiction novel based on the other author's work.  This accentuates the way each author supports the others' work and it would be easier to present it under a banner of the concept of published fanfiction.

  Another thing to consider is whether you could include a plan to have the company responsible for the source material approve the fanfics, to avoid grey areas like fanfics 99.9% identical to the source material to avoid copyright or subjects the company doesn't want people to associate with their story, since we know that for every HPMOR there's a Cupcakes.  It would be a compromise, sure, but it's a foot in the door that would otherwise be slammed and locked.

  If you really want to see this done, I'd think about contacting relatively new and less widespread authors for this, since it would be easier to get your message heard than if you were to try and get J.K.Rowling on board and newcomers to the field might be more amenable to such a novel idea.

  You're not alone in your frustrations, so if you end up deciding to take this somewhere I wish you good luck.

    This seems both unethical and counterproductive. It should not be necessary to get the original author's approval for a work of derivative literature to be promoted when no one is profiting from the intellectual property of the original author. That would be effectively saying that they have the right to decide what works I can and can't recommend to people or talk about in public. It would be like if I wrote a fanfiction and wanted to pay someone else to let me use their venue to do a dramatic stage reading of it, and was told by the original author that I couldn't do that.

    If they do take that line then my first amendment rights would be severely violated for the rest of my life since most of my favorite novels are fan fictions.

    The problem of course then becomes finding a company that's willing to stick it's neck out for the sake of first amendment rights. Even though no one would actually be profiting from the original author's IP, it's a complex enough scenario that it's possible the original author might think they can get away with pretending that their copyright is being violated.

    Does anyone have any idea where I can find such companies willing to stick their necks out for first amendment rights?

      The idea here is to get official, mainstream recognition of the better works of fanfiction, right?  And you want that to be achieved by setting up an official framework for fanfictions to be written and spread in, right?  If so, the framework you want to make has to not tick off the people we're trying to get to support us.  If an author sees this plan and hears that they have no oversight, they might worry that people will use the platform to write incredibly disgusting stories in his world and spread them with a note advertising the original works that brings him the entirely *wrong* kind of reputation.  An author with no control over what stories are accepted in this framework might decide they don't want any part of it.

      Would this be a problem with every author?  Of course not, but even a handful of vocal detractors could stall or even kill your project, and I'd be willing to bet that from all of the authors who might hear about this plan you'd get a few who hate the idea of a gore-fic being used to advertise their children's story.

      This isn't a matter of first amendment rights, also, because we can already write and spread our fanfics as much as we want.  We have our platforms for spreading these stories and letting them gain attention by their own merit.  Just like not every book has a right to be accepted by publishers, not every fanfic would have a right to be accepted by this framework.

      I've already said that this would be a compromise.  Ideally, we could just take sites like Fanfiction.net and spread them far and wide, with robust systems for sorting the good fics from the bad, and watch people change public consensus, but we can't afford to have authors deciding to kill the entire platform if someone wants to write gore-fics of their books.

      That said, for expediency's sake we wouldn't want active approval of each fic, but the same level of appeasement could be achieved by letting the author object to fanfics that they have found and disapprove of.  Rejected fanfics still have our current systems for people who want to read them and supplementary sites might end up being formed to house fics rejected from the framework.

        I see your point. Only problem is that author approval isn't always a good measure of quality in a fanfic. I can easily imagine JK Rowling refusing to support HPMOR. It is basically a rebuttal/criticism of the very work that her fame and wealth is largely based on after all.

          Yeah, I really think it would be better if we had some way of giving the authors enough power to satisfy them that their reputation won't be ruined while also keeping them from having unilateral power to ban any fanfic that doesn't tickle their fancy.  I don't know if it's possible, but until such a balance can be struck I'd like to err on the side of keeping the framework alive.

  I'm sick of people seeking the normies' validation of their interests. We have obscure interests, why can't you accept that for what it is? Why does everything you like have to be popular and accepted by people who don't care for it?

  You seem to have this idea that fanfiction is only against the law if you make money off it.  This is not true.  It is against the law regardless; it's just that the company usually only bothers to go after someone who tries to make money off of it.
