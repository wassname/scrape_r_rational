    "hey Davo, I want to go climb a forbidden mountain on Christmas because I might be able to fight a demon inside my soul nobody knows exists for sure."  

    "say no more fam. 3 sets of climbing gear from our winter collection.  When do we leave?"

      They're all pretty good. You can imagine Davo's nose slightly raised in the air and eyes looking down on everyone as he talks. Fanny is the butt of comebacks and jokes but rarely he gets the upper hand, and those times always feel great.

      Simole's flirting/teasing is amusing, especially when combined with Dizzy seething in the background. Nic originally feels flat as a character given his passiveness, but now he dishes it out just as hard to anyone who isn't Dizzy.

      I'll admit, Davo is a very close second for me. He's certainly provided me with the most laugh out loud moments.

      The rest I find forgettable or downright infuriating (Dizzy).  That said, yes I do realize a lot of the excellent moments happen when everyone plays off each other.

  Kind of a slow buildup chapter.
