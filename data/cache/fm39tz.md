This is a slow-updating fic (first posted in 2015 and went on hiatus for a few years), but does not appear to be dead -- the last update was in Dec. 2019. It's been posted here [before](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3enwtw/worm_ff_agent_of_cauldron/), but I figured a repost 4y later was appropriate, since I missed it the first time around and only read it these last few weeks.

Overall I've really enjoyed its worldbuilding and characterization of Cauldron's many associates, which I think is where the focus shifts after the first few of arcs. Those are pretty fun too, though, and do indeed, per the description, follow >!"a girl named Asiyah. She triggers near Contessa and gains a variant of the Path to Victory. Due to poor wording, she ends up killing Eidolon. The story is about the aftershocks of his death and is aimed at fleshing out Worm's world."!<

I think in particular it does a decent job exploring the psychological effects of hewing close to the recommendations of precognitive felicific calculus, regardless of how many bullets you're forced to bite. Also portrays well the comings and goings of competent, powerful people, which is fun to read.

  I liked it, but >!the pileup of five different decade-long conspiracies by organizations with power levels that were totally out of wack with the rest of Worm was kinda hard to follow at times, and I still don't understand a lot of what actually happened there.!<
