  Disregarding the technical flaws like incorrect and awkward usage of Russian language, I simply don't understand or enjoy the genre. I'm a lowbrow who prefers that the narrative resembles real world rather than fever dreams, I suppose.

  As far as Russian snippet goes (using ISO 9 for transliteration):

  1. 'bol'šoj' is for masculine grammatical gender, but 'spasibo' is gender neutral; 'bol'šoe' is the correct word here.

  2. 'Konečno' sounds very awkward there. A significantly more common polite response is 'Ne za čto'.

  Didn't really understand the story past the obvious layer, but it was well written and interesting.
