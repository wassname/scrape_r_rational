  Trolls or half-trolls can "help" enormously with this if the vellum makers are willing to have a degree of moral flexibility.

  The first thought is Lenscrafting.  But really, any labor intensive and time intensive process with a relatively small finished good could benefit.  Glasses and telescopes would be significantly cheaper.  So would mirrors.  It could drastically speed up the making of wine or champagne.  Better yet, high-proof alcohol is another time intensive industry.  And Eragon (embarrassed to reference it) already had magic to use for fine expensive weaving.

  Quick question, does the spell draw from the knowledge of the caster or some platonic ideal of the process?  You could really get into an interesting freeze in technological development because the spell disincentivizes labor-saving devices.  However, if it drew on the personal knowledge, I expect wizards would probably try to be expert level craftsmen as well.

    Draws on the knowledge of the caster.  Anything more complicated than a basic bridge requires the caster to have some specialized knowledge.

  ```
  Is Fabricate capable of replicating already-printed books?  I could see, for example, mass producing encyclopedia sets and "cube" libraries of references for villages or nobles.
