    I yet live! I really didn't want to be responsible for a deadfic, those things bug me.

    We actually had a long discussion about it in-thread. While it's sub-optimal for team 7, it still came out ahead in terms of maximising the effectiveness of all of the clan teams.

    The funny thing is I would have actually preferred to write Sasuke than Hinata.

        Canon doesn't really... give Hinata a personality. So I have to make her interesting, but not *so* interesting that she suddenly becomes out of character and people find it weird. This is fairly limiting because I can't really have Naruto, Hinata or Kakashi engage in witty banter. Naruto can't keep up with the level of conversation, Kakashi is too lazy to try and Hinata I have to make demure and quiet. She's subtle, she's shy, she's understated, and that's really hard to get right considering I'm still fairly new to writing stuff. I've never written understated before, banter I can churn out by the bucket load.

  I was so worried this was dead since you were doing Marked for Death. Thank you for continuing this <3

    It was actually really helpful to be able to pick those guys' brains for plot and worldbuilding ideas.
