## How can you weaponize aerokinesis or the ability to control air?

### Post:

* You don't have full control of air, you have a very limited sphere of control about a square foot from your body which can improve slightly with practice.

* The closer it is to your body the easier it is to control, with it being easiest to control air in front of your hands. The difference in control between air in front of your hands and air at the outside edge of your control is massive.

* You can push or pull (and by extension compress) air but only to a degree. You start with the power to make a strong gust which can be improved over time to do things like fly, propel things fast etc. 

* Using your power drains you and if you use it too much you will collapse. The stronger you push or compress air the harder it is on your magical stamina. This can increase with practice just like a muscle. 

I'm mostly interested in combat applications. Some are obvious like firing compressed air into a tube for a makeshift gun, but others are questionable.

Can you really cut with air or make an air blade? I know if you add electricity you can get a plasma torch but how fast do you need to move air to get that to work? How can you use compressed air as a weapon? Is air useless without some sort of object (like a tube) to shape it? 

I'm hoping to get some semi-scientific answers or some good ideas as I have no clue how you would do much with this power other than use it to make a gun or to fly.

  Do you obey conservation of momentum?  That is to say: when you pull some air upwards, does it push you downwards as well (as if you were holding a giant fan) or else is it independent of you (as if there was a giant fan attached to the earth, that you can control/aim)?

  Assuming you can get good maximum pressures out of your power instead of just good velocities, the easiest force-multiplier would be bottles of compressed air.  You only need pressure at the opening of the bottle, and you can easily charge the entire bottle instead of just the portion that's within a few inches of your skin.  This could help with both making a gun and with flying, but I can't think of anything novel.

    Good idea with compressed air, though that sounds to me more like a grenade than a force multiplier. Maybe in metal containers and not glass. Imagine highly pressurized air in a glass bottle, then lobbing it at your opponent, ouch.

      I was thinking compressed air as a power source, rather than as a discrete item (and bottles like [this](http://www.cyl-tec.com/images/products/compressed-gas-cylinder.png)).  The problem with air control isn't that you don't have enough energy to do anything, it's that you don't have enough *power* therefore you need to get a large amount of buildup to go into a single attack.

        Yeah, you could equip the character with all manner of compressed air-powered devices, which he or she can re-pressurize as often as needed. However since apparently the character has no sensory powers over air, presumably he or she requires direct line of sight to the air that needs to be shaped and may lack the fine control needed as well.

          I've always used "no sensory powers" to mean that target selection is based off of your sense of where your body is, not off of vision.  For example, you could target "one foot out from the tip of your finger" or "along the inside of your forearm"

  >Can you really cut with air or make an air blade?

  I don't think you can shoot one or anything like that as a high speed line of air would have low inertia and would quickly destabilize outside of your control radius, but if your air control is fine enough you can get a sort of poor man's psychokinesis by pushing things around with air molecules. Just put all your mojo into a razor thin line of air molecules and bam, instant slice and dice. But only within your radius where you can keep exerting that pressure.

  This would of course be useless just about always in your setting, because it sounds like the only way you could hope to have that much control in your setting would be to do it right in front of your hands, at which point you might as well use a knife.

  >Is air useless without some sort of object (like a tube) to shape it?

  Can't you just shape it with your powers? I mean tubes aren't magical, they just direct the motion of the pressurized air, which your powers should presumably be able to do? I suppose that would require constant effort whereas a tube would do the heavy lifting for you.

  >How exactly would you fly, by pushing down on the air or by pushing air into you?

  Assuming this power follows Newtons third law just pull/push air above you to below you, thus pull/pushing yourself upward.

  if it doesn't follow Newtons third law just make a really big updraft below yourself. Also you can do lots of other awesome stuff if it doesn't follow Newtons third law, such as pushing your spacecraft forward by pushing the air inside it forward.
  ```

    Follows newtons third law, my last question was a little stupid but then again there are no stupid questions.

    If you were using wind only you could do things without a tube but I don't see how you can control and accelerate a projectile effectively. You would have to push wind in every direction to stabilize the bullet + generate enough force to accelerate it, and then what happens if you want to spin it to add more power? I doubt I could do the math for that much less enact it with my power. Even if I could a simple rifled tube would allow me to conserve a lot of magical stamina since all I need to do is compress air and release it into the tube. You could simply push the bullet but your aim would probably suck and it would be less powerful, it would become more like a sling at that point.

    ~~Air by it's nature is pretty inaccurate it's not like I can put constant force upon objects directly, I'd need to basically constantly hit things with small gusts of air to keep them afloat. To even hold a bullet steady and straight in the air would take a lot of skill and concentration.~~

    Actually now that I think about it if I can compress air then I can hold conflicting pressures around the bullet to hold it steady, but still less accurate and less power and more stamina usage than if I used a rifled tube.

    If your setting contains modern security elements like metal detectors, the air blade is useful as an undetectable weapon that will never leave traces identifiable to you in you in your victim. In addition, with weak areokinesis you could keep trace particles from leaving your area, preventing you from leaving DNA fragments. Assassinate at will.

      Which isn't really that useful a trained criminal with a non-metal knife can do the same thing. 

      Really all I'm getting so far is flying, gun, fast movement, gusts to both knock people down and deflect projectiles and weapons. Useful abilities but nothing overpowered. Setting I have in mind is medieval btw but I don't mind things that apply to modern society, this is a hypothetical question only tangentially related to a fiction I plan on doing.

        The air blade should not be overlooked; even if it's little more than a weightless, invisible knife more or less held in your hand, that's still a *weightless invisible knife that cannot be confiscated*. The advantage of a knife over another weapon is the speed with which it can be wielded due to it's low weight, and an air blade maximises that advantage and then some. Moreover, a good blade is a versatile tool outside of combat, and not having to clean, sharpen, or otherwise maintain an actual knife is all by itself a pretty friggin' neat superpower, *especially* in a medieval setting.

         The nearest approximation to this technique for which I could find a combat video was [Kabuto's chakra scalpel](https://youtu.be/sipbkkTNcOQ?t=75).

  * What do you mean by "air"? Any gas?  If so, get some [chlorine trifluoride](http://pipeline.corante.com/archives/2008/02/26/sand_wont_save_you_this_time.php).  Maintain it in a tight ball in your zone, then push it very strongly away from you. Keep pushing, because you don't want any of that crap coming back towards you. On second thought, forget it. This idea is suicide. Amazing to watch, but suicide. 
  * Learn some evasion- and blocking-based martial arts, get in close, suck the air out of their lungs. Do it fast enough and you can likely tear the lung tissue but no matter what they are going straight to the ground in unheard of pain.  
  * You can get stronger, can you get more precise?  Shooting a needle-thin jet of air into someone's ear doesn't require a lot of power in order to deafen them and mess up their balance. A jet to the eye could rupture the cornea, blinding them. A blast up the nose might cause an embolism. 
  * Can you move air that's in a container? If so, control the air that's already in their lungs. 

  Okay, time for bed. I may edit in more of these tomorrow.

  Can it be used for stealth? By holding the air around you still, the sound of your movements won't be transmitted over the air, although some perceptive people might notice the vibrations you make on the ground.

  Yes, you can cut with air. Observe this [water jet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crgujRcyhhE) cutting through steel plate. Both are fluids, air is simply less dense in its natural state. You could achieve a similar effect by adding small particulate matter to the air steam (sand, metal dust ect). The particulate pieces would grind through flesh and bone. It would work in either a point of plane configuration. 

  Similarly if you keep dust or sand in suspension with the air in motion you can create a static charge, which is how lightning is formed. Might not be any appreciable amount of lightning though, unless you're moving the air ridiculously fast. Like, fast enough to heat it to a plasma fast.

  Poison is an obvious application, especially as a ninja. Poison gas, nerve gas, caustic gas ect can be spread about the battlefield and your control of air would allow you not to be killed by these things. 

  Take a sphere of metal (ribbed for ~~her pleasure~~ better fragmentation). Fill it with extremely high pressure air then throw it while hiding behind a wall or rock. It will explode like a grenade pretty much the second it leaves your zone of control as the high pressure air expands against the inside of the sphere. 

  Use air to hold and throw weapons. Take a tube, fill one end with an airtight sabot filled with poison senbon and the other end with compressed air. Continue to compress the air while not letting it touch the senbon. Then close the open end and release control. The air will expand and propel a hail of needles against whoever.

  Get a pair of aerofoils, strap them to your back and run wind over them. Makes flying more efficient and less costly of energy.

  Shoot tiny blips of air into your enemies' veins for subtle assassinations. A while later they will suffer a blood clot and possible stroke or heart attack. Use wind to empower your strikes and leaps while weakening and slowing your enemies'. 

  If attacked by lightning or fire create zones of low pressure air. The lightning will be unable to form a plasma arc with no matter to use and thus be unable to cross the area of higher electrical resistance. The fire will not be able to cross the windbreak with no oxygen or fuel to burn, meaning that you'll only have to deal with radiation, not convection or conduction. Deadly fire attacks will become merely hideously painful.

  Do you have any sensory abilities over air, i.e. can sense fine differences in pressures within your sphere of influence, or is it just that you can exert undifferentiated force in any direction you wish on air? If so, is your sensory abilities and control fine enough to separate the different types of molecules in a gas?

  Note that being able to generate winds strong enough to enable a person to fly implies a rather powerful effect. You could easily knock down people with that as wind speeds of over 8o mph around you still means very powerful gusts farther away.
