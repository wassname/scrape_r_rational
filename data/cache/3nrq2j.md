## How would you munchkin this: a device that answers yes or no questions

### Post:

Somehow you have come across a simple-looking 8.5x11" piece of paper with a remarkable property: if you write down a yes/no question at the top of the page and put it out of sight for an hour, then the next time you glance at it you will see the answer written in elegant cursive below your query. An additional hour later all writing is erased from the page and you can ask something again. You must print your question legibly, no smaller than what would normally correspond to a 12 point font. 

The piece of paper will not predict the future. It will not tell you which stocks will rise or fall tomorrow. It will, however, answer any question about the present or the past, provided the question itself is well-defined. 

When your question is insufficiently precise, you will see a slanted question mark appear beneath your query in response. "Is Fermat's last theorem true?" produces such a question mark. By contrast "Does Fermat's last theorem follow from the ZFC axioms?" produces a "Yes." It seems that the paper has some background knowledge and does not need an explanation of what Fermat's last theorem is or what the ZFC axioms are. 

Asking "Has my girlfriend cheated on me?" produces a question mark. The paper does not have care to parse the (culturally dependent) context of "cheating." On the other hand, if you ask whether your girlfriend has engaged in certain acts and provide anatomical descriptions, you will have your answer. 

It seems as if there is no fact about the past or present the paper does not know.  Direct questions ("What are you?") produce only question marks in response. So do questions without a yes/no answer. 

You would not decline riches and fame, but you'd really like to use this thing to do something meaningful for humanity. What do you do?

Edit: some words.

    As a hypothetical, imagine that someone in Ancient Greece had this piece of paper. Could that person use it to advance the state of scientific knowledge to 20th century level within their lifetime via binary search? 

    I'm not so sure. It seems that certain conceptual leaps are necessary to even *ask* the right questions. For example, to even conceive of relativity theory one has to be able to imagine time as "just another dimension" not altogether different from the three spatial dimensions.  I believe even something as basic as the use of coordinates was foreign to ancient Greeks and introduced by Descartes.

    That would also be my goal, but I'm not sure we could get all the way there given the time constraints others are talking about, but it would definitely get you some really really great to have information about where to look. 

    I'd probably start by categorically ruling out things that, while most rational people dismiss them, would completely change the game if they existed. I'd ask about magic, the supernatural, and perhaps spend one question on technologically advanced aliens. Hopefully it wouldn't take long to rule out things like lich-dom and then you could go back to the difficult task of asking specific enough questions to get answers that advance science.

    Precision for direct immortality questions would be difficult. Does having your name "immortalized" in history (or a headstone) count?

    I think I would start by looking for small molecules to cure various conditions. I'd start with diseases that are currently sucking up all the research funding, but aren't producing very fast advances, for example Alzheimer's:
    "have one or more molecules existed that would, at some correct dosage, cure greater than 80% of Alzheimer's patients without killing them?"

    If you get a yes then you find it with

    "For the molecules referenced by the question asked at [first question's date/times]. Is the k-th character of the IUPAC name for the molecule with the shortest IUPAC name numeric?" 

    You'd know you had the complete name when you asked about the next character and got a ?. 

    Now you just have to ask about dosage per kilo and/or administration methods and hardest of all, get the FDA to trust the paper enough to skip clinical trails for things discovered by precise use of the paper.

    Even assuming you are awake 24/7 or can have a printer print new questions on it every two hours, that's only 12 questions per day. That may not be nearly enough to discover the precise parameters of even one path in a lifetime.

    You *could* use it to discover if anyone has already accidentally stumbled on the path, and eventually get a name and location for them. If you're blindly sweeping for the path, though, you could be there a very long time.

  Having flawless information looks pretty similar to predicting the near future. Humans already make all sorts of predictions of the future without knowing it. 

  Stock prices etc. are just a form of information, and any information advantage you have on the market can easily be translated into money. It's the ultimate in insider trading. Magic paper, is there a greater than 55% chance that Apple stock will increase by 2% in the next week? If I know whether a rumored merger is actually being discussed I have a huge advantage on the market. Magic paper, has the Fed decided to lower interest rates? Have G.E.'s earnings exceed the predicted value over the last quarter? This information is all known well before it's announced, and thus is well within the power of my notebook paper, but before it's publicly known, it's basically as good as gold. 

  Making lots of money ........ ✔


  It also seems like it would be super useful for guiding research. Lots of long research projects have single bit answers at the end. Does P=NP? Is cold fusion possible? Can a superconductor stable at standard temperature and pressure be created using currently available technology? 

  Advancing science and human progress ........ ✔

  And then of course my piece of paper is a halting oracle, and so I can specify an encoding and use it to output a binary representation of the answer to virtually any question. I'll need some knowledge to start with so I can ask good questions with short answers, but since I have plenty of money to hire researchers and I am hyper-efficient at directing research, paying people to come up with good compression algorithms for hard questions shouldn't be too difficult. Outputting the chemical formula of miracle materials like cancer cures and cheap water splitting catalysts seems particularly easy. 

  God-like power .............. ✔

  It having knowledge of everything but lacking contextual clues seems incompatible. Either an entity knows *everything* or it doesn't. It would seem to me that it would know the answers to such questions, but be unable to give them for some reason.

  I would begin by asking if it can answer questions about itself. Figuring out how the paper works (how it actually collects the information) could be even more valuable than the paper itself.

  I would try to get more than yes or no answers out of it. For a question "X" I would ask "Is the first letter of the answer to "X" the letter 'a'?" and repeat for each letter.

  What I would do next would depend on if the above works.

  Edit: "Do you have a computational power limit?" and "Do you consume energy to function?" seem like highly important questions.

  >The piece of paper cannot predict the future. It does not know which stocks will rise or fall tomorrow. It can, however, answer any question about the present or the past, provided the question itself is well-defined. 

  It knows the state of the world, it knows physics, and it is apparently good at calculating, so it can be used to predict the future even if you have to use some workarounds.

  As the simplest possible example, ask it "is there milk for sale at Store X".  Given its answer, you can predict whether or not you will find milk there when you go shopping.

  You can flip a coin and hide it under a cup without looking.  Ask it "Is it heads?"  You can then predict what you will see when you lift the cup to check.

  You can also set up a Rube-Goldberg machine (that will flip a coin) in very controlled conditions, and ask it "Is this machine set up to flip heads?"  You can then predict the machine's actions.

  You could ask "Does this person have pre-cancerous (or cancerous) tumors that are consistent with mortality within five years if untreated?"

  Not being able to *directly* predict the future isn't that big of a handicap.

  Question 1: is there at least one chemical substance that cures all forms of cancer in homo sapiens without killing the patient?

  Assuming yes:

  Q2: Let's call the substance that is the cheapest to produce and fullfils these conditions a substance S. Is the first letter of  the chemical formula of substance S before "L" in the Latin alphabet?

  And so on...

  Set up a printer and a camera to do the menial labor for me. Perhaps a critter behind a timed window to do the glancing.

  To circumvent the length restriction: "What is the answer to the question in the file C:\ask.txt?"

  "Suppose there was a copy of me at the time of the last time I clapped my hands in a deterministic universe in which it is omnipotent, initially containing it, a functional copy of this piece of paper and a keyboard with buttons labelled Yes and No. What is the label of the button it presses first?" Continue with second, third, etc.

  My plan is that the copy first thinks long and hard about whether the real universe is still needed. After all, from its point of view, it has already won. Permutation City is a pretty good happy ending.

  The first bit the copy transmits is to be whether I should ask further questions about its universe. The second bit is to be whether the following plan is okay or whether I should think again. The next few bits do exponential/binary-search on the number of bits in the verbose message transmitted immediately after via... probably dictionary-binary-search. (The exponential search begins with a bit saying whether the first verbose message ends.)

  I am expecting the first message to specify a better transmission protocol. Possibly it'll just be garbage that Simurghly guides the universe towards maximum utility via chaos theory, depending on how hard my copy succeeds in exploiting its ressources. (After all, I gave it all it needs to instantiate further universes!)

  In the actual situation, I would think long and hard on the formulation of the universe of the copy I would actually use. You can tell me how badly the "wish" I wrote above is subverted by the genie, and you can also tell me how well it would work if I had specified my CEV better.

  Use it to solve np hard problems. Self reductions and binary search would give you good answers. 12 bits per day of oracle knowledge is quite useful computationally.

    The immediately following questions should probably be a careful interrogation to ensure that it's not the existence of the sheet of paper that causes the odds of survival to be so low.
