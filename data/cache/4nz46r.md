  As a therapist I'm intrigued, but also have to ask before I read it to appropriately set my expectations: do you work in any mental health fields, or are you basing it off research?

    I'm an EMT. I know some of the jargon, and have dealt with the people, both from my job and from my own personal history, but I'm not what you'd call an expert. Her power basically draws from the DSM, but I might get some things wrong. I would love constructive criticism.

    Edit: Also, there's basically no research concerning what happens when you instantly clear all psych disorders from someone with no side-effects or drugs. That is going to be author fiat, because short of actual wizard magic, it's all anyone can do.

      Don't forget the lessons of Naruto. Fists are therapeutic. Beatings /are/ magic.

      Sounds good :)

  Looks good so far :). Might want to cross post this to /r/wormfanfic too!

  > If I touched, say, Kaiser, things would go downhill for the E88 fast.

  This implies that Kaiser's activity, or maybe his racism, is *primarily* driven by some form of mental illness... 

  This power is gonna get awfully controversial awfully fast. 

  In fact it looks like your comment section has already gleefully restarted the eternal "what counts as a mental illness?" argument. With guest appearances by Asperger's, sociopathy, and minority sexual desires.

  I'm both anticipating and dreading the times where you'll have to drop Word of God on the grey areas.

  Like the premise!

  I asked about whether people were interested in this on Friday, and a few people responded. I was already writing it, so I've started putting it up on SV.

  Taylor got a shard called Conflict Resolution. Her powers prevent her from having psychological disorders, let her see disorders in others, and let her cure all psychological disorders on touch. Expect more feels than fights. 

  This is the first time I've written anything, but I've put a lot of thought into this. Constructive criticism welcome.

    I like it.  Pretty clean and well written for a first attempt, well done.  I'll bookmark and see where it goes.
    ```

    - u/Frommerman:
      ```
      Thanks! I've got five more chapters written right now, so I'll probably be updating daily for the foreseeable future.

      Edit: Any other suggestions about where I should post this for more coverage?

    It's funny, that is exactly the kind of power that the Entities would not grant, as it is the opposite of their MO: generating conflict. 

    Also, x-post this to /r/wormfanfic if you haven't already.

    ```
    Does it cure shard-influence, too?  Or give a brief respite?

    Is Taylor immune?
    ```
