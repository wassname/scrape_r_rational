  >Tuesdays stopped happening.

  Tuesday is the third day, when God created dry ground, plants, and trees.  Earth skipped three Tuesdays.  It is also the third (and presumably last) Friday (when God created animals and man), that Uriel called the President.  He then goes on to play Bach’s Concerto I in D Minor, which has three movements.  On the first Friday, he stared at the phone for three minutes.

  ~~The phone call is at 7:38PM, Washington DC time, which is solar midnight in Israel.~~ No, it isn't.

  Uriel speaks exactly seven sentences to Nixon.

  Edit: There were 13 expletives deleted in the passage, there are 13 principles of the Jewish Faith, and God has 13 Attributes of Mercy.

  EDIT 2: March 14 is 80 days (40 + 40) from the day Apollo 8 crashed into the firmament.  

  None of this was a coincidence because nothing was ever a coincidence.

  EDIT 2.1:March 14 is also Steak and BJ Day, which may in fact be a coincidence.

    Re: Solar Midnight: DC is on -5, israel is on +2, so the time would be 2:38 AM. Sunrise would be coming at 5:52 AM, and had set previously at 5:48 PM. The time is closer to solar midnight somewhere in England/France/etc, at a guess

    This story is supposed to be lighthearted from what I hear, and this was perfect. I don't get a feeling of tension from the first chapter, only blue balls.

    I feel like that's supposed to be the point of the interludes, though. To lighten up a bit.

      My problem is that this one comes in too early. I'm not at the point where I need things to be lightened up, I want to get on with the actual plot. So on reflection I think I agree with /u/gardenofjew, the interlude pops the tension at a time when I wanted tension to be ramping up.
