  A healthy sense of humor is an informal requirement to be assigned as crew on the *Learning Is About To Occur*, which will come in handy as they go tearing back to the moon they just returned from.

  Gotta love being told, "taking more time to consider your options will result in destroying the world."

    Yeah 8-). Doc has developed strong habits for double or triple checking everything important when he has time. Those habits have served him well for most of his life, and he's not yet used to working with people with reliable technical judgement as good as his (like Ashil and DASI).  But he can recognize a clear signal that he doesn't have as much time as he thought when it smacks him in the face--and DASI warned him that he didn't pay enough attention to Breakpoint in her 'things you've been doing non-optimally' speech way back in chapter 8 of Skybreaker's Call: http://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/70967153929/skybreakers-call-chapter-8
