  Consider that Mr.Yudkowski [CH 122 spoiler](#s "pretty much provided us with an open world to explore, albeit one with some magically bound agencies, Harry Dumbledoring, and a few main quests to tie down. You could do nigh anything.")

  I'll try to read and leave reviews on all spinoffs that are attempted and shared, and I'm down to bounce ideas and drafts. This seems like a golden opportunity to dip toes into rational/rationalist writing.

    *cough*

    [Following the Phoenix](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10636246/1/Following-the-Phoenix), because it's a good story

    [Squiring the Phoenix](http://davidstorrs.com/viewforum.php?f=15), because Eliezer's pants *belong* in Washington D.C., damnit!

    [Team Anko](http://davidstorrs.com/viewforum.php?f=3), because Anko is awesome

      Ye, I am aware of these marvellous compositions.
      But with the Harry Potter & Lord Voldemort story complete, there's now a sandbox world of a rational universe that can be explored in any way desired. One could have humanist, rational but non-rationalist rebels fighting against a utilitarian dictator Hermione, the political career of the Girl Who Revived could be a story, or one could spin a tale of a super-powered unicorn Heroine wandering the earth, doing moral deeds and scratching lethifolds. It's like we finished the main campaign in Skyrim, and we can now do whatever we want.

        I am very onboard wth this as long as it doesn't involve sparkly vampires.

          I'd love to see a short story about Hermione wandering the earth like a restless kung-fu master.

            I'd offer to write it but apparently I can't write short stories -- I can do ~flash fiction ([around 500 words](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10069991/1/A-Wizard-Named-Harry-in-505-Words)) and I can do novellas, but I seem to suck at being in the middle.

  So if Harry ever dies, Hermione will become eternal Chief Warlock?

    ```
    This is the start of a rationalist "North Korea"-style Magical Britain with a Benevolent Eternal and Supreme Chief Warlock Sparkling Unicorn Princess.

          Nightmare Hermione sounds like fun.  But I also feel like we're really obligated to cast Holy and free her from the Nightmare's evil grasp.  Bugger.

              *Of course* someone wrote and performed a minor rock-opera about that whole bit of fictional history.  And unless I missed quite a lot, they animated it themselves, too.

              Also, all the jokes about Luna being *really bad* at socializing are now really obvious.  *Who the hell* shows up to a party in a magically-enhanced Grim Reaper costume designed to closely imitate the real thing?

        And the answer came, "Do your homework!".  That was the only answer that ever came.
