  > “Have to pick.” Learn conceded

  Yes.


  > “Orcs are because of you. We didn’t have a say there, either. We are as you made us. *Failed*. ”

  YES.


  > You hold us back, Free, but I will pull us forward, one at a time, if I have to give up *everything* to do so.

  **YES**!!!!

  Passive no more.  I love it.  Thank you.

  >He was no longer an orc. 

  LOL, what?  He's the orc-iest orc ever to **ORC**.
  Random Orc: "You are puny, weak.  You are no orc!"
  Learn: "I stood up to our *GOD*, Free, and told him to shove it.  What have you ever done with your life?"
  ```

  I enjoyed it.  It looks like the central conflict is finally being established, which is a large part of what I though was missing from the first few chapters.

  One thing that sat oddly:  it's strange that Learn omits the "I" from his sentences only when it would begin a new paragraph.  New sentences only, I could understand, but new paragraphs is a bit weird.

  Other than that, though, it feels like this is finally getting rolling, and I'm excited to see what happens next!
