    I made the post a link because my account is new, so I couldn't do a full post. Sorry about that!

    First, the story is a fantasy drama. The first arc, which I'm currently releasing, focuses primarily on the murder of one of the main characters' friends during her time at the college she's studying at, named the Soteria School for Seekers.

    Second, I focused on character writing while making this, and something I wanted to be sure to do is make sure that every character develops and acts in a way that indicates their experiences. The main character Sumire, for example, spent the majority of her life with her brother, who did his best to act as a father figure to her. That being said, she also spent two years of her teenage years alone with the person in her head, or the narrator of the story, whose negative outlook also did a number on Sumire's mental health and previously upbeat persona. The constant back and forth between Sumire and the narrator makes up the internal conflict of her character arc, which I feel she deals with and suffers in rational ways. Beyond that, the story's worldbuilding and the actions of the characters, I feel, are also handled in ways that make sense within the story and aren't ham-fisted like other stories are.

  Since no one else is discussing the merits of the story itself...

  Let's start with the good stuff.  The premise of having to fight off the influence of a possessing spirit (or something) in a world with superpowers (or something) is a good one.  It's remarkably free of technical and logical mistakes; as much of the plot and worldbuilding that has been revealed seems to be consistent and plausible within the rules of the world.

  That said, I quit before reaching the most recent chapter.  It just doesn't suit my tastes.

  The first chapter almost lost me within three lines.  Worldbuilding is one of my very favourite things in fiction, and this story seemed to be leaning entirely into the "Person says X, Person does Y" style of narrative, with almost no explanation.  Speaking only on behalf of my own personal tastes, this was not a good way to make a strong first impression upon me.

  Thankfully, after the first chapter (which appears to be a memory/dream?) the style shifts significantly for the better.  However, there's still a dearth of setting information (I made it ~8 chapters in, and I still have very little idea about what an Imperium is, beyond being some kind of supernatural ability, or what is special about this SSS school to make the main character want to attend), and I still find the ratio of dialogue/action to character/setting/plot development to be weighted much too heavily to the former.

  The main conflict for the first few (present-day) chapters is that the main character is late for her first day of school.  The problem with this conflict is that it feels like there's no stakes, for several reasons.  First, the consequences of being late aren't really considered by the main character, so we don't know what kind of trouble this could cause her.  It's a vague, impending sense of doom.  Second, the character adopts an attitude of, "Well, I'm already late, so it can't hurt to be a little later," which robs the decision to take the time to help someone else at the further expense of her punctuality of any tension.  If she doesn't care that she's late, why should we?  Third, after making the decision to help the person, there's no real suggestion about how it will impact the main conflict (yes, it will make her later, but **how much** later is never considered, nor what consequences being that much later will create).  And finally, to put the cherry on top of the complete lack of stakes, when she finally finishes helping out and arrives at school, it turns out she was **never late in the first place.**  School doesn't start until the afternoon of the first day.

  I managed to make it a few chapters further in, when the main character has to make a choice between being late (which I've already been thoroughly immunized to as a source of tension at this point) and not being able to take the bag with her clothes to school — I guess this is a boarding school? — which is immediately shown to have no consequences whatsoever (uniforms will be provided, and the MC is apparently cool with wearing a uniform at all times), at which point, I gave up.

  A story where the main character's choices don't have consequences just has zero appeal to me.  Especially not when the other aspects of storytelling —worldbuilding, history, backstory, themes, etc. — are barely touched on.

  If you don't like the first chapter, I strongly recommend at least proceeding to the second: it takes a remarkable shift for the better (in my opinion).  After that, as far as I've read, what you see is what you get; if you enjoy the second chapter, you'll probably keep enjoying it, otherwise perhaps not.

    Thanks for the feedback! It should be pretty evident through the storytelling, but I spent most of my efforts on internal conflict and character development. The real external conflicts are whats being established in the later chapters, which is what ties into the synopsis of the story. My thought process for setting it up this way was that the things that happen to the characters would mean more when you have an idea of what makes them tick & what their goals and motivations are. 

    As for the worldbuilding and setting, it's more of the same. Things are explained more as the series goes on, but I didn't want to info dump or put a bigger emphasis on the external makings of the world until their personalities were established to a basic degree.

    Do you know any books that you like that handle the internal/external conflict better and more interestingly? I'd love to read them for reference as I continue writing. Thanks again for the feedback!

  The dialogue in the first chapter kind of put me off.

  I don't really know how to explain it, but it basically hit my uncanny valley of character dialogue, where I could tell there was a lot of thought put into narration and character motivations and stuff, but it felt *just* off enough that I couldn't get into the story.

  (also having characters talk about mangas or other bits of popular culture in the opening scene of a story is a big no-no for me)
