  Wait... what? This actually updated? While hpmor is updating? This is a great thing... but... what?
  ```

  - u/PeridexisErrant:
    ```
    Also the worst cliffhanger in a long time, given that it could be literally years before it gets resolved.
    ```

    - u/Valsivus:
      ```
      In that case I'll check back in another few years.
      ```

    - u/tacticaltunic:
      ```
      Author's note at the end says he will have more opportunity for writing. I'm choosing to be optimistic and say that means a few months.
      ```

  Can somebody write a plot synopsis? I don't care enough to reread it.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    The plot diverges with canon after HBP. After years of war, Voldemord is dead, and so are most of Harry's friends. In despair he kills himself with the ritual, and his soul travels back in time and merges with 11-old Harry.

    He immediately starts physical exercises, occlumency practises and DA in first year, defeating Quirell alone without any problems. He prevents Ginny from getting the diary, but fails. In book 2 he reveals himself to a friends. He saves Sirius from Azkaban early on. That's all I can recall.
    ```

- u/JackStargazer:
  ```
  My bet is on that was a fake wand. What sane, paranoid NoFP!Harry would keep his real wand in an easily accessible pocket and turn his back to an enemy?

  I thought they had wrist-strapped wand-holsters that turned themselves invisible, but that might have been a different fic. It's been a while since I've read this one.
  ```

    ```
    It's gonna squawk and turn into a rubber chicken.
    ```

- u/DangerouslyUnstable:
  ```
  It's been so long that I literally don't remember what was going on, and I'm debating whether it's worth it to reread with the possibility of such a long interval again.
  ```

  - u/PeridexisErrant:
    ```
    Give it a month or two - the author is saying he'll have more time to write in the near future, so you'll know one way or another.
    ```

- u/eaglejarl:
  ```
  The part that excites me is that the author is getting back to Team 8!
  ```

  - u/JackStargazer:
    ```
    Oh. Well, that's actually much more interesting to me as well.

    Of course, I'd give it like 3 months before expecting an update.

    I think I've really been spoiled by the regularity of non-HPMOR uploads here.
    ```

    - u/kaukamieli:
      ```
      Not to mention all the other lovely fics, like waves arisen, that came daily and got completed...
      ```

- u/qbsmd:
  ```
  Oh, good. I just re-read that fairly recently and was wondering if the author would ever finish it.

  I wish fanfiction.net had an option for authors to upload an outline (or list of spoilers or some statement about where the story is going) that starts out hidden but becomes visible automatically if there are no updates for two or three years. That way, stories would at least have an ending, even if it isn't developed as well as one would like.
  ```

- u/None:
  ```
  Holy shit. The last time this updated had to have been in.... 2012?

  I'm not complaining, but my god I never expected this to happen!
  ```

  - u/PeridexisErrant:
    ```
    Likewise!  And chapter 38 was released 2009 (or 10?), so I remember being surprised last time too...
    ```
