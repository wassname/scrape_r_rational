## Rational ideas that are not rational to implement due to irrational population

### Post:

I'd like to see people's thoughts on rational ideas that are not rational to implement.

There are dangerous places the discussion can go with this, please be careful to avoid the really dark corners, or at least spoiler them.

There are a lot of really good ideas in the world that simply will not work because of irrational elements in our society.  My example is an electromagnetic cargo-only launch system that we could use to shift raw materials and supplies into space, allowing us to more rapidly develop a space industry.  We can do it, but it would be expensive.  It would take away from other pork-barrel contracts, but it would be an incredible investment for space infrastructure.

The irrational element of society just doesn't see space as useful.  They won't invest in it.

What other examples do you have?

  I think a lot of people are mistaking flights of fancy for rationality. If we don't have the tech to do it, it's not rational. If it's rational for other actors to mess with it, the problem isn't an irrational populace.

  >My example is an electromagnetic cargo-only launch system that we could use to shift raw materials and supplies into space, allowing us to more rapidly develop a space industry.

  We don't have the technology to do this, and a space industry is a low priority for most. Most of the benefits come from satellites, which don't need a big space industry. We could possibly develop the technology, but till we do and know how hard it is this isn't a plan.

  You can get atomic batteries, and society is rational enough to use them, but they're absurdly expensive and lithium is cheaper. Unless you have a cost analysis that says there's a load of applications where a 40 year battery is necessary this isn't rationality, this is a theory.

  /u/TimTravel communism is a terrible government system for many reasons. It centralizes power heavily in a central government, reduces responsiveness and reducing politician's need to help far away people, and Marx's ideas and many of his successors are a mess. It also gives people strong incentives to do shoddy work, ignore regional problems, and be corrupt.

  /u/topiary_quail in a democracy there are many competing interests, some of which are rationally against each other. Hilary Clinton wants to cut the private sector at the expense of the public sector. She as such appeals to unions, a major powers in the democrat party. Donald Trump wants to strengthen the private sector at the expense of the public sector. He as such appeals to businesses, a major power in the Republican party.

Financial planning isn't rational if any money you save up is likely to be stolen, and not having babies isn't rational in a high danger environment, children take care of you. Plus, injuries are random and disabilities are random, 'should' has little place in a rationality discussion. We should base our ethics on what works, not on what 'should' happen.

  On drug use, that depends on what the studies say about whether legalization increases or decreases use. What you think people can handle doesn't matter.

  So to summarize, none of the ideas I saw here are actually implementable plans that would have obvious benefits.

  Comprehensive sex education. Reduces the pregnancy rate of teens, generally agreed to be bad, lessens healthcare costs, reduces abortions, reduces stds. Objections include irrational religious arguments and irrational beliefs that sex education will increase how much sex people have, contrary to studies.

  Treating criminals like humans. Many proven benefits in reducing reoffending, the cost savings would be immense and if the unions object we could just keep paying union guards to sit in a room and still save money. Not done due to irrational need by people to get revenge on criminals.

  Give homeless people houses and starving people food. It's far, far cheaper to give people their basic needs so they can survive than dealing with them in jails and hospitals. Prison should not be used as welfare for the poor. People don't do it for irrational reasons relating to a fear that money will be wasted, so money is wasted anyway.

  Mass vaccination, safety from common diseases. Vaccines massively improve health. Reason why it's not done- irrational fear of it causing autism. Many places are forcing people to vaccinate their children.

  Those are the immediate ones that come to mind.

    We already have maglev trains, supercolliders, and electromagnetic weapons are going through some of the last hurdles before being placed on advanced warships.  Certainly, there will be engineering obstacles, but most of those engineering obstacles can be resolved by a fusion of the technologies used for the three of these successful implementations of electromagnetic propulsion.

    Launch to orbit doesn't need as much mass as a train, or the velocity of a particle in a supercollider.  We also don't need to limit ourselves to the extremely short acceleration window of the weapon.  We certainly don't want to use this to launch people, or extremely large masses, at least to begin with.

    On the money side of things, I believe you will find that people and corporations with 'billions to spare' very rarely put those billions towards a single speculative venture.

    Speculation investments in the millions is not uncommon.  Venture capital in the tens of millions for a single project happens every now and then.  I can't think of any speculative ventures funded to the tune of 100+ million but I wouldn't doubt they exist.  (Saturn, Global Crossing, American Superconductor may have started with this range of venture capital)  Billions though?  That sort of money rarely moves into a single project unless it's a pretty solid prospect, run by proven industry leaders.

    The problem is that there aren't any proven space industry leaders, because there is no space industry.  Partly because we do not have reasonably inexpensive launching systems.

    An individual with a massive amount of money who might consider exposing themselves financially to such a huge degree would have to contend with levels of risk that are difficult to comprehend.  What if they put three billion dollars into the system, and then have the government shut down the launch site because someone recently discovered a rare, endangered bird nesting habitat nearby?  What if there is an accident which doesn't critically damage the project, but does raise the insurance rates to insane levels?

    The first electromagnetic launch-to-space project will almost certainly be government-built, because it's just too damn risky for individuals or companies to touch - at least until there is one to prove the concept.

      The way you describe it, the real problem is getting from 0 to billions before you even start. The normal solution to this is to create some sort of proof of concept or work on a smaller system or at least do something to demonstrate that your team knows what its doing and that the concept is feasible. Then you'll be rolling in VC, or just get acquired by a big company.

      Have you considered how fast you would have to be going to reach orbit, without extra rockets? With rockets? Have you considered the amount of acceleration required to get up to the speed required? 

      LEO is 7.8km/s, so to reach it you'd need to accelerate something quite a bit faster than that to account for speed lost to increased gravitational potential and, the bigger factor I think, air resistance. I don't think it's easy and I have a lot of questions about whether it's sensible or feasible to even have something moving that fast near the surface of the Earth where the air is densest.

      That's ignoring getting the electricity to the area, which presumably can't be too near a city since it'll be heated by the fast moving spaceships. Did you know that one of the constraints for determining where to build a something as mundane as data center is whether there is enough electricity available?

      These are all things you have to worry about before event getting to the complicated issue that would be the electromagnetic acceleration. I don't think this is very easy and even for something as "simple" as building a normal rocket took SpaceX multiple attempts.

    The problem is the general public does not understand Radiation and Radioactives.  It takes a lot of effort to train Radiation workers and a lot to keep them trained.  That and to understate, people are afraid of what they don't understand.  Thermal batteries require respect as do all things with activity levels not measured  in negative exponents of micromicroCuries/ml, but they aren't a problem if they are respected and sealed and have adequate shielding.  So I wouldn't want them in a car.

    On the flip side if the population was understood radiation it'd mean a much higher level of understanding of basic physics.

      The other part is all the times where a container of radioactive material has little protection and no labels. A lot of the stories in the two links above are about innocents (or criminals, but that's not the point) unknowingly dismantling a radioactive device for scrap metal. I have no illusion that all of them would've heeded warning signs if they had been any, but it would have helped.

    Assuming you're talking about the designs used in space craft, they do run out of charge, it's just an exponential curve rather than a sudden stop.

    Plus, the characteristics that make them good for spacecraft aren't the same as the characteristics needed in a say a car. There's many good reasons not to use them beyond safety concerns.

  Alcohol prohibition. Society-at-large has proven, to my satisfaction, that it cannot handle easily available recreational alcohol. In addition to the tens of thousands of people killed every year by drunk drivers, it's hard to know how many people are hurt by the effects of addiction, which cannot be predicted in advance and often prevents its own treatment. There are some cases where alcohol can't hurt anyone (drinking in your own home if you are known to not be addicted, and such), but the current ease of access to alcohol is doing considerably more harm than good.

  Unfortunately, most paths from a drinking society to a prohibitionist society are worse, what with *the mafia*. Luckily, self-driving cars will solve most of the lethal part of the problem.

  - u/alexanderwales:

    This was the first thing that came to my mind.

    During Prohibition, as part of an effort to stop people from drinking industrial alcohol, it was denatured and methyl alcohol was added, making it toxic. They thought that people would change their behavior, because if a rational person knows that there's poison in the alcohol then they'll stop drinking it. The end result was that the United States government killed ten thousand of its own citizens.

    (Though there were other problems with this plan.)

        Why? Caffeine is a performance enhancer, and as such it has a strong positive effect on your life, for a fairly minimal cost (since it's so cheap and widely available). 

        So why would it be a rational choice to stop using it?
        ```

        - u/Farmerbob1:
          ```
          Addiction is different from using it for a specific purpose every now and again.  If you have to have that coffee in the morning or you're incapable of functioning before noon, it's a problem.

          There are a vast number of legitimate uses for many drugs.  A shot of alcohol a day, helps keep arteries clear.  If you couldn't sleep the night before, and you have to drive, a 5-hour energy B12 drink will work wonders.  If you need a pick-me-up for a presentation after an exhausting morning, something with caffeine in it might be just the thing.  Cocaine, from what I have read, is actually extremely beneficial to the thought processes for a few minutes if taken in moderation, though one must plan for the downtime afterwards.  The leaf of the plant is chewed by indigenous people for energy.  Coca-Cola was originally a warm syrup drink made from Coca, and served to railroad workers and other hard laborers.  Opium and morphine are excellent painkillers.  Marijuana for appetite enhancement for chemo patients and for glaucoma.  The list goes on and on.

          It would be irrational to stop using these chemicals completely, without formulating replacements.  It is also irrational to become dependent on them without clear reason.  Most of them are harmful over time, with a great deal of use.

        - u/Salivanth:
          ```
          You may be right, that it's rational to use caffeine under certain circumstances. With that said, there's a difference between using something as a performance enhancer and being addicted to it, and I personally fall under the latter category. Whenever I stop using it for a day or two, I get headaches and nausea. I also have a lot of trouble moderating myself when it comes to caffeine. 

          I drink soda as my caffeinated beverage of choice (Have never liked coffee. Apparently it's an acquired taste, and I quite deliberately have never acquired it) and I find it much easier to buy and drink no soda than to buy some soda, and drink it a little at a time.

          I'm genuinely asking this question, because I don't know the answer. Would caffeine be more effective as a performance enhancer if used sparingly, rather than used multiple times each day for no other reason than habit/addiction/preventing withdrawal?

          If caffeine does indeed provide a reasonably effective 'always on' performance boost even consumed several times each day, it might indeed be rational for me to keep using it after all. I'm not sure how I would feel about that.

        I can't think of any case where prohibited drugs of any type have been successfully eradicated through legislation.  Some drugs have fallen into disfavor and disuse due to other drugs being introduced that are easier to hide/transport.

        The Taliban, in Afghanistan, managed to eradicate poppy farming, if I remember right.  I do not think most rational people would want a government as oppressive as the Taliban was, even if it were not a fundamentalist religious state.  My understanding was that there was a warning, then the loss of a body part, and a third incidence of farming poppy meant death.  I may be mistaken on particulars.

        Global terrorism is funded in part by the illegal drug trade, and is more potent than ever.  There are quite a few second and third world governments that are in perpetual low-level civil wars with criminal cartels that fund themselves via selling drugs to first world nations that have made the drugs illegal.

        I believe there is a fairly clear indication that making drugs illegal gives rise to powerful organizations which actively seek to preserve both the illegality of drugs, and their ability to market them.

      No, because you didn't take into account the opportunity cost.

      The decision isn't "spend the 200 billion in the alcohol industry, or burn the money." It's spend the 200 billion in the alcohol industry, or spend it somewhere else (or save it). 

      Standard economic theory (assuming rational actors) would suggest  that, whatever consumers choose to spend money on instead, it would bring *less* utility than spending it on alcohol, but not zero utility.

    I'm a socialist and this isn't remotely true.  People's understanding of why different economic systems work has been very heavily warped by propaganda.  [Here, read this propaganda article!](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2012/12/the-red-and-the-black/)

    >The point is this: If a deterministic story about free markets generating optimal prices, leading to maximum output was no longer viable, then the failure of planned economies could hardly be attributed to the absence of those features. As Communist systems were collapsing in Eastern Europe, economists who had lost faith in the neoclassical narrative began to argue that an alternative explanation was needed. The most prominent theorist in this group was Joseph Stiglitz, who had become famous for his work on the economics of information. His arguments dovetailed with those of other dissenters from the neoclassical approach, like the eminent Hungarian scholar of planned economies, János Kornai, and evolutionary economists like Peter Murrell.
    >
    >They all pointed to a number of characteristics, largely ignored by the neoclassical school, that better accounted for the ability of market economies to avoid the problems plaguing centrally planned systems. The aspects they emphasized were disparate, but they all tended to arise from a single, rather simple fact:in market systems firms are autonomous.
    >
    >That means that within the limits of the law, a firm may enter a market; choose its products and production methods; interact with other firms and individuals; and must close down if it cannot get by on its own resources. As a textbook on central planning put it, in market systems the presumption is “that an activity may be undertaken unless it is expressly prohibited,” whereas in planned systems “the prevailing presumption in most areas of economic life is that an activity may not be undertaken unless permission has been obtained from the appropriate authority.” The neoclassical fixation with ensuring that firms exercised this autonomy in a laissez-faire environment — that restrictions on voluntary exchange be minimized or eliminated — was essentially beside the point.
    >
    >Thus, free entry and multiple autonomous sources of capital mean that anyone with novel production ideas can seek resources to implement their ideas and don’t face a single veto point within a planning apparatus. As a result, they stand a much greater chance of obtaining the resources to test out their ideas. This probably leads to more of the waste inherent in failed experiments — but also far greater scope for improved products and processes, and a constantly higher rate of technological improvement and productivity growth.

    In fact, the *original* Communist argument *in favor of* central planning was: "Look, the largest capitalist firms all operate on an *internal* basis of centralized, hierarchical planning, so clearly *the very success of capitalism* shows that central planning is the most efficient, effective way to do things!"

    Then the liberal-capitalist rebuttal to this was, "No, because only markets can generate optimal allocative efficiency."

    But the actual truth was, "Certain kinds of markets - namely markets with an egalitarian wealth distribution, easy entry/exit of firms, low economic rents, and low levels of moral hazard - enable many good and bad experiments to be tried in parallel, with the good receiving additional investment and revenue as it grows and the bad being cleaned up by bankruptcy."  This has a major implication for our current era of neoliberal authoritarian capitalism, in which increasing portions of social life are subjected to markets, but the *genuinely positive* features of capitalism are being *reversed*: capitalizing new firms outside the tech and FIRE sectors is increasingly difficult, bankruptcy is getting harder while debts are more stringently enforced, investment capital is getting concentrated into small cliques of de facto planners, economic rents are rising, and moral hazard is rampant.

    So to the list of things that Just Don't Work In an Irrational Society, we should add, "capitalism", because people kept trying to worship it as a god rather than understand what made it tick.

    Yes, though if the number of people who didn't do them were modest, but vocal and disruptive, they could still cause a rational system to fail.

    I do not think we would even recognize humans who could accept true communism.  Completely rational communism without dissent between the gifted and the non-gifted would basically make us a Borg analog.

    We have to account for irrationality whenever we determine what is possible.  Some rational ideas simply don't work because humanity cannot be rational enough to properly implement them.  Communism is one of those things.

    Banning addictive drugs that have the potential to harm others is another.  We've tried alcohol, and failed miserably.  We're struggling with tobacco.  The war on drugs is a laughingstock that only feeds money to international crime and terror networks.

A major problem with using the United States, for instance, as evidence to critique democracy, is that increasingly many available studies show that the United States is just not that democratic in the first place: only the top 10% by income/wealth measurably influence the government.

    >But people aren't rational, and now we've got Trump v. Clinton in a battle that will be decided primarily by old people in a minority of states.

    This is another superbly *bad* example, in that while Trump is a populist with broad support among his party, he's getting that support by using his wealth to spite the oligarchs of his own party.  While Clinton is an appointed politician-princess, and Clinton is pretty clearly more rational than Trump, *Clinton's party is spending its effort to ignore everyone who's not Clinton*.  This means that, for all of us who are more left-wing than Hillary Clinton - and this includes, say, the Barack Obama of 2007 who ran against her in the Democratic primaries - the *correct and rational choice* is one that the established system is too oligarchical to put before the public.

    So if you really think that, "People are irrational, and that's why we've got shitty candidates like Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump", you're ignoring the fact that a real, operative democracy might actually result in Bernie Sanders facing Ted Cruz or something.

    TL;DR: If you've got a system that's 70% oligarchy and 30% democracy, then your prior for blame for the faults of that system must be allocated 70% to oligarchy and 30% to democracy *until you see evidence that more oligarchy would have helped, and that means actually-existing oligarchy rather than philosopher kings or FAI.*

        You mean like in Switzerland?  Because that's more what people would point to for a close-to-ideal implementation of Democracy.

        It could just be that *Americans* suck.  Or perhaps that they've been spoiled as an educated, politically active citizenry by a thoroughly corporatized media, decades of repression of grassroots politics, and hundreds of years of party-machine politics.

  I had an example of this kind of idea while in the car.

  A kudos system you were able to use for incentivizing good driving of fellow drivers on the road by upvoting them when you saw them doing something safety conscious.

  My friends immediately pointed out this probably would just encourage a lot more crazy stunts for the 'likes'.

  Moderator's warning: this thread contains people being arrogant, smug bags of dicks.  Names will not be named, but seriously: if the problem with your gloriously "rational" idea is that *other people are too irrational for it*, then your arrogance may actually be the problem.

  Take, for instance, the popular image of immortalist-transhumanists...

  ~All ideas promoted by the freedom-loving right, that're opposed by the compassionate left.

  A person should be held accountable for their own health and family expenses, unfortunately people are not rational enough to save for emergencies, or to hold off from having children they can't afford.

  Ubiquity of guns should lead to a more polite society, unfortunately (I'm not american so I never looked into this, but IIRC <something to do with accident rates being terrible enough on their own, criminals not giving a fuck who's carrying and going on doing what they're doing in exactly the same way, but with more guns and more organization>)

  Idk I'm not that ensconsed in the american political binary, but I've noticed a general trend here. Others can probably think of others.

    If something fails because it doesn't take into account the limited capabilities of humans, can it really be called rational?

    It's easy to imagine policies that would work in a utopia. The hard part is coming up with policies that work in real life.

    Also, you might want to research the antebellum American south. From what I've heard, guns were ubiquitous (they still are but they used to be, too) and it was common for people to challenge each other to duels for any perceived slight. It would be interesting to see how "polite" that society was.

      Measured in the metrics of that time?  Extremely polite.  Because dueling was accepted.  You didn't mouth off to someone else aggressively unless you **really** meant it.  Today, people troll each other all the time, and I find that horribly rude.

      President Andrew Jackson was elected despite having won a duel which he walked away from with a bullet lodged inside him.  We'd probably find that moderately horrifying, but it clearly was acceptable to the US population in large part.

      The times change.  If I have my facts straight, the last fistfight in the US Senate was between Senator Strom Thurmond and Senator Ralph Yarborough in 1964.

      You say that as though it naturally follows that good men would settle their differences in mortal combat just because they carry mortal weapons. I suppose I can see why that might be, they carry these things around, they must attribute them some use, dueling is as good a use as any. But I wonder if you could erect a more stable culture. A culture where the gun is like the sikh kirpan, a symbol of adulthood, never to be used in anger(do not agree to a fight until both you and your opponent have disarmed), only in self defense, standing as a symbol of the adult's willingness to shed blood to defend the lives of their people. In peace times, the gun's purpose is to go unused, and in this sense it may also serve as a symbol of tact, and self-restraint.

      No.  "Unbounded" rationality results in paradox theorems.  You either have a finite amount of capability, or you have a finite number of levels of completed infinity.

    "All ideas promoted by the positive-sum left that are opposed by the zero- and negative-sum right."

    While it would be nice if people in general were capable of being held accountable for their own actions, they aren't. The government's job is to take economic surplus and use it to compensate for the population's inability to make good decisions.

    The problem with expecting people to be rational about health is that it by nature makes people irrational.  Take 10 people who all believe in total self support and personal accountability for health expenses.  Let's say they don't have much money.

    Let's say they all get injured.  Some percentage of them are going to seek care that they can't afford once confronted with the pain and risk of permanent disability. 

    Or to weaken their rational resolve even more, let's say it's their child or parent that gets injured. It's one thing to make a principled stand on your own health but are you really going to tell your 5 year old daughter that she gets to die of leukemia because Obamacare destroys freedom?  

    Of course not.  

    Sick people will always seek care, whether or not they can afford it. After all, it's the rational thing for them to do.  

    Society and government has to structure itself to provide that care at minimum cost to the rest of the society.   

    This can be through a single payer insurance system like Taiwan or Canada, it can be through a completely free system like the NHS.  It can be through Singapore's system which forces people to save 8~10% of their income and put it into an account that can only be used for health expenses. 

    But in all cases, the government has to force rationality.

      It helps that these socialized systems are *actually cheaper*, on a per-capita basis, than "Now everyone just save for expected expenses and let your permanently disabling injuries permanently disable you when they happen if you don't have the money!"

    Huh?  I mean, you do know that insurance is *the* mechanism designed to handle costly but improbable events, right?  "Accountability" isn't *magic*: it doesn't take the basic stochasticity out of the world that *forces* our decision-making to deal with uncertainty in the first place.

    >Ubiquity of guns should lead to a more polite society, unfortunately

    The word *should* is doing a mysterious lot of work there.
