## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

- u/Makin-:
  ```
  It was recommended [a couple of months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/b5bs7a/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/ejctgpv/) and it stayed in my backlog until recently, after reading the first book of **[Oh this has not gone well](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/61ya08/oh_this_has_not_gone_well/)**, I feel like I have to strongly recommend *against* reading it. I hope I reached any potential readers in time.

  This is the worst case of narrative enforced sunk cost fallacy I've ever read. 

  The story always makes you think the slog you're currently reading is the prelude to the actually good part up ahead, i.e. >!first reaching the magic school, then claiming the old guild hall, and finally the war!<, but once you get there it's all over in a couple scenes with noticeable worse writing. It makes this story more harmful than it would otherwise be, since the day-to-day writing is godawful, with some of the most generic and flat characters I've ever read, but there was always the dangling carrot of interesting plot developments hanging ahead to make me keep reading, until I reached the end of the first book and realized it was all for nothing.

  In retrospect, the author seems to solely use those parts of the plot as an excuse to write his self insert banging a bunch of fantasy girls, in fact >!I'm pretty sure he's been in five sexual relationships by the end of book 1!<. The fanbase encourages it, I've seen more comments about the shipping and encouraging sex scenes than I've ever seen about the munchkinry epic the story advertised itself as.

  The munchkinry is another poorly handled area. It started out alright, with the protagonist merely introducing some modern metalworking techniques, and using mathematics and physics to measure spell efficiency, but soon you get the classic isekai trademark of a smartphone with conveniently infinite knowledge, and he introduces modern guns, explosives, even home appliances (he keeps the tech private though, so you don't even get to see the uplifting). In the end, magic munchkinry falls by the wayside. 

  I could *really* go on, but this is still a recommendation thread so I guess I'll leave it there. To make this post somewhat productive I will mention the excellent and recommendable Mother of Learning/Worm/Naruto/Homestuck crossover [Conference Call](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/conference-call-multicross.682117/) just updated.

    That it's bad seems to be the consensus [around here](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/bdh129/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/ekysmws/). You've articulated why it sucks particularly well, though.
    ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Ya I had to stop reading it.  The fan service is annoying.  If you’re gona read it skip the nsfw tagged chapters.  The last thing I would note is it’s written for hfy so that is going to give it a particular flavor
    ```

    - u/DangerouslyUnstable:

        I had to stop reading it after the lesbian slaver became bi for the main character cuz he was just so hot.   The memories of creature 88 is the only thing on that sub that I’ve liked that was over a single post.

    ...that's a thing?
    ```

      ```
      As unusual as the combination sounds, it’s handled well and not a confusing and overwhelming mess (like you might expect if you’ve had the same experience I have with multi-cross stories).

      While it doesn’t seem strictly necessary to be familiar with all the source material, I’d recommend being at least somewhat familiar with Worm and MoL, and at least not completely unaware of the other two.
      ```

      - u/thrawnca:
        ```
        Hmm. Well, I've followed MoL avidly for years. I read about half of Worm (up to >!Bonesaw redecorating!<) before giving up on it, and I've read a lot of Naruto fanfics but not an iota of canon.

        Homestuck I don't know at all.
        ```

        - u/LucidityWaver:
          ```
          I had almost no prior knowledge of Homestuck before reading Conference Call. Mostly I knew that it has some level of absurdly advanced tech but not any details except a vague sense of dimensional shenanigans.

          Not really spoilers but kinda:
          >!The Homestuck portion of Conference Call follows, as I understand it, a minor character who appears in one segment of the story who was popular with fans. It pretty much tells you what you need to know as the story goes, but you would probably _get_ it more if you’re familiar.!<

          Admittedly, the Homestuck parts are the least well explained / described because >!of both the viewpoint character and the complexity of that universe. This does produce the right _feeling_; that the Homestuck universe seems bizarre from the outside.!<

          The author has gone out of their way to not only make knowledge of any of the settings not required, but has actually stated that they will not be introducing anything that could conceivably be considered "spoilers" from any of them.

          I personally think they've overcompensated a tad on that front, but I'm familiar with all 4 sources so I might be biased.

    I think Saya no Uta mostly fits. It's a lovecraftian horror visual novel written by r/rational's favorite anime writer: Gen Urobuchi. 

    Here's a link to a 3 year old discussion on it, if you're interested: https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3alroa/d_saya_no_uta/

  - u/LazarusRises:
    ```
    King's *The Stand* is a moderate fit here. Specifically Frannie and Stu are very rational agents. The plot is not at all rational, but there are smart characters for sure.

    Then there's Flagg, who is by nature and action anti-rational. Makes a great foil to the intelligent protags.
    ```

- u/wfcc6sZtfdf6gAg3VAAe:
  ```
  I’m looking for recommendations that taught you how to become more rational irl. It can be from any source (books, documentaries, apps, etc) as well as any topic (psychology, philosophy, economy, etc). It could even be tricks that you have figured out yourself. Greatly appreciated!
  ```

  - u/JanusTheDoorman:
    ```
    Yudkowsky's book, Rationality from A-Z is probably the best starting point, and Philip Tetlock's Superforecasting is probably the best book on actually making good predictions. Thinking Fast & Slow is a classic, but also a lot of the results it cites have since failed to replicate, so a companion piece like Re-Thinking Fast & Slow is recommended.

    I find game theory quite informative as well. I think there are a few high quality college courses on it that have been put on YouTube. Thomas Schelling's The Strategy of Conflict is good for going being the introductory stuff.

    Beyond that, I feel like getting more rational is more about front better domain specific knowledge than it is about better understanding belief formation and decision making. Duhigg's Smarter, Faster, Better is more pop self help than hard science but it's reasonably well researched.

    80,000 Hours Career Guide has a lot, lot of stuff that's generally applicable not just in professional life. Of particular value for me at least was Cal Newport's So Good They Can't Ignore You.

  I am looking for self-insert fanfiction. I felt like I read all of the good ones and there are thousands of them. The problem with self insert fanfiction is that it is riddled with crack, effortless powerups, mindless fix-it, and harems. Like it was almost *designed* to mainly have all those qualities, *sigh*. I want to read self-insert fanfiction that takes itself seriously and not for it to exist to troll canon characters. More like reading a cosmically kidnapped interdimensional survival guide and less like an OP omniscient god playing with everyone's fate. 


  Sure the self-insert fic can have comedy, fix-it arcs, powerups, and a harem but, only as long as it's moderate  and it comes through to the readers logically. Here is a quote by my favorite self-insert fanfic author, "Every fanfic is wish-fulfillment. The best written ones just make you believe it isn't."-Sir lucifer morning star.


  Here are my favorite self inserts. I would like to think I have good taste but some of these recs can make me seem like a hypocrite. Some fics have the SI to be OP(basically all gamer fics) but, I felt like the premises of the self inserts play out rationally and fairly given the situation. Note that I try to avoid stories with ROBs(random omnipotent beings) because they ruin all sense of narrative causality in a story. IE-*Who cares if I die in this new world. There is a confirmed afterlife. ROB will bail me out. Let me just have a fun adventure*.


  **Naruto Self-Inserts**.

  [Sanitize-](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12431866/1/Sanitize) Female SI, professional doctor reincarnated in the ninja warring clans era. Has no knowledge of Naruto. Very Slow updates.

  [Kaleidoscope- ](https://archiveofourown.org/works/10531500)
  Male SI, reincarnated as an Uchiha. He knows the culling is coming for him and his clan he must do everything to survive it. Complete.

  [Son of Gato- ](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12794658/1/Son-of-Gato) Male Villain SI, reincarnated with the gamer powers. It has NSFW harem/wish fulfillment but does a really good job showing power levels. I am rooting for the canon characters
  to shut the SI down in this fanfic. Slow updates.

  [Walk on Moon- ](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10779196/1/Walk-on-the-Moon) Female SI, Reincarnated as the yamanaka heir. Mixed feelings with this one but I felt like it deserves a recommendation because it's one of the few girl SIs that strive to become a S class ninja. Hiatus.

  [Wilted Irises- ]( https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/wilted-irises-naruto-si.52403/) Male SI, reincarnated as the hyuga heir. One of the only semi-realistic hyuga SIs out there. It reads like my favorite naruto self insert, kaleidoscope, but with way less angst. The only problem is that it has only 20k words and the author seemed to abandon it when it was picking up steam. Dead.

  [Sleight Advantage- ](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/sleight-advantage-naruto-reincarnation-si.37698/) Male SI, reincarnated as an average civilian. Joining the ninja academy he must make due with his below average chakra coils so he specializes in magic misdirection. Dead.

  [What doesn't Kill you-](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10264082/1/What-Doesn-t-Kill-You) Female SI, reincarnated as Orichimaru's supposed daughter. Has one of the most realistic and amazing Root induction scenes out there. I highly recommend just for this arc. Dead.

  [I opened my eyes and the world wasn't there-](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11358802/1/I-opened-my-eyes-and-the-world-wasn-t-there)Male SI, 65 year old well-educated mathematician reincarnated as a civilian orphan. Being notice for his high intelligence early on in life the self-insert gets conscripted to Konoha's intelligence division during the 3rd ninja war. Dead.

  [Pulling the strings-](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8974812/1/Pulling-The-Strings)
  Male SI, bodyswapped into Kankuro of the Sand. This self-insert is mainly slice of life which I tend to avoid in naruto fanfics because they are oversaturated, cliche, and a dime a dozen. But, with Pulling The Strings, it's a breath of fresh air because its a well-done slice of life in the sand village with the grand goal of liberating Gaara's madness. It woulda probably evolve into more but it died before getting anywhere. Dead.

  **Worm Self-Inserts**.

  [Stealing Fire-](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/stealing-fire-worm-si.31344/) Male SI, transmigrated into brockton bay and triggered as a human biology tinker. SI makes logical decisions given the circumstances. Hiatus.

  [Tyrant of the Bay-](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/tyrant-of-the-bay-worm-cyoa.14472/ )Reincarnated and later triggered as an overpowered alexandria. Has alot of wish fulfilment and fix-it but it builds up to it and doesn't come out of nowhere. Dead.

  [Going Native-](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/worm-going-native.17415/) Male SI, reincarnated and later triggered with the power to rewind time a couple of seconds. Very fun shard and makes a point to rationally avoid taylor to not butterfly the plot to earth bet's doom. Dead.

  **Young Justice/Dc comic self inserts.**

  [With this Ring- ](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-story-only.25076/) Male SI, transmigrated to the moon orbiting earth with an orange power ring. He proceeds to munchkin and deconstruct the dc universe. Fast updates.

  [Blink and you'll miss it.- ](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/blink-and-youll-miss-it-young-justice-si.648947/) Male Villain SI, transmigrated to gotham with a teleportation powerset from the movie, Jumper. Makes a name for himself. Hiatus.

  **Game of Thrones Self-inserts**.

  [A lion beyond death- ](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-lion-beyond-death-au-got-si.663742/) Male SI, bodyswapped into Jaime Lannister during the day of Mad king Aerys death. The SI does everything he can as the heir to the westerlands to prepare for the long night. Dead.



  [A fish out of the water- ](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12875401/1/A-Fish-Out-of-Water-ASOIAF-SI) Male SI, body swapped into Edmure Tully during king Jeoffry's Rule. Has no memories of Edmure so he has to improvise names of his closest friends not covered in the show. Truly a fish out of the water. Slow updates.

  [Son of Man(nis) an ASOIAF SI]( https://www.alternatehistory.com/forum/threads/son-of-man-nis-an-asoiaf-si.466801/ ) Male SI, Reincarnated into the first born son of Stannis Baratheon. You would need to create an alternatehistory account to read this story but is is well worth it. It is a technological uplift self insert and the author doesn't seem to pull the revolutionary technologies one out of the another from his ass. *Cough* Greyjoy alla breve *Cough*. The story has a slow realistic build up to them. It also does not fall into the trap of many ASOIAF self inserts where the SI problems seem non existant due to being reincarnated into a high society position. It is the most popular story on the site right now and the comment section of the thread is active filled with theorycrafting. Fast updates.

  **Harry Potter Self-inserts.**

  [Magical Me- ](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8324961/1/Magical-Me) Male SI body swapped into Professor Lockhart. With the knowledge of the future the SI strives to become an actually useful defense against the dark arts profesor. Dead.

  [Whats Her Name in Hufflepuff](https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13041698/1/What-s-Her-Name-in-Hufflepuff) Female SI transmigrated into a 10 year old version herself in the HP universe. There isn’t really any outright characteristic that makes this self insert stand out. It is just everything I was looking for of what would someone logically do being transmigrated to the HP universe. She rationalizes her decisions and she even delves into the topic of childishly arguing with her fellow preteen classmates, being a 30 year old woman, because of her now young hormonal body. Slow updates.

  **Star wars self-inserts.**

  [Paths of Ruin-](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/path-of-ruin-star-wars-si.541256/)
  Male SI, transmigrated as a slave in a mining vessel controlled by the sith empire. Honestly everything from Rictus, the author of this self insert, is good. He has like 7 different self inserts but this is his most popular and most fleshed out one. Fast updates.

  **DBZ Self-Inserts.**

  [Frost-](https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/frost-dragon-ball-si.6837/)
  Male SI, reincarnated as a frost demon the same alien race as Frieza. I highly recommend this self-insert. This is the most engaging and well-written DBZ self insert I found. The author does yearly time skips that gets the plot into the nitty gritty and skips the boring repetitive buildup a lot of self-inserts tend to have. You would need to make a NSFW questionable questing forum account but the funny thing is there is only one NSFW scene(suprising for this site) which is entirely skippable. Sadly Dead.

  **Bleach Self Inserts.**

  [Psychopomp (Bleach SI)](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/psychopomp-bleach-si.747151/) Male SI, reincarnated as a hollow millennia before canon. I was really suprised of the quality of this fanfiction especially coming from a bleach SI. The SI is reborn as a hollow where he struggles to find his purpose in this world as the anime already set the story's fate in stone. One of my major grip in self insert fanfiction in general is that every author ignores the golden question of whether to needle into the story and change the threads of fate. Most mediums with seemingly happy endings IE Naruto/bleach/harry potter seem to ignore this and still needlessly ingratiate themselves into the story where survival is iminent and their interference is not needed. The author of psychopomp does an amazing job answering this question and tells an amazing story with their SI defining it. Slow updates.

    [The Bastard of Highgarden \[ASOIAF\]](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-bastard-of-highgarden-asoiaf-si.746704/)

    SI as the bastard son of Stannis with a member of the Tyrell family. Personally my favourite ASOIAF SI (having tried your suggestions and some others), it focuses on a character who tries to do his best to save the world, deal with the problems that accompanies these attempts, all without setting him as an infallible god. The character makes mistakes and people call him out on them. Regularly updating, and with a pretty large backlog already built up.

    [Dragonspawn \[My Hero Academia\]](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/dragonspawn-my-hero-academia-si.696280/)

    I don't know if you've watched MHA (if you haven't you should, I think it's amazing) but this SI does a great job of integrating the main character into the world, creating a realistic progression, whilst still allowing her to have flaws and problems she needs to solve. SI as the younger sister of one of the top ten pro-heroes in the world, and features significant development of, and interaction with, the case of side-characters in the world.

    [Daedalus \[Worm\]](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/daedalus-worm-si.746287/)

    I... don't know what to think of Daedalus. It's competently written, and the power at least is interesting so far (though it is quite early days), but... The author doesn't shy away from showing that the SI (it's kind of not really an SI? Based on the author, but as an in-universe character) is a huge asshole. It's intentionally presented in this way, but half the enjoyment of this fic is cathartically hating someone you don't know.

    [A Better Class of Criminal \[DC\]](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-better-class-of-criminal-dc-si.394632/)

    A big favourite of mine. SI as a character in Gotham with the ability to summon fictional items from books - but it's set years into the future, with the SI as an established member of Batman's rogues gallery. Features attempts from the SI to go legit, creative use of a pretty powerful ability, great character interaction, and unorthodox challenges. Possibly dead, possibly just has really long breaks between updates.
    ```

    - u/Sonderjye:
      ```
      Dragonspawn is really well written for a SI. I'm a little disappointed about the lack of power exploration but I guess her power is fairly simple and that the MC doesn't do more with the advantage of having an extra life's worth of experience/knowledge.

      &#x200B;

      Also a better class of criminal seems to be fairly dead with the last update almost half a year ago.

  - u/Lightwavers:

    You likely know of [Worth the Candle](https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/25740126), which isn't technically *fan*fiction but instead uses fragments of the SI's world-building from various D&D campaigns. Extremely high quality.

    [I, Greg](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/i-greg-or-how-a-self-insert-destroyed-the-wormverse.365041/) is ... odd. I think the events have rational explanations, but the SI is almost a parody of himself. The author's summery goes:

    >A petty, self-obsessed teenager who is suspiciously similar to Greg Veder finds out that he is Greg Veder, circa 2010. Armed only with having read 2/3rds of Worm, absolutely no powers, and an extremely kidnappable puppy, Greg “Eric” Veder tries to survive in the face of the greatest foe Worm has to offer: the average teenage girl!

    More for DC Comics:

    [The Calculator](https://archiveofourown.org/works/11221623/chapters/25072989?view_adult=true) by TimeLoopedPowerGamer

    Male SI with DC comics knowledge discovers he's The Calculator. The story doesn't follow any particular arc from comics (that I recognize). Checks off the boxes for taking itself seriously, having a reason to exist instead of trolling canon characters, and the sort of mindset that types the words "interdimensional survival guide."

    We can debate over whether it is wish-fulfillment. (Although, per quoted framing, that just makes it one of the best ones.)  


    Also, it's complete! Loosely-related sequel pending.

    Bonus for anyone else reading: you do not need a terribly deep familiarity with the source. The pop-culture osmosis has done the work, unless you have no idea who Batman is or why you might not want his attention.

    Well since you're mention things from RRL, some of these may not be 100% rational lit:

    Have you read Worm? There's a fanfic called [I woke up as a Dungeon, now what?](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/i-woke-up-as-a-dungeon-now-what-dungeon-worm.620521/) which features Worm's Main Character from after the end of the book suddenly finding herself as the spirit controlling a classical adventure game Dungeon on a world that's based on RPGs.  

    So far, the fic hasn't involved the Worm parts overly much, remaining almost an entirely original work, but it does spoil the end of Worm.

    Politics and subterfuge are a big part of the story, and at least the one country we see explicitly is ruled by a very intelligent and cunning leader.

    [Twig](https://twigserial.wordpress.com/) by Wildbow is more biopunk than cyberpunk but it's pretty good.

  I've recently finished the WormFic Tabloid and I feel deeply bittersweet. The Fic itself is well written, interesting, and well rounded. The portrayal of office life and politics is a high point. The characters are eminently believable, complex, with tight snappy diologue. 

  It is bittersweet because the story ends, and ends conclusively. Worm itself creates an amazingly potent world, with a ton of depth and breadth. Tabloid does a great job of filling out it's particular corner of the Wormiverse.

  Worm was one of the first serial fics I ever read, before I discovered this site. I believe I made it through Arc 17 before throwing in the towel. I gave up because I found the story too angsty, too negative, too depressing. Every plan made, every step forward, seemed to be stomped into the mud and laughed at, while the helpless civilians die by the score. While the story was prolific, the writing proficient (or better), I simply didn't enjoy the pain and suffering depicted in the story.

  It pains me to finish quality WormFics because I know that they are over, and that the main corpus is soooo much larger yet so much less enjoyable.

  Is it worth it giving Worm another try? How about any of Woldbow's other fics? Are there any essential WormFics outside of Tabloid or A Bad Name?

    [Glassmaker](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/glassmaker-worm-complete.433391/) is something everyone who has tried Worm should read. The prose is something special, and the tone is way lighter. Also it's complete.

    The [Cenotaph](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/cenotaph-worm-complete.273255/) trilogy is often regarded as an "essential" fic, because it is very true to the tone of canon, which might turn you personally off of it. I feel it has several more decisive wins for Taylor, though; you might find it more bearable.

    Taylor's distorted perception colored the world darker than it actually needed to be, in my opinion. When Ward's main character looks back at her life in those days, it's way less dour. One interlude taking place in 2013 is downright sweet for a bit.  
    [Twig](https://twigserial.wordpress.com/) has the opposite effect; objectively the world is even more of a hope-deserted shithole than Bet, but the main character is having *so much fun* scheming and fighting and betraying and strategizing, it actually becomes enjoyable.

    I'd' say give it another shot, or just listen to We've got Worm a great podcast that covers and analyzes the story arc by arc. One host is new to the work and the other is rereading.

    Since you asked, I'm gonna unrec Pact by Wildbow. The concept and universe are amazing, and yet it crosses the Darkness-Induced Audience Apathy threshold in the first quarter, and yet manages to sink to new levels of misery till the bitter end. It really puts the glasses to Worm, and that's saying something.

    The only good worm fic I can remember which isn't dead is Ring-Maker: https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/ring-maker-worm-lord-of-the-rings-alt-power.517894/reader

    Putting Sauron in Taylor's body sounds like a silly concept that would never work. It does work.

      Having just checked out this fic from this recommendation, this is an entirely accurate summary.

      It suffers a bit from the main character being too powerful and versatile, IMO, but is otherwise good.

    It’s probably worth reading arc 18, at least. Honestly, I don’t remember it feeling like there was a lot of losing, just a lot of loss.

    Just remembered, if you enjoyed Tabloid, you might like [Birds of a Feather](https://archiveofourown.org/works/15996890/chapters/37322936), the Harry Potter fanfic by the same author, where Hermione and young Tom Riddle strike up a friendship in 1940ies London.
