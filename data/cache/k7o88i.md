  Brainwash me until the next 4 arcs are done, then lets see where this story is at.

    So...see you in 1 year?  Arcs are, in my estimation, about 12-18 chapters.

  I wasn't thrilled with this update. It definitely had that meandering feel to it of an update going over the same ground again, even though objectively some things happened I guess. It's just they were mainly cleanup sorts of things .

  Is giving the accolade to Tarny really doing anything useful besides making him feel better? Without an interface he probably can't progress the skill, and even if he could it wasn't going to fit in his planned build anyway.

  Doesn't Ice Girl still need to swap a skill into something to get her class? I was wondering if it's Ice Bolt. Might be too convenient.

    Making him feel better isn't a bad thing, he can always pass the accolade on later. Also, I think he can progress the skill.

    She already has Ice Bolt

    Eh, one more person with magic arguably has more tactical value than making an existing mage slightly more versatile. (As long as no special class unlocks are not involved.) But I think making him feel better was the main point.

      I really don't think Rain has any use for the skill. I assume a level 0 skill has pathetic damage compared to his auras. So, it makes perfect sense why he'd give it away.

      Also, maybe it's possible for the unawakened to keep swapping it to each other when one runs out of mana? If yes, then that seems like a pretty valuable asset.
      ```

      - u/TheColourOfHeartache:
        ```
        It's not just pathetic damage, wearing armour screws up a mage's aim. Rain gets around that because a 360 degree aura can't go off target but for him ice bolt was useless.
        ```

  Considering how no one got any accolades, but Stint did, I theorize that Stint counted for double. To awaken and get an accolade, he needed twice the amount of essence. But that worked out fine due to there only being 7 members total in the party in the Dark Lair, so Stint was permitted to take up two "slots" for an awakening and an accolade. However this time, every slot was accounted for with 7 awakenings and 1 earning an accolade for 8 slots total.
  ```

  - u/DoubleSuccessor:
    ```
    Did we ever find out what Stint's cap was? I thought he was capped at 0 or 1 or something like that but I forget.
    ```

    - u/xamueljones:
      ```
      Stint was capped at level 5 which was the same level as the lair. But Rain is unsure if everyone who awakens by smashing the core are automatically given a cap of level 5, or if the cap matches the lair's level.

  ```
  Just gonna not read this for a month or so, let it build up couple of chapters. Any good worm fanfics?

  ```
