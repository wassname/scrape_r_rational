  Is Rain gunning for five rank ten skills in each of his five skill trees to get access to a legendary class? 

  If so, barring a new hidden skill revealing itself, I'm guessing they're going to be Shear, Shroud, Corrosion, Arcane Ward, Light Ward, Mental Ward, and Suppression. 

  The logic is like this, the distribution is 3 skill points to offensives and 4 to defensive. Rain would want Suppression since it synergizes extremely well with his high mana, but that requires an aura of each of the 8 elements. Rain already has heat, cold, and force.

  Of all the possible combinations, it comes down to Rain needing less chemical resistance due to Purify, so he'll take that element in the offensive form of Corrosion, which also requires shroud. The last offensive point goes to Shear as it has a unique tactical quality in that it isn't occluded by mundane materials. Radiance doesn't give Rain anything special as Purify can produce light as well.

  3 defensive skill points go for the mental, arcane, and light wards, completing the requirements allowing Rain to spend his 25th skill point on Suppression.

  WDYT?

    Rain already has 6 points in Aura Metamagic, so by level 24 he'll have to drop Shear (or Suppression, if he's nuts), which he'll pick up at level 25.

      Right! I missed that. So it won't be a perfectly even spread at level 25... But still *at least* five of five. I guess that's a non-issue since it's impossible anyway unless you hold off on allocating a skill point before choosing a class, and we haven't seen any hidden requirements so far that would suggest that to be an issue.

  I mean nice, but I'd prefer if we had less action and more progress in the story. IT's nice to see things from other fighters perspective tho.

    I dunno, I was pretty happy to get an exciting fight scene instead of more "eating because getting magically buff" and custom fitting armor and blah blah blah.

      Same. And Rain has (probably) leveled up!
      ```

      - u/eaglejarl:
        ```
        He probably didn't level up yet. He's had his cap increased but will need to earn the XP for the levels. That's pretty trivial for him, since he gets XP simply for spending mana. A few days at most and he'll be at his cap, regardless of what his cap is.
        ```

        - u/LLJKCicero:
          ```
          Right, right.
          ```

      Yeah fair enough i guess we enjoy different things. At least the author is catering to all.

  In a world of people with superpowers, Amelia has the ultimate superpower of being able to switch around her entire build.  Yet galaxy brain Amelia still refuses to swap out her fire based build in a fire biome.

  I'm sure the Message "nice shot" was also a necessary and calculated expenditure of mana mid battle.
  ```

  - u/eaglejarl:
    ```
    This was addressed a chapter of two back. She doesn't want to swap her build around because it takes too long -- 8 hours per point, I think? Her fire damage is reduced against fire creatures but she does so much that it doesn't matter. 

    Additionally, she doesn't get to swap randomly, only to things she's unlocked. None of the non-fire skills we've seen her use in the past are damage-dealing.

    Finally, I'm not sure how much mana Message takes but I doubt it's very much, and she's got Rain using Essence Well on her. She can afford to waste a handful of points.

        *checks wiki*

        Right you are. My bad.
        ```

    - u/Rorschach_And_Prozac:

      Yeah, so she would need to change fireball and meteor. She could keep chanting and triplicate and airwalk and brace, and literally everything else we've seen. If she's a jack of all trades who hasn't unlocked ANY other damage type besides fire, then she's even dumber than I thought. Just change the damage spells.

      Good thing the aberrants they ran into in the fire biome weren't fire type aberrants, huh? What a lucky break. Because they didn't want to take the time to do the vastly more intelligent option of switching to a better damage type. 

      I'm sure it would have been great comfort to the person she's supposed to be protecting down there that they saved 1 day of delving time as he roasted to death against a level 24 blue fire elemental that Amelia can't even damage.

        You might have skipped the part where she’s loaded with a bunch of fire boosting skills (Fire affinity, Heat Mastery, etc, etc). Just switching Fireball with, let’s say, Rockbomb, would be a waste without the various metamagics she has to boost that type of magic. And for higher leveled spells like Meteor it’s even worse, since she also needs to worry about the prerequisites. 
        I do think she should’ve taken the time to switch to something else, but they decided time was of the essence and since the Rank of the area was just 15, it shouldn’t be a problem for her to just overpower everything with with the Force aspect of her fire spells. It’s been a recurring thing in the story that areas keeps turning out more dangerous than they should, at some point they should start taking that into consideration.

  ```
  Why 'poor Rain' though? I feel like I'm missing something. He contributed to the kill on a blue above his level; that's what raises his cap, isn't it?
  ```

  - u/Sakul_Aubaris:
    ```
    I believe it's because he's one level short of silver rank with his new max level.
    ```

    - u/bigbysemotivefinger:
      ```
      After being unable to level *at all* for so long, I doubt he'll see it that way...
      ```

  - u/MilesSand:
    ```
    I think SS is acknowledging the peanut gallery with that.  There's a skill that's supposed to bring the whole build together, and Rain has all the prerequisites, but he's not taking it until level 26 because he thinks he can get a better class at 25 by having 5 skills from 5 branches.
    ```
