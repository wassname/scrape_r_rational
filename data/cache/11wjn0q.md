## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  The author of the absolutely fantastic [To the Far Shore](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/50836/to-the-far-shore), a novel that's been highly recommended here multiple times, has a new story. 12 chapters (~20k words) out so far.

  [Slumrat Rising](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/65801/slumrat-rising) is a system based cultivation novel set in a dystopian cyberpunk world.

  Author Summary

  > There is no future in being a thug with a spell.  But that's all the slums are offering Truth Medici, and even that would be considered winning.  You could hold your head up high if you managed to be a thug with a spell.  You might even live to see thirty.  Not like the people living in the glittering magical metropolis that makes up the rest of Harban City.  With their bound demons, and flying carpets and angelic weapons.  They probably don't have parents who steal your money and try to sell you and your siblings into slavery.  Or have to hide from nightmarish things that hate the light but love making art from still living materials.  Or the gangsters, pimps and dealers that infest every corner of the slums, just waiting for you to slip. 
  > 
  > Some of the blessed rich of Harban even have the System.  The System that guarantees wealth, power, status.  The System that can turn an ordinary person into a Demigod.  Power you have to fight for.  And if there is one thing Truth knows how to do, it's fight!
  > 

  Despite what might be the most mash of the most cliche trending RR story concepts, it does a great job with them. The main character starts off in a grim situation with terrible excuses for parents and wants to achieve the unthinkable, to be a maintenance worker for a giant mega corporation fixing objects like streetlights. Why? 

  Because the megacorp can provide basic food, shelter and education for him and his siblings. 

  He has a sense of morality. Does he do bad things? Yes, but not willingly and he tries to stick to his sense of a code. He might not be a priest, but he tries to be a good person and maybe the biggest thing is that just that he simply tries not be a bad person. 

  He also has emotions. Not even emotions in the abstract sense. He actually displays them in the story. He truly cares for his siblings. He tries his best to help them. He offers advice. He actually listens to their thoughts.

  There isn't much so far, but just based off of how good To the Far Shore was and how good this is so far, I'm really excited. I hope you find it entertaining as well.

  I want to recommend two great [Prototype](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Prototype) crossfics that ~~I haven't seen mentioned here before~~ have rarely been mentioned here so far. Both have great worldbuilding, character designs, character interactions, and hive mind solutions. Both also have very detailed designs and descriptions of [Blacklight](https://prototype.fandom.com/wiki/Blacklight_virus) as a setting variable.

  1) *[Variant Strain](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8642442/1/Variant-Strain)* [55-88][325K WL][complete] (Prototype x Spider-Man)

  Drawback: there are ~3–5 bad decisions that prot makes throughout the story.

  Other than that, I'd say it's pretty rational. Also features organic tech that's being developed by Spiderverse corporations, and in this sense shows how Spiderverse gradually reacts / adapts to the introduction of something like Blacklight. 

  It also has an exquisite vocabulary (and above-average prose). One of the rare stories (fanfic or not) that manages to use "SAT vocabulary words" not just for the sake of form to fill in a story quality tickmark, but where they actually *are* contextually good / relevant fits to use.

  2) *[Biomass Effect](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10602465/1/Biomass-Effect)* [49-85][~350K WL][slow WiP] (Prototype x Mass Effect)

  This one is different from all the other Prototype fanfics in that its MC!Mercer *starts* with endgame-Prototype power-levels. I.e. power-wise, Mercer / Blacklight have already consumed the entire planet and its population by the time this crossfic's first chapter kicks in.

  However, this also leads to what I'd call a drawback: as with many other such over-powered entities in fiction, Mercer here is depicted as somewhat whimsical to allow for plot tension and progression. He's a species / government / economy upon itself, but he fails to properly take advantage of this to promote his interests on the galactic scene. This is handwaved away with him saying he doesn't *have* that many interests left, but as we see later on he does; and he would've been catatonic or at least isolationist if that were not the case.

  Another drawback that this leads to is that for many plot arcs he ends up being his own enemy. I.e. he reveals critical info about himself to ME inhabitants, and later on it gets used against him. Or refuses to leverage his unique position / abilities to abuse the intergalactic economy saying he doesn't have an economy, and then proceeds to default to barter exchanges when he does end up needing something. Or some narrative shenanigans happen, and he suddenly has to figure out how to solve a problem that got created due to his own existence / negligence in the first place, etc.

  That being said, it's still a great crossfic with a rarely-seen premise that's not being tame about veering off of the canon stations. It also manages to capture the spirit of Mass Effect Codex entries really well, using them to introduce various organic technology solutions created by Mercer / Blacklight.

    As far as Prototype goes, I'll take the chance to also mention [Maybe I'm A Lion](https://forums.nrvnqsr.com/showthread.php/1870-Maybe-I-m-a-Lion-%28KnK-Prototype-Crossover%29), a crossover with KnK Fateverse. Lots of mercenaries, secret government agencies, and black-ops experiments colliding with FATE magic. I went into the story knowing nothing about the KnK side of things and still had a lot of fun.

    I remember enjoying [A Dead World](https://fanfiction.net/s/8601250/1/A-Dead-World), 588k words. The story is thoroughly dead at this point, but I enjoyed reading Mercer's adventures in the New Vegas countryside.

  For anyone else who prefers to read in large blocks rather than chapter-by-chapter, the epilogue to book 4 of [12 Miles Below](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/42367/12-miles-below) released a couple of days ago. The story has been recommended here several times before so I won't go into why you should read it, but it's still quite good.

  [The Zombie Knight Saga](https://thezombieknight.blogspot.com/) returned from its latest hiatus in January! I read it for the first time this past week and could not put it down! Reasonably rational characters that take action based on their motives and values. No one's really left holding the idiot ball. Characters with powers based on physics/chemistry, and relevant munchkinry, with deus ex machina as an explicit feature of the power system. There's a big world that feels consistent and reasonably well thought out. The world is referenced and delivered in parts as the scope of the story grows
  ```

  - u/cthulhusleftnipple:
    ```
    I've read the first couple arcs, and I have to say I'm just really not seeing the appeal. Does the quality significantly change as it progresses?
    ```

    - u/Jarwain:
      ```
      So like vol 1?

      Vol 2 is where you start getting more interesting fight scenes, but you get to see some real powerhouses using their abilities in interesting ways in vol3. More generally, in vol3 the scope really starts to broaden and you start seeing more of the world & relevant factions
      Hector generally undergoes a lot of growth throughout the rainlord arc, both in power and character.

      But yeah imo vol 1 was the slowest but it picks up after that. You get a ton of world building too if you're into that kinda thing.
      ```

    - u/Ricardias:
      ```
      Short answer: Yes.

      Long Answer: Zombie Knight was first written over a decade ago. The first arcs while well plotted are pretty badly executed in the details and the writing itself. 

      Over the years the writer had improved a lot and I am fan of current product, which is still occsiuonally rough is better than most webnovels in most areas but it does take a while to get there. 

      If you can persevere then there might be a great time in it for you but you'll have to get through the weeds to get there, if your uncertain whether its worth it or not there is a decent Zombie Knight wiki, if your not afraid of spoliers maybe look up the magic system and see how it appeals to you.

  I would love for some genuinely good isekai adventure stuff similar to grimgar of fantasy and ash.  I want low powered struggles, possibly a system, etc.  but I would like it to earnestly engage with this idea.  I wouldn’t mind system abuse but I really don’t want anyone overpowered

    I recommend World of Prime series
    https://www.goodreads.com/series/129874-world-of-prime

    It is an Isekai written by a western. The protagonist ends up in a world with DnD 3.0 rules. Quite an interesting interpretation of how a society with those rules would work.

    It stays low level most of the time except the last book.

      I loved the first couple books of World of Prime, very nice slow buildup, but the last book was a shitshow. The plot kinda just resolved itself, and then kept going in a direction that wasn't really hinted at earlier at all. To this day I seek information on what caused the author to do that.

  Found and following [A Young Girl's Nuclear Armageddon](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-young-girls-nuclear-armageddon-youjo-senki-highfleet.1076673/#post-90730419) by miraage1.

  A youjo senki/highfleet crossover that started this month (28k words). The quality of the writing is great, the worldbuilding is fantastic and the plot is extremely intriguing. The story still somewhat follows the standard Youjo Senki misunderstanding hijinks fanfic story premise, but it's a lot more than that. 

  Unlike nearly all Youjo Senki fanfics, Being X is not forgotten. The story sets up Tanya's conflict with Being X, to be the real primary conflict in the story. It also does this in a way that doesn't make the conflict a seeming complete exercise in futility. Since normally a regular human fighting a God or an interdimensional being of incomprehensible power is a direct conflict that is hard to feel much tension from. It also does this in such a ingenious method. 

  I don't want to spoil anything, but will say that Tanya's conversation with her mother in chapter six where she indirectly explains her disdain for Being X is fantastic. Explains just why she picked and continues on this weird fight at all. Really can't wait to see how this story develops.

  Hey guys! Just wondering if you have any recs for stories featuring future shock of some kind? By which I mean the protag is faced with a world that is nearly beyond their comprehension, and so they're left as something of a temporal fish out of water. Kinda like that old man from Shawshank Redemption who couldn't handle how fast life was on the outside with all the bustling and cars. But even more so if that's possible.

  A good example would be Stanislaw Lem's [Return from the Stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_from_the_Stars), where astronauts return to an Earth over 100 years in the future due to time dilation. Lem does an excellent job cultivating an atmosphere of alienation here, and he succeeds in making Earth seem entirely like an alien world.

  EDIT: Also it would be neat if some of the recs were about such a world from the perspective of the reader. Like throwing the reader in media res and exposing them to all kinds of weird future terms through the POV of the experienced protag. They then have to try to figure it out through context - the farther in the future it is, the better!

    Classic SF book [The Forever War](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21611.The_Forever_War) is pretty much all about that. It's about an interstellar war that lasts thousands of years, and the MC and fellow enlistees experience it all by virtue of time dilation. Great book.
    ```

    - u/netstack_:
      ```
      If this is the one I'm thinking of, it started as a nicely plotted short story. That might actually be public domain by now...

  - u/chiruochiba:
    ```
    The comic book series [Transmetropolitan](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Transmetropolitan) might fit.

    It's a cynical story set in a cyberpunk future. Science has advanced to the point that consumers have ready access to cloning, mind uploading, genetically altering themselves to not be human, AI, nanomachines, matter replicators as basic household appliances... And yet the story often feels like it's only 20 minutes into the future because, despite the ubiquitous technology, inner city slums are still filled with abject poverty while society at large focuses on either cults of personality or the spiraling drain that is ethics in politics.

    In particular, [Issue #8 "Another Cold Morning”](https://comicsalliance.com/the-issue-transmetropolitan-another-cold-morning/) follows the experience of a celebrated 20th century photojournalist who was cryogenically frozen at the end of her life. She gets revived from cryosleep at long last and, like most other "Revivals", is completely unable to process the loud, fast, crass world that has forgotten her generation ever existed. We get to see the world from her perspective as she steps out of the revival facility for the first time.

    Fair warning, Transmetropolitan is filled with in-your-face vulgarity and crude humor, but if that's not a complete turnoff then you may find that it has a lot of heart in great stories. Issue #8 is one of the best in the series in my opinion, though extremely bleak.

      - u/RetardedWabbit:

        >"no user serviceable parts within" 

        Likewise. This also contributed to my belief that things would be clear, standardized, and specialized out of my understanding. Then I got into industry and learned that everything is slapdash up and down the chain practically everywhere lol.

    The classic example is 3001: The Final Odyssey, where Frank Poole from Clarke's 2001 gets thawed out in the titular year and wanders about it.

    From Heinlein, there's For Us, the Living, where a man from 1938 is suddenly transported to a speculative 2086. The book itself actually took a similar journey, being written in 1938 and only published in 2003. The leading lady of the novel who shows the protag around is essentially a streamer/influencer.

    There's also Dennis E. Taylor's Bobiverse series where a modern guy wakes up from cryofreeze to become a spaceship in the distant future.

    It's not technically future shock, but Ledeje Y'breq in Iain M. Banks' Surface Detail has a pretty analogous experience with her introduction to The Culture.

    [The Unincorporated Man](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4025200-the-unincorporated-man) is about a terminally-ill billionaire who is cryopreserved and awakens approximately 300 years later to find that things are rather different.

        &#x200B;

        The universe hopping through dungeons is a fun concept, and explains a lot of things in the setting, from biology, to politics (with hidden multidimensional empires influencing things) and potential apocalyptic threats like the cold minds.

          > There are very few stories that have what the op wanted. As seen from the fact that +90% of the other recs are fanfiction, which the op specified he doesn't want.

          Obviously. Asking what to follow up MoL with is like asking "what's next after the Superbowl?" 

          There's Pale (just skip past any mention of "therapy" or the more cringe bits of Avery chapters, >!up until Avery moves to Thunder Bay, which is where I put the story down for now.!<) Arcane Ascension (although that has its own set of problems), The Dresden Files (Grave Peril to Changes, at least). None of them are particularly rational though.

      Soft derec for Paranoid Mage, the author is writing by the seat of his pants, with every part of the worldbuilding being retconned in the moment the writer thinks of it.

    Max Gladstone: The Empress of Forever. Scifi. About as /r/rational as anyone could wish. Also very good. Standalone, 19.5 hours. 

     Tamsyn Muir : The Locked Tomb trilogy: Useless Lesbian Necromancers In Space. Gothic as all hell. Good stuff.

    Arkady Martine's: Teixcalaan Series. Duology, Sci-fi with a strong focus on diplomacy and skullduggery. Excellent stuff. Complete.

    Seth Dickinson Baru Comorant: Fantasy: Even More Intrigue, the Series. Dark. 

     Jacqueline Carey... Well, just in general  Jacqueline Carey. Santa Olvia is a personal favorite.

    Naomi Noviks the Scholomance series just completed and is excellent.

    I'm sure this is the hottest take ever on this subreddit, but whenever I've been on a plane I've always really enjoyed Big Bang Theory in a way I can't when I'm on the ground. It's a terrible show but something about the fact it's 20 minutes long, doesn't require you to think, has zany characters who stay in their lanes, and is very, very consistent makes it seem to me to be the perfect airplane show. Plus there's a bit of a story arc but it's easy to follow and you're not going to care if you tune out for half an episode, which you might if you're consuming "good" content. 

    Basically: You don't have to pay attention. You just have bright colours in your eyes and get to go "hahaha the tall guy said bojangles". 

    So yeah, it has 10 seasons, and I recommend it with the caveat that you have to be on a plane and wanting to turn your brain off (for me personally I use it in the last ~2 hours of a 15-20 hour journey).

    More on the rational side or on the "make time fun side"?

    I mean, there certainly are overlaps, but I don't mind guilty pleasure trash on the commute sometimes. 

    Anyway. 

    Dresden Files - not especially rational but it's what in listening to right now and it's fun. If the first one is too meh, read plot summaries of the first two or three and start there. Not much you miss but it really gets going after. 

    Mother of Learning - the obvious choice. And last arc comes out soon! 

    If you know German: Die Zwerge von Heitz. It loooooong. Fantasy much. Rational meh. 

    Origin of species has a few chapter recorded. 

    All of the Discworld books. Lots of material, the narration is generally really good and damn fun. And all the other good reasons for Discworld. 

    That's what comes to my mind right now. I'm also looking forward to suggestions you'll get cause once I'm through Dresden files I'm gonna run out again xD

  Any recommendations for historical-ish fiction that focuses on someone modern getting "isekai'd" to the past (our past or some fantasy past) but that tries to play it straight in terms of "realism"? Keyword might be "Isekai deconstruction"?

  More specifically, I don't want it to be easy for the protagonist--no being born into fantastical wealth, nobility, or otherwise "cheat powers"--some actual "human history is suffering" please. I'd like it if there were a focus on real historical society and culture eg with how unfathomably impossible upward mobility was for the average peasant, realities of slavery, etc. 

  Too much of what I find, particularly in the fantasy genre devolves into powerwankery, and in the alt-history genre, there's often a bigger focus on titillating history nerds, usually to the detriment of good characters and plot. 

  Some good adjacent examples to what I'm looking for are *[The Gilded Hero](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/29286/the-gilded-hero)*, Neal Stephenson's *Baroque Cycle*, and maybe [*My Absolutely Incredible Astonishing Super-Amazing Life As Someone In Another World Is Absolutely and Unquestionably Beyond Reproach...It Sucks.*](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/my-absolutely-incredible-astonishing-super-amazing-life-as-someone-in-another-world-is-absolutely-and-unquestionably-beyond-reproach-it-sucks.68737/)

    Lest darkness fall, one of the first "isekais". 1920s Historian working in Rome gets teleported to Rome in the 4th century iirc. He has nothing, is an adult man that can barely speak the language with a strong accent, and looks foreign to the natives. 

    &#x200B;

    He does some basic uplift, but from the perspective of a 1920s guy, which is quite alien. So you get the double the culture shock, part of it from the setting being late roman culture and early christian church nonsense, and the other is the mc being a normal 1920s guy like the author.

      > He does some basic uplift, but from the perspective of a 1920s guy, which is quite alien.

      The original novella version was published in December 1939, so a "1930s guy".

      The author, L. Sprague de Camp, was one of the founding fathers of rational fiction. Not only did he tirelessly champion rationality and the scientific method in his many articles in SF magazines, but he also co-wrote some of the earliest "rational fantasy" stories ("Incomplete Enchanter") with Fletcher Pratt.

    [Sengoku Komachi Kuroutan](https://mangadex.org/title/a4304d3b-191d-471f-8c78-353d403a35d0/sengoku-komachi-kuroutan-noukou-giga) doesn't quite fit your request, since it gives the heroine as many starting advantages as possible (e.g. her school bag just happens to contain a very relevant history book and a variety of modern high-yield crop seeds). It does, however, portray Japan in the 1500s in a fairly unflinching way, not sanitizing history nearly as much as usual. The most recently translated manga chapter, for instance, shows corpses being piled up *en masse* atop wood pyres because Kyoto's crematoria were overwhelmed by a measles outbreak.

    (I say *fairly* unflinching, mind you. In the real world, I would expect their clothes to have been salvaged before throwing the bodies on the fire, unless they were really worried about contamination. Textiles were labor-intensive to make back then.)

    The Man Who Came Early is a short story which is along the same lines, even if it doesn't explore the themes as much as you might want.

  I read shadow slave which got recommended last week and it was enjoyable enough. It got trope heavy mid way through but the world was still interesting to read into and explore. Anyone who has previously read it have recommendations in a similar vein ?
