        The original meaning of "despot" is "absolute ruler." But I don't think he's the ruler, just a high ranking official or noble.

        - u/Empiricist_or_not:
          ```
          Oops I meant demagogue. In the strong leader and that it started with good connotation but now has a bad connotation. I dunno if the lich is much of an orator.

              You might check the origin, if I remember right it came from a well liked senator coming to power as an orator. My original comment was meant most in the way Z had missed about the lich having been a honorable man by the bloodthirsty standards of his time.
              ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      I think he fits the definition of murderous, whatever else you want to say about him. He's sociopathic, it's just that you can reason with him.
      ```

      - u/clohwk:
        ```
        I don't think he goes around killing people for fun. IIRC, he has reasons when he kills.

        Is he sociopathic? AFAIK, many people in leadership positions are sociopathic to some extent.

        In any case, sociopaths are always reasonable. Selfish reasons, it's true, but so long as you don't get in their way, they can always be reasoned with. Of course, you still need to be careful of a knife in the back. 

        The unreasonable ones are the emotional people, the hysterical ones and the so-called good samaritans. The emotional ones act on their whims and fancies and are often hard to predict. The hysterical ones act out of their fears, misunderstandings and delusions. Even when they seem calm and reasonable, you never know when they'll suddenly explode.

        Many good Samaritans actually act for their own self-satisfaction. They'll always say it's for your own good and force their help on you. But very often, they don't really care about the results. They may often abandon the task halfway, leaving you hanging and your schedule in shambles. Or force you to accept their help/advice now, because it's always so urgent and important, forcing you to abandon your existing plans and projects which are actually better than what they want for you. Even if there is no direct cost to you, they often don't care who they trample or sacrifice in the process. If/when shit happens, they have all kinds of excuses lined up - karma for Buddhists, God's Will for Christians, you/no one told them, etc.
        ```

        - u/None:
          ```
          I don’t think you need to find killing fun to be considered murderous, also those that find it fun have their reasons too, such as “it’s fun” which is arguably just as valid as “they were in my way while I was trying to gain world domination”. They’re equally detestable in my mind. I also think there is some evidence he does find killing at least somewhat fun.
          ```

          - u/clohwk:
            ```
            I believe the reason for killing to be important. If done for a proper objective or as part of a strategic goal, or when there is legal backing, it should not be considered murderous. Otherwise, soldiers in war and executioners of death row prisoners would have to be classified as murderers.

            I'd argue that the lich doesn't kill without reason, as far as I can remember. He might have killing intent against his targets, or feel murderous rage facing his attackers, but that doesn't make him murderous.

            That said, the word murder and the variants derived from it have too much emotional luggage attached and the detailed meanings seem to vary in different contexts. E.g. many pacifists seem to consider all forms of killing humans to be murder, even in self-defense or when legally sanctioned, even when the killer isn't even human. In legal terms, the definitions are more precise and I think the emotions are excluded. While in literature, the meaning is whatever the author thinks he can get away with in order to dramatize his writings even more.
            ```

            - u/None:
              ```
              It’s a muddy definitional pool definitely, and words like “murderous” are even harder to put in a box
              ```

              - u/a_sensationist:
                ```
                Just my take on this, but I believe that he is murderous just by the definition of it.

                **a:** having the purpose or capability of murder

                **b:** characterized by or causing murder or bloodshed

                [(Merriam-Webster)](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/murderous)

                Therefore he's murderous in some sense of the word - but I do believe that the reason for killing is important, but not relevant for our discussion about being murderous or not.

    Them talking was a long time coming too.  QI actually has a lot to gain by partnering up with Z and Z, it was about time that Zorian reached out.
    ```

- u/KingofAcedia:
  ```
  So Zorian's Plan with the mental landscape is to trick Zach into thinking everyone who knows about the loop is dead, right? We know it's based on his perception due to how he determines who to kill and who to mind-wipe, I can't think of any other reason to train this ability at the last moment.  


  Edit: Also, We know that it is fairly lifelike Spear of Resolve knew because she was paying attention and is an expert at mental enhancement, but it shouldn't be able to fool Soul Sight, should it? So that means it will have little practical purpose in battle, considering who they're up against, but Soul Sight is an active ability, so Zach probably wouldn't have it activated all the time.
  ```

  - u/Riyonak:
    ```
    Seems likely. Have a bunch of deaths in the last chapter or so without saying anything for the sake of drama and reader tension. Then it reveals that Zorian is actually Aizen all along and it is just an illusion to trick the contract.
    ```

    - u/Caliburn0:
      ```
      Ah... I love how you described that. Yes. Zorian would make an excellent Aizen. After all of this is over, we need to have a sequel where Zorian dramatically betrays everybody without killing anyone important for no discernible reason. Then trounces everyone in one to one combat while having highly specialised plans for everything he can't tackle personally. Still without killing anyone important. He'll bring the government to its knees, only to be stopped by an insanely overpowered Kirielle trained by Zach and the Angels.

          Gods though (even if Angels and gods were both originally on the "divine" plane)

          May not exactly be in a "timeloop," but I think the plot point about the gods disappearing may still be addressed one last time.

              ```
              There's a theory that since the time loop somehow prevented the Angels and Demons from appearing, that the lack of Gods is also caused by another time loop with a greater scope.

    >is to trick Zach into thinking everyone who knows about the loop is dead, right?

    I'm not so sure about that. It's most probable, because Zach is the easiest to fool. His incapability in soul magic and relatively low competency in mind magic made elaborate illusion worthwhile to pull. But nobody said it would be used as momentary distraction. Zorian love distraction. Remember the soul severing disc, both as small projectiles and platform that activates on notice? Both are just distraction for full blast dispelling wave and do-or-die mind incursion against Quatach Ichl.
    ```

  - u/-Fender-:
    ```
    Zach doesn't have soul sight. They fully expected that trying to make him activate it would trigger a restart, so they didn't bother. If a controller wants soul sight, he needs the Ring, which they will probably leave in Sulrothum hands.
    ```

    - u/pleasedothenerdful:
      ```
      I think the ring only works that way in the loop anyway.
      ```

      - u/-Fender-:
        ```
        No. The Ring's time loop effect is to place a marker on someone that allows you to track them. The soul sight is its normal effect.
        ```

  - u/LLJKCicero:
    ```
    I don't fully get how this is supposed to work. Is the idea that the geas will 'expire' and so Zorian only has to keep up the illusion for a little while?
    ```

    - u/I-want-pulao:
      ```
      Yeah, if the deadline hits and Zach thinks everyone has died, then he has technically filled the contract, IE Zach doesn't have to die. Once that danger is past, the illusion collapses and everyone is safe and well (except Jornak and Silverlake who have hopefully died by then)
      ```

      - u/TheBobulus:
        ```
        I still say the Black Room is going to come into play in some way. The angel was very specific in mentioning that they didn't have any influence inside it, so it's an extra level of protection in case any bits of the Contract are divinely-triggered.
        ```

        - u/I-want-pulao:
          ```
          Yeah, true. The only quibble I have is that they'd have to set up the black room right before the end of the month, which is right before the final battle, which is also something the angel was very specific about. And I'm guessing they would also need Zach to fight in the battle..
          ```

      - u/Serious_Feedback:
        ```
        > (except Jornak and Silverlake who have hopefully died by then)

        Could they also be illusion'd out of their teas?
        ```

        - u/I-want-pulao:
          ```
          Key question - is the contract only checked/verified at the end of the month and never more? Because then they have to trick themselves just for that one particular moment/day. 

          Honestly, I'm not sure. The geas on Zach's soul is to kill or otherwise deal with anyone who performs mind magic. The geas is also to kill himself/die if there is anyone who knows about the timeloop still alive. The geas on the other two is that they free the primordial, or they die at the end of the month. But who does the checking? In Zach's case, it's his perception. In RR and SL's case, we dunno. SL actually literally says that she wiped her mind of the contract however she can still feel it in her soul. 

          The angels did say one thing interesting though - they said that they (the angels) are not the primordials and (I guess contrary to the primordials) the angels are not powerless on the material planes. So the primordials can't affect things in the material world, ergo the contract Pan has with RR and SL needs to have a self checking geas, cuz the primordial can't make any on the fly decisions. It's a simple algorithm.

          &#x200B;

          All this to say that I'm not sure, but if the checking mechanism is their perception, then it's theoretically possible. however, both RR and SL are incredibly suspicious and paranoid so I don't think they would ever trust anyone to take over their minds and illusion them out. 

          &#x200B;

          I was thinking that QI is being a little to cavalier in general though.

          He's a frickin' Lich.  He's playing the long, long, long game, because he has practical near-immortality.

          A primordial being unleashed and with angels coming out is an extinction-level event that could directly impact him.

          QI spending another hundred years subverting the governments of the continent to set the stage for his plans seems a small price to pay to avoid primordial play-time fallout.

          I dunno.  Perhaps I am down several orders of magnitude in the ruthlessness department to accurately model a Lich's value system...

          To really cement the idea that trying to fight the dragons is a lot of work. They were already considering how to handle three dragon mages, being told there was 30 suddenly made everyone give up trying - which was the point.

          An idea you want to keep in hand would be something that could be countered and acts like a counter itself. For example having a double agent would be something you wouldn't reveal, but 30 dragons is a lot harder to keep secret and worth just as much revealing as keeping secret.

          They've definitely got more cards up their sleeves for sure though, but the info they revealed works just as well used like it was than kept as a card to play later.

  Spear of resolve becoming human for a day would be quite funny since walking/speaking are acquired abilities, thus not granted by the potion. Her experience with using mind magic on people also would not help since it should be using the victims experience.

    Nope. It's still possible that Jornak was false flag.

    Even if he's not, it was out of character for Zorian to provide another valid "face" to a known competent-shapeshifter.

  Yeeees, do it Quatach Ichl, join them, strike Jornak down with all of your hatred. For reals though, it seems like Quatach Ichl is quite confident, but I'm hoping he'll end up helping Zorian vs Jornak at some point, maybe a nice dragon Quatach Ichl showdown whilst the other fight is happening.

  Did anybody notice a drop in the quality of the prose? I noticed a lot more stilted and awkward phrasing in this chapter than normal.
  ```

  - u/GlueBoy:
    ```
    Nobody103 is Croatian, English is his 2nd or 3rd language, he probably has to go through many drafts for it to come out passable. I think that's the main reason the chapters take so long. Very impressive, considering.
    ```

    - u/D0nkeyHS:
      ```
      Yeah, so? It can be impressive and there can be a drop. The two aren't exclusive.
      ```

      - u/Gr_Cheese:
        ```
        I don't think there was a drop in quality so much as this was literally the most dialogue dense chapter of the series, and the monotone voice of the characters in the other chapters is easier to forgive / ignore when it's interspersed with the MC's diary-like thoughts.

        tl;dr The dialogue was always meh.
        ```

        - u/D0nkeyHS:
          ```
          Sure I guess, but why is this a reply to me? Why not to the comment that says that there was a drop? 

          I wasn't arguing that there was a drop but rather that English not being the authors mother tongue isn't really relevant when it comes to whether there was a drop.
          ```

          - u/Gr_Cheese:
            ```
            Because you acknowledged the possibility of a drop, when there was no drop. Semantic arguments do not get a free pass, you chose a side.

            And why not reply to you? Hi.
            ```

            - u/D0nkeyHS:
              ```
              So, going by that, you've chosen a side on whether t it being impressive excludes there being a drop and you've chosen that it does exclude there being a drop? That's a ridiculous thing, why would it exclude there being a drop? A person can have lapses in their writing whether or not they are writing in their mother tongue, or in their second/third/etc language.




              If I've chosen a side on whether there was a drop you've chosen that side on that.




              I chose no side. I said one thing doesn't exclude another. That is not choosing a side. I can say that, and talk about that without choosing a side on either thing. Us vs them mentality is a plague in today's world. Saying I've chosen a side is detrimental bullshit.




              What you said is irrelevant to what I said, that is why not reply to me.
              ```

              - u/Gr_Cheese:
                ```
                > that is why not reply to me.

                I don't know about that. I would argue that I did, in fact, reply to you.

                Hi.
                ```

                  So you're gonna take one part of 1 sentence, twist its meaning, reply to that and ignore the rest of my comment?

                  This is /r/rational. Validity of thought is supposed to matter. Correcting something is not choosing a side. I'll correct arguments that were in favor of something I agree with! Bad arguments are bad arguments, irrationality is irrationality, no matter what "side" they are on. 

                  Don't be what's wrong in today's world, don't spread an us vs then mentality. Don't be /r/irrational.

                  If the guy I replied to said that the number in nobody's username didn't drop and I said "Yeah, so what? That doesn't mean there wasn't a drop in quality" you'd behave as though I chose a side? WTF? If not then why do it now?

    ```
    No. It's another attempt to reveal multiple 'facts' through verbal communication alone. The first attempt was right after Silverlake betrayal, inside the time loop. I'd say it's an improvement, but still not quite passable. For the first part of the chapter, quality is low, but not lower than previous attempt.

        I feel both Zorian's small talk with Quatach Ichl and his date with Spear of Resolve are up to par. Plots (Quatach Ichl reluctance to stay back and Zorian mind wipe strategy) developed smoothly there. Inclusion of Novelty, on the other hand, felt forcefully attached. I actually surprised people hyped about it.

          I feel like the ending of each chapter of MoL usually has to have some sort of revelation, twist, or otherwise cliffhanger. Novelty might have been forcefully attached to adhere to this trend.
