  Holy shit. 

  You're going to run out of well established canon characters pretty soon at this pace.

  You don't pull punches on Character Death, I can say that much.

  Cussing in front of children is not okay.  Children watching fight potentially to the death is.  The first read through I thought it was just some comic relief, but as I considered it something else occurred to me.  Was this an intentional move to highlight the values dissonance?  If so, well played author.

  Edit* no wait it was glancing through the comment section that made me realize this.

  Holy Roman Colosseum, Batman. 

  Everything I hear about this crapsack world makes it even more so. The emphasized lethality among children, combined with the major spectator event of the tournament...

  Yeah.

  So... blowback. Tournament or not I can't imagine the Hyuga will take Hinata killing Neji lightly, especially seeing as how she's now technically not a Hyuga herself at all. I mean it might be unseemly for them to seek to revenge themselves against another Leaf ninja, and somewhat undignified to do so over the death of a Branch family member, but no more unseemly than Hinata killing another Leaf ninja in the tournament to begin with.

  I suppose, however, that this might be causing some within the Hyuga to rethink the dismissal of Hinata as heir to the clan, able to beat their shining star Neji so simply, and showing the ruthlessness that she was believed to be lacking previously. I'm sure Hiashi has opponents within the clan who would love to rub his face in such a mistake as choosing the wrong successor.

  That said, given that Hinata asserted herself by killing a Branch family member, the rest of the Branch family would almost certainly resent her being accepted back into the fold as a result. Such a splinter faction that would endorse Hinata being restored would have to come from within the main family, and the fact that she's been disowned would make that a bridge too far, I expect, especially given the reason she was disowned. If Naruto could reveal his lineage, and Hinata and her supporters could frame the Byakugan transplant as sealing ties between the Hyuga and the Leaf's jinchuriki who is also a strong candidate to become Hokage someday, then they might be willing to overlook that, but failing that I can't see any sort of internal Hyuga uprising in opposition to Hiashi in support of Hinata.

  I expect we might be seeing the Hyuga taking the excuse Hinata mentioned earlier, refusing the revenge by citing the waiver, but that feels kind of... unfinished. If not just for revenge purposes, surely some will interpret this as Hinata threatening the Hyuga and will want to act on that basis.

  Really, I think I'm just trying to come up with some scenario where Hinata isn't found as the victim of another perfect Hyuga assassination, but the outlook isn't great.

  I mean, really, why go so far as to kill Neji? Defeating him without killing him, forcing him to yield would have gotten the point of her being better than she had been judged to be across, perhaps even more strongly than killing him. Protecting Naruto from Neji? I don't think Naruto's in less danger from the Hyuga than he was before - Neji's determination to kill them is certainly shared by some of the Hyuga and now likely exacerbated by this.

  The explanation that feels most right is just that Hinata wanted to feel the exercise of power, to feel that she really did have the strength to fight back against the clan that had controlled, humiliated, and abused her, and to fight back in a definitive, absolute way. Which just seems, understandable, but stupider than I've come to expect characters in this story to be, but then, so was Sasuke planning to wander into the woods and shoot up on some special magic Uchiha power juice a foreign ninja had given him.

    ```
    Quick note on the battle mechanics: chakra limitations meant that if she dropped shield layers to let Neji yield she mightn’t have still been able to raise enough to win, anymore, and thus Neji might no longer have felt the need to surrender as soon as he was allowed the freedom to actually do so. Parfit’s hitchhiker strikes again.
    ```

- u/Shadawn:
  ```
  Why didn't Neji use Kaiten (Heavenly Spin) there? In my opinion, it would destroy Kekkai really easy.

  Also, looking at Neji-Kidoumaru fight, Neji could probably just slice Kekkai with his fingers.

  EDIT: Also, constricting strenght of barriers stacks pretty strange. At least it's not additive, otherwise if 1 barrier could be stopped by leaning on him, 10 barriers can't constrict a human to death.
  ```

  - u/Jace_MacLeod:
    ```
    He might not have had enough space to perform it. Also, it's quite possible that Kaiten's protective properties come from it's rapid spinning, not from any significant outward force. Unable to break the barrier, and compressed beyond normal use, it might have just created a nicely blended Neji smoothie.
    ```

- u/SometimesATroll:
  ```
  I commented on the mood whiplash before, and the mood whiplash hasn't changed.  However; I find I'm starting to really like the rapid shifts.  It's been keeping me on my toes more than what I normally read.

  So forget what I said before, this is great.

  That was nasty. [Beware The Nice One](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheNiceOnes), indeed. Nice to see Hinata win this -- the only two times I've seen her get a flat-out victory in fanfic are this one and one time when she activated Neji's Caged Bird seal. 

  On a side note, I've been a little worried about you putting actual numbers on chakra use. I'm afraid it's going to video-gameify the story too much. So far, though, it seems to be playing out pretty well. I do find myself wondering why Naruto chose to use "millichakra" as his base unit, instead of sticking to integers.
