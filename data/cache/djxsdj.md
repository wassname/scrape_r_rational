  TFW you're fried after a long day and are trying to unwind and get called back into work to deal with a crisis...

  Also TFW you've been away from Earth for a while and finally make it back and things have *changed*...

    Being a bad speedster before and after Flicker. . . Yeah that's a big change.

    Heh Flicker is the singelton Speedster. She's not the singelton AI because she sought out two possible singeltons as her mentors and her Father has lessons learned about not becoming one.

      Indeed, I call her the ultimate Speedster and she ruined me for other supers that are less awesome.

  Really great to see how Flicker deals with an opponent speedster. And wow, that last paragraph. Friggin hilarious.

  Is Maker's Ark on hiatus? I keep rereading the series up to the current MA chapter, getting frustrated that there is no more slake my curiosity, swearing I'm going to wait until MA is finished to read any more so I can just binge it all at once, waiting a few months, getting impatient, and starting it all over again.

    It is temporarily on hold while I work out what to do with an Earthside subplot that would be interpreted very differently today than when I planned it.  I have adopted a strategy used by a number of other writers of working on multiple projects, so if I get stuck on one I can keep writing and get my flow back.  If it helps, this story takes place at the same time as the very end of Journeyman's flashback narrative in Chapter 45 of Maker's Ark, which will be relevant soon. (That's why he's gone)
    ```

      ```
      See, now I'm curious about the context of that subplot that would be interpreted wrong. Theoretically a good thought provoking allegory could transcend current events? (But I get why that isn't always the case in real life.)

  ```
  Is the fall of Doc Future story finished or can I just start reading this?
  ```

  - u/DocFuture:
    ```
    "Princess" is a prequel, so there shouldn't be plot spoilers for Fall.  The serials "The Fall of Doc Future" and "Skybreaker's Call" are complete novels with appropriate endings.  "The Maker's Ark" is a sequel that is not yet complete.  The stand alone stories on my "Stories" page that do not specifically refer to the Maker's Ark also give closure.
