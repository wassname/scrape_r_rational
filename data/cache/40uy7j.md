## [Challenge Companion] Immortality

### Post:

Have you read Nick Bostrom's [Fable of the Dragon Tyrant](http://www.nickbostrom.com/fable/dragon.html)? If not, that's probably a better use of your time than reading whatever it is that I have to say.

[TVTropes has a good overview](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Immortality) of the ways that immortality is used in fiction. I've heard people say that immortality is usually shunned because of sour grapes or simply Deathism, but I'm not actually sure that this is true. Writers like drama and immortality removes a key aspect of that drama, unless you're using immortality in order to generate drama, in which case you're almost certainly portraying it in a somewhat negative light. It's the same reason that I think you see utopias a lot less than dystopias. It's easier to find conflict if there are tensions to exploit, which means that a story where everyone is immortal and everyone is okay with that is one that doesn't immediately serve the writerly purpose. So writers are obliged to make immortality into something that generates conflict, usually by attaching a high price to it.

Of course, some writers have more principled arguments against immortality, just as some people legitimately believe that immortality is bad. I think that would be an interesting position to steelman.

Anyway, this is the companion thread to the weekly challenge. If you have any questions, comments, or related (ideally rational) stories about immortality, please leave them below.

  Writing about Immortality is hard because, when you include it, the incentives which drive human society just... dissolve. It's like including someone truly omniscient, where the sheer power of the ability distorts the fabric of text-time around it. To have immortality requires some method of balancing its presence, with a flaw (like Vampirism) or a counter-force (Werewolves), or something else.

  And, in the end, immortality doesn't even add all that much to the story, because the reader can't hang around all that long, even if they wanted to. I'm sure we'll get literary advances in this area as life expectancies rise and rise, but not until then.

    I've got to disagree.

    The "incentives which drive human society" are *always* imaginary. Turning the minutia of our everyday lives into life-or-death struggles is an intellectual exercise as much as it's an evolutionary throwback or a hormonal impulse.

    Fear of death is the *cheapest* fear. What about humiliation? Imagine knowing that all of your immortal friends will remember that stupid thing you did *forever*. What if that thing was hurtful instead, and you fear being shunned? Telling yourself that "nobody will care in 100 years" isn't going to feel significantly better than telling your mortal self the same thing. You'll have to experience the misery and loneliness of the next few weeks just the same.

    Yes, immortality makes threatening the life of your protagonist impossible. There are other threats.

  Rather than immortality as prolonging life, is it alright if I write about a world with souls and resurrection magic? I know we're all in the camp of longing for real life not-dying-of-age-and-illness, but in fiction I'm much more interested in mapping out what souls and magic have to offer.

    Sure, write to your heart's content. Resurrection is a form of immortality, after all.

  "It is logically true by induction that you are either suicidal or want to be immortal" is probably my favorite thing I got out of HPMOR.

  Perhaps I should weigh in with a piece about an alien civilization of (for *really* complicated reasons) human-like minds in immortal, needless bodies.

  I.e. human-like psyche vs. immortality and no physical needs, on a civilizational scale.
