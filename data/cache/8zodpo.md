  #**Rationality On A Scale**


  Compiled by /u/oliwhail from posts by /u/Noumero, /u/Sailor_Vulcan, /u/ArisKatsaris, /u/SimoneNonvelodico, and /u/turtleswamp

  ---

  ‘Rationality’ is a specific quality of fictional works - it does not simply mean ‘good’, nor is all good writing necessarily rational.

  A work of fiction is rational to the extent that it focuses on competent characters with consistent motivations proactively pursuing their goals in settings whose premises are rigorously thought-out and consistently applied.

  In particular, characters in rational fiction  often follow unorthodox or genre-defying courses of action which require clever planning, careful analysis, and the creative application of resources or knowledge. 

  Settings in rational fiction may or may not include fantastical elements, so long as the consequences of their underlying rules are carefully considered and taken seriously in crafting the story’s world.

  **Common Elements**

  Though the presence of any particular feature below is not a requirement, the following characteristics and tropes appear often enough in rational fiction to help point to the cluster.

  - Careful Worldbuilding: The "rules" a setting runs on remain consistent, as do their effects and implications. In preexisting settings (e.g. fanfiction), the author may seek to remove or justify incongruities, or to explore their implications.
  - Fair-Play Whodunnit: A story's mysteries or problems could, in theory, be solved by attentive readers ahead of time, and the reader should be able to see at least in retrospect how the characters came up with their ideas.
  - Munchkinry: Characters strive to exploit their world's rules and solve their problems by leveraging their available resources in creative ways.
  - Cerebral Values: The story demonstrates the usefulness of deliberation, preparation, deduction, etc.
  - Aspiring Rationalism: The story focuses on revealing characters' thinking, motives, decision-making, and/or their attempts to improve their reasoning abilities. This is often a particular feature of the rationalist fiction subgenre of rational fiction, particularly if the reader is meant to be able to take practical lessons from the work.
  ```

    > Left-Brained Values: A respect for themes such as intelligence, reason, and forethought.

    I strongly dislike the use of 'Left-Brained' in this statement. It implies an overly simplistic model of the brain, which is scientifically inaccurate (see e.g. [here](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0071275)) and thus unnecessarily detracts from the very point the definition is making.

    Additionally, for some people (me, for example) it does not carry meaning by itself, as I would not have been able to tell you the difference between 'left-brained' and 'right-brained' values had you asked me an hour ago.
    ```

    - u/oliwhail:

      I know it’s inaccurate, but chose to use it to appeal to (what I thought was?) the common understanding.

        >I know it’s inaccurate, but chose to use it to appeal to (what I thought was?) the common understanding.

        That's not wrong rethorically, but I think our shared public-facing definition needs to be held to a higher standard than that. Referring to a concept that's pseudoscientific - or at least oversimplified to the point where it carries similar connotations - might be taken seriously by a portion of readers, which doesn't look good for us.

    Very good, I like it. Minor suggestions/nitpicks:

    * The first sentence is pretty complex/long, if apt. Could it be divided in two, perhaps?

    * The term "agent" from the first sentence could be misunderstood by unenlightened people. Could it be substituted? 

    * Reformatting. I don't think the definition itself should be written in large letters, or formatted as a quote. (Also, a nitpick among nitpicks: the template calls for the header and the definition itself to be divided by a line.)

    * Rewording. I think it looks better if all entries on a list follow a common pattern. The first two entries on your list read a bit differently from the rest. Something like [Name]:[Description] would be ideal.
    ```

    - u/oliwhail:

        Yes, that seems better. By the way, what do you think about [this point](https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8xqtp0/meta_rrational_characteristics_of_rational/e2h3ntn/) by u/Silver_Swift?:

        >I think it might be better to think of rational fiction as a qualifier that attaches to other genres, rather than as a genre on its own. You can write rational fiction in just about every genre you feel like, but you can't write just rational fiction. Rational Fantasy and Rational Sci-Fi are the most common combinations and I can easily imagine rational westerns, rational animes, rational horror, rational mysteries and even rational romance stories, but I come up short trying to imagine a rational story that isn't also part of some other genre.

        The way you framed your definition seems most compatible with this point, out of all proposals so far. What do you think about explicitly incorporating it?

        ^(~~*Actually, you should go back to write the next update of Marked for Death. I need more data to plot our party's awesome doom.*~~)

          > The way you framed your definition seems most compatible with this point

          Indeed! That was definitely the intention - I liked the discussion of rationality as a scale rather than a classification that I saw in last week's discussions.

          I'm certainly open to incorporating the definition more explicitly - have any thoughts on how that might be done in an elegant way?
          ```

            I adapted my definition to reflect the "rationality-is-a-quality" point better, and this is how I did it:

            >"Rationality" is a specific quality of fictional works, applicable to all of them regardless of genres and settings.

            What do you think? (I also took major inspiration from your definition; I hope you don't mind.)

            - u/oliwhail:

              Not at all!

              > What do you think?

              I feel “applicable to all of them” is slightly vague - the idea is that you could in principle *evaluate* any given work’s level of rationality, right?
              ```

              - u/Noumero:
                ```
                I see. What about this?:

                In case of your definition, <...> = "focuses on competent characters with consistent motivations proactively pursuing their goals in settings whose premises are rigorously thought-out and consistently applied".

        It requires way too much working memory to process.

        > A fictional work’s level of ‘rationality' describes the extent to which that work focuses on exploring what happens when consistently-modeled characters pursue their goals in settings whose premises, however fantastical, are rigorously and consistently applied.

        Here's a suggestion for a re-write:

        > A fictional work's 'rationality' can be measured on a scale; fiction on the 'rational' end of this scale explores what happens when characters with consistent motivations pursue their goals in settings with consistent premises. These settings may or may not be fantastical in nature, as long as the underlying rules are internally consistent.

        I think it's (nearly) semantically equivalent while easier (for me) to understand.
        ```

        - u/oliwhail:
          ```
          I think I see what you're getting at. Let me know what you think:

          > A work of fictional ‘rational' to the extent that it focuses on exploring what happens when characters with consistent motivations proactively pursue their goals in settings whose premises are rigorously and consistently applied. These settings may or may not be fantastical in nature, as long as the underlying rules and their implications are taken seriously. As a result, characters in rational fiction often follow courses of action which violate genre conventions and which frequently require deliberation, preparation, and the application of resources or knowledge in creative and clever ways.

  - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
    ```
    Thanks for the heads up - just a small thing. Personally I like the idea of mentioning the concept of a story "needing" or not rationality, as I did in my original post in the previous thread. Even if worded differently, the main concept that I think would be important to express is that rational =/= good, and most importantly, non rational =/= bad. I know most people get this anyway, but I've seen criticism of r/rational that makes me inclined to think perhaps some people on first glance misunderstand this. Do you think this could be worked in? Any other opinion on this?
    ```

    - u/oliwhail:
      ```
      Hmmm. So, I like what this is driving at - I've seen those same criticisms, and they're really frustrating. I'll definitely give some thought to how the idea could be integrated, though I'm having some trouble thinking of how to do it smoothly and would love suggestions :)
      ```

      - u/oliwhail:
        ```
        /u/SimoneNonvelodico I added a line emphasizing the distinction between rational and good - how well does that fit what you were going for?

        - u/ketura:
          ```
          As another data point, I personally think that line adds nothing good to the overall strength of the definition. *Obviously* the people who subscribe to a given subreddit are after the content posted to that subreddit; spelling this out is a bit redundant.

          I would remove that paragraph and work the sentiment into the first. Something like adding a line like: "This focus on rigor is orthogonal to the quality of the work itself, but produces a unique and desirable flavor all its own."
          ```

          - u/oliwhail:
            ```
            While I’m sympathetic to the sentiment, I’m not sure a less explicit message will be clear enough to the type of folks who want to make fun of rational fiction?

              Do we care about them? The sidebar is for the ~10k of us here and those whose tastes line up with ours. We didn't start this rewrite process because trolls were making fun of us, we started it because we ourselves who are served by it felt it was insufficient.

  ###Agenty Characters On A Scale Plus Tropes

  **Originally authored by /u/Noumero; includes ideas by /u/haiku_fornification, /u/Silver_Swift, /u/oliwhail.**

  ___

  "Rationality" is a specific quality of any fictional work, independent of genres and settings. It describes the extent to which the work explores thoughtful behaviour of people [in honest pursuit of their goals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounded_rationality), as well as consequences of their behaviour on the fictional world or the story's plot. In highly-rational fiction, realistic intellectual agency is put above established literary tropes, and all other aspects of the narrative.

  Highly-rational fiction could include one or more of the following features:

  * Focus on intelligent characters solving problems through creative applications of their knowledge and resources.

  * Examination of goals and motives: the story makes reasons behind characters' decisions clear.

  * Intellectual pay-off: the story's climax features a satisfying intelligent solution to its problems.

  * Aspiring rationalism: the story heavily focuses on characters' thinking, or their attempts to improve their reasoning abilities. This is a feature of **rationalist fiction**, a subcategory of rational fiction.

  * Thoughtful worldbuilding: the fictional world follows known, consistent rules, as a consequence of rational background characters exploring it or building realistic social structures.

  Presence of these *particular* features is not necessary: overall impression of the work is more important.

  **Adjacent tropes:** Rational stories tend to include certain narrative elements. Though their presence *doesn't* make a story more rational, this community highly enjoys them. Most important ones include:

  * [Fair-Play Whodunnit](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairPlayWhodunnit): story's mysteries could be solved by attentive readers ahead of time.

  * Absence of [Deus Ex Machina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deus_ex_machina): established story rules are never broken.

  * [Deconstruction](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction): genre tropes are re-imagined in a more realistic manner.

  * Munchkinry: characters attempt to exploit their world's rules in creative, non-intuitive ways.

  * [Genre Savviness](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy): characters are familiar with common genre tropes and try to avoid or exploit them.
  ```

  - u/LieGroupE8:
    ```
    I like the listing of bullet points and tropes after the main definition. This helps clarify the definition, and I think it should be part of whichever solution is chosen. However, I think the main definition is still too general here.

    > Rational fiction is written with intent to explore thoughtful, goal-driven behaviour of people in reaction to their world

    I can just imagine writers unfamiliar with the rationalist community seeing this definition and saying to themselves, "Well, yes, I should hope that my characters are thoughtful and goal-driven! That's just good writing advice." I'm not sure that this definition alone adequately conveys the idea that rationalist fiction specifically goes beyond other kinds of fiction in its focus on this aspect of the story.

    > Rational characters always strive .... their decision-making is never warped ....

    "Always" and "never" are strong words... I'm sure exceptions could be cooked up easily.

    This definition also makes rational characters a core feature of the genre, excluding works that might explore consistent worlds in other ways besides having such characters. That's not *necessarily* bad; the community needs to decide whether it wants rational characters to be a necessary condition for the genre, or just a common sufficient condition.
    ```

    - u/Noumero:
      ```

      #

      >"Always" and "never" are strong words... I'm sure exceptions could be cooked up easily.

      Good points. Reworded that section. Better now?

      (However, I *do* think rational fiction is just fiction-which-must-be-good-in-certain-ways, not really a "genre". Yes, all perfectly-good fiction would be rational. It doesn't mean that *all* commonly-accepted good fiction is rational, or that all rational fiction is good. It means rational fiction is always good in one particular way.)

      >This definition also makes rational characters a core feature of the genre, excluding works that might explore consistent worlds in other ways besides having such characters

      Well, sort of. As a possible counter-example, consider Arthur Clark's [*Rendezvous with Rama*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rendezvous_with_Rama). It's about a crew of astronauts exploring an alien starship. It doesn't, as far as I remember, focus on their thinking process and reasoning; however, the starship is explored in-depth. It could qualify as rational fiction, however, since the ship is a creation of alien background characters. If their engineering decisions were sensible → the worldbuilding is consistent, then that part of the work is rational.

      There's two types of debatably-rational works which my definition excludes: about irrational characters living in a natural, consistently-written world, and textbooks about fictional natural worlds with no characters at all. I don't think it's a major problem, but my mind could be changed.
      ```

      - u/LieGroupE8:
        ```
        The rewording is better, yes.

        > However, I do think rational fiction is just fiction-which-must-be-good-in-certain-ways, not really a "genre"

        I think of it more as a nebulous genre whose defining features correlate strongly with some good writing advice.

        > Yes, all perfectly-good fiction would be rational

        I disagree. Different genres aspire to different things. For example, a perfectly good comedy is not likely to be rational in any sense.

        > It could qualify as rational fiction, however, since the ship is a creation of alien background characters

        This seems like a huge stretch of your definition.

        > There's two types of debatably-rational works which my definition excludes...  I don't think it's a major problem

        It's not a *major* problem, at least right now, but personally I would allow room in the definition for other kinds of works. I think it's up to the community to vote on this. (I will post my own write-up eventually).
        ```

        - u/Noumero:
          ```
          >a perfectly good comedy is not likely to be rational in any sense

          So, a perfectly-good comedy could have inconsistent characterization?.. Hm, alright, granted. There's no objective standard for "good fiction", let alone "perfectly good fiction". My point was that all short summaries of what rational fiction is *would* sound like good writing advice, because rational fiction is built around treating certain pieces of good writing advice as core concepts.

          >This seems like a huge stretch of your definition.

          I don't think so. Brief digression: In practice, when reading rational fiction discussions, I frequently saw questions along the lines of "Why didn't character X do Y?", "Why didn't population F take over the world, if they could A, B, and C?", or "Why was M set up this way?". A Perfectly Rational Story, according to the intent behind my definition, would be such that answers to all of these questions about it exist and are followable. Questions about aliens' engineering decisions definitely fall under this as well.

          However, what's important is that it *does* seem like a stretch to you. It's not supposed to; the aforementioned idea should be made clear. Do you have any suggestions on how to achieve this?

          >I think of it more as a nebulous genre whose defining features correlate strongly with some good writing advice.

          That's an interesting point, actually. I found [this comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8xqtp0/meta_rrational_characteristics_of_rational/e2h3ntn/) by u/Silver_Swift particularly insightful:

          >I think it might be better to think of rational fiction as a qualifier that attaches to other genres, rather than as a genre on its own. You can write rational fiction in just about every genre you feel like, but you can't write just rational fiction. Rational Fantasy and Rational Sci-Fi are the most common combinations and I can easily imagine rational westerns, rational animes, rational horror, rational mysteries and even rational romance stories, but I come up short trying to imagine a rational story that isn't also part of some other genre.

          - u/LieGroupE8:
            ```
            > So, a perfectly-good comedy could have inconsistent characterization?

            What I meant was that it would have irrational / non-agenty characters and weird, improbable plots.

            > what's important is that it does seem like a stretch to you

            It seems like a stretch to me because your definition says that a rational work should focus on thoughtful characters with agency. I don't automatically consider the aliens in Rendezvous with Rama to be "characters"; they are part of the setting, at least the way my brain parses these categories. That's why I would suggest having some mention of consistent settings in the definition.

            > >  I come up short trying to imagine a rational story that isn't also part of some other genre.

            Hmmm, I suppose I do too. "Rational" is a genre-modifier like italics are a text-modifier.

              Reworded again, explicitly stated that it applies to protagonists as well as background people.

              Downside: I think it's getting a bit convoluted up there. Three sentences, four references to "characters" or "people". I'll need to simplify it somehow.

              >Hmmm, I suppose I do too. "Rational" is a genre-modifier like italics are a text-modifier.

              Well. Great.

            That sounds like a non-sequitur. You don't treat "consistent characterization" as your sole defining characteristic of rational fiction, so why do you think that when someone talks about a non-rational story, they mean one with inconsistent characterization?

            What would a 'rational' version of a surreal comedy like 'Airplane!' look like? Or of Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy? Do you think those would be improved by making them fit more into the rational genre?

  #Psychosocial Realism Given the Premise
  #Originally authored by /u/Sailor_Vulcan.

  Rational fiction is fiction that is psychologically and socially realistic given the premise. In other words, characters, organizations and societies in works of rational fiction think and act in ways that are plausible given the rules of the setting.

  This doesn't mean the setting itself has to be 100% realistic overall. Works of rational fiction can contain many fantastical elements, as long as their in-universe characters, organizations and societies think and act in ways that are plausible in such a setting.

  This means that highly intelligent and sane characters must also think and act in ways that are plausible given the rules of the setting. So when highly intelligent and sane characters are portrayed in a work of rational fiction their intelligence and sanity is portrayed realistically. However, a work need not include highly intelligent and sane characters to be considered rational fiction.
  ```

  - u/Sailor_Vulcan:
    ```
    Commentary:

    No need to invent overly complicated lists of criteria. All rational fiction has one common denominator, one characteristic that every single work that has ever been referred to as rational fiction has: Psychological and social realism given the rules of the setting. In other words, characters think and act the way they would think and act if they and the world they reside in actually existed.

    Notice this is not the same thing as being 100% realistic. You can have as many fantastical elements as you like as long as individual characters, organizations and societies think and act in ways that are plausible given the setting. For instance, in HPMOR, Harry's magical dark side isn't psychologically realistic in a real life setting, but it is psychologically realistic in a world where HPMOR-style level-1 horcruxes exist.

    Any work that someone would call rational fiction, this definition applies to. Even Unsong falls under this definition (How would people and society really think and act if Hebrew scripture was actually true). Same thing with Harry Potter and the Natural 20 (how would individuals and societies in the Harry Potter universe really think and act in response to a first contact scenario with an alien "human" from a Universe that runs on rules as written Dungeons and Dragons).

    Notice that psychological realism also applies to intelligent characters, so intelligence would have to be portrayed realistically.

    I am quite confident in this definition. It is the only definition that includes every work that has ever been referred to as rational fiction, and if everyone votes for something else, then everyone else is wrong.

      > Any work that someone would call rational fiction, this definition applies to

      That doesn't necessarily make it a good definition -- it could be too general. In my view, it applies to too much fiction, not all of which will be liked by /r/rational. It seems more like a property of good writing, which is the problem with the current definition. I can't think of a fic I've read that this definition *doesn't* apply to.
      ```

  - u/Noumero:
    ```
    I think it runs into the very same problem that our current definition has, namely that it's too general. "Self-consistent world" just seems like a property of good fiction, and I don't think modifying it to mean "self-consistent psychosocial aspect of the world" restricts it sufficiently well. Using this definition, it would be quite hard to distinguish sufficiently well-written non-rational fiction from sufficiently well-written rational fiction.

    Additionally, even if it's a sound definition of "rational fiction" in abstract, it doesn't capture our interests as a community. For example, we enjoy competent protagonists, in-depth exploration of consistent fictional worlds, "solvable" stories, and stories employing real rationality techniques, but this definition doesn't select for them at all.

    I think it's *too* simple.
    ```

    - u/Sailor_Vulcan:
      ```
      I disagree. Any definition more specific than that would exclude a lot of works that a lot of people agree are examples of rational fiction. Also, judging by how much people here liked Unsong and Worm, I don't think that the community agrees with you about it not cappturing their interests. Case in point, name me ONE well-written example of something that fits the above definition which this community wouldn't like or wouldn't consider rational fic.Also, this:

      \> competent protagonists, in-depth exploration of consistent fictional worlds, "solvable" stories, and stories employing real rationality techniques

      is merely a consequence of depicting intelligence and sanity realistically. Depictions of intelligence and sanity having to be realistic is implied by my definition, and saying that my definition doesn't select for them \*at all\* is simply untrue.  
      Also there are plenty of well-written works that aren't rational fiction which don't fit this definition, such as Homestuck.
      ```

      - u/Noumero:
        ```
        >Any definition more specific than that would exclude a lot of works that a lot of people agree are examples of rational fiction

        For example? What kinds of works would they exclude?

        >name me ONE well-written example of something that fits the above definition which this community wouldn't like or wouldn't consider rational fic

        I'll name an entire swathe of literature: [Literary fiction.](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/588dwl/d_literary_fiction_cant_be_this_depressing/) It's set in our world, so you know it's consistent, and it has realistic characters, they're just boring and/or deplorable and/or reactive.

        >> competent protagonists, in-depth exploration of consistent fictional worlds, "solvable" stories, and stories employing real rationality techniques

        >is merely a consequence of depicting intelligence and sanity realistically. Depictions of intelligence and sanity having to be realistic is implied by my definition, and saying that my definition doesn't select for them \*at all\* is simply untrue.

        Realistic depiction of intelligence and rationality do not imply that main characters must be intelligent or rational. They could be realistically portrayed fools, and it would fit.

        In-depth exploration of the world and "solvability" of the story have nothing to do with psychosocial internal consistency. They're properties of the *narrative*, of the way authors choose to tell their story, not properties of the fictional world.

  #Author Intent
  #Originally authored by /u/ArisKatsaris.

  ----

  **In rational fiction:**

  - The author displays respect for the value of intelligence, reason, forethought, and preparation.
  - The author seeks to explore the moral and material implications of the elements in the story, as well as alternate solutions to presented problems, even if they violate the usual conventions of the genre.

  Pursuant to the above, rational fiction **usually contains**:

  - Consistent worldbuilding. In pre-established settings (like fanfiction) the author makes an effort to remove or justify seeming incongruities.
  - Intelligent characters, who seek to understand the world, and to competently pursue their goals in accordance with their values.
  - A focus on the thought-processes of the characters as they pursue said goals.
  - Themes and topics that relate to the extensive exploration of solution-space, e.g. metaethics, effective altruism, munchkinism, transhumanism.

  **In rational*ist* fiction:**  
  In addition to the above,

  * The author describes rationalist and scientific principles and techniques which can be applied by readers in real life.

    In regards to rational***ist*** fiction, I don't think we need three additional bullets. I think the explicit inclusion of teachable rationalist techniques suffices -- because that's the criterion used when EY pretty much defined the genre back in https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/q79vYjHAE9KHcAjSs/rationalist-fiction with the example of "The World of Null-A" by A.E. Van Vogt.

    - u/oliwhail:
      ```
      > I think the explicit inclusion of teachable rationalist techniques suffices

      Strong agreement.

      I feel uncertain that the first bullet point is necessary as its own point. I might suggest combining the first two bullet points in something like the following way:

      > Rational fiction seeks to explore the plausible moral and material implications of story and setting elements, as well as to examine solutions to problems which might reasonably be uncovered by characters in the story, especially if these solutions violate narrative genre conventions and/or require the application of reason, forethought, and preparation.
      ```

      - u/ArisKatsaris:
        ```
        Your suggestion takes the aspect that I consider most important (the author showing respect for intelligence, reason, forethought, preparation), and makes it the subclause of a subclause, so I think we just disagree on what aspects of rational fiction we consider the most important ones.

  #Rational/ist fiction grounded in formal academic study of rational agents + humanist/transhumanist moral frameworks

  #Originally authored by /u/ishaan123


  **Rationalist Fiction**  attempts to make the reader more rational. Here, "more rational" means more like a "[rational agent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_agent)", a being that acts to [*maximize* a coherent set of *preferences*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann%E2%80%93Morgenstern_utility_theorem) according to a [*logically* consistent,  *empirically* sound, *parsimonious* worldview](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomonoff%27s_theory_of_inductive_inference). 

  Generally, rational fiction encourages us to try to come up with logical explanations for things, and to seek evidence for our beliefs, encouraging the reader towards a scientific, reductionist worldview. It also encourages us to view "simpler" hypotheses about the universe as more plausible - with a notion of "simplicity" that loosely alludes to more mathematically rigorous notions of simplicity in that it not include things that are merely "simple" for humans to think about, such as magical and supernatural explanations. 

  Additionally, it encourages us to build more coherent frameworks concerning our preferences, values, and what we want for the universe. Humanist and transhumanist frameworks are common, and the rejection of death and the notion that acceptance of death as good and natural represents a cognitive bias is a staple of this genre. 

  Finally, it encourages us to be more effective in pursuit of those goals. Explicit discussion of cognitive biases and techniques for identifying and reducing them are discussed, as well as useful heuristics for improving practical behavior.

  **Rational fiction** generally  invokes the same worldview as described above, but does not necessarily attempt to teach the reader in as explicit a manner. The criteria for rational fiction are loose and there is no single necessary nor sufficient criteria. 

  -the use of "common sense" to subvert common narrative tropes is a frequent theme, especially in fanfiction where the original characters did not do so. Sometimes, one character is at an advantage over other characters because they alone are able to use this common sense. Other times, all characters make good use of common sense. This can lead to the characters behaving very differently from what readers generally expect from fictional characters in the genre.

  -Often, characters seek instrumental knowledge or power, or exploits a unique situation that they find themselves in to pursue an ambitious goal. This sometimes involves humanist or transhumanist themes, or plays with consequentialist/utilitarian takes on morality.

  -Particularly in magical fantasy settings, rational and rationalist fiction often gives the sense that someone, whether the author, the narrator, or a character, cares about attempting to come up with logically consistent explanations of the world as presented…even when the world seems to resist such logical explanations. For instance, if magic exists, the characters may note that this means that the universe seems to have special rules which respect human minds, and furthermore they may note that this strange and resists reductionist explanations.

  -It's common for an interplay of conflict and cooperation to revolve around different characters which each have unique set of coherent goals that they are trying to maximize. Some characters may even have completely alien goals, orthogonal to any human values, which they nevertheless pursue rationally. Concepts from game theory are sometimes implicitly or explicitly invoked.

  -Sometimes, none of the characters are especially rational, but it is clear that the underlying world has been constructed by the author with an eye to logical consistency and a careful thinking through of implications. 

  -Sometimes the story itself explores some tangentially relevant philosophical or practical question.

  ...and so on. Generally, "you know it when you see it" applies.

  ##Characteristics of Rational Fiction:


  * Nothing happens solely because 'the plot requires it'. If characters do (or don't do) something, there must be a plausible reason.


  * Any factions are defined and driven into conflict by their beliefs and values, not just by being "good" or "evil".


  * The characters solve problems through the intelligent application of their knowledge and resources.


  * The fictional world has consistent rules, and sticks to them.


  ##In Rational*ist* Fiction:


  As well as the above,


  * Rationalist and scientific methods are used to demystify mysterious phenomena.


  * The story shows rationalist techniques, which can be applied by readers.


  * The story is like a puzzle; readers can reach the same solution as the characters by using the information provided earlier in the story.

  # Cluster of Rationality in Fiction-Space

  ## Originally authored by /u/LieGroupE8

  ---

  ## Sidebar definition

  **Rational fiction** is fiction which specifically emphasizes themes related to **rationality**, where "rationality" loosely refers to a set of ideals such as reason, science, thoughtfulness, learning, excellence, self-improvement, goal-directed behavior, optimal strategy, understanding how things work, and similar ideas. A defining feature of rational fiction is that it strives to stand up to careful reader scrutiny by proceeding *realistically* given the setting, rather than according to standard literary forms or tropes (if these are used, they must be justified independently). Rational works should possess at least one, and preferably both, of the following attributes:

  **Competent** characters: Characters possess at least [Level 1 intelligence](http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/level1intelligent); that is, they act as intelligent agents optimizing to the best of their ability towards their goals. Characters do not ignore obvious opportunities and weaknesses for the sake of the plot.

  **Consistent** settings: Settings obey rigorously applied rules. Every aspect of the plot and setting is a plausible consequence of the underlying rules and the initial setup, and conversely, logical consequences of the rules are not ignored for the sake of the plot.

  These qualities apply to many works of fiction to some degree, but rational fiction respects them with an extra *thoroughness*. Other genres may relax the rules in order to establish a certain payoff: action that sacrifices physics for fun, thrillers that ignore probability for the sake of twists, literary fiction whose oddities are designed to be metaphorical rather than literal. In rational fiction, competence, consistency, and rationality are *themselves* part of the payoff, and are not sacrificed for other considerations.

  **Rationalist** fiction is a subgenre of rational fiction in which reasoning techniques are shown in a way that is realistic and *emulatable* by the reader. Such works explicitly demonstrate techniques from science, logic, probability, game theory, decision theory, or other fields. The story is often structured like a puzzle that the reader can solve by applying such techniques.

  Rational fiction has developed a set of common tropes which convey its aesthetics and ideals, including Munchkinry, Genre-savviness, Deconstruction, Worldbuilding, and others. For a more in-depth list with explanations, please read [the bullet points on the wiki](Link to the following bullet points on wiki). Also check out the [TvTropes definition](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RationalFic) of rational fiction and [Yudkowsky's guide to writing intelligent characters](http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing) to gain a better understanding of the genre. 

  ---

  ## Bullet points for the wiki page

  Although not strictly necessary, works are likely to qualify as rational fiction if they contain some of the following:

  - Intelligent characters: characters are demonstrably intelligent by *real-world* standards

  - Curious characters: characters are curious about their world, and make every effort to resolve their curiosity

  - Genre-savviness: characters are familiar with standard literary tropes and can subvert them

  - Munchkinry: characters attempt to exploit the rules of their world in any way possible

  - Deconstruction: tropes, magic systems, technologies, societies, and other things are reverse-engineered to see what makes them tick

  - Worldbuilding: settings are crafted in meticulous detail, and non-obvious consequences are considered

  - Solvability: Twists and problem solutions are theoretically predictable in advance by the reader with clever enough reasoning

  - Transhumanism: Themes of immortality, self-modification, and existential risk are addressed in depth

  Features commonly seen in stories exhibiting **competence** as applies to rational fiction:

  - The thought processes of characters are described in detail, and these thought processes can be emulated by the reader

  - Characters have a strong respect for knowledge and intellect

  - Characters use every available technique to improve themselves

  - Characters drive the plot, and often try to "munchkin" or exploit their setting to accomplish their goals, or just for fun

  - Characters are curious about why things are the way they are, and try to discover the specific principles behind phenemona

  - Characters are well-read and familiar with standard literary tropes

  Features common in stories that do **NOT** exhibit competence:

  - Character thought processes are not shown, or are shown very little

  - The writing informs us that a character is intelligent without showing it

  - Intelligent characters make deductions like Sherlock Holmes (that is, their deductions are implausible and unlikely to work in real life)

  - Intelligent characters talk like Spock (that is, they think that being smart means ignoring emotions, using the word "logical" a lot, and giving way too many digits of significance in their calculations)

  - Characters do not have much causal agency in the plot; they are just along for the ride

  - Character actions are primarily driven by their emotions, without reflection on whether the actions are intelligent

  - Characters are not curious about their world and do not make an effort to understand phenomena

  Features commonly seen in stories exhibiting **consistency** as applies to rational fiction:

  - The setting is based on precise, coherent, and discoverable rules, and all events in the story conform to these rules

  - The plot proceeds like a simulation of what might actually happen given the established rules; real science is imported as much as possible

  - Secrets and plot twists are hinted at beforehand, usually in a way that allows the reader to potentially think of them in advance

  - Phenomena seen in the story have precise mechanisms which are explained in detail

  - Phenomena, objects, characters, and actions are all entangled together and bound by the rules of the story and their logical consequences

  - If there is any obvious technology or strategy that the background civilization is failing to exploit, a plausible explanation is provided as to why

  Features common in stories **NOT** exhibiting consistency:

  - Little or no effort is made to demonstrate the ground rules of the setting

  - Little or no effort is made to show how and why events happen or how things work

  - Characters encounter many new technologies, wonders, phenomena, etc. that have no relation to anything that comes before or afterward in the story

  - There are implausible coincidences and Deus-Ex-Machinas

  - The writing provides explanations for things that happen, but these explanations are vague, implausible, or full of buzzwords with no moving parts

  - Characters consistently succeed at things despite having plans that are too complicated or kung-fu skills that are implausibly effective; the success of plans or fights is primarily plot-driven rather than a realistic consequence of the setting.

  Features commonly seen in **rationalist** stories:

  - Characters have a deep desire to think and act optimally in all things, and this desire for absolute excellence factors strongly into their character arcs

  - The plot is fundamentally about reasoning, science, optimization, discovery, decision theory, etc., and is driven by them

  - Competence and Consistency pervade the story fractally, apparent throughout at every level of narrative

  - The story has core themes relating to transhumanism, immortality, ethics, Good vs. Good conflicts

  Features common in stories **non-rationalist** stories:

  - Reasoning techniques are not shown explicitly, or are not emulatable by the reader

  - The plot can't be predicted in advance by the reader, even in principle

  - Lack of strong plot focus on themes of reasoning, science, optimization, excellence, etc.

  - Lack of strong plot focus on humanist or transhumanist philosophy

  - Antagonists who are viciously or comically evil without any explanation
