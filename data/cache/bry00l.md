  We've hit over 2,000 views across RR and AO3 in the first couple weeks of release, I'm just floored by that. Thank you all so much for reading. Here we go with the beginning of Arc 2! Expect this one to draw out quite a bit longer.

  First fan art! /u/CopperZirconium did this lovely portrait of a happy couple. Thank you! https://imgur.com/a/zYoqzn0

  Also, Haley's next stat sheet, chapters 7 through... a chapter we haven't reached yet. These are going to stay pretty inconsistent just to dodge minor spoilers. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YizIZKFaiFo98-YAFfaOsf64BfuBIZeGC1fUCRyCH8Y/edit?usp=sharing

    Personally I've never been that interested in character sheets, though they seem a staple of this kind of story. I'd rather the author was making decisions based on what works narratively rather than adhering to the rules of a system

  Boden was the one who let Aslan into the world, and yet this Aslan is not what I expect Boden would have imagined. More specifically, I think Boden wouldn't expect Aslan to kill his brother. Tying into Haley's earlier speculation on story logic, it seems more like Boden allowed the broader story of Aslan into reality, The Problem Of Susan and all, and now that story's got the remaining children in its grip.
  ```

  ```
  When they suddenly teleported to Israel, I honestly expected the entire place to be completely overrun with more Jesus expys. Given the short visit, maybe it actually is? Wonder what the Comedian's deal is.

  Started reading this yesterday. Really looking forward to more!

  ```
  Haley's character sheet says she has a +114 Heal modifier... I don't know much about 3.5e, but I'm pretty sure that should be either +11 or +14.

  EDIT: So, this actually is the rapture, and Jesus is indeed returned--or rather something Jesus-adjacent, yet significantly more bloodthirsty and child-soldier-having than the original. 

  Clearly reality is busting at the seams. It looks to me like there's some combination of "actual other dimensions are blurring into ours" and "human ideas/mythologies are leaking in through our brains." It may in fact be the Rapture, or whatever real-world event the biblical Rapture was foretelling (and Norse Ragnarok, and probably a lot of other End Times Stories too). 

  Current hypothesis: something intentionally threw open the floodgates in an attempt to seize control or resources from the Prime Material Plane. 

  Also, it seems like the Swap is relatively local to Sean and Haley's area--the super-bright flash when Boden was in the chest feels like the same thing that put Sheriff in Sean's head, but none of the kids and seemingly no one in Israel got swapped out.

    whoops! Thank you. That'd make for an interesting time rolling, though.

      ```
      Sure thing! Makes me want to try my hand munchkinning a character with the highest single skill bonus possible. 

      Another typo: "The father wasn't not home yet"

  ```
  Eschatological? That's poop fetish, right?


  (Kidding, kidding. Great story, thanks)

- u/thrawnca:
  ```
  More Mormon references, I see...is there some particular significance to that?
  ```

  - u/FormerlySarsaparilla:
    ```
    This is the kind of thing I don't want to answer due to spoilers, but I'll take that hit because I've already caused some discomfort with other religious references and I should have seen it coming.

    >!Yes, but only as a common thread of characterization, not part of the eschatology being deconstructed in this arc. !<
