In which Peter Pettigrew must rely on creativity rather than raw magical talent as he tries to save the Potters.

(PS: Posting for a friend, all credit for the good parts goes to them!)

  Voldemort is being very effective. Not like a storybook villain at all.

  It's spooky.

  Your friend is onto something good, here. Following.

  Let's hope that either the momentum reference frame is based on your surroundings, not Earth, or that Peter never transforms while on a train!

  So the maximum range of Accio is that which allows a parabola that starts at the speed of a baseball to connect the target to the caster.

  Enchant a tungsten pod with cooling, enter it, drop it into a volcano, sink to the Earth's core, harass anyone with Bludger-level impacts until they put up a shield :/
