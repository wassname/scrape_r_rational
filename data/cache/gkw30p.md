## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  Wildbow's new serial [Pale](https://palewebserial.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/) just went into some concrete mechanics of magical circles. The details are contained in [chapter 1.3](https://palewebserial.wordpress.com/2020/05/16/lost-for-words-1-3/) if you want it straight from the boar's mouth and just want to skip to it. Mild spoilers for Pale follow.

  * Magical circles apply to a specific substance or concept. We only know the symbols for circles about the four classic elements, but they can be much more abstract.

  * The circle either blocks the subject from entering, emits it from the circle, or blocks it from leaving the circle.

  * We've seen circles blocking wind, preventing a campfire's heat from leaving a camp site, and blocking a person's personal connection to their home. 

  * (Good to know but less munchkin-friendly) Circles are technically just instructions to spirits, with their effects mediated through the practitioner's intent, working relationship with the spirits, and history of having performed this kind of effect before.

  * Our protagonists have been encouraged to stick to magic circles about air for now.

  Anyone see any interesting applications so far? It seems like you should pretty easily be able to make a wind engine with what we already know. One of the protagonists has done some inventive work with air circles trying to keep her witch hat on, which was much more convoluted than how I would've done it.

    Oh, so it's basically warding as represented in Worth The Candle. There's plenty of great ones:

    * Ward against blood or bone entering the circle, for massive internal hemorrhage. Depending on the specifics of the environment, pretty much any element you want to omit will damage humans passing through. Just disallowing the entry of Iron (Fe) will probably kill someone with red blood pretty quickly (as their inertia rips the iron in their blood out of their cells) and defend against most blades or projectiles.
    * For non-aggressive purposes, you could get resource refining that's perfectly efficient by ejecting the contaminants from the circle while leaving the metal you want. It'd be rough to do this with solids that don't flow, but you could easily sort liquids and gasses by using a series of circles to allow or disallow specific things. The industrial uses would be endless, unless the total power required exceeds what a person can do.

      Compared to Worth The Candle's wards, circles in Pale seem to be less absolute, and the options are block/emit/insulate instead of block/annihilate. And the normal list of things to apply a circle to are the classical elements plus connections (maybe?), while the normal list in WTC is stuff that has latent magic (notably blood, bone, skin).

      They're obviously drawing from the same inspirations, but I think the "emit" option is really interesting compared to what's normally included in these systems. The first novel combination I thought of was using both emit and block symbols to create a vacuum - literally in the case of air, metaphorically for other things.

  In third party Pathfinder,  a [metacreativity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/psionics-unleashed/classes/psion/psionic-disciplines/metacreativity/) [psion](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/psionics-unleashed/classes/psion/) using [Ectoplasmic Creation](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/psionics-unleashed/psionic-powers/e/ectoplasmic-creation/) can make complex items of nonliving organic matter that last up to one hour with a cantrip. These items can have a volume of 1-20 cubic feet depending on the caster's level. What kind of stuff could this power be used for?
  ```

  - u/MimicSquid:
    ```
    Poisons, venoms, pleasurable drugs, decoy corpses, seemingly murdered doppleganger of someone you want to get out of the way, wooden weaponry or tools, flammable organic liquids like acetone, corrosive organic liquids like hydrochloric acid (stomach acid)....
    ```

    Temporary replacement blood? That might count as living though. Arguably large block of viruses, if those don't count as living. Carved and crafted ivory is on the table too, and could be sold.

    Presumably food.  Provided it's eaten promptly and it's a simple foodstuff, a significant portion of it should be at least partially digested before the one-hour mark is up.  I don't know if this would cause the original constituent atoms to all disappear, though.  If so, it might leave whatever atoms it's bonded to in the meantime behind.  I imagine this might have some weird effects, so a sufficiently clever chemist could perhaps abuse that?

    Also, I don't play tabletop, but a "cantrip" is a trivially simple spell, yes?  Does a cantrip have a limit on how many times you can cast it?

  Something that came to me while reading WtC: Joon is falling from a great height and doesn't have any flight-bestowing or teleportation entads on him.  He does, however, have Sable, with a basically infinite supply of all the useless crap Fenn ever stole just because it wasn't nailed down.  Sadly, she has never stolen anything as practical as a parachute.  He also has a full supply of blood and plenty of bones to play with to increase his speed and strength.

  Could he, at any distance from the ground, slow his descent to a survivable speed by pulling arbitrary heavy objects out and throwing them at the ground as hard and fast as he can?  How fast would he have to eject matter?  Assume he is over some hellish exclusion zone and does not care about smashing it up.  Also the dragons are all busy because one of them said "Shia Labeouf."
