## [RT] [BST] [FF] [Star Wars] A personal challenge: Can I make a Hutt a sympathetic character?

### Post:

The basic premise: 

Our Protagonist's name is Zira, they use ey/em/eir pronouns, and yes, ey're a Hutt. Ey're growing up on a shit desert planet somewhere in the Outer Rim, somewhere around 10 BBY. Eir father is raising em to take over their branch of the Cartel, and on this particular planet, their main line is slaves. 

After a massive slave result breaks out, Zira attempts to convince eir dad that maybe slavery is bad for business. This is partly because ey think that the gargantuan cost of feeding and watering slaves on a desert planet is immense. But it's also because ey was shaken by the slave revolt, and ey may also have some slightly juvenile ideas about the importance of freedom in general (and the freedom of Zira the Hutt in particular). 

Eir dad basically tells em, "You are a snot-nosed kid, you don't actually understand what's going on here. You think you can do better, fine. Go. But you're not coming back."

Zira does go, and resolves both to grow a bigger operation than eir dad ever did and completely obliterate eir dad's, all without taking a single slave. 

Along the way, ey meet a ridiculously cute Toydarian girl and her large overly-friendly family, deal with a protocol-droid-turned-assassin, and get tangled up with the nascent Rebellion.

Can ey reach eir goal without getting emself killed- and, equally important, can eir ideals survive getting hit in the face with cold hard reality? 

--------------

Other things of importance- 

- The aliens in Star Wars canon are criminally under-played-around-with, ESPECIALLY in the movies and especially-especially if they're not human-shaped. This fic is meant to rectify that.
- In this fic, Huttese is the language translated into English; Basic is the strange and foreign conlang. 
- Plot-important, non-incompetent: Gungans, droids, Wookiees (with more characterisation than 'crossbow-carrying carpet cares about human'), Hutts by the scads, Toydarians, probably more as I keep writing
- Non-humanity as default. Alien as default. Humans are on the sidelines- they're the Stock Bad Guy or the Stock Minor Character. 
- Mostly fast-paced fun Crime Hijinks, with a side of politicking and a squinch of philosophy.

Does this sound like something anyone would be interested in? If so, what are some problems you can see with the idea, and what are some things you'd like to see included?

  That premise looks interesting and I would like to read this story. Unfortunately the small text you provided was completely unreadable to me. I thought I was in favor of gender neutral pronouns, but after trying to read that I'm no longer sure.

    The gender neutral pronouns are going to be problematic and immersive breaking; I think Orion's arm is the only place I've seen it done well and even there is often broke what otherwise is a lot of YMMV fun and physics porn.  Do what you want; if it bothers me too much that is what replace all scripts or text to speech pronunciation customization is for.

    That said: write it. I look forward to reading it and hope you pull it off well.  I'd challenge you to make the slavers sympathetic too, not arguing for that choice, slavery IMHO is a capital E evil, but as written Zira has been inculcated in a society (I'm not the best on the expanded universe but Hutts=Mafioso) where slavery is normal and a sign of admirable status, so there's probably some initial cached thoughts pointing along the chain slaveholder -> power -> good.

  This is an excellent premise. I've always thought the Hutts were fantastic characters to write about. If you need ideas, you could give [Tales from Jabba's palace](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/353476.Tales_from_Jabba_s_Palace) a read. It's a compilation of shorts from the perspectives of the various alien denizens there, including the slave dancer Twi'lek and the Rancor master. To make us involved with the protagonist you could focus on the treachery and backstabbing that's business as usual in the cartel.  Really looking forward  to your first chapter.

  Are you going to be rationalizing the aliens' evolutionary and cultural histories? 

  One of the reasons I havn't touched my star warsish ratfic project in a long time is that every time an alien says or does anything, if I want to do them justice, if I want to avoid anthropomorphising them, I have to descend so far into the task of fleshing out their natural and social history that I usually don't come out again.

  You avoid this if you're just importing star wars' aliens and taking the superficial characterizations from canon as the word of god.. but I sense you might not want to do that. You want to get into their heads and the only way to do that is to get into their evolutionary history.

    I was about to say "to an extent" but then I realised, yes, that's exactly what I'm doing. Or at least, trying to give them any *semblance* of their own culture at all, and part of that has to come from their shape.  

    Legends!canon is actually kind of decent to the Hutts - not *good*, but kind of decent. (In the words of my friend: "wait, Hutts are cool?!" There are plausible reasons for why they do what they do, some attempt has been made to get into their heads, they have some semblance of a history and a culture that could be fleshed out and expanded upon... 

    But for some of the species I want to use (like Toydarians or Gungans or basically anything that was a dumbshit idea from the prequels) people have decided to cut their losses and move on. Which means I need to do exactly what you said.

    (Honest-to-god, I'm excited about the Toydarians. They're significantly cooler than presented in canon, especially movie!canon.)

    Most of what I'm interested in IS on the linguistic/cultural side of things (I'm an English major, sue me), but you can't have culture and language without it being informed by body shape and size because slapping human cultures onto aliens is just twee and bland and blehhhhh. 

    At the same time, you have to keep them relatable enough that a human reader can at least understand what's going on with some explication. There's a reason my protag is a bit of an odd duck by Hutt standards. xD

  FYI for people who may question the need for non-standard pronouns here: [All Hutts are hermaphrodites.](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Hutt/Legends#Life_Cycle)

    ```
    Well, if I got the singular 'they' hater to approve, I'm off to a great start!

  ```
  I will have to comment in more detail later, because I shouldn't even be awake right now and have to get to bed pronto, but I love everything about this and eagerly await a story to arise from this. 

  (Also, am I correct in inferring that you like aliens in general, and not just SW aliens?)
  ```

  - u/NotATem:
    ```
    I freaking love aliens. :D Non-humanity is cool, regardless of where it comes from. 

    (And thank you! Omg.)
    ```

- u/MoralRelativity:
  ```
  I'd read that.
