    It just wants a Fudge Revelation (tm)

    My theory: hard takeoff has *already happened* with a mostly-friendly AI that, rather than maximizing happiness, money, or paperclips, is trying to maximize **whimsy**
    ```

    - u/IICVX:
      ```
      Or maybe minimize global comprehensibility, because there's some sort of memetic threat out there that invades understandable worlds.
      ```

      - u/immortal_lurker:

        Possibly they want it below a certain threshold, but this world doesn't seem to be minimally comprehensible. It still has comprehensible  things like news organizations, countries, and universities. Even if all of those things are all deeply weird.

  If the sentient AI is connected to the internet by some gazztromple and wins a golden ticket, is the ticket won by the kid or by the AI?

    AI is of an appropriate age.

      The kid will be going to the factory, though as a guardian
      ```

        I really hope the ~~paperclip~~ fudge maximizer gets to be on the roster.

        Also, I think we all know how *this* universe ends up.

          It would fit the pattern! Obsessed with incompleteness, obsessed with vaping, obsessed with the ocean, obsessed with fudge...

  “Oh, fuck off already with the sarcasm. I took every precaution. I typed up Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics and pasted it inside a comment immediately preceding his core programming. That totally counts."

  No it doesn’t! It really doesn’t! 

  Also, Void, Air, and Water so far. Are Earth and Fire next?
  ```

  - u/RiggSesamekesh:
    ```
    Isn't earth the fudge kid?
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      Earth to represent Fudge? And Fire to represent hate, for Chili?
      ```

        I predict Chili will solve the riddle by punching the screen.

      ```
      no, see, the AI is water-cooled

    What will the sixth element be then? Aether?

      Chocolate?

  ```
  You know how there is that sentence, that claims you can read words even when the letters in the middle of words are in a random order, as long as the first and the last letter are in the correct places? And the claim itself is written with the middles of the words permuted like that? This story feels a bit like that. Like it makes more sense than any individual piece of it can justify. Illusion? Truth?
  ```

  - u/CreationBlues:
    ```
    Style, mood, atmosphere. Imagine a song with nonsense lyrics. The verbal component is basically white noise, but the melody exists and is the reason why you like the song.
    ```

  - u/fljared:
    ```
    It helps, I think, that it's piggybacking on the original Ronald Dahl books. You already been primed for a world where gum can cause massive size changes, so having it go a little bit further *works*.

    [’Twas brillig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jabberwocky), and the slithy toves

    Didst gyre and gimbal in the wabe.

    All mimsy were the borogroves

    And the mome raths outgrabe.

      I actually rather enjoyed the movie adaptation of the last mimzy.

      The IBM logo written in atoms was a nice touch.
      ```

- u/LimeDog:
  ```
  So I'm thinking that ticket winners are people who have a good idea of their core utility function, and give an answer along those lines.

  The artist left a blank.

  The layabout put something about vaping.

  The cultist put something about the ocean.


  I'm currently wondering if the candidates will be representative of the perceived sins of the current era in some way, similar to the books. 

  The only current hole I have in that idea is that I can't figure out what the artist represents. The cultist seems to be small world, extreme ideologies that tend to spread around closed groups. The layabout could be apathetic sentiment or disconnecting from society, but it feels a bit tenuous.

  The humor in this one is much less to my liking than the others. Both parts. Mostly the Tide Honey, stuff.
