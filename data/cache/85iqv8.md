**Pre-writeup Notes**

If this is not a proper venue for me to post this sort of thing, I'll (well, perhaps not *happily*, but) willingly cease doing so.

Eleven chapters is what I'd consider to be bordering on a binge-reading, but it is at this point that I have decided that yes, I definitely do want to do a bit of a write-up. I'd like to do future installments over fewer chapters at a time in order to be more detailed, as well as to draw out my own enjoyment as long as possible. As such, this post won't really be following the format I expect to use for ongoing chapters, as I plan to do those a bit like a livepost -- as if I was pausing an animation repeatedly to jot down notes.

I would like to ask that you avoid spoiling anything I have not gotten to, as well as to avoid pointing out foreshadowing or such that I appear to have missed. Feel free to lead me astray from predicting future surprises though if you like, so long as you're clever with it; I know I've had plenty of fun doing that in the Steven Universe fandom (If you don't know what surprise I'm referring to, you haven't watched SU, haven't watched far enough, or haven't spent more than a minute thinking about it.)

Finally, the things I've had spoiled for me:

[Spoiler](#s "Something something mages might be brainwashed demons? Not sure if that was fact or theory, but it was interesting enough that it got me to start reading The Good Student. In a surprise turn of events, my terrible memory works in my favor for once since I don't remember the specifics!")

[Spoiler](#s "It might be possible to lie to demons? Or something? Something about lying to a demon successfully. I don't remember the details.")

[Spoiler](#s "Also people mentioning that Simole is a certified badass which I am 100% already on board with.")

That said, let's get to the actual write-up.

**The Story Thus Far**

Our protagonist, Nic, is a young boy with the story starts. He's raised by a poor working-class single mother, and has a playmate who is rapidly revealed to be way out of his league socio-economically. But is that in that gets him his initial education and forms the basis for his drive to be the best student like no one ever was.

He places 2nd nationally, allowing him to go from ~~po-dunk Arkansas~~ a middling school in a somewhat populated town/city to a prestigious and selective high school. Nearly all the other students are from well-off families. ~~Unfortuantely, he's drafted into the Host Club when he breaks a vase.~~ He might even have the possibility of going off to Magical College if he works hard enough!

His fellow outcasts are the Also-Rans, four students who (Nic included) are there by merit rather than wealth and are looked down upon by faculty and study body alike. Except for Simole. Even the local prince seems to be learning very quickly you don't fuck with ~~Daenerys~~ Simole. (No, I haven't watched Game of Thrones. I probably know just enough to get in trouble.)

I'm fairly confident that I saw his not-so-great interactions at the school with his long-lost childhood friend coming a mile away, but was pleasantly surprised that he seems to have taken it in stride. Actually, Nic seems to be taking just about anything and everything in stride.

**Thoughts**

You know, this story is really reminding me of HPMOR in all the right ways. I understand that overly competent child protagonists is a very tired trope, but it feels like it's being done right here. Rather than naturally talented, Nic's just very goal-oriented and hard working. He does make mental leaps that seem very bright for a kid in school, but they're within the bounds of what's believable for a kid that's just read a shitton.

The very subtle not-quite-right moments are lovely. "Just the four of us" was great. Nic going into the library with the herb-detector at night, and it shrieking at the pagoda beyond the window, whew.

And the *snark*. Dear lord.

> “Or maybe Nic. Why don’t you ask her?”

> Nic slowly realised he was being addressed. “Ask who, what?”

> Davo shook his head and waved a dismissive hand at Nic. “It’s nothing. No need for you to concern yourself with our petty problems. Go back to daydreaming about Hostern’s Equation of Dynamic whatever.”

> “Equivalence,” said Nic. 

> “Nobody likes a pedant, Nic,” said Davo.

> “Examiners do,” said Nic, pedantically.

More of this, please.

I'm already seeing an interesting dynamic between Simole and Dizzy. Dizzy seems to have complicated feelings regarding Nic, and Simole is just here to roll her eyes enigmatically at anything and everything, Dizzy's weirdness included. Actually, wait, let me get the next section ready-

**Complaints?**

So far, I think the story is maybe failing the Bechdel Test so far. Yeah, I know, it's a magical society and doesn't seem to have even had a Renaissance of any kind, much less an actual Woman's Emancipation movement. Hell, the alsorans even have a brief conversation about a famous female mage, and how she's female and whether her gender is a reason to point her out specifically. But it's kinda annoying that the first time I see two females talking its... about... a guy. *forehead smack* So close, yet so far. 

Yes, Nic is the protagonist, and yes the primary thing these two girls have in common is that they have different relationships to Nic, but surely there were other interesting conversations between two females we could have been privy to. Dizzy and the Librarian? Dizzy and Nic's mom? *Simole* and the *Librarian*? Please, please don't let this turn into a two-bit harem story. So many good anime are ~~ruined~~ tortuously weighed down by adding in a harem, then making that as much a focus as whatever actually got me interested in the first place. My one hope is that Simole never develops any kind of romantic feelings towards Nic and just continues to be a complete badass laughing at the strange frivolities of others.

After taking a second to think over yet, yes, they did at least discuss something that wasn't a guy. Or, wait, was the veiled threat about starting trouble Simole implying that Dizzy's father would do something about her. *remove hand, forehead smack a second time*

**Closing Thoughts**

I've already stayed up far too late reading eleven chapters, then writing and posting this. I'm going to do my best not to go right back to reading it the second I wake up tomorrow, but I'm very much looking forward to it. I'm thinking I'll try to do 1-2 chapters at a time, writing down my thoughts as I go then composing them into a write-up afterwards. If you have an questions or thoughts, feel free to lob them my way.

  Thanks for the write-up, guess it's finally time for me to pick this serial up as well.

  Mages as brainwashed demons is a wild speculation of mine, don't mind that. (I'll say, though, that I have a history of successfully predicting mega-scale plot twists months in advance — have you read *Twig* perchance? — as well as connecting smallest hints and word choices into absurd metafictional singularitian conspiracy theories with probability of correctness approaching zero for mild amusement. Take of that what you will.)

    I've read Worm and Pact (and both tons and tonnes of Worm fanfiction), but couldn't get into Twig.

    And yeah, give me a little time to read further into The Good Student and I'm sure I'll start making wild speculation as well.
