## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  I want to write an SCP tale which, at one point, involves a character traveling about ~500 years into the past. The trip is one-way. The character in question is a woman with a Ph.D. in physics. The question is: what should she take with her?

  Assume that she has to fit whatever it is she can take into a bag she can reasonably carry. Also, she understands that she has to time-travel only a few hours before she has to use the time machine, so while she has a few hours to make a trip to the local hardware/electronics/something else store, she does not have a lot of time to procure materials.

    Seeds would probably be among the most valuable things to bring, since modern GM crops are vastly more productive than the crops of 500 years ago, and there's no way she would be able to duplicate them in her lifespan. Aside from that, a topographical map and a good compass (one with marked out bearings) would be absurdly useful for navigating. A map of current or historical mining sites to go along with that would give her a huge advantage.

    However, to survive long enough for any of that to matter, she'll probably need to start with warm clothes, a raincoat, several pairs of socks, a cooking pot, a hatchet, a good pair of hiking shoes, a tent and sleeping bag, a lighter, a gun, a magnifying glass, a knife, a rope, some clear plastic bags (garbage and resealable), some water bottles, and enough trail mix and/or hard candy to last her for at least a week.

    Where in the world is she travelling from? And does she have to end up in the same place? THis will make a hell of a lot of difference, to the extent that I would spend some of the time travelling to a city which still existed 500 years ago and where women are treated less badly if at all possible. Even If I could do this I'd make sure I was wearing modest dress or dress as a man of the period if I could pull it off.

    For modern things to sell I would add needles and spices as they were worth a lot by weight. And if I was still menstruating I'd bring several mooncups, and if fertile I would stock the hell up on birth control.

      +1. It's a much cheaper way of getting cash than what I had in mind.

      > birth control

      Optimize with abstinence. If worried about rape, take pepper spray, taser, gun, or as a last resort, day after pills.

    A solar powered computer. Send it back in time to run a computation for 500 years. Find it and record the data before sending its replacement back in time to continue. Repeat until solving whatever problem you want.

  You gain the preternatural ability to roll dice to whichever side you want every single time provided the dice have the following properties

  * are platonic solids
  * are, at most, only 5% more likely to land on any side than any other side. (your skill doesn't work on weighed dice)
  * are capable of being picked up by you with at most both arms, and at minimum two fingers, without the use of chemical bonds
  * aren't capable of switching which face is which (such as, for example, through the use of lcd screens).
  * aren't self-propelled

  Restrictions that *don't* exist on your ability include:

  * you don't need to know the starting state of the dice.
  * even if something interferes with the die while it's being rolled, but doesn't actually stop the die from rolling, it'll still land on your intended face. (Although if an external force completely stops the roll, your power doesn't set the state of the die.)

  You have until January 1st 2020 to become the richest person in the world. Can you do it?

  (as per usual, your utility function gets replaced with "become richest person in the world," although this doesn't actually give you any more willpower.)

    Well I think I know a way to use the dice to generate free energy, however given the limits on the size of the dice that won't be of much real use until the singularity (after which your artificial body might well be a megastructure and that 5% difference in dice fairness could correspond to absurd amounts of mass). However that isn't going to be game breaking over the desired timescales, but luckily I also thought of a way to use it to generate many types of arbitrary information.

    How this works is that since dice are actually deterministic it should be possible to make a machine that nudges the dice in midair so that it lands on a particular side, given machines can reliably predict a coin flip in the air this seem highly plausible. Then the trick is to have that machine keep hitting the dice to keep it in midair for a while (but still a definitely finite amount of time so it will eventually land).                 
    Now the way you use this to leverage the information about the future, is to make it so that the most likely way the machine stops hitting the dice and makes sure it's last hit would make it land on the desired number is for the machine to detect some change in stock prices or the like.

    Basically you rely on the fact that the power must necessarily be able to manipulate quantum events and massively leverage the butterfly effect in order to work in every conceivable scenario it has to work in. Thus even if it only achieves this manipulation through somehow controlling your body it still effectively works the same way as a probability pump. So all you need to do is arrange your setup so that the easiest way for it to get the dice to roll a specified number is for it to manipulate the stock market or some other systems.                            
    The real important thing to keep in mind is that the odds of your machine malfunctioning need to be smaller than the odds of whatever event you are trying to cause. I am also assuming it's control over you in how it makes you roll the dice doesn't extend back in time too far, otherwise it might try to mess with your mind in order to ensure you never build your probability pump or other such things.

    Anyway as for becoming the richest person alive by 2020 that should be easy by just messing with the stock market. Once I was the richest person alive i'd probably use it by hooking my machine up to prediction markets or something else quantifiable so as to control world affairs massively by having many dice in the air for years, with machines hooked up to let them down when future events occurred.

      That's a really interesting writeup! Unless someone comes in that can disprove it/do it better, I'm hereby awarding you the "won at internet" medal ;)

    ```
    By what method does the die land on that side? Telekinesis? Is the probability mass for the desired side funnelled from the others on a timeline-manipulation level?
    ```

- u/Ephemeralen:
  ```
  According to google, the energy in a lightning strike propagates at approx. 1/3 of lightspeed.

  "Riding the Lightning" is an oft-seen electrical superpower.

  A 13-pound Pikachu moving at 0.3~c which strikes a stationary object would impart kinetic energy equivalent to a 7-megaton shaped nuclear blast.

  Do with that what you will.
