  Apologies for the delay on this one; this was probably the worst month and a half I've had, as far as sickness goes, particularly with a bout of norovirus going through my family, then a different cold a few days after that. (*Worth the Candle* has been running for quite a while now, through weddings, family vacations, a number of times being sick, and two seasons worth of seasonal depression, but I'm usually better able to manage it.) This is also a pretty big batch of chapters, which is a contributing factor to the ~46 days between chapter releases.

  You can [support me on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/alexanderwales), as many fine people already have. If you'd like to track chapter progress and get ETAs, there's a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PaLrwVYgxp_SYHtkred7ybpSJPHL88lf4zB0zMKmk1E/edit?usp=sharing) that gets updated roughly every night ([the discord](https://discord.gg/8MdWg2r) is also fairly good for that, but quickly descends into insanity when there's a drought).
  ```

  - u/CouteauBleu:
    ```
    Yeah, it's really impressive how many chapters you put in these updates.

    I kept thinking "Okay, now this *had* to be the cliffhanger... no, wait, there's still a 'Next page' button".
    ```

  - u/sicutumbo:

    > but quickly descends into insanity when there's a drought

    I resent the implication that it doesn't descend into insanity even when there isn't a drought.

    I get happy every time there's a release. My happiness doesn't correlate well with the size of the release, though. If you'd released this over 7 separate occasions, rather than in one big release, I'd be even happier. But thanks either way!

  > [Juniper, I know you might want to, but we can’t fight it. It’s hundreds of feet tall, dropping down from the clouds then going back up. There are dozens of legs and eyes that must be the size of human heads to be visible from street level. Joon, please, I’m telling you now that if there was ever a chance to stop this thing from being called down, we failed at it, and we can’t even begin to think about fighting it. This is bigger than us. The Empire is going to get called in. They’ve got thousands of mages and magic beyond anything that we do.]

  You can *taste* the despair of Mary realizing that Joon is almost pathologically incapable of understanding "run away before the thing kills you", and that he's going to get killed trying to do the boss fight.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```

    ```

  - u/Se7enworlds:
    ```
    I think Joon really needs his WWUD bangle just for clarification during these situations. She's the one who believes in Narrative.
    ```

    - u/CouteauBleu:
      ```
      We already know that Joon's playthrough probably works with different rules than Uther's. Joon lost Fenn whereas Uther never lost a knight.

      (though he never tried dating one either)

      (that we know of)
      ```

      - u/Se7enworlds:
        ```
        He's still the Hero That Leaps Into Action though. 

        I tend to see the difference's between Joon and Uther as differences of genre. Like the difference between an English Tea Room mystery and Crime Noir as to how likely the protagonist is to get beaten to a Pulp.

        Arther was always a participant in the Great Adventure, the typical Fantasy hero, working the story from the perspective of a player, never knowing how far the DM would go and so more willing to Sally Forth which meant that the DM had to hold back to keep the game going. Joon being from the other side of the cardboard wall, thinks that in the DM's place he wouldn't hold back which introduced a very different meta-tension and allows for threats to be applied in a different way.

        Both of them fill the same role however, even if the genre is different, so the likelihood of them holding back is small.

        And in any case, she believes in the Narrative from her own perspective, regardless of what Joon thinks, which makes it strange that she would invoke the challenge of the threat like that, unless she's deliberately playing a role to fulfill Narrative conventions and create a MetaImpetus for Joon to defeat it?
        ```

  - u/RMcD94:
    ```
    To me that read like someone trying to convince Joon who doesn't know what Joon is like.

    Doesn't sound like Mary at all. I thought she was comprised
    ```

    - u/PresentCompanyExcl:
      ```
      A convincing line would be "its an endgame, LVL 100 threat, what did you do to underleveled chars who ran towards endgame threats?"
      ```

    - u/Fresh_C:
      ```
      To me it almost sounds like a narrative trap.

      If you want the hero to go face the big bad monster you don't tell them how easy it will be. You tell them how big and impossible the task is to handle and really talk up the threat.

      It's the type of thing that Narrative focused Mary should know not to say like that.
      ```

  Ch 147
  > “Friends, after a single day?” I asked.
  “It’s easy to make friends if you know how,” replied Lisi

  *Lisi doesn't strike me as the type who knows how to make friends*...
  > “She uh,” Reimer swallowed. “She gave me a hand job.”

  Ahhhh. How to Make Friends: Lisi edition.

  Ch 154
  > I dipped into my soul and spirit to give them another glance. There was nothing out of the ordinary there though, and I felt like myself.

  This is Mr Wales answering the question of whether Amaryllis tampered with Joon's soul.

  And Bethel was the star of this batch for me, her POV was so much fun, right up there with the first Valencia POV chapter. AW does a great job with her internal narrative and 'voice'. Her plan to write an entire book listing all the ways she could kill someone, to give to people annoying her, was hilarious, as was her struggle not to declare war on the locus because it prevented her from spying within it.

  Re: Bethel/Joon, ch 146
  >  “I think I also probably like you better **as a friend** than she does.”

  >“Hrm,” said Bethel. She sighed and looked away from me.

  >...

  >“Sorry,” I said. “I got off topic. I really do want to talk to you about your own stuff.”

  >“Perhaps another time,” said Bethel. “I believe I’ve gotten something from this conversation, more than I was seeking, in fact.

  I was puzzling over what Bethel meant in regards to that final sentence but the reveal that she's into Joon clarifies it a lot.

    Another thing to add to the ol’ résumé: Juniper Smith—multimage, DM extraordinaire, international man of mystery, totally irresistible to ostensibly asexual sentient houses.
    ```

    - u/WTFwhatthehell:
      ```
      I kinda like that it's screwing with the endless self insert harem stories. 

      He's surrounded by people who want to have sex with him! Only it's mostly just awkward because one looks like gimli, beard and all. One's a serial killer house, ones a deamon eating pseudo child, ones an alien deer and if the 2 girls he's actually into ones dead and the others asexual but in it for the power enough to lie back and think of levelups. And it's all super awkward because he doesn't want to hurt anyone.
      ```

      - u/GrafZeppelin127:
        ```
        Agreed. It shines a light on how gross and awkward that tired old masturbatory trope can be when there are people that behave like *actual people* involved.
        ```

        - u/WTFwhatthehell:
          ```
          Alternatively: a lot of the author self insert harem protagonists act like psychopaths with the world bending around them such that it just happens that nobodies feelings get hurt. 

          I'm not gonna knock it *as a mastabatory trope*. People can enjoy a sexual fantasy now and then but it tends to grate in stories that try to be otherwise serious.

          Though this story is crying out for an omake chapter where he wakes up from a really heavy night of drinking and the notification of 

          Achievement Progress: A Key For Seven Locks (7/7)!

          And all the awkwardness as he realises he fucked the deer.
          ```

  - u/Sparkwitch:
    ```
    Woe the oblivious harem protagonist. Raven seemed similarly disillusioned by such information in her talk with Grak. Huh, and Amaryllis too with her "if" at the end of that conversation.

    I have a theory that maybe Ropey's marriage to Bethel changed her to become more loyal to/loving of Juniper in particular? I don't know if there's strong direct evidence of this, but it makes sense to me in a vague and hand-wavey sort of way.

    >There was nothing out of the ordinary there though, and I felt like myself.

    This is weeks later. We know souls reset quickly enough that people have made daily modifications to keep them in line. This is not particularly strong evidence.
    ```

    - u/sparkc:
      ```
      It means that Amaryllis would have had to take upon herself all the risks associated with manipulating Joon's soul for the benefit of only one week of soul fucked Joon (he was always very likely to spend the second week in a 'coffin'), a week in which his schedule was mostly tied up at the athenaeum. There were many possibilities put forward regarding what Amaryllis hoped to gain and why such a risk would be justified. Those possibilities have been greatly reduced, especially the possibilities with the most benefit.

      I think those still unconvinced would be mostly limited to Word of God at this point to have their minds changed but further evidence from the chapter was that the SOC superbeing Val spent time with Joon on two different occasions (and Amaryllis too) and noticed nothing awry. Circling back to the previous point, this limits Amaryllis to changes to Joon's soul that Val can not detect and requires a world in which Val can not read the treachery on Amaryllis' face.

      Then from the doylist perspective, AW wrote Joon checking his soul with full knowledge of the soulfucking discussion. It was either intended to clarify that Amaryllis did not mess with Joon's soul or it was intended as a fake out. I guess people can decide for themselves if such a fake out would feel like a cheap trick or enhance the eventual reveal.

      FWIW too, going forward there is no stronger evidence that can be given in future chapters than Joon having checked his own soul just under two weeks out and noting nothing amiss.
      ```

      - u/AHippie:
        ```
        He also explicitly thinks about how he felt about Fenn and the trajectory those feelings have taken since she died. I agree, AW was being as clear as he needed to be.

      ```
      Oh, of course. But it's worth a try at least. In Joon's defense, he's really discombobulated.

- u/swaskowi:

  For other people curious, Mome Rath is mentioned a few times, first by Masters, as an item on a list composed by Uther as a test for dream skewered. Juniper has no recollection of it, nor does Raven, or Lisi, or Reimer, and those are the only other mentions of it until the last line of this batch.

  The ethics professor basically told them she had an exit-strategy, and they did not catch it. - She said she knew it was a risk when she took the job, she lied when she said she did not see it coming, and she was completely calm about the whole thing. I take the sum of all this to mean she set up a highly reliable escape plan either before she took the job at all, or pretty much immediately upon arrival.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Yeah, it retrospect the whole conversation was basically her saying "I'm fine, please don't stick your noses in where they don't belong and mess things up"

  Claret Spear!

  Still magic!

  Vibration magic!

  Blood magic spell that almost immediately gets superseded by still magic!

  Bethel being snarky!

  Interpersonal drama!

  Confirmation that Amaryllis didn't soulfuck Joon and all that discussion was overreacting!

  The burning dude is called Harold!

  Really, just fantastic chapters all around. I'm glad that we didn't get 20k more words about Joon going to class, because that would have dragged on quite a bit. I wanted to see Joon actually using still and vibration magic, and he had a chance to use still magic, but I'm content to wait till next release. I'm also wondering if still and vibration magic will extend to people through symbiosis, which will again have to wait until next release.

  I sure hope that Bethel stole some books on still and vibration magic from whatever library S&S has, because Joon has been hampered in the past from not knowing abilities that someone of his skill should easily be able to accomplish, as seen in this batch.

  Valencia's loyalty up came because Joon had previously said that she shouldn't ever look at him with a devil in her or he would never speak to her again, and he implicitly gave her permission to do so again.

  Maybe the Space Plate plus Warder's sight or just Bethel could recover Pallida's hat? Kinda doubt it though.

  So Uther knew: Blood, Still, Star, Warding, Soul, Spirit, and probably Vibration magic. Possibly Flower magic as well.

  I really wonder how Joon plans to fight something so enormously huge. Maybe there's some weakness only he knows about, some part of its nature that makes it easier for a single person to kill?

  The Claret Spear should allow Joon to teleport longer distances with the Ring of the Broken World, if the spear counts as part of himself. That could allow some neat tricks.

    100%. I'm pretty sure Reimer mentioned something about the learning status effort also being applied with a book (really almost anything), not just a teacher. It just can't be ex nihilo. I'm not sure how much that leaves experimentation, theorizing, and the scientific method on the table, though.

      Can teleport such that he is still touching the volume of space where he was previously standing, preserving momentum. So normally he can only teleport at most the distance of his arm span horizontally, and in most cases less than that, but if the spear counts as a part of himself then the range is much greater.

  Long time, no see! Been wondering what we've been up to over on **[the *Worth the Candle* wiki](https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Worth_the_Candle_Wiki)**? ...No? Too bad, I'm telling you anyway...

  First of all, the **main page** has had a bit of an overhaul - there's now a widget for the Discord server (where most discussion for the wiki takes place), a little fanart gallery, and a "roll the dice" button that'll take you to a random page. Speaking of fanart, we've recently had [this artwork of Grak](https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/File:GrakhuilLeadbraidsSpiral.jpg) - courtesy of spiral on the Homestuck Discord.

  Daniel111111222222's been diligently putting out more **chapter summaries,** rounding out Book I with chapters 11-14 ("[A Winding Course](https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/A_Winding_Course)", "[Life of the Party](https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Life_of_the_Party)", "[Time Out](https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Time_Out)", "[Elevator Facts](https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/ELEVATOR_facts)"), starting on Book II with chapters 15-20 ("[Whys and Wherefores](https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Whys_and_Wherefores)", "[Kindly Bones](https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Kindly_Bones)", "[Voting Blocs](https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Voting_Blocs)", "[Communal](https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Communal)", "[Montage!](https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Montage!)", "[Desert Course](https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Desert_Course)"), and skipping ahead to some more recent chapters ("[Piece of Mind](https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Piece_of_Mind)", "[Commingling](https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Commingling)", "[Monty Haul](https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Monty_Haul)"). u/Makin's made a full summary for *[The Council of Arches](https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/The_Council_of_Arches)* - the side story. And for the [Council of Arches](https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Council_of_Arches) - the organisation.

  Wondering who [Karen Dowler](https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Karen_Dowler) and [Lena Kordrew](https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Lena_Kordrew) were? We sure weren't, but MiddleTwin and Daniel have made pages for them anyway. Some more important **characters** - [Tiffany Archer](https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Tiffany_Archer), [Thomas Clint](https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Thomas_Clint), [Craig](https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Craig), [Maddie](https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Maddie), [Larkspur Prentiss](https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Larkspur_Prentiss), [Heshnel Elec](https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Heshnel_Elec) and the entirety of [Fireteam Blackheart](https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Fireteam_Blackheart) - have received pages courtesy of Makin. Newcomer Lumbjack has contributed a page for the biggest of bads - [Fel Seed](https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Fel_Seed)!

  Some good headway's being made on the pages for **magic,** thanks to MiddleTwin's contributions of [bone magic](https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Bone_Magic), [blood magic](https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Blood_magic), [essentialism](https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Essentialism) and an overview for [magic](https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Magic) in general. They've also contributed a page for [the Host](https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/The_Host).

  Makin's done a page on the [dream-skewered](https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Dream-skewered), and Daniel's done a pretty comprehensive write-up for [void](https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Void). Together, they've finally tackled one of the big pages we've been putting off - the [game layer](https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Game_layer)! You might also want to check out Makin's page for the [party](https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Party), his [list of achievements](https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_Achievements), and his [list of quests](https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_Quests) too. I mentioned his [list of entads](https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_entads) last time, but it's had some significant edits since then.

  Now, I won't say his name... but, after countless hours of research and the deaths of several D-Class personnel, [the cannibal](https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Shia_LaBeouf) finally has a page of his own. Visit at your peril.

  The Discord widget was made possible with the [DiscordIntegrator](https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Template:DiscordIntegrator) **template,** which also lets us place the widget in the sidebar of every page. I've added a [speculation](https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Template:Speculation) template for citation - please don't use it unless you have to! On the opposite end of the spectrum, you're encouraged to use the new [spoilers](https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Template:Spoilers) template on every page that spoils the story's big twists. Oh, and there's a new template for formatting stuff in the scary red font used for [game warnings](https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Template:Gw).

  Whew! It's been a busy couple of months, but we still need all the help we can get. As always, I'd like to point people to [the TVTropes page](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WorthTheCandle) for the story - linking to that page from various trope pages can really help the story's audience grow. As for the wiki itself, [it's now at the point where CRJ himself can start using it as a resource](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/al7z2v/rt_worth_the_candle_ch_147148_terrorsvibrations/efbnpat)! If you can spare the time, contributing to the wiki is a great way to show your support for the story - those of us on the Discord would be more than happy to guide you through the process.

    Presumably, the plan was to level the place if they went missing. 

    On the other hand, that would be a great afternoon for Bethel: find a royal function in Angeclynn, replace the coat check with yourself, allow the rich and famous to deposit their entads into you, then peace out before they come back.

  > As I was watching, a giant leg came down from the sky, knotted and gnarled, ending in claws as big as cars that dug deep into the earth. A second leg joined it, seeming to come from the clouds themselves, this one piercing straight through Canis Building some distance away. The creature descended slowly, but with the slowness of immense weight, other legs coming down to join the first two, until finally its bulk descended down from the cloud cover. People around me were screaming and running, and all I could do was stare. It had hundreds of eyes, long legs like a water strider, and a coating of short hair that moved without regard for the wind. Its head swept from side to side, and its many-jawed mouth let out inhuman screams in a handful of different pitches.

  Mome Rath is from Jabberwocky, "And the mome raths outgrabe". But Juniper says they never made it into a game.

  > Raven nodded. “There’s an island where the trees grow,” she replied. She looked back down at the poem, then up at me. “What’s Mome Rath?”

  > “No idea,” I said. “It was on the list that Uther had your father read to me. It sounded familiar, but I don’t know if I was just thinking of the poem, or if it’s extrapolation from the other stuff, or whether I thought up something and then forgot it. So far as I know, it never made it into a game, so maybe it just never stuck. But it might be a novel creation of the Dungeon Master.” I shrugged. “I’m kind of curious how Arthur knew about it.”

  There are several [different depictions of them in media](https://aliceinwonderland.fandom.com/wiki/Mome_raths). Obviously none city sized, but interesting to speculate about.

  Interesting deconstruction of the soul-battle thing. Normally it's depicted as either a pure battle of wills or as what Gaiman called, "the oldest game" in *The Sandman*. Here in WtC it's frantically destroying braided energy creeping towards June a la Space Invaders.

  Also interesting to see just how much Lisi gets under the skin of the normally unflappable Amaryllis (and over the skin of Reimer, heh). I can't think of an interaction the Mary and Lisi had in this set of chapters where Mary didn't express some sort of frustration in the narration about it. She seems to react almost more emotionally to her than to Fallatehr trying to soul-rape her; although it has been a while since I read those chapters and might have glossed them in my memory.

    Guesswork/extrapolation: Lisi annoys her because she is a symbol/personification of the life she came from and who she could have become. Her whole lifetime of backstabbing and amorality, but worn in the open in a much less subtle way. Lisi is who Amaryllis might have become

  I was doing a bit of re-reading and came accross this in Junipers notes from chapter 105:

  > A Manxome Foe - Post-Arthur campaign, set in a decaying, dying world full of horrible things. A frightening number of exclusion zones come from this campaign, meaning that it’s one of the most visible parts of Aerb. Lots of names from Jabberwocky, mostly because that’s also where “vorpal” comes from. Lots of character deaths. Fel Seed. 

  So the Mome Rath is from the fucked up campaign that Fel Seed came from?
  ```

  - u/JusticeBeak:
    ```
    Maybe, maybe not. Since Mome Rath was first mentioned in the test that Uther designed to see if people were dream skewered, it would have to be something Uther knew about, which means it's probably not something from after Arthur died.

  Thanks for the chapter! I've been really looking forward to this. :)

  Three random thoughts:

  1) It *really* surprises me that they read Lisi and Reimer in so thoroughly. I was expecting them to recruit Lisi by saying something along the lines of "We run an island nation full of fish people with impossibly advanced technology, want to be on our good side Y/N", then have her pump Reimer on their behalf (I'm so sorry :) ). Being completely up-front with new, random assets who are not companions seems like a recipe for instant blowback.

  2) Is Bethel trying to two-time Ropey, or are Bethel and Ropey trying to rope (heh) Juniper into a threesome?

  3) I find it a little hard to believe that Amaryllis isn't aware that Juniper is head-over-heels for her. I know she's been shown to suck at interpersonal/selfish stuff before, but holy freaking crap- even the house and the bottle deer know that he's into her by this point.

    > 2) Is Bethel trying to two-time Ropey, or are Bethel and Ropey trying to rope (heh) Juniper into a threesome?

    I believe they are now one single entity; the "marriage" was pretty different from a typical mortal understanding of a "marriage" and Bethel isn't one part of a couple.
    ```

    - u/Sendatsu_Yoshimitsu:

        You know, I wouldn't be shocked if Ropey was in love with Juniper, however that translates to his ropelike manner, all this time and now RopeyBethel inhereted it.

        - u/GrafZeppelin127:

  Exciting chapters as always. Thoughts:

  - Seems like a lot of character development for Bethel. I wonder if Bethel's decision to help out at the end was driven by guilt over not being there to help when Fenn died and Amaryllis's talk about apologies not being enough. (Where she doesn't have a duty as a house, maybe she has a duty as a friend?)

  - For some reason I just found the Juniper/Sonee/Valencia scene super adorable, even though they were all just lying the whole time. I want a spin-off now where Valencia and Juniper are roommate-buddies at college.

  - If Juniper sees an exclusion zone occurring in person, it might strengthen his drive to solve the world's problems. (Especially if some of the people he's met get trapped in it.)

  New theory. Partially patternmatching on bad wordplay, partially on plot twists from Terry Pratchett's *Moving Pictures*. In that story, there was a magic sleeping person that the protagonists kept trying to prevent from awakening and it turned out that they were being actually counterproductive because the man awakening would act to restore order by stopping eldritch problems. His awakening was a response to solve the problem, not a symptom of problems and there was great dramatic irony when the reader realised the protagonists had ironically prevented a solution to their own problems.

  What if Harold is radically misunderstood - instead of causing or being drawn to crises, instead he is trying to *prevent* them, to stop them from arising or slow them when they escalate or limit the damage they can cause - which is why the incidents he precedes are always limited... Until now. To use a metaphor... there are two types of people you find running around near fires disproportionately often. One is an arsonist. **Harold could be a [fireman](https://macysthanksgiving.fandom.com/wiki/Harold)**. (no I don't think that link is indicative of anything - just amusing). I told you about the bad wordplay - the man made out of fire. Is a fire-man. A fireman. And juniper may have just killed the fireman in psychic combat.

    >“The End of This World,” answered Harold, staring at me. “The End of Suffering. The End of Pain. The End of Death. The End of Life.”

    >“How?” I asked.

    >“The Calling Forth of A World Lord,” Harold answered.

    He seems like more of an arsonist to me.

      Depends what a World Lord is. 

      The Herald Harold's definition of This World could be in terms of an epoch. A new world is an new age. The new World Lord would be the next savior, a new Uther.

      Remember the Library doesn't see Harold as a future extinction event and the major thing thats changed from that timeline is Joon coming back into play.

      I do also wonder if Harold is an echo of Uther.
      ```

      - u/sparkc:
        ```
        > Depends what a World Lord is

        Personally, my money is on the gigantic eldritch being summoned from an unnatural superstorm that was brought forth by chanting from those who Harold has control over.

        > definition of This World

        He also wants The End of Life, so you'd have to stretch that phrase to mean 'ascendance to a transcendent collective consciousness' or something if he's benevolent.
        ```

        - u/Se7enworlds:
          ```
          But wouldn't Joon and Uther more accurately fit the title World Lord more than something that, almost by definition was otherworldly?

          As for the second part, you're assuming that Harold is only describe parts of a whole want, rather than many different wants. It's deliberately vague so I'm not hanging my hat on it by any means, but Harold could mean that he wants the end of his own life in limbo, waiting as the Herald for the next World Lord - Joon. The world ending threats that never end the world Harold hangs around could instead be challenges meant to LVL UP Joon and push him to ascendancy as the next World Lord.

          All I'm saying really though is that there's definitely wiggle room for interpretation.

Too bad they don't have a steamship to ram into Mome Rath's head, which is the 'traditional' solution to this sort of problem (see Call of Cthulhu...). Maybe Bethel can arrange something? Or they can find a similarly large vehicle?

  The bursar being he'lesh and the bit about hallucinatory drugs - is that a Pratchett reference?

      Cyclamine is the name of her great-grandfather, who currently resides in the amulet. Note that he isn't *built* into it:

      >“It’s a copy of my great-grandfather,” said Amaryllis. “Wearing it allows the facsimile to converse with me. **I’m fairly certain that I could push my own essence into it**, which would clear him out and make the copy one in my own image, but I’m understandably reticent to do that.”

      The entad allows its owner to make a backup copy of his/her mind, Cyclamine is just the last person who did that. Amaryllis wasn't very fond of him, though; I'm speculating that she decided that having a backup/copy of herself is more useful than whatever utility Cyclamine offers (or fails to).

          Yeah, it wasn't pointed out within the text itself, but Joon has a bunch of virtues for unarmed, unarmored fighting, including:

          > Monkish Warrior: While unarmed and unarmored, you may parry attacks as though you held a weapon, dodge at twice your effective skill, and automatically re-roll injuries if they are in the lowest five percent of outcomes (you keep any lower rolls).

          > Hardened Skin: Lessens the toll that physical damage in combat takes on you. Slightly increases natural healing. Increases force required to break skin.

          > Parry 20, Prescient Blade: You take half the normal penalty to parry bullets, arrows, or other missile weapons. These attacks still do damage to your blade as normal.

          > Dodge 20, Thaumic Dodger: Eliminates the penalty for dodging magic, magical effects, entads, entad effects, and any supplemental physics which would appear magical to The Layman.

          > Unarmed Combat 10, Hardened Knuckles: Lessens the toll that unarmed combat takes on you. Does not actually increase the hardness of your knuckles as measured by indentation or scratch tests.

          > Six-Eyed: Any attempt to use any system in a non-standard way will be considered one degree more reasonable than it otherwise would be. Any existing virtues, entads, or effects that specify a degree of reasonableness are increased by one degree of reasonableness in your favor (calculated after all other effects).

    I noticed that as well. Was thinking that because he hasnt practiced it in combat before he didn't call on it instinctively in the same way as the other magic
    ```

    - u/morgf:
      ```
      But he did not have any other magic he could call on. Still magic was literally his only defense. And since he had nothing to do but think about still magic for quite a while, that should go a ways towards making up for lack of actual combat experience with it.
      ```

      - u/eaglejarl:
        ```
        It's easy to Monday-night quarterback, but the simplest and most simulationist answer is that Joon intellectually knows still magic but has not yet integrated it into his combat reflexes. He's had a lot of practice punching people and dodging things, and none using the brand new form of magic that he just learned. In an actually rational story, people are not perfectly rational at all times, nor do they instinctively think of the perfectly optimal answer.

        Personally, I would have been annoyed if he *had* used it.
        ```

        - u/JustLookingToHelp:
          ```
          He also may not have any particular techniques for still magic yet, having only practiced by acting on himself.  In the middle of life-or-death combat is not the opportune time to discover new techniques, especially with his normal multimage advantages nullified by the warding fields.
          ```

  - u/Trezzie:

    Alternatively, considering they're in a place with Still Magic, he instinctively assumed void weaponry, the counter to Still magic. But I don't recall that mentioned, and I noted the discrepancy as well.

    This comment has been edited in support of the protests against the upcoming Reddit API changes.

    Reddit's late announcement of the details API changes, the comically little time provided for developers to adjust to those changes and the handling of the matter afterwards (including the outright libel against the Apollo developer) has been very disappointing to me.

    Given their repeated bad faith behaviour, I do not have any confidence that they will deliver (or maintain!) on the few promises they have made regarding accessibility apps.

    I cannot support or continue to use such an organization and will be moving elsewhere (probably Lemmy).

      From the first paragraph of chapter 2:

      So he can see his level but he has to actually check.

    Given the lack of the normal signs of a level up, I have to conclude this is something else. What, though, is unclear. I suppose it's technically possible that it's something purely good, but I wouldn't bet on it.

      It might be benefits of meditation (he was just saying there is no point in meditating, then notices a buff and.totally misses it). Although I guess it will be clear when he looks at his level, sees a meditation skill, or a buff

    For a second I was hoping that Joon managed to kill Harold with the conatageous meme.

  Random thought through the read:

  * Valencia takes on HP seems clouded with Devil's point of view.
  * I think that most Bethel's action as of late is influenced by Ropey
  * Reimer is ... damn, Reimer-like if that's a word.
  * Using magic to solve poop problem... hmm.... why this sounds familiar (just kidding, lol)


  **The Burning Man**

  So the mystery so far:

  1. Murder in the temple: it's probably people who know the Burning Man existence when they meditated. But get killed in their way out because they haven't converted yet and know too much about it.
  2. There might be other people who also know but keep themselves silent. Don't know if this is a valid assumption.
  3. But if point 2 above true, this informant might tell this info to other group/people in secret, afraid of getting detected by the burning man.
  4. The ethic instructor, Malus Lartin, might know this information too from other mouth, hence she refuse June's help worrying if that was a trap from the Burning Man, or telling them in the prison might leak the information to the Burning Man.
  5. The group that know the burning man existence might also the one who saved her at the Demon-Blooded Festival

  Huh, there's been a conspicuous spike in 3rd person omniscient narration for the non-Joon characters in the last dozen or so chapters. It's really nice to get into the heads of the companions because I have the feeling we'll never see these sides of them if left to Joon's own devices and AW's narrative constraints on fitting in all the Joon-on-1 interaction combinations. However, like usual, fancy theory time! Besides the expository convenience, the increasing frequency in these short vignettes seems to coincide with Joon's own determination to be more empathetic to his companions (Pallida is an outlier here, wonder why) and, inversely, with a eerie reduction in the Earth DND vignettes. I'm guessing pronpinquity's at work again. But it also feels weird, because Joon is *not* part of these interactions and he can't possibly know about them unless they recount it to him (IIRC the first secondary POV was Mary's during the Fallatehr arc and that was a recounting). Doesn't seem to be the case here, with how personal these episodes feel. And if we go full meta, the story's a self-insert - where's the meta-knowledge coming from, DM?!

  I was surprised by the line that there's only 200 different species. It feels like Joon has mentioned or seen several dozen of those already, just by going to a few major cities or from asides, and Aerb is *ten times* larger than Earth is. That seems like a really low number, or at least a really high rate of co-mingling.
  ```

  - u/nytelios:
    ```
    > “During the reign of Uther Penndraig, five hundred years ago, the hexal population was twenty billion,” said Amaryllis. “Today it’s five billion.”

    Population density is a helluva lot lower in Aerb. If Earth pop is ~7 billion, napkin math shows that Earth is ~14x as dense in population (even more if the land:water ratio is higher on Aerb). Urbanization also means the majority of people will concentrate in the cities and co-mingle for convenience.
