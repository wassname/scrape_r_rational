## [Biweekly Challenge] New Age

### Post:

## Last Time

[Last time,](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/430hg8/biweekly_challenge_star_wars/?sort=confidence) the prompt was "Star Wars". /u/cthulhuraejepsen is the winner with their story [The Will of the Force](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/430hg8/biweekly_challenge_star_wars/czgkwyv). Congratulations /u/cthulhuraejepsen, that makes your third win!

##### This Time

Next time, the challenge will be "New Age". Homeopathy, crystal healing, astrological signs, tarot readings, palm readings, spiritualism, etc. The term isn't a well-defined one, nor is it that easy to separate from its historical antecedants, but it's just a prompt; go cruising some new age websites ([or Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_New_Age_topics)) and see what stories spring to mind. Remember, prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

The winner will be decided **Wednesday, February 24th.** You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

##### Meta

If you think you have a good prompt for a challenge, [add it to the list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B6HaZc8FYkr6l6Q4cwBc9_-Yq1g0f_HmdHK5L1tbEbA/edit?usp=sharing) (remember that [a good prompt is not a recipe](http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/prompts?src=RECIPE)). Also, if you want a quick index of past challenges, I've [posted them on the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/weeklychallenge).

##### Next Time

Next time, the challenge will be "First Contact". My first thought when I hear that phrase is *alien* contact, but there's no reason that you couldn't do contact between pre-Industrial civilizations on the same planet, contact between parallel worlds, or contact between the past and future.

**Next challenge's thread will go up on 2/24.** Please private message me with any questions or comments, as the beloved meta thread is now archived. The companion thread for recommendations and discussion [can be found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/459yn9/challenge_companion_new_age/).

  [Nuclear Rapture](http://pastebin.com/0mczqtQr), 1800 words, a rational new age chiliasm/reincarnation fic about what might happen if Edgar Cayce's channelings on where souls and consciousness came from were true. (And, I guess, looking over the encyclopedia, if the Platonic doctrine of recollection were true. Didn't realize Cayce had been borrowing from such an august source.)

    Haha, the ending is a perfect "wait, shit" moment.

    Intriguing.

    [Thoughts at the end (1):  ](#s "Since a human can speak of having qualia, if the 'spark' could be taken away while the brain lived then would or would not the brain still speak of having qualia?  If not, then maybe we could view the sparks as ourselves, whereas if so then we might view the sparks as parasites (though having done us some good for a time), whereas they would view us as philosophical zombies.")

    [Thoughts at the end (2):  ](#s "I found myself bothered by the question of numbers.  If fission happens rarely, then by the time that all are safely in humans (with the population still slowly increasing) is there already an 'epidemic' of mindless humans born?  Since so many died, especially at the beginning when there were only a few weak guides, were there billions upon billions of sparks at the start in many different animal species before shrinking to the current human population by the time that the story is set in?")

    [Thoughts at the end (3):  ](#s "(I'm assuming that suspension of disbelief requires ignoring the question of why the sparks didn't notice the trapped-and-doomed nature of entering animals after more than a few tried it and before enough of them (amongst billions of them?) tried it to be unable to maintain the gate, or why more didn't come through when the gate stopped being maintained from the other side.)")

  [Inconveniences](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17AMUJayxNM82ONn3YkTpw1FygvAyvIwHuRMgkPefSrs/edit?usp=sharing), 1050 words, in which we are reminded that healers can be assholes too.

  Not super deep into the New Age stuff, but it was fun to write. I'm not used to writing bad guys who don't have geopolitical agendas.

    Is the healer really an asshole here, though? I don't know if I misinterpreted it, but it seems as if he's only doing what he can to protect himself, as opposed to just dicking over people at random. He needs to blend in with the frauds so he doesn't become a government tool, right?
    ```

    - u/Rhamni:
      ```
      Nah, you got that right. Leaving the girl to die was rational given that he didn't want to be snatched up by Uncle Sam. What I also tried to show though was that he didn't *care* that the girl would die. He considered the father an 'easy mark' to bleed dry, and at the end he thinks to himself that *he* doesn't care, and is just annoyed he loses out on the money and word of mouth.
      ```

      - u/MultipartiteMind:
        ```
        <nods>  I'm put in mind of how, in practice, doctors and nurses tend to develop empathy exhaustion--enough suffering and dying people seen that they become unable to care about suffering and death any more, but keep at it lessening suffering and death where they can because they know in their heads it's the right things to do (or just for money, depending on the person).  Still better than someone who increases suffering and death while feeling guilty about it!

    ```
    Could make for a good short story or novella.
    ```

    - u/Rhamni:
      ```
      Thanks! I made the characters up as I wrote, but they do fit in as is in another book I'll never write.
      ```
