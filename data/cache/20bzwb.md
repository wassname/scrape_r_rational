  In case you want to read a rational based Death Note. Updates once in a blue moon.

  Man, what the hell is up with the CSS on that page? It bombs out on both IE and Chrome, and the text fades from red to blue in an entirely too distracting way. Blegh.

  I do have a more relevant complaint:

  > So, Lightâ€™s fundamental mistake is to kill in ways unrelated to his goal. Killing through heart attacks does not just make him visible early on, but the deaths reveals that his assassination method is supernaturally precise. L has been tipped off that Kira exists. First mistake.

  Unless it's been too long since I watched the anime, Light wanted his activities known, because part of his intent was to curtail future killings - which wouldn't have happened if no one knew that someone was out there killing the killers. And in fact, the anime makes a point to show that crime rates drop because people know about Kira. This wasn't a mistake, it was a calculated part of the plan (albeit spurred on by hubris and perhaps not that wise in regards to actually achieving his goal).

  I felt the same way about Light. He was hasty and decided to kill Lind L Taylor in an act of spite against what L was forcing him to say. So unlike something you'd think a top student would do. While it's true that Light couldn't predict the unknown unknowns (L), he should've  at least not reacted to L challenging him on TV.
  Then again, hindsight bias.

    I'm not sure you could call it hindsight bias: that's when knowledge of the outcome influences one's judgment of probability of earlier events. But one of the interesting things there was that I hadn't realized it was such a big mistake until I was writing the essay and was running the numbers - I had expected one of the later mistakes to be bigger, and was fairly surprised that the apparently harmless Lind mistake was such a serious one. Once you put the relevant population numbers in, it was pretty unmistakable.

      Are you mixing up the mistakes now? In your article, you write that killing Lind only ruled out ~2/3rds of the japanese population, so he was giving up 1.6 bits of anonymity.

      The scheduling giveaway and the revelation that he has access to confidential police data were his biggest mistakes. (At least according to your essay.)
      ```

        Possibly. It's been a long time since I wrote it.
