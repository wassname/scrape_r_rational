## [BST][Q][HSF] How to parley a simple superpower into temporal communication?

### Post:

tl;dr:  How do you take a pile of perfectly rigid objects and use them to build a machine that will send messages through time?

*EDIT:  Stripped out a lot of what the power could do based on the discussion below.  Thanks, guys!  You not only saved me from having to deal with temporal signalling, but closed off the majority of abuses, which will make the power more interesting.*

I'm currently working on a novel called "Induction", which is the third piece in my Change Storms series.  This series is like Worm in that it explores the question "what if superpowers were real?"  It is different from Worm in that I'm working forward, not backward; as a result, no one wears spandex and no one has [](#s "an alien in their  head") making them carry idiot and conflict balls.

Elly Larkin, the protagonist, has the power to straighten threads, and I would like the wisdom of Reddit to see if this can be parleyed into temporal communication.  [EDIT:  I'm hoping the answer is "no, it can't"!] Specifically, her powers:

* Affect only ~~things~~ threads made of plant fibers (cotton, linen, hemp...) *(By 'threads' I mean strands below a certain diameter.)*
* ~~Affect only thread-like and woven-from-thread things.  Thread, yarn, string, rope, gauze, cloth, etc.~~
* Threads ~~Linear elements (threads etc)~~ become perfectly straight.  The fibers do not unweave.
* ~~A cloth swatch becomes perfectly flat.~~
* ~~Cloth that's been stitched into a closed form (e.g. a sock or shirt) using straightenable fibers inflates into that form.  In other words, your T-shirt suddenly looks like it's been stretched tight over a mannequin.~~
* Things that have been straightened are absolutely invulnerable.  Cannot be bent, broken, burned, or deformed in any way.
* She has a range of about 50 feet.
* Things stay straight as long as she concentrates on them.
* If she wants, she can mentally 'squeeze' them so that they will stay straight when she stops concentrating.  
* If she squeezes as hard as possible they'll stay straight for about 10 minutes; she can do shorter time frames, but she can't hit an exact duration anymore than a normal person can hit an exact number of newtons when physically squeezing something.  
* It takes a finite but extremely small amount of time for an object to go from normal to straightened. She can slow it down if she wants, so that it takes up to 1 second.  She cannot straighten part of something, nor maintain straightness of part of something.
* Probably not relevant, but any straightened object that hits her with a force above a certain threshold will bounce off.  Specifically, the direction component of its velocity will be instantly flipped 180 degrees.  This is a Required Secondary Power intended to keep her from getting hurt if she straightens something too near her body and it slams into her.


The "can't be deformed" part is interesting.  Given a perfectly rigid object, you can send an FTL signal by moving the object -- when the person at point A moves the rod, the person at point B would see it move before the light arrived from point A.  Light takes 50 nanoseconds to travel 50', but in theory you could have one straightened fiber cause another to move, thereby getting you an extra 50 ns.

I'm trying to picture a machine that could be built under these constraints that would send a signal back a useful amount of time.  Any thoughts?

Hopefully boring legal bit:

When I gave 2YE away before publishing it, this was an issue for some people, so let me be clear:  This novel is for publication.  My plan is to post each chapter for free as I write it and, when it's done, I'll put it all together, do final edits, and publish the novel.  My Patreon backers will get each chapter (and the final novel) in multiple ebook/pdf formats.  The final book will almost certainly be posted to Amazon, although it may go to other services as well.  Once it's published it may or may not cease to be available online, depending on the TOS of the places I publish it.  All of this is my current plan, but it could change.  Finally -- and I apologize for saying this because it sounds rude,  but I feel that it's necessary:  when I gave 2YE away before publishing it, it became clear that at least a few people on the board don't understand how copyright works:  copyright belongs to the person who writes the book, not to people who help with brainstorming.  Helping me brainstorm this will get you my gratitude and maybe a reference on the 'thank you' page in the book, but it won't get you legal or moral rights in what I do with the book.

      Straightness isn't really a thing, though. Even a photon travelling through vacuum will curve in deformed space time. That implies that straightened objects are somehow straight as applied to an absolute reference frame, or that they've been imbued with absolute conceptual straightness that bypasses physics.
      ```

      - u/Charlie___:
        ```
        There is absolutely a notion of straightness in GR - look up "parallel transport." The catch is that it's entirely local - a photon travels in straight line locally, but from a faraway perspective this can have curvelike properties (e.g. two straight paths can intersect more than once. Non-euclidean!).

  Threads have an infinite speed of sound? Alright. I'll go with the standard ladder "paradox", which I prefer to conceptualize as a train going through a train-length tunnel with doors on both ends. When the train is in the tunnel, Elly, standing in the middle with threads going both ways, closes and reopens both doors at the same time. The train is going so fast that it is length contracted, so it fits in the tunnel and everything is fine.

  From the train's perspective, the tunnel is contracted, and the train *doesn't* fit. If the doors closed at the same time in this reference frame, the train will get damaged, and two reference frames can't disagree on whether that's happened! So, the train sees the front door close and reopen when it gets to it, then it passes through the tunnel, then the back door closes and reopens later. The conductor and Elly disagree on whether the doors were simultaneous, but they agree on all other observations.

  Clever Elly ties a thread to the train. Using a hook or something, the train uses this thread to close the back door as soon as it sees the front door close in front of it. Since the train sees the tunnel as shorter than itself, this damages the caboose.

  From Elly's perspective, the train (which does fit in the tunnel) is coming, then before it is completely inside, the back door damages it, pulling on her thread to the back door. She was going to wait for the train to be completely inside, so she receives this pull before she sends the pull to close the front door that the train is responding to.

  How far back she can send a signal is limited only to how far she can munchkin her threads to go (maximum of 20 lightminutes if she doesn't affect a single thread beyond her range, arbitrarily far if she does) and how fast she can get them moving.
  ```

  - u/eaglejarl:
    ```
    So, if she can arrange for a relativistic vehicle then maybe she could make this work, but under normal circumstances not.  Okay, good.

     > How far back she can send a signal is limited only to how far she can munchkin her threads to go (maximum of 20 lightminutes if she doesn't affect a single thread beyond her range, arbitrarily far if she does) 

    I think you skipped a step, because I'm not following -- how are you getting 20 lightminutes?
    ```

    - u/Anakiri:
      ```
      Even very slight causality violations can be daisy chained. Though quick back-of-the-envelope calculations say you're safe... A bullet going at 1200 m/s over 30 meters can send a signal back 4*10^(-13) seconds. Even if you made a big square of 8100 guns, that's still just a few nanoseconds. Elly would have to munchkin up another ten orders of magnitude to make it really useful. So she's at least not going to break Time in a weekend.

      The 20 lightminute figure probably comes from misreading the rules. If she squeezes an object so she doesn't have to concentrate on it, and it leaves her range, does the effect still hold? If so, she can throw out the ends of a thread to get up to that far. But on rereading, I think that's not what you intended.
      ```

- u/capsless:
  ```
  if you're looking for a method for causality-breaking that relies on superluminal communication, you're looking for the [tachyonic antitelephone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tachyonic_antitelephone). the difficulty is in the processing of messages within the small timeframe granted by the 100 foot (why are you measuring things in feet) diameter of the power, but modern processors have clock rates fast enough to perform many operations in that gap (and of course, so long as you're gaining some amount of time, you can iterate to go back to the initialization of the device). you would probably need to make many such devices run in parallel to avoid the extra time taken by serial processing.

  that said... the premise doesn't imply the conclusion at all? """perfectly rigid""" doesn't make things somehow move faster than light.

    > why are you measuring things in feet

    The story is set in the USA, and most people who purchase books from Amazon, B&N, etc are from the USA.  (This is per my actual purchase records.)

    I actually thought about moving to metric because it would be much less of a pain, but it wouldn't be accurate to the setting.

      only if you happen to assume some sort of objective reference frame? like, every particle in the object is always in line, *from their own individual points of view*. there is no sense by which you can say, "oh, well, these things are simultaneous *even though they appear to happen at different times to literally every possible observer*". you're imposing concepts from classical mechanics on a relativistic universe and expecting the resulting model to be consistent.

      see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_of_simultaneity
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        This is what I was trying to communicate earlier. You can't say that something is perfectly straight and rigid when any possible observer would see it bending.
        ```

- u/ArgentStonecutter:
  ```
  I thought about this issue when reading Vinge's _Bobble_ series. If time stops in the bobble, the bobble is perfectly rigid. A bobble, or a chain of bobbles, could be used to send a message faster than light.

  Or, if they're not perfectly rigid, then you can create an upper bound to how slow time passes inside the bobble.

  In the process of trying to figure that out, I thought about time travel. The problem, I thought, is that to get time travel out of FTL signalling you need to be able to send the signals from an object traveling at a significant velocity with respect to the receiver. This practically rules out signalling through rigid bodies.

  It depends on what reference frame "can't be deformed" is declared in. If it's in some privileged reference frame, e.g. Elly's, no information can travel backwards in Elly's time.

  If it's the wire's own reference frame, I think I have one:

  Take two sets of electrically charged, fortified pieces of fiber string. Send them in opposite directions through a synchrotron at relativistic velocities, keeping the distance between fibers less than the length of the fibers.

  If you push one fiber at the front, it'll move instantaneously according to its own reference frame at the back, which is slightly in the laboratory frame's past. Use a ridiculously fast mechanism to push the front side of a fiber moving in the opposite direction iff the backside of an earlier fiber is pushed. This pushes the back of the fiber, further in the laboratory frame's past. Use the same mechanism on that end to push the previous fiber, and you can send back messages arbitrarily far with as much data as the resolution of the mechanism.

  So setting it to Elly's frame is probably best. And not that atrocious, since the effect does have a distance limit.

  Further thoughts:

  A line can be declared straight if it follows the trajectory of a photon.

  How are knots or braids resolved?

  When is a bundle of fibers declared a single, larger rope?

  how strong are the forces applied in straightening? Can it cut through water? Syrup? Custard? Fat? Muscle? Bone? Wood? Steel? ...

    I'm having trouble envisioning exactly how the mechanism you're describing would work, but I totally agree -- setting it to Elly's frame (a) makes sense and (b) gets me out of having to deal with time travel messages, which I really did *not* want to deal with.  

    > A line can be declared straight if it follows the trajectory of a photon.

    Makes sense.  I'm not sure if it will become relevant, but that's the definition I'll use.  Thank you.

    > How are knots or braids resolved?

    Gnimhey asked about this below and I saw his/her post first, so I [answered there.](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3hzec0/bstqhsf_how_to_parley_a_simple_superpower_into/cuc9gbh)  Short answer is that the knot is pulled ultratight.

    > When is a bundle of fibers declared a single, larger rope?

    Look!  Shiny object!

    > how strong are the forces applied in straightening? 

    Very.

    > Can it cut through water? Syrup? Custard? Fat? Muscle? Bone? Wood? Steel? ...

    Yes.

  So, if she has a giant coil of thread a few miles long and uses her power on it, does it all go straight or does only the section in her radius after it's done spronging outwards go straight? If it's a thin enough thread, and she can control the orientation, boom, instant space elevator. This is FTL communication, even significant if the thread is on a planetary scale. Conventional stuff might have a problem, but if there are the equivalent of Tinkers in the setting that can create coherent nanothreads, then she could send a message to Mars in a second subjectively.

  On the other hand, why aren't the threads subject to time dilation and length contraction?

    Erm.  Have to admit, I hadn't thought of that possibility -- I've been working with ordinary-sized objects that she was holding or standing next to.  Let me get back to you on that.  (If you have thoughts about the implications either way, I'd be grateful to hear them.)

    > On the other hand, why aren't the threads subject to time dilation and length contraction?

    That...is a good question.  They would be.  Which I think puts paid to the whole "signal back in time" thing.

    Good.  Honestly, I didn't want to have to deal with temporal messaging, I just felt that it needed to be addressed if it were possible; it's a rationalist story, and I would expect the people in it to munchkin the hell out of their powers.  If they have a chance to mess with time, they will.
    ```

    - u/ArgentStonecutter:

      Time dilation and length contraction are not issues because no part of the object has to move at relativistic speeds to send a message through it.

  If I were Elly, the first thing I'd do would be to either learn how to sew or hire a tailor and create versions of just about any object I might need that unfold into the object when straightened. She could even have something like an inflatable gun - the plush barrel, and a separate cord wound tightly around a core, with a bullet as well. Inflate the gun, aim, inflate the cord, and the only place the sudden line can go is out, propelling the bullet ahead of it. It's basically an obscenely overpowered spring gun, and anything that can fit in the barrel can be used.

  Actually, she could probably impale just about anything by shooting a thread at it. Because rigid objects can't cut her, or indeed hurt her at all, she could perfectly easily climb up a micron-thick thread hand over hand.

  Also, does the force reversal thing work reciprocally? Because if so, she can treat a rigid cloth table as a trampoline with perfect efficiency, bouncing upwards.

    That is a ridiculously cool idea; thank you.  What name would you like listed on the acknowledgements page?

    > Also, does the force reversal thing work reciprocally? Because if so, she can treat a rigid cloth table as a trampoline with perfect efficiency, bouncing upwards.

    Yes, but she's only protected against the direct force of the object.  She'd still suffer g-force effects from that bounce.

  Would this not provide her with a sort invincibility? All she has to do is wear a full coverage, skintight outfit and extend her power over it. If she gets shot, or hit in any significant way her suit would immediately 'hit her" and bounce back. I don't know if it would sort of vibrate as it moves back and forth from the point of impact, "hitting" the user and bouncing back repeatedly.
  ```

  I would suggest you change the power's definition of perfectly rigid to eliminate FTL effects. When you push one end of a straightened rope rod, the other end moves a speed-of-light delay later. With relativistic effects, it's not your rope that bends, it's space. Your rope is still straight within that space. So there are ways around your character's power. Vista can play with your toys.
  ```

- u/Geminii27:
  ```
  I can see how you'd get FTL out of it, but I'm not sure about time travel. While the two tend to be casually linked in popular culture, being able to travel FTL doesn't necessarily mean you'd be able to send a message from A to B back to A and have it arrive before it was sent.

  I'd also want to see how the 'perfectly straight' designation applied to deformed space, because straightness depends on what framework you're measuring it by.

  For example, one current thought about the universe is that it's spherical (with a twist) in four spacial dimensions, meaning that there is a finite volume but no edge (similar to how the Earth has a finite surface area but you can't fall off the edge of the world). Would a straightened object of sufficient length start to disappear from the universe the way it would appear to lift away from the Earth's surface (which is curved)? Or would it conform to the spacetime curve of the universe, appearing absolutely straight at any non-interplanetary lengths but being able to be bent by supermassive objects in the same way as light (ie the thread would always remain parallel to a laser beam, even if the beam got bent around a star or black hole - both would remain *optically* straight and straight according to local spacetime)?

  I'd recommend using "straight according to spacetime", as it allows objects to appear perfectly straight at all normal day-to-day lengths while breaking far fewer physical laws.

  (Note that this would probably mean it was only perfectly rigid within a lightspeed cone, too - so no FTL messaging, although lightspeed messaging is pretty good for daily superpower use.)
