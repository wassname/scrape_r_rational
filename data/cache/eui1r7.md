## MoL Fan-Made Ending: The Contingency

### Post:

In his mind, Zorian *cackled*. He would have cackled out loud, if he had the capacity to do so. But you see, Zorian was, at the moment, lacking a body that had the organs typically employed for cackling. For that matter, he was lacking anything that even remotely resembled a human body. He could, however, trivially produce a cackling sound virtually anywhere on the planet by now, but he was far too busy with other matters. And thus, he only cackled in his mind in a thousand voices.

It all started when his final contingency was activated upon the destruction of his last simulacrum. As it turns out, time dilation chambers become much, much simpler to implement if you only apply said dilation to a pure mind. There is not much matter to be accelerated, after all. Zorian’s hastily-made pocket dimension contained an ectoplasmic shell to house the mind and a moderate amount of crystallized mana to fuel its operations.

By the time Zach let out a scream of pure, unadulterated, rage after seeing Zorian die, over a hundred of copies of Zorian’s mind have come online, scattered all over the continent, and some of them beyond. It took them mere fractions of a second to sift through the numerous perspectives of the preceding battle, analyzing.

By the time Zach let lose the first spell in his retaliation at Quatach-Ichl, the first synchronization of Zorian’s massively accelerated sub-minds was complete. The individual sub-minds were then immediately sped up again, each with their own task. Even though each of them was working independently, cut off from the rest by dimensional boundaries, their near-perfect planning allowed for extremely efficient collaboration, with almost no double work being performed. They broke out of time dilation at regular intervals, coordinating almost instantly using the soul link.

By the time Zach’s first spell made impact on Quatach-Ichl’s shields, Zorian’s activities already bore the first fruits. First, for the last few iterations, all of the sub-minds were running with revised schematics, more than doubling the time dilation factor given the same amount of mana. Second, a small swarm of simple ectoplasmic constructs were scouring some remote, yet promising, parts of the Dungeon for easily accessible crystallized mana. It was then promptly transported, via tiny dimensional gates, to fuel short-term operations of Zorian’s temporally accelerated sub-minds. But most importantly, Zorian now had over a dozen of new plausible theories of magic, all of them compatible with Zorian’s unprecedentedly close-up observations of how the angel-summoning device worked.

By the time Quatach-Ichl got an opening to counterattack, Zorian has performed hundreds of thousands of minuscule experiments, probing the laws of magic at the very fundamental levels. While the overwhelming majority of them failed to produce any interesting outcomes, Zorian believed he was very close to cracking the secret of safely using ambient mana. It was his utmost priority at the moment. Even though his self-improvements have progressed in leaps and bounds, yielding more than a hundred-fold gain in mana efficiency for his sub-minds, the crystallized mana was harder and harder to come by. This, in turn, severely limited his growth. If he made no breakthrough soon, he would have to slow down. It was a bad option, given what was happening in Cyoria at the moment.

Zach was on the defensive and almost out of mana when all of a sudden, a projectile slammed into Quatach-Ichl, completely bypassing his shields and lodging itself into his rib cage. Not missing a beat, the ancient lich took it out and launched it straight at Zach, who easily sidestepped it, deftly avoiding a dead body on the ground. He swallowed a lump in his throat. So many dead. Useless. It has all been for naught. Dead bodies everywhere. So many of his comrades, his friends, fallen. A whole graveyard of Eldemar soldiers right underneath his feet, all taken out by the demons. Out of a corner of his eye, he noticed the bodies start to move. The lich was not attacking, his attention apparently fixed on the corpses.

Damn this old bag of bones, he is doing necromancy! Alanic was dead, and Zach never really learned the trick of snuffing these puppets out, so he scrambled to get out of the way. Sharpened bones started sliding right out of the dead bodies, rising into the air. Was the lich making a bone golem? The next moment, the projectiles launched straight at Quatach-Ichl, some gleaming with a golden light. The lich accelerated himself, evading. But there were far too many, so one of the projectiles hit him right on. The lich collapsed into a lifeless heap of bones on the spot.

Zach could swear he heard someone cackle for a moment, before another, much stronger voice rumbled from above:

**“No! The triggers! Stop!”**

The air filled with cracks, seemingly coming from all the directions at once, reality itself ripping apart. Bright light started coming down from the angels, trying to contain it.

But it was too little, too late.

  Super fun, but I don't understand what happened at the end, there.

    there was a mention in the some early chapter that the gods placed triggers in the world to prevent and stop various things from happening, considering the one we know of are the access of primordial into the main reality we can assume most of them are to prevent an extinction threat or otherwise world changing/destroying event, the angel mention that the triggers the gods place most likely had scorched earth policy in that regard, which is dangerous to all of the world.

    what the fic imply that Hive!zorian manage to become so powerful and out of the norm that he most likely activated one of the triggers with his mind!link or various experiments.

    when the only other known trigger is a primordial summoning, something that hadn't happen yet to the best of our knowledge, we can assume that what zorian did was either very dangerous to require a trigger or the gods deemed it so unwanted it was worth a good portion of reality to get rid of it.

    the angel are partly in charge to make sure the triggers won't activate,and might consider it even worse then pantexh escaping.

    from chapter 96, the end of the discussion with the angel.

      Yeah, this is what I was referring to. Some plausible triggers are:

      * A recursively self-improving agent going FOOM
      * Using ambient mana in weird ways all over the planet
      * Using magic without using a soul at massive scales
      * Exponentially growing networks of tiny dimensional passages

      These are the things that an unleashed primordial would likely do as well.

        My guess would be a mind containing an accurate model of the nature of magic/reality. Such a mind would basically be a god anyway, and could probably break out of the box it found itself in.
