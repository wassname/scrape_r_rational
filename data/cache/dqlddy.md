## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  I've been working on an entropy-defying magic system that I would be interested in seeing Munchkined:

  Roughly speaking, the concept is that if you perform an appropriate ritual, you can "recover" the negentropy that gets used in some area, and then later release it to achieve what you want. Some examples:

  If you collect the negentropy from burning some wood, then if you later encounter something wooden that has burned or is burning, you can "unburn" it using your negentropy, which will partially restore it. Any details in the wood that cannot be inferred from the remainder are, however, going to appear from the wood you collected the negentropy from, and not the wood you spent the negentropy on; as you can only restore the negentropy that you collected. (Such details may include wood microstructure, which you maybe don't care about, but perhaps also carved text, which you very well may care about.)

  Another example: if you hit a wall with a branch, the kinetic energy is going to dissipate into the wall as heat. If you collect the negentropy from this, you can later go to a different surface, and reverse the entropy to make this surface suddenly send out a burst of kinetic energy equivalent to what you initially hit the wall with. Note that this is not storing the energy, but rather, you extract the energy from the heat of the wall. (Similarly, in the unburning example, you would be extracting the energy from the heat of the air around you.)

  Third example. Now we get to the "dark magic side": If you wound a person, you can store up the negentropy that this wounding used, and use this to later heal similar wounds. Note that this will not always work; for instance, if someone has received a brain injury, then using this magic to restore the brain would restore brain from the person you wounded, and not the person you're healing, as this is the person you collected the entropy from.

  To define the rules more formally: If you do some ritual (haven't decided what yet, but it's probably going to be relatively elaborate and immobile for balance reasons), you can "store up the negentropy that's used" in an area (haven't yet decided what it's going to be stored in, probably some crystals with negentropy capacity proportional to their volume). Later, if you encounter some situation whose starting state is similar to the end state of the ritual, you can use the negentropy to "reverse it", with physically-possible but thermodynamically-impossible interactions happening until the end state of the situation is similar to the starting state of the ritual.

  I haven't yet decided on all details yet (e.g. range, difficulty of doing the various things in question, etc.), because I haven't yet been able to figure out how extreme things this system allows, and so how much balancing is needed. I'd be curious about how much you can Munchkin it under various levels of restrictions; so feel free to try out relatively low or relatively high restrictions compared to what I described, depending on what you'd find most interesting.

    About your branch example, for a lot of impacts the kinetic energy will dissipate through loss of potential energy from the objects deforming. Would you be able to harness that negentropy as well? For that you can build up a stock of "physical deformation repair" negentropy for a given material, which you can then use to do things like repair armor/weapons in the middle of a fight, or for more mundane examples perform proactive maintenance of structures through infusions of repair energy.

    For the wood example, do you still need all the products of the reaction (ashes, smoke??) to reverse it, or is matter created ex nihilo from the template of source negentropy? If so, there probably needs to be some kind strict definition on what chemical reactions can be used to extract negentropy from, or you'll have to deal with the knock-on affects of harvesting negentropy through creating solvents of rare earth metals (which can then be precipitated out and reused) to create more of the same out of nothing.

      >Would you be able to harness that negentropy as well? 

      Yes. I don't think the specific examples you mentions seem particularly broken/Munchkin-ish (ability to magically repair things is a pretty standard magical thing, no?), though, but I wonder if one could figure out some broken things based on it.

      > For the wood example, do you still need all the products of the reaction (ashes, smoke??) to reverse it, or is matter created ex nihilo from the template of source negentropy?

      If one was to be physically strict, one would need *everything* to be present in a nice way. However, such strictness would probably not make for a very interesting magic system, so one will have to take some creative liberties and allow some things that "feel like" they should be allowed, even if in a very strict physical sense they shouldn't be.

      I'm not as informed about how combustion works as I should be. As a result, I don't know what the smoke and ashes correspond to in terms of the initial wood, and I don't know what happens to wood smoke in the atmosphere (does the atmosphere contain the same chemicals as wood smoke, just dispersed more evenly?). This makes it hard for me to know how big of a creative liberty it would be to allow "unburning" without having smoke or ashes present.

      (Part of the smoke is presumably the carbon, which is a pretty central part of the wood. But this carbon will also be present in the atmosphere normally, no? So at least this element would not need preexisting smoke to unburn.)

      For the specific case of "unburning", I don't think it makes much of a difference, though, as you need *a lot* of heat to do the unburning, which likely means having a fire next to it to generate said heat. This fire could then provide the smoke and ashes needed too. (Hmm, and I guess it could also provide the negentropy, though as mentioned I'd make this system require elaborate rituals to extract the negentropy, so it may be more practical to have it pre-collected.)

      > If so, there probably needs to be some kind strict definition on what chemical reactions can be used to extract negentropy from, or you'll have to deal with the knock-on affects of harvesting negentropy through creating solvents of rare earth metals (which can then be precipitated out and reused) to create more of the same out of nothing. 

      While trying to work out how to handle this might be interesting, I think I would handle it by taking the creative liberty of just handwaving it away; pretending that the rare metals don't exist or aren't necessary, rather than figuring out a system that avoid exploitation. It'd probably be very difficult to create a magic system that doesn't break when one does very careful exploits in terms of marginal increases and decreases of minerals, energy, etc. that happen as a result of the magic.

      (Though I am still interested in hearing ways and ideas for how such marginal increases could be exploited, so I can be prepared about them when thinking about how to develop the magic system.)

    On reversing brain damage...

    A sufficiently motivated person could ritually destroy someone's brain to save up their whole self. Then, they could find a brain dead body and return the person they killed to life. Possible applications of this include:

    * Curing dysphoria? (Big maybe, might just replace gender dysphoria with total body dysmorphia)

    * Torturing an enemy by dropping them into an incompatable body.

    * Faking your own death by actually killing yourself, then coming back.

    * Escaping from a dying body into a living one.

    * Compressing a bunch of people into one person for the purposes of evacuation or other situations where limited numbers of "real" people can survive.

    * Turning the bodies of dying enemy soldiers into vessels for your own soldiers who almost died.

    * Super wierd, lossy immortality for the rich and sufficiently innurred to dysphoria.

    I imagine a world where this is possible wouldn't have a traditional death penalty, as replacing the condemned with more valuable resurrection targets would be strictly correct. The punishment for attempted murder which left the victim recoverable could involve being replaced by your victim.
