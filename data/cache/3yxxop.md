## [FF] With This Ring moving threads

### Post:

For anyone that only follows the story only posts, you may have missed this.

Essentially, the author got into a brief discussion about Star Wars and included minor details of the setting of the story (note: zero plot elements or anything that could give away the suspense of the film). Because of this and the rules imposed on Space Battles for the opening of Star Wars, he was banned for a single day from posting.  By his own admission, Mr Zoat (the author) became irrationally angry at this and decided to move his thread over to Sufficient Velocity. When he becomes unbanned later today, he has stated that he will permanently lock the current threads on Space Battles and begin migrating content to Sufficient Velocity.

Page of the thread where the conflict started, although the original posts have been removed: https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-thread-eleven.311139/page-2109

Edit: to give an example of how bad the spoiler policy is, they just banned someone for mentioning that the Millennium Falcon is in the movie. When it's in the trailer and on the official poster. Yeah.

  I’ve visited SpaceBattles a few times recently because TVTropes recommendations pointed to some stories there, but the atmosphere felt really weird. 

  A moderator could show up to give a warning for a really stupid reason, for instance, write a wall of text with lots of spelling mistakes and plain out bad formatting, and everybody just rolled with it like they were used to it and that was supposed to be normal.

  The discussion rules set in the [tGWP](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/RyuugisTheGamesWePlay) thread were outright stiffening; after the Star Wars hype *all* the pages\threads acquired an advertising for the SW discussion thread; etc; etc.

  I’m kinda biased in judging a classic bulletin-board forum because they’ve always felt too restrictive to me, but still.

    I recently [spoke in defense](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3vf7x8/d_friday_offtopic_thread/cxniksw) of aggressive moderation for bulletin boards, so I should probably explain my seeming [about-face](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-thread-eleven.311139/page-2121#post-20295073) in the WTR thread. Basically, I think that in this whole situation the tail is wagging the dog. The rules we make and the aggressive moderation we employ on a site like Teamliquid.net exist only in service of the community. This is why the first rule there is "[THIS IS OUR HOUSE](http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/tl-community/17883-tlnet-ten-commandments)" and all the rules are super vague. Double standards should exist and are intentional on TL. SB would do well to follow the same ideas rather than being enslaved by their own rules. Zoat should be allowed to slightly spoil Star Wars (and note, he didn't even really spoil it) and violate rules in his thread with lesser consequences, just a warning, because he's earned the privilege. That's how these things should work!

  The reason is dumb, but Sufficient Velocity has always been infinitely better than SB because of the latter's terrible, terrible moderation and userbase so I'm fine with it.

    The mods are kind of power tripping on this. Under no reasonable definition of spoiler did he post spoilers, but he still got banned. Not even a "I've deleted you're comment and here's a warning"

  Many thanks for the info.

    No problem. Didn't see it posted anywhere, and I'm sure lots of people were unaware.

  I liked /u/eagleJarl's [take](https://forums.spacebattles.com/posts/20293854/) on this. I've heard a lot of bad things about the mods, and although I don't post a lot of their rules seem... bad. Rules for the sake of authoritarianism or something.

  Their rules on pirated content are particularly egregious. I'm definitely in favour of paying people for their work and all that, and although I'm not a big fan of the rule (being a dirty infohippie and all) I can respect it.

  What I can't respect is that they claim it's purely of legal reasons and has nothing to do with their politics.

  There are a lot of little things like that, that one in particular just irked me. I think /u/datapacrat also had some trouble over there.

    I did. For certain content in SI, I was given infraction points, a temp-ban, and had the thread locked. In order to be allowed to keep posting the story there, I would have had to submit new chapters for moderator approval or risk perma-banning or other such penalties. I decided that it wasn't worth the additional effort required, and started back-posting the existing chapters to Questionable Questing instead.

    I should note that while S.I. does contain content that can be considered adult in nature, I have consciously kept in mind a rule that any such content has to be written in a clinical, detached, and/or non-titillating fashion. "Body horror" would be a closer description than "erotica".

  Good to know, I was a few days behind and missed all that. SpaceBattles seems to do this sort of thing annoyingly often. :/ I've started to shy away and move to SV as well.

  Dammit, this story was pretty much the only reason I went to spacebattles, Now I'm going to have to set up a new account.

    Careful. There's a whole bunch of good stuff on it. Lots of people have story links in their signatures, so it's very easy to storybinge.

    :peers at his like 30 SV story tabs: I don't have a problem, I can stop any time I want.

      How? I can't seem to.

        Well don't actually _try_ obviously. It spoils the illusion.

    This and TGWP, which has finished today :(

  I need to catch up.
