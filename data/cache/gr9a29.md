  I love this conversation:

  > “What’s your experience with open combat, Queen Sulphur?” asked the Rose Titan.  “What have your previous missions looked like?”

  > “Well,” said Ana.  “Our Vocations are effective, as long as we have the advantage of close range and limited visibil – “

  > “We suck at it,” I said.  “Mostly, we try to infiltrate somewhere, get found out, and then run away screaming before we get pummelled.  It’s kind of a miracle we’ve lasted this long.”
  ```

    On the other hand, if Ana started packing guns and knives, stealing enemy uniforms, and using lethal force, she'd be even more of a nightmare to fight.

    I thought it was hillarious but I was surprised it didn't have a bigger impact.
    ```

      Yeah, it's a little weird how the militarized crew completely rolls with Wes's lack of professionalism, especially for a "we all take a cyanide pill if we're caught" mission.

        I think they all have situations similar to Wes/Ana. You don't end up as part of Brin's suicide squad if you have a whole lot of other options and they likely remember being new themselves.
        ```

        ```
        I'm kind of assumed that the rest of the crew silently agreed to ditch the weird confrontational newbies behind if things started burning but the rest of the chapter didn't seem to validate that assumption.

  Well that's sooner that the "every 2 mondays" advertised update schedule promised, and I ain't gonna complain!

    I normally update once every two weeks, but COVID killed my social life and job hours, so with all the free time I doubled it temporarily.  Depending on how things go, that might be permanent.  Thanks for reading!

  This story is added to the list of ones I regularly check. It's really good

  I really like the setting for this!

  We have a society resembling 1950s America, complete with malt shops and radio shows, combined with something of a fusion of magic and super powers. A lot of thought has gone into how this all works together - something that I'm sure has a good deal of appeal to the Rational crowd.
  ```

- u/CouteauBleu:
  ```
  Wait, why didn't the two teams take one Hira each for instant communication? That seems like a huge oversight.

  It's not like that would give away Hira's secret either, we've seen other characters with instant telepathy.
  ```

- u/Mr-Mister:
  ```
  It wasn't very clear how the white phosphorous was launched/thrown, and whether it was ignited remotedly, on impact, or on launch (which would be the only reason for the ignifugous suit).
