## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  You have been contacted by an otherworldly entity that gives you the ability to see into a parallel universe. This universe is the "regular" one that would have happened if you were not contacted and not given this power.

  At any point and for as long as you'd like, you may experience everything your parallel self currently is experiencing. You are a passive observer and do not have access to your other self's memories. If your other self dies or is otherwise incapacitated, you're out of luck.

  How can you exploit this power for personal gain or even somehow leverage it for an even greater purpose?

    Let's hope original you is smart, because this power seems tailor made for intellectuals. Simply put, whenever the original you comes up with an idea, you can steal it. He invents something? Steal it. He writes a paper? Steal it. He creates an app? Copy the code and steal it. This saves you a lot of time, since stealing work is much faster than actually doing said work. Time which you can use to do other work to get richer/more famous/more powerful/etc.
    ```

      I'd think spectating on consumption would be much more fruitful than on production, and require much less observation, too. It would benefit most from ideas that are hard to think of/through but easy and fast to write down, understand, or communicate, so the recipient of this power would be much better served if they were otherwise building a career in mathematics or some other theory-driven field, rather than one based more directly on labor 

      (even "intellectual" labor, ideas being a dime a dozen -- if they're e.g. an experimental or field scientist, fat lotta good copying the papers they read will do ya without the experiments to underlie them, though I guess you could "lie" and say you totally did them yourself. Copying something like an original novel could also work, though it would take a lot more time than a proof or short description of some new algorithm, and probably be less lucrative. Plus, unless you're in the habit of reading novels in a single sitting, you'd have to have impeccable timing skills or be constantly on the watch, lest you miss a chapter or three, vs. short papers that could easily be consumed without break).

      When spectating on alternate-you, do you retain the ability to move and speak? If so, acquiring a good voice recorder would be a priority, and maybe hiring a trusted party to transcribe it, too. Perhaps improving touch-typing skills as well, if you can speak and type simultaneously on separate lines of thought and increase your bandwidth that way.

      Another first step would be to seed the world with as much randomness as you can, the faster to accelerate divergence between timelines. Established producers might have their work sketched out in broad strokes a decade out, and copying alternate-them's products will look pretty sketchy. But nudging a butterfly that goes on to inspire the next generation of researchers might lead to quite different worlds some time down the line.

      Might also be some use in the short term on playing the market, e.g. if some inevitable news breaks in the alternate timeline about some public company's breakthrough/scandal, you can buy/short and make a quick buck.

      The riskiest but likely most impactful application of this power would be to go public -- demonstrate to sufficiently wealthy or powerful investors (incl. the gov't) what you can do and have them set up a facility to record your every alternate observation and fund career-switching programs and stuff. Dunno how much danger of being kidnapped and enslaved or vivisected you'd be there, though.

        >if they're e.g. an experimental or field scientist,

        Yeah I was thinking more along the lines of theoretical sciences, but it works even for experimental sciences. You don't even have to lie. One of the biggest bottlenecks in experimental sciences is that experiments take time to do and often fail to give good results. By observing your other self, you can avoid doing any of the experiments that failed, and just redo the experiments that succeeded. (Since there is some randomness, you won't be guaranteed the same result, but it is very likely if your experiment is designed correctly.) Simply not having to waste time on experiments that are doomed to failure is a large boon.

        >When spectating on alternate-you, do you retain the ability to move and speak?

        /u/GemOfEvan said you're a passive observer, so I'm guessing you literally can't do anything about the other you. And since your ability is "seeing", not "showing", I don't think you can take a video/audio record of the other you's experiences and show them to other people.
        ```

        - u/phylogenik:
          ```
          Yah I guess if you’re an established career-experimentalist with a preference for high risk, high reward projects where the answer is only interesting if it turns out in a particular way, you could come out ahead, but there’d still be an uncomfortable lag and you might have improved technique and stuff from doing the failed experiments, too. Though you could make one damn good PI by nudging your students/RAs towards stuff that worked in the alternate-verse.

          The moving and speaking I meant in our universe — if you’re just sharing a sensorium with alternate you and not e.g. in a paralyzed trance then you can repeat aloud the words alternate-you is looking out for your voice recorder to record, and not have to rely on memorizing stuff or flipping back and forth.

    I think my most important project would be to study myself when engaging in interdimensional communication, so as to develop a working scientific theory of the phenomena.  Goals would include communication with myself and others in same and additional dimensions.  Study of the otherworldly being is also of interest, but I assume contact will be rare enough to inhibit useful data gathering.

    Assuming none of that pans out, my goal is to establish situations where the other universe acts as a precognitive simulation with respect to 'my' universe.  For example paying agents to delay events subject to gambling so that I know the event outcome in advance.  Chance still plays a role, but my edge should pay off over time.  For stock markets and the like, perhaps targeted network congestion or more severe disruption events.  I'd have to be careful since too severe disruptions could cause the worlds to diverge too severely to be useful.

    As a longer term strategy, fund a neo-Luddite movement to delay the introduction of technological advances, and use observations from the other 'ahead' universe to inform investments / warn about detrimental trends.

      I feel like the stock market is chaotic enough as to be uselessly unpredictable with this power. Any changes you introduce probably butterfly fast enough to change any sudden spikes.
      ```

      - u/pixelz:
        ```
        I think it depends on the time scale.  Many spikes and dips are event driven.  Changes driven by press releases might not be useful (although that provides another target for delays to gain an edge), but changes driven by changes in related indicies (Dow jones, commodities) that are also delayed might be enough of an edge.  Also, dips and spikes get amplified by crowd-follower traders and automated trading, so knowing the direction in advance - even by an hour - can yield huge rewards.  There is still chaos to cope with, so you can't just keep risking all your capital on each bet, but you'll definitely be able to beat the market.

    Step one - see if I can observe while in motion; that is, experience my alternate walking down the street while I am walking down the street.

    Try to maintain parity at first, and see how quickly the *rest* of the universe diverges. This will give me some idea of how much true randomness there is in the universe; how quickly two separate universes drift apart without being pushed apart.

    --------------

    Step two: Start pushing the worlds apart. Don't respond to reddit posts that my alternate has responded to, and vice versa. Encourage different people (at Internet distances, as well as in person) to do different things. Incidentally, I'd like to encourage everyone who reads this post to greet the next stranger they see with a smile. See if I can get a feel for how much (short-term) influence my choices have on the world.

    --------------

    Step three: Attempt to open two-way communication with the other world. Have some scientists closely observe me while I am observing my other self's life, and see if they can pick up how itis happening and/or how to artificially replicate it.

    If step three is a success, we can then observe random alternate universes and copy their technology.

    If not, then... hmmm. Other-timeline me has never been contacted, he doesn't know to do things that I can take advantage of. I'm not quite sure how else to leverage this.

    I'd go to some writers' conferences and academic research institutions and buy rounds of drinks.

    Not for any deep purpose.  Just to get the butterflies flapping and changing causality.

    Hopefully authors in World 2 will be inspired by a slightly different set of ideas than authors in World 1.

    Then I'd get really, really good at speed typing and copy books that my World 1 self read.

    The typing would be slightly tedious, but I'd be able to publish a couple N.Y. Times bestseller level books a year.

  OK.

  I'm not sure if this is the best place (read subreddit) to put this problem forward but I wanted to know who would, rationally, win in a conflict between 

  A) Both parties are spontaneously teleported within a 1 km radius of each other, in a generic random wasteland like the ones shown in DBZ. Both parties have a general idea about each other's powers; Quirrel is a mage and uses a magical wand, and Jack Slash has a cutting power, for example.

  1. Jack Slash versus Professor Quirrel.

  2. The S9 versus Professor Quirrel.

  B) The same above situation except both parties have zero prior knowledge about the other party.

    I'll give it a go. This is super long haha, sorry.

    I haven't finished HPMOR yet so I don't know if there are some wack spells that destroy continents or something that HPMOR's Quirrel might have access to, so I'm just going to go with what I know from canon Harry Potter.

    I think it comes down to Avada Kedavara, I hope I'm spelling that right. Let's assume souls exist in Worm's world and the spell can properly rip them out or whatever - and bam, Quirrel has a "power" that's beyond anybody else's in Worm minus Contessa. Straight up death. Let's also give him the other two unforgivable curses; it seems reasonable he would know these.

    I do this because truthfully I'm just not sure what else we can reliably say Quirrel could do. He had on screen/text spells, yes, but none powerful enough or useful enough, I'd argue, to fight the S9. The HP universe really isn't good at indicating this kind of thing.

    Let's also assume Quirrel doesn't have a passenger and operates outside of Worm's rules in that regard.

    **Round 1)** Jack has no known limit on how far he can push his blades. If he can aim it right, he could just take a knife and shove it through Quirrel's throat.

    That said, again, if we're assuming Quirrel has other magic besides the three curses, which I'm sure he does, all bets are off. I have no idea what the guy could pull to protect himself here, or make it harder for Jack to target him, but he could probably do *something*. Again, this is kind of the problem with HP's universe.

    If we assume he can't, then Jack pretty reliably wins 8/10. A thousand meters is enough that the curses wouldn't hit him fast enough, if at all.

    If we let Quirrel block the knives somehow, then ultimately it would come down to slowly and painfully closing the distance to Jack until he could have the right range to hit him with the killing curse, or somehow teleporting toward Jack. If we say that the battlefield is so bland/easy to picture that Quirrel can safely apparate, then all bets are off and Quirrel probably wins 7/10, assuming Jack can't predict where he would apparate to.

    **Round 2)** This is a lot different. For the arc 11 "original" S9 we have:

    Bonesaw
    Jack Slash
    The Siberian
    Shatterbird
    Burnscar
    Cherish
    Mannequin
    Crawler
    possibly Pagoda, Murder Rat, and Hack Job but let's not focus on them for the moment.

    If all of them start 1000m away from Quirrel, the Jack problem is back, but let's assume he can block it again for the sake of argument, otherwise you just get Round 1's first scenario but way way worse for Quirrel. Now he has to deal with Shatterbird, who can fly at least at a moderately fast pace, Burnscar, who we don't have a range limit for on her fire-creation, and Crawler, who was bigger than a car and fast enough that 1000m probably wouldn't feel like much to him. At the least, others could distract Quirrel until Crawler approached. He isn't slow.

    Finally, the Worm Wiki says that Siberian has a range limit (from the wiki) of a few *miles* on her projection, and she can reform it at will. And let's say Hack Job is there, because Pagoda and Murder Rat probably wouldn't tip the scales much. But Hack Job has Oni Lee's teleportation and is a stupidly tough Brute on top of that. And he can teleport very quickly.

    So basically, as soon as this battle starts, Shatterbird is flying toward him, Crawler is running, and Burnscar is getting as close as she possibly can by making fire at her limit and teleporting into it. Siberian would be able to reach him almost instantly and just shove her hand through his throat, and Hack Job is doing much the same, since Oni Lee's teleportation was based on visuals, and this is a flat plane.

    Overall with this, I'm not confident Quirrel could survive unless he reacted *fast*. He'd have to immediately zap Siberian to make her fizzle out, killing curse Hack Job and Burnscar both without getting hit by either of them...it'd be tough. I think he could do it, but it'd be really tough.

    While this is happening, Jack is trying to knife him, Bonesaw is...steadily walking toward him, I guess, she can't do much at range except send some spiders, Mannequin is running, and so is Cherish.

    What's interesting, though, is the imperius curse. If he tried sending Siberian against the Nine, for instance, they would kill Manton or Manton would outmanuever them. So there's a 1/10 that Quirrel controls Manton through Siberian and stomps. Don't think that's likely, though.

    Even without her, though, I think Imperio is how he'd win. Fizzle out Siberian, imperio Hack Job and Burnscar and immediately he's got loads of firepower. It might be difficult to control Burnscar if her fire could somehow burn the energy of the spell itself, though. I say that because the kililng curse is viewed as a green physical energy, whereas I'm not sure Imperio ever has something like that. But eventually, I think he could do it.

    Assuming Imperio also doesn't work at long distances, he could just wait until Crawler got within range and control him, too, which I have no idea how the Nine could counter that. Siberian could probably kill Crawler, honestly, but if he doesn't go after her first, or goes after Cherish or Mannequin who are closer to him than Jack/Bonesaw/Manton.

    And sure, they would definitely figure out "he's controlling us once we get in range", but what could Crawler do besides hang back? The range he could spit acid is probably not much further than the range of the imperius curse.

    But let's assume Crawler notices and hangs back, and all Q has going for him is Hack Job and Burnscar.

    Once that happens things get weird.

    Siberian has just recovered from being fizzled as this happens. This all has to happen in a very short timeframe, otherwise Siberian just keeps spamming Quirrel until he slips up, and she can reform fast, too. It's only the chance of imperio-ing Burnscar that gives Quirrel any edge. So:

    Shatterbird probably sends all the sand and glass she can spare to him, but it seems reasonable that Quirrel could block it somehow. Burnscar and Hack Job are attacking Manton, Bonesaw, or Jack, who are all hanging back or not quite to Quirrel yet. They're immune to HJ's power nullification but not immune to very very large amounts of fire...but still, HJ and Burnscar have passengers, and Jack wins by virtue of that. They both could try attacking Bonesaw, but as much as fire still hurts her, she's ludicrously durable. BUT Burnscar and (probably?) Hack Job would be immune to whatever pathogen she could try releasing from her stomach, as she does, or any of her other tricks.

    The most likely thing, then, is Quirrel realizing that attacking Jack isn't working, and just trying to burn Manton and Bonesaw into oblivion instead. We can assume he knows about Manton based on the pre-battle knowledge. By this time, Siberian is reformed and has realized what Burnscar is trying to do. She reforms to attack Burnscar and narrowly misses the timeframe. Manton dies in a ball of fire and she fizzles out. This is less likely than Siberian just killing Burnscar, but once that happens, Quirrel has a lot less options unless we buff him, so for Quirrel to have much chance, we have to assume Manton dies.

    I think Siberian killing Burnscar and Hack Job in this case is the most likely scenario, including everything leading up to it, so let's say 6/10 to the S9, because of her.

    Without that, it's just slow painful avoidance and out-manuevering the S9 against one another. He could do it, but it'd be very complicated and one wrong move would end him. 4/10 to Quirrel on a good day.

      Awesome! Thanks for replying.

      Doesn't Professor Quirrel have really strong magical prowess and quite nifty normal spells like Disillusionment (which makes the caster totally invisible), Stunning Spell (which is strong enough to reliably stun any opponent that doesn't have extra magical defenses, like Hagrid's giant-heritage skin) and of course, Avada Kedavra.

      I was thinking more like what battle tactics could Jack ( & Co) bring to the table against Prof. Quirrel and vice versa. It's​ of course apparent to Quirrel that his opponents aren't wizards and witches and it's apparent to Jack and Co that Quirrel is a mage (read: wand→ spells, charms etc., probably magical bolts which means long-ranged warfare→ possibly weak physical defenses) and his wand is his sole weapon.

      But knowing Prof. Quirrel, it's probably quite safe to assume that he has a spare Firebolt/Nimbus 2000 upon his person, just in case he needed to gain air superiority.

        No problem! Didn't even think about brooms.

        Where did you get those spells from? I don't remember them.

        Tactics wise? I'm not really sure, I was kinda going for "they both just want to kill each other". Tactics wise, the S9 are strong enough and have a consistent enough strategy in the Wormverse that the only way to do anything to them is to pull something completely unexpected, like the ambush that was pulled once the games started. Not sure how Quirrel could play to that imo besides just using something as drastic as Imperius.

        Quirrel already has air superiority- he can fly. Broomstick-bones, remember?

  - u/Gurkenglas:
    ```
    To protect against the cutting power, Quirrel casts a matter-focussed variant of Protego. Jack notices Quirrel's shard, talks to it, and gets the heck scared of Quirrel's general problem-solving ability, and of his shard having lots of offshoots going all over the world.

    Meanwhile, the Simurgh notices a perturbation in time, and that a new shard has always been here. She changes course slightly, and one of its offshoots shall be severed, for that is one of her missives.

    Quirrel apparates onto DBZ wasteland pillars, looking for the enemy. Jack wonders where his teammates are, but his shard Taboo's the question. Jack tells Quirrel's shard that he is amused by this Bahl's Stupefaction story - could it illustrate the effects? After a few pillars with no sight of Jack, Quirrel's intent to kill shows him the easiest solution - transfigure some air to poison Jack wherever he might hide. He apparates away to have some celebratory champagne. Jack becomes quite confused as to where he is, to the extent he is allowed to, and begins trying to wander out of the wasteland.

    A few hours later, drunk Quirrel doesn't feel so good, and goes to kill the wine-seller who poisoned him. As that one has closed up shop, he places a transfigured troll tooth under the counter, timing the end of the transfiguration such that the shop will be open. He keels over and succumbs behind the till.

    Staring at the stars, Quirrel contemplates his mistakes. They are quite unlike earlier follies. He might be getting old. He will have to speed up his acquisition of the Stone, once some schmuck shortly finds one of his less foolishly hidden horcruxes.

    On one of her less well-understood paths, Contessa fetches a particular houseplant. The door she opens to it confuses an interdimensional connection, and Quirrel will be sleeping for a long, long time.

    Jack Slash starves to death in an uninhabited alternate Earth, for Quirrel never died to end the scenario.

    Of course Quirrel wins! Quirrel OP.

  You are an humanlike alien whith blue and orange morality from a  fantasy setting.
  You start whith no knowledge of the modern world  , and look like a normal human .
  You can know what someone is thinking if you are a few meters from them  .


  Also if you can get some minutes alone whith someone you can read their  memories , and modify some of them . 
  Also you can teleport to the  specific place you consider your home for a long time from any point of the planet (you have to live there for a while  and can't change it very often).

  A group of people from you home world  know who you are and are trying to oppose you , they can  teleport to any point of the world given a few seconds of concentration and can sometimes detect where you are, especially if you are using your powers.

  Take over the world.

  Hard mode :Reverse muncking this power.
  ```

  - u/xXnormanborlaugXx:
    ```
    Step zero: Read someone's memories, deep enough to understand some of the modern world. First target of opportunity you can be alone with for a few minutes. Steal as much money as you can from them, then wipe their memories of you. 

    Step one: Spend the money on a plane ticket. Go to a new city, offer to have sex with strangers to get them alone, then rob them and wipe their memories. If you get attacked at this point, you're kinda fucked, so just stay mobile. Keep moving to new cities until you have a decent nest egg. 

    Step two: Get a mobile home. Live in it long enough for it to become a recall point. Don't use your powers at all during this time.

    Step three: Pay someone to continually drive the mobile home across country. That'll give you a recall point that will be difficult to find and stake out. Visit it only often enough to maintain it as your checkpoint, and if never sleeping in the same place twice is enough to never reset home base, never visit and do that instead.

    Step four: Become a counselor/life coach/trainer. With your ability to edit memories, you can remove trauma and add on valuable skills. Keep it subtle. Have people take actual classes for a month, then edit in way more information over that month. Coding, law school, languages, any kind of training that requires a lot of memorization. Pay experts for one on one sessions and take more things from them to train others in. As your reputation grows, get bodyguards, and train them as well. It doesn't look like you can put in muscle memory, but memories of sharpshooters and martial arts masters, combined with actual practice, would certainly help.

    Step five: Use graduates of your school as spies. Get them hired by top companies, which should be easy with their skills. Suborn superiors. If they can be converted directly by false memories of loyalty, do that. If they can't, hire them away as teachers for your counseling company and let your graduates be promoted. If they don't go for that either, assassinate them. Get access to billionaire CEOs and have them sign away all of their wealth to your most promising student. This should be someone almost as smart as you.

    Step six: Edit the memories of your most prominent student to believe that they are an alien with your powers, and that the powers gradually faded away as you adjusted to the new dimension. Use plastic surgery to give them your face, and get a new one. Make them believe that you are merely the excellent teacher they hired after their memory editing skills faded, and that regular one on one meetings with you are normal. Leave the goal of taking over the world.

    Step seven: Let your student go off. Keep bodyguards, as is fitting for the student's prized teacher, but spend most of the time in the background. Check in frequently to make sure they're staying loyal and give any more good ideas if you have them. If they badly need information, kidnap and scan whoever you need to, then edit it in and credit the info to spies.

    Step eight: If you get attacked earlier than step six by the people from your home world, bail. Mobile home, then fly away as fast as you can. After step six, use the student as bait and try to kill them. If they manage to kill the student, let them believe you're dead, and have a new pawn take their place. After the other aliens are either dead, or believe that you're dead, do the same kind of graduates into access plan that you did on CEOs on world leaders instead. Make each of them believe they're you, and that you are someone they need to maintain regular contact with to maintain their cover. 

    At this point you've basically won. Maybe set up a world government if you get tired of traveling around to keep editing memories, but it's safer to just keep things looking the way they are. Now you can do whatever your real goal was, with your blue/orange morality.
