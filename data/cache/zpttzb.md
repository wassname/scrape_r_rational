## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  At what point does He Who Fights With Monsters get good? I'm about halfway through the first book after seeing it recommend here previously and so far it seems to be "/r/athiesm's most obnoxious turboposter becomes isekai Marty Stu". Is it like this though all 8 books?

    I don't think it ever does, I was hooked to see an Aussie, a non white one at that in a story, but it's not good. 

    Your description is pretty spot on, the plot isn't good enough to overcome it's other problems.

      Besides the plot being not good enough, and the other issues already mentioned in this thread, by the time I dropped it a year or two ago, plot _progression_ (good or otherwise) had ground to a halt and hardly anything was happening.

    I was really into it at first, then dropped it. The fight scenes became really repetitive, and I ended up just skimming them. 

    My biggest pet peeve was that Jason's character. The guy was obviously written to be "dark" but came across as an edgy prick. The author really took the whole "He's a social animal, a master manipulator, he walks into a room and owns it!" and ran with it. 

    The constant pop references and edginess and "he so crazy, that's why we love him," didn't help.
    ```

  - u/Dragongeek:
    ```
    What makes *He Who Fights with Monsters* """good""" is that unlike a lot of stuff in the genre (western Isekai generally), the protagonist is portrayed as having well-developed social skills and is, as he explicitly states about himself in the story, "good at people". This makes it a bit trope-defying because protagonists in the genre are usually antisocial shut-in types. I suspect this is why it's so popular. 

    From what I remember, it clears the (low) bar for decent webfiction but not much more. If I were you, I'd drop it.

      > the protagonist is portrayed as having well-developed social skills and is, as he explicitly states about himself in the story, "good at people"

      We're *[told that](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAbility)* he's "good at people"; I wouldn't say he's portrayed that way: when the story starts he's a college dropout estranged from his family who's been cuckolded by his own brother. His primary mode of social interaction is haranguing people he just met about all the things he dislikes about their political system. I doubt it's the kind of behavior that would get him invited to many dinner parties.

      >  This makes it a bit trope-defying because protagonists in the genre are usually antisocial shut-in types. I suspect this is why it's so popular. 

      I can't recall a single instance of him missing his friends (or even of having friends) back on Earth, so while the author may have intended him not to be an antisocial shut-in...

      > From what I remember, it clears the (low) bar for decent webfiction but not much more. If I were you, I'd drop it.

        I could've worded my comment better, something along the lines of "the author attempts to portray" maybe, because I agree with you. 

        I also don't want to be too uncharitable towards the readers/author, but I could easily see this type of character being written/imagined *by* an antisocial shut-in who's maybe read *How to win friends and Influence People* along with a bit of *The Prince* and some misc. "Dating Guides" who thinks that the way the protagonist acts is genuinely how very socially competent people act

  Recommending, [A Thing of Vikings](https://archiveofourown.org/works/10408971) A How to Train Your Dragon Fanfiction that's up to 1.5 million words and still routinely updating. 

  The hook for this is the inserting of HTTYD into actual history around the year 1050, and then continuing to let history play out, a history where a unknown viking island suddenly becomes a geopolitical powerhouse with an inventive and kindhearted (for the era, the for kids vibe is toned down to be more realistic) ruler, Chief Hiccup, who also happens to have control over hoards of dragons. 

  I can't claim the portrayals of history are entirely accurate, but to my layman's understanding of the era it's at least plausible. 

  There is no magic or anything, so far the only fanciful element is the Dragons, and some simplification of political events and processes if only to keep the story moving.

  This week I have another niche request. Looking for some good strategy novels. And I mean that in a broad sense, army commander, base building, kingdom building, things like that.

  And by all this I mean stories that aren’t junky, not like those wanky light novel kingdom builders.

  These are some concepts that are pretty interesting that I’d like to read more of, but there’s none that I’m aware of. I’ve already read Castle Kingside.

  This request was brought on by me reading [Born Different](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/60430/born-different-monster-evolution-litrpg), which does something neat in that the MC is entirely focused on commanding the other spiders and has no notable personal strength of his own, at least thus far.

  Army commanding and kingdom building are interesting concepts, but I just never see any well done and competent versions of them. Webfiction or published, either is fine by me.

      - u/Dragongeek:

        "Yonder" must be giving these authors a ***hefty*** signing bonus. 

        Like, considering how many of the "big name" webfiction authors have signed up to it in some form (ErraticErrata and Pirateaba come to mind) and these authors aren't exactly *struggling*. I mean, when you judge by Patreon alone:

        - ErraticErrata: about 5k USD/Month
        - Pirateaba about 25k USD/Month

        those numbers aren't insignificant and I wouldn't be surprised if Yonder paid six figures to acquire the digital rights. I mean, it's hard to pin an exact number on how many dollars it requires for someone to "sell their souls", but I'd estimate it's between one and ten cumulative yearly salaries as an instant lump sum (assuming no extreme things like gambling debts). Now, I don't think this is completely "selling their souls" but for an author who's always posted everything online for free so that everyone can read it suddenly doing a complete about-face and switching to a (probably) highly predatory micro-transaction-hell system would--I think--require at least a little bit of soul-selling. 

        More broadly speaking, I wonder if this "Yonder" business model can actually work beyond its (presumed) current phase of funneling VC money into acquiring authors. I hope it doesn't.

            I wouldn't be surprised if "the only ones interested in" actually means "the only ones willing to pay me without caveats." Wildbow has mentioned before that he's sought out traditional publishing for *Worm*, but publishers pushed for rewriting sections of the story, which he found unacceptable. In that sense, no publisher is interested in publishing Worm as it currently exists. I'd expect that Pirateaba would get a similar response from publishers when approached.
            ```

              >Wildbow has mentioned before that he's sought out traditional publishing for Worm, but publishers pushed for rewriting sections of the story, which he found unacceptable

              Did he ever mention which sections, out of curiosity? 

              It makes perfect sense to me that *some* editing would be necessary to adapt a web serial into novel form, and I would assume getting professional editors involved would likely make the work stronger for it.

              So I guess I'm curious if Wildbow disagreed with editing specific sections or in general.

              Well, Pirataba already has a done deal with Podium Audio for Gravesong and they're only waiting on the rights to use one more song before publishing the audiobook. It seems only the text-rights for Gravesong are going on Yonder. 

              Considering the rest of TWI has followed a pattern of free books online and purchasable audiobooks (which have been hugely successful in terms of sales on audible) it doesn't surprise me that no publisher was interested in Gravesong as is: it very much is a companion to (monolithic in scale) TWI as it plays in the same world and has some character overlap iirc. I can see how it would struggle to stand alone on a physical bookshelf, and it's a big "?" to see if fans would actually go out and buy it when they're so used to webfiction. I think publishers might also simply be scared of the scale since TWI ranks among one of the biggest hunks of literature, ever, which is quite a feat.

        Reading into this a bit this is really disappointing. A microtransaction, region-locked, drmed-to-hell mobile app which it seems to want to gamify reading and where the chapters are further parcelled out to sections and the total cost for the guide(estimated by a redditor in the link in parent) could be hundreds of dollars for content you can not keep or read where you want.


        I do not begrudge the author for getting paid for their work but the thought that something like the app it is published on might actually take off is horrific.


        Edit: upon further consideration the gamify bit seems more like the social media model of creating addiction to capture attention.

    My recommendation would be Zero Requiem. It is a Code Geass / ASOIAF crossover where Lelouch is reborn into ASOIAF as Lelouch Velaryon, Heir to house Velaryon right before the Ninepenny Kings War (Lelouch is of similar age to Tywin Lannister and Aerys Targaryen). No Code Geass powers transfer over, just a strategic mind with some modern ideas. 

    Has some of the best strategic battles and politics among ASOIAF fics.

    Maybe Saruman of the Many Devices? Warhammer 40k or fantasy have a lot of books where the military conflict is the main plot, but I'd have to look through the ones that I own for being more about the army commanding in comparison to them commanding the army as part of their character kind of a deal. 

    The fic posted on spacebattles called Apocalypse Reborn: Fantasy RTS Reincarnation is well very fun, but not like super serious about most things including how it takes itself.

    Maybe the Iron Elves series about a fantasy set in a more musket warfare situation which I liked but weren't super rational. There are bits in like the Codex Alera which was a young adult fantasy roman series by Jim Butcher which again I liked but isn't super rational. The Lost Fleet series had more of an Admiral than a General lead in that the lead character is a space fleet admiral and who we get to see do a lot of fleet commanding and some being the overarching military leader for marines a fair few times, but uhh well fun but I wouldn't say is super rational maybe rationalist stretching the category a bit.

    Ender's Game? It does have a hyperintelligent mc though, which is the wanky part of it I guess. 

    If you're okay with small scale tactics, then [Cosmosis](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/43212/cosmosis) is quite good. The protagonist has special powers, but the applicability of those powers lie mostly in strategy and utility rather than physical/destructive prowess, as least so far (I'm 2 books in). The enemies are never dumb, and most battles have a lot of back and forth as both sides get used to the enemy's tactics and develop new ones. 

    In a *very broad* sense, Ar'Kendrythist also contains some good strategy elements. Aside from the rock-paper-scissors nature of individual battles, later on the series goes pretty deep into kingdom building through diplomacy and force projection. It's not as rigorous as your normal undergrad international relations class I guess, but I found it nuanced enough to be interesting. There's also a good bit of philosophy, although it's pretty conventional. There's some cool logistics stuff done with having teleportation as a default spell in the world, as well as the ability to make food or water through magic.

    *Safehold* by David Weber is a published series that's all about armies and logistics and war on a grand scale. The author has a very wordy writing style, so I'd recommend trying out a copy from the library before you drop any cash, but I personally really enjoyed the series.
    ```

    - u/dysfunctionz:
      ```
      I kinda have to de-rec, even though I used to be a fan of David Weber. The Safehold series was published after he got big enough to no longer be beholden to editors, and it has his worst aspects on display. When you say "wordy", I would say: half a book where nothing happens but people having meetings about what happened in the last book, and meetings where spies discuss what happened in that meeting they were spying on, and the inner monologue of characters you don't care about reflecting on those meetings.
      ```

      - u/lo4952:
        ```
        Oh I don't disagree; I think I skimmed it more than I read it. Still, there were enough interesting moments in there to be worth it, imo. Or at least worth a casual glance.

        - u/dysfunctionz:
          ```
          I will say that if OP is looking for competent army commanding fic, the battles in Weber's books still don't disappoint. He's a scholar of military history and it shows. You just have to slog through about five hundred pages of cartoonishly corrupt political figures backstabbing each other in meetings to get to the one satisfying battle.

    - u/Dragongeek:
      ```
      >I dunno where the authors all went

      They got older and became less interested in writing pulpy slashfiction with children as protagonists

      In all seriousness, while I'd agree that JKRs behavior has contributed to the decline of the fandom, I'd say a larger contributor is just that Harry Potter, as an IP, is getting old and the attempts to breathe life back into it have flopped pathetically (Cursed Child, Fantastic Beasts, Grindelwald, etc). Kids today just aren't growing up with it as much anymore. 

      Also, defying the norm, JKR actually became a *worse* author as time went on, and in between cultivating an aggressive hatred towards her own most devoted fans for some reason (ego probably), she never managed to recapture that which made the first books so popular in her later books. It's why the later books of the HP series are (at least to me) rather weak and unfocused. 

      Finally, now that they hype train that chugged on relentlessly for decades is slowed, people are more willing to stick their necks out and point out that HP isn't actually that good. Lots of is just lazy worldbuilding and bad storytelling that, while new at the time, doesn't hold up that well today.

      - u/None:
        ```
        Working with a party in early levels can cover dead draws. The class grows over time to cover weaknesses. When there is more mana, mulligans are feasible. It's just like any caster with slow mana regen, or a D&D warlock that recovers spells on rest.
        ```

      - u/Flashbunny:
        ```
        Turns are time-based rather than strictly sequential, and he's the only one taking turns. On a bad draw, he's scrambling to dodge/stay away/rely on allies, but he's not defenceless the way a player waiting for the opponent to take their turn would be.

    If you want card game fiction I've got a few never-to-be-completed pieces, of which [A Metagamer's Nightmare](https://archiveofourown.org/works/25209853) is the only one I've ever posted and "ended." (very loosely speaking... spoiler alert but I kill the MC in CH3 because I lose interest quickly.) I also have some stuff in my archives that I share with people who ask. Stuff that's even less post-worthy than the linked story, but might directly scratch the itch you're looking for if your response to "A Metagamer's Nightmare" is, "this is great and I'd read thirty chapter of it if the author wasn't a lazy inconsistent bastard."

    I've been working on different card-game fiction projects for a few years now, because Yugioh 5Ds laid its hooks into me and never let go, but I've been overall pretty disappointed by the recent surge of RoyalRoad Card-game-lit. They're all just excuses for multi-power OP MCs with a baked-in power granting mechanism.

    I'm of the opinion that a truly respectful take on the genre should include all the best parts of:

    * opening packs
    * building decks
    * playing tightly-controlled controlled games that hinge on random change that deckbuilding strategies mitigate
    * drawing THE NUTS when you absolutely have no other choice
    * adapting to a changing metagame where people see the choices you're making and make their own deckbuilding choices in response.

    Unsurprisingly, writing all those things into a compelling piece of prose is extremely nontrivial.

      [A Summoner Awakens](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/60054/a-summoner-awakens-a-card-based-gamelit-progression) has all of the cards always available (or always active), and *All the Skills* seemed similar from the bit I read.  There was also a Worm altpower or two where Taylor got Magic The Gathering powers, but it was only the power of *specific* cards, without anything deck-like about the mechanics.

      It’s a cute story but it’s a bit too… childish(?) to really scratch the itch. 

      Part of it is the MC is literally like 7-11 YO and that definitely lets the author skirt the meat and potatoes. Chapters are also pretty spartan, to be honest. 

      It’s best chapters are the middle or so of book 1 where he is trying to get the cooking class. The whole story should basically be that. Do a bunch of random skill shit to gather skills, consolidate into classes over time. 

      Instead, it’s lazily plotted. The MC will get >!2 legendary skill cards!< because his >!family has 3 legendaries in the same deck!< and the new >!legendary dragon egg!< will definitely >!hatch for him as the climax of book 2!<. It’s all just a bit popcorn-y. 


      Not to rag on it too much. I spent October on the patreon, so I’m not saying it’s not worth checking out. Def is. Guess I just wanted to rant about its potential 🤷🏼‍♂️

        Honestly it sounds like the kind of story that plagues Royal Road- an OP MC who gets all of the cards (or skills) and uses them to do whatever the author wants. I’ll check it out but I will do so with caution.

  Avatar 2 is good.

  I don't mean, "good like a blowjob." I mean, good like the *The Fellowship of the Ring.* It is a movie made with pure intent and noble goals. It is the first entry in a new epoch-making epic, compared to which Avatar (2009) was only the one-off, filled with inconsistencies, soon-to-be-retconned, "The Hobbit"-analogue prequel.

  By 2032, we will all have watched (at least) 5 avatar movies apiece, and be frantically speculating over the grand reveals to take place in movie 6.

  Watch it. Watch it in imax, if you can. Watch it twice, if you can afford to. Stumble out of the theater in a fugue, confused at the bizarre, cold, grey hell you've been thrust into after three hours of lush tropical paradise.

  Don't expect grand intrigue or novel ideas, because it is not the *complex* kind of good. But it *is* good, and it is *good*.

  edit: I'm writing this review drunk. It should be taken as an accurate measure of my *emotional* response to Avatar 2, rather than my rational response.

    Did Avatar 2 have a (somewhat) enduring impact on you, or was it just a single moment?  I'll check back later.

    - u/GaBeRockKing:
      ```
      I don't expect Avatar 2 to have an enduring impact on me. Alone, anyways. Book 1 in a grand series rarely does. This is a statement about how I'll feel about Avatar 2 after Avatar 5 or 6 concludes the series.
      ```

      - u/tjhance:
        ```
        this is kind of hard to buy - mostly because Avatar 2 is, in fact, the second in the series.

        If Avatar 1 is dismissed as anomalous as soon as Avatar 2 comes out, why should I expect Avatar 2 to be different? What reason is there to think "ah yeah, Avatar 2 doesn't have an enduring impact on me, but it'll be amazing once it becomes part of the grand narrative" when that evidently didn't work out for Avatar 1?
        ```

        - u/GaBeRockKing:
          ```
          The fellowship of the ring was *also* the second book in the series. Avatar 1, like the hobbit, is a simple, entertaining story that provides the background and setup for a future heroic epic that arrives only after a long timeskip. It can be experienced as an entertaining but shallow standalone work, and will only reveal its full grandeur in retrospective.

          Avatar 2 suffers from being neither a standalone work nor part of a unified, completed series. People can't praise it for its setups when they aren't even aware they'll have payoffs.

    Eh, I found it... watchable but very hollywood, a bit too long, and, I dunno. Forgettable? Average? 

    Somehow, neither the themes (yes, perhaps we shouldn't do a colonialism. a critical message that we all need to hear again) nor the writing (which kid was that, again?) really caught my interest. Then again I haven't seen Avatar 2009, so maybe it works better specifically as a sequel. (A friend of a friend works for Weta and did some VFX work on it, so we all went as a group to see his name in the credits.) My partner says that the plot felt like the first film all over again. 

    In particular, I really wish hollywood would stop shooting every damn action scene as a desperate scramble, and instead show some of these characters trying to think tactically for once. I like seeing people think; it's one of my favorite qualities of rational fiction that the authors try it a bit then give it to their characters. There wasn't much of that going on, in terms of it being visible or something you're intended to follow. Maybe it was all genius moves, but I don't know that and you won't either. Mostly people just did things at each other as the plot requested. 

    And the soundtrack might benefit from being more musical and having personality, instead of emotionally-dictating every scene with generic cinematic soundtrack. 

    I will say that it is *extremely* pretty. The water effects, the bioluminescent everything, the not-dragons, the water not-dragons, the >!armored whale vs. whaling ship!< scenes toward the end, it is visually a spectacle.  Absolutely the high point of the entire film is how it looks -- about 1/2 to 2/3rds of the time, something beautiful and wondrous is on screen. The 3D somewhat worked for me even though I don't have depth perception, and it was striking.

    Before I watch it, can you answer 1 question (recommend using a spoiler tag just in-case)

    Do the human associated faction(s) job as hard as they did in Avatar 1? I cannot stomach watching another military loss porn again - the level of tactical incompetence in A1 was truly a turnoff.
    ```

    - u/k5josh:
      ```
      They might actually job harder. Plus they're not just incompetent, they're also cartoonishly evil.

    - u/GaBeRockKing:
      ```
      Depends what you mean by "job." >!Arrows still punch through helicopter windshields, but the Na'vi take obvious losses and win tactically largely because they do a decent job of picking their fights-- isolated logistical links and towards the end a whaling ship that's been commandeered by Avatar commandoes.!< In short, Avatar is still fundamentally a story where bows beat guns, but the people with bows aren't shy about picking up the guns and the people with guns are pragmatic about developing their own bows.

    I just had to come back to this post after watching the movie. Holy shit. What a waste of three hours of my life that I'll never get back. You'd better have been completely shitfaced drunk to have appreciated this film, because there is absolutely no way it approaches anything resembling *good* to me. 

    I mean visually it was decent, although the bar for CGI is a lot higher now than it was back when the first film dropped. 

    But that's literally it. I've seen fucking computer *screensavers* with better plot than this film. The story beats are tired and predictable. The characters could not be more cliche if they tried. James Cameron really just seems to want to watch ships sinking in HD. 

    And the most grating of all is exactly as I feared - how utterly idiotic the humans are behaving in this film. Acting like a Saturday morning cartoon villain and jobbing equally hard.

    I could rant more but I think I'm just gonna leave it here to avoid wasting more thought on this film.
    ```

    - u/GaBeRockKing:
      ```
      TBH I *did* watch it high. But I still enjoyed it after rewatching it sober. I don't really understand the complaints about the human military doing poorly in this film-- a whaling boat with a single special ops crew lost to an army of Na'vi plus a superhumanly intelligent leviathan after inflicting casualties. That's not really 'jobbing'. Even the tactics used prior to the battle aren't really out of line with what historical militaries have used to smoke out indigenous rebel leaders. Yes, the antagonists were capital E Evil, but the stakes they were fighting for (antiaging liquid, a colony with which to save the human race) are exactly the sort of thing that would motivate that.

      I get the complaint about the story beats being "predictable" though would contend that "tired" is a matter of individual judgment rather than objective fact. Avatar 2 is fundamentally a story about the family moving to a new town after the father gets a new job. That's nothing groundbreaking, but there's always room for variation and novel execution on the subject.

      I was being very specific when I compared the Avatar series to star wars and lord of the rings, because the whole *point* of a heroic epic is that it harkens back to a storytelling tradition stretching from the epic of gilgamesh while presenting culture heroes that pronounce modern values in a novel context. I can understand disliking Avatar 2, but the criticisms you give it seem like they sort of miss the point.
      ```

      - u/fish312:
        ```
        I'll admit I'm very critical of movies in general so I'd say Avatar leans more towards the norm rather than the exception. FWIW I dislike most marvel films, the new matrix sequel, and the new star wars sequels so maybe I'm just hard to please.

        **That said, heavy spoilers ahead:**

        Jake Sully is a thoroughly unlikable protagonist to me. This is a personal opinion - I was rooting for the humans all the way through A1 because this guy is a straight up *traitor* to the entire human race except that *nobody else* on the human side except the colonel even seem to realise this. He got his hair tips wet by some chick and goes all space Pocahontas selling out everyone and we're supposed to be *on his side?* 

        Because of the above, it was especially unpleasant how much plot armor the "good guys" (emphasis on the quotes) got. They fly their wyverns straight into machine gun fire like idiots, and all the bullets automagically miss them. Time and time again they pull risky dumb moves and don't get punished for it, instead we're treated to more scenes of helicrafts crashing and human pilots getting shot by arrows through windshields.

        You know what a competent military would have done? Shell the fuck out of the natives from beyond visual range. Maybe load some nerve agents and white phosphorus for good measure. Fuck it, if you wanna get close *at least* bring some real armor. How about a tank? No? I'm begging you, even an IFV halftrack with a 20mm autocannon would toast anything the blue hippies have to offer and be able to take a few hits instead of, I don't know, *glass windshields on everything?*

        Now on to tough guy colonel. What happened to tactics? Your goal was to kill Jake Sully, a slippery insurgent and the single most dangerous adversary on the enemy side, you *had him in your rifle sights* multiple times and you *refused* to take the shot, because why, you're afraid you'll trigger the natives? Who still *attacked you anyway?* Go in, pull the trigger, extract, what's so hard about that?

        Why anger the other natives anyway? They have no quarrel with you. They didn't care about your fishing ops. They could've been great informants even if not allies had you tried to buy them over. Instead you burned their village to the ground *for nothing!!* If you're going after Osama, torching the local bazaar is a great way to make new enemies willing to aid him.

        What's with bringing a *known hostile enemy agent* right into the middle of your own ops, *unguarded and unrestrained*? He might be your son, but he's clearly siding with the enemy, and you let him in on your plans and run loose in your own ship with plenty of time to sabotage, disrupt or destroy your stuff. And he did. 

        Also why bother making threats if you're not going to follow up on them? You keep telling Jake the awful things you'll do if he doesn't stand down, but he doesn't, and you don't do it anyway. Like a villain who prefers to gloat rather than take action, the hero knows he's not gonna let the princess fall into a pit so the 10th time you dangle her there doesn't really scare him anymore. Come on, make good on your threats instead of just cuffing everyone to a railing. Don't want to slit a throat? At least stab their leg maybe? 

        For an adversary that has shown them no quarter and doesn't hesitate to hurt them and their kind, the humans *really* showed way too much restraint when dealing with the navi. Which makes their eventual defeat all the more infuriating.
        ```
