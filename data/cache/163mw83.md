  I finished Practical Guide to Evil, months ago. I've reread it once, and have read many specific chapters multiple times. I would like to discover some titles with a protagonist like Catherine Foundling. Someone smart and willing to do anything to achieve what they want, but are portrayed as good people. I'm also fine if they're not portrayed as good people but it is tiring, seeing people who I relate to cast in the role of villains. Really, any story with a smart and non-hypocritical in terms of morals protagonist, I would love. I absolutely hate characters who refuse to compromise on their morals just because if they make a deal with someone who's not purely good in intentions they think that will make them bad or evil.

    World of Prime's protagonist is (the equivalent of) a lawful good paladin to the martial aspect of a lawful good goddess. I would say he is willing to do anything necessary as long as it doesn't go against his alignment, which is essential to maintaining his relationship with his goddess and by extension his paladin abilities. That does present a problem sometimes, but it's handled thoughtfully by the characters. It's a breath of fresh air, imo.

      Thank you for your recommendation. I'll be sure to check it out.

    Alex Verus series has a protagonist who is like that. He's willing to do anything to achieve what he wants, but he's not a villain. It's an urban fantasy series though, and Alex's power is to see the near future. 

    Maybe Darrow from Red Rising series. He starts off as a revolutionary with a good cause, but things get worse before they get better. First book feels like hunger games in space, but it quickly gets more complicated and big.

    It has a different tone, but the author recently started writing their next work, [Pale Lights.](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/65058/pale-lights) Book One is already finished and is absolutely worth reading as a standalone story, which is something that wasn't really true of PGtE. It has two MC's: A boy from the slums who lies, steals, and kills for his own benefit, but cares for other people more than he wants to admit, and a former noble with a strict honor code who is both willing to compromise when she needs to, and willing to kill when she needs to. Doesn't exactly fit what your asking for, but I figure you'd be interested in it.

      May be not for me: too much murder, rot, fall, maliciousness and evil for me.

      But quite well written, if you have no trouble with stories in grimderp worlds.

      I'm definitely reading that. I'm just waiting for it to accumulate more chapters. Thanks for mentioning it, though! I think it's still ongoing, right? It doesn't matter. I'm not ready for it mentally.
      ```

      - u/dapperAF:

        It is ongoing, and slow-going, *and* **extremely** binge-able. NGL I stayed up until 4am on a work night just gorging myself on the first book.

        Highly recommend it.

        Also - I would not call it a grimderp world. It is grim and dark yes, but the setting is simply more of a gothic/post-apocalyptic take rather than unending tragedy like eg. Pact. There is certainly success and reason to celebrate for the protags.

  I have a soft spot for stories which start with an entertainingly cracked-out premise, but the characters deal with it intelligently, and the author is good enough to make it entertaining along the way. I came across a perfect example. [Tanking Hits (I Level When I Get Hit in the Balls)](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/60160/tanking-hits-i-level-when-i-get-hit-in-the-balls) is exactly what it sounds like: a LitRPG whose protagonist has a unique leveling system centered around slaying monsters within ±6 levels of him after those monsters have hit him in the nuts. The characters are likable people who do reasonable things, the action scenes are well written (albeit wince-worthy at certain moments), and the author is obviously having way too much fun writing it.

  Picked up Unsong over the weekend, and >!Uriel being in a big hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico!< is hitting things a bit too on the nose. I enjoyed Eva & Aaron, the cousin as well. I was disappointed >!to see that the story drifts away from the three of them and the Unitarians!<, but I’ll likely finish out the story over this week.
  ```

  - u/Dragongeek:
    ```
    Honestly, I love Unsong, but the multi-POV and constant shifting between characters and timelines is by far the weakest aspect of the story.

    Like, I get there's a lot of story to tell, but a version that only focuses on Smith-Teller and the "main plot" is far more digestable than constant asides about a girl with her magic kayak that seem rather unconnected from the plot for quite a while.

  I read book 1 of the *Player Manager* LitRPG and I was unexpectedly blown away. 

  First of all, it's fascinating to read about a topic that the author is so clearly an expert in (soccer) despite me having basically no knowledge or real interest in the sport. Like, I know the rules and I'll watch the finals of the world cup if it's on but beyond that, I could not give two shits about the sport, the leagues, the players, etc. Despite this, the author managed to get me invested in the story they were telling and at the edge of my seat during certain climactic moments. 

  Secondly, it's not a power fantasty wish fulfillment story despite the protagonist essentially becoming an incarnated soccer god. The protagonist is, put bluntly, an idiot and an asshole. He constantly puts his foot in his mouth, tries to backpedal, and only makes it worse. Very much like Taylor in Worm, he's got a negative wisdom modifier, one thing he's good at (using superpowers), and would really be better off with a therapist. 

  Fortunately, one of the main arcs in book 1 is about him learning to be less of a dipshit, and the author does this in what feels like a very organic way. 

  For me, this book scratches several itches. It's got competence porn in a hyperspecific field of expertise, meaningful character development, and it's genuinely funny at some points. 

  Also, the audiobook (and the book generally) is British, which is fun to listen to when American English is my general standard.

    The [reviews](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/58187/player-manager-a-sports-progression-fantasy) are generally wild. Guess I should try it.

  - u/Gigapode:
    ```
    Seconded. Excellent fun and I had no real knowledge of football going into it either. 

    IMO there is some definite wish fulfillment, but I agree with the wisdom stat comparison and the author is an excellent writer, managing to keep things interesting despite the protagonist's magic football powers. 

    Such a funny and thrilling story about a sport I don't care about.

      >IMO there is some definite wish fulfillment

      The protagonist picking up chicks by nerding out about soccer so potently that it borders on philosophy was pretty awkward to read
      ```

      - u/Dragongeek:
        ```
        This is sorta explained by the fact that >!he is insanely physically attractive, and hot people play life on easy mode. A lot of his awkward behavior and people not kicking him out when they otherwise would is probably because of this, and people are willing to forgive a lot of quirks when you look like the god of athletics.!<
        ```

    - u/ReproachfulWombat:

      I wholeheartedly third this. One of the best technical writers on RR. There's a *depth* to his writing that still surprises me dozens of chapters in.

      I will say however, that despite the fact that the protagonist is a super-footballer, he's still playing in the... >!sixth league(?) after two full books. For people unfamiliar with English football, that means he's effectively still an amateur. If he wants to bring his team to the top of the premier league (the equivalent of the superbowl), even if he has a 100% win rate, it will take years (and another 40 books at this pace). You can only climb one league a season, and we haven't even finished the first one yet. !<

  Does anyone know of book where programmers or mathematicians revolutionize magic? I've read these ones but would like more

  - Magic 2.0 - Scott Meyer
  - The Incompleat Enchanter - L. Sprague de Camp
  - Wizard's Bane - Rick Cook
  ```

  - u/CellWithoutCulture:
    ```
    Answer from ChatGPT 4.0
    > 
    > Check out "Ra" by Sam Hughes. It blends magic and theoretical physics. Also, "Off to Be the Wizard" by Scott Meyer, if you haven't covered the entire series. These play on the intersection of tech and magic.
    > 
    > Context: In "Ra," magic is a branch of physics, and the protagonist is essentially a magic engineer. "Off to Be the Wizard" is part of the Magic 2.0 series and delves deeper into the mix of programming and magic.


    Any more?
    > 
    > "Sufficiently Advanced Magic" by Andrew Rowe is worth a look. Magic is systematized, and the protagonist is akin to an arcane researcher.
    > 
    > "Anathem" by Neal Stephenson also has elements of math and metaphysics, though not strictly magic.
    > 
    > "Flex" by Ferrett Steinmetz features 'mancers who use disciplines like videogaming and paperwork to cast spells.
    > 
    > Context: These novels further explore the concept of magic through systematic, often mathematical, lenses, appealing to a technically inclined audience.

    Which subreddit would be best for further discussion?

    > Try r/Fantasy for broad discussions or r/rational for stories that apply logical consistency like you prefer.

    > Context: r/Fantasy covers all types of fantasy literature, and you'll find many like-minded readers. r/rational is more niche and focuses on stories that employ rationalist principles, making it a good fit for your specific interest.

      Ra fits the bill and is pretty good, though might be one of the weaker works by Hughes, in my opinion, mostly because the mc makes annoying decisions. Other than that as usual for the author there is some cool worldbuilding slowly being revealed, and you can at least be assured that the questions being raised at the start (of which there are many) will get mostly satisfying answers. 

      Sufficiently advanced magic imo does not really fit the bill, and while it is not bad, it is a strange combination of progression fantasy, magic school, dungeon crawling and some weird theocratic politics. I bounced off at first, eventually finished everything that is out in the series (4 books), and am still not sure if I actually like it.

    Not exactly what you're looking for, but you might enjoy the novella [72 Letters](https://ia801600.us.archive.org/30/items/TedChiangSeventyTwoLetters/Ted_Chiang_72_Letters.pdf) by Ted Chiang.

  Does anyone have any recommendations for stuff like Nanocultivation? the mixture of philosophy, science fiction, and cultivation really worked for me-the book (at least the first one) really feels very unique. (Do note that if someone gets curious from this post, the series is discontinued, unfortunately.)
