  It's a fanfic in which Lio Shirazumi gets infected with Blacklight virus from prototype games. For maximum enjoyment you should probably read/watch Kara no Kyoukai first, but it's not required. All you need to know about Blacklight and Blackwatch you'll get from the story.

  High points include:

  * A believable explanation of how Blacklight actually works.
  * Main character using science to puzzle said explanation out.
  * Lio starts out mildly insane, as per canon, and gets more rational as the story progresses. Though it's kind of up in the air how much of Lio is even left by the last chapter. 
  * A teaser for a debate on the nature of embodied intelligence and personal identity between a blacklight runner and Touko Aozaki. The debate itself is not actually in the fic yet, but it will be in the future, I think. 

  This fic is not yet finished, but the 450 kilowords written are well worth a read. The characters are fleshed out, the the worldbuilding is thorough and the writing is competent.

    I really like this fic. Dullahan does a great job here. It is also possibly the longest work fitting into one calandar day in-story (I think second place is Ulysses at a 'mere' 265,000 words).  

    I'd recommend watching KnK over reading it - the adaptation is faithful, which is to say that in both many elements are severely unintelligible and weirdly unexplained while others are overexplained so the plot overall hangs together only if you don't look too hard, but the anime has a great Kalafina soundtrack and great aesthetics, while the light novel merely has a very mediocre translation; The anime shares the Hellsing Ultimate trait of having >50% of the images be suitably pretty to be desktop backgrounds. 

    The author's stuff he's working on currently to take a break from MiaL - One Week - is complete and utter nonsense unless you've absorbed way too much Nasu bullshit, but if you are in that demographic already (as I am...) it is fucking hilarious. Some of it is hilarious anyways, it has the very best Jenga game in all of fiction.

  It was a small thing compared to all the other good converstaions and parts in the fic, but I really liked how Lio points out the absurdities in everything.  He notices both the pun in his name and Araya's name and the fact that most magi actually understand the scientific method better than the average person.

  I also liked the character development of the various magi characters.

  This is really good, the ability to write prototype well is truly impressive, the consumption ability alone makes it far too OP for most writers. 

  Also can I just point out, this is over four hundred thousand words and the story has so far encompassed about a day. Really hoping for continuation soon.
