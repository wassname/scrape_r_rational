  Hector seems a little less bothered by the confirmation that Polarity is a CIA seed asset than I think, or at least hope, I would be. He seems to be suffering from a pretty heavy normalcy bias:

  "Oh, wow, that's weird. A super has suddenly showed up on my block without any public announcement that she's been assigned to a local super team. **Eh, she's probably here just to recuperate from that traumatic incident a few months back.**"

  "Oh, damn, that super who showed up on my block is a CIA seed asset. **Eh, she's probably not here for me, and even if she is, it could be months or years before she makes a move.**"

  I'm over exaggerating, but confirming that the CIA has planted an undercover asset *on your block* would seem to be the opportune time to trigger whatever evade or cover plan Hector has developed for such a situation, if any.

  Typo thread!

  >while a got out the ingrediants for omlettes. 

  "While I"

  >I glanced up as Polarity finished a sip from her mug,

  I hope this is Paris or I'm very confused

  Delphic is a superhero story about Hector, a young man in Detroit with the ability to see the past and the present. It follows his attempts to leverage this unusual ability to do good in the world while remaining behind the scenes, keeping both his identity and the truth of his powers secret from those who would see him as a threat.

  Story threads will focus on several characters as Hector encounters them:

  * Hector's sister, Paris, a homicide detective hiding her own power,
  * Doc Stevens, a disgraced scientist at the forefront of research on the source of super powers, and
  * The exploits of various "Super Teams": government-run groups of supers whose scope of operations have been steadily growing.
