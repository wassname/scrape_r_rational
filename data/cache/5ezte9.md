## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  You are an Aetherborn, a short-lived, genderless, empathic race from the world of Kaladesh, in Magic: The Gathering. You are born a fully-functional adult with a full grasp of language, and you have about two years to live before you crumble to dust. Your resources are as follows:

  * Empathy. You can feel the emotions of other nearby sapient beings as if they are your own. This cannot be used directly as a lie detector, but you can use it to extract information from people by asking them questions whose answers might change emotional states significantly.

  * You cannot eat and you do not sleep. You can smell.

  * You are born into an Aetherborn gang whose function is to create unique experiences for its members and produce enough profit to continue doing so into the future. You do not have any power in this gang currently, but nobody will come after you if you leave unless you try to betray the gang.

  * The leader of the gang is known to be able to drain life from other sapients to sustain themself. You do not know how many Aetherborn have this ability, or whether you do.

  What do?

    Hmmm, my knowledge on MtG is spotty, but using standard fantasy tropes:

    Any Always Evil races? Easy way to sustain leader and maybe yourself, to test it on them. 

    Use Empathy to pick out and only drain bad individuals, if possible and no always evils (and even there to check)

    Cities and urbanization are important because way more experiences happen in cities, so work in cities.

    Valuable as psychologists/interrogators, make yourself valuable enough to the military any racial prejudice is overcome.

      There are no Always Evil races on Kaladesh, though the Aetherborn themselves are the closest. They're really just terminally hedonistic party animals, and they don't particularly enjoy hurting others because they have to feel it themselves when they do.

      There isn't any obvious racism on Kaladesh. The five sapient species (humans, elves, dwarves, vedalken, aetherborn) generally all get along, at least in the largest city of Ghirapur. The government (Consulate) is fascist, but the 'racial' group it targets is mages. Some factions of the government want to exterminate mages, others just want to control and use them. At this point, there aren't many mages left, at least not openly in Ghirapur.

      Gaining access to and draining high-level Consulate officials would be fairly moral due to corruption and moral bankruptcy, but it wouldn't actually fix much because of the well-oiled meritocracy replacing the dead. Also, it's a pretty strong surveillance state, with autonomous spy drones everywhere. You would probably be caught eventually.

      There is an underground resistance to the Consulate, but their influence is limited, and not even they see a path to taking down the Consulate.

      Technological advancement on Kaladesh is quite high, with autonomous constructs doing a lot of the remaining work. Basically everyone appears to be some kind of inventor, receiving resources from the Consulate. 

      Actually, now that I think about it, I have no idea how Ghirapur's economy works. Presumably there's some kind of UBI or food welfare in place, because all jobs appear to flow from the Consulate and there just can't be enough of them to feed the entire city through capitalism. Healthcare is similarly unmentioned, though healers are one kind of mage the Consulate leaves alone.

        Ok, that makes it harder

        Death row/equivalent, maybe?

        Is there enough room for a cultural renaissance? Short lived hedonists tend to have a good advantage there.

        Similarly, pop stars that can read the crowd, or, for that matter, lawyers and politicians.

        Psionic diplomatic corps?

  Every time you have to take a piss, time slows down to 1/4 current speed for the whole world but you. Let's say there's a 1-10 need to pee scale, and this activates at 6 at minimum, wher 5 is feeling it, and 10 is wetting your pants. 

  How do you munchkin this?

  - u/Sparkwitch:

    Get a bladder fistula installed, then wear a catheter and a small pump. Cycle pee for unlimited time powers on demand.

    Warning: Pump may be unaffected by time powers and might need to perform faster than expected. Make speed adjustable.

  You stumble upon a piece of alien technology analogous to a Sith Holocron. With a few hours of dedicated mental effort akin to a trance, you can upload a copy of yourself into the device. This copy cannot be overwritten in the future; once used, the device is locked. You don't have to activate it immediately, if preparing yourself for the copying is important.

  Physically, the device is a silvery metal sphere about 15 centimetres in diameter weighing only 10 kg. It seems highly resistant to damage of all kinds. There are buttons on the front that you are able to guess mean "slow down", "pause", and "speed up".

  The device simulates you perfectly in a simulated environment, though simulated!you's body does not need sleep, food, or warmth, and cannot suffer damage from age or injury. Simulated!you is capable of sleeping, eating, and feeling warmth if the environment permits, though there are no physiological effects of these. Naturally, this means that you will quickly diverge, especially as the effects of age alter physical!you's body and mind.

  The only form of communication to or from the device is auditory. Specifically, the device transmits sound within an order of magnitude of human hearing frequency ranges from its environment to the simulated environment and vice versa. Simulated!you can still only hear what a healthy adult human would be able to hear.

  The device consumes 1 kilojoule of energy per simulated second. It will draw power from any connected electrical circuit, taking as much power as physically provided (up to however much it needs). It has no internal battery, and when unpowered it will not simulate any time (but will not lose the data).

  Physical!you is able to manipulate the time compression factor. Doing so also compresses the communicated sounds; at N&times; speed all external sounds are played at 1/N the frequency, and all internal sounds are emitted at N&times; the frequency.

  The simulated environment is by default very bland, though with some effort simulated!you can alter it in an impermanent way. It's sort of like a dream, with details slipping away when not consciously focussed on, only there's no details pulled from the subconscious like in a dream. Importantly, any things created in this way are sensory effects only with no intrinsic behaviour (i.e. an imagined computer only calculates as fast as simulated!you can imagine the answers and update the screen).

  You're fairly certain that a prolonged period of time in such an environment with no external communication would be deleterious to your mental health, though the rate of psychological damage would be difficult to determine. The experience would be closer to a sensory deprivation chamber than a deserted island, but what that means depends on you.

  The device is very, very illegal to own. You're not even meant to know it exists, and if certain secretive intergovernmental agencies that definitely don't exist were to catch you with it things would not go well for either copy of you.

  Theoretically, it doesn't have to be you that claims the device, but there's a lot of risk involved in either selling it or convincing somebody else to upload themselves into the device for your use. You may not even be able to prove it's real.

  Lastly, simulated!you is able to erase themselves if they wish. Doing so would not unlock the device for reuse.

    That's one creative torture box.

    It seems kind of hard to use effectively. The one-use limit means you can't get very creative with it, in particular. But mostly, the whole point of Holocrons is that they're loaded with extremely wise and knowledgeable masters, and useful to other people who need their forgotten secrets.

    What the box does is give you a personal advisor with a lot of time on their hands (especially with an accelerate function), which is pretty useful on its own. I'd still hesitate to use it, since it apparently means making a copy of yourself that will eventually go insane or commit suicide, and do nothing but serve you in the meantime.

      Theoretically you could have a symbiotic relationship with your simulation. It gives you advice, you give it entertainment and information.
      ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Yeeeeah, given your description I think the smartest move is probably "get rid of it." Simulated!you gets you no resources except time acceleration, and externally controlled acceleration at that. There's a chance you could use that to, say, make better decisions by giving a simulated version of you extra time to think, but that would be offset by the mental/emotional toll the setup takes on the simulated version -- you couldn't trust that what they come up with is really your best thinking. Meanwhile, you are torturing an apparently sentient simulation of yourself. Not good.

    IF you either have a VERY good memory or you changed the setup so there is a good way (like a functional computer they don't have to concentrate on) for simulated!you to store and revise data, you could use the box to work on, say, creative projects, music, novels, maybe some philosophical theory. Anything where the finished product can be conveyed into the real world by sound. But I don't think the system as presented would readily accommodate this, and it still has the moral issues with creating a sentient being just to use them and then leave them to torment and suicide.
    ```

    - u/Running_Ostrich:
      ```
      In theory, simulated!you could compose poems built with repetition, like the Iliad was, and then they wouldn't forget them. You'd probaby have to train with memorization techniques quite a bit before you could get it to work though.
      ```

  - u/ZeroNihilist:

    I don't know whether it's considered kosher to respond to your own prompt, but I had an idea about how this could go and wanted to share.

    First, establish limits on time compression. Since input and output is bounded by human hearing (for the purposes of this, human hearing is in the range 20 Hz to 20 kHz), you get limits on communication at high or low compression factors. 

    In terms of human-human communication, you're probably limited to a compression factor of less than 5. Even though the frequencies will still be within human hearing range at that point, a 5&times; compression makes it way too fast even for exaggeratedly slow speech.

    However, you aren't limited solely to human-human communication. You can probably get your hands on a microphone able to pick up the 20 Hz to 20 kHz range, and you can use a computer to slow down the speech enough to be intelligible. You can also do the reverse. This means that you could use a computer as an intermediary in a conversation even at relatively high compression (up to about 50&times;, depending on your vocal range, though if your simulation can work out how to make artificial speech sounds it could work up to 1,000&times;).

    You may run into hardware limits, which you'd probably have to determine experimentally. Assume that your maximum is only 100&times;, which is still incredibly fast (a year every 3.65 days, plus no need to sleep or eat). At such a rate of compression, the device consumes 100 kW of power, which would pretty quickly become noticeable—an average house uses around 6,000 kWh a month, where this device alone would use 72,000 kWh at that speed.

    Of course, when compressed you'd find that your simulation would go insane pretty quickly. You'd need to facilitate entertainment for it. Why not set the computer up to respond to commands from the simulation? Given a hard-drive full of audiobooks, music, podcasts, radio broadcasts, etc. you could let your simulation entertain themselves with vocal instructions.

    Then you could set up the computer to push the compression buttons (within preset safe limits). Run out of books to read? Pause the simulation (with hourly automatic unpauses, to prevent accidental permanent pausing) until the physical you can provide some more. Need to do something IO-bounded, like talk to a human or use the internet? Slow yourself down.

    In the long-term, your simulated self may even be able to design a body for themselves. At a high rate of compression, the lack of vision may be able to be circumvented, especially with self-navigating technology. Whether you let them have this body is another matter; you might feel squeamish even giving them access to the internet.

      A simulated me is *definitely* getting voice-activated internet access. In fact, I'd set up the voice-activated Internet access *before* copying the simulation.

      Hmmm... if the simulated me is designing a robot body, then it doesn't need to be anything like my actual body. I'm thinking a three-wheeled torso will be easier to work with than trying to balance while walking on actual legs.

      Does it need to actually be plugged in to draw power, or can it draw power from nearby circuits via induction?

  You have the ability to make anyone believe any lie you say. You have to be physically present (recordings don't work) and you only have to be understood for it to work. In other words, ear plugs might act as a good defense, but if the victims can read your lips or understands your gestures, the effect will still work. You also have to be careful with what you say because you can't turn it off. You will automatically believe any lie you tell to yourself, so your mental state can deteriorate if you don't use it wisely. Oh, and it doesn't necessarily have to be a lie, only something the user believes to be false.

  This is something I'm planning for a villain in future arc of my story. I think it'd be cool to see if you guys come up with cool uses. One more thing, just cause the recipient believes everything you say to them doesn't mean that they'll do what you expect them to. Example: If you tell someone you're attracted to that you're the only person on the planet that will love them, the victim might commit suicide out of despair.

  So, there's the obvious "take over the world" plan with this, but what else would you do?  Also, how would you beat someone like this?

    This sounds like code geass towards the end. Not much you can do about it. 
    If you play intelligently with your wording you just win. 
    "Your main goal in life is to produce a utopia and keep me alive and happy" say this to everyone you meet. You're unlikely to get attacked by he other side of the world if you travel and take over world leaders proactively. In addition you lie to yourself so that you are always at least slightly happy. Then you get your utopia set up and tell everyone they are happy. Gg

    Does "believe a lie" also imply believing all the logical consequences of that lie?  Alternately, does it imply "believing the logical consequences of the lie, insofar as the target normally believes in logical consequences of his ideas"?  If the latter, note that people are very inconsistent and that by itself could make the power not seem to work at times.

    Also, a question a little similar to the logical consequences one: exactly how is the lie fit into the  target's preexisting worldview?  For instance, what happens if you tell someone "the world is flat" but he already has travelled around the world and knows that when it's day here it's night on the other side.  Does he then come up with a whole bunch of rationalizations about how the conspiracy put up a special sunlight filter to make it night in some places and day in others?  Or does he just hold the inconsistent belief set "time zones prove the world is round", "there are time zones", and "the world isn't round"?

    Hove you read [Book Series](#s "The Dagger and Coin series (starting with the Dragon's Path) by Daniel Abraham")?  That series has a similar power, but limited to hearing, can be increased/decreased at will (but not turned off), and also works on statements the speaker believes to be true.  

    >You also have to be careful with what you say because you can't turn it off. You will automatically believe any lie you tell to yourself...

    If you're a government, you can detect them by having checkpoints scattered around that require a person to tell a specific lie to the guard.  If the guard believes them, they get arrested, if not, they go free.

    As an individual, it would be much, much more difficult.  They could persuade you to let them go ("These aren't the droids you're looking for"), but that would run the risk of the speaker believing that nobody was looking for them.

    If the effect works on me, I'll probably quickly become unstable and lose connection with reality.  Everyone lies to themselves, but most of us don't believe the self-lies.

    In the worst case scenario, imagine this.  A remote-controlled robot that is chasing me has me cornered at the top of a tall building.  The next building is twenty feet away, and twenty feet down.

    I have a choice.  Surrender or try to jump to the next building.  I'm no athlete but I still say to myself "I can make it."

    I just lied to myself, and now I believe it, so I jump.  *splat*

  Ok so it's the late 60's and superpowers have recently arisen.                        
  You are one of the few genius god tier superhumans and one of only a few that retained interest in affecting the world. You have pretty substantial political influence among the western powers. This is because you can influence people's brains, but not _too_ greatly; as you don't know more about neurology than we do nowadays. Plus you can tell a considerable amount from observing people's brain states with your powers, again limited by knowledge of neurology. In addition you can do things like split your mind into a multitude of copies of yourself and spend months deliberating within your own mind in a simulated environment in order to come to a decision, all in the middle of a conversation.                   
  All in all, you could easily become the leader of your home western country and are possibly the most influential political figure in the world.

  Now it has recently become clear that level of education (especially regarding logic) and intelligence are extremely strongly correlated with developing superhuman abilities. So given the possession of superhumans is a staggering military advantage (and they can be used for unofficial attacks on the enemy while maintaining plausible deniability), you can probably get western powers to agree to somewhat extreme measures in the name of getting an advantage.                 

  So effectively this question boils down to _how do you rapidly increase the intelligence and sanity waterlevel of western powers, as part of an intelligence military arms race?_                    
  Bonus points for info about how that kind of rapid increase in competence would affect a nations culture.
