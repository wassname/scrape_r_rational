  Could someone give me the pitch for this? i.e. the "This is why you, /r/rational reader should read this story!"
  ```

  - u/PlaneOfInfiniteCats:

    I personally did not like this story much. I found it really similar to wuxia.

    Sure, it's a deconstruction of many common fantasy tropes. The humour is okay sometimes. But protagonist has severe psychological issues (I'd even call him literally insane), the world at least partially runs on narrativium, and characters use an ability to detect if somebody is telling the truth (you know, not what the speaker believes to be truth, but *truth* truth) as a lie detector instead of an Oracle it is.
    ```

      > and characters use an ability to detect if somebody is telling the truth (you know, not what the speaker believes to be truth, but truth truth) as a lie detector instead of an Oracle it is.

      Where did you get that from? If memory serves, at one point the detector even fails because Colin was saying something that was true, but that he wasn't really convinced of himself.
      ```

      - u/PlaneOfInfiniteCats:
        ```
        > “Your ability, it allows you to tell when someone’s lying.”

        > “Yes.”

        > “Even if they believe what they’re saying, you can still tell when their belief is incorrect.”

        > “Yes.”

        Here character clearly tells that he is able to detect if someone is telling the truth.
        Yes, the Oracle might be slightly awkward and inconvenient to use, but it is still a fully functioning Oracle, and with an Oracle you can win everything everywhere forever if you manage to ask a correct question. And you can even ask an Oracle to *tell* you the correct question.

        EDIT (clarification): I don't say that I am necessarily correct and this definitely is an Oracle. I am just saying that when you encounter something that looks like an Oracle at first glance, you really should drop everything and *check if what looks like an Oracle is indeed an Oracle* because if it is, you just won everything everywhere forever. My issue here is that nobody as much as raised a brow when they encountered a potential Oracle. Compare with [HPMOR chapter 17 spoiler](#s "Harry getting a Time Turner, immediately trying to use it to solve P=NP, and getting a negative result. Sure, he failed, but he immediately noticed a possible exploit and checked for its existence. ") Colin, on the other hand, just ignores the truth-telling thing altogether.
        ```

        - u/mooderino:
          ```
          I think a lot of people misunderstood how God (the truth teller) worked. Mainly by rushing to interpret it in the way they found most convenient.

          They seemed to assume if you just made any statement he would be able to verify it for you.

          As though if I said, the man who killed JFK's name begins with A. B? C? and by a process of elimination work out the identity. It doesn't work like that.

          In addition, God doesn't have to answer any question he doesn't feel like.

          I had a lot of people assuming how it worked, convincing themselves their assumptions were facts, and then throwing these 'facts' at me as proof of whatever theory they had come up with. 

          I intentionally made it confusing (and also left myself enough wiggle room with areas not explained) exactly because it wasn't to be used as an all knowing oracle. If none of the readers understand how it works, how do you expect Colin to? Especially when his first experience of it is breaking it.

          It's also mentioned that the truth telling part isn't what God uses his  powers for, it's just a side-effect.

          Anyway, those were my thoughts when writing it. It's not that I'm unaware of the power of an oracle, it's that I tend to only use OP things in a way that isn't helpful or makes things worse.
          ```

            You completely misinterpreted my objection.
            The issue I have with the God (and the zone-of-truth later) is not that I "assumed how it worked". No, the issue is: When protagonist with head full of concepts from modern society, while in new and unusual land of wonders, encounters something that to him looks kinda like Grand Cosmic Power That Would Let Him Win Everything Everywhere Forever, he should not ignore it. He should do at least cursory check, because if it is in fact Grand Cosmic Power, he will win right now. Again, look how it was done in [HPMOR ch. 17 spoiler](#s "Harry's interaction with Time Turner. It was not kept vague. It was not ignored. Once protagonist noticed something that could potentially be global universal victory device, he immediately tried to test it. He failed and knew that what looked as the victory device, in fact, wasn't. But he did not ignore it."). 

            > I intentionally made it confusing (and also left myself enough wiggle room with areas not explained) exactly because it wasn't to be used as an all knowing oracle. If none of the readers understand how it works, how do you expect Colin to? Especially when his first experience of it is breaking it.

            This just makes it worse. I treat such "wiggle room" as sloppiness. Also, Colin, unlike the readers, really could at least *try* to find out more about the truth-finding methods. He didn't even try, that's what bothered me.

            > It's also mentioned that the truth telling part isn't what God uses his powers for, it's just a side-effect.

            It doesn't matter if world domination is just a side effect, it's still world domination.


            Also, I'd like to use this rare possibility to converse with an actual author to leave my review:
            I personally didn't like the work. The main character, with his insanity, Irresponsible-Captain-Tailor-grade luck and inconsistent stupidity was really unlikable. He is well written, but I really didn't like reading about him. About the only three things I enjoyed out of 131 chapters were unusual rabbits, tsundere princess and ninja Ayanami Rei. It might be that I'm just not an intended audience for your work, but I can't honestly recommend it. Sorry.
            ```

            - u/mooderino:
              ```
              "encounters something that to him looks kinda like Grand Cosmic Power That Would Let Him Win Everything Everywhere Forever"

              This is an example of you assuming how it works. That's how you see it, not how Colin sees it. He has always looked at things in a way different to other people. I understand the frustration if you personally wouldn't do it that way, or think something is so obvious as to be undeniable, but it's always been written as the reader seeing things from Colin's somewhat odd perspective, not Colin doing what most people would do.

              "It doesn't matter if world domination is just a side effect, it's still world domination."

              Here's an example of creating a 'fact' and then using it as an argument against me. I didn't say his side-effect was world domination. You decided truth telling=world domination when I already stated it doesn't work like that. I get a lot of this kind of straw man argument.

              By the way, I'm no trying to have a go at you, I like conversing with my readers (not as rare as you might think, I tend to answer most queries on Reddit and other forums) but I get a lot of people coming at me with very stridently held beliefs about what Colin should or shouldn't do. I mean really strident.

              One reviewer on WFG insisted the people arriving in this world would have created electricity and gunpowder (not could have, definitely would have) and gave the story 2/5 stars because of this obvious and massive error. They offered to amend this score once I fixed things. Do they expect me to turn my story from fantasy to steampunk just to please one person? (Answer: Yes).

              As for leaving me your review, I'm not sure why you feel the need to tell me that directly. Wouldn't it be better to just stop reading? After 133 chapters I doubt I will suddenly change my writing style.
              ```

  - u/AurelianoTampa:
    ```
    The story is entertaining. It is not, IMO, particularly rational (though Colin is less driven by tropes and stereotypes than most fantasy protagonists), but there are a fair number of creative solutions he comes up with to solve problems.

    I have some issues with the characters themselves and have mentioned them before in previous threads here. But in the end I found the story more entertaining than abrasive. I'd recommend it, with the caveat that the humor isn't for everyone, and that it is more a deconstruction of fantasy tropes than an actual rational work.

    To the author: I just caught up with the last several chapters. Really enjoyed the end of book 4 and am intrigued by the beginning of book five. Thank you and keep up the good work!
