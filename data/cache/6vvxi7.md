  Kind of. It definitely has rational elements, and it certainly tries to be one. But a lot of it is lost in the moral morass of Social Justice. I'll spoiler it just to be sure, but the MC sits down and tries to figure out how to most effectively use her power for good, and ends up [tag](#s " organizing a women's shelter, I think.") What's rational about that? She doesn't munchkin her unique advantage of superpowers at all, instead it's only relevant to the extent that it allows people to complain about how privileged she is. If she were rational, she would get involved in politics or something instead.

  Also, again as a result of the SJ overtones: There's a very creepy bit where one of the female 'heroes' [tag](#s " stalks people accused of rape, hunts them while invisible and stabs them to death in as torturous a way as possible, which is of course cheered on as being super feminist by some in the comments.") Seriously, that sort of thing creeps me out, and it's totally anethema to what rationality is about. 


  Edit: Please note that the above criticism does not take away from the fact that the comic is very well made and engaging - I still read it in its entirety, after all!

    I agree that the organization she ends up building is not the highest-utility application of superpowers, but I also don't think it was supposed to be. I think it's meant to be a critical stage in her development, but not her "final form." The "rational" aspect of it is her realization that she can accomplish her goals more effectively by networking with other capes, rather than by trying to independently punch the world's problems to death with a powerset that's not really equipped for effecting large-scale change. She has a long way to go, but she's making progress by correcting that flaw in her approach. 

    The actions of the character you refer to in the second paragraph are certainly disturbing, but they are not portrayed as heroic in the narrative. They're a reaction to a systemic injustice, sure, but a misguided and self-defeating one. That character is the *antagonist* of her chapter; she's not portrayed as a wholly unsympathetic sadistic cartoon of a villain, but SFP's antagonists rarely are. She comes across as a foil to the protagonist, an example of what she might become if she gives in to her impulse to solve problems with violence.

    I think it's a good thing she doesn't go into politics. Having popularity is one thing, but using it correctly requires a very different set of skills and talents that she doesn't appear to have. She would be eaten alive buy the guys she can't even hit in response.
    ```

    - u/CeruleanTresses:
      ```
      Excellent point. I think [spoiler](#s "the "Max Incident" is a great example of how she ends up having to resort to violence *because* she sucks at political skills like negotiating. It does seem like she's since recognized how that deficiency limited her options to ones she found repugnant,") so I hope to see her taking steps to build those skills.

    Actually, that is a deconstruction of the entire justification of *having* vigilantes. 
    Rape has two characteristics which makes it unusual as crimes go.

    1: The recidivism rate is very, very high. Rapists are rare, but rape is common, because rapists re-offend over, and over and over. Rapists stop when they are stopped, and not before. 

    2: The conviction and apprehension rate is abysmal. The formal legal system does a really shitty job of fighting rape, and will often put the victim through hell in the process. 

    Therefore, if vigilantism is ever justified, it would be against rapists, and it is perfectly logical that in a world with capes, one of them would embark on that crusade. It is really hard to argue against it without completely de-legitimizing caping full-stop. Which is the authors point. 
     Beating up drug-dealers and muggers does not address any social problem which the formal justice system fails at. The cops are, in fact, pretty good at that job.   

    Uhm. Now I kind of want to write a story about an oracle-expy that goes after financial sector criminals... Who also reoffend a lot and dont serve time very often.

      Ok, that all sounds fair enough, but that's not really what's bothering me. There are plenty of stories where heroes do violent or evil things, but it's not an issue because the reader is expected to understand that you can't solve the world's problems that way. 

      It's the fetishization of violence against the dirty mongrel enemy that disturbs me. Especially when combined with the trope that these evil mysterious creatures are widespread on e.g. college campuses, and could be anywhere amongst us.

      Or to interpret it more charitably: That particular character is presented as a pitfall that the social justice activist is not to fall into - but the line is drawn precisely at deliberate torture and murder of an otherwise deserving enemy, *not* at the idea of treating fellow college students as being potential monsters deserving of death in the first place.
      ```

      - u/CeruleanTresses:
        ```
        I didn't really get the impression that the comic was fetishizing the violence. The character made spectacular displays of violence and torture because she wanted to make her motives obvious and inspire fear among her target demographic--not because the readers were supposed to be like "nice". Speaking only for myself, even though I despised her victims for their crimes and believed they deserved punishment, the brutal nature of their deaths made me feel uncomfortable pangs of sympathy for them--not triumph or gleeful satisfaction. 

        I know fiction has a fine line to walk between simply showing extreme violence and gratuitously reveling in it, but I don't feel that this story crossed that line. That might just be my own opinion though.

        As for the trope that rapists could be anywhere among us...well, they could be and they are. They're rare, but they don't wear an identifying facial brand or anything.

          >As for the trope that rapists could be anywhere among us...well, they could be and they are. 

          It's also true that rapists could be anywhere among groups of black people just like they could be anywhere on college campuses.  But if she was stalking black people for this purpose, we would see a lot of objection.

          Going after a particular group implies that that group is particularly dangerous, above and beyond the fact that there is danger everywhere.

            I don't recall anything in the comic stating that she was specifically hunting white people. The victims we saw just happened to be white (I think, I forget if there were any POC in the military group). I suspect her victims may be disproportionately white because she's specifically hunting rapists who have already escaped conventional justice.

                Ah, gotcha--but she wasn't specifically hunting college students either. She killed an old married dude and a bunch of ex-military, too, and she was vetting the fire guy as a possible victim.

                    Offscreen, I don't know--she had apparently been killing for a while before she "stopped making them look like accidents". I'm not aware that she was intentionally *excluding* women as possible targets; she might have been, but I don't think she ever says so explicitly. We don't actually see her kill any women, probably because rapists are mostly men. (She does try to kill the female main character at one point, not for raping anyone but just to get her off her back.)

                    She does say that the victims of the rapists she killed were "women, mostly women, but men as well, and kids." I found one example of her referring to her targets as "guys," so it's probable that they have been overwhelmingly or exclusively male.

                      It's just one thing that kind of bothers me with SFP. I'm not exactly opposed to the SJ themes, but if we're looking at creating awareness, a lot of domestic abuse victims are men. Like, 40%. And a vast, vast majority of abuse *shelters* are for women - way out of proportion with the abuse statistics. SFP organizes a women's abuse program, I think, when a program to support and protect *everyone* would do more to break down the perceived line between men and women. 

                      It's a theme that SFP doesn't seem to touch on very much. In its effort to focus on the strong female, it forgets about the weak male. Or that's what I think, anyway - I could be wrong?

        @Sophronius

        I really don't understand how that was what you took away from SFP. The whole "are regular people good or evil" question is as old as dirt and it's not entirely obvious to everyone what the actual answer is because there is evidence for both sides. Also, serial killers ARE people too, and not all of them are psychopaths. In the story the reason the main character even felt an impulse to kill all those bystanders at all was because she felt like they were threatening the life of one of her best friends by inciting violence against her. 

        SFP is NOT a fic for social justice warrior ideology, it's a fic for social justice. If you cannot see the difference between these two things then you've been fooled by SJW ideology just as much as any true believer.
        ```

        - u/Sophronius:
          ```
          Hey Vulcan. My impression might be partly coloured by reading the comments to those sections and being particularly dismayed by them. I'll agree with you that SFP is much more even-handed than most SJ stories, and the protagonist does try to be a reasonable and decent human being, which is great. And I do think the story is good and well written.

          However, the underlying assumptions of SJ ideology still shines through. What we have here is a character [tag](#s " who is a POC shown stabbing white rapists in an extremely sadistic manner"), and the protagonist going "You know I can totally see where you're coming from but violence is not the solution." Imagine, instead, if a white character were shown killing POCs and another white character had that as a reaction. Would that seem reasonable to you? 

          As @CeruleanTresses put it, this antagonist is put up as a foil to the protagonist - someone who the protagonist could potentially become. It's something meant to inspire the audience to think and go "Huh, do I agree or disagree with this?" However in doing so it places the Overton window to the extreme left, and anchors you to consider anything less extreme than that as normal.

          By contrast, look at how the MCs most controversial action is treated. She... bent a libertarian's arm once. That's all she did, and everyone lost their shit. She couldn't sleep, and literally threw up in disgust of herself. People in the audience reviled her for it. Seriously, I mean, what?

          Does it not cause any moral dissonance in you, to see these two completely different actions treated in such a completely perverse way?

            FUCK that was so frustrating. [spoilers and ranting](#s "To this day people are still like "oohhhh, the poor libertarian, he did nothing wrong except try to use the slow unnecessary deaths of potentially millions of people to stick it to his ex." Like just because the use of his powers is a matter of bodily autonomy somehow means he's not an abhorrent piece of shit. Like his suffering is the only suffering that matters because they know his face and name, and the millions of people who won't die of organ failure and blood loss now are just an undifferentiated mass. And some of them are still complaining that the fiery hand of God hasn't come down to slap Alison yet, because they apparently can't tolerate any moral ambiguity whatsoever, and if the comic doesn't make a clear value judgment that Alison should burn in hell for twisting a dude's arm then it sucks. As if this comic has ever been about Aesops and not about exploring philosophical dilemmas! As if the fact that Alison faces little chance of retribution for anything she does, and therefore has no "safety net" outside her own conscience if she slides into well-intentioned villainy, weren't half the point of the comic! And also apparently twisting that arm was the worst thing she's ever done, even though she punched a guy to death a few issues ago and also killed a lot of bystanders as collateral damage during her superhero career.")

            Of course there were plenty of people taking the opposite side too. But I guess the lesson here is to keep the comments section well divorced in our minds from the actual story, because there's always going to be some real infuriating shit in there.

            I will say I don't really see much celebration of that other character's actions these days. The readership seems to largely agree that she was wrong. I think the composition of the audience might just have been different at the time those pages were posted. 

            I suspect that there's not much crossover between "people who think the other character's actions were good" and "people who think Alison's actions were evil." A lot of the "Alison is evil" rhetoric I've seen has gone so far as to accuse those who *don't* condemn her of being social justice warriors, for defending the "torture" of a cishet white man.

            Honestly I think you are probably noticing your own confusion somewhere in your mind and then ignoring it. You think reading the comments MIGHT have biased you? I think if you're even worrying about that at all then you should steelman the hell out of that. Honestly, wanting and threatening to kill the angry mob that is trying to incite violence against one of your best friends is wrong, but it's not unprovoked like twisting a random guy's arm AND kidnapping him in order to save one of your best friends from endless torment. While the latter is more defensible from a utilitarian stand point, it isn't as relatable to the emotions of humans who don't intuitively understand scope. I will repeat myself: By treating social justice and social justice warrior ideology as equivalent, you are letting yourself be fooled by social justice warrior ideology just as much as any true believer, and in the process seriously misrepresenting a great work of literature. REVERSED STUPIDITY IS NOT INTELLIGENCE.

            Also I would like to add that i myself am an aspiring rationalist and I am also a big fan of SFP and do not think any more highly of the SJW movement then you do

              I'm not denying that I have my biases, but I think I'm more aware of them than that, Vulcan. I very much appreciate the difference between social justice and SJWs (note I never used the term SJW in my comments) and am grateful for anyone who is still capable in this day and age of making their arguments in a reasonable and rational manner, which clearly includes the authors of this very well-made comic! Nevertheless I still take issue with some of their object-level beliefs (which I'll agree I could have steel-manned better).

              Regarding those object level beliefs: You seem to be referring to the case where the MC got angry at the mob that threatened Feral. I haven't discussed this issue (I was talking about Moonshadow) but I found that to be totally reasonable and understandable, and don't blame the MC for killing that one person in the slightest. The thing that made me uncomfortable was the disturbing torture-fantasy played out against suspected rapists, which I don't think is unreasonable. 

              Anyway, I remember you liking my story, Scar's Samsara, which also touches upon some issues of social justice. Surely I wouldn't be able to write about that in a favourable light if I were "fooled as much as any true believer"? 

              Edit: I have added a disclaimer to my OP to make it clear that I'm not just bashing the comic.

      Rape has a third characteristic: It has a high false accusation rate, and the fact that it may not leave evidence (especially when there is dispute over whether someone consented) makes it convenient to use for false accusations.  And that characteristic makes vigilante justice against accused rapists particularly bad compared to vigilante justice against other crimes.
      ```

      - u/CeruleanTresses:
        ```
        Do you have a source on that? Everything I've read says that the false accusation rate for rape is roughly the same as the false accusation rate for other crimes. I'm pretty sure the false accusation for rape only appears to be higher if you assume that all acquittals and dismissed cases were false accusations--which of course is an unjustifiable assumption, since there frequently isn't enough evidence to convict in cases of actual rape.
        ```

        - u/None:
          ```
          It's hard to get accurate numbers in this, considering rape is viewed as such a "special evil" in society (even though it is at worst a violent assault, but that's another conversation). Being accused of rape will turn the angry mob loose almost instantly, and they'll be out for blood, truth be damned. 

          I mean, you yourself said in another comment in this thread that "victims" (not alleged, but "victims") go "through hell" when they are part of an investigation of an alleged rape, a statement you're very unlikely to make for any other crime investigation where the victim must testify. If we're already ascribing some sort of special consideration for alleged victims, the reporting skews. Add in the absolute madness of post-hookup regret being spun into rape allegations, and the numbers skew even more, especially with the modern SocJus "listen and believe" ideology. 

          We'd likely have much better numbers for rape if people didn't think of rape as the "worst thing ever" (which is patently absurd, since murder is the worst thing ever. You can recover from rape, but murder is forever.), and just lumped it in with severe assault/battery of a non-sexual nature.

            You are talking to two people here. 
            And, frankly, go watch court tv. Most rapes dont go to court because women damn well know the defense council will try to make them out to be a lying slut. In front of a room full of people.

             That is an extremely unpleasant experience. The police very frequently do the same thing before things go to court. And every woman on earth knows this is what happens. Nobody sane files those charges without cause. 

            Apply some theory of mind. Would it be worth it to you? No? I did not think so. There is no emotional payoff to sending an innocent to jail, and there certainly is no hope of reputational or financial gain either. 
             The entire reason this is a common perception is due to adversarial courts. The only defense against a testimony of rape is to undermine the credibility of the witness, and therefore approximately all* rape cases end up including a false accusation of perjury. 

            *Not saying it never happens. Some people are, after all, insane to very high degrees. But to suppose it is common is laughable.

            The only reason women elect to go through with pressing charges is a desire for justice and the fact that - as I said, rapists reoffend. A lot.
             So getting the guy who assaulted you off the street is vital for the safety of all your friends. 

            Are you unhappy women tend to view you as a potential predator? That is fair. The large dollop of fear which taints a lot of heterosexual dating is not pleasant.   Lending camouflage to the actual predators out there is, however, not helpful.

              My objective here is to maintain a rational perspective, for the record. I'm not taking a stance on this issue yet.

              > And, frankly, go watch court tv.

              I'm not American and I couldn't find much information on court TV - just something about how truTV used to be called Court TV. 

              But is television really a good source? There's an inherent bias here - any material that's worth being televised must have a story. It's hardly going to show you the boring court cases, or the court cases where nothing really happens, or the court cases where it turns out someone was lying all along. 

              > Most rapes dont go to court because women damn well know the defense council will try to make them out to be a lying slut.

              Is this what happens? I'm honestly asking. The defense council's job is to present a defense. Whatever defense they present must be supported with evidence. 

              Or rather, what I'm asking is, what exactly does the defense council do? If they're presenting the possibility that the woman may have lied, that's what they're supposed to do. If they deliberately belittle and try an emotional argument to make the woman seem like a lying slut, then that's awful. But the two are very different things and deserve a distinction.

              > The police very frequently do the same thing before things go to court. And every woman on earth knows this is what happens. 

              Do they? Again, it's important to draw a line between trying to establish the facts of the case and actually shaming the victim. Why and how is this established as a fact? I'm sure there are policemen that are awful about it, but I'm equally sure that there are policemen that are sensitive about the subject. It's a traumatic thing.

              > Nobody sane files those charges without cause. Apply some theory of mind. Would it be worth it to you? No? I did not think so. 

              I don't think this is a rational argument. Someone who makes a false accusation is a criminal to begin with - they've clearly already thought it through and decided it's worth it. Applying the average person's mindset to it is like asking the average person if stealing or murder would be worth it - most people would say no, because most sane people aren't criminals.

              There are examples of women who falsely accuse others, including one who falsely accused fifteen men. I don't have the source with me at the moment since I'm stuck on mobile, but I'd be happy to get some sources if you'd like to continue this discussion.

              Somewhat more horrifyingly, there's also precedent of false memories being created by unethical therapists or psychologists. This is perhaps the worse case of all - the trauma is real, and the victim certainly believes it's real, but the perpetrator is still innocent. I believe the study done for false memories was a female scientist. Again, I'll grab the sources if you'd like to make this a discussion. 

              > The only reason women elect to go through with pressing charges is a desire for justice and the fact that - as I said, rapists reoffend.

              Well, yes, and it's very brave for the victims to do so. That's why false accusers are so bad - they undermine the real victims. 

              There's one thing I'm genuinely curious about, and it's the clear difference in cultural perspective between me and a lot of others. I live in a very safe country; we have one of the lowest crime rates in the world. I can't conceive of policemen or courts deliberately making fun of and/or putting down victims.

              But my question is - how much of that is an exaggeration? Because remember, there's a cognitive bias in  place here. Negative memories are a lot more prominent than positive ones, and negative news tends to be a lot more lucrative. If a victim is treated correctly through the court procedures, there's nothing to write about. So you only really hear about it when things go wrong. 

              Which is to say, how much is the media a reflection of your society, really?

              1) You're forgetting that about 40 percent of rape victims are male, and assuming your hypothetical alleges victim is a poor innocent woman being slighted by the big bad justice system, when in practice it's male victims who are told that they were "lucky" or they should have enjoyed it, and female victims that are rushed for rape kit testing and supported by every swinging dick (outside of situations of judicial incompetence, which is an admittedly common problem in certain jurisdictions). 

              2) You're assuming a much higher degree of mental competence and sanity then what they actually possess from people who file false rape allegations. 

              3) Are we celebrating perpetuating harmful gender stereotypes now? A random woman on the street should no more assume that every man around her is a potential rapist then a random man should assume a woman in a short skirt is a slut.

      I don't see how your arguments justify vigilantism in this case. From what I understand there is still little or no evidence that the vigilante bases their decision on. Your latter example of financial crimes seems like a much better candidate to me because there's WAY more likely to be a concrete trail of evidence that the justice system missed and/or covered up.

      - u/CeruleanTresses:

        I think their point isn't necessarily that vigilantism is ever justified, but that killing rapists is sort of a steelman for vigilantism. Like, if it's not justifiable to be a vigilante who kills rapists, how is it justifiable to be a vigilante who kills [insert socially acceptable target for vigilantism here]? 

        The idea that only some applications of violence--specifically, those that defend against threats to the status quo--are seen as acceptable/admirable is a major theme of that arc. The vigilante says it herself: "You killed so many innocent bystanders [as a superhero], and it was all okay...You ever see a soldier get called a serial killer?
        ....They're trying to tell people that I'm fighting the wrong war." 

        Basically, she's arguing that society has shown it has no objection to her *methods,* so the problem must be with her *targets.* Hence the deconstruction of superheroes as a concept: The reader, faced with this apparent hypocrisy, has to decide whether the answer is "it should also be okay to murder rapists" or "it shouldn't be okay to murder anyone."

        Actually, an anti-financial-criminal vigilante could probably fill a similar philosophical niche. It just wouldn't be as compelling of a story, because most readers wouldn't have the same visceral reaction to a financial criminal as to a rapist.

        Re: evidence, the vigilante in this case does go to great lengths to confirm to her satisfaction that the rapists are guilty. Most of that happens offscreen, of course, so it's hard to say exactly what her standards for evidence were. But it's made clear that this is *extremely* important to her--her own rationalizations for the murders absolutely depend on her believing she's done her due diligence.

        It... Doesn´t? SFP is a deconstruction / "reality ensues" story of superheroing, it includes this particular rampage against crime as a refutation of the value of superheroes through a steel-man argument. That is, someone going after rapists is one of the things that would happen in a world of capes, because it is the strongest argument *for* vigilantism and it is still not okay. 

        She does, in fact have one piece of evidence noone else gets, though. That is, they did not just report this case to the courts, when that failed, they vent to her. And she is fucking terrifying. 

        A hacker tearing through the one percent of lawbreakers wouldn´t serve that purpose, tough it probably would be really appealing vengeance/wish-fulfillment porn for.. just about everyone. Uhm..

      >rape is common

      No. It's not. If those fake numbers about 1 in 5 or 1 in 4 or however many women in college supposedly get raped were anywhere close to true, no sane parents would send their daughters to college and no sane woman would go.

    I love the comic and also actually totally agree with you about Valkyrie.  

    ...EXCEPT: why is *getting involved in politics* your alternative?  Assuming you mean liberal politics, that doesn't leverage her superpowers except insofar as they make her a celebrity (granted, the BIGGEST superpower in American politics apparently), which is an advantage they also bring to Valkyrie.  But the political system in America is DESIGNED, admirably, to make "politician" not much of a munchkin job (if it were, Indian Quirrell's assessment of munchkinry as a "tyrant"'s mindset gets really literal).  Most politicians, even popular ones (a useful quality for winning elections and jack shit else), do not accomplish anywhere near as much as Valkyrie could if well-organized and successful.  And there's no indication that her powers OR personality are optimized for politics at ALL - if anything, the opposite - whereas Valkyrie at least does draw on skills (organizing a cape team) she already has.

    On the first point, I think the idea in the story for the reason she doesn't munchkin her powers is that they really aren't useful for anything.  Low-grade Superman powers are pretty meh.  She'll probably go into politics eventually, but she is pretty young.

    On the second, I think that isn't supposed to be a good thing.  The author is exploring the idea that giving out superpowers to people from underprivileged groups will obviously upset power structures.
    ```

    - u/Sophronius:
      ```
      Not useful? Pah, they make her famous! They give her instant respectability, government support, and social credit. She can go on shows like Oprah and make millions, then donate that money to charitable causes. She specifically notes that, and *whines* about, the fact that she can get away with murder because the government doesn't want to make her an enemy. And she completely fails to use any of this for good, instead choosing to spend all her time moping about how much she sucks.

      On the second point, yes, sure - the author doesn't explicitly paint it as good. But implicitly it's clearly giving voice to a disturbing fantasy. Imagine if it had been a white character hunting and killing black characters instead - methinks this would have been presented in a less sympathetic light.
      ```

      - u/CorneliusPhi:
        ```
        I suppose.  In the end she's just twenty.  Practically still a child.  Not shocking she would make suboptimal choices, especially since she's self-socialized to think of her powers in a negative light.

        I think the better equivalence there would be a black superpower going around killing people in the kkk.  Murder is wrong yes, but people getting away with being bad because of systematic inequality also sucks.  It poses an interesting question.
        ```

        - u/None:
          ```
          At least from how it's described in the comments above, it'd be more like a black superhero running around torturing and murdering people suspected of being in the KKK. I feel like I'd be a lot less conflicted about his if the comment said 'rapist' instead of 'accused of rape'. Is it more clear in the original work if these people are almost definitely guilty?

            It is made apparent that the character goes to great lengths to confirm to her satisfaction that they are guilty. This is emphasized as being very important to her. It's also acknowledged that her judgement is not infallible and that she is practically guaranteed to kill an innocent person eventually if she keeps it up.
            ```

      - u/baroqueSpiral:

        yeah, because it would have been different.  (for instance, one of these things actually happens.)

        >giving voice to a fantasy

        that's a funny thing to complain about in an ingroup as kinky as the rationalist community

    As a counter to your points, I would like to remind you of what happened to Feral.  She may not munchkin her own powers, but she's well aware of the power of munchkinery.  It's even better since she's well aware of the moral issues with how she did it - and I'm pretty sure that she's going to be seeing fallout further down the road.

  DAMMIT, WHY DO YOU NEED TO OBSESSIVELY PUT LABELS ON EVERYTHING?

  Seriously, this isn't against anyone in particular, but we have two of those "Is XXX rational fic?" questions every week. Why do people care so much about a label?

  I mean, I like SFP and I'm all for discussing it, but "Does it match a vaguely-defined concept that people interpret very differently?" really isn't the best open minded discussion subject.

  Grmbl grmbl stop talking about concepts I don't like grmbl grmbl.

    It's pretty concrete on the sidebar. And I dunno about everyone else in /r/rational fiction but *I'm* interested in rational fiction and think it's nice to discover a new story that turns out to be rational once someone posts it. According to the top comment this isn't one but another time it might turn out to be rational and therefore (to me) worth more of a try than others.
    ```

- u/CeruleanTresses:
  ```
  Yeah, I'd say so. Given that the central question driving the protagonist's actions is "How can my superpowers be applied for maximum utility?", it's definitely the kind of thing that appeals to this sub. There's also a lot of philosophical tension between deontological and utilitarian perspectives. Keeping it vague to avoid spoilers, but I think people here would particularly enjoy everything having to do with the character Feral. 

  One thing that distinguishes it from a lot of power munchkinry content is that the main character isn't especially idealized; she is *trying* to do the best she can for the world, but she is very much human, and her powers don't include either superhuman intelligence or superhuman emotional regulation. So there's a lot of struggle between her lofty ideals and her flawed, human impulses, and and a lot of introspection in the vein of "I need to stay cognizant of this personality flaw I know I have" or "Okay, I see now that this is how I fucked up." I don't *dislike* brilliant, hyper-rational protagonists, but I've really enjoyed this character's more relatable struggle to do good.

  Note that the story spends a lot of time exploring social justice concepts, as part of the broader theme of "how can we actually make the world a better place for everyone?". For me that's very appealing, but I know some people find that kind of thing offputting, so fair warning.

  So, I just binge-read this comic over the weekend since seeing the post. 

  I think you could call it rational fic, yes, though the titular protagonist is not herself rational. In fact, she is surrounded by people who approach problems rationally, and she might be the only main character who *doesn't.*

  My main criticism of her is that she doesn't leverage her comparative advantage.  Rational problem solving is about identifying strengths and exploiting them to achieve your aim. 

  Her strengths are obvious, yet she pointedly avoids using them to directly solve problems.  The only thing she does that benefits from her abilities is firefighting.  Honestly, she should just be doing more of this.  Rather than trying to think about the whole world's problems and solve them all at once somehow, she should focus on problems she can solve that others can't. 

  Disaster relief is something she is trained for and has abilities that would make a huge difference.  Simply cooperating with firefighters and the national guard to help with catastrophes could save thousands of lives without the need for violence that she seems worried about.  And that's just thinking locally.  If she actually got her head out of just helping the western world, she could work with relief groups in at-risk areas and make a HUGE difference.  Just transportation of food and medical supplies to hard to reach areas could make a world of difference. 

  These are obvious things she could do that would be personally rewarding and help others, without all the philosophical hand-wringing over how to fix the whole world with "one punch."  

  She's really a poster child for hipster college students who want to THINK about saving the world but not actually DO anything directly useful.

  Definitely rational fic, and potentially even rationalist, if her teatcher's lecture counts.

  Unrelated, but I really want to see an postcanon worm/SFP crossover of some sort.
  ```

- u/vallar57:
  ```
  I think so, yeah. Granted, it's not a munchkinry fic, lots of things could have been done better, but I think it's very realistic, because you don't just go straight from superhero into a perfect social munchkin. She *tries* solving problems through intelligent application of their knowledge and resources, and that's what counts, even when she makes mistakes or outright fails.
