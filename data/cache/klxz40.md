Spoiler warning

I want to ask if the guard that raped Fenn goes unpunished.

I hope not, it would make me drop the novel, I hate when an author drops something like that and leaves it without a conclusion.

  WtC is, in large part, about trying to make power worth something when you _can't_ neatly counter the past traumas.

  Singling out Fenn's rapist for revenge when she herself has other priorities? Her emotional wounds won't be neatly solved by a simple violent payback. Why should we be allowed to pretend otherwise? The story does address a different rape later on, in substantially more depth. But that later, more detailed rape-response is not "and now we've punished someone, so things are fixed."

  Lots of stories have awful things happen, and then act like they can be neatly set right. But WtC isn't about un-breaking what's broken and un-scarring what's been scarred. WtC is all about the _other_ kind of getting past trauma.

  That no-erasure attitude makes WtC more glum than I like at times... but also makes it meaningful and authentic.

  Yeah, it could be frustrating that in this gamelike world, Fenn's unhappy past isn't reduced to a tidy kill-the-baddie quest. But that's key to WtC. In a genre full of "power = easy escapism," WtC lets me read the other side of it: "I have huge power, and I _still_ have real problems that power won't erase."

  That's not much of a spoiler warning, you can still see the next line from the subreddit.  But in answer to your question, thus far the guy has never so much as had his name revealed, and for spoilery reasons I suspect he never will.  However, as we've already established that the DM who's apparently responsible for everything terrible on Aerb will keep Joon from punishing him, the anonymous guard seems like small potatoes.

  Why do you consider not addressing punishment for this guard to be something that needs addressing in the story?

    WtC is a story about story tropes. So I can kind of see how OP would think "hey, the story mentions a rapist, that's a Villain Signal, why aren't they doing something about it?"

    But in real life, most rape victims don't want to be defined by the rape, and most rapists are the alarmingly typical product of screwed-up societies rather than distinctively evil cackling villains. And for Fenn's rape WtC mostly follows life, rather than tropes.

    It didn't confuse me, unlike OP. But I could imagine a paragraph where Joon thought about a hypothetical revenge mission, both in terms of whether the DM means it as a quest hook and how Fenn would feel about it. Not because WtC sets us up to fetishize Fenn's rape as defining her - it doesn't, it's obviously way more concerned with her unhappy childhood among "proper" elves - but because there are other stories that would go that direction.

    So why didn't AWales write in that paragraph? Maybe because "avenge a rape" is more of a trope in _films_ than in _games_. Personal revenge on random lowlifes who hurt your people? That's not a tabletop RPG thing. When you run a fantasy game, the party's Designated Villains are going to be people with interesting setting content - like the pureblood elves.

  If you want rape to be handled in a delicate and thoughtful way in the story, exploring its implications and how deep and lasting its damage can be. Keep reading.

  If you want that random guard to die. Don't hold your breath. By the time Joon gets around to avenging past wrongs rather than dealing with imminent cataclysmic events... he'll probably be a god already and the story will be in epilogue.
