## Looking for Contributors for a Rational Fiction

### Post:

A while back I had an idea that I would start writing a rational fiction, with a twist. My plan is to create a general setting and world, and a few individual characters, and find some people who are confident they can get in the mindset of said characters to RP them as the story goes on. If you'd be interested in being involved please leave a comment or PM me.

Edit: Hey interested parties. Just so you know I am now pretty much full up on characters, the only one I have left is age 56 so I'd be looking for someone who is at least in their late thirties to RP him. I will need help with the editing and writing process, and for those of you who were interested in participating but didn't make it in time to get a character I promise to hit each of you up when the time for the first chapter to be published comes around.

  ```
  Otherwise generic rationalist with special affinity for mystics or priests of either gender (or none), registering tentative interest. I've always thought this would be a good way to write rat fics.

- u/Nepene:
  ```
  I am a long term roleplayer, with experience DMing and playing as a player, plus I've written a few rational bits of story. I'd be happy doing this.

  Interesting, I don't have the time between my own projects to spare on this, but good luck.

  Have you looked at this thread already?: https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2x6pxd/bst_something_quest/

  And the subreddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/MSDATB/

  Sorry if those are not what you are looking for. You seem to be thinking of individuals playing individual characters instead of groups playing characters.

  ```
  i'm interested, if there aren't too many people (as it looks like there probably are)
  ```

  ```
  I'm interested, but ultimately it comes down to the setting we're doing this in.
  ```

- u/Sailor_Vulcan:
  ```
  this looks really fun. what would the schedule be like, and what characters are still available to RP?
  ```

- u/avret:
  ```
  Rationalist with predilection for creative(if brutal) munchkinry of limited resources if possible--I'm interested in RPing any character though.
  ```

- u/CaesarQ:
  ```
  Another rationalist, strong background in theoretical physics and mathematics.  Could offer facility for realistic descriptions of inventions, rules for device operation, and general improvisations.  I am still new to role-playing (only been playing for about a year now), but I have a strong imagination and enjoy writing.

  Would like more information before I fully commit, but you've certainly piqued my interest.
