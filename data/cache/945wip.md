## Looking for recommendations

### Post:

Read HPMOR, Shadows of the Limelight, Ra, and The Arithmancer. Also everything by Wildbow who doesn't brag about rational writing but apparently is still associated with it? Well the first two seemed infested with a protagonist who was smug, self-serving, and secretive of their goals. Even though she kept most of the knowledge to herself, Arithmancer/Archimedes at least was refreshing for the fact that she involved others in her planning, taught others, and raised other characters up for their own benefit rather than hers.

Does anyone have recommendations where protagonists are less smug, are part of a team of rationalists, or make more collaborative plans?

Thanks

  As another poster mentioned, you might want to scan through some of the [monthly recommendation threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/monthlyrecommendation). Posters usually post a brief (or sometimes not so brief) description of what they liked or didn't like and why.

  Rational*ist* fiction is far less common than *rational* or rational-adjacent fiction that often gets posted here. Besides Pokemon: The Origin of Species, I can't think of too many rationalist fics with teams of rationalists. There are plenty of rational or adjacent fictions with teams that work together or collaborate, though. Hero's War, Practical Guide to Evil, Worth the Candle, and to a lesser extent The Gods are Bastards (they have teams, but aren't always rational) and Mother of Learning (protagonist is rational, but usually solitary or working primarily with one other character).

  Are you following Pokemon: The Origin of Species? Updates first of each month. Red, Blue, and ~~Green~~ Leaf are definitely team players.

  I also consider TOoS to be rationalist, not just rational. Lots of emphasis on how to think and plan better, including things you *can* try at home.

  There's *Animorphs: the reckoning* which features a team of kids trying to be rational. Seems to fit what you're looking for. (Although, it hasn't updated in a while, not sure what's going on with it)

  I really liked Archimedes for that reason too, that and the relentless work ethic (of which I'm rather envious).


  I have a question about Origin of Species:
  I have no familiarity at all with Pokemon, and not a lot of interest in the concept (which seems to be a few degrees of separation from dog fighting).
  However people have said it's quite educational, and I'm wondering if it's worth reading because of that?

  check out a heros war magical portal fantasy where the protagonist leads a magical industrial revolution via calculus and founds his own public university, educates the masses and generally tries to improve quality of life for the people

  The Waves Arisen is pretty team-oriented. Ever seen Naruto and Sasuke use marriage counseling techniques to work through their personality clashes? Lots of laughs.

  [Blindsight by Peter Watts](http://www.rifters.com/real/Blindsight.htm). Rational classic about a group of scientists tasked to make first contact with alien life.

    I'm not sure what's up with that link, but I'm interested if you can find the story. That definitely sounds unique!
