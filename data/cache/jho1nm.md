  Finally getting some action. If frustratingly dragged out.

  How long has it been since we actually saw Rain in a prepared party fighting against something that's actually a danger to him? Not since the original journey to the first lair right?

    I’ve been letting chapters save up because this story moves so slow as a webserial.

    I’ve got a month’s worth of chapters saved up.  Should I wait another month or just wait a year?  Anyone on Patreon want to chime in?
    ```

    - u/Watchful1:
      ```
      You should probably wait like six months. You did pick a good stopping place though. But I'm confident this arc is going to get drawn out as much as the last one.

        Is it worth starting the series now with that in mind? How good are the early chapters/arcs?
        ```

          ```
          The first arc is great. That's why it's so popular. The second drags on if you're reading it one chapter a week, but I imagine it would flow a lot better if you read it all at once.

          The only thing really frustrating about it is the slow pace of new chapters.

      Just honestly forget about it for awhile. If you’re checking these posts you’ll find out when it’s worth jumping back in. There will be 100+ comments on the chapter he raises his cap, or the chapter 8 before that one when people in here are all buying the patron to read it. 


      If you look there was a good run of early-mid chapters that all got 75+ comments, now we’re sitting around like 25-40. Just watch these threads for the next few months.

      Depends what you were looking for to restart reading.
      The story will still be here a few years from now though
      ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    I mean that nasty bug thing almost killed Val and also wrecked Rain's armor like a tin can.
    ```

- u/Bezant:
  ```
  Seemed like the author making an effort to gimp Rain because we saw how bad detection trivializes dungeons before.
  ```

  - u/EsquilaxM:
    ```
    Or perhaps it's answering the question of why doesn't every delving party have detection?

    Besides, we already knew it was unreliable since the previous lair, even more so in lairs.
    ```

  ```
  At least we get some weirdness in the lair. I liked this chapter more than most of the recent ones!

  I'm a little bit miffed that Rain just completely writes off Ava. Like. She's Awakened. She's a better (and more experienced) mage than Kettle is at twice her age. She's a better shot than anybody in the company other than Amelia and Jamus. She's a *fire mage* in an *ice dungeon*. And didn't she directly save Rain's bacon at least once during the Rank Shift? I distinctly remember her having a Big Damn Heroes moment. And Mlem is even also going. 

  But because she's a young person, he writes her off a even a possibility to go.

  I know nobody is going to agree with me and I'll probably get downvoted to hell, but it makes me sad to see competent young people overlooked just for being young.

    If you can avoid bringing a preteen (isn't she like 8??) into a combat situation, don't bring them. That's nearly always going to be true. You're saying "just for being young", but it's very much a relevant factor.

    Less experienced, less reliable under pressure, and good odds of lifelong trauma from being a combatant at a young age. Rain is from our world, and I'm guessing his opinion of child soldiers is not high. It would super OoC to take her if nothing else.
    ```

  - u/Veedrac:
    ```
    I don't think he doubts her ability, I think he doesn't want to send a young girl onto an unseen active battlefield.
    ```

- u/LazarusRises:
  ```
  Aw yeah, time to see what a balanced party with defined roles can do. This reminds me of the feeling I used to get before a big cape fight in Worm.

  Also, I'm really glad to see that Delve hit #1 by followers! All the whining about pacing/leveling in this sub gave me the false impression that the wider community didn't enjoy the story. Happy to see I'm in the majority that don't have that problem.
