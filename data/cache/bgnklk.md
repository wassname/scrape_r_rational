## [C] [DC] "To Board the Ark": Noah's Ark story from the perspective of those left behind.

### Post:

When the great flood came, Tel's family and the rest of the villagers fled upland. Now they must brave the massive waves to make it aboard Noah's ark. But though the villagers curse them for it, Noah and his god have no intention of letting anyone else on board.

  Well holy shit, thatâ€™s disturbing.

  Good writing, but disturbing.

  I like it.  I've always imagined something similar, but with Noah being a self righteous prick, I like your version better.

  I like.  It is a very interesting and rather disturbing story, but, I have to ask...  where you *trying* to do a little give and take for both sides of what was going on, or were you focused on only expressing one point of view?

  'Cause man, I gotta tell you, most of the people in this story are **DENSE**.  When Tel asks Noah what is god is the god *of*, I half expect him to answer with "Natural Selection".

    Why do you say they're dense? Monotheism wasn't all that common in the past - in fact, early Jews were probably *henotheists*, meaning they believed there were other gods, and JHVH was merely their own, in outright competition with the others to make his people triumph. So it's pretty natural for a person of that time to imagine a god to be god of... something, like storms, sea, or whatever, given this display of power over weather and water.

    yea I didn't want Noah to be a storybook villain, hence I presented him as a person who wanted to do good but couldn't.
    ```
