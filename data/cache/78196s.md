## Rational Ben 10 Fan-Fiction

### Post:

Ben 10 was a large part of my childhood growing up and he holds a special place in my heart. But I’d be lying if I said that everything was entirely rational and made logical sense. 

So I’ve decided to undergo writing a rational Ben 10 Fan Fiction that will make sense especially in context to the aliens in Ben’s omnitrix. 

There will be new additions to Ben’s omnitrix and I’ll be changing a lot of the events in Ben 10 Alien Force and Ultimate Alien.

  Don't make a thread just to announce your intent. Have at least one chapter to post while doing so.

    I’m in the process of writing the first chapter but I’m still putting the finishing touches on to it.

      And when you put the finishing touches on it, then you can make a thread.

  One thing that always concerned me in Ben 10 was that the omnitrix was supposed to contain the DNA of all the species in the galaxy to foster unity or something, but the aliens Ben gets access to are ones that are useful in combat, instead of weak species like humans.  Why did he get those combat species (and Greymatter) out of all the species he could have gotten?  Why did humans fall on the shallow end of the power pool?

    If I'm not mistaken, it wasn't to foster unity, it was to serve as kind of Noah's Ark, preserving the genetic code of all species. Ben got access to useful forms that would increase his chances of survival, as keeper of the Omnitrix.

  I vaguely remember liking that show before CN ran it into the ground. Good luck to you.

  Heh, I've been thinking of writing one too. I'm glad to see there's more overlap between Ben 10 and Rational Fiction lovers. Maybe I'll finally get around do doing it sometime.
