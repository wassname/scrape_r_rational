  >“The blue sail?”

  >“…is a good Roman Catholic,” said John, smiling. “It only responds to the prayers of a priest.”

  >“What? Why?”

  >“It is,” he said with some chagrin, “a Mass-energy converter.”

  This story in a nutshell.

    > This story in a nutshell.

    Needs a dash of black comedy that is then revealed to be not funny at all and totally horrible.

      Have you seen what happens when something gets crammed into a nutshell?

      It dies, scruiser.

      It dies.

    I think this is the best pun so far, it just has this beautiful simplicity.

  ```
  So Ana was studying theodicy, started at Ithaca and is now on a journey back to her comfort zone, summoning winds given to her by a mystical figure, with the boat's captain being nobody?
  ```

- u/Escapement:
  ```
  Simeon is now the least trustworthy character in Unsong. Less trustworthy than Thaumiel or Satan. Interestingly, the biblical origin of his name sometimes is "he who listens [to the words of God]" and sometimes "there is sin". So it would be a great name for a traitor, but also for a theodician.

  (I was just going through Pratchett's Maskerade recently, and the practice of telling a person's character by testing the firmness of their handshake and looking deeply into their eyes is remarked upon repeatedly in that book; want to guess how trustworthy the guy described as "giving [...] a firm handshake and looking [...] squarely in the eye" is?)

  Also, the Mass-energy converter pun is *bad* and Scott should be ashamed of himself. I laughed, a lot.

  Finally, colours of sail:

  Red - Normal wind  
  Orange - Placebo  
  Yellow - Kabbalah  
  Green - Singing?  
  Blue - Prayer  
  Violet - Angel   
  Black - The Comet King (?)  

  I myself can't really reliably tell Indigo from Blue/Violet interface, so I'm totally fine with not having an Indigo sail.

  The Comet King sail seems like the sort of plot hook where it will ultimately be driven by Cometspawn, maybe.
  ```

  - u/DCarrier:
    ```
    Or by Aaron when he becomes the new Comet King.
    ```

  - u/ZeroNihilist:
    ```
    I suspect that the black sail is driven by an action, much like the others. Even the violet sail is powered by the angel conducting the heavenly power, not just being an angel.

    What we know is that the Comet King drew his sword. It doesn't mention anything else, but I suspect it's something specific. For example, the true and honest intent to defeat Thamiel and save the victims in hell.

      Might need nephilim power.

  - u/TK17Studios:
    ```
    I read recently that, when Newton first popularized thinking of the spectrum as having seven specific bands, "blue" was the label for what we'd now call cyan, and "indigo" was the label for a deep, rich, dark blue.  So ... maybe you *can* tell indigo apart?
    ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    What if Simeon *is* Thaumiel, trying to reach and kill Metatron? What if he can power the black sail?
    ```

        ```
        Or even Edgar Crane is the villain on the ship, and this is a case where the story isn't following story logic.
        ```

- u/None:
  ```
  Im pleased to see we are now inching towards the (a?) plot
  ```
