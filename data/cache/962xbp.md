## [RT] [HF] [DC] [FF] How do I make a rational rewrite of Touhou?

### Post:

For those new to the series, the short summary is that Touhou is a series of shooters, but with girls & fairies instead of ships & aliens.  It takes place in a sanctuary for magical creatures (called "youkai" in-setting) known as Gensokyo.  They resolve serious disputes with magic laser paintball, except when they don’t.  There's a loose metaplot, and hints of something serious, but everything tends to end in a lighthearted non-event.

The [long summary](https://rabbiteclair.tumblr.com/post/173504016367/i-know-nothing-about-touhou-but-i-think-its) has been told better by RabbitClair, but these excerpts should get the crux of my issue across:

>Almost as importantly, pretty much *every single character* is some form of petty, irresponsible doofus. 

>There are about a hundred characters with superhuman abilities, and 90% of them are far more interested in enjoying themselves than having a serious throwdown. 

>There are hints at a darker side, but you have to look for it. 

>The series gets to drop the occasional hint that some dark stuff is going on, but it’s mostly up to the fans to piece that together and decide what it looks like, or if they care to engage with it at all.

It’s been my observation that the fans *don’t.*  Put glibly, at the risk of being offensive, I’m into dark, depths, and drama, while the fandom’s generally into memes, moe, and merch.  However, I’ve been assured there are others who are at least appreciative of my preferences, and I may be inaccurate with my generalization, so I figure this idea is worth a try.  

I already have some ideas to start with, but I want to know your thoughts on the feasibility of the premise, in addition to suggestions I can add to my own ideas.  I also want to know what questions you have that aren’t answered by the [comprehensive wiki](https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Touhou_Wiki).

  Given that the Touhou universe is full of inhuman beings, it's not necessarily surprising that those beings tend to behave in ways that don't match human rationality. If I wanted to write in the Touhou universe, I'd start with that premise. Touhou isn't a setting full of magical humans making bad decisions (there are only a few of those); it's mostly a setting full of immortal alien hedonists who don't often experience much in the way of consequences for their actions.

  For a rational take on the setting, you probably want an outsider's perspective; a protagonist who lacks many of the advantages and protections the natives take for granted, and doesn't have enough ties to the locals to be willing to graciously overlook all the destruction caused by the latest cataclysmic temper tantrum some centuries-old brat just threw. As a rational work, you're mostly looking at the thorny game-theoretic problem of attempting to negotiate with aliens who have a different value system.

    Good point about about immortal alien hedonists, which bears keeping in mind regarding youkai psychology.  Especially since how youkai treat humans is a big part of the political metaplot that could do with some development.

    As for an outsider’s perspective, I’d have a lot to choose from since a significant number of the named characters have only arrived within the last decade or two.  Thankfully, two particular recent arrivals have significant ambitions for the realm.

      > youkai psychology

      One thing you can do: bear down on this idea. That is, look at how youkai think in shinto mythology, and in other fictional settings that treat them more seriously (e.g. Mushi-Shi, Natsume Yuujinchou.) Then use that to inform how *these* youkai "must be" thinking, treating whatever surface-level actions they're performing as a pretence.

      Mind you, youkai acting under pretences isn't really "a thing" in Shinto mythology; but it would still play well with a Western readership, because "keeping up a pretence while playing the long game" is 100% how the equivalent creatures act in western Fairy tales.
      ```

      - u/AlgaeNymph:
        ```
        I took the liberty of asking the Touhou channel in a Shinto Discord server and...there was a heated (though relatively civil) argument as to whether youkai are monsters or people.  If nothing else that's already a canon plot point I feel is in need of development.

        Also, one of them wanted clarification as to what you meant by "acting under pretense."

  Yukari and the other sages of Gensokyo are actually fairly rational given their goals and the rules of the universe they operate under.  Yukari and the other sages predicted that the advance of science would metaphysically threaten their existence.  They can’t destroy humanity because the need human belief/faith/fear.  So they engineered a pocket reality where the human population can be carefully controlled and regulated.  They and other youkai have extremely destructive  reality warping powers, so they work out a system of formalized system of duels that let battle in a controlled but enjoyable fashion.  Feral youkaj and youkai that refuse the system get eliminated by Reimu.  Reimu also eliminates human villagers that become Youkai (ie Forbidden Scrollery), thus keeping the supply of fear/faith/belief from becoming unusable.  

  In Silent Sinner In Blue and it related stories, Yukari perfectly demonstrates Quirrelmort’s idea of losing to achieves a broader goal in her interactions with the Lunarians.  Likewise in Wild and Horned Hermit, Yukari lets Reimu beat her and takes the blame for an incident caused by Sumireko while secretly fixing the problem.

  If you want rationalist Touhou, just retell it from Yukari’s perspective as she plots and schemes continuously to keep Gensokyo running smoothly.

  If you want a darker story, maybe Kosuzu discovering the truth of Gensokyo (ie the villagers are a carefully controlled resource that live in fear, outsiders are drawn in for Youkai that need meat, etc.)?  Yukari already works as a rationalist antagonist given that she has the logical goal of sustaining herself and other Youkai at the expense of a villages fear and the occasionally eaten outsider.

  - u/AlgaeNymph:
    ```
    A lot of good points regarding Yukari, and good on you to note those.  And yes, I certainly agree that Yukari’s definitely a rationalist in the context of her goals.  I see you as an invaluable resource in the near future.  

    I *do* plan on telling the story through her perspective, just…not *entirely* through her perspective.  There are other women with other agendas, notably Kanako and Byakuren, who have their own differing progressive designs for Gensokyo.  And then there’re the Lunarians, who I’d also like to have proactive.  And things get even more complicated when bringing Makai into the mix…

  You may be interested in [*Imperfect Metamorphosis*](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5829008/1/Imperfect-Metamorphosis), a *Touhou* fanfiction to end all *Touhou* fanfiction^(1).  I've read about 16/70 of it, likely based on Yudkowsky's recommendation, and if I recall correctly, it was reasonably rational and appropriately dark.

  But to answer your question, here's my own idea:

  There is some kind of supremely powerful overseer-entity, which ensures that Gensokyo is peaceful. If it discovers that someone isn't being peaceful, it retaliates with overwhelming force: either just terminates the offender, or brainwashes them, or throws them Outside to be comprehended by crazy human scientists/philosophers until they're reduced to basic concepts (whichever you prefer). I think there's an obvious character to fit this role, namely the border-controller.^(2)

  Consequently, everyone has to pretend that all their disputes and conflicts are silly squabbles.

  Problem is, they're *not*. Many of these non-human entities are unrepentant murderers and monsters, fundamentally evil or amoral creatures who enjoy carnage. Others are, oppositely, good and nice. Still others don't care about good/evil at all, or have blue & orange morality. The sanctuary houses numerous entities of different ideologies, and some of them grew rather used over centuries to impose their values upon the world by force.

  But if they try that now, the overseer-entity would notice, and would promptly curb-stomp them.

  As such, they're forced to keep up the facade of outwards niceness, while covertly weaving sinister plots, scheming and manipulating. Every once in a while it gets a bit too intense, weapons get put to use, but naturally everyone involved abruptly de-escalates right near the end and plays it off as a joke.

  Since many of these entities are supremely powerful (but not *quite* on the overseer's level), that equilibrium is unstable. Enter the protagonist:

  * An enforcer of the overseer-entity (drama).

  * A megalomaniacal brilliant manipulator who starts off as a minor fairy (political thriller).

  * A bloodthirty vampire who is now forced to play politics during adorable tea parties (dark comedy).

  * Someone else, I dunno.

  Clarify if you want ideas about something more particular.

  ^(1. Or not. I mean, that's basically the only thing I consumed of *Touhou* aside from some brief skimming of its TV Tropes page, but it's a million words long and apparently employs **all the characters**, so that seems like a reasonable guess.)

  ^(2. Which is OP as hell, by the way; I'm suggesting to make her basically God of the setting and you would *still* need to nerf her for there to be a story. Seriously, what stops her from blurring the border between "potential world I wish to occupy" and "actual world" for instant global victory? Non-munchkins...)

  Anyways, I care approximately 0% about touhou, for various reasons, but I'm interested in helping you with your quest. So first of all, you've gotta figure out what you want to *do.* This isn't what draws you to touhou, but rather what is drawing you to make a specifically rational work within the setting. You seem to be aware of it, but seem confused by all the other stuff tohou has going on.

  Second of all, you need to start dissecting the setting. For example, the people the series focuses on are big names insulated from the consequences of their actions, which is a story as old as time. Focusing on a little person or someone who doesn't have as big a name and is forced to pick up the pieces after the big names roll through is one way to up the dark level. Not everyone in the setting is an immortal prepubescent girl.

  Put another way, the one's capable of having a serious throw down aren't interested in doing so because they're going to be nice and comfortable anyways, while the ones that actually have a bone to pick and stakes are cannon fodder. Mayhaps a time for revolution?

    I gave your fic a look.  I think it's lack of acclaim is due to it being one of many "guy in Gensokyo"-type fics.  Did show off the characters all right, though.

    I don’t plan on having a lot of killing, though I’m undecided on the danmaku battles.  It’s likely I’ll include it since it’s an important social element, but I’m not likely to write out a lot of spell card battles.

    As for food, I believe that youkai technically only need to feed on belief; it’s just that fear is their preferred flavor.  Same with anthropophagy: they *like* the taste of humans, but don’t necessarily *have* to eat them.  Thing is, since youkai are beings of belief, and humans *believe* youkai eat humans, a fear that’s fostered by the youkai themselves…  Yeah, we have a self-perpetuating social problem, and a serious challenge for would-be reformers like Byakuren.

  This seems like a setting which would be far better suited for explorations of fun theory, instead of the grim dark meathooks of the grim dark fantasy world. 

  So.. *do not* make it darker, just make at least some of the characters be really interested in what fun actually is, and how their powers can make the world a better place while amusing them as well.
  ```

  - u/AlgaeNymph:

    Whoa, I don’t plan on making it *grim* dark; more like nobledark, made all the more tricky by Touhou being grimbright by default.  [“What?"](https://www.deviantart.com/mikeytheblackmantis/art/Of-Grimdarks-and-Noblebrights-321271581), you ask?  Grimbright’s when a dangerous setting is played light-heartedly, while nobledark’s where people are basically good even when he situation very much isn’t.  I do note that my clarification doesn’t essentially contradict your noting that I’m swimming against the current here.  Still, I find it difficult to focus on fun theory when a significant number of the population are relegated to being peddlers, minstrels, and shylocks.

    Though I am curious by that new term.  What *is* fun theory?
    ```

    - u/scruiser:
      ```
      [Fun Theory](http://yudkowsky.net/singularity/fun-theory/) is a term coined by Yudkowsky in one of his sequences to describe hedonics in the context of maximizing "fun" over an immortal post-scarcity lifespan.  He basically reinvented the term for [hedonic calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felicific_calculus)... in some cases Yudkowsky misses the conventional term because of his autodidact background, but in this case, I believe he intentionally chose a new term because "fun" is more general and has less wire-heading connotations in comparison to the term "hedonic calculus".
      ```

  You should really check out the other source material such as the mangas and art books. They give the bulk of the background information and characterizations of the characters. Another important thing to remember is that the characters in the games are not an accurate representation of all members of their species. All the characters are or are closely involved with a character who can cause world changing events, so they act differently than what most of their races would. I stopped following for a while, but I used to be really into it so if you want to ask about some of the "dark" background you can ask.
  ```

    I have, in fact.  I've read the whole run of Forbidden Scrollery, as well as a large part of Wild and Horned Hermit and Sangetsusei.  They're good for bits of lore and (judging by the stories he tells) insight into how ZUN thinks, but I've stopped following them as well as they didn't make for satisfying reading.  Still ,I should give them a looksee again with a particularly analytical friend to see if ai missed anything.  Also, I'll keep in mind that notable characters aren't necessarily representative of their kind.
