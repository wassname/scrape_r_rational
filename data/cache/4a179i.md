  Could anyone give me a summary? Maybe sell the story a little? I'm really not sure what kind of story I should expect from this.

    ```
    The remnant refugee fleet transformed itself into a mobile civilization that's on the run for a quarter century until they found our Earth.

    Unlike canon, they were given tools that the fleeing Colonials never had in the show, like a full mobile shipyard.

  Is this posted on any fanfiction sites by any chance? trying to read off a forum on mobile is a pain in the ass
  ```

    Yes, check the first post.
