## [RT][Repost] Everything by Ted Chiang

### Post:

It's been 8 months since the last thread with his name in it, so I figure it might be long enough to justify a repost. (none of the quoted text below is mine):

>Ted Chiang is an author noteworthy for his excellent rational science fiction. I consider his work to be some of the most relevant to this subreddit. He pretty much exclusively writes short stories, and they're all amazing. Many of you will have read his writing, but I feel like since it has been some months since the last "Everything by Ted Chiang" post, it's time for a new post to show our new readers some of the very best this genre has to offer.

>The first story of his I read was [Exhalation](http://www.nightshadebooks.com/Downloads/Exhalation%20-%20Ted%20Chiang.html), the story of a scientist who isn't afraid to face the truth. I cried at the end, because the beauty of the story was too much for me. Read it first, and you will end up reading the rest of his work.

>Many of his short stories are in a collection for sale on [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Stories-Your-Life-Others-Chiang/dp/1931520720/), or you can read them [online](http://archive.is/v9xMy). One short story, [The Truth of Fact, The Truth of Feeling](http://subterraneanpress.com/magazine/fall_2013/the_truth_of_fact_the_truth_of_feeling_by_ted_chiang) is not in that collection, but is available online and generally considered an excellent rationalist work.

>I highly recommend all of Ted Chiang's stories. I bought the book and have no regrets.

>/u/Prezombie recommends [two](http://www.sffaudio.com/?p=30099) [sites](https://archive.org/search.php?query=ted%20chiang) with podcasted audiobook versions of Ted Chiang's works.

  Hell is the Absence of God is my personal favourite: the author's notes at the end of the volume basically say "I thought the book of Job missed the point so I wrote a better version", and he wasn't kidding.
  ```

    I just read this and what the fuck. The story resonates with me but still what the fuck. I think I need to read the book of Job now to fully understand it.

    Reading that one fucked me up. I was not OK for several days.

    Also, any Ted Chiang thread should point out that last year's film *Arrival* was an adapting of his short story "Story of Your Life."

    Basically everything he does is quality, but my personal top 5 would be:

    * The Merchant and the Alchemist's Gate

    * Exhalation

    * The Truth of Fact, The Truth of Feeling

    * Seventy-Two Letters

    * Hell is the Absence of God
    ```

  Absolutely amazing author! Pretty much all his works are short stories that are *very* well written.
  My favorites:

  * Story of Your Life. (Goes without saying, that story was incredible)
  * Tower of Babylon
  * The Merchant and the Alchemist's Gate
  * The Truth of Fact, the Truth of Feeling

  If you haven't heard of him before, definitely give his works a shot. His many Hugo, Nebula, and Locust awards are very well-deserved.

  the online link is broken and the link for "the truth of fact, the truth of feeling" just goes to the subterranean press page. Searching this page doesn't turn up anything relating to "the truth of fact, the truth of feeling"

  however i think you can use archive.org to get the same functionality: http://archive.is/v9xMy

    My experience is you can use this to get every one of his stories. Google it, find the defunct page, then use wayback machine or something to get them.

    "Liking What You See" is my favorite, but "Hell" is a close second.

    Thanks, added your link. If I have some time I'll look around for other mirrors.

      (it's just https instead of http now)

- u/MultipartiteMind:
  ```
  (Out of curiosity, does anyone else feel the concept 'futility' as a running trend through his stories?)
  ```

  - u/fervoredweb:
    ```
    It seems less like 'futility' and more like 'acceptance'. Acceptance of entropy. Of inevitability. Of things that will be, or once were. But it doesn't seem like a vein of hopeless acceptance. Rather, it seems to be more along the lines of 'these are things as they are, don't let them bog you down.'
    ```

- u/bugwug:
  ```
  I looked for "Stories of Your Life and Others" at my library and found out that it has been republished under the name "Arrival" since the release of the movie. The table of contents is identical. Overdrive has both editions in epub format.
