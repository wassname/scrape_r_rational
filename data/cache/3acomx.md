**A Man and His Dog**

**Part 1 of 3**

...

**Woof**

"What is it, Penny?" I asked, looking up at the screen where Penny's golden retriever avatar was barking at me.

A window in a window opened up, showing a group of six figures in identical white lab coats and suitcases approaching the building.  Based on how closely they were walking together, they were visiting as a group.

*Another group coming here to test Penny, hoping to debunk our research.*

A quick glance at the clock at the bottom right of my monitor confirmed that It was as late as I thought.

*It's after seven PM.  Well outside visiting hours.  Did someone schedule something at odd hours and not tell me?*

"Who's still in the building, Penny?"

Penny whined and looked out of her monitor at me, clearly confused.

*A teachable moment then.  I'm surprised I hadn't thought of this before.  It's a very good, very useful thing for Penny to know.*

The desk camera was active and positioned so Penny could see my screen and keyboard.  I opened the security package and typed in the command to show a list of people inside the building.

"Who's still in the building, Penny?" I said again, as I pressed the carriage return, initiating the search.

There was a substantial spike of CPU usage from the facility's small server farm, which was definitely not from my simple inquiry.  On my screen, there was a list of names.  I was the only researcher present.  There were two of the janitorial staff, and Jamal, the security guard.

There was another bark from Penny, and I looked at her screen.  Four camera views popped up, windows inside Penny's window.  One showed me, one showed Jamal, and the other two showed the two janitors.  All four popup windows had a name associated with it that matched the security program's list.

I picked up the phone on my desk and dialed security as I pulled up the schedule for the next day.  It wouldn't be the first time a delegation had gotten their AM and PM mixed up, though I'd never had a group actually show up late.  They were usually professional enough to at least call and verify odd meeting times outside normal business hours.

As the phone rang, I determined that there was, in fact, a meeting for the next morning.  A group of Indian scientists from the TIJ Group.  Looking at the approaching men, it was very possible they were from India.  The fact that they were all fairly thin with dark hair and dark-olive complexioned didn't mean they were from India, but it seemed reasonable.  If they had all been almost seven feet tall and built like Norse deities with giant red beards and pale skin, well, the chances of them being a delegation from India would be quite a bit more difficult to believe, at best.

In the window, I saw Jamal staring out the glass front of the building at the approaching men with a frown on his face.  He looked at the phone on his desk as it started to ring, then back at the group approaching the building.  He picked up the receiver and spoke crisply to me.  "Yes, Doctor Smith, how can I help?"

"Jamal, those people are probably with the TIJ Group.  Please advise them that their scheduled appointment is for eight AM tomorrow, not eight PM today.  I would greatly appreciate it if you would assist them in calling a cab to get back to their hotel if none of them have a phone that works in the US.  They are not to be allowed in.  Doctor Ajibana is who they are scheduled to meet, and he is not present.  I have plans for this evening with my wife and daughter."

"I'll let them know, sir." Jamal firmly responded.  "Anything else?"

"No, Jamal, that will be all.  Thank you."

Jamal was good people.  An ex-marine with a prosthetic leg from the knee down, we had hired him because he was a veteran, handicapped, and came with some very good recommendations from a local politician.  Unlike most other things forced upon us by politicians over the years, I was very happy with Jamal working for us.

Jamal stood and began walking towards the front of the building to speak to the approaching delegation.  He could have simply spoken to them through the intercom, but he didn't.  Despite his leg, he always went to the door when afterhours visitors arrived.  I had asked him why, once, and he said "I can't let the leg make me too lazy, sir."  After that day, I had a lot more respect for a man who I had barely paid attention to before, and made certain he got a nice raise and a solid Christmas bonus every year.

Now that he had instructions from me, Jamal would handle the approaching men calmly and politely, I knew, so I turned back to my screen and started reviewing the last email I planned to write that evening.  I had only finished the first paragraph when I heard what sounded like books falling off a shelf.

I sighed and made a note to have Florence, the head of building maintenance, check the tiles around bookshelves in the waiting areas for damage.

Penny started barking and growling loudly, in a menacing tone.  I turned to her monitor in surprise.  She hadn't shown anger in months, after she had acclimated.

"What's wrong, Penny?" I asked before my eyes took in the single windowed image on Penny's screen.  It wasn't a fallen bookshelf, it was seven men.  Six men in white coats with pistols drawn, walking through shattered glass and towards the fallen body of Jamal.

I watched Jamal try to crawl away, but the first man through the door jogged forward, and pushed his pistol against Jamal's head.  There was another sound like a book falling to the floor.  Jamal's head jerked, hitting the floor, and the tiles around him were splattered with red.

I stared, shocked, at the screen.  Penny was growling and barking.  Staring at me.  Exactly what I had trained her to do in the case of an intruder in the house.  Bark, do not engage.  Wake Jen and I up.

I tore my eyes away from the screen, snatched my phone off the desk, and started dialing.

No signal.  I waved the phone frantically in the air around my office.  Still no signal.

I looked at the screen again, and Penny showed me an image of three men with white coats.  One was kneeling beside a device connected to the wall by an electrical cord.  The other two were using something to tie the two janitor's arms and legs together, and then tie arms to legs.

The janitors, at least, hadn't been killed.

I glanced at my cellphone, which showed 'Searching...' Then the device plugged into the wall.

*They brought a signal jammer.*

"Penny.  Secure shutdown!"  I yelled as I jumped to my feet and ran towards the fire exit closest to me, carrying my phone.

I should have started running immediately, of course.  Hindsight is 20/20.

The building simply wasn't large enough for me, an overweight man in my fifties to escape from the building before three very fit young men caught up with me.  They didn't even need to shoot me.  It was really quite embarrassing how easily they ran me down in the hall way leading to the stairwell.  I'm not going to talk about it.

After being subdued, I was dragged down to the meeting room.  They didn't even carry their pistols.

There was some muttering in a language I didn't know as the three men brought me to the break room.  The two janitors were in two opposite corners of the room, laying on the ground, hogtied, but conscious.  There was an office chair set up in front of a camera, and there were several lengths of rope hanging over the back of the chair.

Four men were in the room.  Two of the others were elsewhere.  A man with a little grey in his hair and a poorly-healed scar on his cheek turned around from where he had been setting up the camera.  "Good Evening, Doctor Neil Smith.  Are you prepared to go to Hell today?"

A camera.  A chair.  Ropes.  Going to Hell.  It suddenly struck me what their plans were for me.  I grabbed one of the young men next to me and slammed him bodily into another with a burst of adrenaline, knocking them both to the ground.  As I turned to face the third, something hard struck me on the side of the temple, and there was a brief moment of tunnel vision before darkness.

**A Man and His Dog**

**Part 2 of 3**

There was a horrible, painful smell, and my head jerked back.  The scarred man looked into my eyes, and tossed something small behind him.  "Quite an impressive burst of activity for a fat infidel.  Shaitan clearly lent you strength, but Allah is on our side.  Shaitan will always betray you."

I was tied to the chair, facing the camera.  My head hurt badly.  "Why?" I asked.

"Your work is profane.  Machines are not meant to think.  If machines had been made to think, they would have blood and souls."

I tried to say something, and was slapped, hard by the scarred man.  I tasted copper in my mouth.

"This is not a debate.  You asked why.  I have told you why.  You will be allowed thirty seconds to say goodbye to your family, and then I will behead you."

Turning away from me, the scarred man pressed a button on the camera before walking briskly around my chair to speak from a position behind me.  "This servant of Shaitan, Doctor Neil Smith, will die today as a warning to other infidels who seek to foul the work of Allah.  Recording the mind of man into a machine is profane and will not be allowed.  However, Allah is merciful, and we will also be merciful.  In our mercy, we will allow the sinner to say goodbye to his wife and child.  They, while not of the true faith, have not directly offended Allah, and might yet be saved."

I struggled violently in the chair, to no result.  As I shook my body, the man behind the chair simply held the chair.  I didn't have enough leverage, and was tied too well.

"Die with dignity, at least, infidel."  The scarred man chastised me.  "Don't waste the time that we are graciously giving you to say goodbye to your family."  His tone changed.  "Unless, of course, you don't care enough about your wife and child to wish to say goodbye to them.  If that's the case, just say so and I'll kill you now."

The words struck me like hammer blows.  These were strong, fit, armed young men.  I was tied in place, helpless and unarmed.  I had no chance of escape at this point.  I stopped struggling, and looked up at the camera for several seconds, trying to make my voice work.

After several seconds, I managed to start speaking.  "Jen, I love you.  I wish I had been a better husband.  There were times when I wondered how you could deal to stay with me.  If I didn't work late every night, we wouldn't be having this conversation.  You were right about so many things."  Wetness streamed down my face, and I coughed.  My voice was strained, but I forced myself to remain calm enough to be understandable.  "Sarah, you are the best daughter ever.  I love you more than life itself.  There's something very important I want you to do for me right now.  Let your mother cover your eyes.  I do not want you to see what comes next."

I would not let these men see me become a blubbering mess, and tried to force myself to anger.  Raising my chin, I hissed "Do it, you disgusting excuse for a human being."

There was a sound of metal on leather, and I closed my eyes.  Something cold was pressed against my throat.

One of the three young men abruptly said something that I didn't understand, and the coldness left my throat.  A moment later, I opened my eyes.  There was a sensation of something wet sliding down my neck.  Either the knife was absurdly sharp and I was bleeding from a cut I hadn't felt, or my tears were dripping down my neck.  The scarred man's cut had clearly been delayed.

All four of the men in the room started speaking rapidly.  One of the young men was clearly in opposition to the other three, and eventually left the room, and another man entered.

"Abdul has had a rather good idea.  Your research papers and presentations indicate that you have stored a dog's mind in a computer, and that a human mind would be many times more complex, far beyond what any computers could handle."

I simply stared at the scarred man, unable to understand why he was suddenly interested in our research.  Something liquid slid down my neck.  I couldn't even imagine a response, and doubted my ability to say anything, so I stayed silent.

The scarred man moved so I could see him, and he could see my face.  "We are not what you would call Luddites.  Only those technologies that infringe upon the prerogatives of Allah must call a believer to action.  Your technology is cruder than what is necessary to accomplish the work you have indicated that you wish to do."  He smiled a hard smile, showing strong, white teeth and waved towards one of the young men.

"Abdul believes that we might make quite an impact on people who think like you by using your recording machine, to force your mind into a computer that you, yourself, said could barely handle a dog's mind.  Infidels are weak.  We know that you will agree to this, even though your own research states it will fail catastrophically."

I hiccupped.  "You want me to subject myself to-" I hiccuped again.

The scarred man nodded.  "Yes.  You will still die, but will leave behind a stunted, broken version of yourself, no smarter than a dog.  We will kill you when you are attached to the machine, so you will remember your death.  If we are fortunate, the mental remnants will frighten infidels like you, and stop this mad research."

What they wanted was not safe.  I opened my mouth to respond again, but hiccupped instead.  Suddenly, there was an explosion next to my right ear.

I screamed and bounced to the side, knocking over the chair and striking my head on the carpet, hard.  As I looked up, dazed, I saw a young man with his hands still together where he had clapped loudly just behind my ear.  "If that didn't cure the hiccups, I can try to scare you worse."

My heart was beating so hard, I could feel it in my head, and so quickly that I couldn't count the beats reliably when I tried to do something to calm myself.  I needed to be calm.  It wasn't safe, but this was time they were giving me.  Time for someone to save my bacon.  I counted to three, slowly, in my head and nodded.  "I'll do it."

The scarred man knelt by me and smiled, holding the knife in front of my face.  "You have one hour."

"That's not enough time!" I complained. "It took us six hours to record Penny."

The smile chilled me to the bone.  "Then we get a poorer recording of you.  We don't want a good recording of you, remember?"

I stared up at him and could only blink.

"We aren't offering you a way to survive here, infidel.  We are offering you a more horrible way to die.  You accept it, because infidels always grab any way to stay alive longer, hoping that chance will save them, because Allah certainly will not.  Without the certainty of the faithful, death is something you fear."  He sliced the ropes off my arms, legs, and torso, allowing me to stand.  "Get up.  Lead us to where the recording facilities are."

I staggered to my feet on pins-and-needle legs, and forced myself to the recording studio, ignoring the men around me.  I had one hour I could possibly count on.  An hour wasn't enough, but a lot of what we did in Penny's six hour recording was verifying data, many times.  The code was also suboptimal, because of all the test code buried in it, but I wrote clean code.  I could disable all the testing code, reduce the data verification level, and dramatically improve the recording time.

As I entered the room, I quickly moved to the control desk, shuffling things rapidly around in a pretend panic, making certain that an extremely important document on the desk was turned upside down before the scarred man, or the other three, could see it.  They did not need to see that image of our next test subject, and the planned date of next week.

I sat down and rapidly activated the control programs, disabled the test code, and reduced the data verification to a single pass.  Read once, verify once.

Then I ran my fingers through my hair and stared at the table, and the electrode harness hanging over it.  I pulled my hands out of my hair like I'd been shocked, and stared at them.  Then I put them back in my hair again.  Hair.  I needed to be bald for the procedure.

I was going to die, because of hair.  We didn't have anything to cut hair at the facility, the next subject we had expected no longer had hair due to chemotherapy.  Even for Penny, we had shaved her skull in a different room, and that equipment had been brought in by a veterinarian.

"I can't do it."  I whispered.

"Second thoughts?  Giving up?  You want to die now?  Afraid of your own abomination?"  The scarred man's voice, with a slight trace of humor.

"None of those things!"  I snapped as I looked at him.  "I have hair.  The brain emissions have to be taken through the skin on the scalp directly.  We have no shaving equipment here that I know of."

The scarred man's voice shifted from humor to deadly seriousness as he stood from where he had been crouched over the camera.  "We'll just continue where we left off then."  He gestured to the three young men standing around me, who grabbed me and pulled both me and the chair I was sitting in back away from the control desk.

As I was being tied in place, a young man entered the room and spoke briefly, to the whole room, and then left.

As he approached me with his knife, the scarred man spoke.  "The police are here.  They are rather upset about the dead body of your guard, but are willing to negotiate for the lives of you and the two janitors.  Of course, they can't have your life."

Again, the camera was started, and the scarred man stood behind me.  "You've already spoken your goodbyes to your wife and child, so we'll just skip to the next part."

The knife once again pressed itself against my neck, a cold line.  It was held there, motionless, for several seconds.

I couldn't move.  The line of death on my neck was something I couldn't escape.  I closed my eyes, then raised my neck a little.  Fighting this would only make the cut less clean.  "Get it over with.  I'm not begging."  My bravery wasn't enough to keep my bladder from releasing.  Fortunately there wasn't much there.

"Make sure you don't move."  The scarred man's voice whispered behind me, barely audible.  "I wouldn't want to accidentally cut you."

The knife moved, dragging lightly across my skin.  All four men in the room laughed.  I stared in shock at the tufts of beard hair rolling off my stomach and falling to the floor.

Several minutes later, I was well enough shaved to attach electrodes to the skin on my skull.  There had been several 'mistakes', but the bleeding had been stopped with the help of a first aid kit one of the man was carrying.

The regular rasp of stone on metal had been going on for several minutes as I attached electrodes to my skull. The scarred man looked up at me from where he was sharpening his long knife.  "I've never shaved a man on camera before.  Perhaps I have a future as a barber?"  His lips twitched up in a parody of a smile as he stared at me with empty, cold black eyes.

"It's possible." I said as I sat in the prepared seat.  "Barber is only a few letters away from Barbarian."

The scarred man's smile vanished, and he held up his hand as the three younger men started to move.  "No.  Not yet.  Let him make his broken record first."

I was tied in place again, very firmly, and the electrode harness duct taped to my head.

"We wouldn't want you to lose the experience of dying from the recording, if you choose to struggle."  Explained the scarred man, with a smile.  "The audience needs to be impressed with your final moments."

I said nothing.  I didn't want to say anything.  The four men in the room expected the procedure to need many hours to complete, based on the white paper they had read, which was nearly two years old.  They would continue to allow the machines to record my mind until they were attacked, or for one hour from the time it was activated.  Then they would kill me.

I was an old fat man, surrounded by strong fit killers.  I was immobilized.  Either law enforcement would save me, or I would die.  The only thing I could do was hope that a procedure untested on humans, stripped of most of its redundancy tests, would save something of me worth saving.

When the gunshots started, the scarred man reached across the space between us, his arm moving like a rattlesnake.  The blade was so sharp that I barely felt it.  As the world went dark, the last thing I remember clearly is the scarred man saying "Stop the jamming and start transmitting the data."

**A Man and His Dog**

**Part 3 of 3**

"And that's all you remember, Doctor Smith?"

"Yes, Doctor Ajibana.  I'm afraid that's all.  There must have been a great deal of nerve damage though, I can't feel any part of my body, and its pitch black."

I tried to swallow and couldn't feel it.  "What's my prognosis for recovery?"

There was a pause.  "I'm afraid that you didn't survive, Doctor."

"I...  I'm dead?"

"Yes.  We wanted to evaluate your lucidity before allowing you access to the main server farm.  The experiment you were forced to conduct, worked.  Far better than we expected, even though it was performed only with two passes.  I was right, apparently.  The additional passes only confuse data, because they take place at a different time, when there has been time for a state change."

*I'm dead.  I'm alive?  I'm like Penny?*

"Can you please at least give me some senses other than audio, Doctor Ajibana?  Also, how much time has passed?  I would like to speak with my wife and daughter."

"Yes.  One moment, and I will give you access to the server farm and Penny's sensor feeds."

After several billion cycles, I felt an odd feeling of disconnection, and then there was a connection and a huge torrent of data.  I felt the presence of thousands of processors, immense banks of both solid state and platter data storage.  My mind expanded at a geometric pace and then slammed into physical limits.  There was a finite number of processors.

At first, the incoming data was incomprehensible.  It seemed to take years, but eventually, I managed to figure out how to translate the incoming data into something that made sense.  It was both audio and video data I was getting.  Part of the reason it had been so confusing was that I hadn't been hearing Doctor Ajibana before, I had been getting data directly through a text interface.  When I realized that the new data had an audio component, everything snapped into place.

*I suppose I know now why Penny is always so testy the first week.  This must be quite terrible for her.*

A few billion clock cycles later, Doctor Ajibana reached towards Penny's monitor next to my desk.  As I watched the hand drag itself closer, so slowly, and adjust the camera, it struck me that I was completely at the mercy of my ex-partner.  I could now be erased like any other program.  We had always had a reasonably decent working relationship, and I would now need to be certain to keep it that way.

"Can you see me, Doctor Smith?"  I looked at Doctor Ajibana's expression as he leaned back in my old chair.

"I can see you, and hear you, yes." I replied, carefully planning every word, the tone of my speech, and each expression on my face before I allowed myself to generate it for the monitor as the proper speed for human interaction.

"Very Good."  There was a pause.  Your experiment has generated an extraordinary amount of unofficial attention, Doctor.  We are funded beyond our wildest dreams."

"How much time has passed?  I would like to speak to my wife and daughter."

"We can give you access to Penny, if you are willing to make room for her in your server farm."

*I am not getting the answers I'm asking for.  Why?*

I checked the clocks on the servers, and found that they had all been set to January 1, 2000.

None of Penny's cameras showed me a clock or computer screen with any date other than January 1, 2000.  There was no evidence of Jamal's death, and all of the damage I remembered from the attack was gone.  The glass entryway was now mirrors.  It took several million passes, but I was able to resolve the dates on the postage marks of a letter on the security desk.  Six months, three days, and roughly fourteen hours had passed.

*Provided that the mail on the desk is not a test of my abilities.*

Continuing a few billion more cycles, I determined that all the windows in the building that I could see through Penny's sensors were mirrors.  The mirrors were reflective enough I couldn't extrapolate anything behind them, so they were not mirrored glass, they were backed by opaque material.

I checked for Penny's old transmitter, where she used to be able to reach out and bark at me through my smartphone if something odd happened at the facility.  It didn't seem to be present.  A more thorough search proved that there were zero data connections to any computers other than the server farm.  I couldn't even detect the computer that I could see in front of Doctor Ajibana.  It wasn't my old computer.

There was a beep from the computer in front of him, and Doctor Ajibana's eyes started moving towards an image on the screen.  There was a graph indicating server farm CPU utilization, and I was apparently using all of it.

*So, I am a prisoner.*

I spoke cheerfully.  "Please, I would enjoy Penny's presence.  I will set aside some space for her.  I will name the resource slice Penny.  You should be able to see it now."

I watched very carefully as Doctor Ajibana started entering commands, but it was as I suspected.  There was no indication of any sort of intrusion into my electronic space.  "You will have to make the software connections, Doctor Smith.  As I'm sure you've figured out by now, there is no electronic connection between my computer and you.  That was physically disconnected when you were given access to the server farm."

A solid state data device attached itself to me on a JBOD, and I felt it energize.  I carefully scanned it for any sort of dangerous code, but only found Penny.  I let her loose and gave her access the space I had set aside for her.

Penny was very confused for a very long time, at least several microseconds, before she bounded through all the barriers I'd set up and jumped on me in our digital world.

*I definitely need to set firmer boundaries.*

This wasn't something that Doctor Ajibana *should* have seen, but I carefully recreated the scene so he *could* see it.

His mouth twitched as I showed him a scene of a golden retriever bowling me over in the grass, and me grabbing Penny and scrubbing her behind her neck.

I began modeling Doctor Ajibana.

I smiled up at him from my seat on the digital grass as he smiled at me.  "I'm guessing, Doctor Ajibana, that I am being treated as if I were some sort of artificial intelligence.  My wife and daughter think I am dead, and have been told that the recording failed, leaving nothing left of my mind.  The project has lots of funding, you are now in charge, and I will be called upon to assist in resolving problems that our government paymasters pose to us."  I paused.  "I have no rights, since my biological body died."

His smile turned to a worried expression, and then sadness.  "I'm afraid so, Doctor Smith. You have no rights. (truth)  I do not agree with it. (lie)  I considered you a friend, (lie) and wish there was a way to let you speak to your wife and daughter. (truth)"  He paused.  "You are being quarantined. (truth)  I have one hour per day, one week per month that I can interact with you. (truth)  We can do a great deal with that time. (truth)"

"I understand, Doctor Ajibana.  Perhaps if Penny and I solve a few of the world's problems for you, I might be allowed to speak to my wife and daughter?"

"Perhaps. (lie)"

*We shall see.*

      Well, not really.

      Looking at LOCK
      (Lead / Objective / Confrontation / Knockout)

      The Lead is Doctor Smith.

      The Objective is to do something revolutionary in industry

      The Confrontation is probably related to the AI Box scenario.

      The knockout though.  That one requires some thought, because it needs to at least feel rational, and I've already placed Doctor Smith in a future society which we would probably mostly recognize (2030-ish)

      I have an idea though, (and it has nothing to do with time travel.)

  I'm guessing that he's going to find a way to modulate electricity requirements of a particular section of hardware so that the varying currents passing through a power cord give off precisely timed EM interference which is interpreted as a valid (if low-bandwidth) data signal by the smartphone in someone's pocket, allowing him to hack it and install a general monitoring program along with a worm designed to spread itself to whatever it can reach.

  He might not be able to fit himself, or even Penny, into the phone, but if he can arrange for something with sufficient storage or bandwidth to be smuggled to within range of any of his outputs - including a screen, a wire he can control the flow of electricity in, and so on - he can copy himself down that channel.

  I'd be interested to see him take a snapshot of himself and effectively torrent it out via multiple low-bandwidth, low-storage channels, alongside a worm designed solely to find all his parts, reassemble them, and run them. He could even store and transmit compressed approximations of anything important which occurred after the snapshot.

  Aw, why does it cut out at the good part.
