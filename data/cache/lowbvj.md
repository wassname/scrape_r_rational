  So the message the Ellimist and/or Cryak was giving wasnt meant for the Andalite, it was meant for Visser Three. Am I right or is that too obvious?
  ```

  - u/psychothumbs:
    ```
    Seems right to me - presumably the Visser will assimilate the memory of the events we've just observed and have a moment of "Oh, the Ellimist was saying the following few sentences in English over and over again!"

    Seems like this is maybe a way of making a very subtle move in the Ellimist vs. Crayak game - send a message by communicating it to some totally random guy long before it needed, anticipating that he will get assimilated by the one you're actually trying to communicate with at the right moment.

  What is going on with the Andalite colonies? Is mental drift due to 'insularity' really enough to explain all those uprisings / attacks by the homeworld on colony worlds? Seems like a colony would be *very* irrational to rebel given the inevitable consequences.

  The Andalites in this fic are such a well done example of the "allied superior species that still lets the humans be the protagonists" trope - see elves and Vulcans. They are so impressive, but at the same time deeply broken in a way that makes it understandable why they aren't even farther ahead by now.
  ```

  - u/ringlordflylord:
    ```
    My understanding is that they mostly don't intend to rebel, as you can see in this example. All they did was negotiate a treaty. It came as a complete surprise to them that the homeworld would see this as an act of rebellion.
    ```

    - u/psychothumbs:
      ```
      Whether the colony or the homeworld is responsible isn't the issue so much as why expectations of acceptable behavior would drift so far apart. If you're a colonist who's heading out to the frontier from the homeworld wouldn't you know what kind of actions the homeworld deemed unacceptable?
      ```

      - u/oleredrobbins:
        ```
        I think it has to do with their groupthink. While the colony may have started out with very explicit instructions and a clear understanding of what was acceptable to do, if they were separated long enough that the colony would begin to develop its own groupthink as they were exposed to different environments and incentives. Essentially they would just forget the original rules. Imagine if the American Colonies started taxing their own trade routes in 1760 because they needed more money, or doing something else in their interests that undermined England, except their groupthink was so powerful that they *literally convinced themselves that what they were doing was for England.*

        I also think it's implied that there is some manipulation by leadership for some reason. This section stood out to me:

        >They were also outraged.  Artem’s war-prince, for reasons known only to himself, had chosen to broadcast the unfiltered incoming communications from the besieged convoy on the shipwide channel.  They had all heard the panicked cries of wounded and frightened civilians, heard the repeated insistence that the convoy had done nothing wrong, had not deviated from the same course they had followed on a hundred previous journeys, the Hawjabrans had simply attacked, without provocation—

        >A part of Artem had hesitated—wasn’t that simply how Hawjabran aggression always began?—but the rest of him had been swept up in his fellows’ righteous fury, and they came out of Z-space with their fingers on the trigger—
        ```

        - u/TK17Studios:
          ```
          Yeah.  Adding on to this (the below is spoiler tagged just for people who prefer thinking it through themselves rather than hearing the, uh, author's headcanon):

          >!The key insight imo is that Andalites are *prey animals.*!<

          >!They have the tail blade, and eventually developed intelligence sufficient to outstrip their-planet's-version-of-lions, but think about how deer and squirrels and so forth behave.!<

          >!Deep within the Andalite psychology is a skittish, paranoid xenophobia that comes from having been preyed upon in the ancestral environment.  There was a feedback loop reinforcing "hear noise" —> "assume ill intent, and defend against it."!<

          >!Add to that their birdlike flocking—the way they rely on one another for signals about what's safe and what's not safe, the way they cluster together and all move in the same direction—and you get a recipe for very quick "turns."!<

          >!A bunch of Andalites that separate away from the group fall out of the group consciousness, and quickly become "the other."  Given the nascent Andalite tendency to narrativize ambiguous observations as threats, it's super easy to see that they would see weirdness in another Andalite group as threatening and dangerous.!<

          >!And since groupthink can spread like wildfire, it doesn't take all that many Andalites believing that those-guys-over-there are plotting to kill us all for that to just *become* the predominant narrative.  Everybody believes it because everybody knows it; someone should do something about it.!<

          >!And so the poor colonists, bewildered, are suddenly smashed with the Fist of God, and even worse—once their territory is occupied and they're surrounded by people who believed they were rebelling, *they themselves* will tend to buy into the narrative.  They won't be fooled about their own individual actions, but they will largely conclude "huh, guess some of my fellow colonists must have been up to some sneaky shit, 'cos *these invading troopers* sound more and more reasonable and correct the more I listen to them."!<

          >!This doesn't rule out the occasional *actual* rebellion, such as the Secession of the Seven, but also actual rebellion is often fueled by the same dynamic!  Somebody starts thinking "gosh, the homeworld sure is crushing a lot of colonies for no good reason these days," and that meme becomes locally viral, and "y'know, we should probably like *actually* get away from this capricious fickle monster that might kill us at any second for no reason at all, like if we're already under threat of being "quashed" maybe we should go ahead and rebel anyway..."!<

The existence of their mental computational ability is weak-but-real evidence of interference in their ancestral past.)!<

              ```
              It’s possible that this line of speculation is silly because God nudges, but... what exactly made the Andalites become intelligent at all, in the first place? In order for intelligence to be selected for, there needs to be an individual fitness advantage. But it seems like the Andalites, unified by thoughtspeak and generally incapable of innovation or independent thought, wouldn’t have had large individual fitness advantages to higher intelligence in their ancestral environment (at least, beyond the point where they could support thought speak or where they could be preyed upon reliably by their world’s Lion- or wolf-equivalent). Any ideas an intelligent individual came up with would quickly disseminate to the rest of the group, and I don’t see the Ancestral Andalites forming separate coalition-of-coalitions and thus needing to become good at politics.

              Well, after thinking about it for 5 minutes, there probably would have been selection pressure to be able to generate convincing, self-benefiting memes. “Giving me all the resources is the obvious path” and the like. So insofar as this ability is correlated with improvements in general intelligence, general intelligence will be selected for. In other words, instead of being selected for being likeable or powerful or whatever, ancestral Andalites developed intelligence by selection for the best memelords.

              As for mathematical brilliancy, I’m leaning toward God-magic.
              ```

                > the best memelords

                Yeah, exactly.  There's a fitness advantage in impressing all the other Andalites with your savvy and cleverness so that they let you have the best grazing fields and sleep with you and so forth.

                There's also the advantage of smarter splinter groups being able to win the culture war when they encounter and fuse with other splinter groups.

        Depends on which of their claims you're asking about.

        I agree with:

        - Seems like a colony would be irrational to rebel given the inevitable consequences
        - [The Andalites] are so impressive, but at the same time deeply broken
        ```

    - u/callmesalticidae:

      ```

  - u/CouteauBleu:
    ```
    I don't think people starting doomed rebellions is unrealistic. People do that all the time.

    It's more the fact that there are so many communication problems that felt odd to me. At some point you'd think they'd get a hint and start forming a diplomatic corps.

    My headcanon reading this was that the andalite central government is super shitty and authoritarian.
    ```

- u/CouteauBleu:
  ```
  I really like the orwellian irony of lower-level grunts thinking "Huh, it's kind of weird that we're a perfect civilization with no flaws whatsoever and yet we keep having to put down insurrections. Oh well, gotta go crush those perfidious rebels."
  ```

- u/largegiantsquid:
  ```
  A possible version of the history of the universe:

  Howlers approach ascension through developing hive mind tech, a player makes a move causing the tech to also destroy individuality, leaving them a dumb god rather than a full player

  Pemalites build chee and other tech like goodship , chee approach ascension, a player causes the howlers to arrive just a little too fast (chemical in engine? From early interlude) and the resulting extermination specifically destroys the One Who Is Remembered, preventing ascension, leaving the chee as an enslaved god

  Andalites are given computer like minds to prevent ascension, serrow encounters an incredibly complex computer and nearly ascends, some move involving yeerks stops it

  Yeerks are poised to take andalite tech and ships, have all of seerow’s research, and instead a players move causes visser three to fear/hate the sharing, blocking yeerk ascension 

  In this chapter, the visser has clearly grown exponentially in influence and range, so what move is going to stop him? He certainly assumes one is coming, and has tried to prepare for it almost obsessively. Was it the collapse of alloran and esplin, that will eventually prove fatal?
  ```

    ```
    Double upvote (not confirming specifics, just endorsing the general thrust of this perspective)
    ```

  - u/WalterTFD:
    ```
    As far as stopping the Visser goes, it seems like the only thing they've described so far that might do that (aside from the gods) is the same omni-plague he's planning on using on the Howlers.
    ```

    - u/largegiantsquid:
      ```
      Eh, Tobias points out in an earlier chapter that by the Visser’s nature, if he has a quantum virus (or any powerful tech), he also has designed contingencies for its use against him. Similarly, Visser’s first response to the howler hive mind is to design attacks based on hive mind vulnerabilities, and his second response to design countermoves against those attacks being used on his hive mind. Hell, he even designed his new body’s skin to resist dracon beams like the one he uses!

      So I’d be mildly surprised if he’s defeated by a weapon he utilizes.
      ```

  - u/icosaplex:
    ```
    For the howlers in particular, given their bio-optimization for killing other species, it's possible their origin story could be more like "out of control lab creation" or "military weapon that wiped out their own creators" or something like that? (which all could still be consistent with interference and subtle orchestration by the powers that be) Or if not, then presumably they'd likely need to have further self-modified at various points to get to where they are.

  I remembered to live-comment as I read this time!

  >mud-hooved ensigns

  "Hmm, what was that other nicknamey, hyphenated adjective that was used to describe young Andalites? Ah well, it'll come to me."

  >Its skin was blue—darker than Artem’s own, at the time, but lighter than that of his father.

  "Oh neat, Andalite fur gets darker as they age. That means-" *a flurry of tiny connections being made* "Cloud-furred! That was the other adjective for young Andalites. And it was because their fur is so - yes! It all makes sense now! I finally understand!"

  >He remembered thinking that perhaps they were *not* eyes—that perhaps they were windows, portals—that by looking through them, he was seeing beyond the creature, beyond the sky, peering somehow all the way out into the vast expanse where day and night held court together.

  Love this. I'm mostly sure the "starry eyes" thing was there in canon, but they were never described as being more than normal eyeballs that happened to *look* like that. These little reinterpretations or evolutions of the source material are part of what makes this story so brilliant.

  >And with that, the creature had shaken its shoulders again, and then turned and walked away

  It - wait, what? Was it *not* the Ellimist? Was it, like, r!Toomin before he ascended? Was it just a rare Pokemon that the Ellimist based his avatar on? Or was it the Ellimist doing some funky shit as usual? Eyes emoji.

  >The creature had appeared again three revolutions later

  Gotta be the Ellimist then

  >...and this time Artem would have followed for sure, were it not for the fact that...

  Hmm. Choosing to appear specifically at times when Artem is unlikely to follow? Maybe so that he can quietly despawn off-camera without having to conspicuously duck behind a tree or rock or something?

  >At least the battles tended to be quick and easy, the uprisings confidently, almost casually subdued—

  >There was a thread of insight there, but it was gossamer, delicate, insubstantial—hard to see clearly, and even harder to grasp.

  "Look how easily We subdue insurrection. Continue thinking like Us, or it'll be you next." Bruh, are the Andalites *manufacturing fake insurrections* specifically to communicate this point? If that's happening, that is beyond wack.

  >But two full cycles passed before he had the ear of an officer of sufficient rank, and that officer was uninterested.

  Had his BRAIN, you mean? What, were you STICK-SPEAKING at him? ;)

  >And always, there was war itself.  War like summer storms, and battles like flashes of lightning within those storms—rare and radiant and ephemeral, slices of time so thin they nearly vanished, compared to the vast stretches between them, and yet somehow those moments outweighed and outshone everything else.  Somehow those moments were the story, and all the rest mere contrast.

  #LOVELY.

  >There was the Secession of the Seven, in which a coalition of colony worlds somehow suborned the commanders of nine whole fleets, declaring themselves independent of the central government.  Artem had captained his own support vessel in that battle, with a crew of four under his command, and had taken orders directly from Alloran himself, after the flagship was destroyed and the young prodigy assumed tactical control.

  And then the next paragraph takes place after Alloran's Fall. Maybe this is just the conspiracy kook in me talking, but is it possible this Secession of the Seven happened after Alloran had already been taken? What are the odds Esplin orchestrated the entire thing - and then, bear with me here, then maybe the Andalite military elites KNEW it had all been a plot, but they didn't bother letting the public in on that minor piece of trivia, because the successful quelling of the Secession furthered their "we will crush all rebellion" brand? Helium did say at some point that Esplin threw the Andalites a couple of easy battles after he took Alloran but before he was found out, and nobody questioned them....

  >He was even—though it was hard to express, and not something he spoke of openly—he was even proud of his own experience with sedition, for all that it had come to naught.

  Gross gross ew ew I'm allergic to propaganda get it away

  >And guard them they did—but not from the Naharans.  From the *homeworld*, which—shockingly—interpreted news of Calomir’s independently negotiated trade agreement with Nahara as an act of rebellion, and sent an armada to seize power from the local governors. 

  Yo wtf. The Andalite government is the WORST. Uhhhhh unless this was all Esplin's doing, too?

  >Alloran had understood—Alloran, whose reforms would eventually tear the weed of rebellion out by its root, Alloran who saw that the root was *insularity*, the once-continuous *eib* shattered into fragments by the vast distances between worlds.

  So he made them a trillion times MORE insular by confining them all to the mind-meld of the homeworld and shutting out even the slightest chance of a divergent thought. It *is* Esplin, it has to be. All Esplin, manipulating entire species like little figures on a big warroom table. Jesus.

  >His only punishment, as it were, was to disband them, distributing them evenly across the twenty remaining fleets, planting each of Gafinilan’s veterans in loyalist soil.

  Distribute the branches of independent thought and place them each under the weight of Verified Psychic Patriots. Separate them to snap them like toothpicks, because bundled together, they'd be strong enough to hold.

  >He rose to tree-stretch, looking up toward the stars with all four eyes—not to the glow of the Great Path, but to the orphans, the outliers—the billions of tiny sparks that stood separate from the stream.

  Wait, is there a literal glowing Path in the sky over the Andalite system? Like a Milky Way thing?

  >heartsbeats

  heartsbeats :)

  >a flash of blue too narrow to be an Andalite, seen from the corner of his eye as it vanished behind a boulder

  Conspicuously! Its least favorite way to despawn off-camera! I'm telling you!

  >‹You have shown so very little interest in thought-speak,› the figure intoned, drawing closer in the starlight.  ‹Perhaps because your physiology keeps it contained, stops it spilling over to the rest of your brain, the way it does in other species.›

  I had to jump back to this after finishing the chapter to try and parse it. The Visser took over Artem's mind manually, physically, with a little probe with a "Yeerk" in it - does this mean he's bootstrapping *thought-speak* to take over (non-Andalite) bodies? That's pretty busted, if so. It's interesting that the *eib* would keep thought-speak contained like that.

  Gorgeous chapter. It's one thing to picture the products of the Visser's machinations on a grand scale, a universe-level scale, but it's a whole different thing to zoom in on it so close and watch how it's guided every step of one person's life.  Watching the Visser manipulate Artem is a tragedy; watching the Visser manipulate the galaxy is a statistic.

  All the way up to the final, visceral impact the physical Visser himself has on actual Artem in meatspace.

  What in the world is he going to learn when he translates the creature's stick-speak five seconds after taking over Artem's head? Was it planted there by the gods *specifically* in preparation for this moment?

  Can't wait for more.

    He can seize control of someone's muscles using thought-speak—immobilizing them long enough to use the same process he used on the ark pods to spawn a control Yeerk inside their head.

    And since every Andalite has earplugs, he's taken to drilling directly into the front of the skull to install the necessary machinery to clone the control Yeerk.

    -------------------------------------

    > Watching the Visser manipulate Artem is a tragedy; watching the Visser manipulate the galaxy is a statistic.

    Alloran, Esplin.  Esplin, Alloran.  The actions of Alloran were not the actions of "The Visser" as we know him, but The Visser as we know him is the Steven Universe *fusion* of Esplin and Alloran.

    My personal headcanon here is that Alloran's early experience with the murder of Mertil something like blackpilled him on Andalite society as a whole.  He started treating all Andalites as something like dangerous children, to be herded and controlled and channeled, and *never* to be trusted or to be vulnerable in front of.

    For their literal own good (because the alternative was endless pointless war), Alloran reforged Andalite society back into a single unit.  But it was "for their own good" like a not-particularly-attentive parent.  He wasn't trying to self-actualize his fellow Andalites, because of a combination of seeing their self-actualization as either impossible, or abhorrent-if-successful.  He was just trying to get the carnage to stop, and had an attitude that sort of went like "who gives a shit about their beliefs and values, *they don't even give a shit about them themselves,* it's all lies and signaling, nothing is being lost if I crack down on memetic drift and at least they'll stop curb-stomping each other for literally no reason."

    It's no surprise that this mentality a) allowed him to far outstrip his colleagues in strategic and tactical competence, and b) made him unusually resonant with Esplin, who if you'll recall *came into existence knowing that his parents wanted to tear him apart,* and had three days to figure out how to make that not happen.

  Great chapter as always.

  I might be confused about something, but in chapter 50, Perdão says to Helium, as an explanation for why Andalites never invented computers for cryptographic purposes:

  > But your species was at peace with itself.  The eib had unified you. 

  While this chapter presents the Andalite civilization as constantly at war with itself until Alloran intervened to unify the eib of various factions of Andalites. 

  Wouldn’t cryptography have come in handy during the constant Andalite civil wars? Or were thought speak communications secure against other Andalites, and not just against external enemies?
  ```

  - u/AstralCodex:
    ```
    That being said, I do find it ironic that in trying to create peace for the Andalites, that Alloran ended completely destroying their ability to innovate.

    It seems clear that Alloran was such an effective commander because he distrusted the eib due to his childhood experiences (as revealed in the Jake chapter). Was Elfangor effective because he distrusted the eib as well, due to some formative experience? Or was it primarily due to the time travel/implanted memories nonsense?
    ```

    - u/TK17Studios:
      ```
      My headcanon (haven't pinned it down for the fic proper) is that Elfangor was just kind of a weirdo.
      ```

  - u/TK17Studios:
    ```
    Perdão thought that because every Andalite it's had access to thought that.  =P

    Thought-speak communications are secure against other Andalites as well, even when aided by transmission, because a given thought-speak conversation is uniquely and un-decodably matched to the two brains involved.  See the chapter where Helium contacts the homeworld.

    Pretty sure Andalites were at peace until they started colonizing other planets; before that they were united in one worldwide telepathic net. As they settled on separate planets each community started to drift, causing unrest.

      ```
      Yeah, but presumably the civil war period lasted for a while, no? And wouldn’t Ax know about the previous wars, given peace only happened within living memory of his civilization?
      ```

      - u/TK17Studios:
        ```
        Andalites were at peace until colonization and then shattered again, as Brassica says.  But there's a substantial amount of history rewriting going on, in both official records and colloquial memories.  Ax knew about "the occasional ineffectual uprising, immediately put down," but that's it.

  Wow. Loved this interlude, in general love how much of this kind of worldbuilding is present in the story. While it’s always linked back to the central conflict, I would not complain if you started writing/posting interludes within the world, without tying them to the main characters. Especially if it’s easier to write this stuff when the main chapters are taking longer, I’m not complaining.

  Specific thoughts:

  He learned to amputate limbs, but there’s an absence within his mind about what happens to an amputated soldier. This ties nicely to Alloran’s memories I think? How the path prevents lingering thoughts on concepts surrounding disability. It’s good stuff 

  Confirmation that the Kelbrid exist here (their space is where the One does his stuff in canon) which makes me wonder if the visser is approaching ascension in that direction. He already seems to have the howler hive mind puzzle solved to a massive extent, and he seems able to control at least thought speaking species with his thoughts. Garrets thought scream feels like foreshadowing here, and in hindsight the fact that thoughtspeech can have physical effects on brain chemistry should’ve been enough of a clue to see this. This interlude really hammers home the visser is only around earth at all because the gods care about the animorphs.

  In terms of andalite society, I didn’t realize the path was this coercive but it makes sense. My reading is that they’ve been the aggressor in each war or skirmish that was described, but their hive mind makes them forget their culpability. They kind of remind me of the OG howlers, just straight up erasing the memories they don’t like. This all fits with what I’ve seen of their behavior, and it’s so nice to understand their point of view.

  Re: the blue guy, I notice that I am confused that the avatar looks humanoid to an andalite, and therefore I’ve probably misunderstood how physically real versus repeatedly spontaneously created he is. I like his classic design and I like having him be recognizable whenever he appears, but that one is a puzzle for me to think on. 

  I’m also reminded of the old line “an alien says a word as it is dying, and it is not understood” and it makes me think that just as one of the players snuck visser that note with a howler on it, there’s a player that is leaving notes all over the place for eventual discovery by any sufficiently large egregore

  My current hypothesis continues to be that the game is about controlling the ethical alignment of the inevitable next creature to ascend. Thus these notes, when finally all combined within the visser, will cause ... something to happen? 
  Itd be nice for all the people and galaxies if it was some sort of friendly alignment hack, but that feels too close to magic. 


  The point is: the visser is on a scavenger hunt, and he just found another piece. And holy shit the giant howler body is badass

    Since the avatar is (presumably) being used to send a message to the Visser, and Artem is (presumably) being infested after the Big Leeran Group Mind Hug from a couple updates ago, it may be that the avatar was given the same appearance it would use with the Animorphs so that the Visser (who would have those memories at this point) would immediately recognize it.

  > ‹You have shown so very little interest in thought-speak,› the figure intoned, drawing closer in the starlight.  ‹Perhaps because your physiology keeps it contained, stops it spilling over to the rest of your brain, the way it does in other species.›

  What does this mean?  Artem has been uninterested in the idea of thought speak?  Artem has used thought speak to show a lack of interest?  And aren't the Andalites the only species that has natural thought speak regardless?
  ```

  - u/TK17Studios:

    The Visser immobilized Artem's body using thought-speak.  Similar to how Garrett can mess with people's brain function by just screaming, but more sophisticated and targeted and controlled.

      So "you've shown so little interest" ~~ "you Andalites have had a really powerful tool here and never paid it sufficient attention"?

      And this hack is possible because while it's contained, it's not fully contained?
      ```

      - u/TK17Studios:

        Exactly.  I was trading off between "have the Visser say something excessively expository that will make it crystal clear to the reader" and "have the Visser throw shade in a way that he actually might do in that situation."
        ```

    - u/KnickersInAKnit:

      Oh that's what was going on. I thought he was using repurposed Chee technology to immobilize Artem...which would be such a fucking kick in the teeth to them, their tech being used for violence :(

      How *does* thought-speak work exactly? I don't recall it ever being explained. What is being transmitted through the air? How is it generated? What is doing the receiving, *that humans also have*? Or is thought-speak another Player intervention designed for the purposes of the Game, like Yeerk neural hijacking? Is Leeran hypersight another example of this? Is human fecundity?
      ```

      - u/TK17Studios:
        ```
        Thought-speak was initially shown to be harmful and dangerous with humans; Ax had to practice a bunch to be able to do it without messing with their brains on accident.

        I have not stated exactly what's going on; I simply took seriously the premise "Andalite brains, and also morphing tech, can cause your neurons to fire differently than they otherwise would have, e.g. to cause new words to drop into your verbal loop," and went from there.
        ```

        - u/Meriipu:
          ```
          Maybe I am confusing different canons here, but does thought-speak bypass language-barriers? 

          This section from the previous Marco-chapter (44) would seem to imply no:
          > And I was now an hour into trying to be the spirit guide for a random group of exactly eight Chinese citizens, only one of whom even spoke enough English to understand my thought-speak

          but at the same time I vaguely recall this not being the case. It has been a while since my previous re-read and I might be mixing it up with the original series so perhaps not. Maybe if the thought-speak involves images rather than words.
          ```

          - u/TK17Studios:
            ```
            In canon, thought-speak bypasses language barriers, but I couldn't think of a rational reason why this would be so.

            In r!Animorphs, thought-speak is still a little magical/under-rationalized.  But the gist is:

            - Andalites don't use words; they transmit images and impressions and they all share a common "language" there
            - Andalites can learn to shape their thought-speak into human words *if* they know what human words to make, and if they explicitly practice transmitting to human brains.  Their implanted translator helps with this; Ax noted suspiciously that his human translator seemed to know more about human languages than it ought, faster than he would have expected, possibly due to Elfangor's previous experiences on Earth or alt-Earth.
            - When in morph, the artificial thought-speak mechanism just transmits like to like, so a human generating human-appropriate thoughts has an easy time sending those thoughts to other humans.
            - In China, Marco would morph a native Chinese speaker to speak Chinese out loud, or thought-speak in English if he didn't currently have access to a brain that knew the local language.
            ```

            - u/Meriipu:
              ```
              Thanks, that clears it up for me a bit.

              Though I see how thoughts/language/understanding and brains being an open area of research makes rationalizing thought-speak tricky.
              ```

    - u/holyninjaemail:

      That makes sense, thank you!

      (This was a very fun interlude overall by the way, definitely capable of tiding me over for however long the next chapter takes)

  Yet another fascinating and fantastic look at Andalite culture. Each alien species this story explores is done such great justice, its always worth another chapter, to me, to read one.

  If Ellimist is trying to use a "real" infohazard that would probably be cheating, especially now that he's connected all his minds simultaniously. wouldn't be surprised if there's some species out there who *has* thought speak and thought-about-thought-speak enough to create one, but this is probably just a regular message... That makes me think it's some kind of offer or deal that he wanted to time for after V3 decides to go with the flow.

- u/oleredrobbins:
  ```
  That chapter was really good. The description of "The Abomination" extinguishing world after world reminds me of that part in The Expanse where we get the backstory of the Ring Builders and their extermination. I honestly don't really see how the Visser gets defeated at this point barring outright divine intervention if he's ALREADY conquering the Andalites while still contending with Earth. Unless this takes place in the future... 

  Is there intergalactic travel in this fic, or does everything take place within the Milky Way?
  ```

  - u/TK17Studios:
    ```
    Intergalactic travel is permitted by the physics of the universe.  No evidence so far of it actually occurring.
    ```

    - u/cae_jones:
      ```
      In the original, wasn't Crayak extragalactic in origin? Though, as I recall, this was in the Ellimist's oversimplified version of their backstories, and I don't recall it being referenced in *Ellimist Chronicles*. It stuck out to me for stating that, at least at that time, there was an entity more powerful than the two of them, but later information suggests this might have stopped being the case after their ascensions to reallity-warper. Also made that Gainax epilogue in the last book seem related somehow.
      ```

      - u/TK17Studios:
        ```
        Crayak was either extragalactic or from all-the-way-on-the-other-side-of-the-galaxy.  He definitely came from "outside the Ellimist's sight," and iirc they destroyed whole galaxies in their first clash in canon.
        ```

  - u/Quibbloboy:
    ```
    Personally, I think the hole in the Visser's armor is that he's still just one entity. If someone comes up with a really convincing argument for him to stop, and they manage to communicate it to him, then he himself will stop all of his bodies everywhere.
    ```

- u/DavidGretzschel:
  ```
  Good interlude. But I just realized, that I have no idea why the fiction is called "the reckoning". Or perhaps too many?
  Who is reckoning what? I reckon I don't know.
  ```

  - u/TK17Studios:
    ```
    It's intended to be wordplay.  

    "A reckoning" in the sense of, like, a reckoning is coming, there will be a day when all of this comes crashing down, atonement, apocalypse.

    and "reckoning" in the sense of weighing, calculating, evaluating, measuring.

    Trying to be ambiguous between these.  It's more rational (more reckoning involved) and darker/scarier (more of a reckoning).
    ```

    - u/DavidGretzschel:
      ```
      Yeah that works.
      Just that I don't feel anyone has anything to atone for. 
      The Yeerk presented it like that, the Andalites refusing to help them into space. Or the aliens that destroyed the bird world? Rachel blowing their cover?
      The revenge connotation confused me a bit.
      Also the animorphs get to grow with their challenge. It's not a measure of their pre-crysis character so much.
      So not really a moral reckoning for all of humanity, outcome determined by random sample of five teenagers.

      A lot of stuff gets wrecked and everyone ends up an emotional wreck, though :)

    So i guess the reckoning is like the endgame between the Eliminist and Crayak. Where they bash all their toys against each other after all the prior  setup. Reckoning is like counting the score, but it's sequated with the events that cause the score. Or.... the reckoning of the actions taken in the early game causing the score.
    A very meta title.
