## [D] Monday General Rationality Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics!  Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world?  Have you:

* Seen something interesting on /r/science?
* Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
* Figured out how to become immortal?
* Constructed artificial general intelligence?
* Read a neat nonfiction book?
* Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?

  What are some good entry-level jobs in STEM I should consider searching for? I recently graduated with bachelor's degrees in physics and math, but have no work experience relevant to those fields. I need to make $2,000 a month to support myself and I've yet to find a decent job on the boards I've subscribed to. 

  The suggestion I've heard more than any other is teaching, but I **really** don't want to be a teacher. I managed to find part-time work as a tutor, but it doesn't pay much. Some people have suggested looking into IT jobs, but while I *can* code I have very little experience and no computer science degree.

  It doesn't help that my social anxiety makes it difficult to market myself. Even writing a cover letter feels like more trouble than it's worth when I'm applying to so many jobs and not getting any callbacks. [Here's a copy of my resume](http://i.imgur.com/eeXqmb6.jpg ) and would really appreciate any suggestions for what I'm doing wrong

    From my experience with interviewing and hiring, the only standout negative aspect of your resume is the lack of work experience. Not particularly helpful, I know (since the only way to add to that is to get hired somewhere), but I'm mentioning it if only to assuage your fears that you're "doing something wrong." Also, if you've been working as a tutor, I would suggest adding that to the list.


    As for specific entry-level jobs, +1 to u/ToBeKing89 's suggestion of Implementation or Technical Support. While support experience helps, many companies prioritize general problem solving skills, professional demeanor, and demonstrated ability to learn (you'll generally be supporting their software, and they don't expect you to know it coming in). Additionally, Technical Support is often a great jumping off point for higher-paying jobs in development, operations, etc.

    Some potential job titles in this sub-field:

    * Technical Support Engineer
    * Customer Success Engineer
    * (Technical) Implementation Engineer
    * Professional Services
    * Technical Account Manager
    ```

    Uh, you *might* want to black out your real name.

      Nope, it's fine. I don't care about my anonymity.
      ```

  - u/ToBeKing89:
    ```
    I would consider something in Software Technology. Most large software companies typically have a shortage of Implementation and Technical Support Staff. 

    They tend to be very well paying jobs in a safe market as I am sure you have heard before.
    ```

    - u/trekie140:
      ```
      What are the job titles? I literally know nothing about this industry and haven't learned any skills specifically related to technical support.
      ```

      - u/Kylinger:
        ```
        Look for "Junior Software Developer", "Junior Software Engineer", Junior Application Developer", "Junior Programming Analyst" and anything else that fits the pattern "Junior #Technology-Noun #Profession-Noun" (If you're looking to write software, that is.)

        Your degree will help (two of my colleagues are math majors) but unless you're familiar with programming it probably won't be quite enough. I'd suggest going through some online training courses. Places like http://codingbat.com/java and Codeacademy.com are both highly structured and were wonderful for when I was learning.

        I hope this helps some!

    Going into IT can get you a pretty decent job in San Francisco, San Jose, or Sacramento. This is how I got my foot in the door in the tech industry and it worked well for me. You can expect a starting salary that is enough to support a single person in the area. Back when I got started, this was 40,000/year with no IT-related credentials, which is enough to survive but (at effectively $20/hr) not a particularly good salary if you are in IT, and quite bad if you go into programming. If you have the skills to get a job in programming, this pays much better. I was not able to get one without a relevant degree or experience at first.

  I've recently gotten out of a bad situation that I've been dealing with to varying degrees for a few years now, and I'm encountering a pattern of thought that I haven't been able to properly disrupt: I'm feeling genuinely, unreservedly happy--so my brain is *panicking*, looking for the clouds that I've oh-so-obviously missed, if I can be so foolish as to think that things are actually looking up. Worse than thinking that everything is awful is being convinced, on some level that I can't talk myself out of, that if I can't see the Bad Things on the horizon then they must be right behind me. 

  Anyone know what might help? I'd like to get rid of this, because it'd be nice to not just be happy but be conscious of my happiness without immediately compromising it. 

  I experience Bipolar-II, a form of bipolar where the lows are not so low, and the highs are not so high, as in the bipolar disorder that most people think of, but they are much more common. This might be relevant. 

  Now that I've finally moved out of a town where my only options for therapy are "Shitty counselors whose jobs I could do for them" and "People who endorse crystal healing, gay conversion therapy, or both," I'm going to see about getting a professional, because there's some other stuff that I need to work on too, but it seems to me like this problem, in particular, might be something that others on this subreddit have had experience with.

    My solution for this might be super weird, but the way I try to correct this bug is to expose myself to anecdotes where things seemed like they could go horribly wrong that don't. That's how I'm able to trick myself into seeing optimism as rational, sometimes things do just work out as you wanted them to. 

    Where this gets weird is that I know my brain interprets enjoyable stories as if they were anecdotes of real events, so I just watch slice of life anime as a way of reassuring my subconscious that it's okay to be content sometimes. Seeing likable character go through life with no major conflicts is soothing.

    *K-On!* helped me get me through the worst string of anxiety attacks I've had in my life and I've heard *School-Live* is interesting in how it shows people being happy in an objectively horrible situation, but the one that seems most applicable to you is *Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid*.

    One of the reoccurring themes of Dragon Maid is how the situation the characters are in could collapse at any moment because of the dragons power and inhuman psychology, but then it doesn't so they all get on with their lives. It helps that the characters and setting are actually quite rational.

    The way I try to approach this is to remember that yes, hings can go wrong but that doesn't make it virtuous or sensible not to enjoy the good times when they happen, so if things seem good right now even a pessimistic approach would be to make the most of that, if that makes sense.

  What's the name of the cognitive biases where people are trying to control the amount of variance/risk in their choices rather than just maximizing expected utility?

  Because the writing skills thread is defunct, I'm going to use this thread to discuss my story each week unless there's a problem with that? (The Friday Off-Topic thread is less convenient for me for Reasons)

  So, here's my weekly random stream of consciousness update about my in-progress rational supernatural romance story:

  After some intense beta reading from my husband and partner, I'm probably going to have to rip the entire thing into tiny pieces and then reassemble it again. (Also, re-reading it after putting it on the shelf for 3-6 months has made me hate parts of it, and made parts of it seem out of place). It's daunting but ultimately the story will be better for it. I'm still not completely satisfied with the major conflict, and I need to live in the main villain's head a bit more too. Plus I need to add more... life to the romance. Fortunately all that crap is in my head, so I just need to put that on the page, so that's easy. 

  So all in all, my coauthor not being available to do any of *her* vitally important edits has been less of an issue than I thought since the whole thing needs a bunch of stuff done to it that I'm perfectly capable of without her.

  And I'm learning a lot about writing rationally and worldbuilding from the story. One big concern that keeps coming up is My Vampires are Different, but because vampires want to keep their differences secret they're not obvious to the reader. But I probably need to make more of those differences "reader-facing". The interlude I posted in this thread last week has done that, at least.

  Finally: because of plot elements that feature heavily in my story, I'm interested in finding an African-American person who is able to give me their opinion on how I've handled them. Preferably someone in the SJW-type camp as I want to err on the side of getting the story *more* ripped to shreds rather than less. This will not require reading the full story (unless you really want to), I would abridge it to include only the stuff I'm most concerned about. (Or if anyone has recommendations for a subreddit or other place I can go to find someone, or knows someone who might be willing to do it).

  I've been thinking about the algorithms that people use in everyday life, and I think I've found two interesting examples:

  **Pathfinding while walking**

  When you are walking from a source to a destination, how do you decide which path to take?  One interesting thing I saw was on street corners with split right-turn lanes like [this](http://imgur.com/6vBYZ7J), almost all people will follow the red/green arrows I drew, and use the marked crosswalk when leaving the intersection, but simply travel straight when entering it.

  I suspect that this is because we see things like "the sidewalk" and "the start of the crosswalk" as *points* instead of areas or lines.  When you are leaving the crosswalk, the fastest route to reach the sidewalk is to turn 45 degrees and follow the marked path.  When you are entering the crosswalk, the fastest path is to travel straight, without going out of your way.

  I haven't put much more thought into this, and wouldn't suggest changing your (or anyone else's) behavior based on it, but I found it interesting nonetheless.

  **Passing and lead distance on highways**

  When you pass someone, you have to merge back in front of them afterwards.  How do you decide *when* to pull back in front of the vehicle you just passed?  I think that most people go until they are in front of the passed vehicle, wait a number of seconds (so that their higher speed opens up a gap), then change lanes.  I thought of this when I went on a roadtrip this summer, and found that people were cutting in front of me *way* closer on divided highways with no pressure to get out of the passing lane than on two lane ones where there might be pressure from oncoming traffic.  It was the difference between a ~0.75 second gap and a >1.5 second gap, on average.

  Any thoughts on those two, or other examples you've seen?

  - u/Frommerman:
    ```
    On the first one, the red path minimizes the distance traveled through the road, and is therefore marginally safer.
    ```

  - u/callmebrotherg:
    ```
    Hm. I would generally use the red line in both cases, but that's because I have a thing for arbitrary rules that have no moral weight but collectively make up a substantial amount of civilization's glue, and am inclined to follow them. 

    Sometimes I still cut across grass rather than the sidewalk when I'm on my college campus, though, so who knows? Maybe my brain just isn't convinced that "don't walk on the grass" is a real rule, or it thinks that the rule is only real in certain cases (I never cut across the grass of individual properties).
    ```

    - u/ulyssessword:
      ```
      >...I have a thing for arbitrary rules that have no moral weight but collectively make up a substantial amount of civilization's glue, and am inclined to follow them. 

      I'm also inclined to follow arbitrary rules, but in this case I value conformity and predictability more.  The drivers *expect* this behavior at this specific corner, and going against their expectations is confusing and bad.
      ```

      - u/callmebrotherg:
        ```
        Nod. What I mean is that I have a tendency to follow these rules even when there are no cars in the area, and I can clearly see that there are none. I'm not sure that most people would consider it reasonable to take the long path in that case.
        ```

        - u/ulyssessword:
          ```
          Yeah, I agree that consistent habits are more valuable than occasional minor gains in efficiency (which is why I use my signal lights in empty parking lots, for example), I just came to a different conclusion as to what the "right" habit is.
          ```
