  Amaryllis is literally Juniper's definition of attractive, and despite being non-human both Fenn and Solace are quite attractive in slightly exotic ways. The whole world is less repressed than ours. The game gave him a book about inter-species sex, and then one companion from each of a variety of races. And yet, Juniper still hasn't realized that this a dating/harem game, not an adventure game.

      You're stretching a little. The bone mage might have warned that he'd sell the party out, but I wouldn't label their interactions as negative overall (and I note you subtly didn't either).

      Then again, there's also a few characters you missed that continue to back up your point. Poul's female companion, who dies while still allied. The guy at the start who pushes them out of the plane. I think there were words exchanged with a male Color Riot soldier in Comfort?

      What's mostly missing, I think, is an encounter with a rude or abrasive woman. Doesn't need to be a "big bad", just someone female who explicitly doesn't care much about the MC one way or the other. As is, I think Aumann's warder is the only female opponent he's faced, and she got an axe to the face before she could say a word.

    - u/Trustworth:
      ```
      Arthur's a counterexample. I don't think we've had a one-on-one conversation between the two in flashback, but he's kind of the opposite of antagonistic in the group settings we have seen. 

      Then again, he's not only dead, but possibly *twice* dead and sent to hell. If that's the price of being nice to Juniper, I understand why not many men are queueing up to be BFFs with him.
      ```

    - u/Agnoman:
      ```
      I'd add Arthur to that list, and actually the rest of his gaming group was almost entirely male and they were good friends of his. Up until Arthur's death anyway. Admittedly that all happened prior to Aerb, where things have been skewed very much the other way (very possibly artificially, given what we know about the game).
      ```

      The bone mage was a woman:

      >“Welcome to the Kindly Bones, I am Magus Bormann,” said the woman with a short bow, palms pressed together. “How may I serve you?”

    >And yet, Juniper still hasn't realized that this a dating/harem game, ~~not~~ *in addition to* an adventure game.

    It's pretty clear the game wants him to act the hero sometimes. At least ostensibly.

    >What on earth did Joon say to Fenn while high on unicorn blood that bumped her *six* loyalty points?

    "I think you’re pretty and sexy and fun and I am sort of a little bit in love with you, and I asked the One True God of this place to make you real in case you weren’t already because you’re also my best friend"? ^(source: chapter 41)
    ```

  - u/petrichorE6:
    ```
    I really want to know what happened btw Joon and Fenn, I like the two's chemistry a lot better than the status quo with amaryllis. Maybe Joon said something about the 0-9 love scale or some promise to always be her friend or something.
    ```

    - u/Kuratius:
      ```
      Fenn wanting to sleep in the same bed as him points to some kind of flag. Maybe he read the book of blood while drunk and told Fenn he was okay with what was written there?

       Is it possible that a soul bond like the one Joon has with Fenn is how Elves get married?
      ```

- u/GriffinJ:
  ```
  I really enjoyed the running "now that we're alone" joke

- u/GriffinJ:
  ```
  It will be interesting to see how Solace will effect the group dynamic, seeing as she's essentially a representative of the new party member instead of one herself. Will she have personal a personal stake outside her duty as a representative? Will there be some sort of mental link to allow for more direct communication with the Doe? This is a really interesting turn.

  >This locus has too little land to induct new druids into the grove,” she said. “It took three deaths to Zorisad Yosivun before we stopped trying to find a kingdom to be our salvation.

  So either this is not literal or all the druids are ancient.
  ```

  - u/nytelios:
    ```
    Depends how druids are inducted. It could be that Solace is the last survivor of the bunch of itinerant druids who traveled with the bottled locus ever since it was presumably translocated because of the Second Empire's genocide. or the locus has a limited amount of druids that can be inducted per acre and the druids, who are seeming like a rather oblivious bunch of amateur inquirers (they could've really used a rationalist druid or is that a contradiction in terms?), kept dying off without recruiting. How long has it been since the end of the Second Empire?

    edit: scratch the latter, quest dialogue implies no druids can been inducted while enbottled.
    ```

  - u/Izeinwinter:
    ```
    Druids of the magical variety you see in RPGs routinely get immunity to senescence. So yes, likely quite old
    ```

- u/MultipartiteMind:
  ```
  (I liked the last line a lot!)

  A thought:  Can only one Zorisad Yosivun be in progress at any one time, per locus rather than per caster?  (If not, then can the caster survive unscathed if it's cancelled before the year ends and the result is delivered?)

  That the caster survives if there's an answer smells like an opportunity for munchkinry--either have questions of increasing specificity/optimism staggered by a few days, with everyone up-the-ladder cancelling their casting once the first one dies, or else--using a year each time--do binary chop, working one's way inward from the most-pessimistic and most-optimistic possibilities.

  Even if it were assumed at first that only a few times would be necessary, switching to a binary chop system--after the first few deaths, confirming the viability of (finding some people for) the worst-case-scenario _first_--could at least postpone the 'suggesting that it's impossible' despair.  Even the time cost should be better than going down-the-ladder, plus that you could have lower-rung people working on helping while you're then searching for better options.  (Even going up-the-ladder (after the first death when being too optimistic) taking a year each time would allow you to maintain full strength (-1) the whole time, until hitting the lower limit, after which you'd still be at full strength -2, with all others capable people presumably able to live 300 years without issues.)

  A brief digression, as I found this mental image amusing:  "All but me have died to Zorisad Yosivun in trying to find a way to evade our imminent destruction!"  "Why, what's the nature of your imminent destruction?"  "All of us dying one by one to Zorisad Yosivun!"  (I don't suppose 'Zorisad Yosivun' is an acronym for something..?)

  The 'too little land to induct new druids into the grove' matter sounds like a major issue that should have been thoroughly avoided at the start, though perhaps unavoidable with the resources at hand at the time.  Other than that, it sits oddly with me that it takes more land to induct a druid than to maintain a druid, rather than there being a capacity limit whereby new druids could migrate in as previous druids died and left space free.
  ```

- u/Jello_Raptor:
  ```
  Those druids could have saved so much time by phrasing their question probabalistically:

  "Find one of the (easiest for the caster to access) points in spacetime such that the point is a solution for argmax(λ loc -> P(restoration of druids | caster is present at loc))"

  Seriously, I am dissapointed. This is so absurdly munchkinable, and pretty safe to boot since it will find you a maxima which must exist. And it doesn't even break the rules about no promises of the future, since it's probabalistically.

  Edit: well "Let S be the set of points in spacetime that are solutions to argmax(λ loc -> P(restoration of druids | caster is present at loc)). Find me a member of S such that every point in S is (as hard or harder for the caster to get to)." Would be better. 

  Seriously, why are wizards the only ones who tend to get hard maths skills.
  ```

  - u/sicutumbo:
    ```
    In-story: People who have little contact with civilization are unlikely to have developed math skills. Wizard equivalents however go to the most advanced centers of learning on the planet.

    In addition, there's no guarantee that the locus thing would understand. And with a year long cast time, and the cost of failure is he death of the caster, there's not much room for experimentation.

    IRL: generally, solving problems using math more advanced than what is taught in high school makes most people's eyes glaze over. We saw some trigonometry in this chapter, but I highly doubt Join will ever solve a problem using calculus.
    ```

    - u/Noumero:
      ```
      > I highly doubt Joon will ever solve a problem using calculus

      u/cthulhuraejepsen, I think it was a challenge.
      ```

      - u/cthulhuraejepsen:
        ```
        Ugh, but I'm bad at calculus. I will try to figure something out though. (Feel free to give me ideas.)
        ```

        - u/Marthinwurer:
          ```
          Would Joon even know calc? He's only 17, and still in high school.
          ```

          - u/InfernoVulpix:
            ```
            He's put enough points into his mental stats to get a pseudo-intelligence injection, so it's quite possible that he now understands maths he never actually learned.
            ```

          - u/cthulhuraejepsen:
            ```
            Joon is modeled as closely on myself at 17 as I thought feasible/reasonable/prudent, and given that, he would be halfway through pre-calc. *However*, that doesn't mean that it would be impossible for him to learn it later on (though it does give me a good excuse not to do any calculus).
            ```

            - u/None:
              ```
              If I may ask, how old are you now? (If you don't want to answer, don't worry about it, or you can be as vague or specific as you like. I'm just curious.)
              ```

              - u/arunciblespoon:
                ```
                I think he should refrain from answering. Maintain the mystery. :)
                ```

  - u/sicutumbo:
    ```
    New chapter. Turns out that not only would druids be highly unlikely to learn calculus at all, but if they did they would likely lose their powers totally if they tried to apply any rigid systematic knowledge towards their own druid abilities.
    ```

- u/adgnatum:
  ```
  Some really sneaky foreshadowing within this chapter.

  For example, the second whole (parenthetical) paragraph is about glove limits and *extradimensional* space. The party is going to sail right on over that key [party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_signing_party) size limit, I suspect.

  A few nice curveballs though: the anthropomorphic cranteks make the final reveal even more of a surprise.

  A purple-aura person who's not a companion. :D

  Two different styles here.

    "Ears", I think.

    More typos:

    I sought those who would (be) willing and someday capable of helping me

    someday be capable (of) finding a permanent solution

    it’s the kind of think(g) you would use
    ```

    - u/cthulhuraejepsen:
      ```
      Fixed all those, thanks (and thanks for posting).
      ```

  - u/SvalbardCaretaker:
    ```
    There was no physical sensation of my body being distorted to fit through (and *shrink* down)

    Should be shrunk/shrunken.
    ```

    - u/cthulhuraejepsen:
      ```
      Fixed that one, though there's something in my writer brain that doesn't quite recognize it as a typo for some reason. Maybe it's ambiguity between a reading of "distorted to shrink down" and "distorted and shrunk down to fit"? I'm not entirely sure.
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        FWIW I have the same feeling. I think you're right, the source is probably that it could be read as either

        >There was no physical sensation of my body being distorted to fit through (and *to* shrink down?) as I entered the bottle,

        or 

        >There was no physical sensation of my body being distorted to fit through (and *being* shrunk down?) as I entered the bottle,

        It's a case where whether the "shrink down" part is subsequent to the "being" or the "to" makes a grammatical difference. (NB: I don't know much about grammar, so take this with a grain of salt. It's just my intuitive feeling.)

        There's a slight difference in semantic content between the two possibilities as well, though nothing that makes an appreciable difference to understanding what's going on.
        ```

  - u/Laborbuch:
    ```
    Another one, u/cthulhuraejepsen

    water *under* the bridge

    Though that might be intentional? I’ve seen it used when the speaker mixed up *water over the dam* and *water under the bridge*. Considering this is Fenn, she might’ve done that intentionally.
    ```

    - u/CannotThinkOfAThing:
      ```
      I read that one as Fenn doing it on purpose.
      ```

    - u/cthulhuraejepsen:
      ```
      I will consider it intentional and in fitting with character, though I honestly can't remember whether it was actually intentional. (The only one that really stuck with me so far was Fenn saying, "if I'm wrong I'll buy a hat", which I still find hilarious.)

  ```
  D'oh! It was right there in the title!

  Thanks for the chapter reminder. I seem to be missing every fourth installment.

  Great writing, I really enjoy it
