  Or, Egomag has a bad day.  This should give people interested in my take on friendly AI something to argue about.

    I was having trouble placing Egomag, and kept coming up with Vice or Vanity or something that wasn't the caliber of the other targets.

    > Everyone was looking at Sam now.  She’d thought DASI had been talking about blue sky ideas for a long term future.

    > “Um.  How soon did you want to start?”

    > “Tomorrow,” said DASI.

    > Black Swan smiled and looked at Sam.  "So do you want to do some good in the world, and help me get rid of some harmful AIs in the process?  I have a little list.“

    > "Uh, who is on it?”

    > “Quintillion, Egomag, Pomegranate, Nile, Minicode, WBM, FT&T, Pursuit Brooklyn, Silverman Bags, Bank of US, Countrigroup, Springs Bismark, Passport, Kingcard, and US Express are a few names you might recognize.”

    - Quintillion is Google
    - Egomag is Facebook
    - Pomegranate is Apple
    - Nile is Amazon
    - Minicode is Microsoft
    - WBM (maybe World Business Machines) is IBM, formerly [International Business Machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM)
    - FT&T (Federal Telephone & Telegraph, probably) is AT&T, originally [American Telephone and Telegraph Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT%26T_Corporation).
    - Pursuit Brooklyn is Chase Manhattan, which in our timeline merged with J.P. Morgan & Co in 2000 to form [JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chase_(bank\))
    - Silverman Bags is [Goldman Sachs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldman_Sachs)
    - Bank of US is [Bank of America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_America), probably, not the [Bank of United States that failed in 1931](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_United_States)
    - Countrigroup is [Citigroup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citigroup)
    - Springs Bismark is [Wells Fargo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Fargo)
    - Passport is [Visa Inc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_Inc.)
    - Kingcard is [MasterCard Incorporated/MasterCard Worldwide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MasterCard)
    - US Express is [the American Express Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Express).

    I'm surprised that DASI's list doesn't have any non-US-based companies. Were they all eliminated previously, or do their names just translate poorly? HSBC would be a nightmare, I'd think, unless Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation could be plausibly named the Shanghai and Hongkong Banking Corporation.

      Nice!  You got them all--Springs Bismark I thought was particularly obscure to anyone not from North Dakota.

      The reason her list doesn't have any non-US corporations is because she's only listing ones she thinks Sam would recognize, and Sam isn't very familiar with them.  The only ones she might recognize on DASI's list would be Sony and Samsung, and I couldn't come up with good equivalent names for those two.

      Edit:  And yes, Pursuit Brooklyn should properly have been merged into AWMellon Pursuit Bank 8-)
