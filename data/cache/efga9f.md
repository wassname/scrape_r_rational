  Nice job breaking it, hero.

    "Breaking it" seems uncharitable. The original situation was entirely terrible - the powers to bring about any utopia were held back to do incremental amounts of good at best, and millions of elves were dying needlessly every year.

    Wrangling godlike powers to create a sustainable utopia is, as we should all be aware, _difficult_, and Charles seems to have mostly managed, if in a somewhat more hasty fashion than he had hoped.

    Yeah, he did a great job of inheriting a Big Brother society of quazi-sociopaths and accidentally emancipating it with a minimum of bloodshed.

  What is the feeling I'm feeling right now?

  Ah yes. I know.

  Horror.

  I love it, though the problem of the elves' mortality is an interesting one... The protagonist basically uplifted a species without testing what would happen when they had immortality or putting any safeguards at all in place (then did it immediately again, with humans). I'm not convinced it doesn't also imply that human psyches aren't stable to millennia of experience with the elves' comments about delivering presents and the case study of the previous Santa, as well... This may actually class as a 'worst possible end' under that reading.
  ```

  - u/Ulmaxes:

    To be fair, the elves only benefited from this. They were right to point out that millennia of menial labor for mature minds is dulling and unacceptable. I'd expect humans to react to long-term mental/physical slavery the same way. They seem to have a codified set of laws, are still a unified people, and have enough compassion to not strike back against humans in any of the clever ways they probably could, given their mastery of the Christmas Spirit. That last part immediately makes this a fantastic end in my book. And I'd have faith that, in helping Charles craft The Last Christmas, they'd maintain that level of care/respect for human life, immediate and future.

      I'm not as convinced. My reading is of the Christmas Spirit as some capricious off shoot of human culture, which is not inherently aligned with human interests. That the elves became less rigid and more functional as they aged doesn't really help me shake the feeling that their values are ultimately so alien to human interests that in mastering them they necessarily are capable of making that judgment call - younger elves certainly aren't.

  > Charles couldn't pretend to understand the first thing about fashion among the elves, but they dressed almost exclusively in red, green, white, gold, and silver.

  Sounds to me like their species/race is colorblind to blue, and the Christmas traditions followed their color scheme. Heck, I wouldâ€™nt be surprised if they could see a bit into infrared.

  As opposed to "Last Christmas", a 2019 movie based on the song by Taylor Swift.

    i'd like to see hollywood make a movie of this

  ```
  >"I want what you want," said Matilda. "If you want me to die, then I want to die."

  Kelvin was rather literal when he said elves could not trust themselves - with *anything*. They've renounced agency entirely, subordinating their preferences to Santa's !

  But what happens if Santa tells elves he wants them to have agency ?
