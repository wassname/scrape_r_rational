  And with that, Arc I is complete!

  The last few weeks have been a hell of a learning experience, and while I'm overall pleased with how the story thus far has come along, there's been a lot of lessons on what to do better going forward.

  I'm planning to write up a bit of a postmortem of Arc I in the next few days, analysing what I liked and where things went wrong. The next chapter won't be going up for a month, as the last few weeks have taught me that I cannot maintain this pace indefinitely while juggling my other obligations. I'm going to take this time to get properly ahead of the update schedule, and hopefully provide more space for the kind of editing that would have caught some of the larger issues (particularly in 'Reclamation').

  I also need to catch up on my correspondence.

  Thanks to everyone who's provided feedback and advice so far. I look forward to posting more in the new year!

  I just got to say, I was really glad when The Line started updating again, and it seems my faith in you was well placed, as every chapter since has improved :)

  Definitely looking forward to catching up on this soon, didn't know it was on chapter 7 already :)

    Hope you enjoy it! I've been reading through The Origin of Species lately, about halfway through at this point and really, *really* enjoying it.

    Fun fact: at the beginning of this chapter, when I was banging my head against the wall, trying to figure out why on earth Rock-types were vulnerable to water, I started skipping ahead through Origin and Ctrl-F'ing "rock" to see if you had already developed a reason.

    You're doing the Lord's work, mate. Thank you!

  how sapient are pokemon in this story? i noticed in the last chapter red's squirtle rolled its eyes in annoyance. that seems more like a mammalian response than an amphibious one, tbh. i would expect an annoyed amphibious turtle to blink its eyes and just stare at its trainer incomprehensibly. not to roll its eyes. that seems like a very mammalian and possibly very human sort of body language. are pokemon in this story just powerful animals? or do they all have a level of intelligence and self awareness similar to humans?
  ```

  - u/RadHominin:
    ```
    Pokemon in this story are sapient creatures, of intelligence *roughly* comparable to that of a human child - the age of said child depending on the species, but seven or eight would be about the baseline. Maybe five for Weedle/Caterpie-type 'mons.

    Edit: Except Magikarp. Nobody knows whether Magikarp is sapient, since it automatically crit-fails everything it ever attempts.

      Whatcha gonna do with Psychic types like Metagross, Alakazam, Mewtwo, Slowking, Uxie, etc.? In canon they're usually a cut above the rest.
      ```

      - u/InfernoVulpix:
        ```
        It *would* be interesting for Psychic Pokemon to be approaching teenager intellect, and for the more powerful Psychics to approach adult intellect.  It would require a noticeably different trainer-Pokemon dynamic for trainers of Psychic Pokemon, to the point where a trainer like Sabrina might be just one among a group of equals.

  Really digging this! Like Red, I also got stuck with the convoluted plan, which means I need more practice in thinking beyond what the narrator tells me. Enjoyed the conversation with Brock and the set up for the next arc. I'm looking forward to see what we learn from being on the road withba capable Leader. :)

  I'm REALLY hoping this ends up being a journey fic with Misty and Brock.
