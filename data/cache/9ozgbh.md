## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  So i'm building my next pokemon fanfic, and i'm having trouble to decide how much power the gym leaders should have and its attributions.

  In my world, 50 years ago kanto and johto seized a war through a pact of non aggresion. At that time, the interregional elite four were created to moderate businees beetween both continents.

  Keep in mind that my worldbuilding is similar to pokemon TooS (my greatest inspiration) and so, pokemons are a real threat to society as a rule. One of the main reasons to seal the pact was for better disposal of resources against the wild.


  The first thing i thought was to simply use leaders and elite four as some sort of president/governor, but i'm not so sure. Ideas are welcome.

    So would most of the elite four's power be with Pokemon. You could have they have the authority to take charge of local response teams if there is a reason to believe in danger from the local Pokemon. They would also presumably be important in helping decide longer term measures, so their suggestions probably carry surprising weight in all manner of things. I assume they would help plan any emergency plans, as well as things like if certain actions are too likely to annoy Pokemon such as mining to be dangerous. They probably have large authority in immediate disasters and significant weight if they can explain why something is an unacceptable risk. This is just first thoughts though, I kinda need to leave now.

    What's the impact of this decision on the story you want to tell? I think explicitly considering this impact could help your decision.

    Perhaps even consider setting your story in the same world as TOoS (effectively making it a fanfic fanfic, I guess)? Daystar has already described a believable system.

      ```
      Is there some place or chapter that he explicit tells us how the dynamic between leaders and mayors work?
      I understand that leaders are to some extend both executive and judicial power, since they can manage man power, take decisions on how to spend resouces and judge crimes. But if they do so, what mayors are for?
      Who create the laws?

       But how does the rangers works on that equasion? They have some judge power when it comes to renegates at least.
      ```

      - u/I_Probably_Think:
        ```
        I haven't personally paid a whole lot of attention to that aspect and so may be overestimating how much he's mentioned/hinted in the story! How much detail do you need for your own story, though? It's definitely a fun topic to consider, in any case. Perhaps think about where the gym leader system comes from? Why are there gym leaders?
        ```

    ```
    Cease not seize
    ```
