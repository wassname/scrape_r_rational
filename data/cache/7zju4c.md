    Thank you for your commitment to accountability! I've been refreshing reddit and AO all day, and this was the second-best thing I could have hoped for.

    And please take care of yourself. This story is worth waiting for no matter how long it takes.

  Mods, this is my attempt to meet the requests of readers who wanted heads-ups whenever possible, without JUST having a totally valueless thread.  LMK if e.g. I should instead always wait until Friday off-topic or something.

  My life is getting worse in roughly the same spirit as the characters' lives, though thankfully with vastly lower stakes.

    Also, I'm having problems with the Tobias and Ax covers because I became less and less satisfied with the r!Andalite bodies the more I looked at it (despite the artist being, as you can clearly see, amazing).

    Sorry to hear about your troubles <3

  It's funny, I recently realized that making these kinds of pledges (I will have finished X by next week/month or else) was making me *less* productive, and made me miss more deadlines on average.

  For now I'm just trying to do the most I can day by day, and avoid deadlines whenever possible (which is why I've stopped posting updates on my game project, even though I'm still making progress). I don't know at all if the same would apply to you or if you have a different mindset, but... I mean, if you feel like your life is going Game-of-Thrones bad, maybe you should just try to let go a little?

  I say that as the guy who really want the next Animorphs update as soon as possible.

  Obviously the second image is supposed to be Marco, but the hunched over body language immediately made me think Garrett.

  Apologies if this is answered in the story and I forgot, but can I assume that the characters in the images are younger as a consequence of the timeline being different than canon? Or am I misremembering the age of the earliest Animorphs cover models?

    Mostly it's just that it's hard to find images, period.  The r!Animorphs are high school freshmen.  When I had to choose between exactly the right age (but the wrong expression) or exactly the right "feel" (but the wrong age), I went with the latter.
    ```

  - u/CouteauBleu:
    ```
    Canon Animorphs is a bit vague on the subject, but at some point in the final arc Jake clearly states they were 13 at the beginning of the series and 16 at the end (not counting the epilogue).
    ```
