    > I was pretty disappointed with the second trilogy though. I have hope he can redeem the whole thing with the final book, if the assholes at his publisher ever decide to actually release it. I heard its been finished for years, just waiting for publication.
    > 

    There have been a lot of rumors on it but no one really knew what was going on. 

    What we do know is that the final manuscript has been split into two and the first part *The Great Ordeal* has a release date. So the end is nigh

    I'm actually more invested in the end of this trilogy. It's been like a great big metaphysical detective story and I want the reveal. Withholding Kellhus also spared us some of his more annoying  traits.

      Ah, I'm glad that's the case. It's been too long.

      I agree that it was the right choice to remove Kellhus as a POV character, but not because I found him annoying or anything. I actually think he's one of the best written "super genius" type characters I can think of. 

      No, by removing his POV the author was able to really emphasize how alien and utterly inhuman he is, as well as enabling my favorite aspect of the new series; I really enjoy the mystery revolving what his goals and motivations actually are— I'll leave it at that to forgo any possible spoilers. 

      What's your problem with Kellhus? And what did you think of the new series, thus far?

        >What's your problem with Kellhus?

        I just...didn't like him. I was fascinated by his outlook in theory but he's kind of a dick and easy to root against, especially when we get into his sermons or he starts fucking with actually likable characters.

        Removing his POV and leaving everyone in the dark about why he does what he did made him infinitely more tolerable. It also cut out more didactic elements of his character (the above-mentioned sermons and lectures) which had ran their course.


        >And what did you think of the new series, thus far?

        I enjoyed it a lot. I don't really think that there's a new element I didn't like. The Skin-Eaters, Mimara, the issues with the Gods. Well...maybe Momemn is shaky? I'll wait to see how that ends. 

        May I ask what turned you off it?

          It's been a while since I've read the books(5 years!) so my memory is fuzzy, but I recall that the whole thing was too grimdark, I had trouble relating with the new cast of POV characters, even Achamian, and the plot was progressing too slowly. Everything that's happening is merely a prelude to the second apocalypse, which will be in its own trilogy(IIRC). A lot of plot threads seem very trivial with that in mind. It's like this whole trilogy is suffering from "middle book syndrome", basically.

  About a hundred pages from finishing the first book. Excelent fantasy. 


  Reason I picked it up in the first place is that my favorite author, Steven Erikson, apparently loves it as well.

  I tried starting the first book and found it poorly written, overly obscure, full of things which happen for no rational reason, full of things which make no sense and people acting in *extremely* unreasonable ways, and also mildly offensive (rape, pedophilia etc).

  At the point I got to, after a prologue with gratuitous pedophilia, some guy sets out on an important mission (leaving behind some mystical order which then commits mass suicide -- or do they? It's **cryptic**.) without any supplies, or a map, or any idea where he's going. He then wanders along in the wilderness for an unreasonably long sounding time, while apparently in some kind of drug haze, without doing anything like trying to figure out where he's going or finding food or shelter. He then gets found by some hermit, who he proceeds to think he's much more intelligent than (despite not being intelligent enough to have a map, supplies, a destination, or wilderness skills) and manipulate. At that point I quit.

  Did I not get far enough? Or is this one of those things where the author is so obscure that people who don't really understand it (because there is nothing *to* understand but cryptic nonsense) feel moved to praise it (as seems to commonly be the case with highly rated movies by directors like Nolan and Lynch)?

    > 

    They don't give him enough food because the maps are literally 2000 years old and the scale has been lost. (And him dying might not be a tragedy for other reasons that aren't obvious early on)

    He doesn't know what to do because, again, it's a hermit order that's been within the walls for millenia. He finds the outside world discombobulating as a result. 

    The whole issue of just who died is not cryptic at all, it's quite clearly everyone that was contacted for reasons that are gone into.

    I mean, I fully understand the criticisms about the prose and how the work has some hard to read elements but these early "issues" strike me as the least of it.
