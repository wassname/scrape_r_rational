## [D] Harry Potter and the Natural 20?

### Post:

I've just blazed through [Harry Potter and the Natural 20](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/72/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20) and loved it, despite knowing almost nothing about D&D; it started off as just a bit of comedy but grew into something surprisingly brilliant. In terms of rational Magic stories, it goes right up there with;

1) [Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality](http://www.hpmor.com/)

2) [Unsong](http://unsongbook.com/)

3) [Ra](https://qntm.org/ra)

4) [Harry Potter and the Natural 20](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20)

5) [Significant Digits](http://www.anarchyishyperbole.com/p/significant-digits.html)

So first off, if that's the ranking I gave, what would be the natural next thing to read, in terms of rational magic fiction? I'm eager for more.

But my real question is - **what's happening with Harry Potter and the Natural 20**? There was nothing for three years, then a new chapter that ended on a clfifhanger five months ago, then no further updates.

  Two of the most popular fics on this sub right now, [Mother of Learning](https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/1/Mother-of-Learning) and [Worth the Candle](https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/25740126), contain a great deal of rational magic (and, in the later case, RPG logic). 

  But, I mean, it's hard to find a rationalfic that *doesn't*.

  You should probably take a look at Saga of Soul, if you're looking for rational magical fiction that is our-world adjacent; following that, probably Mother of Learning and/or Worth the Candle if you have a taste for litrpgs.

    Saga of Soul is also good if you want another fic that stopped updating.

  Sir Poley said he's coming back to it but..... *shrug*

  He's writing some rpg books and adventures lately. I really like one of his D&D 5e adventures

  "Worth The Candle"  
  "The Erogamer", a quest over at QQ (extremely NSFW)

  Thanks for the introduction to this one.  About halfway through so far, great for killing time.

  My main issue, though, is that the main character is quite well optimized, but the people back in his world aren't at all.  Somewhat spoilery, but EVERY adventurer and NPC over a certain level will be rocking an item of *Protection from Alignment* out of necessity to avoid extremely common mind control and rather common possession effects.  Nevermind that action economy is a thing, which is why groups of adventures can gang up on an otherwise more powerful singular for and bring it down.  It's like his world suddenly stops following it's own rules.

    > but the people back in his world aren't at all

    but...yeah...

    The point is that everyone else is an NPC or a "normal" PC in a typical world as would be created by a DM, and Milo is a munchkin

    Hello! This is me. I'm sorry to say the project is on hiatus for the time being; I've only got so much time to write things and I don't want to spend it all on fan fiction. Part of the problem is time--as the story gets bigger and more complicated, it takes substantially longer to write. I wrote the first three chapters in an evening procrastinating for an early Roman empire final; more recent chapters take days or weeks just because of all the threads and characters I need to consider.  

    I can understand your disappointment with the lack of updates, and if I'm honest, I'm pretty disappointed too. I started the story for a park and never intended for it to be hanging over me like this.  
    Ii *will* finish it, and people can stop worrying if I'm dead. I'm young and healthy and not going anywhere any time soon. It's just slipped to a lower priority because as much as I love it, its not something I can really put on a resume, you know?  

    You can check my Tumblr or Twitter for updates. I'll be sure to let people know there when the next chapter is out

      I'm just here to say that I came for DnD munckinry lulz and stayed for Hannah and Fiona. 

      Thanks for the awesome story.

  Dunno how rational it is but if you're looking for a magical crackfic, TGWP probably fits the bill. Note though that it ends on what I'd describe as a cliffhanger but everyone else seems to find a perfectly legitimate ending for a book.

  Have you read the wiki?

  - u/renegadeduck:
    ```
    For those who are wondering, TGWP is [The Games We Play](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/RyuugisTheGamesWePlay), a fanfiction crossover of [RWBY](https://roosterteeth.com/series/rwby) and [The Gamer](https://www.webtoons.com/en/fantasy/the-gamer/list?title_no=88&page=1).

    I think it ended on a cliffhanger because it was supposed to have a sequel called "the lies we tell" that never really ended up happening as far as I can tell.
    ```

    - u/appropriate-username:
      ```
      Right but people acted like it was some kind of a satisfactory ending for a standalone novel, like a Harry Potter book that ended but still had a few sequels ahead of it but IMO there are far too many threads still left hanging for it to have reached that kind of end.
      ```

      - u/vakusdrake:
        ```
        Yeah I agree that if a book is _so obviously_ setting up a sequel then you can't actually consider it complete in the absence of said sequel.
        ```

    Aaaaah. You got my hopes up. Thought this was a link to new chapter. Then I saw the ?.

    Anyways, I'm pretty sure HPN20 is dead, and that the author just doesn't want to admit it because he spent so much time writing it already.

    If I'm wrong, @sirpoley can come over here and set the record straight.

    Uh the tagging/pinging/whatever it's called here isn't working.

      Pinging works by writing /u/<username>, e.g. /u/sirpoley.

        Please let it not be dead. It was such a joy to read.
        ```

    - u/ricree:
      ```
      He posted a new chapter sometime last year, so it isn't quite dead, but don't count on it getting regular updates anytime soon.
      ```
