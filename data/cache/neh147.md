## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  What are some rational/rationalist works that are focused around autocratic factions/governments, specifically from the perspective of the autocrat(s)?

    not exactly what you mean, but Discworld series by Terry Pratchett features a character, The Patritian, who is a hyper-rationalist/utilitarian autocrat, and rules a city state with an ~~iron fist~~   exactly measured and impassionately pragmatic fist.  


    He is rationalist and utilitarian almost to the point of parody. He has exactly 2 traits that are not optimised for rational practicality: his love for crossword puzzles, and his hate of mimes.

  Once more requesting nonfiction "old man yells at cloud" books. I want angry or passionate books written about ultraspecific niche subjects: microhistories, biographies about people who you wouldn't expect biographies to be written of, polemics about tiny meaningless problems, etc. Books about or written by people who really care about Thing That Nobody Cares About.

  Also looking for good nonfiction books in general. What nonfiction books do you feel have had a deep impact on you or your life? Do you know any people who have solid lists of recommended nonfiction? (Gwern, Yudowsky, authors/bloggers/anybody else with good nonfiction shill lists, stuff like that).

    You could take a look at [these recommended books by Alan Kay](https://mostrecommendedbooks.com/alan-kay-books). If you haven't read it already, I recommend [The Power Broker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Power_Broker) by Robert Caro, and if you have read it, [his series on LBJ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Years_of_Lyndon_Johnson). Haven't heard of anyone who didn't get into those who is even slightly interested in nonfiction and got started with them.

    I'd also recommend [The Devil in the White City](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0041OT8O0/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1), which is a true achievement. It weaves together the story of the people who put together the Chicago World's Fair with the true story of a prolific serial killer who preyed on young women at the fair.

    Edit: missed your yells at clouds angle, though honestly the above will be more useful to more people. But you could try [How Equal Temperament Ruined Harmony](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001ULOPUY/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1), definitely a yells at clouds book but also pretty good. I'm very anti-monopoly and enjoyed [The Curse of Bigness](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HRLQSLG/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1) on the modern tech trusts.

      If you enjoy historical nonfiction like *The Devil in the White City*, then I highly recommend *[The River of Doubt](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/78508.The_River_of_Doubt)*. It's the true story of Theodore Roosevelt's disastrous expedition to map an uncharted river in the Amazon. 

      Like *The Devil in the White City*, all of the dialogue and events in the novel are taken completely unaltered from historical documents such as diaries and letters. All in all, it's a very inspiring, but also cautionary tale about the furthest limits of human ambition.

      From the blurb:

      >After his humiliating election defeat in 1912, Roosevelt set his sights on the most punishing physical challenge he could find, the first descent of an unmapped, rapids-choked tributary of the Amazon. Together with his son Kermit and Brazil’s most famous explorer, Cândido Mariano da Silva Rondon, Roosevelt accomplished a feat so great that many at the time refused to believe it. In the process, he changed the map of the western hemisphere forever.

      >Along the way, Roosevelt and his men faced an unbelievable series of hardships, losing their canoes and supplies to punishing whitewater rapids, and enduring starvation, Indian attack, disease, drowning, and a murder within their own ranks. Three men died, and Roosevelt was brought to the brink of suicide. *The River of Doubt* brings alive these extraordinary events in a powerful nonfiction narrative thriller that happens to feature one of the most famous Americans who ever lived.

    Oh man, it's not surprising these books were never translated, but there's a woman named Maria Romanushko who wrote four (!) books about a (relatively obscure even on the post-USSR territory) Soviet mime [Leonid Yengibarov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonid_Yengibarov). I can try to find an EPUB or something so you can check it out via DeepL (it handles Russian rather well) if you want to. It absolutely blew my mind several years ago that someone was obsessed enough to produce four published books.

    [Cigarettes are Sublime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cigarettes_are_Sublime) is perhaps up your alley in terms of being a weird, esoteric undertaking that Nobody Really Cares About. Basically a defense of the cultural value of cigarettes, their literary value, iconicity and symbolic virtues, written by a French professor trying to quite his own smoking habit. The whole thing kind of feels like an ironic joke, carried out in a very serious and thorough manner.

    I read a lot of non fiction, but I do it with a purpose, to gather / learn specific information   / skills. I build my TBR list from various sources across many of my interests (no I'm not comfortable sharing it). When somebody you like recs or mentions a book google it and add the amazon / goodreads page to a favorites folder. At least that's how I started.

  - u/loltimetodie_:
    ```
    First non-fiction book I'd reccommend to anyone, which I read at the end of high school, and stayed with me for a while, is **Autumn in the Heavenly Kingdom** (found [here](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/131825/autumn-in-the-heavenly-kingdom-by-stephen-r-platt/)). It's a history of the Taiping Rebellion, the biggest war in the 19th century that you've probably never heard of. 

    Fanstastically gripping and readable, expertly weaves the social and economic background in with the more biographical story of the christian-prophet-modernizer-king who rose out of nothing to the head of one of the bloodiest revolts in human history, and transitions seamlessly to incorporating grand overviews of the military campaigns and international politics without losing sight of the individuals - generals, ambassadors, mercenaries, priests - involved.

    I feel obligated to point out that the skill point system only plays a tiny, tiny part of worth the candle. Like I honestly can't remember the last time that gaining points in a skill was remotely part of the plot. Juniper maxes everything he can fairly quickly and then the only relevant part is unlocking new skills/magics.

    His skills are important, but it's only in abstract, there's no number games. If that's the only reason you didn't read it then you're missing out on a really great story.

    If you can take translated Chinese webnovels, try Absolute Choice. It is incomplete and abandoned, but pretty big. 

    It is sort of a Chinese parody on Japanese tropes.

    Official synopsis:

    >A world filled with heroes with superpowers. A world attacked by calamity fiends. A modern world filled with wonders and dangers. 

    >Shi Xiaobai, a child from normal Earth, walked into such a world, proclaiming to be its king. But at the first signs of danger, he is forced to make a choice, one which he cannot refuse for time would repeat, making him face the choice again. 

    >He is not humble nor is he modest, but neither is he delusional. Yet, the Absolute Choice seems to make fun of him. Will the joke be on him or will he laugh at his opponents? There will be many watching his escapades, and there will be some joining him in his adventures. 

    >To see through the world and to grasp its truth, that is the destiny of the King.

    Due to a certain reason he presents himself as an extreme [Chūnibyō](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%C5%ABniby%C5%8D). 

    There are some plot holes, but overall author tried pretty hard to give explanations and keep stuff internally consistent. 

    Sample from the story:

    >Before crossing over, he held a Seven Star Holy Sword in his hand while wearing Gold Dragonscale Armor. He stood on a Ten Thousand Tribulation Qilin, and he was battling the ultimate Great Demon God that was devouring the world. He remembered that, at his final moment, he had consumed his life force in a burning flame, issuing ‘Excalibur’, immediately causing widespread destruction. The Demon God was annihilated. But at the same time, he was completely exhausted, resulting in him dying—in a game.

    >When Shi Xiaobai thought of this, he sighed. “What I, Shi Xiaobai, was playing was not a game, but life.”

    [The Adventures of Kotohime](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6867562/1/The-Adventures-of-Kotohime) is a Touhou fanfic centered on the very minor PC-98  side character of Kotohime, a princess who's also a police officer, where she's basically treated as Emperor Norton by everyone else. Actually has a pretty good plot.

    Since you enjoy the *Discword* novels and *Good Omens*, you might like *[One for the Morning Glory](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/152328.One_for_the_Morning_Glory).* It's a whimsical fantasy novel that good-naturedly pokes fun at common tropes such as renaming items to sound fantastical, ancient tomes with knowledge better left hidden, unclear prophecies, etc.

    In regards to Harry Potter fanfiction, you might like ["A Mother In Law's Love"](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4905771/1/A-Mother-In-Law-s-Love). It's a satire of soulbond fics with a bawdy style of humor similar to "A Black Comedy". ["Honey"](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9268425/1/Honey) is also a great HP fic which had me laughing out loud on multiple occasions (it's an excellent satire of manipulative-Dumbledore fics.)

    I'm having a lot of fun with [There is no Epic Loot here, Only Puns](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/15935/there-is-no-epic-loot-here-only-puns).

    The story is dungeon core / litRPG fiction. It has occasional spelling and grammar issues, and is written at about Young Adult audience level. The author seems to have some fuzziness on their world's mechanics. A frequent theme is the experience of adventure as something cool vs min/maxing. The author appears to be pretty solidly on the side of play experience.

  a couple of threads back someone discussed how D. D. Webb's new fiction, Only Villains Do That, was kind of sexist and how that was weird because his previous work The Gods are Bastards was pretty progressive and even had an mc who was a paladin from the goddess of war and feminism. so, has that changed since? because the tvtropes says: "Equal-Opportunity Evil: Seiji has shown disgust at the sexism and racism present in Ephemera, and judging by the reactions of the other bandits he treated the goblins considerably better than most do."
  ```

  - u/sprague-grundy:
    ```
    I read most of what's published.  The setting is an isekai world with quasi-medieval tech and social arrangements.  As a result, many tropes from isekai (e.g. >!the hero having a harem!<) and ways in which historical society sucked for women (>!power imbalances, limited professional opportunities aside from adventuring, access to resources mediated by men in their life!<) come up a lot.

    The author (to my read) goes to pains to try and present these things as bad, both narratively and from the MC's modern point view.  He also tries to present the women in the universe as people with agency who've been dealt a shitty hand rather than oppressed props to be saved.

    I didn't read the discussion you're talking about last week, but if you're asking because mid-1900s-style sexism in SF/F bothers you, there's nothing like that in the story that will prevent you from enjoying it.  If you're asking because you explicitly liked the way The Gods Are Bastards built a fantasy world that included a lot of modern/progressive/feminist social norms baked into the worldbuilding, this new story probably won't give you that.  (>!Although we'll have to see what happens, it seems like the MC is planning to build a more modern/progressive/feminist social order, so maybe in a few months the plot will be more of that.!<)
    ```

  - u/Aqua-dabbing:
    ```
    > so, has that changed since?

    I've been following this story since then and I love it. I think its sexism status has not changed, but it wasn't really as bad as you seem to remember.

    As far as I understood from the thread at the time, the sexist thing that it does is to portray violence from men towards women as uniquely bad, and appeal to royalroad "white knight" sensitivities a lot. I agree that is sexist, but is not the usual kind of sexist.

    Other than that, it depicts an incredibly sexist (and racist, and speciesist; and overall miserable) society. The protagonist is a modern-day Japanese protagonist that is kind of an asshole but not a terrible guy overall, so he is much less sexist than the setting (if at all).

    The hero (not the protagonist) has a harem, which is sexist, but is there to follow Isekai tropes humorously.
    ```

    - u/sephirothrr:
      ```
      >  hero (not the protagonist) has a harem

      I mean, does he actually, or are you just using that as shorthand for "all-female party"
      ```

      - u/Aqua-dabbing:
        ```
        I'm using it in the same sense as harem anime, where the male protagonist does not have a [literal harem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harem), but there are a bunch of female main characters who may or may not be romantically involved with the protagonist in the future.

        The hero's party members are technically not all female, but pretty much. Also [the author calls it a harem as well](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/40182/only-villains-do-that/chapter/674405/bonus-2-in-which-the-heros-harem-go-to-bible-study)

        Technically it is not
        ```

  - u/fassina2:
    ```
    If you know the author isn't sexist it wouldn't matter even if the work was sexist. I don't think it is though. If it was and you know the author isn't sexist you should just assume he has a point to make, or a particular theme he wants to portray..

    &#x200B;

    I also don't get the people that complain about this kind of thing, most literature made before 1980s was sexist, with sexist authors, people still enjoy them and call some classics..
    ```

    - u/PastafarianGames:
      ```
      Generally I'd say that it's possible to criticize a literary work for its sexism while also enjoying it and/or calling it a classic. (Though most of the classics suck. Bite me, Wuthering Heights, you were shit when you were written and you've always been shit!) I can acknowledge the seminal place of Asimov in SF literature while also complaining that his writing is sexist as all fuck, and don't even get me started on Heinlein.
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        While it is indeed possible to criticize a classic literary work for sexism, it's also a meaningless criticism. You might as well be trying to criticizing Shakesphere's works for not following modern grammatical conventions.
        ```

        - u/PastafarianGames:
          ```
          Nah, that's bullshit. Grammatical conventions are a combination of arbitrary trends and a shared framework for convenient communication; the comparison to sexism is nonsense. It's more like criticizing Newton's works on alchemy for being scientifically inaccurate, or Plato's Republic for relying on slavery.
          ```

          - u/None:
            ```
            Societal roles are also a combination of arbitrary trends, which is exactly my point. 

            It's not like those classical works were making moral statements or judgements about the role of women, they were just reflective of the same societal roles that were common at that point in history.
            ```

            - u/PastafarianGames:
              ```
              Societal roles aren't arbitrary at all in that sense; they're a reflection of the power dynamics of society. And in every society, there are plenty of people pointing out the nonsense of them, and at every timeframe of humanity there are less-fucked societies you can point to and say "Hey, this society is less fucked, why weren't you like that".

              And you get silence, because they are all dead, of course.
              ```

              - u/None:
                ```
                You are postulating a universal set of "correct" social roles. There's no such thing.
                ```

      - u/fassina2:
        ```
        Yes definitely criticizing something and enjoying it aren't mutually exclusive. But what I was referring here was more in a sense of 'not reading it because of the criticism', imho that's not optimal for many reasons.

        &#x200B;

        In my view a work being 'insert criticism here' should not dissuade people from reading. Sure keep the criticism in mind let it alter your interpretation, avoid supporting the author if you feel the need to, but do not let it keep you from experiencing different types of fiction that could inspire you to create something new and fresh.
        ```

    - u/incamaDaddy:
      ```
      i agree with you. but i haven't read either of the author's works, just heard about them, so i can't speak for his character. and i actually have trouble reading some older fiction because of the sexism/racism/religious-prejudice thing, i have no problem when they don't focus too much on it and generally will ignore it and read them anyway if they do, but it does negatively impact my enjoyment enough that i prefer newer fiction.

      Edit: to clarify, i tried reading The Gods are Bastards some years back, but couldn't get into it because while i like the "Loads and Loads of Characters" trope i dislike stories with too many MCs/POVs.
      ```

      - u/fassina2:
        ```
        I agree I prefer newer fiction too, but mainly for a different reason. Imho writers have been getting better overtime because they learn and take inspiration from writers that came before them, a kind of writing tech if you will. So stories today tend to have better characters, editing and plots.
        ```

        - u/incamaDaddy:
          ```
          that's 100% true too. and I also feel newer fiction has characters way more relatable to our current cultural values and the ability to deconstruct tropes set by older works. Standing on the shoulders of giants and all that.

  Schild's Ladder. Really good, really out there ideas. Based on hard sci-fi yet ends up with things far more novel than any soft sci fi. Perhaps the most alien xenobiology that someone's actually tried to describe. Nice ideas about the far future. I liked the description of The Silencer physics laboratory.
  Lots of navalgazing about the nature of identity, not that that's a bad thing, the philosophy was often interesting. The conflict felt forced to keep the readers attention, it did work though, it's almost 4am here.
  I think it was a bit strange that there was only one laboratory described flying next to the horizon, lightspeed would have meant others wouldn't have played much of a role but I think they should have been talked about. There were some other inconsistencies and oddities but I guess every story has those.

  I recently watched the movie Palm Springs. It was very good, and somewhat rationalist! Spoilers for why, reveals a plot-point involved in resolution: >!They use the scientific method to escape the time-loop. Not just random mumbo-jumbo. They take a goat & test their theory for how to escape empirically.!<
  ```

  - u/GlueBoy:
    ```
    Ehhh. I loved it as a comedy and I'd second the rec on that basis, but I don't know if I'd call it rational, let alone rationalist. Setting up that kind of expectation might lead to disappointment. 

    The rules for time travel seemed to be inconsistent, for starters. IIRC they >!blow up the goat and the goat disappeared from the next time loop. They took that as proof that it worked and blow themselves up. But in the next loop, JK Simmons meets a version of the non-timelooped version of Nyles. Shouldn't he disappear from the loop like the goat did?(I might be misremembering this one, it's been a while)!<

    Also the characters themselves. They left behind >!JK Simmons with just a voicemail to explain how to leave? What if he never got the voicemail for whatever reason? Why not just do it in the next loop after talking to him since there was absolutely no hurry to leave in that specific loop? Did they leave it to chance that they might consign this guy to an eternity in the loop just so they could leave as soon as possible? !<

    Finally, the solution to the loop. >!The idea that one could make progress in a highly complex field of physics(starting as a complete beginner!) with zero ability to keep your notes and equations from one day to the next is kinda far fetched. But that's a minor quibble, tbf.!<

    That reminds me, if you want a great, rational time travel movie, check out Predestination. It's on netflix in my country(canada).
    ```

    - u/D0TheMath:
      ```
      Your criticisms are fair. I was really just impressed >!they did an empirical test of their solution to the time-loop instead if just deciding “hey, what if we need to do X” & having that work!<, so I say it was rationalist on the basis that the meta-strategy they use to get out would work in an actual time-loop situation, even if the specifics of the situation, mechanics, and solution don’t really make sense.
