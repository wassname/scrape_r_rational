## [D][WIP][BST][RT][HSF][MK] How do you deal with random super powered humans?

### Post:

Alright, I've got my own ideas but here is the rough premise.

There are human equivalent intelligences. They have been given some completely physically possible powers.

This power set includes access to production of explosives at a comparable energy density as a human body can produce (you recall the fun caloric counter that points out four apples have comparable energy to a stick of dynamite? they can turn apples into dynamite metabolically).

They are nominally immune to small projectiles of all kinds (their bodies are built to flex like high precision engineered meta-materials or in a worst case scenario 'fail gracefully' and allow bullets to pass through their bodies entirely, they have a paucity of actual vital organs).

Arbitrarily they appear to have been given a weakness to close range engagements that logically should not have any more effect to them then bullets (bullshit weakness), and anti-vehicle munitions can function by sheer overkill factor of leaving nothing behind by raw energy (no matter how fancy your carbon is molten metal from an RPG is hard to stop).

There are roughly a billion of them. They are not unified or necessarily coordinated or motivated in any singular way, their easily recognized with distinctive physical traits that are not readily able to be disguised (a few million of them can pass for normal human to passive observation but there are ways to find out if you really work hard to screen).

They generally are no less civil then humans on average, their just potentially very dangerous (any one of them can reliably produce arbitrarily timed or tuned bombs equivelant of 100s of grams of C4)

How do you anticipate governments, authorities, civilization in general and various other groups with a vested interest in providing security to others to deal with this scenario?

If you found yourself in the position of these dangerous human equivalent inteligences how would you behave/interact with things?

For those of you in the position of the potential easy bomb creators, Say you could essentially be paid the insurance payout evaluation of any property damage for anything you personally destroy how would this change your behavior? Said funds are verifiable to be available, untraceable and fungible with a market you could order almost anything from (treat it like amazon).

How many people do you anticipate would respond to that incentive and thus how would you expect that to change the behavior of the people that have to protect others?

  Up to this point, it seems easy enough to apply the cultural detail of the 'right to bear arms', in those countries which have it (or some close equivalent), in that such people cannot be treated differently merely because they are unable to /stop/ exercising that right. There would be lawsuits galore, but for once, I suspect that the NRA and ACLU would join forces to defend the bomb-makers in question.

  > you could essentially be paid the insurance payout evaluation of any property damage for anything you personally destroy

  /This/, however, changes the incentives that such people face, and would cause all /sorts/ of fooferaw. The fact that they can create explosives isn't that big a deal - the fact that someone is willing to pay them to destroy valuable landmarks is. From at least a certain perspective, whoever set up that market and makes the payouts has effectively declared war on just about every civilized society; and the governments of those societies have every incentive to treat the marketeers as being 'enemies of all humanity' in much the way that seafaring pirates are. With some luck, then the top brass of the major nations will get together, issue a formal declaration of war, and go about the matter of working out strategies and tactics in a manner consistent with 'just war theory'. Without that luck... round-ups and pogroms will end up giving the bomb-making people every incentive to defend themselves, by blowing things up to get the money to buy the tools they need.

  After the initial freak out, the developed world will just see them as citizens like anyone else. It's not like they can control it, and most humans are able to restrain themselves from punching people, even though they can.

  The power set you have described means there are no superheroes. Offensively they cause too much collateral damage, and defensively they can't take much more dynamite than a normal person. (They might *survive* more dynamite, but getting their legs blown off is still a mission kill.) They'll be good against conventional criminals, but not against each other. And really, most conventional crimes don't end in police shoot-outs, so superheroes won't make that much of a difference even there.

  Every year, there are about 400 reported incidences of violent crime in the US per 100,000 people. That works out to about one supervillain for every two thousand people or so. (With repeat offenders, there could be fewer.) That's without the insurance fraud market. About 1% of people admit to having set fires for fun or property damage, so you could be looking at two or three or more times that number in serial arsonists, with some overlap.

  Those bombers will be much harder to catch than the mundane sort, since they won't leave any evidence that distinguishes them from any other superbeing. But they can be shut down hard just by using more security cameras. In fact, insurance companies might offer to cut your rates back to pre-superbeing levels if you install cameras. Ultimately, I don't think the average person's life would change all that much.

  The developing world is a bit more interesting. Radical groups with superbeing members can rapidly expand their influence, and the more they have, the more control they can have. But I think this is also a self-limiting problem. If ISIS and Al Qaeda go at each other with even more bombs, things will get really bloody, and any civilians are in big trouble. It'll be bad, but it won't end in a supervillain god-king - It will just end in fire.

  Most of what you described will essentially end up with a word and society identical to our own, with the minor different of possible ways to abuse that power to generate energy etc.

  The incentive you mention in the end changes things somewhat, but to be honest not as much as it would seem.
  money is only worth soemthing because society says so, money cannot be untraceable as you mention unless we are dealing with reality warpers. you couldn't just make 100 million dollars, be a mutant and everyone will be like "hmm that huge building exploded a month ago and this dude suddenly has lots of free cash and is a mutant, but its probably nothing right?".
  moreover i don't see any reason that incentive will not cause the same issues with non-mutants.
  I mean the part about bullet resistance and ability to produce explosives is fairly insignificant in the grand scheme of things. if it was actually possible to destroy shit, get money for it and not get hurt in the process with any kind of positive percentage everyone will be doing it. if necessary a guy with not power will simply use a mutant to do it. because much more then the explosive or minor physical resistance what you need to pull off such crime is brains, and they would presumably still be distributed normally 

  so there are 2 options, either you have that reality warper, and the world governments don't actually care, which ends in complete destruction of everything, until the point money isn't actually worth anything.

  Or nothing will happen, except for maybe one in a while a crazy person tries to explode shit, which is essentially pretty much what we have now anyhow.

  If I wanted to engage in insurance fraud I could already do that, so no. This is unlikely to be long-term viable... insurance markets would adjust and the folks behind these payouts would probably be treated as terrorists if they went on for any period of time.

  Rationally, I don't see any incentive for that to happen. Really.

  Can you translate that into bullet-equivalents?

  How efficient is are their powers. If their powers are very efficient, then HEIs could use their abilities to make coal, gasoline, alcohol, etc... cheaper that it is to mine and/or refine naturally. I can see HEIs going to work in power production and industry for their ability to synthesis materials more effectively than current processes can.

  What can't they produce? Does it have to be explosive? Does the energy requirements for producing something come from them or something else?

  This reminds me of alchemy from Full Metal Alchemist.

    The energy comes from the stuff the powered individuals eat with perhaps minor amounts of solar energy collected from being outside. At a spit ball I am not a perfect engineer of metabolisms but this seems viably right now to me I'd suspect they can convert food with an efficiency of about half? if that's really off lets assume it's the equivalent of double-triple the ability of humans to convert food into muscle motion but as chemical energy.

    And yes they can produce some compounds like gasoline and alcohol. Although They probably would have to eat a massive buffet platter each for it to be industrially useful.

      Ya, but it would be a renewable source of gasoline. Kind of like the idea of making bacteria that convert sugar to gasoline, but with HEIs doing it instead.
