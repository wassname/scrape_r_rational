## Looking for something new to binge read(finished Worth the Candle today).

### Post:

Once again, I am done with an amazing piece of literature and feel like this is it, this time I have really exhausted all the great stuff out there. time for the horrible long wait, winter has come. Well, things had always worked out in the end, but recently the search has become quite difficult, I think this time I need help.(seriously,I can't go through the day without at least 5 hours of reading. save me!).

What I am looking for is always the same thing, a protagonist who works hard within an established and well explained magic/combat system to get better at something... and the rational touch. Romance and good character interactions/dialogue are always a great bonus, And strong professional writing is a must( One of the reasons I could never get into those Wuxia novels/japanese LN).

This general personal preference always reflects on the stories I love:

HPMOR

Mother of learning 

The games we play 

Harry potter and the natural 20

The good student

Worth the candle

Savage Divinity( I wouldn't call it a rational fic, but good nonetheless)

Cradle series by will wight 

A virtual dream
 
Dream drive

Not rational, but I also enjoyed- Not this time, fate and Professor Arc by Coeur. Mostly because of the comedy, time loop aspect and the great character interactions.

I have tried and couldn't get into: worm, The Wandering inn, The arcane emperor. 

Anything( webnovels, books, manga, comics) along those lines that already has at least one book worth of content published is welcome.

  I've been enjoying [The Gods Are Bastards](https://tiraas.wordpress.com/2014/08/20/book-1-prologue/) recently. There is quite a lot to it, though, so you won't finish it in one binge. There are a number of main characters, and mostly they work hard (well some more than others) at getting better at stuff.

  Also, [With this ring](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-thread-twelve.25032/) has had quite a lot of good character empowering themselves stuff over the years.
  ```

  - u/CouteauBleu:
    ```
    I'll second With This Ring, with a caveat: I think it's very much the "junk food" of superhero stories. There's no grandiose story-spanning arcs like Worm, or exploration of deep social issues like Strong Female Protagonist or The Metropolitain Man.

    But it's there. It's just that story that consistently has a new post every single day (the author is *really* serious about that), with consistently okay writing, fun moments, mini character arcs, explorations of DC Comics and superhero tropes, etc.
    ```

    - u/OutOfNiceUsernames:
      ```
      Why is it junk food? Among its main themes are deconstruction, [technology uplift](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyUplift) and [schizotech](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchizoTech), and it works on these themes quite well. It also has good fight scenes and rational (if somewhat marysueish) protag.

      It does have a slower-paced, “zoomed-in” narrative that also includes slice-of-life moments, but that’s just what its format is — it’s not trying to gain its competitive ability through the story length alone (which is what I’d call “junk reading” — just feeler chapters, but lots of’em).

      Though admittedly I haven’t checked on this story for some time by now, its quality could’ve deteriorated from what I know.

      It's much better read in bulk than as-it-updates, I found. I've taken to catching up just once every couple of months.

  - u/SaintPeter74:
    ```
    I'll second The Gods are Bastards as my current favorite.  It is epic in scope and length.  I do agree that there a pretty significant number of POV characters.  It's not quite Infinite Jest, though.  I think it holds together better when read straight through. 

    It's harder for me when I come back after a month and try to remember who everyone is, especially once everyone starts to come together (as they are in the current arc).

  Give *[Sufficiently Advanced Magic](https://www.amazon.com/Sufficiently-Advanced-Magic-Arcane-Ascension-ebook/dp/B06XBFD7CB)* a try.  It's a pseudo lit-rpg with a rationalist protagonist.  In some ways it's similar to the Cradle series by Will Wight.

  Not actually trying to convince you, just curious, what made you drop worm?

  Anyway, [Dream Drive](https://www.literotica.com/s/dream-drive-ch-01) seems like it will be your kind of story. Have fun, and don't worry, the website is misleading.

  EDIT: wait shit did you just add dream drive after my post or did I miss it the first time around, if it's the latter oops
  ```

  - u/vakusdrake:
    ```
    I mean I'm not the OP but I suspect like a lot of people including myself they dropped it because it just gets too depressing and grimdark and everything you hear about the story indicates it's only going to get moreso as things progress. Plus the pacing gets a bit too slow in parts as well for some people's taste.

    Also the OP mentioned dream drive as being something they already read and liked in the post.
    ```

    - u/trekie140:
      ```
      You hit the nail on the head for why I dropped it. Seeing Taylor suffer one setback after another when I wanted to see her succeed was emotionally unsatisfying. Breaking Bad at least had protagonists who I rooting against as much as for, so I was okay with seeing them get screwed over again and again while still wanting them to keep trying.
      ```

          ```

  - u/Calsem:
    ```
    I dropped it because Taylor *always* managed to get herself out of the most rediculous situations she shouldn't have survived.  When she somehow managed to escape [](#s "dragon") I quit the story.  A little plot armour is fine but it got to the point of rediculousness.
    ```

    What makes you recommend Dream Drive? (This is the first time I've ever heard of dream drive)
    ```

    - u/Makin-:
      ```
      I saw he tried Arcane Emperor, and Dream Drive is pretty much AE but well written and with a planned plotline. It's the best litRPG I've read, though Worth The Candle has been giving it a run for its money lately so I might have to update that.

      I'd say Dream Drive's biggest strength is characters, in litRPGs non-main characters usually aren't that important, but in DD they feel like real people with real agency. It's appealing in a rational fiction way. Technical writing is flawless too. 

      Shame it's not finished, but again, WtC hits the same spot for me.

      There's porn. To be fair, it's used as a tool, and the story seems to be more plot-with-porn than porn-with-plot. 

      As an example, the main character has a one night stand, which serves to emphasize the shallowness of the Hub.

    Personally I dropped it because the action sequences got longer, and very predictable in structure. (The earlier ones have the same pattern, but it took me a while to notice/care).
    I just stopped caring about how she was going to win by screwing her self over.

    Taylor was kind of dumb too, and her self destructive spiral was taking too long.

  "Worth the Candle" is pretty high on the list of things I've binged recently, but you've already read that, alas.  If you didn't say you were against xianxia I would have recommended "Forty Millenniums of Cultivation" which is pretty much the *Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann 40K and the Methods of Rationality* fic that the margins of HPMOR Ch. 64 were too small to contain, except that it's more "The Methods of Economics and Engineering" that are creeping in around the sides of the xianxia cliches.  "The Erogamer" (requires login, very NSFW) has some of the same actually-thinking-about-the-implications as "Worth the Candle", plus the author is into either stats or ML and sometimes throws in math easter eggs or references.  It happens to be randomly true that I've been rereading "Alchemical Solutions" (the wormfic) which might not be too far off the theme of your list.  In case you weren't already on notice, ShaperV aka E. William Brown, the author of Time Braid, has an original SF book "Perilous Waif".
  ```

  - u/MultipartiteMind:
    ```
    (Minor thoughts.)

    After reading through the first 97 chapters of 'Forty Millenniums of Cultivation', chapter 79's “Amiableness is Amiableness. Happiness is happiness. Blazing flames are flames. But Dreams… aren’t something that can be sold!" was surprising and refreshing, the main character choosing the route of greatest utility and engineering-knowledge-acquisition even in the face of hotbloodedness, friendship, and the dramaticness of slaughter.  Making the choice that was right for him, rather than taking the easier route of smooth interpersonal relationships.

    At the same time, I had an unhappy worry that this would turn out to be lip service, and that the narrative would forcefully push him to the path in conflict with those values he'd chosen (and in favour of friendliness and hotbloodedness), after token resistance.

    As part of in parallel with the feared pushing, the interpersonal side of the chosen path went to extreme lengths to throw its face away as far as possible, making itself as unattractive as possible.

    The true finally-followed path, revealed in chapter 97, did not make me happy.

    I must now (rant about/)paraphrase conversations from a completely different author!

    ---

    "Hey, there's an opportunity for violence and conflict!  Are you going to join in?"

    "No, for I am a noble soul, and would far prefer spending the time with my loved ones here.  I have chosen that I will not be going."

    "Ooh, ooh, here are now some random reasons that you can't avoid going!"

    "Oh well.  VIOLENCE AHOY!"

    [Repeat x2-20]

    ---

    Specific plotthread (Coiling Dragon):

    "Only two more Macguffins and you can reach your special level to become more powerful than anyone ever, something that you've always dreamed of!"

    "Yes!  I long for it so much!"

    "Okay, now you've gotten one, just one more to go!  Then you can finally attain what you've always dreamed of!"

    "No, no...  I would have to choose someone to kill in order to take the last Macguffin I need, so I'm just going to shelve that whole idea."

    "Okay, now there's someone here who viciously hates your guts and is part of a group trying to kill you and your loved ones, and he also has a Macguffin you need!  Are you going to get his Macguffin?"

    "No, no...  no call for violence, it would be so uncouth to raise my hand against him."

    "Hey!  You went up against the final boss with only half-baked incomplete power, and now he's going to kill you--"

    "QUICK QUICK I HAVE TO QUICKLY KILL SOMEONE FOR THEIR MACGUFFIN!"

    _"I am the final boss.  I am responsible for all the worst unnecessary misery and suffering and torment that you have experienced.  If you kill me normally, I will die tormented and regretful, my dearest wish unfulfilled, and you will finally have delivered true punishment, or vengeance, or whatever.  If you instead use your full power to kill me, I will die completely happy and satisfied, thinking 'All those horrible things I did?  Worth it!'.  Will you make me happy?"_

    "Yes.  Yes, fulfilling your dearest wish--which you did horrible things to my loved ones for--and making you happy is a worthwhile thing to do.  In fact, it's so worthwhile I'm even going to kill lots of non-complicit bystanders too with the power of this strike, and not display even a moment of guilt or regret, despite my earlier words about not killing even one murderous enemy for his Macguffin that would bring me to my own desired heights of power."

    _"Joy!"_

    -----

    Edit:  ...Ahh, and more memories...

    "...And then, for personal benefit, I slaughtered an entire family, including the elderly and weak and babies, every single one I could find."

    "Meh, it happens.  Morally neutral thing, in the world we live in."

    "Oh, and though you never had any interactions with them or knew anything about them, it turns out you shared some of their genes."

    I can also recommend E. William Brown's other quasi-LitRPG series starting with [Fimbulwinter (Daniel Black, #1) ](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22500562-fimbulwinter).  It's got a bit of sex and a harem, but is otherwise an engrossing bit of fun.
    ```

    - u/TwoxMachina:
      ```
      On a related note, I recommend E. William Brown's Alice Long series, with Perilous Waif (1 only so far).

      Quite fun, and different from his other series, no sex.
      ```

      - u/celeritatis:
        ```
        It's not what I would call "strong professional writing", but nothing OP listed that I've read meets my standards for that, so it may be worth ignoring me.

        Fimbulwinter and sequels are particularly great for the "Protag builds things, works with others, doesn't completely ignore potential allies, etc" feeling that is missing from so much. It's particularly bad if you mind stunningly blatant self-inserts that the author doesn't seem to realize aren't subtle at all.

  One story I have enjoyed a lot lately, though I wouldn't call it rational per se, is [Everybody Loves Large Chests](http://royalroadl.com/fiction/8894/everybody-loves-large-chests).

  The story features a very consistent system, and a main character that starts very weak (physically and mentally) and gets progressively smarter and stronger in a believable way. It is also rather funny.

  As should be apparent from the link, the story has quite a lot of NSFW content. In fact, there are a couple of interludes early on that can be pretty much skipped if one isn't interested in smut but, after reader complaints, the author reduced the amount of sex significantly.
  ```

  - u/josephwdye:

  Liked HPMOR? Try Significant Digits. It builds into the characters set by EY and expands a lot into the world, when the rational Hogwarts trio are young adults.

  I consider it a canonical continuation, as it doesn't change Yudkowsky's version, is extremely good and rounds up some loose threads of the original HPMOR quite nicely
  ```

- u/CouteauBleu:
  ```
  [The Moon's Apprentice](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/196256/the-moons-apprentice). It's very HP:MoR-ish, and centered about the protagonist trying to become a God, so I think it fits your itch pretty well. The writing goes from meh to pretty good, and is overall pretty strong.

  On the other hand, it's pretty dark and depressing; the protagonist is bitter and self-destructive in some ways, and her quest isn't exactly motivated by healthy reasons. Still worth a try.

  [Prequel Adventure](http://www.prequeladventure.com/) The story can be extremely depressing, not in the "Holy shit this character I liked just died" way, but in a way that hits very close to home. Like, "Holy shit, this girl is a loser, I am really not comfortable with how much like her I am". The characters builds herself up, in the sense that she starts at the bottom of the barrel, with nowhere to go but up.

  The moments where Katia does get her wins feel like some of the most moments I've felt from any work of fiction. This is a story that tells you something about yourself, and in a twisted way, gives you hope for the future.

      It's worth saying that reading Pact can be *very* frustrating. The protagonist makes intelligent, rational choices (maybe not the best choices, but reasoned and rational nonetheless) and everything just seems to get worse for him. Ad infinitum.

      It's frankly depressing. Fitting, perhaps, considering the universe it's set in, but reading "*And then it got worse*" every single chapter gets tiring and boring quick. Or at least it did for me, I know many people liked it, though it didn't have nearly the same acclaim Worm had.

  How come no one mentioned [The Arithmancer](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10070079/1/The-Arithmancer) ?

    The protagonist becomes a mary sue in the sequel, about the time the entire casts get a lobotomy at the start of the war.

    I'm not sure that the magic system is really all that well established...though I did enjoy the story.
    ```

    - u/ZeCatox:
      ```
      Oh ? I find those systems pretty well thougth and explored. The mathematical aspect behind the creation of spells, the runes, the stones lay lines, the rituals... the way Hermione has to hack those down and invent from seems to me to be a core of the story.

      - u/thrawnca:
        ```
        > The mathematical aspect

        Yes and no. The mathematical concepts in the story may be real enough, but the application of them feels a bit like Captain Picard giving orders to "adjust shields to compensate for the instability."

        It's definitely a step - several steps - up from canon, and book 1 felt reasonably well balanced. The sequel is where I really get a Hermy Sue vibe.

  I've read (and enjoyed) almost everything you listed.

  If you like "The Good Student", you may also enjoy Mooderino's other two stories:  
  [How to Avoid Death on a Daily Basis](http://gravitytales.com/novel/how-to-avoid-death-on-a-daily-basis) - It's an atypical portal fantasy.  The main character is a selfish asshole, but in a good way.  Can't say if it's especially rational, but it is a heck of a lot of fun.

  [Bitter](https://royalroadl.com/fiction/10293/bitter) - An atypical LitRPG story with a (refreshingly) female non-gamer as a main character.  Lots of fun as he explores the idea that it's a game . . . some of the the worst excesses of game companies.  Certainly rational-adjacent.

    ```
    Female and he? Honest mistake, or gender-fluid protagonist?
    ```

    - u/SaintPeter74:
      ```
      In this case I meant He = Mooderino, the author.  More a meta level commentary on the themes of the story, not what the MC does/is.

      As far as I know the MC is cis female, but there are no relationships, as such, in the story so far.

  I would highly reccomend [crystal society.](http://crystal.raelifin.com/society/ChapterOne).  It's a very interesting take on AI that I've never seen before.
