  That's an awesome post. There is a problem though.

  Can anybody think of a genuinely cool and magicky-feeling magical system where energy is used efficiently like this? I'm not convinced it's possible to design one, and I think Rule of Cool necessarily must be applied in order to have a satisfying magic system that would be recognized by the reader as a magic system that does *magic*. It seems impossible to not run up against this issue and have to handwave it for flavour reasons.

    Yeah, if what you want is classical D&D magic, you can't really do the orders of magnitude stuff without adding in a whole bunch of rules that make things inelegant (and the more you have to explain your rules, the worse your story generally is for it).

    You *can* make magic systems that respect certain levels of power - for example, a magic system that mostly involves information or mental magic would be pretty uniformly low energy - but I'm not sure how much of a benefit there is to that.

    Mostly I think that it's fine to just accept that magic is thumbing its nose at conventional physics, so long as the rules are internally consistent.

    Seen [Ra?](http://qntm.org/ra)

      Perhaps a poor example, since the very first spell we see is a heating spell potent enough to melt a "cheap plastic jacket".

      Now, that was not an ideal tactical decision; it's established later that it was one of the few offensive spells Laura could cast. Most wizarding combat in *Ra* seems to be done with forcefields, which expend very little energy.

    One idea - allow magic to manipulate any random variable, that is observable by the mage, and haven't been resolved yet.

    The cost in MANA is the integral of the difference between the original and changed random distribution of that variable over the whole domain of the random variable.

    Power of the magician is the maximum mana hen can handle in one spell.

    Additional difficulty - you don't know what is the original probability distribution, so you can overload yourself if you miscalculate. The best wizards are the best predictors.

    And you can estimate probabilities of events by trying to change them and overload on purpose. That's how clairvoyance works, and it makes the wizards doing this mad after a while from all that strain.

    Now just to figure out where to get that mana from, so that you can't make infinite feedback loop creating infinite free mana.

    The Kingkiller Chronicles - the art of Sympathy, which is essentially an entire magic system devoted to doing energy transformations. At one point, the main character tries to conjure a breeze by binding the motion of the air to the motion of his lungs.

    It goes about as well as you'd expect. However, there are some other nifty tricks that work better - plates of metal that simply move thermal energy from one end to the other, lanterns powered by the ambient heat of your hand, etc.

    Eragon? AFAICT that magic system is "You can manipulate matter, but the energy cost for that comes directly from your own body's metabolism". Lifting a pebble magically takes the same amount of energy as lifting it mundanely, and that's if you're an experienced magician - it usually takes much *more* energy.

    The characters definitely *cared* about energetic efficiency and Eragon almost died from the energy cost of making a fireball when he was first starting. The best way to kill a person is to drain all their life energy, and the *second* best way is to magically damage the carotid artery. The only time you'd kill a person in any other way is when you were fighting another magician who had shields and countermeasures, and even then I don't think anyone was casually throwing large Area of Effect spells around. As far as I know there is no matter creation - the closest thing to it is shaping the direction of growth of living things.

    (But it only applied to humans. "Wild" magic which could still break the conservation rules. Dragons can breath fire without paying the full energy cost, for example.)

    I didn't read past the first book, so this may be violated later, but from what I recall magic usage was very sensible and conservative.
    ```

  Neat post. It does however assume fine-grained control of magic. If a wizard can cast a fireball only because they know Firaga, it doesn't really apply.
  ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    It's my natural tendency to view magic as a user making function calls instead of a programmer writing code. So it makes total sense that you would have `Fireball()`, `LightningBolt()`, and `Rabbit.Create()` but not be able to specify all that much beyond that, even if they have totally different energy requirements.

  Reminds me of comparing animals with manmade devices.  If you've got a robot or a quadcopter it might run for a few minutes on a battery charge.  A bird can fly for _hours_.  Heck, migratory hummingbirds fly for _days_.

  Wow, the food energy of a Snickers bar is the same as a 2-tonne vehicle. Why can't I push a car up to 72 miles per hour?!?
  ```

    ```
    Because there are mechanical limits to how fast you can run. You could use a machine to bypass those limits. For example, turn a crank to lift heavy weights. Then release the weights, connected to something like an [aircraft catapult](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_catapult).

    You could also feed animals and get them to pull heavy machinery, to plow fields or whatever tractors do. People might have even converted biological energy like that in the past.

    (On a vaguely related note I am still amazed that there are cars/planes/etc. that aren't fly-by-wire. Mechanical linkages seem so strange.)

      1. In Wil McCarthy's *Queendom of Sol* series a man "bicycles" to lunar orbit by spending years using his muscle power to drive a machine that creates sticks of propellant from ambient raw materials.

      2. The failure modes of mechanical linkages are well understood, and can be reliably engineered. Software, not so much.

      Also, human muscles produce a lot of waste heat. They're only about 20% efficient, depending on how you measure that.
      ```

        Ha, I'll just eat five Snickers bars then.
        ```

        ```
        Isn't that also about the efficiency of a car?
        ```

    - u/recursiveAI:
      ```
      We wouldn't even need an aircraft catapult. Just a human-powered hydraulic elevator to lift the vehicle to the required height at the end of a ramp. The vehicle slides down the ramp in neutral gear picking up speed...

  A lot of this is about the time it takes to release that energy.

  For example the energy of fuel in 9 Airbuses A380 is higher than the energy of the atomic bomb that was thrown on Hiroshima.

  But it takes a long time to release the energy in airbuses fuel, so it's not devastating. If you made fuel-air bomb with that much fuel I bet the effects would be similary spectacular, maybe more (because not much energy would be lost on radioactivity instead of heat and shock wave).

  Actually now I'd like to know what would be the effect of such fuel-air bomb.

  BTW it's also the energy of annihilation of 1 gram of matter :/
  ```

  - u/philip1201:
    ```
    Fun fact: that fuel-air bomb would have to be at least 28 million cubic meters in size - a cube with vertices a little over 300 meters long. (times 3 and 1.44 respectively for air with density at cruising altitudes).
    ```
