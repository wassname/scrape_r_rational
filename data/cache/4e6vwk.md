## This is a naruto SI where the SI had no chakra. He does however have extensive engineering knowledge. My engineering knowledge is not that extensive so I will be doing a lot of looking up and will appreciate any help you guys can give me. This is a quest so I will appreciate an help.

  Without chakra, your SI is *dead*. If he actually gets anywhere, it's trivial to assassinate him via gank. Enemy villages will act proactively to take out threats if they need to.

    Without chakra, though, the SI will never actually possess enough personal power to be a threat on there own.

    Yes, if any of the ninja villages felt like it, they could kill the insert with a literal flick of a finger. But why would they want waste something as valuable as a skilled engineer, when they could steal the insert instead? The same lack of personal power that makes them easy to kill makes them easy (though admittedly not to the same degree) to hold captive, and while the OP has clarified in-thread that the insert's chakra-less nature makes them basically immune genjutsu, there are still plenty of other ways of getting the insert to be productive.

      Because said engineer may somehow threat status quo, which is rather beneficial for shinobi. Also even though Orochimaru was a kind of "genius engineer", villages weren't killing each other for his services.

    /u/eaglejarl could probably link you to one of the many rants he's done on the subject of Naruto's tech level.

      The very basics of it is probably: 

      Technology is a lot more interrelated than people think. Kishimoto wants radios and TVs but no guns, etc, even though it's pretty hard to have a scientific community that has figured out CRTs, EM radiation, and AC power but not gunpowder. This is in the same sense that it's hard to have a scientific community that has figured out microelectronics without understanding electricity. A lot of science, particularly chemistry, materials science, physics, and engineering, is really interrelated and builds on itself. 

      Naruto has cell phones, computers, TVs, and, hilariously, satellites. Gunpowder (and combustion engines, and transistors...) clearly must exist, if not because of the microelectronics, at least because of the satellites that were launched into orbit using technology which PROBABLY involved complex understanding of chemistry, combustion, aerodynamics, materials science... But, gunpowder doesn't exist in the anime somehow. This is just handwaved away by Kishimoto. 

      This is fine if your goal is to create some anime that's just about fighting and ninja techniques and not worry about that stuff. It's not the point of the anime. But if you explicitly decide to write a Naruto fanfic with coherent technological worldbuilding, you need to address this somehow. An AU with lower tech levels is one way to do it, and pretty simple. I would just go with that and not worry about it.

        Why would ninja ever use gunpowder when they can throw kunai faster than bullets? When they could probably get shot by bullets or hit by explosions (ninja survive fireballs, massive blunt force impact, getting hit into and through trees and walls, etc.) And survive.

        Nuclear weapons, true, are a game changer and lethal for all ninja but some s-rank, but modern day bombs and bullets don't seem too valuable.
        ```

        - u/Kishoto:
          ```
          Ninja can't throw kunai faster than bullets. Most ninja anyway (I'm specifically thinking about the Raikage here, since he claims his speed is practically on par with lightning). The force required to throw a kunai like that would easily dislocate/break/tear off your arm. (The average bullet travels about 1700mph)

          Modern day bullets are a game changer for the same reason real guns were. They allowed armies to form up much easier and much more reliably. It took someone of skill and proper build years to learn how to properly utilize a sword and a shield. It would take much less time for someone to get passably good with a gun. Which would give them range, meaning they had an advantage over non-gun wielding armies. The samurai don't utilize chakra in and of themselves, but are a potent neutral force in the Naruto world, showing that it's possible to stand back against the chakra wielders with proper innovation and preparation. Hence guns. 

          Modern day bombs, I can agree that most ninja seem fast enough to make them trivial. They'd detect the trap, or hear the trigger for it, or a thousand and one other things. They'd see the grenade and *move*. So, in battle, bombs probably aren't all that useful. 

          Gunpowder is also necessary for things like designing rockets and whatnot. It's a building block towards more advanced forms of combustion (?) technology. 

          But to be completely honest, this is all the most conjecture and bullshit. Since we see ninjas (properly powerful ones) survive things that should mean a knife is meaningless against them but oh well **ANIME MAGIC AHOY!**

          TL;DR: Naruto =/= logically consistent. [Problem?](https://openclipart.org/image/2400px/svg_to_png/130795/Trollface.png)

    Given you're looking at large building level dc Genin with two digit mach at the end of part one (discounting Summons who can hit town level DC) up to moon busting levels at the end of part two / post time skip, you have to nerf the piss out of the Naruto world unless the engineer is making magitech using "Chakra" as a power source.
