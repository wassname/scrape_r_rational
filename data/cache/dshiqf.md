## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding and Writing Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*
* Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is *also* the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  TL/DR:

  Hi! I’m doing some worldbuilding for a fantasy setting with flying islands.  Thoughts on physical, social and economic considerations are welcome.  Some specific questions below, followed by more detail.

  Questions/Prompts:

  What social changes might one expect in a society of Dragon Riders as they go from warlike Iron Age Mongols to a settled, affluent civilization?  Luxury miniature pet dragon breeds? Racing/jousting culture?

  What are some key steampunky techs crafty dwarves would create when living on flying islands? (airships, duh, but what other not obvious but extremely useful contraptions might become pervasive?  Lots of windmills, probably, depending on climate? Zip lines/belays?  Mining scaffolds along the outer edges of the islands?  How far can you dig before you break chunks off?)

  What clever industrialization stuff could you do with magical crystals that float on their own power, produce a palpable, deep vibration through the ground and air over long distances, and naturally create fresh water and lush plant growth in land around them?  Limitations - magical radiation in the immediate vicinity causes cancer and birth defects with prolonged exposure.  You can’t tell the crystals what to do/grow, it just happens gradually in their vicinity.  Lift/buoyancy and carry capacity of crystals varies based on size. Big crystals that hold up the islands are essentially fixed in space or drift of their own accord, but shards can be found that are small enough to move around/manipulate and will provide some lift as they tend to drift back to a “resting” default altitude.

  OVERVIEW

  I am doing some worldbuilding for a boardgame I am working on.  It’s a fairly tropey fantasy setting: magic flying islands inhabited by classic fantasy races with a few twists.

  I have written a few chapters of backstory for the various factions, and would love to run ideas by the /r/rational community, as the critical thinking here is the strongest of the various fiction communities I frequent.

  For now, I’d like to focus on fleshing out the rules and politics of the world. I have some basic relationships worked out, but I’d like to dig into the likely cultural and socio-economic consequences of the events I’ve laid out so far.  I would appreciate probing questions, suggestions, poking holes, and filling in gaps in the narrative.

  WORLD BACKGROUND

  I will focus this post on a slice of the world and timeline so as not wander to widely, but here’s a brief history as a starting point:  (\~1000 words)

  Imagine an archipelago of floating islands, held aloft by magic crystals that thrum with barely contained energy.  The bass hum of their vibration can be felt in your chest and through the soles of your feet with every step anywhere you go.

  The islands were once the seat of an ancient cult that guarded the secrets of the crystals and the massive Obelisk at the center of the sky - but those temples are long since abandoned.

  The crystals provide the islands with life - lush forests grow, freshwater springs burst from the rocks.  (conservation of energy/matter becomes a problem here to be dealt with - perhaps the water is only gathered from the air vapor and oceans below, to which it eventually drains/evaporates.)

  The forests are inhabited by the Kipii, a tribe of sentient furry mammals, akin to large flying squirrels or sugar gliders.  They live semi-peacefully for some thousands of years in a stone-age state.

  Then the Azkhal arrive.  Picture something like the Mongol Empire, but with Dragon mounts. They have conquered and plundered the lands below for a few hundred years, until a religious leader sparked a mass migration to the sky islands as part of a holy war/pilgrimage.  They believe in a doctrine of Manifest Destiny, their divine right to subdue and rule the world, and see these islands as a holy place they were meant to inhabit, since only they can reach it.

  Along with them come the Gragir - a slave class of fairly by-the-book dwarves.  They are crafty and industrious, and work as thralls doing metalwork and harvesting raw materials.  Originally inhabitants of the mountain caves where Dragons roosted, picking at the edges of their dens which tended to lie on viens of rare metals, they were taken as thralls by Azkhal forces in search of new mounts to tame and dragon eggs to pilfer.

  The arrival of the Azkhal goes like most colonial events with a power imbalance.  They quickly subdue and drive the Kipii out, who have nothing that can stand up to them. A few attempts at a concentrated defense are made, with various tribes coming together to form massive warbands, but the air superiority of Dragonfire and high quality Gragir-Forged weapons and armor of the Azkhal lay waste to these armies.  The Kipii are forced to fight a slow retreat year after year, harassing where they can but abandoning island after island to the Azkhal advance.

  While brutal, this advance is slow at first.  The Azkhal are limited in their ability to colonize new islands by the logistics of transporting armies and supplies via dragon.  While they’ve amassed a sizeable force of dragons at this point, only so many people and resources can be moved at a time.  The islands are large - together they make up the mass of a continent, and for now the Azkhal hold only a small corner of the sky.

  On the islands they do claim, the Azkhal flourish with the glut of fresh resources and rich land provided by the crystals.  They begin for the first time to put down roots and form a more stable civilization in what they see as their Promised Land.   Over a number of generations, as the wars with the Kipii become less frequent, their culture shifts from warlike raiders to one of luxury, fashion and refinement.  Status becomes less about military prowess and more about affluence and political standing.

  While there was always a significant division in Azkhal society between Bonded Dragon Riders (Hero warrior class), normal warriors, and the servant class, these start to formalize into true Castes.  The Noble Class of dragon-bonded Azkhal rule along-side the Priesthood and heads of the Military, while lesser castes are restricted to either enlisted military service or outright serfdom.  The Gragir take a position as skilled craftsmen and merchants, but racially segregated and derided even by the lower castes of human Azkhal (akin to the medieval Jewish population, though even closer to slavery and even more ghetoized).

  This is the world in which our narrative starts.  A wealthy and stratifying Azkhal culture with a long history of warlike conquest and religious zealotry,  their Gragir craftsmen thralls, and the tribal Kipii, slowly giving up ground to the gradual advance.

  In more recent history, a technological revolution is underway.  The Gragir’s crafts have benefited from the increased luxury and stable society, and they have begun to industrialize.  Shards of the crystals are harnessed to provide energy for factories, and mass production of goods is beginning, creating an economic boom.  At the same time, the invention of the dirigible revolutionizes air travel.  Suddenly, goods can be moved without the rate-limit of available Dragons.

  An explosion of new colonization begins.  The Kipii are once again sent scrambling before the fiery advance.  Islands are taken and outposts set up as fast as the Gragir dirigibles can ferry in new troops and materials, and fresh luxuries are shipped back to the budding Empire.  A vast trade network of airships begins to form, and the economy booms.  The Azkhal Nobles are awash in luxury and opulence.

  At some point, though, the Gragir start noticing just how much things have changed - and how reliant the new Azkhal society is on them. Another sort of revolution is brewing, whispered of in warehouses and on factory floors...

  \*\*\*

  We’ll break there for questions and discussion - I have a few chapters of fiction starting from that point that I’ll post for review at a later date, but I’d like to take this opportunity to talk through the background.

  Feel free to respond to the Questions/Prompts from the TL/DR or other discussion around any aspect of the world is welcome.

    This was a fun read and I like the world as you describe it. Thank you for posting :) I don't know why but I really love the idea of the Kipii.

    For the dwarf tech I am thinking something like a parachute (both personal and for downwards travelling cargo) or maybe a squirrel suit inspired by the Kipii. I think they would be able to develop hand gliders as the Gragir would be able to look at dragon wings for inspiration and from what you describe I believe they should have the material science necessary to make at least short range gliders.

    Depending on how common the magic crystals are I am not sure they would have been quite so desperate for the air ships for infrastructure. By hanging a container below a crystal you have something very close to an air ship. Put the water generate by the crystal into the container to increase the Crystalships weight for descend. Once you get to the ground release the water and stock up on light goods to ascend. Edit: Just realised you need use long rope from ground to island to stop Crystalships being blown away. Not sure how this impacts feasibility.

      Hi, thanks!  I really appreciate the feedback. =)  I like the Kipii too, they were actually the genesis of much of the setting - my wife requested a cute animal faction, sugar gliders got into the mix, and then the whole game took to the sky just to suit them. =)

      Good thought on parachutes both for transport and delivery systems for cargo.  Amazon prime with para-dropped supply crates?  =D   Short-range gliders would also probably be useful in certain situations.  Your comment made me look into the history of gliders, as I had no concept of how recently they had been invented.  According to wikipedia, the Chinese had big kites that could carry a person as early as the 6th century ad!  Though it looks like it took until the 1800s and better understanding of aerodynamics in general before fully functional gliders were in operation.

      For some reason the image of a stocky Dwarf engineer in a glider seems really funny to me. XD  I could actually see these becomming a major passtime or sport among Azkhal nobels, though.  Sure, they have dragons, but the novelty of Kite-Racing seems like the exact sort of thing rich courtiers would fawn over.   I definitely think I could include some of this for flavor.

      Per Crystal abundance: while the massive crystals that hold up the land are embedded inside every island, functional shards are pretty rare and expensive.   Only in the last generation or so have they begun to actively try to mine or harvest larger shards to use as power sources for their factories.   There's some trickiness with getting a hold of and handling shards, as if you lose track of them they might just float away into the sky never to be seen.  Additionally, they are radioactive when not shielded by many meters of stone and dirt.  Safe mining of crystals is a fairly recent innovation, and acquiring one big enough to lift a large amount of cargo would be possible only for the superrich among the Lords.

      Most major cities now have at least one large crystal (lets say an octahedron 5-6 meters tall) that is secured in their factory district and used to generate power.   Smaller shards (from a few centimeters to a half meter) can probably be acquired by an enterprising and wealthy trader as novelties or for private use.

      I think it's likely airships are exactly as you describe - aerodynamic structures outfitted with closed containers of crystal shards or dust to provide some stable level of lift. The main innovations that made them viable recently are safe mining of these materials, a better understanding of aerodynamic design, and the creation of powered turbines and propellers.   Propellers shift what were formerly just clever floating platforms to navigable and speedy ships.  Perhaps there were even some earlier models that functioned off kites/sails, but were beholden to trade winds.  Cool idea!

      Your idea to use the water as ballast is smart, I'll definitely be working that in.

      Thanks for the input this is really getting me thinking =)

    If you can't control what grows on the islands, I think their peace time use would be as pastures for raising animals that can eat whatever the crystals can grow. Depending on how large you're envisioning these islands, there wouldn't be any natural predators, there's no need to keep the animals contained, and it would be really difficult to steal the animals. Disease would also be minimized because the contact with other herds would be small. Then the ranchers could drop down whatever they want to sell with parachutes, and use dragons or whatever to shuttle people and needed equipment up and down the island.

    If the crystals grow vegetation year round, you don't even really care about seasons for raising livestock, which would cause a lot of knock-on effects like societies around the islands having reliable food for the winter.

    Wood would be a major export as well, if trees grow at absurd rates.

    Smaller islands would be invaluable as castles, due to the difficulty in attacking them from below, and the ease of dropping rocks on anyone on the ground. Plus, going under a castle's walls couldn't happen without it being super obvious.  Watchtowers built on islands would be tremendously useful as well.

    If dirgibles can replace dragons for moving things around, dragons would probably go the way of the horse after the invention of cars. Dragons of any significant size would eat a lot, and dragons are typically carnivores, so would be really expensive to keep around if they aren't economically useful. Rich people might keep them around for things like racing, being guards, the medieval equivalent of a private jet, etc. but they would be on the decline. I don't think you would have significant diversity in dragon sizes due to artificial selection, because it would take a long time to yield results, and would be expensive in the mean time. You could maybe breed lessened aggression into them though, but this would depend on the time scales of dragons maturing.  In the early era, acquiring islands and thus good land for raising livestock would significantly boost the ability to feed dragons for military use.

    Windmills on the islands makes a lot of sense, because there's more wind at higher altitudes. You could also have water mills fed by the water falling from the islands. The huge amounts of animal dung would provide an enormous amount of fertilizer, which means you could grow a lot of wheat, to then grind into flour with the wind and water mills.

      Thanks for the reply, these are some good observations! 

      I agree, focusing heavily on pasture animal cultivation is probably the way to go.  This makes even more sense for a culture of Dragon riders as they will have need of copious amounts of meat (though in my imagining so far, these dragons also eat some stone, a la the old flight of the dragons film) 

      as you say, the relatively safe pastures with bountiful greenery would be an excellent environment, so long as you can keep your cows/sheep from wandering off the edges ;) 

      Your comments prompted some more thinking about the relationship to the people on the ground, as well. 

      One important detail regarding interactions with the lands below: I'm picturing the archipelago as existing quite high up, and driving around relative to the land underneath.   Those living on the ground catch glimpses of the sky islands in the clouds, and have many superstitious beliefs and legends about them, but reaching them is an impossibility dismissed by most.  

      Because they move around and are so distant, commerce and communication with the ground is costly and difficult.  

      This raises a niggling issue I've been putting off for a while - how the Azkhal initially migrated to the islands en mass in the first place.   If their transfer bandwidth is limited by available dragons, and that first move is even bigger/longer than the trips between neighboring islands, then they should have an easier time getting between islands than the initial migration.

      Thus, I think I need some sort of triggering event, like a once every few hundred years alignment of the islands with some other mountain range or natural plateau, that made that first jump easier.   Maybe for some months or even longer it was fairly close to an existing Azkhal stronghold or band, and there were a series of trips made, until the entire continent drifted out of range and became more isolated again. 

      My thought is that now a dragon could make the trip *down* but would have a hard time getting back.  it would be possible for very strong fliers if the islands drifted close enough, but finding and catching them is a challenge. 

       This leads to an isolated microcosm for some period of time where the Azkhal needs to learn to settle down and become more self-sufficient, rather than relying on conquest and plunder. 

      To that point, and your comments around roles of Dragons in an airship-capable society: 
      I agree they would be replaced as the primary mode of transport except for the elite.  However, they do remain as major status symbols for nobles, and as such wouldn't disappear as quickly as horses.  They are fairly long-lived, and some older dragons would hang around their bonded noble families for a few generations as a sort of heir loom and mark of honor.  

      Private jets is also right on - I imagine going for romantic and thrilling dragon rides will remain plenty in vogue.   

      I like the idea of breeding lessened aggression - there's the case of the arctic foxes domesticated in just a few generations by some russian researchers (I think?) that started taking on dog-like traits.  I think you could see some breeds emerge that would be fashionable or a mark of high status and wealth. "Check me out, I don't NEED a dragon that's a strong fighter, mine is lithe and docile, I just keep him around at great expense to show my wealth." 

      Also with you re:windmills.  Seems like both these and watermills taking advantage of waterfalls at the edges of islands would be in common use. This is probably one of the major stepping stones toward the recent industrial revolution.  If they've been there, say, nine generations, mills would see heavy use in gen 3-5, become more refined, then maybe gen 6-7 we start seeing them become more advanced and getting to real factories and steam power. 

      Thanks for all the insights!  This is really helpful.

    Assuming the kipii have night vision similar to that of sugar gliders, they could serve as messengers for a dwarven rebellion. Able to travel between islands under cover of night, they could smuggle intelligence, weapons, and possibly even dwarves throughout the empire, enabling the kind of coordination necessary to disrupt the entire society. They have ample reason to work together and their abilities complement each other, so this partnership has a shot of actually working.

      Also, needs to be said- the image of a sugar glider in a trenchcoat and hat standing on a rainy streetcorner to sell secrets and supplies to a dwarf is hilarious.

  Whenever I read about the alignments in DnD, with Good vs Evil and Chaotic vs Order, and the spell, Detect Alignment, I think about how that spell can be abused and what it does to the world to have an actually objective measure of 'good' (results vary based on how well it conforms to human expectations).

  However, it's often a little too simple for my tastes to simply have binary measures for detecting good and evil, since no one is purely one or the other. But just the other day, I ran across an interesting version in [World of Prime](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B074CH5VCC/?ie=UTF8&%2AVersion%2A=1&%2Aentries%2A=0).

  There is a cheap, widespread spell to cast on a person which returns one of six colors, and these colors correspond to [Kohlberg's stages of moral development](https://en.wikipeia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Kohlberg's_stages_of_moral_development):

  * Black - Complete amoral sociopathy.
  * Red - Mainly motivated by fear of punishment.
  * Yellow - Very selfish and focused on what they can gain.
  * Green - Very motivated by peer approval and looking good/honorable.
  * Blue - Mainly following a social contract or the law.
  * White - People who have the character to be concerned with universal rights for everyone.

  The story had a poem about the spell about what motivates people for each of the colors.:

  >*White for right,*  
  >  
  >*Blue for tame,*  
  >  
  >*Green for name,*  
  >  
  >*Yellow for gain,*  
  >  
  >*Red for pain,*  
  >  
  >*Black for none.*

  I'm curious how people think the world would be impacted if there was a cheap, common device to do something similar.

  Another interesting fact from the story is that the goblins have a long racial history of killing off any hatchlings with any potential for beyond Black, while the elves have been selecting for only those of the white to reproduce, and over the generations, resulted (in the typical fantasy conceits) of all-evil and all-good races. Does anyone think that something similar would be possible if the hypothetical machine above were to exist?

    Guaranteed that people will be getting tested as a pre-employment evaluation. It's going to be ugly:

    * White: Unreliable, might break the rules if the rules are creating an unfair situation (which they almost always will). Might escalate problems by trying to form a union, making complaints with OSHA or the Department of Labor, or going to the news. Avoid hiring.

    * Blue: Ideal for hiring. Make sure the rules are clearly laid out for them and they can do anything.

    * Green: Okay for hiring, but keep them in positions where they can't make secret deals, fudge statistics, or bully their coworkers to handle some of their work to make themselves look better. Best usage is to put them alone in a room with supplies and have them make things (which undergo quality control testing later) so you can be sure that their success or failure will be entirely on their own shoulders.

    * Yellow: Reasonable choice as a CEO or senior manager, but needs careful supervision. They will do things that make people hate them if it brings in a lot of money, as long as they get a share of it. Just be wary that they don't harm the company for their own interests. Can also do well as a salesperson or marketer if they're getting a commission.

    * Red: Risky in most positions. Can't be assigned important tasks. Best fit is in supervised manual labor.

    * Black: Risky to have anything to do with these guys. Avoid hiring and make sure your security knows what they look like.

    Now you have a society where black and white are all unemployed. Interesting times lie ahead.

    It seems like some/most societies would quickly develop stratification of law, i.e. having different standards of evidence, punishments, etc. for the same crime. If you know that someone will primarily/only respond to punishment, then you're best off ensuring that their version of the justice system will punish them, ideally with better enforcement schemes that will actually catch them. Similarly, profiling by what the spell says (and coding/cataloging everyone for easy reference) makes a lot of sense.

    It's not clear to me whether the White would accept such a scheme though, as it seems like a clear violation of what we'd call 'universal rights'.

    Whether you'd actually be able to breed a certain color depends on whether or not it's genetic, which ... I guess is the author's call, but probably isn't what I would do unless I was making a very specific sort of commentary/analysis.

  I just thought I would put an idea that I had for quite while now to paper.

  Basicly how a high fantasy world with different sentient races could come to be without creationism. And would explain the possibility of half-anythings. 

  Basically world is populated by humans. Big ice age happens, civilization are separated by huge glaciers. 
  This would would need big mountain ranges in the world to work. 
  Different populations develop in different environments. Orcs maybe in a dessert, elves in a wooded Valley, humans anywhere. Dwarves maybe near a geologically active volcano?
   Dwarven and elven longevity as adaptions to scarce resources? 
  What do you think about this idea, are there any stories like that out there?

  If you throw lightly mutating magic in it could be believable in relatively small timeframes.

    good idea to explore! 

    I know warhammer has dwarves that evolved due to living on higher gravity planets.  I think there have been other attempts to justify the existence of fantasy races through natural means. 

    here's a stack exchange discussion about a similar topic: 

    [https://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/questions/12190/what-common-ancestor-would-the-basic-fantasy-races-evolve-from](https://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/questions/12190/what-common-ancestor-would-the-basic-fantasy-races-evolve-from)

    I definitely think it could be made to seem plausible!

  multiworlds immortality theory

  when an event happens, we have two possible outcomes. you survived, or you died. because you are still alive, you are the result of every 'survived' combined to reach this point. some you never noticed, others you can remember as a close call. some choose between suicide, or continuing on. 

  you are immortal. specifically, the version of you that continues to live. but eventually, technology improves. it improves enough to keep increasing your chance for survival just enough. or they freeze you to restore at some point in the future, if no possible future would otherwise allow for your survival. 

  now, the universe YOU survive in is not the same universe as someone else survives in. but you are schrodingers immortal, staying alive despite the growing number of universes where you are actually dead. because for the you that can observe, you observe that you woke up in the morning, and then survived another day. no nuclear war, that was in the other timeline. you are just lucky enough to always be the version that survived.
