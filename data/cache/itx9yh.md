## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding and Writing Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*
* Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is *also* the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday Recommendation thead)

  I’ve been a Star Wars fanfic search lately and it got me thinking about the dark side of magic systems: when the magic or force or whatever you call it has aspects that are powerful but innately evil or biased towards evil and are corruptive in some way.  By dark side I mean in general stuff like Gold Magic in Worth the Candle, or breaking the laws of magic in the Dresden Files, or Diabolism in Pact, or the magic in Warhammer Fantasy.

  How potent does a “Dark Side” need to be to get run away feedback loops?  I.e. you can’t even intentionally use it safely once because it has the potential to be so useful/addictive/corrupting/seductive.

  Conversely, how weak can a “dark side” be and you still get the same type of cultural warnings that you do in Star Wars, I.e. wise mentor characters are scared to use it even once accidentally (regardless of if this is actually true)?

  Any unusual takes on the Dark Side?

    One angle that sort of makes sense for the Star Wars dark side is that force use simply reinforces the states of mind that are required to use it. So using powers that draw on anger (which is honestly like nearly all the dark side powers) will make you a more and more angry person until you go evil.      
    This would also imply that using the dark side could just as easily "corrupt" you in ways that look radically different. It's just that we never see anyone corrupted into being super compassionate, happy or whatnot because there aren't any widespread force powers that draw on those emotions.

      I mean, some fan theories about Anakin's "romance" with Padme suggest this as a theory for the speed of their romance (i.e. Anakin let his own emotions spiral out of control and subconsciously mind tricked Padme as well).
      ```

      - u/vakusdrake:
        ```
        That would also serve as a potential reason why the Jedi would forbid romantic attachment.

    Pretty boring answer, but, if using the dark side raises the chances someone will use it again in the future, there's a feedback loop. If the first time guarantees near-certainty, then everyone who uses it is damned.

    One kind of interesting way you could do it would be, say, the Dark Side is extremely useful and the first two times you use it is free, and everyone knows it always makes you its puppet the third time. I think people would still routinely go for the third time, as two successes make them feel safe, despite the overwhelming evidence.

    > Conversely, how weak can a “dark side” be and you still get the same type of cultural warnings that you do in Star Wars, I.e. wise mentor characters are scared to use it even once accidentally (regardless of if this is actually true)?

    It's sufficient if instances of it going wrong come to mind more easily than instances of it going right. Which could just be one or two highly visible disasters, and a subtle or boring success case. Nuclear power, for example.

    Coupling this with subtle magic is actually a pretty unique flavor, I don't think I've seen that done. You usually see extreme subtle magic on a good-aligned mentor figure who's some sort of champion of the natural order. You could have a magic based on gaining subtle benefits by helping balance the forces of nature, which is completely safe except for those couple of times someone messed it up catastrophically and opened a portal to the realm of the Fey, inviting the Wild Hunt. Or necromancy consists of resolving the business of the restless dead in exchange for Death fudging the scales in favor of your safety, except for a couple notable times someone became a lich.
    ```

      > You usually see extreme subtle magic on a good-aligned mentor figure who's some sort of champion of the natural order.  

      I mean for all the utility of throwing around objects, the real value in the Force seems to be precognition and guidance to the right place at the right time.  The fanon that makes the most sense out of the prequel has Palpatine actively sabotaging the Jedi's connection to the will of the Force and precognition after they had grown over reliant on it.

      I like your examples.  I could see the "Dark Side" being a natural emergent outcome of exploiting or bending the rules in a way that creates a feedback loop.  Like with the necromancy examples... if you could use Death's favor to bend the rules to temporarily count yourself as dead and then both create and resolve your own restlessness in a cycle that spirals out of control.
      ```

  - u/callmesalticidae:
    ```
    A bit difficult to figure out, I think, if we don't have some other constraints set up first, but let's see what the extremes would look like: 

    > How potent does a “Dark Side” need to be to get run away feedback loops? I.e. you can’t even intentionally use it safely once because it has the potential to be so useful/addictive/corrupting/seductive.

    Obviously, a "Dark Side" that immediately completely rewrites your values would be a non-starter in most cases. People would only rarely use the Dark Side in this case: if they were idiots, if their values or meta-values were close enough to the Dark Side's anyway, or if they thought that the actions of their "Dark Self" could be constrained in the right way by outside forces. 

    Any of these criteria may not apply to a given Dark Side, depending on the nature of its corruption and the degree of its power. For example, if the Dark Side's corruption is an inversion of your current values, no matter what they may be (i.e. "Dark Hitler" would be a pretty nice guy), then nobody would accept Dark Side corruption on the basis that their values are already close enough to the Dark Side's. Or, if the Dark Side were so powerful that no possible outside force could impose a constraint on your actions, you obviously wouldn't accept Dark Side corruption on the basis that your Dark Self could somehow be forced to act in accordance with your present self's will. 

    > Conversely, how weak can a “dark side” be and you still get the same type of cultural warnings that you do in Star Wars, I.e. wise mentor characters are scared to use it even once accidentally (regardless of if this is actually true)?

    The Dark Side doesn't have to be inherently corrupting at all, just *easier*, in order to be warned against. For example, if "killing people with the Force" is "of the Dark Side," as some portrayals of Star Wars have it, then it might not be literally supernaturally corrupting so much as corrupting in the vein of "first you're throwing lightning at people, then you're choking them, then you're realizing you can just pinch their carotid artery, and somewhere along the line you start killing people who don't have to be killed, because 'kill them with the Force' is just so much easier than anything else that it's really, really easy to justify killing them."

  I've been working on this fictional [alternate timeline Venezuela](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17XdKfhcpd9xnfjPEwRIEQZXmxF42gW2ImOcqBrsyBp0/edit?usp=sharing) for a while as an exploration of the sorts of novel institutional designs in the rationalist sphere. If you see anything that's not explained in the doc or links, or notice some problems please let me know.

  I'm fairly proud of the unique urban planning and would like to make some sort of mock up to show off what it looks like (city skylines isn't remotely adequate). However I'm rather lacking in any artistic skills and I don't know what the best program to use for something like this would be (especially given all the vegetation), so I would appreciate any information about that.

  One question pertinent to my setting which I'd like some predictions on are what the cultural impact of a country so absurdly progressive for its time would be on the rest of the world. I'd also like predictions about what kind of resistance there would be to this rapid cultural shift, since I'm already expecting some domestic terrorism.

  Years ago, EY posted *[My April Fools' Day Confession](http://web.archive.org/web/20140406122655/http://lesswrong.com/lw/jzr/my_april_fools_day_confession/)* where he talks about an alternate Earth-like rational civilization called dath ilan. One part that particularly struck me was regarding the education system:


  >You've probably guessed that dath ilan did not have universities with sit-down classes where a professor lectured for three months.  We took education seriously in dath ilan, which in our world meant using professional specialization and economies of scale and large prizes and fast iteration.  One hour of instruction on a widely-used subject got the same kind of attention in dath ilan that an hour of prime-time TV gets on Earth.  By which I mean that there would be centralized development of movies you watched on your own, and the training-games you played in what I won't insult by calling it a school, and experiments to find out which variations worked.  Tell a real educator about how Earth classes are taught in three-month-sized units, and they would've sputtered and asked how you can iterate fast enough to learn how to teach that.  Tell them that the same universities that taught were also responsible for certifying that teaching had occurred successfully - that the performance of education, and the verification and certification of education, were carried out by the same financial entity - and they would have just turned and walked away.  Tell them that students paid up front whether the university succeeded or failed at training them, and they'd turn around and start yelling about dishonorable fraud.  *Everyone* understood that much economics where I come from.


  Assume you have been elected as the director of an education system with a 12-year training program and about 100,000 students of varying ages following a linear distribution ranging from 4 to 16 years-old. You are graded on the performance of your school system, with 60% of your grade based on your students' test scores, 20% of your grade based on early graduation rates, and 20% based on student satisfaction. Your annual pay will be equal to your score squared times a million dollars, so 100% gets you a million dollars, while 70% gets you about $490K.

  An outside agency will design, administer, and grade the tests instead of your teachers. The tests will be administered at fixed intervals based upon the students' ages and are designed to test for competency in subjects up to four years ahead of the planned curriculum. Grading is done on a numeric scale reflecting effective grade level, so +0 represents an average student who can correctly answer 90% of questions for their grade, while +1 represents an incredibly talented student who can correctly answer 90% of the questions for students one year ahead. You will get a full score if your students average at +1, and 0% score if your students average at +0.

  For early graduation rate, you will receive the full score if your students graduate at least a year early on average, and 0% if the average graduation time is no earlier than expected. This may seem redundant with the above, but serves as a disincentive for holding onto precocious students for as long as possible.

  For student satisfaction, the students will rate their happiness with the school and their classes, and your score here is based on their reported average happiness.

  Each year, if your students are graduating early, the expected graduation date will be pushed back by 10% of the difference. So, if your students graduate a year early on average, next year you'll be expected to get them to graduate 36.5 days earlier to still get the full bonus.

  If/when these reductions bring the expected program completion time to 11 years or less, a curriculum revision board will be arranged, consisting of 100 local volunteers - 20 college professors, 20 teachers from your program, 20 students, 20 parents, and 20 employers. This board will vote on new subjects to be added to the curriculum and on the details of what should be included and tested.

  Your educational system is funded with $1.5 billion annually. As the director, you have fairly broad discretion over how to allocate that funding for construction projects, teachers' salaries, teaching materials, school buses, support staff, etc., though you are audited for fraud, waste, and abuse to ensure against direct personal gain. If anyone has proof that you've entered into a fraudulent or abusive arrangement with them (or anyone else), they are entitled to 150% of whatever the gain would have been, provided you are convicted. If convicted, you will be assessed a fine equal to 200% of that payout, and may have assets seized to cover the cost. If that fails to cover the fine, you may be indefinitely kept on probation while your wages are garnished until it is paid off.

  To have been elected as the director, you must have at least one child in this school system. You have minimum standards to uphold in regards to cleanliness, fire safety, nurse availability, transportation of poor students, etc. and may be fined or even fired if audits find your schools aren't up to the standards, so use common sense. Aside from that, you have a term of four years before you need to worry about re-election.

  Given this, how do you maximize your income?

    Fuck, I'm on mobile and lost like a half hour long response because i accidentally lost the page. I'm just going to tldr my lost answer.

    They'll likely be some way to deal with problematic students, or students with health issues that require them to stop, or dead students, that give a way of removing them from being measured. Abuse this. Students witha poor/negligent/abusive upbringing are more likely to run afoul of rules you impose ("don't share food in case of allergies" while some students don't get enough to eat at home and need help) and students with mental health issues or poor impulse control will end up breaking rules too (don't verbally harrass others/start fights/get caught self-harming). Be as strict as possible on repeat offenses (3 strikes system), be eager to get rid of students who need additional medical/psychological help ("we just dont have the resources to give them the care they need/deserve"). "Culling" the students least likely to succeed, even if for reasons they can't control, will improve your results at the end of the day.

    You can also get some private investigators to pick at any weak links in the testing and oversights parts of the system you interact with. Understanding the way the people who will be making the tests think would give you some insight into how you'll need to prepare students, and you could even go further into blackmail or copying the tests before they are finished and applied to students. I don't know if your own private spending would be investigated as part of the oversight (and even then there are ways of being discreet), its just a matter of weighing if the path is worth it or not from the perspective of long-term financial gain.

    This isn't the spirit you likely intended when asking the question, but these are issues nonetheless.

  This is a story idea I’m kicking around. I follow rational and read a lot here, but I can’t promise this is rational. It’s made to just have this character that can do whatever and who would be the all powerful side character in other stories. It’s who we would all want to be, but I know in stories that takes the tension out. I think it could work as comedy/slice-of-life (depends on if I am actually funny). If it doesn’t sound good or rational, let me know with a comment. (I am aware it will need grammar and spelling passes, but if you like pointing out typos it won’t hurt my feelings)

  LFG (Looking For Goals)

  [transmission start]
   Sigh. 
  What is a man to do when he’s done everything? This is the question I face every day. 
  (Make sure you go back and reread that in a despondent voice, not a proud voice. If you are lucky enough to be in a reality where this humble posting gets narrated, I trust the narrator to capture the spirit of this, perhaps rereading it here. And yes, noble bards, audio jockeys, and voice actors, you should read this too. You are doing a fine job. Just wanted to let you know that. I have consumed a lot of audio works of all varieties while focused on my magic endeavors, keep it up.) I seem to have got sidetracked, so continuing on what do I do?

  Attached Here you will find my Resume (read: Life Goals) so you can get a sense of who I am now.

  Craft artifacts for all stat levels [DONE]

  Create Own Spell [DONE]

  Master custom time compression spell [DONE]

  Fall in love [DONE]

  Resurrect Wife [DONE]

  Destroy Bachius for killing my wife [DONE]

  Have a life together with wife [DONE]

  Reverse Old Age and Stop Death - Absolute Resurrection [DONE]
  Note: Interdicted by gods. Talked to wife and she is happy and safe in the heaven realm of her god. No plans to kill gods yet.

  Gods beg for help saving a plane of existence, so help for removal of interdiction on Absolute Ressurection [DONE]
  Note: Given new continent in planet Kazvum on that was the result of saving this planet’s threatened plane of existence. Interdiction on Absolute Resurrection partially removed.

  Complete spellbook [DONE]
  Note: All known spells from this plane and original plane recorded.

  Catalog known planes of existence [DONE]

  Complete spellbook (2) [DONE]
  Note: All known spells from the planes it is possible to travel to recorded.

  Create New Spells [DONE]
  Note: Now I can literally create spells on the fly for anything, so I just have anything new I create auto record into the master spell library.

  Attain godhood [DONE]
  Note: Undid this. This sucked. I am effectively more powerful here than as a god due to the (undecipherable) politics. They are scared I will come back now.

  Design better heavens [DONE]
  Note: Running an engaging afterlife is a lot of work. This is why most are blissed out zones, voids, or torture by demons. No maintenance.

  Automate better heaven [DONE]

  Kill Zoltameka for shredding wife's soul [DONE]
  Note: Killing her took me a literal hour subjective time. Ended up wiping out her entire pantheon. All souls they had were transferred to one of the heavens I set up before. Killing the gods is too easy now, no challenge.

  Get wife's soul back [DONE]
  Note: Can't recreate souls once fully dispersed. Process if needed again: had to travel to the second she was destroyed while perfectly concealed from reality, contain all soul fragments, then come back to the present, and then piece them together to avoid a paradox this time. Wife is now in heaven 2438926.

  Rescue all shredded souls [DONE]

  Catalog all types of living creatures [DONE]
  Note: Started a business for fun using some of this info. The ability to just portal one over from them saves me a few seconds compared to creating one from the catalog scan.

  Design construct versions of everything [DONE]

  Go back in time and create giant lizards and giant bird lizards. [DONE]
  Note: This was done when I was too bored (and maybe high on an experimental potion). Looks like I added them to literally everywhere on page 5328 of the planes catalog. Choosing not to undo them. Its fun to see what they are named by people.

  Fix all the stupid names people gave my creations [DONE]
  Note: They are called dinosaurs now in common. May have gotten too overprotective on the names, but the ones I didn't like are changed now. Floofadoodlemus is a terrible name. Almost wiped that person out of existence, need to be careful and not smite sentients. Spinosaurus is a much better name.

  Master cooking literally anything that is not made from sapients [DONE]
  Note: Best dish is Brontosaurus Shoulder glazed with Venluvial Honey and lightly roasted Lignatol tubers.

  Duplicate anything mundane with or without magic [DONE]

  Master science in this plane and all others [DONE]

  Stop all possible "universe optimizers." [DONE] 
  Note: Setup macro against this everywhere I can currently find. I’ll have to address new universes as they pop up if they don’t automatically get tagged.

  ——————

  This is not the story of how I did all those things. This is not how I became who I am. Honestly, my story started so long ago that I’d probably get details wrong. Everything since the Perfect Memory spell is clear, but before that, the memory/data just didn’t exist the same way.
  There is also a chance I just will lie to you for your own good. I have my share of “forbidden knowledge” (read: antimemes, infohazards, eldritch phone number equivalents (that reminds me, Grtchlkpg, mental dial me again if you see this. I have a better plan this time. I blame Kevin for last time.), and all the multiverses’ languages’ grammar rules) you don’t want to know.

  Kevin got me on this, so blame him for the rambling. Retroactive Edit: Kevin has/did/will inform me that this is not what he meant. Oh well, the Multiversal Post spell has to be good for something besides the royalties from creating it, so I’m using it for this Kevin. 
  I have been informed people dislike someone who is “overpowered” and I think that’s ridiculous. Someone “overpowered” us who you want as a friend when some intergalactic power wants to demolish your planet to make way for a hyperspace lane. 

  Anyway, I could spend all day with asides. (Ss was reported in most realities that received this post, so here is a retroactive edit to preempt that in the now prime timeline. Instead, I will leave all of my asides in footnotes starting from this point on. You may notice some above depending on your realities function of linearity. Except the very first ones and this one. I am forcing you to read this. Actually you could stop reading, but then you won’t find out what this is about.)

  My original plane/universe functioned on what many realities call Adventure Spelunking 16th edition, Dungeons & Dragons 5th edition, or the fantasy realms in Zwaehander Piercing Realms - Jacked In For Life. This post is directed to some point in your time stream and planet where at least one of those exists or existed and is researchable. I’ll leave that as an exercise to the reader, listener, or krlchm (if that doesn’t translate, just crunch rocks together for the right sound). Retroactive Edit: I will get better with footnotes in future posts, this one is too much trouble as the starting point. Beware this may not be linear chronologically after this post, but a parity spell forces this one to be first if listed)
  Anyway, I would be way, way, way past level 20. (Heard of aleph numbers? Versaucius can teach you if you find his tube of knowledge.) 

  You saw my accomplished life goals. 
  You saw the ?. I am looking for interesting individuals to become acquainted with.

  I am bored. 


  Consider this a challenge, friend request, gauntlet thrown, rose stomped, whatever your specific reality or culture calls whatever this is.

   I need something to do. If you live/work in a universe with hard alignments I don’t specifically exclude you, but if your alignment is more towards evil we may have some philosophical differences. 
  Fear not though, I have had a few friends who have shifted alignments (or not changed) because I cleaned up some of their actions’ repercussions. Yes Kevin I’m talking about you. In my universe, or at least my original universe, I am considered true neutral. I used to have a good alignment but the ennui of the countless ages kind of numbed me to the fact of everything. Besides I don’t think karma or whatever all these multiverses use was made to handle the actions at my scale. Supposedly destroying a universe is infinitely negative karma, but it’s not infinitely positive if you re-create it perfectly. And there was never a karma value assigned to completely redoing all of the afterlifes to be positive and to prevent people from turning into just happiness pumps or being insane or being tortured. But I digress.

   Give me an adventure idea. I will post this to specific places across multiple universes/realities through my spell. If no one reaches out, I’ll probably just go visit Kevin again. I still need to get him back for what he did to my dinosaurs…
