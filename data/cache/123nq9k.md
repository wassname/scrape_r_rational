## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  I have just restarted reading Worm, and godamn is it good! Usually when I reread something I swim through a sea of cloudy memories, but with Worm, I was eagerly awaiting some of my favorite moments. If any of you haven't read it yet I heavily recommend it.

          The school portion is >!very short!<, if that helps your interest, but soon after that it becomes clear that the scope of the story is going to be larger than just the whole >!who killed the Carmine Beast investigation!< and at that point I decided to wait for it to finish - I’d sorta thought it was close to ending. Seeing as how it’s still being written, who knows when I’ll read it

          > I ended up losing interest when they enrolled in a magical high school, can't remember which arc that was.

          Arc 4, IIRC.

          > Did it improve past there? 

          Yes, and it doesn't last that long.

          > I'm just so thoroughly uninterested in magical school stories that it actively disappoints me when stories pivot to them.

          The girls' time at the BHI was a subversion of the usual "magical school" tropes. As someone who also finds them an overworn setting in fiction I enjoyed it much more than I first expected.

          > I'm just so thoroughly uninterested in magical school stories that it actively disappoints me when stories pivot to them.

          I'd argue the problem is that, well, a lot of magical school stories build the school first, and then the world after - making a mess of worldbuilding. The school in Pale is a place in a wider world, and even then, they don't stay in it long. (>!and it devolves into a war arc anyways!<)

          >I ended up losing interest when they enrolled in a magical high school

          Bummer. I loved this part, it felt unique to me and I don't think it has the problems most "X magical high school genre" settings do. To me the only similarity is that it's at a school.

          The magic in setting is so varied and ill-explored but there's still so much that can be useful to everyone, if not direct small tricks/principles then just knowing more of what something is when you see it. In addition to the cutthroat nature of the school/setting and genuine high stakes (in universe worse than death, in meta Wildbow's willingness to kill/maime main characters).

          All of those factors set it apart in my opinion, so it's less of a magic high school and more of a "casual" death match/domination game happening with the pretense of being a school. Also I loved the "high school" level explanations of the huge variety of different magics, in addition to seeing their beginning practitioners.

      Worm and Twig were my favorites, with myself giving Worm the edge due to the high octane action but thoroughly enjoying Twig as well. but I didn't really like Pact or Ward. Haven't read Pale yet, can't comment

  I saw *The Menu* over the weekend and quite liked it. While it's not quite a "one room" movie, it's pretty close. It's got great acting, beautiful cinematography, and an interesting story. It's a horror comedy that satirizes celebrity culture and obnoxious, out-of-touch, wealthy/famous people.

  Spoilers, but it's basically an adult version of >!Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory!< (you can see a full comparison [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/yy99jo/official_discussion_the_menu_spoilers/iwtfqxx/))

    Hmm, my problem with the movie was that no one had any agency until the very end when >!Margot!< orders the >!cheeseburger!< , so it felt a bit frustrating for me. Though I won't deny that the cinematography is absolutely beautiful.

  Not sure this is the right place to ask, bur I'm looking for an old fic i used to read but can't remember the name of.

  It was about a guy isekaied into a world under constant zombie threat who proceeds to bring industrialization, beginning with the Bessemer process and guns to the world. He also falls in love with a questionably sane magician researcher if that helps, and the magic system heavily features summoning stones for bigger effects.

  Can anyone help me out with the name?

  What published works are there where characters use logic and reason to sort through their problems? I love web fiction, don't get me wrong, but I just want to see what's out there. I've looked at the recommended works over in the Wiki, and there seemed to be a real lack in fiction that wasn't originally published online (not counting what was considered rational adjacent, which I think is much more vague). Books like [The World of Null A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World_of_Null-A) are a good example of what I'm looking for. The older the better, and while fantastical elements are appreciated they are not necessary.

  Hello! I am fairly new to this sub but have been reading RR and other sites for a while now. I am looking for anything well written like Worm, Worth The Candle, or Mother of learning. I have read or at least looked at most stuff at the top of RR, so I am mainly looking for hidden gems on RR or a web serial I may have missed.  


  I also wanted to make a recommendation for the story [Memories Of The Fall](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/36051/memories-of-the-fall). It is a well written kind of slow pace cultivation story with really good world building. It also has some of the longest chapters I have ever seen on RR lol
  ```

  - u/ThePhrastusBombastus:
    ```
    **[A Practical Guide to Evil](https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2015/03/25/prologue/)** comes to mind. It's really well-written and plays around with storytelling conventions (as in they are a very real force within the setting). The main character acts intelligently, but still fucks up from time to time and has to learn from her mistakes.

    There are other web serials and some good fanfiction that I could recommend, but APGtE sounds the most like what you're looking for.
    ```

  - u/meangreenking:
    ```
    I'm going to second the rec for Memories of The Fall. It does a lot of unique stuff really well I've never seen done at all/well in Xianxia. That said my rec does come with some major cavets.

    1) Its slow and stuff takes forever to happen. This may be a pro if you have enough reading time though.

    2) It shifts POV a lot, which hurts cause its so slow and stays with each POV char so long. YMMV but its probably worth it to skip the twin (?) sisters and come back to them after you've read everything else since they never get back to the starting world or interacting with the main plot before the last posted chapter.

    3) This isn't a traditional RR power fantasy. Bad things happen to the protagonists that aren't followed up by the MC face-slapping the bad guy fifty times and killing them.

  Any recommendations for good historical fiction (set in past historical times, doesn't necessarily need to have plausibly *happened*).  

  I recently read through a chunk of Vinland Saga, which gave me the taste for it. A Viking tale of revenge, and of working past it. Though I don't think I'd rec Vinland Saga, the themes are kindof thrown at your face and there's an unpleasant amount of insistence that it is 'deep'.. while not actually having that interesting of character development. Though, a lot of people like it, so I might just be being picky.  
  I'd be kinda interested in a more 'lawful good' utilitarian take on it, >!where you have no enemies, because all humans should have a place to live and be happy, but that there are many hard decisions so that you can approach that!<. However, I'm not sure how well it would work in the setting.

  Recommendations:   
  - Lest Darkness Fall, which was recommended last week. Short but good time travel uplift without doing anything extreme in terms of uplift.  
  - [Kusuriya no Hitorigoto](https://mangadex.org/title/e18fe8c6-f6dc-4f05-8462-7b2083ff9a6c/kusuriya-no-hitorigoto): posted here previously. Historical Japan medicine mystery-solving. Good, and has enough of an overarching story to not be pure slice-of-life.  
  - [Jin](https://mangadex.org/title/ec86fe52-2294-4244-99ce-1981cfc950ad/jin): Medical uplift in Edo Japan. Decent.  
  - [I Reincarnated as a Legendary Surgeon](https://mangadex.org/title/feebe1dc-64ef-47a6-b4ed-07f47dd330cd/i-reincarnated-as-a-legendary-surgeon): Reincarnation with some uplift. Decent.
  ```

  - u/k5josh:
    ```
    [Sanitize](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12431866/1/Sanitize) isn't historical but it is historic_ish_ -- set in _Naruto_, but it's long before the events of the manga & the main Insert character doesn't have any metaknowledge, so you can basically just pretend it's Sengoku Japan with a bit of magical ninjas sprinkled in. Slow medical (& ethical!) uplift.

  TV shows, I'm from the [Tyler Cowen school](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2022/03/how-to-find-good-tv-shows.html) and roughly don't watch/enjoy any. 

  Are there any superhero/heroine ones that won't make me close my tab in disgust by flagrantly violating /r/rational standards of quality and coherency in the first 10 minutes? Or is that doomed until we get Worm/Alexander Wales/Nimble Mongoose Vid-GPT fan projects?
  ```

  - u/thomas_m_k:
    ```
    [Invincible](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6741278/) was pretty okay. Though the main character isn't the smartest.
    ```

    - u/SvalbardCaretaker:
      ```
      That seemed extremely gory and brutal going by the large amount of memes the evil superman guy spawned? If that guy doesn't feature that much in his psychopathic ways I'd give it a try.
      ```

      - u/fljared:
        ```
        I would say the gore is a relatively small part of the show, and mostly used as neccesary to give weight to a handful of scenes. (As opposed to, say, *Superjail* feeding prisoners into a blender) It's not till the last episode, with it's climactic fight, that the violence feels wanton, but there it also relfects the gravity of the stakes (and not just in an edgy, "Garth Ennis hates superheros" way). That one's also likely the one you sw the memes from.
        ```

      - u/dysfunctionz:
        ```
        I was also going to recommend the HBO Harley Quinn, but that is similarly extremely gory (though unlike Invincible, it's played mostly for comedy).

        Otherwise it's worth watching as a clever (and IMO hilarious) deconstruction of superhero (and DC comics in particular) tropes. Most of the main characters suffer from various forms of mental illness so don't make very rational decisions, but their actions are believable in that context.
        ```

          Seconding this. It had a couple cringe-worthy moments, but overall I really enjoyed it.

          Harley Quinn was way better than I had expected. It absolutely works as a deconstruction of the DC universe and has more heart and soul than most DC media.
          ```

      - u/thomas_m_k:
        ```
        It is unfortunately excessively gory. I skipped a lot of that stuff and was able to follow the story regardless, but yeah, sounds like it's not for you. Sorry!

    ```
    There's a lot of excellent tv out there - I'm surprised that Tyler Cowen would write that in 2022. Most movies are rather bland tentpoles designed to get butts in seats. 

    1. Harley Quinn animated HBO show is exceptionally good and deals a lot of interpersonal relationships. It's barely a superhero show and is stronger for it.
    2. The boys starts strong but has mostly been navel gazing this recent season. It gives me work vibes to some extent though less deconstruction of good v bad heroes but rather what would corporate America do to super heroes.
    3. Invincible was decent too and has some strong continuity.
    4. Watchmen the tv show was also excellent, though almost no super powers.

    Super hero fiction tends to suffer from most of /r/rational pet peeves which is why it's kind of overrepresented here. But there are a lot more types of fiction that have wonderful tv

    1. Succession is the best show on TV right now and just had a banger of an opening episode
    2. Veep is an incredible comedy that was underwatched by many
    3. Atlanta is one of the best shows of all time
    4. Better Call Saul was better than Breakikg Bad.
    5. Patriot (Amazon prime) is a weird show that I can't stop thinking about
    6. It's always sunny in Philadelphia is the best comedy for the past 10 years.
    7. The good place came and went and left a mark
    8. The rehearsal remains the wildest thing I've ever seen on TV and it's impossible to tear your eyes away from it 

    And shows I've heard are great but haven't watched yet

    1. Andor
    2. For all mankind
    3. Station eleven 
    4. Euphoria
    5. The bear
    6. Severance
    7. Pachinko
    ```

  - u/Dragongeek:
    ```
    *The Boys* is pretty good. Sorta has a rationalist bent because most protagonists are mundanes trying to assassinate superpowered individuals, bypassing their powers in clever ways to do so (eg placing remote control explosives inside the guy with invulnerable skin). 

    Feels a bit like Sanderson's *Steelheart*
    ```

    - u/Makin-:
      ```
      I don't know if this is the case in the comic, but in the show everyone gets stupider and more reactive over time. The first season is pretty good by anyone's standards though.
      ```

  - u/fljared:
    ```
    Unfortunately most superhero works are riffing on genre conventions in a fashion that sort of assumes a lot of things as background. *Invincible*  is great, but I don't know if it worldbuilding stands up to scrutiny.
    ```

  - u/Bowbreaker:
    ```
    I really liked most of Jessica Jones. Just ignore that the other Marvel characters supposedly exist and live in the same city. As long as they don't appear it doesn't matter.

    Season 1 of raising Dion wasn't disgustingly terrible. Season 2 was though.
    ```

  - u/andor3333:
    ```
    I enjoyed the short fiction Bruce Kent by Eliezer Yudkowsky, for its clever handling of a secret identity. It is about a superhero whose secret identity is just staggeringly obvious, and everybody “knows”, but in spite of countless people’s best efforts nobody can actually prove it. [Part 1](https://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/post/188511784460/prokopetz-bad-superhero-whose-secret-identity), [Part 2](https://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/post/188572976735/mirasorastone-yudkowsky-prokopetz-bad), [Part 3](https://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/post/190740125660/yudkowsky-mirasorastone-yudkowsky).

    Also the short story “[And I Show You How Deep The Rabbit Hole Goes](https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/06/02/and-i-show-you-how-deep-the-rabbit-hole-goes/)”, based on a popular shared post about pills that give you superpowers. 

    Also I remember liking one called [Heroes Save The World](https://heroessavetheworld.wordpress.com/2016/09/06/big-change-ch-1-simon-martin/), but I only read the first few chapters. The heroes all made clever use of their powers. Even ones like making pennies disappear.

- u/Relevant_Occasion_33:
  ```
  Any good, not necessarily rational, fiction about cooking food and/or eating it?
  ```

  - u/Radioterrill:
    ```
    Dungeon Meshi is the first one that comes to mind. 

    The story is initially about a group of adventurers who need to reach the bottom of the dungeon to resurrect their friend, and to achieve this they need to cook and eat the monsters they find along the way, with each chapter structured around a meal. There's a lot of comedy, but also a lot of thought put into every detail of the world and the setting rules are consistently followed. As the series progresses, a theme of desires and what we do to attain them emerges, with a few situations that remind me of the AI box and the fun theory essays.

    Assuming it keeps up the high level of quality for the last few chapters, it'll join Fullmetal Alchemist on my very short list of manga that I'll recommend without reservations.

    It also has a Trigger anime adaptation coming out, for those who prefer that format.
    ```

    - u/JAGGGER:
      ```
      I also recommend Dungeon Meshi. Finding/cooking/eating food is a big part of the story on an object level, but it also manages to be very relevant to how the characters grow and the high level narrative of the story, which I find really satisfying.
      ```

  - u/SvalbardCaretaker:
    ```
    Ranma 1/2 has a hilarious arc about battle eating. https://chapmanganato.com/manga-is957453/chapter-165

    You might wanna read chapter 1-5 to get a feel for the characters.

    edit: I just reread the arc. Its a comedic masterpiece, but the teenage nudity has not aged well at all. NSFW!
    ```

  - u/Jokey665:
    ```
    probably as far from rational as it gets, but man i loved watching Yakitate Japan, which is an anime about baking bread. The manga is good too, but I think it falls off after the parts that got adapted.
