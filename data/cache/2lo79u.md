  So, if Harry is a horcrux (as he is in cannon) why isn't he indestructible?

  EDIT: Or at least only vulnerable to Basilisk venom and feyndfire.
  ```

  - u/l_ugray:
    ```
    We currently have no evidence either way as to his destructibility.
    ```

  - u/E-o_o-3:
    ```
    It could be that the host object is destructible, but the soul attachent isn't (so you can rip up the painting, but the soul can just go to another portrait - or you can tear up the diary, but one or more pieces still have the horcrux attached).
    ```

- u/None:
  ```
  So this was the chapter where we reference canon!HP all in the right order... and in which all the heroes go "OH FUCK" as they realize how thorough Quirrellmort really was.

  Also, dealing with this kind of villain is what the [Pandorica](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Pandorica) was made for: when your villain *might escape by dying*.
