## Think hard before recommending literature here.

### Post:

Hi folks,

I've mulled about this in the past, and have decided to post about something I've seen happening when I recommend works I enjoy on this subreddit.

A couple years back, I made a post about  serial fiction, then saw, within a day or two, the author lamenting negative reviews and low stars ratings.

Months later, I tried my own hand at writing something, posted it here, saw my post get downvoted, then saw my own stars rating get annihilated.

This has happened at least two more times since then.

Now, a reasonable person reading this might draw the conclusion that my taste in writing and ability as an author simply suck, and I should cowboy up and move along.

To this strawman, I say "Maybe?"

But here's the thing. On the balance, more people seem to respond favorably to what I write than otherwise. It's apparent that at least some of those seeking reading recommendations here get some value from what I've recommended here.

The problem is, the writers don't seem to benefit from this. The handful of additional readers a recommendation sends their way is offset by the ratings hit they take for that same recommendation.

For this reason, I have to de-recommend the act of posting recommendations on this subreddit.

Man, I wish I could feel otherwise.

EDIT: Lots of response to this, including a fair amount to consider. I'll summarize the stuff I found useful, below.

* /u/WalterTFD is an author who believes the exposure is worth the risk.
* /u/Allanther is another author who has found his experience with redditors here to be largely positive as well as useful.
* /u/catern pointed out that the risk is much higher for recommending works not matching the collective taste of this subreddit.
* /u/valeskas believes it is best to recommend only with regard for bringing joy to other readers. Also notes that more in-depth recommendations can help.

Having read through, debated, and discussed things a bit, I think there is some worthwhile stuff here.

*I'd revise my advice as follows:*

* *Freely recommend works that are self-hosted, or else shared from platforms without ratings systems.*
* *Works from authors already popular on* /r/rational, *as well as those close in feel or theme are less risky to recommend.*
* *For any other works you would like to recommend, help readers on this site avoid works they will not enjoy, and help the author as well by providing as much detail as possible about the work you recommend. If a reader doesn't like what you're describing, they're unlikely to have a bad experience reading it and pass along a low rating as a result.*

  I feel like, hmm, I agree with you on the object level of what happens when you post here, disagree on the recommendation at the end?

  Like, posting here gets a bunch of argumentative nerds to read the thing and then, being a bunch of argumentative nerds, we tear it down disproportionate to how much we boost it up.  Cop to that, guilty as charged, officer.  We have a bad habit of being all 'prove why you are worthy of providing us free content!'.

  But, like, the thing of it is that most fics out there aren't, like, cruising on hundreds of readers and just need a few more.  Most of them have basically zero readers and zero discussion.  Their comment sections are huge wastelands broken up by the occasional, treasured 'good story, thanks for writing' post.

  Authors in that boat need engagement above all else.  The readers on this board, whatever other flaws we may have, do read the stuff we review.  (Obviously, this is a generalization, but a substantial percentage of blah blah blah..)

  In conclusion, I agree that advertising a story here has a greater than average chance of getting some negative reviews, but I think that's offset (in most cases) by the fact that it will get reviews/posts at all.  No bad attention, etc.

  Money where my mouth is and all that, I wrote 'The Fifth Defiance' ([https://thefifthdefiance.com/2015/11/02/introduction/](https://thefifthdefiance.com/2015/11/02/introduction/)) , if y'all want to tear me down, come on by!

    This is a good point. Any degree of exposure and readership is going to bring in new eyes and new critics. Especially from a place like /r/rational, which is rather prone to nitpicking, but hopefully not more toxic forms of criticism. Nonetheless, I can definitely understand the pain of a budding author who feels like their work is being torn to shreds with criticism.

    I'm not sure what specific examples the OP is referring to, but if the stories are being posted on Royal Road, /r/rational might not be entirely to blame. Getting a rapid influx of ratings and reviews on the platform will put you on the Trending page, which means a lot of potential readers will be reviewing your work. And yes, usually that means your ratings will go down, at least momentarily. (On the other hand maybe /r/rational does lead to more critiques, I wouldn't have any first-hand experience here)

    In general, I agree with the sentiment here. It's always good to think before posting, especially when you are introducing someone else's work. Another thing that can help is to explain your recommendation a bit more, so that you perhaps turn away some of the readers who never would have enjoyed the story in the first place (I don't think anyone here reads something just to give it a bad rating).
    ```

    - u/Brell4Evar:
      ```
      I specifically did not want to call out those giving negative ratings. I don't see that as particularly constructive; those doing so won't be inclined to change, and the post would just make an argument.

      My purpose isn't to yell at the alligators, or drive them off. It's placing a "Beware of alligators" sign.
      ```

  - u/Brell4Evar:
    ```
    /u/WalterTFD Hey, thanks for writing and having the guts to put it out there. I'll absolutely give it a read.

    It's good to hear from an author who feels differently about this.

    >if y'all want to tear me down, come on by!

    Some constructive criticism: The index...

    I really liked the story and wanted to finish it, but I have balked at trying to find where I left it about 3 times since then. For context I left it >!shortly after Zilla was introduced!<. I am struggling to think of a worse index. Preventer 9:3? So, this is chapter three from the ninth arc, with a note at the start of the PoV character? No, next chapter is Indulger 8:1...

    With love
    ```

    - u/WalterTFD:
      ```
      More than fair!  If I ever do another story, I'll definitely do a better index.
      ```

      - u/Bowbreaker:
        ```
        You could just edit your index to also have a general overarching number. So Preventer 9:3 becomes 21 - Preventer 9:3 or whatever.
        ```

  - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
    ```
    Honestly, I've been posting here chapters of my fic for years now, and most of them cruise comfortably on 30-40 upvotes and a dozen comments. Nothing to write home about, but in the end it's probably still the biggest source of readers I have besides "people randomly finding it on FFnet/AO3". And it's not like actually there are many other places where you can just up and make a post about your new chapter. r/Fanfiction doesn't allow this, and the subreddit of my fandom has virtually no fanfiction either.
    ```

- u/Allanther:
  ```
  I would like to disagree with you, but, as a recent member, I don't have the background to construct a statistical analysis of the pros and cons of posting a new fiction here.  Nor do I have the motivation to engage in statistical analysis of anything even if I did.

  What I do have is self-promo posting experience as a new royal road author to this subreddit.  So, I believe I can post from personal experience (famous last words, I know).  

  What I personally experienced here was a good selection of people, both who enjoyed and didnâ€™t enjoy my work.  I'm super happy about those who enjoy it.  Those who didn't make me a little sad, like seeing a puppy not getting adopted but having neither the time or money to do anything about it.

  In the middle of those two, I got some really good criticism that will allow me to better my story.  While it's hard to determine if they came from here, the timelines coincide enough for me to make a general guess.  

  So, while I can personally see your argument, my unfact-checked opinion is that the conclusion is off.  Rather than not recommend works at all, I would argue that works should be recommended after a certain posting time.  For example, if I was hit by possible negative critics within the first few days, it might have tanked my work.  After 1-2 months?  I either was already successful or already tanking.  Harsh criticism wouldn't derail my project any more than I had or hadn't already done so myself.

  I guess that's my long-winded way of saying I'm glad I was recommended here.  Then again, that recommendation was also what allowed me to discover this sub, so I am partially biased.

  Hmm. I can see where you're coming from, but your experience on this sub has been markedly different from my own.

  I've written one novel-length work so far, but I didn't post it to Royal Road, instead building my own little website so I could have more freedom and control. I wrote it with this audience in mind, specifically because my taste in fiction overlaps extremely heavily with what gets posted here.

  I didn't post it here until it was complete, and it didn't get a huge amount of attention. It did generate a bit of lively discussion, which helped me fix a few technical and literary glitches.

  Funny enough, my story was discussed on one of the /r/r adjacent Discord servers lately, and some of the criticism was much harsher. Even so, I never felt that criticism was unfair, and one piece of negative feedback just about sent me into giggling fits because it was actually such a huge backhanded compliment.

  This hasn't come out as coherently as I intended, so I'll try to say what I'm thinking plainly. I think your concern is valid if you're optimizing for the metric of fewest negative reviews. In my case, I knew out the gate that my story would have an extremely limited readership, and I expected some amount of negative feedback, but it was worth it to me to share my creative output with this community. It takes a *lot* of writing to become an AW or a qntm or an EY, and *those* writers are *far* from immune to criticism even on this sub. But other communities don't have the same kind of discussion this one does, and that's worth the candle to me on its own.
  ```

  - u/Brell4Evar:
    ```
    At this point, I've convinced myself that RR, in particular the rating system they use, is a large part of the problem. The ***Trending*** and ***Recommended For You*** features are driven by their ratings.

    Having experienced a thimbleful of RR authorship, I can certainly see the attractiveness of creating your own site.
    ```

    - u/gramineous:
      ```
      I don't spend much time in the RR community, I just read stuff there and maybe join an author's Discord, but I can't imagine that the rating system isn't being treated differently by casual RR users versus serious users. If you enjoy a story, you know that good ratings will get more eyes on the thing you enjoy, so you might as well give it a perfect score to help out the author and help them keep their income going. If you're someone from a non-RR space who is just reviewing it since you're the type to write reviews, even if you enjoy thw work, you don't have the same goals in giving a rating. You could also say something about how someone looking for popcorn wish fulfilment would give that popcorn wish fulfilment story a 5/5, regardless of how good its grammar, prose, plot, etc. is. Trying to boil down ratings to a number has a host of issues, especially when there's no understood standard for how you should be scoring something (ie. Is getting bored of a story and dropping it after 3 entire books of content a 1 star because you don't want to read it, a 5 star because it kept you entertained for several books, or anything in between?)

      Anyway number ratings are dumb but the system is easy enough to make functional, and a system that encourages big numbers looks good to new eyes joining the site.
      ```

- u/Dragfie:
  ```
  A bit late to the party, but I think my opinion is a bit of a hot take here:

  Well Duh, the audience which a community attracts that advertises itself as 'for smart people' will obviously correlate with entitled pricks. And going to the site to downvote a rec you don't like, rationalized with "giving meaningful criticism" to "put it in its place" is absolutely something an entitled prick would do?

  I think the recent Delve drama is a clear example off this: What kind of person wants to ban a story from being rec'd here because they don't like it? An entitled prick who rationalizes their position with "it doesn't belong here! I'm actually doing everyone a favor, totally not just getting constantly annoyed at seeing people enjoy something I don't think they should!" that's who.  
  (To be fair the argument was mostly about the top level weekly post, but the point here is that individuals who fit the above stereotype would absolutely be correlated with this sub's community)

  This community has a bad reputation, and for good reason. This sort of reaction should be expected IMHO.

  This comes as a surprise to me.  Looking up your posting history, you seem to be the author of The Elemental Arena, which, as I recall, was pretty well-received here, and seems to have a high rating on RoyalRoad.

  Was that an exception to the above noted annihilation, or was the negative impact from readers in this sub overwhelmed by others?
  ```

  - u/Brell4Evar:
    ```
    The Elemental Arena was /u/Gilgilad7's work, which I enjoyed reading and discussing.

    This one's mine:

    [https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/30389/a-convenient-fiction](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/30389/a-convenient-fiction)

    Be warned, rough draft, unfinished, indefinite hiatus.
    ```

    - u/Nimelennar:
      ```
      I apologize; I misread some of your comments on one of the Elemental Arena posts and thought that you were replying as the author.

      That said, I looked at [the post](https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/fg2u2s/a_convenient_fiction/) on r/rational for your story, and it's sitting at +29, with 88% upvotes (I can't get the math to work out to a whole number; 33 up and 4 down is 89% up, where 34 up and 5 down is 87% up).  At a glance, most of the criticism in the comments looks constructive.  And the RR rating is >4.5 stars, from 8 ratings.  So I'm still left wondering what "annihilation" you're referring to.  Is this story an outlier from the effect you're describing, or are 5 downvotes and what I calculate to be at most one two-star review (if the other seven are all five stars) really the kind of negative effect of posting here that would lead you to discourage people from doing it?
      ```

      - u/Allanther:
        ```
        I understand this is a question for him, but hopefully an answer from me would be somewhat acceptable.

        If my first criticism was a 2/5, and it took weeks before I got the next one, two, however many... then yeah.  That initial 2 score would be emotional devastating.

        Devastating enough to stop writing that story, anyway.   I wouldnâ€™t go out sniping kittens over it.  

        Even if later reviews brought it up weeks later, the initial... rejection?... would have been enough to significantly alter my opinion.  

        The cost/benefit analysis for continuing to write would have showed me in the red for long enough to call it a wash and chuck it.  And if I loved writing and dreamed of being a writer (which I do and do), then that negative would be an even bigger injury.  

        That's just my personal internet stranger viewpoint, for whatever it's worth.
        ```

      - u/Brell4Evar:

        I don't mind discussing the post you produced. The discussion wasn't bad for me - productive, in fact.

        What we're discussing now is close to, but not quite what my original post is about. The post you copied started by getting downvoted into the negative range. Note this bit:

        >Edit: Hey, just to be clear, it's okay if you don't like it, but useful criticism rather than quiet downvotes would be appreciated. Not much I can learn from, otherwise!

        Readers responded well to that, and I got some fairly useful feedback.

        At the same time, I saw a couple of  <=1 star ratings pop up in RR following the link, dropping the rating close to 3. Looks like it recovered nicely from then.

        Hearing from other authors who experienced the same drop in rating after I recommended them made me feel kind of ill. I want to share what I enjoy with others, but not at the authors' expense.

  Perhaps your recommendations don't fit the taste of this subreddit. Yes, if you aren't confident something fits the tastes of /r/rational, don't recommend it on this subreddit. That seems like a good policy for everyone.

  - u/Freevoulous:
    ```
    While this is true, if nobody posted works that go against the grain of this sub the quality of the sub would quickly deteriorate. We would drown in a deluge of near identical wish-fulfilment isekai and generic cultivator stories.   


    One one end, this sub wants to promote rational good writing and rationalist stories. On the other, it is enamoured with silly litRPG escapism. As we see again and again, these two roads are usually NOT convergent. Probably the closest to a story that is BOTH decently rational AND rpg-escapist is Mother Of Learning, and 99% of content here is not as good as MoL (which itself is just good-ish).  


    If people like op are not here to go against the grain, we will soon be "rational" only in name. And that would be damn shame.

    Hello!

    A few things to say about this:

    First, you're clearly right, at least in part. The pitfall I've come across isn't rationalism, however. I'm not reading criticisms about rationality so much as style. There's what I'd call an ambivalence in this community. Some redditors will enjoy a recommendation, while others will not. It's *rare* for a new work with the quality of HPMoR. If we only recommend high-grade gems of pure rationality, this place will be a lot less interesting.

    Second, how does one come to understand the tastes of this place without dumpster fires being started for the authors they enjoy? I'll agree with your solution, but I'd add the caveat that nobody should feel confident enough to recommend anything here that is present on RR or other sites where ratings can significantly impact an author's readership. The risk vs payoff for the author simply isn't there.

    Finally, I note this topic has already scored at least one down-vote. I expect more to come. It strikes me as being entirely ironic that voting be used in this manner, rather than discussion as /u/catern/ has chosen to do. The same downvoting absolutely illustrates the problem I'm posting about.

        I agree with your understanding in the edit. Almost anything goes in the recommendation thread while the front page should be limited to those works that align more closely with the definitions in the sidebar, as difficult and subjective that may be

        I don't see much harm in author's being aware that sharing their work whether on the subreddit or in the recommendation thread exposes them to a group that is willing to critique works but I also think that it'd be quite difficult to implement some sort of warning

        Is it up to author's to tell their readers not to share their works with communities that might come across as mean or up to those communities to tell its members to only share works when they're sure the author is okay with criticism? Whatever the answer is I see no practical solution

        > If you're not part of this community, I don't think you should be posting here.Â

        ```

        - u/RMcD94:
          ```
          Considering that the community hardly agrees with the definition then the only way to get a feel for what rational is, is by the consensus of consumption which requires at least passive participation on the subreddit. 

          I'm not seeing much benefit to author's posting here just cause they saw the subreddit name and realised it was a place to harvest readers and advertise. 

          If it's good members of this community will share it, either posting it if they're confident in its rationality or in the recommendation thread which no one expects to be full of rational gemstones and yet is still the most active thread on this subreddit

          Edit:. Minor edits to improve readability

  I think this is a fair caution, and not something I would have thought of if I hadn't gotten the author perspective.  There's risk involved in bringing a lot of critical attention to something, and this sub explicitly prides itself for being exclusive and critical.   It's a reasonable warning to people to think twice before posting a new fic here.
  ```

- u/eaglejarl:
  ```
  As one point on the graph, I'll note that a rec on this sub is what brought *The Two Year Emperor* out of complete obscurity. Had it continued to languish, would I have continued writing and publishing? Perhaps, maybe even probably. Still, I might not have and I'm sure there are others who would get discouraged at echoing silence and change to some other hobby.

  tl;dr There's a chance that this sub is the only reason for the existence of 2YE, Team Anko, Squiring the Phoenix, The Tinker's Daughter, The Change Storms, The Patchwork Realms, Marked for Death, and a bunch of other fiction that's been moderately popular here.
  ```

- u/MarkArrows:
  ```
  Yes and no.

  I think rat-readers are more *outspoken* readers. The normal readers read and then move on with their lives. Rat-readers are more likely to engage with the story and other readers. Among that demographic, it's always going to be outweighed by the people who have a bone to pick vs the ones who don't.

  So yes, you're going to get more negative reviews. I posted my story up, and the first few comments were negative. While that sucks to read, it's not the end of the world either. Some of it was useful feedback, and I implemented it happily because I saw value in that.

  On the other hand, my fic gained a steady 20-30 readers whereas on Royal Road, the type of story I had written would not have gained any traction on recently updated (The demographics on recently updated **heavily** favor cultivation, gamelit, or isekai.)

  Currently my fic is now #5 on trending. I don't think it would have eeked out into the #50 at all unless I had posted it up on reddit. I'll post hard data to back up my claim: [https://i.imgur.com/paf2oEo.png](https://i.imgur.com/paf2oEo.png)

  It wasn't a huge boost - (trending overshadows everything) but it was significant enough to overcome the disadvantages I started with - namely being a complete unknown with 0 previous following, and writing the wrong genre.

  Once it hit #50 on trending, now my fic was visible to others who would have actually liked to read it. At that point, it was all up to how good the fic actually was to stay up there. But I don't think I would have eeked onto there without that post on reddit.

          I think that's true of recommendations anywhere. It is impossible to share the gospel of your favorite story without the possibility that people will dislike it. Even if you recommend a thing in private conversations, to people you are sure will like the thing, it remains possible that you will be wrong and they will dislike it and review accordingly.

            You're right - it *is* true anywhere. I'd stress that, based on what I've experienced, the risk here is pretty severe compared to other forums. /r/rational is far more selective (to put it delicately) than every other subreddit I frequent.

      Checking your post history, your last recommendation was pretty blank. Not even a mention that stories are young and short at the time of posting. 

      My advice is to identify and mention major flaws/sacrifices that author allowed. Writing something that helps readers to check if they are in the target audience is good as well. In other words, filter people with negative reviews early.

      Complaining that recommendation brings risks feels like thinking about "traffic and ratings" first, readers second.
      ```

      - u/Brell4Evar:

        Hmm.

        Well, first off, thanks for taking the time to check my post history. It's cool you put that kind of effort in before typing a response.

        So, would you revise my caveat to others looking to make recommendations that they do so with much more thoroughness on this subreddit? That actually seems like pretty workable advice.

        Finally,

        >Complaining that recommendation brings risks feels like thinking about "traffic and ratings" first, readers second.

        My goals here are to share works I enjoy as well as encourage the creation of more works. *Of course* the system isn't of primary importance to me, but it absolutely is strategic to my pursuit of one goal. Loss of rating can be very discouraging to creators, leading to less of the works I enjoy.

  What ratings were given, and how far did the scores drop? 

  People have differing expectations about scores. On RR, some authors act like anything below five stars is a personal attack. Maybe people on this subreddit grade with 3 as an average, and you're interpreting it as a review bomb.

      This is fair.

      /u/NoYouTryAnother \- if you can promise not to pass along the specifics, and to confirm here if you think that I've given you something with substance, I'd be happy to give you details on the latest situation that led me to post here.

    I specifically did not provide details because my intention is to look at the bigger picture rather than start a factional argument with those who gave bad ratings.

  There are many more people reading this subreddit than making recs in it, and it's the former, not the latter, who are responsible for the effect.

  IMO the proper takeaway is: if you don't think a rec belongs here, downvote the post with rec - not the fiction itself.  Don't downvote fiction recommended here just because you don't think it should have been recommended here (assuming the author didn't explicitly write it for this community). Web fiction has a wider audience than this community and it's unfair to judge it on narrow criteria. If the writing isn't deliberately aimed at us, that's knowledge useful to us, not to the general public; it's churlish to publically punish the author for not doing our particular thing. Perhaps something to this effect could be stated in the side bar?

  If it's generally terrible then fair play, of course, but that sort of thing doesn't tend to get recommended here in the first place, by and large.

  If we can't convice the readers to take greater care with downvotes, of course, then I agree with OP - we do need to take much more thought when making recs to avoid punishing unsuspecting authors for no reason. But fewer recs would be a sad thing for me to see - I've come away with many a fun read from here of things that were not, strictly, rational; the community's tastes tend to align along more parameters than that.

  Seems like more of a Royal Road issue than an /r/rational issue; if Royal Road wasn't set up to force authors to be hypercompetitive about their ratings, the fact that recs here tend to funnel unusually picky readers toward fictions wouldn't be an issue.
  ```

- u/None:

  Regardless of all else, the two things I'd emphasize are qualifying your recs and being aware of risks.

  If you're going to make a rec here it should be qualified. You should be able to say "so, this story focused on X and Y, if you don't like those things, you probably won't enjoy it" or "I admit this story has weaknesses in its writing, like A and B, but if you look past those I think you'll enjoy it." Basically, if you want to make a "good" rec here, you should be objective enough to moderate people's expectations. If you make a rec without any qualifiers I will immediately assume you think it doesn't *need* any qualifiers, and if it's not good enough for that to be true, I will be disappointed.

  As other people have said, I think each author can make the cost/benefit analysis for themselves. Yes, if you post a rec here, you will attract some degree of negative attention, which may very well outweigh the positive attention. But different people will feel differently about how much of a risk that is, or how worth it it is. So I wouldn't make a general de-rec of posting recs here, I'd just say "be informed about what you're doing."

  Basically, inform people and be informed yourself. Easy.

  Write something good then? Are authors entitled to a WTC rating if they aren't writing something as good as WTC?
  ```

  - u/Brell4Evar:
    ```
    My reason for posting above is not to lash out at anyone rating a story as they see fit. Please take it as a caveat for those sharing stories they enjoy that want to avoid an author taking a hit in ratings or negative reviews.

    The bulleted advice at the bottom of my post is what I'm hoping people take away from this - especially the final point. 

    As an example, if someone recommends a cultivation story with a warning that it's a cultivation story, readers who dislike cultivation stories are less likely to click the link and downvote because it's a category they consider bad.

    By popular novel standards, WTC has quite the low rating on RR. There is a disconnect between what the readers on this subreddit consider good as opposed to the preferences of the general populace roaming RR (and understandably so). 

    I don't write my fiction to be rational in the way this subreddit enjoys, so whenever my work was recommended here, my ratings took a dive. A lot of my writer friends experienced the sameâ€”many of whom are the cream of the crop when it comes to producing free fiction for the internet. In some (not always light-hearted) ways, the reader-base of this subreddit has become a meme amongst us. 

    But that's not to say you guys aren't awesome. Personally, I appreciate all the feedback I get, and even if it isn't all praise, I have received a lot of kind words from r/rational.

  What's the purposes of stories even having an option to rate it negatively or review badly?

  Couldn't and shouldn't authors post stories exclusively on sites that only allow positive feedback?
  ```

  - u/Brell4Evar:
    ```
    So, here's my weird answer.

    I'm actually not raging about people who pop over to RR and provide low stars or negative reviews. I considered and discarded that idea when I wrote the original post, above.

    What I was searching for was a way forward to sharing what we enjoy without encountering a scenario I've seen happen more than a few times, now.

    Let's look at the following:

    * An author creates a harem fantasy piece - a werewolf litRPG that somehow ends up tone deaf on Judaism, gender, abledness, and race. Still, RR readers enjoy the cover art and the combat sequences, and it scores a solid 3.9.
    * A separate author writes something some people here would enjoy, but a handful of unspecified others would **hate**. It has some good reviews and a starting rating of 4.5.

    I think it's reasonable to expect a storm of negative reviews and downvotes for the second example, while the first probably wouldn't see the light of day here - and thus avoid the righteous wrath of every single reader here.

    When I originally posted, I didn't see a way to avoid wrecking the poor person writing that second story. I still won't condemn someone for writing a bad review. That's just me whining about someone else doing something they think is right.

    At the same time, I recognize that I could have prevented an author whose work I enjoy from getting a metaphorical gut punch. I think it's a good talk to have. I can see a win both for those who enjoy some works as well as those who don't - if we're a bit more careful.
    ```
