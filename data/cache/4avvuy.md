## Fine Structure: Chronological Cut

### Post:

Sam has [posted](http://qntm.org/chronological) a listing of the chapters of Fine Structure in chronological order. I can't comment much without a re-read, but it seems to be an interesting way to read the story.

He also mentioned an ongoing "end-to-end rewrite of the story," which I'm *very* excited about.

  I haven't reread *Fine Structure* in far too long, but it stands as maybe one of the most enjoyable things I ever remember reading. (Maybe because I happened to read it alongside the Sequences, but I digress.) Very much looking forward to this edit!

  And hell, maybe this has motivated me to finish Ra tonight. It's only 11:50, and school starts at 7:30 tomorrow â€¦ I have time.

  I tried reading fine structure a few years ago just after finishing RA but I was sort of put off by all the jumping around in the timeline.
  Now with the chronological order things make a lot more sense and it's actually enjoyable

  I'm (slightly) annoyed that Sam makes posts that he doesn't put on his RSS. Thanks for the update!

    Oh, it's up on the RSS now.
