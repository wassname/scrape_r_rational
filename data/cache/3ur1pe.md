  This reminded me of qntm's antimemetics entries. It has physical form, but could be classified as antimemetic nonetheless. Very cool! I feel nervous just writing about it.

  The rationalists in this story, of course, are the authors who carefully found a way to document and warn about this uncontained SCP without killing themselves.

    Memes can be held in artifacts as well as minds.

      It's possible it reacts to a sentient mind's processing of visual information, and that processing of self-contained graphics (one graphic image per concept) is different from processing of text (where a series of non-overlapping images/letters in a very particular order make up the concept).

      That being the case, presumably languages with 'letters' originally derived from images, such as characters in a number of Asian languages and things like hieroglyphics, would produce the same results as English, as they require a number of characters next to each other to form a sequence associated with a concept not implicit in the individual characters.

      However, communication systems such as cave paintings should be able to describe ●●|●●●●●|●●|● without evoking it.

      It's worth noting that minds _can_ be considered fundamental in the SCP-verse.   Coincidentally, this from the point of view of [another](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5389450/1/The-Finale-of-the-Ultimate-Meta-Mega-Crossover) piece of Yudkowski fanfic:

      _Anyway, Maria, the logic of the events you're describing is one where consciousness has effects that take precedence over the laws of physics - where lower levels of organization give way to higher levels of organization. There are universes where the visible rules are simple, mathematical, and fundamental, and everything that happens, happens within them. And there are universes where the visible rules are complicated and have explicit special cases for surface phenomena - and usually some of the visible rules are about mental phenomena, and don't visibly reduce to rules about non-mental parts. We call the former sort of universe 'natural', and the latter sort 'magical'._

      The SCP-verse definitely qualifies as magical.  (referencing Yudkowski to explain everything seems reasonable, considering that I think this is one of the pieces that he will neither confirm nor deny)

  Very cool.

  What does X(0123) O(45) mean? (Just below the do not write on paper, on a computer or talk)

    That's clearance level for the document. Security clearance 0-3 are not allowed to look at the document, while clearance level 4 and 5 (or O5) are. [See here](http://www.scp-wiki.net/security-clearance-levels-arc) for more on SCP security clearance levels.

      Yeah this is actually kinda a bad introduction to SCP Wiki since this article requires you be pretty familiar with an SCP entry, now that I think about it. [SCP-140](http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-140) may be a better introduction, or [SCP-2602, which used to be a library](http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2602).

          I mostly just follow links and look at random SCPs. A couple favorites:

          [SCP-1025](http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1025)
          [SCP-682](http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-682)
          [SCP-2317](http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2317)
          [SCP-914](http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-914)
          ```

  ```
  Why would ●●|●●●●●|●●|● take the human that was speaking about it and not the human that was writing about it?
  ```

  - u/blazinghand:
    ```
    It might not be able to distinguish humans from pencils/papers. It probably just understands the words, and things that generate them proximally.

    ●●|●●●●●|●●|● looks like it basically takes anything that it understands as knowing about it, or containing information about it. When a human speaks, it seizes the human, but when a human writes, maybe it recognizes the pencil and paper as the "speaker" and doesn't make the connection that the human is involved somehow. This is in the same sense that it doesn't seize the sound system that said to the human, "start writing"-- this kind of stuff is not comprehensible to it.

      It seems to basically be Candlejack.
      ```

      - u/Transfuturist:
        ```
        Oh my god, it *is* Candlej
        ```

        - u/ZeroNihilist:
          ```
          Good guy Candlejack, presses "save" aft
          ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    The paper displays the information. The paper is taken.

    The human displays the information. The human is taken.
