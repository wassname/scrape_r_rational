## [BST][D] Romance in Rational Fiction discussion for Valentine's Day!

### Post:

I posed this question [last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/1xu1zn/d_romance_in_rationalist_fiction/?) and it went well.

Has anything changed since then? Have great works of the rationalist canon incorporated or focused on romance? Has the outside world media gotten any better at handling romance? Have you?

  "Marry me"

  "Are you serious?"

  "We're genetically compatible, highly intelligent and have the same goals. It makes perfect sense to get married"

  -[David Xanatos proposal, Gargoyles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzu3IT590h4)

  I'd love to read a rational Gargoyles fic with Xanatos as main protagonist. He and Fox make a scarily logical based couple (can't say rational as they're not precisely a healthy relationship). Another great example comes when Xanatos decides to use Fox as guinea pig for a magical talisman and yet in the end shows he loves her too much to lose her.

  They have great chemistry, are somewhat sociopaths willing to manipulate the other yet in the end they stay together and are willing to grow together and compromise some of their inherent selfishness.

  So far the only rational fics I've seen that have romance in them are:

  Luminosity/Radiance
  Strong Female Protagonist

  Not sure if Time Braid counts as rational fic.

  I don't think I've seen any on screen romantic relationships anywhere else in rational fiction.

  It's kinda refreshing to take a break from the culturally omnipresent over-the-top obsession with romance, but I think rational fiction could do a good job of presenting realistic and healthy romantic relationships where a lot of typical romance fiction doesn't. I.e. in the original Twilight, Edward spies on Bella while she's sleeping. In real life, this is called stalking. In Twilight, it's called romantic. You do not see this EVER happen in Luminosity.

    Not sure if Time Braid counts as romance. Power being an aphrodisiac kind of turns everything extremely ~~creepy~~ dubious.

      While it was an aphrodisiac it wasn't shown as the reason they were in the relationship, and it did touch on many topics regarding those relationships and their implications.

      Don't know if i'd really count it as full on "rational" fiction, but it was well written, and i think the author put more effort into the relationships than any other story I read which wasn't first and foremost -about- relationships.

    To expand on that, in *Luminosity*, sometimes he does watch her while she sleeps - but only once they're dating, and once she's agreed.  His sister Alice looked into the future and warned him that doing it any other way would ruin any chance of Rational!Bella ever even being friendly to him.

  /u/Velorien's Rational!Naruto fanfic [Lighting up the Dark](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9311012/1/Lighting-Up-the-Dark) has some romance in it. I don't know how rational the romance is but it seems pretty healthy compared to mainstream media romance stuff at least.

    IIRC, [*The Waves Arisen*](https://wertifloke.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/) had romantic elements as well, and was also a higher quality story in general.
    ```

    ```
    The romance in that is quite puerile, though, if I remember correctly. It does make sense considering the age of the characters, but it's cringy none the less.

  Oh, [Fall of Doc Future](http://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/82363551272/fall-of-doc-future-contents) has a bunch of romance! The sequels as well.

    Gotta toss in an obligatory poly warning here.

    Not to say that polyamory is bad, it's a fascinating concept, but the way it's approached in that series has a rather polarizing effect, as far as I can recall. Most people who devote any interest to it seem to be very hot/cold about it.

  I *still* want a new Pygmalion - part ancient Greek, part Shaw - set in an AI research facility.  Probably cynical with an ending featuring ElizAI going foom in an unfriendly manner.

  At least that's the image that ["Without You"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3mC4485Ue0) brings to *my* mind.

  I think this discussion might open up in significant new directions if the definition here was expanded from merely "great works of the rationalist canon [with a side order of] romance", to the topic of rational romance in general.

  Rather than presupposing (not that I'm accusing you of that, but I'm just pointing out a possible fallacy) that all romance is by definition irrational on some level, we could ask the question: of all the stories that might be considered "romances", how many of them are rational?

  Because then that opens up the space to things like Jane Austen's novels, which are definitely considered romances, and which, I would argue, are refreshingly rational. Unfortunately, most of the stuff that passes for romance in the mainstream media *doesn't* qualify as rational IMO. Way too many of the plots are wholly dependent on characters merely not telling each other some important truth when they first have the opportunity.

  I think I've gotten better at portraying romance in my writing. My *Captain America* fic, [Echoes and Questions](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10305962/1/Echoes-and-Questions), for example, is two canon characters (Steve Rogers and Sharon Carter) sitting down to have a rational conversation about what would be involved in maintaining a romantic relationship with Captain America. There are biological concerns, disparity-of-physical-strength concerns, psychological concerns, emotional concerns... It feels like nobody ever writes about this kind of stuff in the romance genre, and definitely not in the comic-book-superhero genre, so it leaves open vast tracts of land :) in which to write compelling stories.

  And then my four-novel epic *Downton Abbey* rewrite fic, [Trust and Providence](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10078078/1/Trust-and-Providence), does away with two whole series' worth of the TV show's shallow main romance plot by having the two primary characters talk plainly about their terrible secret and then get engaged *in the first chapter*. Which leaves 500K+ words to actually *tell a compelling and intelligent story*. It's a thorough example of how to write a romance where the parties act rationally, almost never hide information from each other, aren't separated by obvious contrivances, and yet still struggle with antagonistic forces that threaten to tear them apart (e.g., infertility, WWI, paraplegia, rape recovery, plain old exhaustion from being parents and trying to run a business and a family simultaneously). As a bonus, it has plenty of explicit sex scenes and not a single one of them is merely gratuitous. Because, you know, compelling drama and sexuality can be intertwined in a long-term marriage!

  I'm working on a rational work where one of the subthemes is romance and loss as it relates to a world that has reincarnation, including some level of memory and emotional remembrance of past lives.

  It's set in [](#s "Exalted"). The main characters are one SI and 4 of the friends he makes, who become [](#s "a Solar circle.") There may be one or two others who technically count as main characters or romantic interests, I haven't decided quite how to square the pentagon on that yet.

  I just thought of an idea for a squicky rational story. How about a researcher in either genetics or robotics that decides that the best way to get companions most fitting to a set of desired parameters is to raise them from scratch in a kind of [Hikaru Genji plot](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WifeHusbandry).

  And have the fic deal with the social and moral ramifications of it. It could tie to the role of service robots in the future and what would a being designed to please its master think of that role, particularly if such a being has consciousness. I'm not sure if that'd be too squicky though...
