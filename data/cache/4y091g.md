## How would you go about actually neutralizing God?

  The holy books are inconsistent enough that "how would we neutralize God as defined in the holy books" is underspecified.  If he's capable of creating the universe in a day, there's probably not much you can do.  If he has to send the angel of death to kill the Egyptians by looking at the marks on the doorposts rather than just waving his hand and having them all instantly die, he's a lot weaker.

    It's either underspecified or it's so clear as to make God almost bland in how powerful it is, so there's nothing worth discussing.

    You're almost better off finding a fictional version of God balanced for a universe to deal with. They might actually have feats and challenges.

  Well by the torah, I'd expect god to be neutralized by his own directives. By the king james bible, I'd expect god to be neutralized by his son basically going "Dad, don't be a dick". By what I understand of islam, I expect god to be neutralized by virtue of being multifaceted enough to see all sides.

  In general this is a case of the invisible dragon in their garage. You can expect god to do nothing measurable or meaningful, where it can be recorded. Accordingly video cameras and regular recordkeeping effectively prevents god from acting in a detectable way. So I'd argue that god is effectively already neutralized.

    Why would  this be the case?

    God in Islam iirc outright stated to[ sending angels to interfere in a tribal conflict for Mohammed](https://quran.com/3/123-129), and angels have shown the ability to disguise themselves almost perfectly to deal with mortals. 

    It's not a being that you can expect to not act.

  God's biggest biblical weakness seems to be a requirement tor intermediaries. God only speaks to specific people, and even then usually indirectly through angels or signs. Direct action by God seems so rare that the few times it happens could very well be explained as elision: God "created" the universe in the same way that Steve Jobs "created" the iPhone.

  God as supervisor rather than pure omnipotence... a functional polytheist pantheon hiding behind a single CEO.

  In that case, convincing various underlings to revolt would be the obvious path to neutralizing God's influence. Indeed the (largely apocryphal - in the classic sense) failed revolution by Lucifer seems to imply such a previous vote of no-confidence.

  I'd also suggest that pushing for boardroom politics would be risky unless we could also guarantee that whomever filled the power vacuum would have our interests better in mind than God did... a tall order whether it's a new CEO, a committee, or some sort of nascent shareholder democracy.

    Reddit has long been a hot spot for conversation on the internet. About 57 million people visit the site every day to chat about topics as varied as makeup, video games and pointers for power washing driveways.

    In recent years, Reddit’s array of chats also have been a free teaching aid for companies like Google, OpenAI and Microsoft. Those companies are using Reddit’s conversations in the development of giant artificial intelligence systems that many in Silicon Valley think are on their way to becoming the tech industry’s next big thing.

    Now Reddit wants to be paid for it. The company said on Tuesday that it planned to begin charging companies for access to its application programming interface, or A.P.I., the method through which outside entities can download and process the social network’s vast selection of person-to-person conversations.

    “The Reddit corpus of data is really valuable,” Steve Huffman, founder and chief executive of Reddit, said in an interview. “But we don’t need to give all of that value to some of the largest companies in the world for free.”

    The move is one of the first significant examples of a social network’s charging for access to the conversations it hosts for the purpose of developing A.I. systems like ChatGPT, OpenAI’s popular program. Those new A.I. systems could one day lead to big businesses, but they aren’t likely to help companies like Reddit very much. In fact, they could be used to create competitors — automated duplicates to Reddit’s conversations.

    Reddit is also acting as it prepares for a possible initial public offering on Wall Street this year. The company, which was founded in 2005, makes most of its money through advertising and e-commerce transactions on its platform. Reddit said it was still ironing out the details of what it would charge for A.P.I. access and would announce prices in the coming weeks.

    Reddit’s conversation forums have become valuable commodities as large language models, or L.L.M.s, have become an essential part of creating new A.I. technology.

    L.L.M.s are essentially sophisticated algorithms developed by companies like Google and OpenAI, which is a close partner of Microsoft. To the algorithms, the Reddit conversations are data, and they are among the vast pool of material being fed into the L.L.M.s. to develop them.

      Specifically *not* Satan. The two times he shows up in the bible - Job's first chapters and Jesus' temptation in the wilderness - he comes across as a loyal and effective employee. He thinks outside the box, but he never does anything God doesn't ask him to do.

      Like I say, the Lucifer rebellion is (with the exception of one of the Pauline letters) only in the Apocrypha rather than the bible proper... and even there he's got nothing to do with Satan.

      Ah right yeah. Of course. To neutralise God, back his strongest opponent. It's obvious now that you say it.
