  I get the feeling Norberg was the driving force behind the original Iron Lantern Project. Going to admit, I keep hoping to see 'delphic' mention that he's extracting all of his assets from the country and leaving, moving to some other part of the world, and it's all because the Norburg's won't leave him to be an American. Or something. Incredibly petty, but becomes more and more rational with every new exposure to Harmony.

  Kelda's whispered plea(?) to Delphic not to judge Harmony would probably piss me off. Kelda maybe doesn't know it, but Harmony is functionally trying to kidnap Delphic, which goes way beyond "well intentioned, but misguided".

  Hector seems to be willing to treat it as almost playful back and forth, wanting to frustrate Harmony until she can see that he's one of the good guys, but everything we learn about her seems to suggest that she embodies the desire for control/security that Delphic is flatly incompatible with so long as he's not firmly under her thumb.

  Is this Analyst the one with the super-speed powers?

    No, she is working with the doc.
