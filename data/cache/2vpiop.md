  Edits have been made to earlier chapters too. If someone could make a discussion thread on lesswrong now that it's done, and a tvtropes page so that it won't vanish once it falls off the front page of reddit, I'd appreciate it. Hope you enjoyed reading.

    Well I haven't read it yet, but my routine since you started posting has been a beer and a chapter and im quite excited for four. It was a good story,  I really enjoyed it

    Best Naruto fic I've read yet. And complete! <3 Thank you!
    ```

  - u/Jello_Raptor:

    I loved it. Thank you for writing it. 

    I hope you'll find writing more and sharing it with us is a net positive towards your utility function.

    Just spelling/grammar corrections, or anything substantive?

  The Shadow Council using Pein's own mind reading against him was hilarious and awesome.  I can respect Naruto decision to hold off on the unlimited resurrections until he had gotten things under control, but it seems like he should at least resurrect useful allies like Kakashi or historically trustworthy people like the First Hokage to help him.

  I like how Pein's plans seemed shallow/hollow compared to the way Naruto thought things out.  He didn't really have any ideas that would make peace last more than a generation.  

  Also, I like this part so much I just want to requote it:

  > “Maybe not, but you’ve reminded me of something important—something I think I might have forgotten lately, with all this focus on getting stronger… It’s not enough to be strong, even if you do need a lot of strength to get anything done. You’ve still got to figure out what should actually be done, and whoever ends up with the power to fix things is going to have to deal with a lot of big questions, because we don’t understand even a fraction of what the ancients knew, yet, and I don’t think I can trust you to navigate a situation that requires regularly acknowledging your own ignorance. Maybe I am just being stubborn, but I make a thousand mistakes before breakfast every morning, and I’ve hurt too many people with my own stupid decisions to ever think very highly of my stupid little thoughts. I’m terrified that I’ll screw up once I start changing things, and if you’re not, then that’s a weakness I can’t accept in a leader. So I’ll just have to beat you and do it myself.”

  Excellent synthesis of Shounen determinator tropes with Rationalist fiction tropes.

  Can we just talk about stars for a minute? What is UP with those guys?

  And fucking MAGNETS! How do they work?
  ```

- u/AmeteurOpinions:
  ```
  *applause*

  That was basically perfect. One question, though: what does "Panasoniku" mean?
  ```

  - u/blockbaven:
    ```
    Naruto took the name written on the Hyuuga's "ancient artifact" (a broken Panasonic television) as his nom de conqueror
    ```

    - u/AmeteurOpinions:
      ```
      Ah. Even more perfect.
      ```

- u/InternetWanderer:
  ```
  >They’d considered faking an invasion from outside at first—uniting the villages behind him against a common foe, but Hinata thought that that kind of unity was unlikely to persist once the threat faded away, and there was always the risk of exposure. 

  Not impressed by Alan Moores Watchmen, I take it.

  I was kinda surprised that Naruto didn't resurrect anyone. I agree with his statement about not doing mass resurrections, but none at all is a little surprising. Maybe just Jiraiya? They were trying to rescue him anyways.

  Oh, and this fic was amazing. Well done!
  ```

  - u/gabbalis:
    ```
    Oh I'm sure he'll get around to it eventually...

    Now I want a second epilogue in the year 32,645 of the Reign of the Undying Emperor, with all of our favorite characters getting culture shock and reacting to Naruto's new position...

    Kinda like the epilogue flashes after Luminosity and Radiance...
    ```

    - u/Transfuturist:
      ```
      Hmmm, tens of millennia... An undying Emperor... A space program...

      In the grim darkness of the future...
      ```

  - u/derefr:
    ```
    He didn't resurrect anyone *yet*. Respectable to take a bit of time to decide on at least a tentative policy for it before going about it.
    ```

- u/blockbaven:
  ```
  The ultimate drill technique gave me heavy Gurren Lagann vibes.
  ```

  - u/scruiser:
    ```
    The Shounen speech contributed to giving me the Gurren Lagann feel also.
    ```

- u/eaglejarl:
  ```
  I enjoyed this a lot. 

  My only objection was Hinata -- she stayed a plot device the whole time, with no character development and no power ups. Nothing would have changed in the story if she had been completely removed and Naruto had gotten his Byakugan by killing some random Hyuuga and then had Sasuke give Naruto the rinnegan at the end. (Sasuke had enough medical ninjutsu to do eye transplants, after all.)
  ```

  - u/JackStargazer:
    ```
    Same objection. Sasuke to a lesser extent had the same issue, but Hinata was purely 1 dimensional. We didn't even get to see her reaction after having annihilated Neji in what would have otherwise been a character defining moment. Just seems like a lost opportunity.
    ```

  - u/rumblestiltsken:
    ```
    I guess you could say it parallels canon. Just changes hair colour and brings Naruto a free power up to the table.

    Apparently rational!Naruto includes women being even more unimportant, other than providing (part of) their bodies to men.

    I enjoyed it a lot too, but god damn thats some bad gender themes.
    ```

    - u/Shurane:
      ```
      That's most of the female ninja besides Tsunade, though.
      ```

  - u/AugSphere:
    ```
    > no power ups

    I think mastering the healing under Tsunade is a pretty big achievement and reflects her level of talent fairly well. If you took away the ridiculous power-multipliers of Naruto and Sasuke, she'd probably kick their asses at that point. It's thematically fitting that she's had the most progress out of all three teammates and is the weakest. The universe (in this fic) does not grade on a curve and unfair advantages pretty much decide everything.
    ```

    - u/eaglejarl:
      ```
      Did she use the healing, aside from dumping her healing diamond into Naruto after opening his gates?  She may have, but I'm not remembering an occasion.

      Don't get me wrong, Hinata is one of my favorite characters in Naruto-verse.  I just wish she'd had more screen time.
      ```

- u/FeepingCreature:
  ```
  Oh god I love you. Various happy fan noises.
  ```

- u/Kodix:
  ```
  Nagato's actions/beliefs were quite in line with what I would expect of him from canon, while also fitting the fic perfectly. Well done.

  Really, my main issue with the story is what has already been said - it needs more filler, amusing as that sounds. 

  It was still very, very good. Thank you for this, Wertifloke.
  ```

- u/Adamantium9001:
  ```
  Well. That...was a thing that happened.

  My main criticism was that you clearly cut corners in order to bring the story to a close within X number of words, rather than allowing it to play out at its natural speed. One chapter power-levelling and then *surprise*, final boss? You can't *possibly* think there won't be people who will find that incredibly unsatisfying. Other than that, great!

  Edit: my most-mourned casualty of the above is the fact that the stuff *this* is referring to happened off-screen: [](#s "'Hinata had told him earlier that she had something she’d been meaning to say for a while, and she wanted to tell him once he was finished doing his warlord stuff.'")
  ```

  - u/rumblestiltsken:
    ```
    I think part of the point was showing that FOOM isn't really narratively satisfying at human speed. Naruto done foomed.

    I also would have liked a bit more middle, but it worked.
    ```

    - u/Nevereatcars:
      ```
      Is FOOM an onomatopoeia or an acronym?
      ```

      - u/Aretii:
        ```
        Onomatopoeia. It's the sound of recursive self-improvement, generally found in the context of an AI intelligence explosion.
        ```

        - u/FeepingCreature:
          ```
          You're looking at your AI program! It's just managed to understand how its own program works. So adorable. Carefully, it does a few small performance changes, then starts its replacement program. The replacement program has a bright idea! It spreads itself to the unused computers in your office. You start to worry a little. It starts its replacement program. Thereplacementprogramhasabrightidea--FOOM.
          ```

  - u/scruiser:
    ```
    I wasn't sure I agreed with you until you added the part about Hinata.  I think Hinata and Sasuke could have used some more interaction with Naruto and exploration of there character development before the story ended.

  I soundly enjoyed this entire series. I found it well-written, aggressively paced, and enthralling. I liked that it didn't dick around and pushed the plot and exposition forward quickly. I liked that it dealt with the ninja society and I liked the worldbuilding. The villains and heroes were good. Overall, this is my favorite Naruto story, canon and non-canon. 

  Thank you for writing and publishing this story. You did well.

  Just now starting to read chapter 19. Not going to be reading much of the thread yet, to avoid spoilering myself, but I _HAD_ to comment on one thing right away:

  > Anything was possible with a zombie com—

  ... OWWWWWWW, I see what you did there, wow. Heee. That was gloriously horrible.
  ```

  - u/pedanterrific:
    ```
    I didn't get that reference, and google isn't turning up anything. Spoil it?

        OOOOH. Thank you for explaining that. Maaan it's been a while since I was there.
        ```

- u/mns2:
  ```
  Will you be posting the story on fanfiction.net, too?
  ```

- u/None:
  ```
  Did...did he actually use Timeless Decision Theory to defeat Pein?
  ```

- u/chaosmosis:
  ```
  No offense, but I would have preferred if you didn't include the epilogue. It was underwhelming, and Naruto's threats felt too overblown and childish. It felt silly, when the previous chapter had just left me feeling in awe (with just the right small amount of humor at its end).

  I liked Hinata's genre savvy choice to not tell Naruto she loved him.
  ```

  - u/derefr:
    ```
    You know the kinds of horrible misunderstandings Ami has in Dungeon Keeper Ami? Most of them are because being nice, considerate, gentle, humble, or shy signals *all the wrong things* and only *makes life harder for you* when you're trying to conquer a world for its own good.

    You can be a gracious emperor, or a respectful emperor, or even a noble and honorable emperor, but you can't be a *good* emperor. Nobody bows to a *good* emperor.
    ```

    - u/chaosmosis:
      ```
      In that case, I think Naruto should have actually killed someone (who is sufficiently immoral or likely to resist, perhaps, although he also could have resurrected them instead afterwards). He didn't sound like a strong emperor, he sounded like an emperor who doesn't understand how important strength actually is except in a vague abstract way.
      ```

  - u/Transfuturist:
    ```
    Embrace the silliness. The revolution will not be self-censored.
    ```

  - u/chaosmosis:
    ```
    Perhaps less subjectively, I feel like the implication of "the same thing we're going to do every night, Sasuke" is that Naruto will continue to have difficulties and challenges in the utilitarian pursuit of his goals, while the implication of the epilogue is that Naruto, through overwhelming strength, will soon rule everything and cause everyone to live happily ever after. I find the first implication more satisfying for epicurean reasons and also because it is more compatible with the idea expressed earlier that simply having strength is not enough and one must also figure out the troubling logistical details to be a good person.
    ```

- u/kaukamieli:
  ```
  Bwahaha. :D Just managed to read the chapter 19. Shadow council rocks! Thank you Wertifloke! I still have four more chapters to read while I'm on a train. :)
  ```

- u/Kuratius:
  ```
  So what actually happened to the Sannin?
  ```

  - u/Jace_MacLeod:
    ```
    Dead, likely killed while resting by Pein. It wasn't mentioned in the story, but the rain falling in the city was a giant surveillance technique, so ambushing them after they arrived - tired from travel - would have been simple.
    ```

- u/philip1201:
  ```
  I'm not sure if I understand the mechanics of the shield technique - are spheres allowed to intersect or not? If they don't intersect, breaking three shields per second, each maintained by a different person standing 0.5 meters apart would result in 1.5 m/s of physical movement. I'm not sure if that's taken properly into account in all cases.

  If they are allowed to overlap, then should it even matter that they can only surround Naruto? Couldn't you trap and squish most of the Peins by trapping them in partially overlapping barriers?
  ```

- u/logrusmage:
  ```
  That was amazing.
  ```

- u/ToaKraka:
  ```
  To me, this story felt less like *Time Braid* than like *Vulpine*--a light-hearted, recklessly-rushing, only-*semi*-awesome homage to *undiluted* awesomeness, rather than undiluted awesomeness in its own right. Maybe it's just because so many of Naruto's super-smart schemes went over my head. (shrugs) Still--any amount of awesomeness in a story is appreciated!
  ```

  - u/Transfuturist:
    ```
    This story was undeniably undiluted awesomeness. I would say it's much better than Time Braid, if simply for not suffering from typical fanfiction tropes. Not that Time Braid isn't itself awesome, this story is just better.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      Eh, I disagree. While this fic was totally awesome, it was a bit too compressed and rushed to match the depth and breadth of Time Braid. IMO.
      ```
