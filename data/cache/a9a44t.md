## [Request] I really love "Build them up" type stories where the ability of a character, or a group, improves throughout the story, like with Mother of Learning. Does anyone have any recommendations of books/web series that fall into this category and also feature rational elements?

### Post:

I'm really stumped here, I've been desperate for more content to read since MoL only updates every 3 or more weeks, and will in fact be coming to an end soon...

I can't figure out what the genre name is for stories where the character/group builds ability throughout? All I know is that I love this type of story, my favourite movies and books are ones where this kind of thing happens throughout. However I'm struggling to find more stories similar in focus to MoL.

It's not necessarily that I'm looking for similar plotlines, it's just I'm after more rational stories that feature a big "build it up" element throughout.

Anyone have some suggestions?

  I can wholeheartedly recommend [The Games we Play](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-games-we-play-rwby-the-gamer-ryuugi-complete.351105/reader). It is exactly what you are looking for, and I thoroughly enjoyed the story, competently written and full of action and training. It's a fan fiction but stands perfectly well on its own, I had never even heard of RWBY and never really felt I was reading a fan fiction.

      It's a 3d animated series set in a world where monsters roam everywhere and humanity has only a few cities. I still haven't watched it, my knowledge of the setting comes from this fic.

        That's basically the extent of worldbuilding in the original show. TGWP is like The Lord of the Rings in comparison -- canon doesn't come even close to the depth and ingenuity of that AU setting. It also helps that the author completely disregarded the canon plotline and basically wrote whatever the heck he wanted.

      You don't need to watch the animated series, but I think it certainly provides nice visuals for when you actually meet specific characters - otherwise descriptions aren't very good IMO.

  Literally every "Gamer"-style fiction, as well as the korean webtoon that started the fad, since the underlying concept is "the main character gains numerically-measured skills that get stronger the more he uses them".

  Sturgeon's Law still applies, tho.

  Also there's the xianxia genre, which is a similar concept with a more oriental slant. Bear in mind that xianxia is the literary equivalent of junk food. Don't expect any deep plots.

  Edit: the spacebattles forum is a good place to find Gamer fiction.

    Thanks for the reply, and yeah, these types of stories usually are focused around "game" like settings... looking into it seems LitRPG is what I'm looking for... although maybe not ones where it's clearly obvious it's a game.

    Thanks for putting a name to this type of story though, I need to go looking about some more.
    ```

    - u/Kuiper:
      ```
      LitRPG comes in a variety of flavors.  Some of them involve a distinct "real world player vs in-game avatar" dichotomy, where the individuals themselves aren't growing stronger (only their avatars are), and those would probably be less appealing to you.

      Reincarnation stories are a subcategory of LitRPG where a person dies and is reborn into a world that follows a linear progression system that is "game-like" in the sense that they are usually leveling up and learning new skills.  You can pretty easily find these on Royal Road if you search for stories that are tagged as both "litrpg" and" reincarnation," which are two of the more popular genre tags on the site, though finding ones that are specifically rational might be a bit more difficult.

      Reincarnation stories are sort of a subset of a more portal fiction-y version of LitRPG where characters from a contemporary earth setting are transported to a fantasy world (a la Narnia), and that fantasy world happens to have an RPG-like progression system where leveling and whatever game-like elements the author fancies are just part of the fantasy setting.  And there are some LitRPG stories that are just pure secondary world fantasy (a character is born as a level 1 elf and that is basically the totality of the setting, no acknowledgment of earth).

      In addition to genre qualifiers based on setting and premise, people also tend to categorize LitRPG as either crunchy or creamy (or alternatively, hard and soft) depending on how detailed the RPG descriptions are; crunchy/hard LitRPG is liberal with things like damage notifications, in-world item descriptions, and other things that make the experience of reading the story feel more like a video game, while soft/creamy LitRPG has fewer of these elements and might just have "leveling up" as a progression system; someone writing "crunchy" LitRPG will probably have something on every single page to remind you that you're reading a litRPG story, while soft litRPG can sometimes read like a "normal" piece of speculative fiction most of the time where the leveling system is mostly in the background to give a quantifiable sense of progression throughout the story (and sometimes provide a basis for comparing characters' relative power levels).
      ```

      - u/die247:
        ```
        Wow thanks for the detailed response, I had no idea about how LitRPG has all these different styles, Royal Road seems like a great place to go and look around though, had no idea that site existed until this thread lol.

    - u/Draddock:
      ```
      I'd recommend [The Cradle series](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30558257-unsouled) by Will Wight. It's basically chinese wuxia, where characters have to meditate to gather a higher maximum power and various ways to express that power. Fairly similar to a LitRPG, but actually good writing.
      ```

    - u/Terkala:
      ```
      There are also "Transport" or other world stories. Stuff like a modern era backpacker being transported to another world with medieval technology and introducing Gunpowder. Or a person being sent to a world with magic and utterly breaking the magic system with modern era concepts (like summoning an imp and giving it precise instructions on how and when to summon another imp, thus making logic gates and simple programs out of magic)

      Lots of Litrpg books are also in the Transport subgenre, but there are a lot of ones that aren't rpg like at all.

      If you're interested in gamer type fics, consider "The Erogamer", which has been recommended on this subreddit several times. It's a quest-type interactive story based around a gamer power based on erotic games instead of RPGs... and it's also a story with a surprising amount of depth and character agency, neither of which are typical in erotic literature, gamer fics, or quest threads.
      ```

        ```
        Thanks. I feel like I've noticed a trend in manwa, where the premise of the story is amazing but the execution, and the development in particular, tend to be quite sloppy.

  Xianxia was mentioned in another comment as a genre that does this, but Xianxia is generally not rational (my heaven defying luck, and the fact that my opponents are all idiots, allows me to prevail against all opposition). The exception to this is Forty Millenniums of Cultivation, which gets recommended on this subreddit a lot, and for very good reason. If you haven't read it yet, you should definitely check it out. As a Xianxia story, it includes many of the standard tropes, including a magic system designed around a large number of discrete power levels, and a main character with special advantages in climbing that ladder... but there are lots of other skilled and lucky geniuses out there, and some of them have different goals than the MC, and those who constitute meaningful opposition are not stupid about their pursuit of those goals.

  It's not terribly rational, but you might like Will Wight's *Cradle* series. It's English-language-original xianxia, avoiding the more off-putting genre tropes (like all the misogyny and rape) and embracing the incredible cheesy scope, where power ranges from "basically a vanilla human" to "casually kill billions."

  Worm (Superherofiction by Wildbow; was completed in 2013) is pretty good and Taylor get's from pretty basic to stupidly powerful by being creative and trying out new applications of her power. You don't even realize just how much of a change there was until you go back and reread the first few chapters.

          Yeah, but they'd have to have read hundreds of thousands of words to get to that part. How could you get that far into *WtC* and expect it to turn into fetish porn? It would be like getting to the end of *The Lord of the Rings* and expecting a sex scene with Sauron. Or it would be like *not* expecting gross sex scenes in the next season of *Game of Thrones.*

            To play devil's advocate here, it wouldn't have been the first time an online author decided to make a sharp departure from the established premise of a story.  It's not exactly *common*, but it's not completely unheard of, either.

            Just as an example, there was one MLP fanfiction I remember following several years ago (I Am Going To Save And/Or Destroy Equestria!) where the protagonist found himself in the body of a very powerful villain and the de facto leader of a bunch of ponies trying to survive and avoid/defeat all the other villains.  It was a good, solid story.

            ...then, about 30 chapters in, the character got blackout drunk and turned every pony into anthros.  That chapter was *very* poorly received.  The chapter was rewritten, but the story stopped updating a chapter or two later.

  If you are into reading epic fantasy or listening to their audiobooks I also recommend the stormlight archive and the king killer chronicles. Lots of personal growth.

  I actually find this thread funny because I am on book 10 on the dresden files and I am about to drop it because I am so use to reading shonen/build them up stories and the dresden files does not have a system like this. Dresden gets stronger after each book but it is mostly off screen or temporary power ups.

  I can recommend The Wheel Of Time series. It's pretty long. All of the characters get turned from the common rubble to shining gems. Each of them is unique and powerful in their own way. In the end, all of their growth contributed in the Last Battle. 

  It's really epic. But started slow.
  ```

  - u/Ozryela:
    ```
    Wheel of Time is very far from rational though. A lot of major decisions are made on the spur of the moment, and the main characters often act very irrational. Expect a lot of angst from all three main characters over their powers and how they really don't want them.

    The series has a few strong points. The magic system is really well thought out, the world building is top tier (Only Tolkien himself is better), and the battle scenes in particular are extremely well done.

    Weak points are that the series is waaay too long. It goes on forever, and gets really boring after a few books. In at least one book the main character isn't even included, and several books are all side plots of side plots that aren't even resolved at the end of the book. It gets really annoying.

    A other weak point is the characterization. Especially the female characters can be pretty flat. Some major characters have basically no more personality then 'Gets angry a lot'.

    Finally the book has a really dualistic worldview regarding men and women. They are seen as fundamentally different, using completely different magic systems, and never ever able to understand each other (this drives most, no, all, of the romance subplots in the books). Don't read these books if that kind of gender essentialism annoys you.

      It's literally a different world. It just might be actually a reality there, so it's not like it's wrong.
      ```

      - u/Ozryela:
        ```
        Well yes gender essentialism is an actual fact within the Wheel of Time universe. The author is not wrong about his own world, of course. But that is precisely why some people might be be turned off by the books.

        &nbsp;

        As a side note, the argument "Its true in the setting of the book, so its not wrong" is deeply flawed.
        ```

          ```
          >As a side note, the argument "Its true in the setting of the book, so its not wrong" is deeply flawed.

          In what sense? That people shouldn't write about imperfect worlds to not cause problems for real world? I'm not sure what sort of wrongness you are talking about.
          ```

          - u/Ozryela:
            ```
            If I write a book where all the black characters are lazy and stupid, and half of them are criminals, then I'm gonna be accused of racism. And I'm pretty sure the argument "Well that just happens to be true in this book. Just a coincidence, cross my heart" is not going to impress anyone. Nor should it.
            ```

            - u/kaukamieli:
              ```
              If you gain any popularity you'll probably be accused of lot of things anyway. Obviously it would be stupid to write exactly what you said. Not necessarily because it would be absolutely morally wrong, but because of the backlash.

              Notice that you didn't really quote my whole argument. It's not like it's just the real world where the only difference is that women suck or something.

              Wheel of time is in a fantasy universe, which was created by a creator god thingy, who divided the magic between men and women. It has a really good in-universe reason for the "gender essentialism".

              In fantasy there are actual evil races, who worship evil gods. Is that racism? Maybe. Is it bad?

              Fantasy doesn't pretend to be real world. Completely different worlds should be allowed to differ from reality.

              IMO these kinds of issues should be saved for other kinds of works.

            - u/None:
              ```
              Your comparison is unfair. The racist stereotypes you mentioned are almost always wrong while there are real measurable behavioral and temperamental differences between the sexes. I find that if I disagree with someone I am better served by discussing what exactly conflicts with my view point instead of using phrases like "deeply flawed" with no explanation. It at least gives me some room if I am wrong.

              - u/Ozryela:
                ```
                Ok, let's trace what happened here. You made an argument that was both irrelevant and incorrect. I explained in my post why it was irrelevant. That on its own was sufficient reason to dismiss your argument.

                Then as an aside I pointed out your argument was also wrong. I put that in an aside to indicate that it was independent from the Wheel of Time discussion. You asked why. I explained by giving an counter-example. I took the simplest, clearest counter-example I could think of. Now you're complaining that the counter example, which was deliberately and explicitly not Wheel of Time related, is not related to Wheel of Time. 

                Your logic is flawed on so many levels I have lost track. 

                And the worst part is that none of this bears the slightest relevance to my original post. Because all I said is that Wheel of Time contains a lot of gender essentialism, so that if you dislike gender essentialism it might not be the book for you. Whether gender essentialism is correct or justified or right or wrong is all utterly irrelevant to that point.

  Sorry I am on mobile so I cant link anything but I have plenty. I am really into self insert fanfiction and I prefer the fanfics to be the type your looking for. All self inserts have omniscient knowledge of the universe/timeline that they were reincarnated/transmigrated into so they have the ability to know certain routes to obtain the most amount of power the fastest. They easily have the "weak to strong" vibe you are looking for. 

  The problem with self insert fanfictions is that most of them are extremely irrational focusing on building harems, wish fulfilment, crack, and trolling canon characters. They also obtain power ridiculously easily,even with the godlike knowledge they possess. Its like they are treating their new life as a fun adventure playground and a well written self insert is all about how realistically you can make your SI's life to be.

  Enough of my ranting. Here are the self inserts that I reccommend that tries to be realistic.

  Naruto

  Kaleidoscope. It is a self insert about a man reincarnating into the Uchiha clan in the timeline 2 years before naruto was born. He knows the Uchiha massacre is coming for him and he does everything he can to prepare for it. It has a very rational outcome but be warned because some people might find it offputting of all the 'agnst' coming from the SI. I thought bothing of it because I felt the agnst was him just thinking rationally. 2nd book has alot of stuff that I tend to avoid of self inserts but judging of how good the first book is I let it pass. Complete.

  Sanitize. It is about a girl that was reincarnated into the warring era clans period before formal villages was formed. The self insert has no knowledge of naruto but she was a modern medical practitioner before she was reincarnated. She doesn't get stronger after every chapter but more smarter and accumulated to the grimdark world of ninja. It is ongoing with an extremely slow update rate.

  Walk on moon, son of gato, settling hot water, what doesn't kill you.

  Dc universe-with this ring

  Harry potter-Magical me

  Weak to strong web serials- Wandering inn, Savage divinity(have issues with fluctuating writing quality and its shameless harem)

  Stranded in fantasy is a greentext novel that I highly recommend.

  I highly recommend [Forge of Destiny](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/forge-of-destiny-xianxia-quest.35583/). It's a xianxia quest and has some of the normal non-rationalist problems, but all the characters are well fleshed out and have their own goals and stats/skills. There's a lot of character growth and worldbuilding.

  There's also [Ignition](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/ignition-mtg-multicross-planeswalker-pc.26099/). It's an MTG planeswalker multi-crossover quest and is extremely long, with the main character going through different settings getting stronger. It's...ok, and has quite a bit of nothing happening or steamrolling or being generally unsatisfying, but I'd still probably recommend it to people simply because there's so much of it and it's entertaining and ability-grow-y.

  I'd also recommend [Now You Feel Like Number None](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/now-you-feel-like-number-none-bleach-arrancar-quest.37531/) because it's very well written, although it assumes a lot of Bleach knowledge, but nothing that you can't quickly Google what a term means I think. There's also [A Destiny Of Strife](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/a-destiny-of-strife-a-hollows-quest-bleach.29076/), which is worse but very long and more "Build em up".

  Other people have recommended With This Ring. It's exactly what you want. It's several million words long by now and the author updates it with another 1k words a day every single day. A rationalist munchkiner is dropped into the DC universe with a Green Lantern-esque power ring, and gradually builds up power.

  Quests in general are good for this, because they're long running and tend to accumulate power as they go on, with the QM matching up against steadily increasingly difficult challenges with the chance of failure and (usually) low authorial fiat due to concrete stats and character sheets.

  This is definitely an odd recommendation, but I really liked Polyhistor Academy.

Give it a try for the first few pages and see if it's something you enjoy.
