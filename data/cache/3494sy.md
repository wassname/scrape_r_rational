## [D][WIP] Explaining Multiple History Time Travel

### Post:

Taken directly from qntm's [Modelling Time Travel in Fiction](http://qntm.org/models#sec4):

* You can go back in time whenever you like.
* Every time you go back in time, you create an entirely new timeline.
* If you go forwards in time, you stay in your current timeline.

I wanted to write a book that follows this model and takes it to its extremes. But [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/33qx3k/dbst_society_has_access_to_terminatorstyle_time/) sort of makes me doubt my ability to get the concept across in short order so that the *real* plot can begin.

The general problem here is an exposition one. I don't want to infodump, because I think that's terrible writing. I can't really use Naive Newcomer, because everything that the newcomer would be introduced to is common knowledge to *everyone*, unless the newcomer was something incredibly contrived.

So let's say that you are trying to explain this model of time travel to someone, in the form of a story. What's the best way to get the rules and most of their implications out there and established so that the plot can begin?

(For what it's worth, [this](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15p4mABUBMu1Hp56dCHk4bSUwfOFGlJ3kI1x92JcqkNU/edit?usp=sharing) is my first scene in *The Murder That Wasn't*, which I think needs work in clearly establishing the rules.)

  Why try and explain the rules?
  why not just tell the story from whichever perspective you choose, and let people figure it out themselves?
  i mean by the end of the book they will have a set of observations which would either show the rules you predefined or they would match other possible rules, but that won't matter too much and i can't really see how that would hurt, unless your are trying to write a rationalist story and want people to be able to join in from the start, as opposed to after a while when they will have sufficient observations to be expected to have figured the rules out already..

    The two primary reasons that anyone stops reading something is that they're bored or confused. The worry about not making any attempt to accommodate is that they'll get confused and stop reading before they get to the point where they think everything is going to make sense. It's my personal opinion that you never start with the audience's trust or interest, and if you just assume that people will figure out all the stuff that you've decided on (even if you make sure that there's only one valid interpretation) you risk alienating a huge amount of people.

    So I do think that having the audience pick things up as they go along is valid, but you have to be careful about how you do it, so that they don't realize that they're being fed information. The question is keep them from getting confused without interfering with proper storytelling.
    ```

    - u/callmebrotherg:
      ```
      Hm. Do you never start with the audience's trust even if you've developed a previous reputation? 

      For example, if I were to read Charlie Anon's story and get confused, I might set it down. But if I were reading a story from *you* and I got confused, then I would keep going because you've established a reputation with me for well-crafted stories and worlds, so I'm going to keep going with this. 

      Are you meaning something else when you talk about how an author never starts with the audience's trust or interest? If not, this just might be a story that is for, ah, the veteran Waleswatcher (as we might call those of us who are always on the lookout for a new story from your corner).
      ```

        Well, I think part of gaining trust is leaning on that trust as little as possible. You trust someone to pay you back a lot more if you know they're the sort of person who doesn't borrow money lightly. It's also sort of a gradient. Even a master craftsman of genre fiction like Charles Stross can't depend entirely on the goodwill that he's built up, which means that I'm far, far away from that.

        Maybe what I mean is that you should always behave as though you don't have trust or interest.

        As for having something just for this sub, which has a much higher than average tolerance for weird scifi ideas and stories that have to be puzzled over ... I'll give it some thought. My big (perhaps overly) ambitious plan was to have a loose cycle of time travel books that cover all of the basic models. *Timewise Tales* is in rough draft right now, and uses static model time travel, and the plan was to have *The Murder That Wasn't* as the branching model novel (and a third ripple model novel to round out the series). But if I can figure out a way to do a novella instead, maybe I'll go that way.

      There's a fine line between "confused" and "intrigued".
      ```

      ```
      If you hit people over the head with your backstory, you'll alienate a lot of people too. The trick is to achieve a balance, and for SF&F readers (your target market) who have become accustomed to and expect stories to have twists in them, the balance swings pretty strongly away from exposition.

      At first, while scrolling through responses, I wanted to post pretty much exactly what IomKg said. Then while reading that post, I wanted to reply with "This". Now I am left unfulfilled, and must resort to more verbose methods to accentuate the content of the parent post.

  You got it across in 3 dot points, I doubt infodump is going to be much of a problem. You could probably get most of it across through terminology such as branching. There's also the point that when people other than the protagonist time travel then they vanish and the current timeline stays the same. You could also have it explained in a monologue where the character is planning the jumps they need to do.

  It seems strange that travelling to the future doesn't split the timelines like it does going back.

  The time-travel system should probably open a short-term two way portal, that helps distinguish multiple timelines from other forms of travel
  ```

- u/noggin-scratcher:
  ```
  I'm curious about your plan to overcome some of the narrative challenges of that model of time travel - seems like it makes it difficult to put together coherent character motivations when their time-travelling actions can never help the people they care about in their original timeline. 

  You *can* change stuff as a way to help out the inhabitants of your new branch of the timeline, but butterfly effects are liable to mean that the resulting world is changed sufficiently that you don't find exactly parallel copies of anyone you knew before. Further, to anyone who doesn't travel alongside you, you've just disappeared - exited the universe, never to return, and they can't even "come after you" because when *they* jump back, they'd end up segregated off in their own branch of the timeline.

  Unless your main characters are very careful and coordinated about always time-travelling as a group, it seems like a rather efficient way to permanently separate and scatter them into their own individual timelines, which makes any kind of traditional story *tricky* at best. Not saying that there's no possible story to be told despite those difficulties but as I started out saying at the top, I'm curious what your plan is.

    Now you're narrating the plot of Charlie Stross's *Palimpsest*.
    ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    The very first attempt at writing this book came about four years ago, and most of those narrative challenges didn't exist, because no one actually time traveled (with only a few exceptions). I believe the primary plots were:

    * A small group of weeaboos is in training to go back to Edo Japan as part of the homebrew retroactive colonization movement (leaving behind everyone they knew in life)
    * A college-age girl gets a letter from her future husband telling her to seek him out (sending something like that back is a common anniversary tradition)
    * A detective is closing cases before they happen
    * A long-form reporter who was fired from his job because of poor expected future returns tries to infiltrate the company responsible for time travel
    * Someone makes an assault on Chicago through time travel

    There might have been some others. It was kind of a mess. But the point wasn't to have people traveling through time wily-nily, it was to show a modern society where time travel was a reality - immigration to the past, emigration from the future, rapid technological progress and massive social upheaval.

    Time travel laid out some of the challenges to characters, and sometimes cut branches of possibility, but time traveling backwards into the past creates duplicates if you don't go far enough, and abandons the world that you once knew, which all the characters took seriously.

    Obviously if/when I write this story again I'll be paring it down - there's not really a need to have eight or nine viewpoint characters who all have their own intersecting plots - but the point is mostly to use future information, and have the plot follow a single one of the repeatedly forking timelines.
    ```

    - u/noggin-scratcher:
      ```
      That makes sense, I hadn't really considered the angle of the 'viewpoint' universe being the one that receives various arrivals from the future, rather than following an individual or group using time travel repeatedly.

      Your detective puts an idea in my head - if he sends his past self a note after every case, telling himself the solution then it creates an exponentially branching tree of timelines with different versions of himself who have, to varying degrees, been assisted by those notes. And one timeline of "all the note branches" where he's never had to genuinely solve a case in his life... but then with every successive branching there's a new 'twig' on that branch that has, for the first time ever, failed to receive a note, and suddenly needs to learn to detective from scratch without letting on that his perfect record is kind of a sham...
      ```

      - u/callmebrotherg:
        ```
        Hm. While this wouldn't solve the problem entirely, the detective might ameliorate it by sending back complex mysteries (on the order of the ones that he's solving IOTL) that must somehow be solved in order to access or put together the notes for the case. 

        Or alternatively, he trusts in his own forethought and lack of crippling laziness and simply sends back the notes about his cases but also sends back the mysteries so that these other iterations of himself can work on them. Either way, while observation and people skills may not remain so sharp, the detective will at least be kept thinking in the right ways.

  What about the first person to be *brought forward* in time?
  ```

- u/ArgentStonecutter:
  ```
  If you take this to extremes you get *The Man who Folded Himself* by David Gerrold.

  ```
  That excerpt is really cool, and I think it has plenty of explanation. Write on.
