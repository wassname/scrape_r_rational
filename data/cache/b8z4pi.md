## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding and Writing Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*
* Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is *also* the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  So I've been thinking of a magic system. It works like this:

  All magic is powered by soul. Soul is a finite, non-regenerating resources. As far as anyone can tell, everyone has the same amount of soul. As a result, rather than spend soul directly, people invest their soul into objects which gain permanent magical powers from this act. Only the investor of a magical object can use it and only a single person can invest a given object.

  The ritual used to put some of your soul into an object is called the Endowment Ritual. It can be performed once per day and takes a small piece of your soul and puts it into an object. The better that you are with the ritual, the the larger the piece of soul you invest but this isn't massively meaningful because you can invest the same object multiple times. The more soul an object contains, the more powerful it is.

  There is also a Reclaim Ritual. This ritual breaks down (destroys utterly) an object and reclaims part of the soul invested in it. Doing this is never perfect and you will always loose some of the invested soul. Again, the better you are at it, the less you loose but since the only way to get better is to practice that is not a very useful fact. This ritual can be used both on your own objects (in which case the object is destroyed and the soul reclaimed) and the objects of others (in which case the object is still destroyed but the soul is lost).

  The Endowment Ritual isn't static. It needs to be subtly changed depending on the object you are investing and how much soul is already in it. The changes needed aren't obvious or instinctive and can only be found by extensive academic study. As a result there are only five Great Paths.

  A Great Path is a fully charted out path for the Endowment Ritual. By following it, you can fully invest your entire soul into an object. This provides the most powerful magical object possible (because everyone has the same amount of soul). Those who split their soul between multiple objects or follow a Lesser Path will end up with objects less powerful than those on the Great Path.

  Great Paths exist for: The Sword, The Lamp, The Tome, The Rope and the <I haven't decided yet>

  Lesser Paths exists (for example The Shield, The Watch, etc). Some provide useful powers but haven't been developed to their completion.

  The powers granted by an object depend on the amount soul invested in it. This can be devised into thirds. 

  During the first third, the object will only provide ambiguously supernatural powers. Your sword will be very sharp, cut easily and almost impossible to break. By listening to the song of the blade, some of that preternatural power can flow into you. This will let you wield the sword with great skill, blocking blows *almost* impossible for you to see, moving with strength and grace that seem *almost* more than your body could produce.

  During the second third, an object starts to produce overt supernatural effects. With a slash of your sword you can project a invisible cutting edge. By drawing deep on the blade song you could leap across a room to reach an enemy. When you fight, you are a blur, far faster than any mundane man.

  During the third stage, the objects starts to produce overt supernatural effects metaphorically connected to its nature. Your sword can *cut* things that are no longer physical or *kill* that which was never alive. 

  Even on a Great Path, not all objects are identical. An investigator on the Lamp path might even a Truth revealing light at phase two. A lighthouse keeper might get a light that burns through any fog and is seen by all those in danger. Your items powers will depend on the use you put it too and develop towards that goal.

    This sounds really neat -- your world is at a point in which the fundamentals of the system seem fairly clear, but there is still a lot of ground for enterprising souls (hee) to explore.

     - Are the empowerment stages empirically determined by characters in the setting or are they integral to the system?
     - Where did the Rituals come from and why are they limited in how often they can be cast? This does seem like a much simpler question to answer, of course.

      > Are the empowerment stages empirically determined by characters in the setting or are they integral to the system?

      I would sat the stages are in universe soft classifications. That means they probably have names too. I'll have to think of some. Good question.

      I also don't think they are hard boundaries either. Rather they are slices on an analogue continuum that stretches from mundane to supernatural. Splitting it into thirds is by conversion, since it matches with the preternatural -> supernatural -> metaphoric journey an item goes through. But you could cut the cake in a different way. Given that the rituals are studied by Academics, there probably are competing systems.

      > Where did the Rituals come from and why are they limited in how often they can be cast? This does seem like a much simpler question to answer, of course.

      I think the limits on the use of the rituals are practical rather than metaphysical. Trying to use the Endowment Ritual more than once a day will damage you/the object. You are forcing in new power before the old power has properly settled.

      As to where they came from - I think pre-history. Hunter-gather's likely learned how to put a bit of their soul into their spears or clubs or fish-bone needles. As civilisation advanced, so to did understanding of the processed. This was formalised (likely by great men standing on the shoulders of giants) into the current Endowment Ritual.

      Today, the current study is academic. Their are people in institutes of learning working to advance this area.

      This is an interesting question. Given the importance of the Endowment Ritual, charting its development would likely be interlinked with civilisations development. What was the equivalent of the Ancient Greek philosophers? Who was the Newton? Something for me (and anyone else interested) to think about.

    What in particular do you want people to riff off of? 

    A nice final object to put on a Great Path would be something that is traditionally associated with domestic work, since it would complement the other options. A loom, or knitting needles, first came to mind. The low levels would let you do your domestic duties quicker and the higher levels would let you make supernatural fabric (say, invisibility cloaks) or perhaps you could knit your enemies legs together?

    My question is, does talent come into it? Like, regardless of practise, some people are just more talented at some things than others to start with. Do talented people lose less soul on their first attempts?

    This is a neat idea. I would predict that eventually all paths of importance will be greater and that specialization will be really major.

    &#x200B;

    Imagine a country that invents the Great Path of the Anvil, the Great Path of the Birthing Bed, and the Great Path of the Training stick. Or something similar. Such a country could pump out a very well equipted and well trained army in a short timespan and therefore easily outcompete other countries. 

    &#x200B;

    Unless research are done to pool soul mojo then the major bottlenecks for a country are research of new Great Paths and the amount of the soul to invest. The latter could be fixed by some path related to increasing birthrate and the former might be solved by some variation of Great Path of the Tome.

      I really like the idea of Path knowledge being controlled by entities like governments. Keeping information on charted Paths secure could provide a significant strategic advantage. Depending on how adversarial international politics are and how hierarchical society is, nations might have developed entirely distinct Paths, and social elites might have access to more options or better information that would help them preserve superiority. If the setting is modern enough and capitalist in nature, I could imagine large corporations investing to research proprietary Paths, and Path espionage/leaks being a big issue.

      &#x200B;

      With Paths being as important as they are, it seems likely that entire cultures and ethnic identities might form around them. It's worth asking if Soul is perceived similarly to the soul in real-life Western culture. Are there religions in this setting, and how do they view Soul? Do people believe in an afterlife?
      ```

  - u/TyeJoKing:
    ```
    I assume people are born with Soul, in which case it is technically regenerative. Perhaps set it up so the only way to get new Soul is to invest enough of it in a child, which means people who have abused their Soul are less able to have children?

    I initially missed the "you can't Reclaim other people's souls", so I had lots of thoughts about Soul factories, Soul tax, or exponential growth. 

    What path people go for depends on how fast you can imbue your soul. If you can imbue your whole soul by the time you're twenty, the Great path is probably worth it. If it takes until you're 60, then it might be better to have multiple Lesser Path objects, getting each one faster as you get better at the ritual. A bag of tricks is better in more situations than a single powerful one.

    The poor have to spend their soul during the course of their job, the rich use objects they collected from others to make their lives easier or to gain resources.

    Imagine soul endowed birth control.

    On the other end of that, would soul empowered fertility pills affect the child?

  A question about society: 

  What do people call disasters / great events that lived through / suffered through them versus people who read about them in history books?

  My grandfather always called WW2 "The War", because as far as he was concerned, there was only one War, and it was the war he was personally involved in. But I call it WW2 because it's one of dozens of "historical" wars and has no special meaning to me (beyond the fact my grandfathers were involved in it).  

  But I think of 9/11, and I think the kids these days who were born after it and are currently yeeting about the place still call it 9/11, which is what it was called within a week or two of the event happening. I think September 11 was the "first" name, but then it got shortened. But I don't live anywhere near New York, and am definitely not a survivor / family of victim / first responder, so I'm not someone who "lived through" the event in the most meaningful sense. Do people in those groups call it something different? In her day-to-day, does the sister of a victim call it 911 or does she call it "the day Alex died"? 

  What about other places with omnipresent "disasters"? What do people in Rwanda call "The Rwandan Genocide"? What do the people of Cambodia call Pol Pot's atrocities, and how does that differ between the "young" and the "old"? 

  The reason I ask is because c. 1700 my vampires went through a huge demographic disaster: about 90-95% of all vampires were killed in what was effectively a plague, so most vampires alive today naturally don't remember it, but the ones who lived through it were kind of traumatised by it and not quite the same afterwards. I gave the disaster a couple of "cool" names that I was toying between: "the catastrophe" (pronounced cat-ass-troff, like in the French, because IDK that sounds badass to me), "the hecatomb", "the great death", but I can't picture a vampire who lost all her closest friends and allies using a name like that by default. At the moment I have a vampire character call it "that time", or "then", but I think that's really gimmicky too. 

  So, any thoughts? Any of the diverse denizens of this subreddit have local wars / genocides / earthquakes that are/were called different things by survivors and born-afters that I can use as inspiration?
  ```

  - u/xamueljones:
    ```
    I don't have any real-life experience or know anyone who would be able to answer, but when I read about disasters or wars in the past, they are almost universally named after the location that it occurred in.

    So I would suggest having the ones born afterwards just call the plague after where it appeared from. Kinda like how the bombing of Hiroshima is referenced by directly mentioning where it was bombed, Hiroshima.

    However, thinking about it, it's not a war or battle like you were asking in your descriptions. It's a plague, and the next best example is the Black Death which killed off 30 to 50% of all humans in Europe.

    People tend to name disasters either by the location where it occurred or by the most obvious feature of the individuals it impacted. I mean the Black Death was called that because people were literally turning black. So I suggest naming the plague after the most obvious feature of the infected or the place where it started from/killed the most individuals. Write down what an infected near death would look like, imagine the shock of seeing the infected for the first time, note the very first feature that you would pay attention too, and name the disease after it.

    Finally, I want to suggest that you rethink the 95% statistic. It's hard to explain too easily since it's a vague concept, but the infections that kill the most people aren't the ones that are perfectly lethal, it's the ones that leave a lot of survivors. If an infection kills it's host every time and too quickly, then it can't spread very far beyond the first town it appears in. The Black Death was so dangerous, because it left a large fraction of survivors to spread to even more people to infect and kill off. Maybe set the death total to be roughly 50%?

    Just a few comments from an intruder.

    Historically vampires were remote and incomprehensible and purely an otherness that threatened the living. Today's sympathetic model of vampires/werewolves/undead seems to have arisen with Anne Rice's "Interview with the Vampire." That novel and its sequel, "The Vampire Lestat," are about two men who in life were born and lived in late-Romantic France, the first being a kind of middle-class-mentality guy (Louis) and the second an insouciant aristocrat (Lestat). The first novel is full of pseudo-Romantic-French flourishes and cemented the general approach to being sympathetic to vampires in subsequent writing. From Rice's work proliferated a large variety of sympathetic interpretation of previously pure-otherness monsters, with werewolves referring to themselves as "Kindred" and such.

    tl;dr Your choice of a French-language pronunciation isn't only subjectively "badass" but in an odd way canonical. And following up on the late-Romantic-French-revivalism roots of the current approach to vampires may be helpful to you.

    I think people who actually lived through things often refer to them with names, dates, or places.  9/11 is still recent enough we use the date, but I wouldn't be surprised if in 50 years kids learning about it in history books call it the World Trade Center attack.

    With hurricanes, people are often like "I got out before Katrina", or things like that.  (It helps that hurricanes have human names.)

    Specific places or features of an experience also make their way into survivor languages.  We had a Holocaust survivor speak at my school when I was younger, and she always referred to things as "Auschwitz" or "the camps" rather than Holocaust.

    I think another heuristic is "what would someone have called this while it was happening?".  While you're in a war, it's just "the war".

    My instinct would be to either pick a name/date for ground zero ("I haven't felt like this since Venice", "I haven't felt like this since 1302"), or pick a generic term like "war" for what was happening ("I haven't file like this since the epidemic", "I haven't felt like this since the plague").

    The names changed because the old one was not that descriptive any more.  WWI isn't the great war that ended all wars any more because WWII happened and was even bigger.   "the war" was WWII to your grandpa, but someone who served in 'nam or one of the Iraqs will probably think of their war when they hear your grandpa talk about the war.

  **Dealing With Cheap World-Killers?**

  Given:

  - An interstellar society that beats reedspacer's lower bound, and has done so for a very long time;

  - An upgrade to physics, "Horizon Mechanics", which allows for the violation of conservation of energy in certain circumstances;

  - That it costs under $1billion to install a drive onto a 100,000-ton asteroid, which can accelerate it at half a gravity indefinitely;

  - That accelerating a 100,000-ton rock to 0.9c and steering it into Earth would cause an impact about 25 times the strength of the dinosaur-killer asteroid...

  Then what non-dystopian methods are most likely in play to prevent disgruntled space-truck drivers from destroying whatever nearby planet they like the least? (Among other disaffected individuals and groups organizations that can spare a billion on some asymmetric STL interstellar warfare.)

  Some possibilities:

  - Nobody bothers with planets anymore;

  - World-Killer detectors are cheap enough, and anti-WK interceptors are clustered thickly enough around any inhabited planet, to have a reasonably high chance of blowing up a WK before it gets too close;

  - Upgrading everyone to better-than-first-world luxury, curing disease and aging, allowing people uploading-based immortality, and giving them a galaxy to spread out in to avoid overcrowding, remove nearly everybody's potential urges to cause gigadeaths;

  - The drive's blueprints are the exclusive province of an extremely well-trusted group, such as copies of an em that has undergone extreme situations in virtual realities it didn't know were virtual at the time;

  - Something stranger, such as traffic space-cops armed with nukes and willing to use them for the most minor of offenses, or nigh-superhumanly-good patent lawyers, or etc...

  - All of the above at the same time, in a great big ball that's even more complicated than today's internet...

  ... What explanations can you think of that meet the general criteria, and let the setting stay generally hopeful overall? Which explanations cause the least amount of strain to your willing suspension of disbelief?

  Any German speakers want to weigh in on if "Zwieleiche" is cringy or stupid sounding? Its for a fantasy species invisible to anyone who hasnt witnessed a death a la thestrals from Harry Potter.

  While I'm asking, an intelligent species with this trait forms a close knit secret society in my story. They live in a world with normal people in it, and they have strong instincts to eat but typically resist because its too dangerous to poke the bear. Any ideas about their culture or does that make you think of anything?

    Double corpses? If so it's zwei, not zwie.

    Culture wise, it sounds like they have to keep themselves separated from the other species. If so, what conditions do they live in? Maybe they congregate in underground passages and secret rooms a la speakeasies.

    Maybe the other species have rumors and superstitions that started with someone failing to keep their desires in check.  The invisible people would probably need some kind of central authority to keep their members motivated to not feed, because in any intelligent species there will be strong willed individuals who have a different opinion from what the majority takes for granted.
