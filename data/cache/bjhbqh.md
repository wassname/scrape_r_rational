  Interesting so far. Worlds with set roles and levels are common around here, and while this definitely has a distinct voice already, I look forward to seeing how it differentiates itself from the others with similar-seeming mechanical underpinnings.

  I'm interested in seeing where this is going, which will probably determine how I feel about the work as a whole. Thus far, I'm getting *Divergent* vibes, though with a more litRPG basis to it. That's not necessarily bad, but it really depends on execution.
