## Stories based on Final Fantasy universe

What is some rational fiction based on the Final Fantasy universe?

(I know there are many of them but there are recurring themese, so I'm looking for either any Final Fantasy universe or a universe that resembles canon Final Fantasy universes)

  I haven't found any actual Final Fantasy rational fiction, but you may be interested in my own **Arcane Ascension** or **Weapons and Wielders** books. Both series are expressly inspired by JRPGs, including **Final Fantasy**, **Ys**, **Bravely Default**, etc.

  **Arcane Ascension** is a mix between a dungeon crawling book and a magical academy. There's a lot of emphasis on learning how magic works in an academy setting.

  **Weapons & Wielders** is a spin-off from both my **Arcane Ascension** series and my older **War of Broken Mirrors**. It's much more adventure focused; you can think of it as being more like **Zelda** or **Ys**, but there's still some **Final Fantasy** influence in there, and one of the protagonists is very directly FF4 inspired.

  They're rational in terms of characters using a lot of lateral thinking to solve problems, as well as a strong emphasis on hard magic and internal consistency. You should be aware that I don't write characters with the intention of them being just "intelligent" - I tend to write different characters having different *types* of intelligence and weaknesses in other forms of intelligence.

  For example, Corin tends to think about how he can exploit specific resources in the long-term, Sera is much better at social intelligence, and Keras is great at finding ways to just ignore the obvious answer to something and punch through it.

  This can be frustrating for some readers - there's a subset of the rational community (and fantasy fans in general) that prefers for characters that are basically a power fantasy of perfect intellect, and you should be aware I don't write anything like that.

    I didnt realize you were on this sub. Arcane ascension is such a great series. One of the best litrpgs I have read.

    Different types of intelligence? Respect and appreciation for the fact that there are many kinds of skills far beyond and outside of pure truth seeking/analysis/explicit epistemic updating, which are all just as useful and valuable? In a rational fic? That's not something I get to see very often.

    I'm intrigued, what's it about?

      ```
      Early/pre industrial setting, thereâ€™s 5 dungeon towers throughout the continent  created said to be created by a god, completing a challenge in the tower gives you a mark that gives you the ability to interact with mana in a specific way, such as shaping it into weapons, making contracts with monsters to summon them, or enchanting items. Corin goes to a school for people with these marks and is trying to learn about how to use his mark and how to improve, and wants to find his missing brother.

    ```
    Spells and skills that specifically appear in the game except for summons. I'd like to see the consequences of having people in the world who can cast e.g. Quake, Float, Haste, and have abilities such as Jump.
