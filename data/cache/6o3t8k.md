  I think an important context for this is his previous ["The Case Against News"](http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2011/03/the_case_agains_6.html). That is people respond hotheadedly to specific, sensational news stories when they should be coolly assessing overall statistics and institutional structures.

    That has its own problems:

    >Out of the approximately 10,000 news stories you have read in the last 12 months, name one that - because you consumed it - allowed you to make a better decision about a serious matter affecting your life, your career, your business - compared to what you would have known if you hadn't swallowed that morsel of news.

    That's bad for the same reason that LessWrong-style "is that your true rejection?" is bad: people often don't make decisions for a single reason.  No single news item changes your decisions by a noticeable amount, but the cumulative weight of many news items may do so.

    I actually agree with this one. The biggest problem with information gathering used to be a lack of availability. Nowadays we have the exact opposite: We have so much junk information flooding our systems, that it's impossible to effectively sort through all the information, [effectively making it so that each extra bit makes us less informed than before](http://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/the-library-of-heaven).

    The reason I still read the news is because if I don't know what *just* happened, everybody else will think I'm an uninformed lout. But I far prefer to read a single encompassing piece that exhausts all of the arguments on both sides of a political issue, rather than having to sift through a hundred crappy opinion-pieces in search of one that has something worthwhile to contribute.

  So I think the lesson is exile Muslims _and_ black people? Not sure, please advise.

    Ugh, that entire exchange frustrates me so much. Caplan says that the left hates free markets. EY comes to the rescue and says "no no, the left doesn't *hate* free markets - they're just too stupid to understand them!" Thanks a bunch, mr. rationalist.

    Here, let me try my hand at defining the two sides: The right is afraid of loss of socio-economic cohesion, i.e. as brought about through immigration or radical policies. The left is excited about the potential for socio-economic progress, i.e. as brought about through income redistribution and social justice. One side is young and intuitively risk-taking, the other tends to be older and risk-averse.

    And guess what? Both sides have an entirely valid point! Inviting a million unvetted refugees into America ala Germany really does sound incredibly stupid. There really is an income inequality problem in America, and there really is still systemic racism. What irritates me is that both sides constantly try to pretend that the other side's point doesn't even exist: "It's not that Trump voters are all racist - they're just sad that they don't get enough government handouts." The people linked to above somehow fail to understand *either* perspective.

    I'm starting to see why Yudkowsky wrote that politics is the mindkiller. Bloody hell.

      This was an excellent comment right up until the point at which you succumbed to your temptation to take a nice satisfying potshot at libertarianism. "Politics is the mindkiller", indeed.
      ```

      - u/Sophronius:
        ```
        I've edited it, because you're right that it was too much of a cheap shot. 

        But, just so I can have the last word I'll add a second annoyance - use of "Politics is the mindkiller" to dismiss viewpoints purely because they use charged language. Just because I'm annoyed doesn't mean I'm wrong.

  I got where Socrates was coming from. But the latter half caused me to squint, metaphorically, and I completely rolled my eyes at the last line. He's playing fast and loose with a few concepts.
  ```

- u/Jiro_T:
  ```
  There's a fine line between a Socratic dialog and a straw man. 

  "Spartans are fellow Greeks, and Persians are not, so we should not do things to prevent Spartan crime that we should do to prevent Persian crime" does not imply that you can just redefine "Greek" and make the argument about anyone.  "Greek" is a preexisting category; you don't get to pick what goes in it; and if you honestly think being a fellow Greek has no implications for how you should feel or act towards someone, you're not only weird, but weird in a way which only exists in Aspergers patients, sociopaths, and internet-rationalists.

  It's also odd that Socrates says that he doesn't care much because he doesn't personally know the victims--why does he think that "personally know" is a meaningful reason to care but "is a fellow Greek" is not?

  Also, if I take this argument literally, it's opposed to effective altruism.  Socrates is arguing that he shouldn't care about all murders, not that he should care a lot about all murders.
  ```

  - u/Kosijenac:
    ```
    Could you give me some sources on the aspergers & sociopathy claim? Some quick searching only shows anecdotal evidence, although I haven't looked for any published papers yet. I don't quite have the time.
    ```
