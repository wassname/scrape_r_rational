Anything rational and star wars would be sweet.

  Nope, doesn't exist (so far as I know). See threads [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2mmyoo/any_good_star_wars_rational_fics_i_need_to_get/) or [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2b0img/star_wars_rational_take/) for more discussion, but unless someone has written one in the meantime it just doesn't exist.

    Nice, the first discussion you linked was fantastic, shame it doesn't seem like anybody's used any of the ideas in that thread for a actual star wars story. Thanks for the links!

  I always recommend the Sun of Sons trilogy by blank101 whenever I see a thread like this on r/hpmor. While not explicitly rationalist, it is quite intelligent, and all characters make full use of the resources they have available to them.

  I'm working on an idea in this area, but I need to work out the (crunchy, mathy) details of how hyperspace works first. I hope to make the Death Star actually *make sense* (though not for the reason you'd expect).
