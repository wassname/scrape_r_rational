    I know, right?!? This is going to be an awesome aerial battle!

        not really but this webnovel hyped them quite a bit. Flying fortresses is more of the stuff you find on various posters but not inside the product.
        ```

        They also feature a few times during the Malazan Book of the Fallen series.
        ```

        They're pretty common in post-4e DnD, and existed in the Forgotten Realms' history in the form of ancient Netheril's flying cities. 

        Also, more classically, there's the giant's castle from the fairy tale Jack and the Beanstalk.
        ```

- u/None:
  ```
  I particularly like how their styles are contrasted. You just know that Cat would have dealt with this by walking directly into an ambush, smacking fey around, demanding to be taken to someone with authority, then brazenly trading away the info for a hugely presumtuous favour, while getting herself tied up in about six more intrigues by accident.

  ```
  I'm dying to know what Name Masego almost transitioned to.
  ```

  - u/Iconochasm:
    ```
    Burninating Death Nerd.  Aspects **Study**, **Evoke**, and ***Technically...***.
    ```

  - u/MoralRelativity:
    ```
    Yeah me too. Do you have any ideas? I came up blank.
    ```

    - u/aeschenkarnos:
      ```
      I think he's on his way to Archmage.
      ```

      - u/MoralRelativity:
        ```
        Nice. I hope it happens soon. He needs a power-up to whip the Diabolist's butt.
        ```

    - u/CeruleanTresses:
      ```
      Seems like whatever it is, it might have some relationship to efficiency.
      ```

      - u/MoralRelativity:
        ```
        Yes, he does like that: low effort, large effects.
        ```

    - u/AurelianoTampa:
      ```
      Taking a guess: Ritualist. His curiosity was really based around understanding the ritual that Akua used, and following that would likely lead to some sort of Name involving rituals. And he's used many rituals already in the story. Ritualist seems like it would fit the bill.
      ```

- u/JdubCT:
  ```
  Masego you sweet pedant. Reading from his pov is such a joy.

  PS: ARCHER GET!
  ```

  - u/MoralRelativity:
    ```
    :) Love it.
    ```
