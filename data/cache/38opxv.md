  The game is linear and it takes a lot of time and resources to make branching paths so there's generally only one or two ways to defeat an argument, unlike in real life - that's a flaw of Ace Attorney too. But aside from that, the game does a decent job of teaching some intelligent debating techniques and how to point out flaws in someone else's and your own arguments. Though I'm not sure the argument used against Hobbes' philosophy worked perfectly.

  I'll second this. I played it around a year ago and really enjoyed it.

  I often found myself stuck because I want to debate a very different point then the game does. I'm an ancap I don't fucking care about the recursive problem of hobbes, I wanted to get into the nitty gritty about what he might by "social contracts", and how exactly someone signs one with a "benevolent" dictator when I absolutely wouldn't want to.

    Yeah, the game is pretty linear so there's only one argument you can make against each presentation, which is a shame. As far as social contracts go, I'm pretty sure we're forced into them just by being born or living in a particular country. I think Thoreau argued that someone can separate themselves from society willingly but in practice that's very difficult.

  There's a nice Phoenix Wright reference in Jon Stuart Mill's chapter.

  This game is a surprisingly decent Ace Attorney-style game. It really has a lot of the same pros and cons that the series had, and the humor is pretty similar. So I'd say if you actually like the Ace Attorney gameplay, then check it out.

  I'm playing it now. If the game ends with "And therefore, moral utilitarianism is the correct answer" I'm gonna be miffed. Come to think of it, if it says, "Gee, I guess there's no clear answer" I'll also be miffed, so I don't really know what I want. :/
