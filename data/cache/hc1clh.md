  Hmmm. Is Cordelia devolving into a Kim Jong? Losing leverage, failing to expand or maintain infrastructure, losing the ability to control her own people, until all she has left is the nukes?

  Her inability to back down here is a _huge_ tell in any case, and it's seemingly _weakened_ her in the power dynamic between her and Catherine. So what's going on? What's her real game here?

    ```
    She wants an "I'm fucked, but you're also fucked" button, so if the Dead King overruns Procer on his way to eating the whole continent she can press the button. Sure, she'll lose too, but he'll lose too. Lycaonese as fuck.
    ```

      That makes sense from a rational game-theoretic standpoint.

      What *doesn't*, in any way immediately obvious to me, is to show her hand so forcefully. She didn't brush Catherine off with a "sure, we can talk about that later sometime," or take any other number of routes available to hold onto the weapon tightly while acting diplomatic about it. She's not letting it go, and she's sending a crystal clear message to Catherine both that she's not letting it go and that she's not even going to pretend that there could ever be any possibility that she lets it go.

      That's what I meant when I said it weakens her in their power dynamic-- she has just signaled something very strongly about her own intentions and motivations, and I don't know what she hopes to gain by sending that signal.

      I wonder what the Augur's been up to?

  I have to assume Cordelia has some form of insight provided by the Augur.  The Augur is still in play, right?  I'm a little surprised by how little of her we've seen lately.

  Also, if it's true Augur can't see angels, any insight she provides must be based on how other entities (the alliance, the empire, the kingdom under, etc.) would respond.

    The Augur is susceptible to Bard meddling tho
    ```

    - u/MimicSquid:
      ```
      But also has shown she can resist it.
      ```

      - u/Papa-Walrus:
        ```
        Yeah, the Augur might be at the top (or very close) of the list of Named *least* susceptible to Bard's meddling. Very few Named have proven themselves both willing and able to outfox the Bard.
        ```
