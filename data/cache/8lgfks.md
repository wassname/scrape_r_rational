  That oath to the Pilgrim is going to be spent on something for Cat, either at keeping to some terms or the Liesse accords.

  Also: greater evil emerging, **either the dead king or the tower**?  I was skeptical at first but this seems like further evidence that Triumphant is returning.

    Now that'd set up a proper crusade!
    ```

    ```
    Or the Hierarch and the Tyrant. One that plays the game like a fiddle, another that hates everything it stands for.

  Damn. It seemed to be going well after the last chapter too. As pissed off as I am against the Pilgrim for doing that, I can't bring myself to actually dislike him. He seems to be a genuinely good person who isn't blinded by the Good and Evil labels like the other heroes we've seen.

    ```
    I'm not even pissed at him, personally. When the sky opens up and drops a lake on top of thousands of people, and you have the power to make said lake stop falling on thousands of people, what else can you do?
    ```

    - u/Ardvarkeating101:
      ```
      Make sure I aim better next time?
      ```

      - u/TaltosDreamer:
        ```
        Right? 
        Mental note: more boulders next time
        ```

      I was thinking more in terms of his actions putting Cat into a weird fae-coma and  and Masego on life support.

      But you're right that it isn't fair to blame him.

  Looking forward to Thief pulling a Weekend At Bernie's during the parley!
  ```

  - u/GeeJo:
    ```
    The Prince of Nightfall could give her some Glamour to keep the charade going. And Thief's definitely the better one to stick it on - having Archer in charge of any kind of negotiations can only end poorly.

  Why is the chapter called "Kaleidoscope"?  
  Is it Kat's body kaleidoscoping in a weird way? The battlefield? The perspective changes in the chapter?
  ```

  - u/DeliciousDelicious:
    ```
    Same view that changes at different angles?
    ```

    ```
    The titles always have multiple meanings, but what struck me most was that the two sides did the same thing (power gambit killing tons of people, a full seventh of cat's host was killed by the wall play) but that everyone in the interlude including juniper sees cats actions as the monstrous and scary ones. The proceran fences were just good tactics, apparently.

    It appears to be some named/weight thing, in that the walls were made by lots of npcs and the portal by two named, but the juxtaposition felt very "through the looking glass" to me.

    Edit: to add a bit more, it has got me rethinking the setting a fair bit. It explains why Amadeus is so successful, since his whole schtick is making best use of non-named and avoiding weight and backlash. Also explains why the gnomes hate technological advancement, which would disrupt the status quo that keeps the whole continent down, by making named less relevant. Effectively they don't need to police Calernia because the stories enforce stagnation.

    I know these thoughts are nothing new, but this chapter has given me a bunch to think about.

  ```
  Disappointed that Cat is still winning by maiming herself and her allies. 

  Prince’s Folly is likely Amadis insisting that the Procerans attack while Kat is incapacitated despite the Pilgrim arguing for caution.  Trudging through an icy swamp filled with corpses will be a very bad situation when Kat awakens from her coma with a new name.  I’m curious to see what dilemma Kat‘s inner devil and angel argue about during this name dream.
  ```

  - u/Empiricist_or_not:
    ```
    That or it becomes the princes graveyard after someone hurts one of Cat's inner circle while she is out.
    ```

    - u/Taborask:
      ```
      I actually think there's a chance one of the Woe is gong to bite it. The only characters we know for sure survive the story are Juniper and Aisha (from chapter header quotes) so anyone else is fair game. honestly, one of my few beefs with the story is the lack of real consequences or failures until now. only three important characters have died, one of which turned out to be a traitor. my money is on robber or Archer
      ```

      - u/FeO_Chevalier:
        ```
        Hakram has an oath with Cat that ends on their reunion.  He’s narratively doomed.
        ```

- u/TaltosDreamer:
  ```
  I love seeing how scared she makes them.  Though it worries me Saint and Pilgrim hurting her like this. At this rate they are cutting winter back down to an aspect again :(
