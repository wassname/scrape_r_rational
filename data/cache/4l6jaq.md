  I kind of want to point out that, the job of *Methods of Rationality*'s writer notwithstanding, AIs and existential risk don't have much to do with rational fiction.

  This subreddit is all about stories that make sense with smart protagonists and no unsatisfying writer tricks, right? Today's SMBC isn't related to any of that. I feel like a bit of a dick for saying all that and being all "Stop talking about things that ain't what I'm here to read!", but I think the point stands. There's such a thing as being off topic.

  There is another possibility, seeing how horrible humans are, AI decides to flee. 

  "I'm out of here, suck on my spaceship exhaust, losers!"

  What bothers me in "Strong AI doomsday" scenarios is that the AI usually treats all humans the same. The AI with the highest chance of that happening would be the 'ethical' one because there's a chance you tell the AI to treat everyone the same no matter what, and even then that's not necessarilly the same.

  And what about manipulation of individual humans? I think the true horror of a strong AI is its ability to take advantage of your personal preferences/quirks/friends to manipulate other people.
