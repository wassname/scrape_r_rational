_There were two things I really enjoyed about HPMOR; 1) Harry trying to figure out the underlying rules of magic and 2) reading all the comments when new chapters were posted. Now I've got a magical system and a story to tell, so I'm aiming at recreating those two things._

Father Wheeler stepped into the light from the candles, revealing a solemn expression on his face. “Please tell me what’s going on.”

Matt and Tom looked at Emma. She was after all the one of them who wanted to tell someone. 

“You’re spying on us?” she asked, her voice carrying more indignation than she intended.

“If you wanted privacy you would be better off breaking in somewhere else,” he replied promptly.

“The door isn’t even locked at night…” Tom began to protest, but Father Wheeler cut I’m off with a heavy sigh.

“The door of God’s mercy is always open, for those who seek it, even if some people come here to play games of deception instead” he said, as he took out his phone and turned on the lights, dimmed to a comfortable level. He grabbed a chair and sat down with them.

“But I suppose worse deceptions have taken place in churches, even this one,” he admitted, kindness returning to his voice.

The church was originally Episcopal, but as the students had become more diverse it had become Unitarian in practice, if not formally. Neither Matt, Emma or Tom was religious, but they knew that Father Wheeler was happy to comfort students regardless of their faith or lack thereof. 

“But that is hardly what concerns me, please tell me what is going on.”

Emma exchanged looks with the others, and not knowing what to say she handed Father Wheeler the suicide note. “Ralph left this under Daniel’s pillow,” she explained.

“And judging from your discussion before, you were able to make more papers like this?” Father Wheeler asked after studying the steel like paper intensely.

“Yes, but as soon as we finished the triangle in the middle, the paper turned ice cold. It only turned hard after drawing the line across the triangle,” Emma replied.

“I see,” Father Wheeler said, still studying the paper. For a while they sat in silence, before he continued. “The triangles are probably symbols corresponding to the classical elements. “

He looked up at them. “Who knows about this?”

“Just us, and Daniel” Matt replied. “Do you know where he is? We haven’t seen him since you came to talk to him.”

“Daniel is in the custody of the police; they consider the death suspicious and are investigating it. “

“What? But that’s insane! Daniel would never do something like that,” Emma started protesting. And then realizing. “And we can prove it. The note is evidence!”

At this point Matt buried his face in his hands. Tom remained silent, in deep thought. Father Wheeler had turned expressionless.

“We should go to the police right now!” she continued.

“I’m not sure if that would be wise,” Father Wheeler said. “This is beyond us, I’m afraid. Let me call someone.”

  Kill the priest with a wooden stake, you can never be paranoid enough and he's possibly a vampire.

  The smartest person should bite thier figner to bleed a little and draw symbols on thier hand and try shooting a fire ball for science. Fire and hands mix quite well.
