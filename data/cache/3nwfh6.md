## [Biweekly Challenge] Precommitment

### Post:

## Last Time

[Last time,](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3m4s4n/biweekly_challenge_dangerously_genre_savvy/?sort=confidence) the prompt was "Dangerously Genre Savvy". /u/ZeroNihilist is the winner with their story ["From Earth Prime With Love"](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3m4s4n/biweekly_challenge_dangerously_genre_savvy/cvcl2vv), and will receive a month of reddit gold along with super special winner flair. Congratulations /u/ZeroNihilist!

##### This Time

The next challenge will be **"Precommitment"**. In the classic game theory sense, [precommitment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precommitment) means that in a game of chicken, you throw your steering wheel out the window so that there's no element of choice involved and any rational actor will know that you're incapable of changing your mind. In essence, it's a strategy of removing options in order to strengthen a position in a conflict. This is one of the more rationalist concepts we've had for a challenge; I'm curious to see how it does. Remember, prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

The winner will be decided **Wednesday, October 21st.** You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

##### Rules

* 300 word minimum, no maximum. Post as a link to Google Docs, pastebin, Dropbox, etc. **This is mandatory.**

* No plagiarism, but you're welcome to recycle and revamp your own ideas you've used in the past.

* Think before you downvote.

* Winner will be determined by "best" sorting.

* Winner gets reddit gold, special winner flair, and bragging rights.

* All top-level replies to this thread should be submissions. Non-submissions (including questions, comments, etc.) belong in [the meta thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/39dxi3), and will be aggressively removed from here.

* Top-level replies must be a link to Google Docs, a PDF, your personal website, etc. It is suggested that you include a word count and a title when you're linking to somewhere else.

* In the interest of keeping the playing field level, please refrain from cross-posting to other places until after the winner has been decided.

* No idea what rational fiction is? [Read the wiki!](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index)

##### Meta

If you think you have a good prompt for a challenge, [add it to the list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B6HaZc8FYkr6l6Q4cwBc9_-Yq1g0f_HmdHK5L1tbEbA/edit?usp=sharing) (remember that [a good prompt is not a recipe](http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/prompts?src=RECIPE)). If you think that you have a good modification to the rules, let me know in a comment [in the meta thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/39dxi3). Also, if you want a quick index of past challenges, I've [posted them on the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/weeklychallenge).

##### Next Time

Next time, the challenge will be "Fables and Legends". This is a broad topic that covers everything from Aesop's Fables to Hansel and Gretel, with a lot of leeway. The most well known rationalist fable is [Nick Bostrom's Fable of the Dragon Tyrant](http://www.nickbostrom.com/fable/dragon.html) which is a good example of the sort of feeling you might want to go for.

**Next challenge's thread will go up on 10/21.** Please confine any questions or comments to [the meta thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/39dxi3). If you want to discuss the week's theme, [see this companion thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3nwhr7/challenge_companion_thread_precommitment/).

    Interesting--i like the concept.  I couldn't identify with the character much though.

      I feel the captured Hyuuga isn't meant to be a protagonist the reader identifies with, but rather as an arctype and a character study. In a typical story, you usually want a protagonist to follow, but I feel this work is something smaller and different. A fable perhaps.
      ```

    Hyuuga are hardcore.

    Would a version of the Hyuuga that didn't have a "main family" function better? The main family strikes me as such a security hole. If everyone were sealed and their lineage and governance was like any other clan (Not that canon ever elaborates on clan governance), with their brainwashing Hyuuga-worship, it seems like it would be much stronger.

      My canon: remote seal activation can only be initiated by seal users who do not have the slave seal.

        I'm fairly sure that is canon.

      Actually, I've only just created an account, so I don't have much experience with how the reddit infrastructure works.  I've enjoyed reading /r/rational fiction for a while now, and been regretful that I couldn't see a way to make comments without registering, but it was today that I first read through the Biweekly Challenge runners-up, started musing about what I would/could write for Precommitment, had an idea, wanted to write down the idea, wrote down the idea and created an account so I could post it.

      (Do you need to post to vote?)  --Looking at https://www.reddit.com/wiki/voting , voting should instead be the grey arrows to the left of the comments (I think), in which case what prompted your question?

      (Hmm, only one day left until voting ends in any case, so I'm very late for this.  Nevertheless, I'm happy that it has a chance to be read by others (rather than stewing in this head eternally without exiting).)

    There's something interesting going on in the background there, and I'm not sure what...

    Is the casino cheating, somehow for some reason?  Double-sided coins are mentioned.  Is there a mob involved, probably running the casino, and maybe they're double-crossing the guy with the brain box?  Then I start to wonder, "to what end?"  What's the significance of the on-screen box going red?  Presumably a loss.
    ```

    - u/MultipartiteMind:
      ```
      [Spoilers for anyone who hasn't read the story:  ](#s "Indeed, the box glowing red is just a dramatic/{vaguely horrifying} way of signifying that the person inside is never going to be woken up.  'To what end':  The house always wants to win in the end.  Even if it's only a tiny percentage of universes--a tiny probability for a given universe--that the current owners of the casino lose the casino to the box-person, they're not going to take that risk.  So, once the box-person gets enough questions right, the casino is going to take all his money back with a double-sided coin showing whichever side he bet against that round.  The box-person thinks he's consolidating all his wealth into a small portion of universes, but what actually happens is that the casino consolidates all his universes' wealth into their coffers.  In the end, the House always wins.")

  Here is my entry, ["Fixing Chicken"](http://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/130738078226/fixing-chicken), set in the same universe as most of my other fiction.
  ```

  - u/GrecklePrime:
    ```
    Having only read The Fall of Doc Future, does this have any spoilers for the second or third one in it?
    ```

    - u/Kishoto:
      ```
      I've read the story. It has 0 spoilers for anything in the series. It actually takes place a few years before the first book.
      ```

    - u/DocFuture:
      ```
      No, I wrote it as a prequel with no spoilers for Fall or any of the later books, so if someone likes it they can still read Fall unspoiled.
