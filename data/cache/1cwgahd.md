## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  If you're not subscribed to Astral Codex Ten, the [Book Review Contest](https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/choose-book-review-finalists-2024) submissions is a pretty good place to find 150 reviews of both fiction and non-fiction that you might be interested in. Randomly picking reviews entries from the list has gotten me to add several books to my reading list.

  Notably, there are reviews of A Practical Guide to Evil and r!Animorphs, two entries that readers of this sub would probably recognize (though I'd say the review for the former is a particularly poor entry).

  I recently went back and reread [Mother of Learning](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21220/mother-of-learning), having stopped somewhere around the midpoint when I last read it. 

  I'd affirm the standing recommendation for it, albeit with a lot more caveats now that I've actually made it (near) the end (still reading it), and am a little older and hopefully wiser. 

  ---

  **The Good:**

  The main gimmick is very well used for the majority of the story, and *for the most part* (more on that later) avoids grating via repetition, which is obviously one of the main pitfalls with a timeloop story.

  The twists and subversions - the arrival of Red Robe and >!his departure!<, the nature of the time loop, >!the fate of!< the aranea, etc. - are well-handled and contribute to a lack of repetition and boredom, as despite ostensibly repeating the same month, the stakes are largely able to evolve and keep up pressure. 

  The magic is *for the most part* well-explained without verging over into exposition dumps, which is something a lot of magic-heavy royalroad stories fall into.

  The cast of characters is varied and reasonably well-developed, and the 'looping' structure lets the author develop them in a kind of spiral fashion for the most part. Zorian draws more out, or is confronted with some different trait or aspect of their character due to some different approach he's taking. 

  The worldbuilding is quite good, avoiding the '[place] but fantasy' method, and also managing to be descriptive yet suggestive, not overexplaining too much and letting you enjoy the stranger parts fo the setting.

  Consistently good technical aspects and proofreading, as expected when something is in-development for a decade I suppose.

  ----

  **The Bad:** 

  This is a bit longer, because negativity requires a bit more of an explanation in my experience.

  It's a few different smaller complaints, but I'd unify them by saying that a lot of the steps taken to minimize expected drawbacks of this looping story structure end up making it feel a good bit less satisfying.

  First, especially by chapter 80 or so, there is little sense of any day-to-day stakes, and the prose starts to reflect that by skipping over half a dozen, a dozen loops at a time *despite new and important things occurring in these loops*. This sort of thing was fine earlier on, when we glossed over a few loops of training, or Zorian just going to school or whatever, but at one point we skip over the entirety of >!Zorian seeking out the remaining Morlocks and learning blood magic from them!<. Now, setting aside how it's odd that we don't really see >!Kael!< involved or offering input on that, that's like, a whole arc worth of story and development! But, you know, you also realize that if that arc was actually written, you'd find yourself skimming through it, because haven't we already done the whole "Zorian (& co.) use looping to wiggle their way into being tutored by a strange/reclusive/powerful being in some strange/esoteric/powerful variant of magic", many times now? So it makes sense why you'd want to avoid retreading that ground... but that doesn't take away from the frustration of something clearly significant, eventful, and relevant to the climax of the story being brushed aside in a short passage.

  Really, the main way to avoid that fork would have been to not introduce such an element in the first place, but the escalating stakes demand that sort of thing by the later stages of the story. Which leads into my next major concern - when the stakes are at their apparent highest, they also feel completely absent. Late in the story, when they've found out that >!they have a limited number of restarts left!<, and must >!figure out a way to get out, and ensure a 'perfect run' once they do!<, despite the stakes being ostensibly at their highest, we've also reached the absolute nadir of tangible pressure. No single entity in the loop can challenge them, they have all a possible resources at their disposal, they can >!bring anyone else into the loop if they want!< and don't really bother addressing the moral questionability of that - or the >!simulacra!<, for that matter. Even when our main character gets his very >!soul roasted!< you only get a bare second of real risk and concern.

  My other complains are more mundane and less structural - the prose gets dry in places, and the dialogue is a particular recurring weak point, occasionally feeling like it's 'what a character of [certain archetype] might say here' rather than 'what *Zorian*/*Kael*/*Zach* would say here'. Finally, I guess I'd say that the supposed antisocial nature of Zorian feels a little skin deep. When he does act taciturn, paranoid, or abrasive, people just brush it off. There's never any real consequences for his supposed initial reclusive-bitter-nerd characterization, and he manages to make friends quite easily as the story goes along, leaving that part feeling like more of a thin coat of paint to spice him up than a real important element of his character.

  ----

  So, not the sort to assign a number/letter grade, but overall I have very mixed feelings about Mother of Learning, though in the final analysis I do think it's worth taking a crack at if you haven't.
  ```

  - u/Seraphaestus:
    ```
    I agree with most of your critique but not so much on the Zorian characterisation. At the start of the story he has a terrible relationship with his family, no friends, he actively rebuffs attempts for people to get closer to him in ways that hurt those people. The reason you don't see him being abrasive as the story goes on is because his character develops. He makes friends easily because the problem was always him, not a lack of opportunity
    ```

    - u/DM_ME_YOUR_HUSBANDO:
      ```
      Also a substantial portion of the lack of abrasiveness has to do with stuff that changes in his personal situation very early into the timeloop. >!Namely, his soul assimilating a portion of Zach's charismatic soul, and him learning to control his mental magic so being around other people doesn't feel irritating anymore!<
      ```

  - u/PancakeMenace:
    ```
    I completely agree. The first time around, it was very novel and compelling, since it was essentially the pioneer of the time loop genre. Like before MOL there were no good time loop stories (other than that Naruto one).

    I recently tried to re-read it and couldn't get past the first few chapters. The prose is very poor, especially if you've been reading traditionally published works.
    ```

    - u/staged_interpreter:
      ```
      Care to name the Naruto one? I'm interested. Only other time loop fiction I know of tha% is decent would be Purple Days.
      ```

      - u/Darkpiplumon:
        ```
        It's probably [Time Braid](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644/1/Time-Braid). Very sexual and with some dark rapey stuff, not always related.

        I liked it when I read it ten or so years ago, but it may have aged poorly.


        Edit: More info.

        There's a lot of focus on power exploration and developing abilities that may appeal to MoL fans.

        There's also some porn/sexual stuff that may not be your cup of tea and take a good percentage of the story.
        ```

        - u/ahasuerus_isfdb:
          ```
          IIRC there are at least 3 separate components to *Time Braid*:

          * Power exploration
          * Mind control-based horror (2 separate sections, one of them long)
          * Sex/harem stuff

          The power exploration part was fun.

          The "mind control horror" part was uncomfortable, but I guess it was a way to give the time-looping protagonist a real challenge that couldn't be undone with a simple suicide technique.

          The sex/harem part felt "grafted" and out of character for everyone involved. I had the same reaction when reading [the author's *Daniel Black* series](https://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/ea.cgi?282604).
          ```

          - u/NTaya:
            ```
            I've read enough fanfiction that harem stuff just made me sigh in exasperation, but mind control horror was icky and out-of-the-established-rules enough that it made me drop the story.
            ```

            - u/ahasuerus_isfdb:
              ```
              One of the issues that authors of time loop fiction face is giving their characters a meaningful challenge. If everything gets reset at the end of each loop, then nothing that happens to your characters really matters since there are no stakes.

              So far I have seen the following approaches:

              * Limit the number of loops that your characters have before the loop ends, e.g. >!Mother of Learning!<, >!Replay!<
              * Psychological damage due to torture, extremely unpleasant death, etc.
              * Mind control
              * Soul damage

              The last three are likely to be "icky", so I guess it's an ... occupational hazard?
              ```

              - u/NTaya:
                ```
                It's less about ickiness in a vacuum and more that it felt, at least at the time, severely clashing with the rest of the story. If the MC of WtC got into a time loop and was at risk at being permanently mindfucked with Soul Magic, it would've felt like a natural obstacle and not icky at all.
                ```

                - u/ahasuerus_isfdb:
                  ```
                  An interesting point. It so happens that I tried re-reading *Time Braid* a few weeks ago. I got to the end of the first mind control section and I thought that it felt organic because the challenge that the protagonist faced matched her power level. I didn't get to the second mind control section, so I can't be sure, but I recall it feeling less organic and more icky.
                  ```

  - u/serge_cell:
    ```
    Completely disagree about main part of "The Bad". OP  want more skin of teeth victories which essentially mean more plot armor and less common sense. Because *any* skin of teeth  victory is form of plot armor, because it mean low probability of win. Minimal amount of plot armor is *the* staple of rationally adjusted story. In settings where repeated skin of teeth victories required good story would hint on some behind the scene powers in play (Worm) .
    ```

    - u/lillarty:
      ```
      I don't think I agree with that interpretation. How I would put it is that "skin of the teeth victories" display *tactical* brilliance, while you prefer *strategic* brilliance. Strategic brilliance would avoid entering into a disadvantageous battle to begin with, while tactical brilliance may not see the disadvantageous battle coming, but once they're in it they defy the odds to win. There's plenty of ways to write a tactical victory without resorting to plot armor (look at about half of Caesar's battles for real-life examples).

  Been working my way through some of higher rated complete RR stuff, and recently finished [Chasing Sunlight](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/73475/chasing-sunlight?utm_source=home&utm_medium=completed) and [A Nerubian's Journey](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/60925/a-nerubians-journey?utm_source=home&utm_medium=completed).

  **Chasing Sunlight:** This is a weird one. If you've played any of the games in the Fallen London series (Fallen London, Sunless Sea, Sunless Skies, Mask of the Rose), then you should feel right at home with the general weirdness and steampunk Victorian meets cosmic horror setting. I really liked it, but it takes place in a setting where the rules of reality aren't fully understood or made clear, so it's not one of those things where you can anticipate what'll happen next (in my experience, one of the best parts of rational fiction). That said, it's a fun, trippy journey through a non-Euclidean underworld dimension where knowledge is power and power is dangerous.

  It's not really rational, but it was a lot of fun. I think it reminded me of UNSONG in some ways, although with a lot fewer puns and humor. It's one of those things where the author explains what happens and why, but you need to squint at it and go "Oh... okay... I kinda see why that made sense, even if it was absolutely unpredictable based on how reality works in... y'know, real life."

  Incidentally, I've read this same author's more popular series, Paranoid Mage, and this is LEAGUES better, IMO.

  **A Nerubian's Journey:** An isekai where a guy dies and gets reborn in the Warcraft universe as a spider person, a few years before (canonically) the entire kingdom is wiped out and raised as undead by the Lich King. Now he has a few years to solve a bunch of Azeroth's problems using his meta knowledge, or else he and his new kingdom are doomed.

  It's... ok. If you're not a Warcraft fan or WoW player, I don't think you'll enjoy it much. If you are, boy oh boy, it's chock full of references and cameos. I did like that the MC fully embraced his new species and wasn't just a "human in a spider person body." But otherwise, it's just kind of OK. The ending also felt a bit rushed, as if the author got tired of writing it. Not sure if that was the case, but I remember getting to the last chapter, seeing there were none left, and realizing a lot was about to be wrapped up really quickly. I can say it made me want to go back to WoW for the first time in several years - although I quickly squashed that feeling. But it was a good trip down memory lane.

  I also started (and stopped) reading **"**[**The Power of 10**](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/37348/the-power-of-ten-sama-rantha-the-tip-of-the-spear)**."** I made it 10 chapters in and it was an absolute slog that mostly was character class creation and info dumps. The author's notes explains that a bit, but unless you're REALLY into D&D, I don't see being able to enjoy it. Maybe it gets better later on, but the author warns the number crunching never goes away, so I dropped it.

  With those, I've read a fair amount of the top stories; others have including MoL (we all know it), The Perfect Run (pretty entertaining), A Journey of Red and Black (long enough to last a while, but not amazing), Rock falls everyone dies (funny and short), Paranoid Mage (ended up very mediocre to me with a lot of dropped plot points), Vigor Mortis (I liked it), Everybody Loves Large Chests (read it years ago, may go back to finish it, although I don't recall liking it that much back in the day), and Worth the Candle (I loved it, though it's not everyone's cup of tea - but we all know it here).

  For ongoing series I keep up to date with Super Supportive and The Game at Carousel. I'd recommend both of those. I also started Pale Lights (same author as Practical Guide to Evil) and Zenith of Sorcery (same author as MoL), but both post so infrequently that I've fallen behind on them.

  Any other RR recommendations?
  ```

  - u/serge_cell:
    ```
    The Power of 10 is horrible. The fact that it is one of highest rated stories on RR is border on supernatural.

    About RR recommendation, many promising starts become "stubbed" and I have no interest of reading stubbed stories, for some reason they all lose in quality eventually.

    Of ongoing I 'd recommend:

    **The Years of Apocalypse** was already mentioned here. It's quite readable but follow MoL recipe little too much.

    **The Calamitous Bob** nice isekay/litrpg/kingdom building

    From Nerubian's Jorney author - **Cultist of Cerebon**, It seems to me author improve somewhat.
    ```

    - u/suddenly_lurkers:
      ```
      > The fact that it is one of highest rated stories on RR is border on supernatural.

      The first book is a 4.33, the latest book is a 4.83. Unlike most stories on RR, they split the story up into multiple books that get multiple ratings, so they benefit heavily from selection bias. It's a bit unfair really, since all the people who don't like it rate the first book poorly and then don't rate the rest.
      ```

    - u/Dragongeek:
      ```
      I tried *Cultist of Cerebon* a while ago and bounced off (got to Ch5). Can't exactly put my finger on what it was, but it just wasn't interesting despite the description/tags hitting lots of my interests.
      ```

      - u/serge_cell:
        ```
        It's completely slice of life so far, no saving the world, uncovering grand conspiracy or struggling with deadly curse. There is only some of cult building. May be no overarching plot turn you off.
        ```

  - u/Darkpiplumon:
    ```
    Out of curiosity (and better recommendations), what did you dislike about Journey of Black and Red? If it's just the general vibes/style, I wouldn't recommend Calamitous Bob or Changeling, from the same author. Pale Lights has always been one 10k ish chapter a week, so I wouldn't say it posts infrequently

    To be honest, most of RR is long and uncompleted mediocre System Litrpg progression stuff. You can read it if you like it, but it's not great, and most of the great stuff you've already mentioned.

    Edit: I wrote a couple of recommendations here, but apparently reddit deleted it. And I can't be bothered to write them again :(

    I gave [Dungeon Diver](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/64223/dungeon-diver-stealing-a-monsters-power) a try based on a rec from a self-admitted popcorn enthusiast.

    It...was not good. I want to ramble on about bits I found generic, but I'm really not familiar with the genre. Suffice to say it felt like the systems and the characters both existed in service of letting the MC's numbers go up. Weirdly compelling, mind you, but completely opposed to what I'd (like to) say I enjoy in a story.

    I don't know what fraction I read, but I'm sure there was a lot more where that came from. I would be willing to bet money that it stuck with its formula.

      Oof, 3.5~ stars on royalroad means it is garbage. And not the normal level of garbage either, basically the absolute bottom tier of writing on the internet.


      Honestly, I'll recommend my simple system for sorting through royalroad. If the overall rating is below 4.3~ or so, don't even read it. If it's above, you can give it a chance. I've read a lot of books on royalroad and have never once seen a single good book that had a score below 4.3. If there is one thing I can say, reviewers on royalroad are very consistent at not tolerating shit-tier writing that is prevalent in a lot of web fiction.

    Bioshifter from the same author of Vigor Mortis takes the stuff that made VM and another work from the same author, Hive Minds Give Good Hugs, good, and tries to lessen the worst parts of both.

  - u/Background_Relief815:

    I also just finished Chasing Sunlight, and honestly had the same reaction. It was a rare treat of not really being progression fiction (or, perhaps only being progression fiction in the way many fantasy or sci-fi books were 20 years ago before it was a defined genre), but still being something I enjoyed immensely. By the end of the midpoint (if that makes any sense) it became a little predictable in that >!at every location we're shown, something will go wrong there, usually catastrophically wrong that completely changes a part of the world that the author has told us has been here for a very long time!<. Other than that, I thought I was reading one of my favorite RR authors, and it was only after I had finished and looked at his other works I realized it was the author of Paranoid Mage. 

    Paranoid Mage was...fine. In some ways it was what someone without a firm grasp of what we like here in /rational would write if they were trying to write something we would write. The protagonist does a lot of rational things.  By the end, some of the Antagonists do too, but by then it's too little and too late, because they didn't start off being very smart, and the protagonist is a special snowflake with special snowflake powers that are OP. All complaining aside, I finished it, and it wasn't even my least favorite story that I finished (or am still reading). It has a page-turner quality (much like Ready Player One, but not as strong) that kept me coming back and wanting to see what happened next. If you literally are out of things that you really want to read, it's worth looking at and seeing if it's your cup of tea.

It's a mystery with a lot of cool world building and interesting characters. But it's not finished and it's really long. I've seen people compare it to Umineki but since I haven't read Umineko I have no idea what that means. 

    Everything else I read is progressive fiction.

      I like mystery books as much as the next guy, but 1 million+ words of mystery is a bit too much. I just kind of dropped this novel after the first couple hundred thousand words. Pacing needs serious improvement, first 300-400k words only cover like a day in the story.

      I read this one, up to wherever it had finished several months back. I liked it, but it moves veeeery slowly. And I keep feeling like I'm having the rug pulled out from under my feet because from the beginning it was advertised as a time loop story, but (up to where I had read) there was absolutely no time looping and just some cryptic references to it.  


       I feel like it does a disservice to the story to let readers know from the start that time looping is in effect but then never using that Chekhov's Gun. I kept expecting a revelation of "ah, so THIS is where the time loop gets revealed!" but it just never happened. It's tough to speculate about what is really going on when you know there's a huge looking plot point that could be actually to blame. I feel like the time loop either needed to be woven into the mystery all throughout, or it should have been removed as part of the plot. Also, I totally get the Umineko references, as the story is a "who done it" murder mystery, but there's a big looking plot point that makes theorizing frustrating, since the answer could always be "magic/time loop."


       Anyway, I should get back to it. Despite my complaints, it was a very good story

    All ongoing:

    **Delve** - Isekai "system" progression fantasy, which is a bit cliche but I find compelling, especially the start, as the mc is transported into a world where he can't speak the language, doesn't know the customs, and has to work out a build based on little information about how it works, ending up on a very unconventional one. Does dip a little hard into number crunching and esoteric soul stuff at times

    **RE: Trailer Trash** - This is a grounded character focused piece about a woman getting the chance to go back mentally to when she was a kid and change the course of her dead-end life

    **Blood and Fur** - A very dark story by the same author as *The Perfect Run* about a word where Aztac mythology is real and the protagonist is chosen to be a sort of symbolic sacrificial emperor for a year before being harvested by the demonic entities that really run the empire, and has to do everything in his power to undermine and overthrow them

  This week I've got two:

  ***
  ***[Changeling](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/75345/changeling)*** by Mecanimus.

  Overall, rather positive. 

  In short, it's basically a "post-system apocalypse" story with a "soft" system (no blue boxes, more like cultivation) and randomly spawning dungeon dimensions. The "twist" is that it takes place a bit into the future, where technology has progressed to the point where military levels of wealth can use cybernetic augmentation and power armor/weapons to make regular Joe soldier into a fair match for a low/mid grade powered individual (who are incompatible with cybernetics). 

  Besides combat, a major focus is on "Gleam" (powered individual) politics and how society has adjusted to account for literal superhumans and generally is always on a war footing against dungeon breaks and random kaiju interrupt. Interesting stuff, as the author does a lot of worldbuilding on how to create an ostensibly fair, just, and "good" society when there is this superhuman stratification present. 

  The protagonist, Nestra, is a failed Gleam: born to a powered family but not inheriting for some reason (no spoilers) yet she eventually discovers a power she has and this story is about her growing it (the title should be a major hint as to what it is). 

  Mecanimus is the same author of *A Journey of Black and Red* which I thought was pretty good, and generally an author who I "trust to deliver" as in that series there are multiple published works with audiobooks etc. Also generally just delivers solid writing. In terms of storytelling, there is a strong sense of parallelism between *A Journey of Black and Red* and *Changeling*; specifically, the protagonist's traits and struggles hit upon many similar or straight-up the same Themes and story beats. 

  The only negatives that I can point out are probably (1) the story occasionally has what I feel are too many fight sequences, where multiple pages could be summed up to "Nestra does a dungeon run and kills all the monsters" and (2) the supporting and secondary cast of characters is a bit weak, particularly in the beginning, although this may just be a function of the protagonist being rather anti-social. 

  ***
  [***Shards of Honor***](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61903.Shards_of_Honour) by Lois McMaster Bujold

  I figured that I can't call myself a sci-fi fan if I haven't covered some classics and since I had a couple three hour drives, I got the audiobook and had a listen. 

  Overall, fine sci-fi. Nothing that really blew me away, but several rather good moments. Here, the science fiction is more of just a setting than an actual plot device--the core story is about action, heroics, psychology and a (surprising amount) of romance. Despite this, it's not a "teen" novel in the sense that, despite the romance aspect, the main protagonists are still competent adults who owe and honor allegiance to, for example, the war effort. 

  That said, this book more than most of the other stuff I read, had me feeling like I was taking a look in the author's head more than most. Here are some themes:

  - Romance: This isn't a genre I read often, or at all really, yet it is probably the main theme of the book. I felt rather clearly that I was not the target audience for it, it feels rather aimed at a female readership with a lighter touch of the tropes that can be seen on full display on ao3. 

  - Rape: You know that feeling when you are reading something, and you can just tell that the author also writes erotica or wishes they were? The amount of times where the protagonist is either threatened with rape or almost raped in this story isn't extremely high, but high enough to the point where I'd usually suspect that this might be the author's kink. Maybe a false positive and my "squick detector" is just tuned too finely, or maybe it's just not something that I, as a male, have a lot of lived experience with. Dunno.

  - Therapy is the enemy: A major arc near the end of the book is basically the classical "mental institution nightmare" where therapists try to therapize the protagonist using increasingly unethical means justified as being for her own good, and not listening to her when she tells them the truth from her perspective. This part is extremely frustrating to read for me, as it is not only very scary, but also drifts to the point where I get the feeling that the author has a bone to pick with psychologists. 

  To those of you who've read more of Bujold's works, thoughts?

    Spoilers for themes of Bujold's works:

    >!Coercive sex and sexual torture are major themes of the early Vorkosigan books.  Shards of Honor is more intense than average; I'd say it's the second most extreme, after Mirror Dance.  More typically there's sexual violence happening off-camera or implicitly in the setting: Barrayar, The Vor Game, Borders of Infinity, and Labyrinth all fit this pattern.  But there's a radical trend break after Mirror Dance, the amount of noncon falls to background levels and stays there (though Komarr is unsettling in a related way).!<

    >!Having said all that, even early Bujold had other interests; I can't think of any noncon in Mountains of Mourning, Brothers in Arms, Cetaganda, or Ethan of Athos.!<

    >!The other thing I'd say about Shards of Honor specifically is that it's Bujold's first book, and pretty clumsily written by her standards.!<

    As for "therapy is the enemy", I think >!that's just that one incident in Shards of Honor.  Even in that book Cordelia's experiences are unusual; when she's flying back to Beta Colony she muses that she'd really like some therapy, clearly expecting something other than what she got.  Betan therapy is presented in a positive light everywhere else I can think of!<

    Romance: >!Most of Bujold's stories have a romantic subplot: two people getting together, or reconciling, or at least kindling the tentative hints of something.  Usually it goes well, sometimes terribly.!<

    If you want to try some Bujold where the science fiction concepts are more central, consider Falling Free or Ethan of Athos.

    I've read Curse of Chalion and the first few Penric novellas, and they were are all really good. She's an amazing writer. I haven't tried her sci-fi works because I don't like sci-fi.

    I don't know about a rape kink, but she definitely likes younger women with older men. Which is a pro in my book, older men are hot. There needs to be more hot old men in web novels in general. It's very obvious in The Sharing Knife. It also happens in Curse of Chalion.

    Edit: 
    To go into a bit more detail. Penric is the closest that I've read in any western novel that comes close to the atmosphere from Japanese SoL. Penric is an incredibly nice guy, and I love his dynamic with Desdemona, and I like how the plot is usually light hearted even if there's a >!few attempts on his life sometimes.!<

    Curse of Chalion on the other hand while it isn't the opposite, is very different. The MC is practically the definition of a woobie, and he has a rough time as the book goes on. But it's enjoyable too. There's a big religious aspect to the world building which I really enjoyed. >!MC himself becomes something of a saint at some point,!< more to his chagrin than anything else, and I loved his interactions with the priests of various gods. In the end it all ties together pretty well too. I liked reading it, but it was bit too dark for me.

    I've read the vast majority of Bujold's books.  Mostly agree on Shards, and I'd consider it one of the weaker entries in the Vorkosigan series.  It's one of the first books she wrote, and she had a lot of room for growth.  The immediate followup, Barrayar, was written later and is significantly better.  (The other two early weak entries are The Warrior's Apprentice and Ethan of Athos, the latter of which is very skippable.)

    Bujold does enjoy writing romance, and her later series The Sharing Knife is essentially just fantasy romance, but the rest of the Vorkosigan series doesn't typically go there as heavily as in Shards.  A Civil Campaign is probably the closest, but that book is so great for so many reasons.  Falling Free also has a decent amount, and one of the more recent ones does too iirc.

    I don't recall exactly how the scenes you're discussing went in this book (re: threats of rape), but she doesn't dip back into that well as much in future books.  Though there's certainly some of it, and I'm sure not all well-handled.  Some of what happened in this book gets revisited later in a way that makes story and thematic sense.  For what it's worth, I never got the sense any of this was a kink thing--it felt more like something she felt needed to be included thematically.  There were far fewer women scifi authors when she started out, and I think she felt a woman's perspective here was important vs pulp scifi tropes, if that makes sense.

    Regarding therapy, it rarely comes up in later books, and is sometimes handled better, but sometimes not.  A major character with a traumatic past gets therapy and Cordelia is strongly in favor and it helps him a lot.  Another major character avoids therapy because he fears he'd be stuck in it forever or discharged from the military or something, I only vaguely remember this minor plot bit and I don't think it was especially clear.

    Bujold has such an entertaining and lovely writing style--once she gets going properly--that I definitely recommend at least trying out the next book, Barrayar.  Her fantasy series starting with Curse of Chalion is also very good, though has a bit more romance than you might like.  She has a series of novellas set in that same fantasy world that follow their own storyline (with less romance), starting with Penric's Demon, which are excellent and breezy.  I wouldn't really recommend the Sharing Knife, wasn't a big fan.

      >There's something of a tonal mismatch between the grim cyberpunk start

      Interesting observation. I don't really agree that the setting is "grim cyberpunk" though, but that may just be a matter of perspective. For me, "grim cyberpunk" means that there's a specific mix of futility, "no-future vibes", and dysfunction at every level like you'd see in something like the Cyberpunk 2077 setting. 

      The Changeling setting really isn't like this at all. While yes, it's not an idylic paradise: violence and danger lurk around the corner, there's a big disparity in class due to the superhumans and their wealth, and large portions of the outside world have descended into outright savagery, within the city it's not *that* bad. There is a functional and reasonably powerful goverment that's for-the-people-by-the-people which keeps the corporations in check and wields quite a big stick. Murders get investigated, community-focused policing happens, and a the framework of law is powerful enough to put powerful people in prison. Additionally, in sense of "vibes" the whole thing has a rather future-postive outlook: the perspective of the people is that the great apocalyptic gauntlet was defeated at enormous cost, yet humanity pervailed and is now growing, struggling, but winning and gaining in capability and the capacity to innovate. 

      That said, I agree about the dungeon crawling starting to feel dull. Just endless fight sequences with no real meaningful growth.

  I read [*Rabbit Test*](https://www.uncannymagazine.com/article/rabbit-test/) by Samantha Mills, and quite enjoyed it. It's a short story that was written in 2022 about the reversal of Roe, in a country that controls women's reproductive rights. It's contrasted with historical examples of the availability of abortifacients, and how abortion has always been "two steps forward, one step back, then maybe another step back."

  It's barely 7000 words, but very well-written. You can feel the anxiety of the women as they consider not just their option, but the *availability* of their potions, the oppression of the system that monitors them to make ensure "the rights of the unborn" while violating their basic rights.

  I will add that it was a 2023 Hugo winner (best short story). There is a ton of controversy around what happened last year that I won't get into, and the author has publicly stated she doesn't fully consider herself a Hugo award winner and has removed all mention of it from her bio. It's still a really good read, so just ignore that I guess.

    I just read it and it was a drag, all that perspective jumping really hurts the idea by duliting the impact


    Funnily enough that reminded me of a GRMM short story (Slideshow, i think?) where some dude is trying to gather funds for space travel, he looks at another guy trying to gather funds to combat hunger, by presenting pictures of lots of hungry kids in africa, and thinks how the story of a single kid packs more emotional punch that such mess of a slideshow


    More so, i read the hentai Emergence years ago, about a girl being destroyed by society vía sexual degradation, and thats the kind of story you never forget, while Rabbit Test is too on the nose and generalistic despite having simmilar topics


    Having a character thats already trying to fulfill their plans, has more impact when those plans are destroyed, thats why Emergence is so memorable while Rabbit Test will fade out from memory among the other protests framed in the same way 



    I say RT is a story that suffers from trying to be a movie, time framing is simmilar and the descriptions are so vague they are obviously banking on the reader already being familiar with them, or the production covering that part


    You know what? As much as we say internet fiction tends to be anime-like, "real intelectual" fiction has the same problem, but with "real intelectual" movies


    Also, the lack of scifi stuff other than for repression made it feel more of a pulp story



    Actually, it reminds me of old scifi that focused on ideas over characters, but using stuff thats common at the moment, instead of exploring the truly strange ramifications



    Yeah, the scifi was an excuse, not a goal, thats why it felt so samey



    Just go and read Emergence to see how greatly  a genre can work when the genre is crucial to the story , instead of an add-on

    Winners like this are why I don't consider Hugo awards past 2010 or so to be a valuable signal of quality. 

    I'm also not a fan of the rapid POV shifts, but other than that the writing is fine. The number of $CURRENT_YEAR identity politics topics jammed into 7,000 words is remarkable though. Off the top of my head there was climate change, trans issues, slavery, race issues, gay marriage... It's basically everything but the kitchen sink.

    There was also a pretty egregious historical distortion when they decided to tie white nationalism to anti-abortion advocacy through the protagonist's mother, while whitewashing how birth control and abortion advocacy were historically associated with eugenics.  A great example of this is Margaret Sanger, the founder of Planned Parenthood, a key historical figure who strangely did not merit an anecdote. The piece would have been more compelling if the author had grappled with how reproductive issues have not always been aligned with the other social justice causes mentioned in the piece, rather than presenting it in a simplistic "the arc of history bends towards justice" sort of way.

    Fundamentally though this is clear and unabashed political advocacy. Maybe it technically qualifies as speculative fiction under a generous definition, but it's absolutely not what I would expect upon picking up something that was nominated for (let alone won) a Hugo.
