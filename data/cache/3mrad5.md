  Since it's been six months since this was last posted on the subreddit, I'm reposting it for anyone new to the community.

  What do people think about adding this resource to the sidebar?

    People are voting the antimemetics stories significantly lower than five stars, so this website is clearly the spawn of Roko and should be purged with fire.

  You really need a way to separate out paid and free fiction.  The paid fiction should say "paid" somewhere where it can be seen on the page and all searches should provide the opportunity to select paid or unpaid or both.

  Also, you need a way to filter out nonfiction.

    I'll see what we can do.

    We already have an option for fiction or non-fiction. If you want to filter out non-fiction, I recommend selecting fiction. Everything has one or the other tag
