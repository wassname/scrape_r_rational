  Happy to see this updated. I remember liking this one quite a bit.

    Likewise. I may need to do a reread to refresh my memory.

  *Of course* I start reading this right when the latest chapter ends on a big fat cliffhanger. This always seems to happen to me.

  [Spoilers](#s "Anybody have guesses on the initials in the notes? I only recognize the obvious ones: Ollivander, Nymphadora Tonks, Peter Pettigrew, Tom Riddle, and Albus Dumbledore. I'm pretty sure YH is Young Hermione. That leaves TT, TD, and DR. The only names I could find that fit are Ted Tonks, Tracey Davis, and Demelza Robins, but they seem extremely unlikely (especially Robins, since until now I thought she was an OC in another fic I'm reading).")

    [Spoiler](#s " DR = Daniel Radcliffe")

      Lol!  I like to lean on the fourth wall occasionally, but I don't think I'd go quite that far.

    Mix of British and US spelling.

      Darn, thought I caught all those, thanks!

    I'm *always* a bit worried.  Imposter Syndrome and all that.

  I was not expecting a Peggy Sue.  Interesting.
  ```

  - u/RobinDrew:
    ```
    [-Spoiler if Peggy Sues worry you, otherwise just wait-](#s "The "Traveler" is not going to stick around very long - the story has always been intended to be about Hermione learning and growing, which can't really happen if she's replaced with someone who has already done that, or even gets "cheat codes" from her.")

    Mostly it's just because I felt compelled to *justify* my divergence from canon.  Which many people have told me isn't necessary (lots even said just make Tonks a Seventh Year like EY did), but I'm a fan of both continuity and "Hard Fantasy", if you will.

      Hey, Peggy Sue's can be interesting.  [And They Shall Reap the Whirlwind](http://otherhistory.proboards.com/thread/431/shall-reap-whirlwind) is a long, and occasionally very bizarre, Peggy Sue involving an actual historical figure whose mind gets fed to and replaced by the mind of a 21st-century historian whose career was studying that specific person.  (Arthur Harris, commander in chief of the British bomber command in WW2)

      The story is amusing in places because almost none of the replacement's attempts to peggy sue the shit out of everything actually work.  Failures range from frustrating to horrifying, but nothing is really easy for the protagonist in spite of having been dropped into a situation where they can potentially do the most good.  It's a long story, and it does kinda lose the plot from time to time, but it's a good study of how foreknowledge is not an instant-win.

      Your  structure as written has a lot of potential, especially if you keep the perspective centered where it is, making the interloper essentially unknowable and separate.  I think you could be onto something if you plot out everything from the interloper's perspective and only show us things from the current POV.
      ```

  ```
  Twist! Or maybe it's just because I haven't read this story for a while. Great to see an update either way. The plot thickens!
  ```

- u/VanPeer:
  ```
  Excellent writing.
  ```
