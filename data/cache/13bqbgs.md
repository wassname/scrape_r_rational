## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  What follows is just me complaining, and isn't really a recommendation or de-recommendation.

  [The Path of Ascension](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/40920/the-path-of-ascension) has been mentioned here before, and I've been following it. Not so much because it is great literature, but more along the lines of a desire to see what happens.  You know how it is.

  There's been a few chapters here and there that have I have found excessively boring, and I don't quite agree with the author's justification for writing them.

  In the build up to the Minkalla arc / book, there was a chapter devoted to the potential floors the MCs *might* encounter. (Minkalla is a planet-sized dungeon with a randomly-selected themes on each floor.)

  Post Minkalla, there were a couple chapters devoted to skills and items the MCs *might* select as upgrades. Lots and lots of skills.

  Do you all find this more interesting than I do? It displays the inventiveness of the author in thinking up these skills, but only the skills they select will be relevant to plot moving forward.

  I appreciate seeing a character pick up a new skill, and using it in inventive ways to solve a problem, in or out of combat.  But being presented with a long, long list of potential skills isn't nearly so interesting.  And the MCs have so many skills now it is hard to keep track of what they have, and how they might be combined.

  Rant finished.
  ```

  - u/OutOfNiceUsernames:
    ```
    I think the problem is with treating it as part of the main storyline. They are writing notes on the setting, not part of the story itself (regardless of how the writer presents them).

    Consider it from this angle: for the story to not feel superficial, the writer needs to spend a significant amount of computational power on simulating not only what ended up happening directly on-screen, but also some of the things that *might* have been happening. These include the examples you've mentioned: choices that the characters were considering but didn't take, elements of the setting that exist 'out there', etc.

    The writer would have to consider these things regardless of whether they published them in some format linked to the story or not, and those things would eat some of the hours they spend working on the story either way. So in that context, all things being equal anyway, it would be a bonus for the reader to have access to these writing notes rather than not have. The downsides are some extra disk space used by these note-chapters, some inconvenience while navigating through the text of the main story, and perhaps some manipulation of the publishing platform by getting extra index bumps on your story. 

    The upsides are that: 1) those readers who're also interested in the lore get to explore it in more detail.; 2) the notes make the story feel more detailed and 'realistic'; 3) even if a particular reader isn't interested in such notes, they may still end up benefiting from them without even realising it — e.g. if someone else used those notes as a helpful material to either write a fanfiction on that initial title, or to eventually brew a setting / story of their own.

    Some of the caveats are that: 1) it's much more problematic when these notes aren't being clearly distinguished into their own separate chapters, making reading through the main narrative more of a slog, and that 2) if / when the authors use such texts to feign publication of a new actual chapter. But in the latter case an actual chapter would be lacking either way, so those notes aren't competing with actual chapters as much as it would seem.

    Also, content like that being released by a writer may be an indicator that they're treating their readerbase not only as consumers of the created story, but also as contributors, of sort. E.g. some of the readers may come up with an interesting idea while reading those notes and suggest it to the writer, having it eventually get incorporated into the canon setting.

    >the MCs have so many skills now it is hard to keep track of what they have, and how they might be combined

    That's probably an entirely different problem, IMO.

    I don't think The Path of Ascension was one, but this is something I see often from adapted quests, and it also reminds me of anime filler or the shop episodes of Critical Role. Possibly interesting in the same way that reading a Monster Manual can be interesting, but not interesting in the same way that a Monster Manual isn't exactly a compelling narrative.

    The fact that the original Celestial Forge fic [Brockton's Celestial Forge](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/brocktons-celestial-forge-worm-jumpchain.70036/threadmarks) (1.8 million words) is among the top 15 [most popular Worm fics](https://wormstorysearch.com/?direction=desc&is_nsfw_eq=any&limit=20&page=1&searching=true&sort=stories.rating) even though it's very heavy on "power wanking" suggests that a lot of readers like "power wanking". On the other hand, the fact that its pacing has been highly controversial (to the point of becoming a meme) suggests that a lot of people don't like "power wanking".

    It almost makes you wonder if not all readers have the same preferences, but let's not jump to conclusions! /s
    ```

    - u/kraryal:
      ```
      I've read this, and it suffers horribly from the writing trick of the celestial forge. (Which gives the main character a power up per X words written). 

      Describing the power up and how the MC integrates it with his other power ups is enough words to trip a power up... so then the writer starts writing that new power up... and it happens again.

  Yall got any suggestions for communities where I can find webnovel recommendations? I've scoured Top Rated on RR, Topwebfic, stuff above a 4.4 on Novelupdates, etc. Looking for more obscure, high quality works.

  Rational seems to be the closest sub I can find in terms of taste, but whether or not a work is rational isn't especially important for me. I'm also not interested in fanfiction, which really limits the number of relevant recommendations from here.
  ```

  - u/fassina2:
    ```
    This would be helpful for me also. What I've been doing lately is finding reviewers with lots of reviews on goodreads, whose taste are similar to mine, and looking for other books they like. 

    &#x200B;

    Go to a book you particularly enjoy for instance, and look at the reviewers who rate it similarly to you, pick one with lots of reviews and double check if your tastes are similar. If so just scour their reviews for books they liked and you haven't read.
    ```

    - u/CatInAPot:
      ```
      Thanks for the suggestion! I've already been trying to do that with authors, but a lot of the authors I like don't really have a list of books they like that I can find. I'll try some more with reviewers.
      ```

  - u/bildramer:
    ```
    Similar to the other response to your comment: Go to _authors_' pages, e.g. on RR, and see what they have favorited. Often that's just more works in the big cluster of generally good popular works you're most likely already familiar with, but this method can let you find a rare gem or two.
    ```

  - u/Cosmogyre:
    ```
    The [Metaphor](https://metaphor.systems/) search engine is actually kinda good at this, specifically at finding stuff that's hosted on private websites. You have to prompt it in the correct way, like "Here's a link to my favourite time-travel webfiction:", but it can give you results you won't find elsewhere.
    ```

    - u/CatInAPot:

      I actually tried asking ChatGPT for some recommendations, and it was pretty disappointing. Just tried Metaphor and it's already given me a few results that seem quite interesting. Thanks for the suggestion!

    ```
    TVtropes has [fanfic recommendations](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanficRecommendations). Not so much webnovels in general, unless you look for Web originals under specific tropes. A lot of those are completely random quality though so your mileage may vary.
    ```

- u/Krakenarrior:
  ```
  What litRPGs/stories with a system don’t follow the typical D&D stat layout? If you’re unfamiliar, the stats for dungeons and dragons (and almost every RPG that grew from D&D) are Strength (STR), Dexterity (DEX), Constitution (CON), Wisdom (WIS), Intelligence (INT), and Charisma (CHA). 


  Some stories don’t include all of them, or certain stats get added later, like [Ar'Kendrithyst](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26727/arkendrithyst), and others that are slipping my mind right now. 


  What I’m looking for is systems that don’t have any of those stats, like [The Game at Carousel: A Horror Movie LitRPG](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/65629/the-game-at-carousel-a-horror-movie-litrpg) which uses stats such as Grit, Moxie, and Savvy. While these stats can translate into classic D&D, such as Grit to CON, stats like Savvy and Moxie are much tougher to translate. Another example is anything by Macronomicon especially 
  [Industrial Strength Magic](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/57011/industrial-strength-magic). 


  I’m not sure that there’s a plethora of stories that don’t use traditional RPG stats, so if there’s stories that do use the traditional RPG stats, but in a different way, I’m open to checking out those as well.
  ```

  - u/lucidobservor:
    ```
    [The Erogamer](https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/the-erogamer-original-complete.5465/) (NSFW) fits your ask perfectly. I enjoyed it a lot, as did many on this sub, but whether *you* would enjoy it is *very* much a matter of taste. 

    The six main stats in question are:

    * BOD / Body
    * LST / Lust
    * SED / Seduction
    * FUK / Fucking
    * PRV / Perversion
    * ERO / Erogame Logic
    ```

  - u/vegicannibal:
    ```
    [Worth the Candle](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25137/worth-the-candle) has Phy, Men, Soc, and Luck; with the first 3 having subcategories. It doesn't exactly map but is treated similarly to D&D stats. It's the skills and perks that differentiate it more.

    NB: I would not call the rest of the recommendations rational, but I still think they have interesting systems.

    [The Forerunner Initiative](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/65848/the-forerunner-initiative) has something approximating the normal set albeit with a few extra. They have 3 breakdowns for resources though: maximum, regeneration, edge. I quite like how the stats impact on edge, which is effectively a cost reduction on all skill usage and therefore increases the floor as stats increase in a way that lots of systems miss.

    [Path of Ascension](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/40920/the-path-of-ascension) doesn't have numeric stats, it goes by a feel approach and leans more cultivation-y. What I like with here is that as your capabilities grow, you gain the ability to focus on sub-aspects of your stats. E.g. at level 1 you probably allocate to either physical or mana, or a combination, but those are effectively your stats. As you advance you learn to focus on things like enhancing your reflexes, or your proprioception.
    ```

    - u/Krakenarrior:
      ```
      I was thinking Worth the Candle had unique stats but I couldn’t remember.  I guess I also forgot about Path of Ascension but stats there aren’t really the focus because of the main character’s unique talent (or whatever it’s called). 


      I’ll check out The Forerunner Initiative, especially because from what you say it actually uses the stats and they’re not just an afterthought.
      ```

  - u/LockedRoomMystery:
    ```
    [The Sins of Cinnamon](https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/the-sins-of-cinnamon.7774/) (NSFW) has an interesting take on this. Each class has its own attributes, some of which are unique (like the Sword Dancer's Truth stat), while others are common and appear in many classes(like Constitution). Each person in this word has two classes (a class given at birth and a class they earn through a job), so there's potentially to double down on attributes by ensuring overlap or spreading yourself to become better in more areas. 

    Also a very good story. Don't be put off by the NSFW label.
    ```

    - u/jaghataikhan:
      ```
      Thanks for the rec, i really liked the setting of a "standard" DnD esque world that had progressed to a modern tech level (with like phones and cars and stuff) while adventurer skills and magic were part of life too
      ```

  - u/Dragongeek:
    ```
    I mean, I'd still describe *The Wandering Inn* as a "litRPG" even though there aren't any real stats. People just get [skills] instead. For example a warrior archetype might get a skill that increases their strength isntead of STR points when they level up (although reading between the lines, it seems that high-level individuals do benefit from some sort of all-round slight enhancement even without skills). 

    I really like this "system". It's lightweight and I always feel that there are so many wonky edge cases that come up if you try to "play it straight" but use numbers to represent extremely abstract concepts.
    ```

  - u/dogcomplex:
    ```
    [The Daily Grind](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/15925/the-daily-grind) is an excellent example, and one of my general top-tier recommendations (out of like 50 ratfics I've read now).  It's the story of some friends finding a dungeon portal in their real-world office building inhabited by aggressive office supplies.  Defeating them nets very random skills like "+1 Formatting: Times New Roman" but slowly but surely cumulates into somewhat-useful stuff like "+3 History:  Military Tactics" and "Breath Capacity +3min".

    By the end >!they're fairly superhuman (through often odd combinations of powers like "Manipulate Asphalt"), they're finding multiple dungeons in the world, and they're leading an organization of hundreds of humans, machines, and dungeon life to make the world better for all.!<

    Wonderful tone and optimism, despite dealing with some heavy emotional topics.  Very strong at keeping to the knitty-gritty of events and powers and maintaining a nice ascension narrative throughout.  Unfinished, but each "book" is a good stepping-out point to wait on more chapters.  "Office Space" meets "Severance" meets DnD.  And the author really finds their legs after the first book so hold out if it's feeling shaky to you.
    ```

    - u/JanDis42:
      ```
      I loved the earlier books, and still like the world and setting but...

      The way the author is handling politics is really grating to me. In other stories like HFY stories or project hail Mary it is obvious that problems are glossed over or there is at least some justification for competency.

      In daily grind this is not done (well?) and other political beliefs are actively disparaged. The MC >!suffers from depression!< but after an arc where this is actually relevant it has no consequences and does not even influence how he acts.

      In general the story devolves more and more into >!UBI good, humans all nice, police bad, government bad!< which I do not even disagree with fully but it's overbearing. Which annoys me doubly because the setting is fantastic.
      ```

      - u/dogcomplex:
        ```
        So - I get this take, and as someone who ultimately highly agrees with the author's political stances in the end I'm not sure I can really say anything without bias here.  If you're looking for grittier views to get more pull, this isn't the fic for it.   But I disagree that the lack of those is bad writing in any way.

        What this fic is - is fantasy.  Escapism.  What if you discovered a way to get near-limitless resources - how would you change the world?  And from that premise forward - I dunno, pretty accurate imo.  >!The main character was indeed a depressed mess - and may not have even lived this long without finding this strange source of hope, and ability to live the way he actually wants to rather than conform to a broken system (which is like... a very fuckin likely cause of depression to begin with, which the fic thoroughly argues).!<  Otherwise - the fic is optimistic about one thing, which readers are free to disagree with (but personally highly speaks to me):  when you have a massive surplus of resources, and can brute-force many of the problems of modern scarcity-based society, then that can do quite a lot towards improving "human nature" too.  When there's plenty to go around, it's quite a lot easier to get along - whodda thunk?

        I don't think the author is entirely blind to the "real world" either though, or the consequences of such naive politics - >!hell, in one chapter like 1/4 of the characters are killed off from a counterattack by an enemy they could have wiped out when they had the chance but were naively merciful.  Way dark.!<  But strong choice by the author imo to bring those elements in - and I hope the forces lined against the main group get grittier and more realistic as it goes.  I'm enjoying every compromise they have to endure with e.g. >!greedy rich psychopath alchemists, monstrous dungeon life, or emotionless battle-hardened mercenary units!< \- there's a place for all of them in a post-scarcity society, and it's strong writing to incorporate those all yet still and try and keep this burgeoning society on a mostly "Neutral-to-Chaotic Good" Paladin-style morality as it goes.

        None of that's possible without the surplus though.  This would be a tragedy if the same were attempted without it - as the system squeezes in and crushes all, yet again.  But also - best believe even with those kinds of power boosters in play, any group's upward mobility is going to be challenged hard by the status quo.  The world is a power balance, and while this fic writes in a few glaring cheats (resource surplus, >!dungeon-caused muddling of top-down organization so their group is not squashed immediately!<), it otherwise plays the spirit and facts of modern world politics pretty fairly imo.  It's a lot easier to criticize a system when you have the wealth and resources to create an entirely new, potentially better one.  But **if** you have those resources - which is the fantasy here - you best damn-well use them to create a better world.  Like Alanna says, its the responsibility of people with power to use it for good.  This fic gets preachy - but it's needed preach, and highly enjoyable.

        Hey! Sorry for the very-late reply.  I'll try and do a comprehensive recommendation post one of these weeks, but in the meantime - a few other fics that are (just a tiny bit) off the beaten path that I'd highly recommend:

        \- [The Gods Are Bastards](https://tiraas.net/) \- Probably my favorite rational-ish fic of all.  There's a level of worldbuilding complexity and character/system/society understanding to the author that makes me just want to bow down in praise - but it's also written with such humor and fun that the complexity isn't overwhelming and you dont feel left behind.  For what is ostensibly a fictional Magic School fic, you really do get an education in how the world works, and I love it.  Caveats to the picky readers: this is an incredibly long series, and miraculously it's not even finished yet - and it's been sitting on the precipice of what will probably be the last book for a couple years now.  This is actually kinda fine to me - the world has been so fleshed out you can imagine your own conclusion.  But I still look forward to the day the author comes back to finish it - but not before (s)he finishes writing:

        \- [Only Villains Do That](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/40182/only-villains-do-that) \- Which somehow I love even more?  It's still fairly early days (I'm feeling maybe 1/4-1/3rd of the story?) but just such an enjoyable romp deconstructing the classic Isekai format from the character perspective of the "dark lord" role.  Once again, top-notch worldbuilding explored with humor and great characters.  A fic about mostly-ethical world domination (mostly through Healing and Incinerate spells) that nobody asked for but we so needed.

        \- [12 Miles Below](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/42367/12-miles-below) \- It's been a while since I caught up with this fic (which is still in writing, around maybe 2/3rds-3/4s of the way I wager) but I can't wait to binge the new chapters.  Hard to describe my love of this one - I think it ultimately derives from the main character's personality, just upbeat and curious in an utterly hostile environment, solving problems through wit.  The way the mystery of the world is unpacked through his eyes and wizard-style solutions to problems really feels earned - and often comes with epic battles that feel well-crafted and visually visceral.  This fic feels like a new genre being created, with very unique worldbuilding (fantasy underpinned by sci-fi?), and I look forward to where it goes.

        (These, of course, assume you've already read a good deal of Alexander Wales' fics (any, really) and Wildbow's Worm series - which are front and center around here for a reason, and not at all off the beaten path. )

        - u/LaziIy:
          ```
          Np, I appreciate the reply! I guess I've ventured far enough the beaten path to have read these recommendations. I'll wait for your eventual comprehensive post to see if I can find any uncovered gems.

    [The Way Ahead](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/42202/the-way-ahead) takes the approach of letting almost anything be a stat if your build is customized that way. But skill levels matter more than stats in that story. It has some amazing ideas and really cool world but the protagonist himself is a sadsack which doesn't help much. 

    Similarly, [Ends of Magic: Antimage](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/57697/ends-of-magic-antimage-litrpg?sorting=newest) has a skill based system that gives stats based on your class and skills. Some cool ideas, although this is more of an action story than a character based one.

  ```
  Any reincarnation fics where the protagonist actually acts their age? As in if the protagonist was reincarnated at age X they act as if they're age X after reincarnation as well. Looking for something character focused that really dives into the alienation you'd feel from peers of your age group, and how the protagonist deals with being an adult in a kid's body and life. Munchkining powers and becoming OP is acceptable as long as the characterization is good. Fanfics are also fine. 

  The only story I read that does that consistently is Re:Monarch. A lot of the other stories that do reincarnation either make the protagonist start acting their current age (in which case the reincarnation feels unnecessary) or have them oscillate between plot-convenient bouts of childishness and maturity, which also doesn't feel good. I guess I'm looking for a fic where the protagonist starts off with an adult's wisdom?

      I'd consider it quite good. I enjoyed it more than Mother of Learning. It's like a combination of Mother of Learning and Re:Zero, with the protagonist getting new savepoints seemingly arbitrarily. It definitely has better characterization, although the protagonist and antagonists are less rational. There's some awkwardness with the main characters acting like adults while being low-teens, but it could be chalked up to them having traumatizing childhoods (protagonist as well). There are some pacing problems with the latter arcs, with one in particular going on for too long. But overall it was a very enjoyable, if a bit harrowing, experience.

    - u/jaghataikhan:

    Maybe this one: https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10264082/1/What-Doesn-t-Kill-You It's a plot point early on that the reincarnated protagonist doesn't act age-appropriate which freaks out the people around.

    In terms of overall quality, this is the best modern-person-reincarnated-into-Naruto story that I've read (out of 5 or so), but don't expect a rationalist story. It's also unfortunately incomplete.

    You can try [The Mech Touch](https://novelbin.net/n/the-mech-touch/chapter-1). It's a litrpg in a futuristic setting where mechs dominate warfare, about an underachieving mech designer who he gets a hold of a hyper-advanced "system" type deal. I personally didn't much care for it as I'm really anal about verisimilitude and I couldn't get over some stuff in the worldbuilding, and even then I read quite a few chapters. If you're not like that then it's exactly what you're looking for, I think. 

    Oh, you can find some epubs rips if you look around all the likely sites, e.g. [zlib](https://www.reddit.com/r/zlibrary/comments/zx6z62/megathread_how_to_access_zlibrary_on_tor_app/)(fuck webnovel.com!).

Spoilered bc looking at it now it’s maybe a bit mean, but these are my honest thoughts. >!The narration is just so matter-of-fact, dry, bloodless, robotic, schizoid. Orwell said something about writing prose like a clear window; Wales’ prose is a grayscale filter. It actively leeches any enjoyment out of the characters, setting, story, etc. Only, in Thresholder there wasn’t much to leech! I felt maybe a glimmer of interest in the first Adversary and Wesley; ultimately I couldn’t care less about any of them. Protagonist and Ally grew actively unpleasant to read about. I kept waiting to be “hooked” and just gave up eventually. I remember scrolling down and being baffled at positive comments; I hypothesize the 80% who didn’t like it already dropped it by that point. In their lieu I will vent my frustrations; I hope you can forgive me.!<

  >!The authorial voice is just so exhausting. It was exhausting back in Worth the Candle, though I believe it worked well with its artistic vision. It fit Juniper’s character. It also worked in Eager Readers in Your Area (the best I’ve read of AW’s work) where that lifeless and depressing narration made perfect sense in its setting (the real world) and its viewpoint character (which, by the way, gorgeous character work in this one). It made for great contrast against her coping mechanism and the plot of the short story, and I also believed it worked so well precisely because it was that, short, and it didn’t have the time to psychically drain your soul energy. I kept on believing this was an intentional narrative technique where the narration is colored by the viewpoint character’s perspective (free indirect discourse for the curious) a good bit into TUTBAD (I had Alfric totally clocked as autistic), whereupon a non-Alfric chapter abruptly made me realize, no, I guess that’s just how AW writes everything. Is that how he sees the world? Does he go through life like this? I can hardly believe it; if it were me I wouldn’t be functional.!<

  >!The narration is so detached that it feels as if it was written by a reader, not a writer. Does that make sense? It’s like he’s vivisecting the story as he writes it and we get the cadaver.!<

  >!And I’d hazard to say he’s excellent at that - at dissecting, reading; his blog posts show a good level of insight into the mechanics of genre, worldbuilding, and plot. And that was unmistakably necessary to write something like Worth the Candle! But it doesn’t always make him a good writer, and by god does he have his misses.!<

  >!Wales is all Apollonian, leave the Dionysisan. He suffers from an excess of reason. And I love art that’s usually criticized as “all head, no heart!” Metaphysical poetry, Tom Stoppard, etc. I genuinely enjoy! But even I have my limits.!<

  I still love Eager Readers, which is one of the best web-published short stories I’ve ever read, and Worth the Cradle is a Great Work™. But holy shit I could not slog through TUTBAD, and Thresholder straight up sucks.

  Edit: I forgot to mention that it was written for Writeathon, so maybe I should be kinder to it. >!Well, let me say, I understand it was written under painful constraints, and I hope to god it was painful to write. I hope it did not come naturally. I hope that AW’s natural pen is slow and methodical, and this time it was contorted into a form unsuited for it. I hope that he was playing with his weaknesses, not to his strengths.!< And sorry for being a bit mean :(

    I'm surprised by your comments on TUTBAD (never got into Thresholder) but I guess it's a case of incompatibility between writer and reader. FWIW I've never felt the narration in any of AWs works to be 'detached', or in any way draining, and TUTBAD specifically was impressive to me in how with only a couple of sentences i would know who the chapter was about, purely from the vibe of the narration.

    But I guess I can kiiinda see what you're pointing towards? The narration in TUTBAD is pretty brief when talking about anything that isn't useful for exposing the current characters state of mind. I like that it leaves that space for the characters, but I suppose it is distinctive.

      That’s entirely possible! Of course, from my perspective I’m more likely to say that AW has found here the precise group of readers compatible with him, but there’s nothing wrong with a distinctive and polarizing style. It’s probably much better to have 100 people love your work rather than 1000 people mildly like it!  I’m just disappointed I’m not in that 100 I guess.

      And it’s been a while since I dropped TUTBAD (then picked it up again, and dropped it again) but I remember that exact “expositing the current character’s state of mind,” which I did not like. I was being told all this about characters and I had no reason to like them or care? All these thoughts being unspooled and I didn’t feel that my attention was earned. The recitation of minutiae of memory and reasoning of characters just wore on me quick. And yeah it felt like I was being told about these characters instead of naturally discovering and inferring things about them. The characterization read like exposition. Actually that’s a good way to put it, the whole thing felt like an author expositing at me, I couldn’t immerse myself. I would say that AW is unsuited to slice-of-life but it sounds like other people liked it a lot so more likely it’s just a reader/writer mismatch like you say.

      Edit: and let me be clear AW is absolutely a better writer than 99% of webfic authors. This is just me being picky.

    I noticed the style but it doesn't bother me at all. I like all three mentioned works.

    I am curious enough to ask: what short story do you think best illustrates the sort of prose you are fond of?

    (There is a *lot* of fiction for which I have or could have asked of myself if the author really sees the world the way they write it, and shake my head about how insane that must be if so. Wales' writing is not on that list.)

      I enjoy a lot of different stuff. For prose that is lucid but not artless, I’d point to A Perfect Day for Bananafish, or Ted Chiang’s stuff. For a little more artistry and fancy, look to Borges, or Invisible Cities. And with a little sacrifice of ease of reading, I really really enjoy the masterfully wrought language found in Moby-Dick, Hydriotaphia, and Hawthorne’s short stories like Rappaccini’s Daughter, Young Goodman Brown, and The Birth-mark. I think the only thing matching Wales’s style is probably DFW, but he did it deliberately, and he was horribly depressed!

    I completely skipped the first arc after several first chapters. It was chore to read (not unlike long ladder arc in WtC) and I skiped to the final, seems losing nothing. Second arc seems more involving for me so far.

  Looking for some PC/console games recs following the mobile game recs from last week. 

  Because I don't want to spend all my time in one game for incremental progress, the games need to be completable in <20 hours. No match-based games, sorry.

  So far the only games I've played that qualify are INSIDE and Katana Zero.
  ```

    TUNIC has the best exploration based gameplay I've seen in a game, I think most people in this sub would probably enjoy it despite the narrative being secondary. The game is made to make you feel like a kid that can't really read the rulebook figuring out a new game and pulls it off amazingly well.

    I played Outer Wilds after seeing it recommended on here before. It has a similar exploration focus and I think comes in <20hrs. Its basically a huge archeological puzzle game where you explore a solar system and piece together lore to figure out how to progress.

    I enjoyed Baba Is You. It's a block pushing puzzle game where the rules of the game are blocks you can push around. I got an ending about 10 hours in, and it took me 35 hours to 100%.
    ```

  - u/megazver:
    ```
    That is an insanely broad category - PC games under 20 hours long. 

    Well, Disco Elysium is about 20ish hours to beat and it's one of the best games of all time. It actually made it to number 1 on the [PC Gamer's latest Top 100 Games of All Time list](https://www.pcgamer.com/the-top-100-pc-games-2022/). 

    I think I'll also drop personal recs for Unavowed, The Forgotten City and West of Loathing and/or Shadows Over Loathing.

    Finally, this is a solid list to start with:

    Strong rec. for Outer Wilds.

      Seconded.

  - u/DangerouslyUnstable:
    ```
    The Talos Principle is a puzzle game about what it means to be alive, what has meaning, and what is important. It's both a fantastic puzzle game and fantastic story, it is 20 (ish) hours to beat, especially if you don't particularly care about 100% completionism

    Also, if we are having a thread about Video games: I _loved_ Horizon: Zero Dawn (you loved an  immensly popular award winning game? Shocker), but I mostly cared about the story. Slowly having the backstory of the world revealed was one of the most rewarding video game experiences I've ever had (maybe not surprisingly: Talos Principle has a similar-ish feel as far as how the story is revealed). Does anyone have any recommendations for games that are similar in that one respoect? The gameplay etc. was....fine, but not even close to the main reason I loved H:ZD and I'd love to find more games with similar story elements (or an equally good story told in similar ways, not necessarily a similar story)

  Requesting any uplift/isekai stories. Any setting is fine.

  I've read [A Farmer's Tale](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-farmers-tale-asoiaf.608353/) which is sadly dead, and Castle Kingside which is on a long hiatus. I'd prefer something like those two.
