  For anyone who's curious, I got this due to being on CFAR's mailing list.

    Amusing thought the idea might be, I'm not going to say that falsifying data for a scientific paper means you're writing rational fiction.

    Let's try to keep posts on-topic!

    Replying here rather than on the /r/skeptic crosspost.  FULL CYNICISM MODE, ENGAGE.

    Personally, when I realized I'd blundered my fucking way into an empirical MSc project, I tried to learn statistics.  So I ended up taking undergrad Stats 1 and postgrad Machine Learning 1+2ish, and self-learning Bayesian Stats 1.  I'm currently, ever so slowly, making progress on Computational Bayesian Stats and, some day, will manage to work through Jaynes' *Probability Theory* and actually get the fucking point.

    Now, what does that avail me in my actual research?  *Jack shit.*  How do I actually identify a significant result?  *However my advisor told me to*, which seemed to primarily involve some very frequentist data-analysis methods he'd picked up over the ages.  Did my results really mean all that much?  *No.*

    What methods do I really suggest?  *What your conference/journal editors like.*

    Of course, I was in computer science, which is *unusual* for its widespread ignorance of and failure to care about statistical rigor in empirical research.

  This is why having multiple studies and multiple teams replicating studies is important.
