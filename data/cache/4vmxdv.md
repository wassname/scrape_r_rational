## [D] Monday General Rationality Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics!  Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world?  Have you:

* Seen something interesting on /r/science?
* Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
* Figured out how to become immortal?
* Constructed artificial general intelligence?
* Read a neat nonfiction book?

  So, as of about last week I'm commited to living on a boat. Or at least owning one.

  I purchased [a boat](https://docs.google.com/folderview?id=0B_SibNDpnu01R3ZDWDdHT2ZtM0U&usp=gmail) for $CAD 400.

  A paid $CAD 1000 to get it moved to my grandparents house, out in the middle of nowhere.

  At the end of the month, when me lease expires, I'm moving to my grandparents house for however long it takes to get the boat livable.

  It should theoretically be able to sail today, but there's a drainage hole in the bottom, so it doesn't fill with rain. Also, I don't know how to sail.

  I think that living on a boat is going to become a lot more practical in a little while, thanks to the oneweb satelight constelation. I'd like to have the skills so that I can know what I'm talking about.

  Since my previous attempt at taking over a small bit of the world (a 3D file repo, eventually providing services similar to 3Dhubs) failed, I figure it's a good opportunity to get ahead of the curve.

  Are there any big social changes you expect, thanks to the oneweb satelite constelation? What industries would it be good to invest in now, under the presumption that oneweb is going to significanty improve them?

      The big one? Probably difficult housing prices.

      I'm not seeing my being able to actually buy a house in the next ~5-ish years. If I moved somewhere with more tech employment and worked 40 hours a week I might be able to do it. Or if I had more persistence, and was willing to work a job with minimal professional development for the next 20 years...

      But realistically? No house.

      But, I can moor a boat somewhere near downtown pretty much anywhere for a reasonable price. It's something that I own in pretty much every way I can. It's not relying on my neighbors not bringing housing costs down. I don't have to pay an unpredictable amount in taxes to the government.

      I'm not putting 40% of my income towards housing...

      Since I do a lot of remote work, it seems like it will work pretty well for me. 

      Us as a society investing heavily in green technology is nice, since a lot of that technology works great at very small scale. It's made this a lot more practical then it was even a few years ago.

        I guess it's all made or unmade by the mooring prices. Keeping a boat in london isn't actually that much cheaper than renting.
        ```

        - u/traverseda:
          ```
          Most of the moorings I've seen have been around $600-$1200 a *year*.

          I imagine that a mooring in central london would be pretty steep though. They don't have a very big waterfront. They're basically built on a deep river. Basically, the worst case scenario for moorings.
          ```

          - u/Anderkent:
            ```
            Yeah, London has severe shortage of residential moorings (all the other ones only let you stay for a week or two), they can cost between 4 and 10000 GBP p.a even if you find some. And it's not like they're very central.
            ```

          - u/Teal_Thanatos:

            that is so cheap. In Australia mooring in Marina can be a couple of hundred dollars a week.

    Have you looked into any communities of people making similar decisions and living such lifestyles? I imagine they'd have a wealth of knowledge and experience to draw from and help with a dozen things you wouldn't even consider until you go through with it yourself.

    I don't know enough about the tech industry to tell what good investments would be with a coming global (free?) internet, but it would certainly open the markets to a lot of developing nations, so basic communication apps like whatsapp or kik or snapchat or viber. New localized versions of these might appear instead though, so it would still be a risky bet.

      Well, there are various people doing the "digital nomad" thing. Producing sites like remoteok and nomadlist. Those are both pretty helpful.

      I think I've got a pretty good handle on what's involved in it though. I'll be documenting my experience to help others, but I'm feeling good about my ability to handle it.

    I definitely recommend doing some crewing and sailing classes if you want to get a jump start, sailing is something that requires real skill and experience. Things can quickly get out of hand and you can't just say "im done" and be safely back in port. Its one of my most favorite things to do, but part of that is because of how serious a thing it is.

  This is an insight from the recent Origin of Species thread.

  I realized a while ago that there was a category of stories that other people tended to dislike that I really really loved. I had noticed that one feature these stories didn't have that other stories did have was the "I'm about to state the plan, and then we fade to black"

   I place a >50% confidence on that being this "law of conservation of detail." If someone has a cool plan, I want to hear it described over and over again, even in repetitive detail. I read over the abra plan about five times just because it was so neat, not because I was doing any deeper analysis.

  Part of this may be that I (believe I) have a poor mental picture of actions that expand beyond a single instance of time. I can fully picture a single "frame" of action, but when something involves multiple "frames," I can't really picture the whole thing coming together.
  ```

  - u/Sparkwitch:
    ```
    I don't think people are worried about conservation of detail, so much as they're concerned that [everything going according to plan isn't particularly suspenseful](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnspokenPlanGuarantee)(warning, TV tropes).

    As a general rule, plans which are stated will go wrong in critical ways or at crucial moments, so that the protagonists must react quickly and improve... while plans which are left unspoken work flawlessly, and reader enjoyment is in witnessing their brilliance as they happen.

    Stories of the latter type are often purposefully elaborate and confusing, with twisty resolutions and layers of deception in order to create dramatic tension... and I can imagine how that would frustrate your mental models.

  A while ago, I mentioned that I upvoted every (relevant or otherwise) comment on the threads I posted to encourage discussion, but it looks like someone decided that was gaming the system and now automatically downvotes the people who post to my threads (or threads related to me).

  So knowing that Reddit's bayesian averaging system makes this a losing proposition for me, I give up. You've won, mysterious downvoter!

  Note that I'm not complaining here, it's just interesting to see how reddit's voting system influences behavior.
  ```

  - u/blazinghand:
    ```
    I wouldn't worry about it too much! r/rational is a small sub so things stay on the front page of this sub for quite some time, even if they get downvotes. Going back 5 days on this sub, sorting by "hot," it seems like almost everything is in chronological order by day, with only a couple of popular exception (unsong, the pokemon fic, etc). I usually upvote people who respond to things I write if I think it adds content. I try to do upvotes on basically every submission in this sub that I think is on-topic, too. 

    Looking back, the only submissions I've *not* upvoted in the 50 most recent, sorted by hot, are the SENPAI Protocol, the Comeback Kid double post (though I upvoted the original), and that's it.

    So yeah, even if people commenting on your stuff get downvoted, you're still pretty visible. Going 50 items back on this sub only goes back 2 weeks; it takes quite some time to get bumped off the front page.
    ```

    - u/GaBeRockKing:
      ```
      I'm not worried about he downvotes (it's one person, at most) It would just lead to net positive utility if we'd stop cancelling each other out.
      ```

      - u/blazinghand:
        ```
        Ah, then your best strategy is to *pretend* to stop upvoting people, hoping that our hypothetical mysterious downvoter also stops participating in your duel. However, you will continue to upvote nonetheless, while loudly protesting that you do not upvote, thereby tricking him quite handily. He will think you've come to some kind of detente, when in fact you have caused him to start pushing "cooperate" while your finger remains firmly on the "defect" button in this twisted game of prisoner's dilemma!
        ```

        - u/GaBeRockKing:
          ```
          But *pretending* to stop working takes up even more energy than either not upvoting or upvoting! I'm hoping the fact that, long term, cooperate is superior to defect, to save my butt.
          ```

          - u/blazinghand:

            \*winks\* gotcha, gotcha

    >So knowing that Reddit's bayesian averaging system makes this a losing proposition for me, I give up.

    Does it? I think that if they downvoted your OP, it would make a difference, but downvoting each person in the thread at once shouldn't make any real difference.

    It might send newer posts to the bottom (because new posts that are downvoted are punished heavily, while older ones are punished less heavily), but I think that's about it.
    ```

    - u/GaBeRockKing:
      ```
      >It might send newer posts to the bottom

      And that discourages posting within a certain while of the original posting, as that gives the original posters an overall smaller chance of getting to the top of the thread because whomever does the downvoting is more likely to do it to a newer thread (no sense leaving a thread un-downvoted once they spot it.)

      Or maybe I'm just post-justifying my desire to optimize my own laziness.
      ```

      - u/electrace:
        ```
        Are people really that strategic in trying to get their internet points?

        I really hope not, but if they were, it'd probably be easier to hang out in places other than /r/rational, a reasonably tiny community.
        ```

        - u/GaBeRockKing:
          ```
          >Are people really that strategic in trying to get their internet points?

          Reddit, like all social media sites, is a type of game. In this case, we try to maximize the little point numbers on top of our comments. It's not the only way to have fun, but why not?

          Obviously we get some detrimental effects because of it (see: circlejerking) but there are plenty of other alternatives anyways.
          ```

          - u/electrace:
            ```
            Maybe for some people. But then... why hang around on /r/rational instead of /r/AskReddit or /r/funny, where it is much easier to accumulate upvotes with much less effort?
            ```

            - u/alexanderwales:
              ```
              I think it's the same reason that people [are happier when they have a higher salary than their peer group](http://www.livescience.com/8117-happiness-making-money-guy.html). It's much, much harder to accumulate karma in /r/rational than it is in /r/funny, but I don't want to hang around in /r/funny because it's a cesspool. I want my posts and comments to /r/rational to do well *by the standards of /r/rational.*

              (Based on my post karma by subreddit, the one time I ever submitted anything to /r/politics was worth twice as many internet points as submitting everything I've published in the past three years to /r/rational.)
              ```

            - u/GaBeRockKing:
              ```
              Of course, people aren't *solely* motivated by karma, but reddit has a pretty effective operant conditioning thing going on. Downvotes have been tied well enough to feelings of being disapproved that they'll affect how we act even if we're entirely aware of what's happening.
              ```

              - u/electrace:
                ```
                ಠ_ಠ

                That seems pretty unfalsifiable....
                ```

                - u/GaBeRockKing:
                  ```
                  I think it's pretty falsifiable. Imagine an experiment where you take people with, say, a liberal viewpoint, and assigning (randomly) a third of them to post exclusively to, say, /r/liberal, a third to post to /r/conservative, and a third to post to some sort of control (what a "control" would be would take some thinking.) Then we could poll them periodically on their desire to use reddit, while also averaging the posts per day of the three groups. The rub would be that we'd tell half of each group is that the point of the experiment would be to test posting response to karm.

                  Then we can compare:

                  * propensity to post more or less often based on karma
                  * enjoyment of using reddit (as defined by polling)
                  * z-tests for significance between the groups who were and were not told about the purpose of the test.

                  My theory would predict fewer posts/less enjoyment for people not recieving positive reinforcement in the form of upvotes, and that the z-tests would fail to show a significant difference.

                  I mean, I guess it's hard to falsify from a *practical* standpoint, if that was your meaning, but we could probably run a straw poll or something.
                  ```

- u/Kishoto:
  ```
  How effective is the current legal system in the US? I'm specifically thinking of how effective the 12 juror set up is. Maybe it's my cynicism but I don't really think that 12 civilians have the knowledge of intelligence needed to make an accurate judgement on a crime, even when shown all the evidence and such in a (purportedly) unbiased manner
  ```

  - u/blazinghand:
    ```
    Real next-level cynicism about the US legal system actually should address the problems not of people who get trials, but people who don't. As it stands, whether or not you like the exact setup of the jury system, it's largely irrelevant; only 5% of criminal cases go to trial [(link)](https://www.bja.gov/Publications/PleaBargainingResearchSummary.pdf). The remaining 95% end in a guilty plea / plea bargain, which is when the defendant admits guilt and waives rights to a trial by jury in return for more lenient sentencing.

    There are a variety of reasons that this happens. Some of these reasons are:

    * The state often only brings cases it's reasonably sure it can win to trial. The defendant, recognizing that a guilty verdict is inevitable, pleas out. Unlike the other reasons on this list, this one isn't really a problem. It's just the defendant making a reasonable decision based on the information available.
    * Many defendants lack the education or the knowledgeability to recognize that they have a good chance in court, and plead guilty as a result.
    * Many defendants are cowed by the possibility of spending decades in prison, and plead guilty in hopes of getting a reduced sentence that has no chance of lasting that long.
    * Many defendants lack good legal representation. Many are too poor to afford private attorneys, and pro bono work doesn't cover the gap. Public defenders are overworked. Many have less than half an hour to spend on each case.
    * The state can't afford to give trials to all the criminals it arrests *regardless*. As it is now, even accounting generously for efficiencies of scale, giving trials to 100% of defendants instead of 5% would require 10x more infrastructure, judges, bailiffs, prosecutors, public defenders, and so on.

    Effectively, the vast majority of criminals do not get a trial. Some of this is for normal reasons, like the state having caught the right criminal and having a watertight case. Some is for really bad reasons, though. Many who do not get trials would probably have better outcomes if they did have trials, but through a combination of poor circumstance, fear, and lack of education, are coerced into guilty pleas. This kind of problem applies equally to the innocent and the guilty. Happening to be innocent of a crime (or only guilty of a lesser crime) doesn't make you less impoverished, terrified, and poorly represented.
    ```

    - u/Kishoto:
      ```
      Well. That just made me sad. On some level, I knew that most cases didn't go to trial but those numbers are much higher than I'd expected. And there's no clear way to fix things without copious amounts of time, money and public interest.
      ```

  - u/LiteralHeadCannon:
    ```
    So you're saying you'd rather criminal proceedings be decided by a shadowy elite cabal?
    ```

    - u/Kishoto:
      ```
      I'm expressing doubt in the ability of 12 average Joes to judge a case presented by several experts (lawyers, judges, forensic analysts, etc.)

      It's very easy to mislead the average person. 

      I am saying nothing for or against shadowy cabals
