  I interact with you guys fairly regularly, and consider us a community. Was just curious on the age demographic here. There's no real purpose to this, just satisfying my curiosity. I encourage as many people as possible to fill it out! I'll publish the results publicly, if people want, and of course it's **COMPLETELY ANONYMOUS**.

    I guess your answer to that one depends on whether you're a glass half full or glass half empty kind of guy
    ```

      What if you are more of a "look, my glass has uranium in it" kind of guy?
      ```

- u/None:
  ```
  In a week I'll join you in your 21ness :)

    <sarcasm> Ageists. </sarcasm >
    ```

- u/None:

  Results when?
