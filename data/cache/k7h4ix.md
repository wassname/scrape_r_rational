## Only You Can Save Mankind [RT] Stargate Atlantis/Enders Game/Terry Pratchett Xover

### Post:

I don't think this has been recommended here before, it's one of my favorite fics by one of my favorite authors.  She also has an account with more current stuff up on AO3 too.

  It's sad that this breaks my suspension of disbelief nowadays.

    > The leaders of Earth looked at each other and knew, deep in their soul, that a number of conspirators among the other leaders were somehow faking this to screw over them and their donors,

    I fixed it.

      The leaders of Earth looked at each other and knew that they would be perfectly fine coorpoerating as long as the brunt of the world were placed on their enemies. They formed the anti-wraith agreement. 5 years after the US withdrew from the agreement.

  Only You Can Save Mankind was the first Terry Pratchett book I ever read. My god, I haven't seen it mentioned in 20 years. The nostalgia, man. I haven't read Ender's Game, but I might have to give it a go just so I can check this out.

    Enders game is totally cool but also something to bring your critical gaze to, but I would strongly recommend this authors other Terry Pratchett fanfics. She's got a couple of straight good omen and discworld fics that really capture Terry Pratchetts voice, and a really good harry potter DEATH crossover.

    The other stuff doesn't really have a rational bent, but I am a big fan.

    And yeah I grew up in London but have never met anyone else who read his early stuff. johnny maxwell/gnomes/strata/dark side of the sun, I really loved those books.

  That was a delightful little read. It didn't actually seem much like a crossover; it would be really, really easy to divest from the "source material" entirely and just publish as a YA novel.

  I was initially worried. The viewpoint character seemed awful. Then, it revealed that it was *Rodney* and everything fell into place. I was slightly disappointed that he didn't get too much screentime with Sam, as one of Rodney's funniest traits is that Sam is better than him at everything. But still, this was good stuff.

  In defense of Woosley, he is a bureaucrat, and a damn good one. The i's will be dotted, the t's will be crossed, rules will be followed. Whatever you put him in charge of will be made predictable. Some idiot decided to have him investigate the Stargate program, which is just the entirely wrong organization for it.  Everyone from the general to the janitor is flying by the seat of their pants. The countdown on the onsite nuke starts every other month, because an invisible and intangible critter made it through the gate and is mind-controlling all the doors to eat people. Then gets called of because someone from engineering stapled a battery from a lost civilization that no one understands to a can open from a *different* lost civilization that no one understands, and that can match dimensional frequencies so that the P-90s can actually shoot it.

  It's very well written for the most part. Read only the first 2 chapters so far.
  Some of the things Sheppard says & thinks is not something a 7 year old would do, which breaks immersion.
