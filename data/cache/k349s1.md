  The slow descent into madness by Delve readers has been hilarious. At this point I think you poor souls are going to go insane if Rain doesn't increase his cap by 10-15 chapters.
  ```

    ```
    We might yet be saved if we get to see someone quantitatively optimizing one of the new awakeneds' builds.
    ```

  - u/TheColourOfHeartache:
    ```
    Not me. I'm enjoying reading Rain doing sensible things with party design and having a good slice of life, I don't need his personal numbers to go up to keep me happy.
    ```

    - u/LazarusRises:

      Same. I'm very happy to read a story about party optimization, especially because it seems like that's legitimately a new approach for this era (or at least a very uncommon one). I don't even know why I bother reading this sub's comments anymore since I know I'll just get annoyed at all the whining.
      ```

      - u/TheColourOfHeartache:

        It is weird how uncommon it is to see party optimisation, which is weird since it's such a fundamental part of MMOs. (Though admittedly no MMO will make, say, an ice build unviable for fire dungeons or anything like that).

        And I think Delve's success shows there's a big gap in the market for it too.
        ```

        - u/kaukamieli:
          ```
          Maybe it is easier to write an uberman stomping everything than good dialogue that would be absolutely necessary on this?

          But Delve's success shows nothing of the kind. Isn't this recent development? Did you expect a lot of party optimization going in? Maybe when he got a support build, but this far we have had basically none of that until nosw. It has been people that have been available, and they haven't really told anyone their build.
          ```

          - u/TheColourOfHeartache:
            ```
            I'd say you could see it as far back as the first time Rain went into a dungeon. You had a tank, two DPS mages, a dedicated support. That already puts it above most litRPG in terms of teamwork.

            I remember at the time, when rain was knocked off a bridge, everyone was talking about the inevitable cliche of the MC getting separated and coming back stronger. But nope, it's handled sensibly with Ameliah instantly jumping down to get him.
            ```

            - u/kaukamieli:
              ```
              It is teamwork, but did you see any optimization happening? Did they have many choices to choose different classes? Or did they already have a group again and then asked Rain to come too? I checked and it is the second one. They did what they did, haooened to find Rain, and took him with them. They were gonna go anyway. That is not optimization.

              Managing a party is not getting into a party as a noob and get carried through the dungeon.

              The build he chose did show possibilities, but that is it.
              ```

              - u/TheColourOfHeartache:
                ```
                You're mistaken. Go back to chapter 28 when Rain, Jamus and Val first start making their plans to raid the lair. Jamus and Rain are both insisting they need a proper tank in the face of Val's typical overconfidence. So they did in fact plan out a party composition despite Rain being over three times the lair's level. 

                And then of course there's the fact they're bringing a light mage to counter a dark lair. The way the mages adapt their strategy to mana abundance. It's not the level of optimisation Rain is doing with Ascension, but even back there it was clear that bringing a balanced party matters.
                ```

                - u/kaukamieli:
                  ```
                  Oh, they really dragged their feet about going there. I also misremembered that that we were talking about their first dungeon, but this is Rain's third o(or fourth?) already. I thought they were already at the dungeon at that point. Ok, I'll give that they did notice they need a tank after trying to make Rain go first.

                  That Rain did not want to go in first to die, is not what I'd call "party management". In fact it looks very mismanaged, without any leadership or competence. And they mentioned "preparation" after that, which is funny.

                  Val, on the other hand, just was there when they mentioned about going to a dungeon, and said his magic would be perfect. That's not optimization.

                  If you get your party optimization kicks about writer explaining what a "tank" is and noticing that mages are kinda squishy, great. These are supposed to be like professional adventurers? Ofc author needs to tell readers what the terms mean.

                  I don't mean to bash this story, I like it a lot. But definitely not for the party optimization. :D

    I think it's mostly the fact that the author is trying to write a more real, fleshed out, slow burner of a story compared to other litrpg's but like... He's just not a good enough writer. The world-building is generic, the entire cast of characters are completely flat and literally everyone speaks in the same voice (you could basically switch around the names of characters in most dialogue at random and no one would notice.), and the main character has one of the most bland and generic personalities I've ever read. Actually I wouldn't even call Rain generic, because that word implies he has traits common to other protagonists. Rain basically has no consistent character traits, he just walks around and acts seemingly at random depending on what the story needs, usually in an eye-rolling, cringey way. 

    People enjoyed Delve for the cool systems and munchkinry and powers. It was always a slow-burn, but we got to see Rain consistently progress while also getting glimpses of higher power characters in action. But for like...60 chapters now, there's been 0 progression or fresh systems or anything. Just a slow, boring, poorly written story with no signs of improvement.

    I decided to drop this series for good when I read a ~20ish chapter batch at once, and at the end of it I looked back and couldn't remember a single moment of enjoyment from reading basically 1/5th of the total story.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      The fact that He Who Fights With Monsters is now worse than Delve and that has nothing to do with Delve getting better lately is so depressing. All the fun of Delve was thrown away for no fucking reason and the author never really explained why.
      ```

    - u/LazarusRises:
      ```
      I disagree with... almost everything in your comment. I think SS is a fine, if unexceptional, writer who is exploring different areas with his story, which is ok and even expected in a serial novel. There's a large cast of side characters who we haven't seen enough of to differentiate, but Rain is nerdy and experimental, Ameliah is calm and competent, Tallheart is grim and terse, Val is impulsive and ambitious, Staavo is inventive and crotchety, Carten is loud and jolly, that swordsman from the last chapter is quiet and dedicated, Velika was rash and bullheaded... that's a solid cast of easily-distinguished characters right there. And then we have the fun and clearly individual side characters of Myth & Reason with their rhyming riddler schtick, Mollo who curses a lot, Dozer who is just adorable, whatever-her-name-is the terrifying Force-magic goldplate, the other whatever-her-name-is the terrifying Mind-magic gold- or platinum-plate...

      It seems like you share the opinion of a lot of folks in this sub, which is "Delve stopped being interesting when Rain's numbers stopped going up." Yeah, it's not a story about the protag leveling up anymore, that's become very clear. It's a story about the development of an adventuring company now. Your second-to-last paragraph says "there's been 0... fresh sytems," when we just this chapter got a glimpse of like, 12 new classes, plus the entirely novel mechanic of crafting classes' medium/augment/discipline combinations. 

      It also seems from your last paragraph that you haven't been reading Delve lately. So can I infer that you just dropped in to shit on the story and air your grievances? I guess that's technically a *valid* use of the comments section, but it's sure not a *productive* one.

      EDIT: The downvote button is not a "disagree" button, folks. State your issues if you have them.

        Not to mention soulstuff, meditation, hacking ancient artifacts, mind control, different kind of dungeon... This guy has not read the fic at all if he did not notice any new systems lately.

- u/Obscene_Elbows:
  ```
  I don't know why, but this novel feels now very different from the beginning. Maybe because at the start it was about learning a new language, figuring out the leveling system and the cultural clash of our world and the delve world.

  And I completly loath this democracy company leader shtick that Rain has going."Hur dur, Democracy good, Monarchy bad" while no real democracy is involved in the company and it just works because he has some of the strongest people in the region as friends.

  Wacky, funny company leader Rain says funny thing got old really fast.
  ```

  - u/_Ternal_:
    ```
    Rain's not actually setting up a democracy here. He's setting up a pirate ship: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governance_in_18th-century_piracy
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      The appearance of "Democracy" is service of boosting opinion is an old invention that nonetheless works fairly well. I don't think Rain knows he's using it, but that's what he's doing.
      ```

  - u/TheTruthVeritas:
    ```
    And honestly, Democracy isn’t really the optimal choice if you’re an isekai’d person from a modern world. People don’t tend to flow with big changes, as our long history can surely attest to. 


    Especially this, what Rain has is essentially a mockery of democracy anyways, and he brute forces everything he suggests. Might as well just admit that he’s the brain and will call the shots right now, as there’s nobody else in the group competent and ambitious enough as an alternative. He can change the leadership to a democracy and guide them through that later anyways, having one or two terms to guide the company through the process at the start.

    Nobody there even cared about democracy anyways as that world is used to monarchy, so why did Rain even bother with the farce? Now that I think about it, this whole setup feels super contrived and unnecessary.
    ```

    - u/Amonwilde:
      ```
      One of the issues with the democracy setup is that every other character -(~2) is depicted as an idiot.
      ```

    - u/Slyvena:
      ```
      He is very much "I HALPING" right now. Give him another 5 years and I'm sure he'll figure legit democracy out

      edit: I'm not actually joking. It will probably take about 5 years of updates for him to get there.
      ```

      - u/kaukamieli:
        ```
        He does not want to feel like a dictator.
        ```

        - u/Slyvena:
          ```
          And props to him for that. But he is naive to think his system is being accepted and implemented for any reason other than that he is the strongest dude around with the strongest friends.  
          People are 'choosing' democracy right now. Except if Rain came up with another system they'd all suddenly agree that one was better too.
          ```

          - u/kaukamieli:
            ```
            Yes, they are just following what he is doing. But it does not remove the fact that he _does_ limit his power within the company. I expect conflict with this stuff later. He _does_ give them stuff they can use to remove him or do something else than what he wants.

            It is also not just being strongest. They know Rain and friends helped saving the city. Also, Rain is providing them superpowers, and is now successful in that. His team can feasibly provide them with superpowers. Did I mention possibility of getting superpowers?
            ```

            - u/Slyvena:
              ```
              Hey I'm with you on him being a good dude and trying to put in place democracy.  
              I'm just also a realist that acknowledges that for at least the next 6 months minimum, it will only function because of his explicit word which he could withdraw at any moment.

              When some of the strong folk want to get a blue instead of the regulars, its not democracy that will stop them, its Ameliah'n'Friends saying 'down boy'.  
              And if Rain decides its more important for him to a Lvl26 blue for some plot reason, you better believe his pet 'Democracy in name' won't stop him then.

        - u/slvrcrystalc:
          ```
          I agree- the whole democracy thing is actually from his selfish motivation to feel better about being the leader.  But he set it up badly- Democracy without checks is just Populism.  I agree with user Ternal's pirateship comment, and it's not going to be good for a long term Guild, but he'll work on it.

          I'm expecting to see pushback from his brand new ideas that go against 'common knowledge' and him getting voted out for some traditionalist charismatic newcomer on the first roadblock type thing he hits.  Maybe he makes a big mistake and even wants to not be in charge- but that will change when he sees that the super sure 'leaders' are way worse than his worst.
          ```

    - u/danielv134:
      ```
      Because in the last few months he has been the ignored, abused outcast and has encountered 3 different leaders that abused everyone under them just because they can, and when taking the leader mantle he is trying hard to signal to others and especially to himself he's not going for the same thing, even if the situation is pushing him hard towards autocracy?

      If you think educating for democracy in theory while actually falling into telling everyone what to do is hypocrisy, I'm not sure you appreciate that letting people under your leadership find their way (while still coordinating with the larger group) is _much harder_ and a totally separate set of skills than either education or basic "go there now" leadership.

    - u/Izeinwinter:
      ```
      Think of ascension as a pirate or mercenary band. It is a pretty close historical parallel - they are a group of professional practitioners of violence only vaguely answerable to anything like a state authority. Lots of these orgs were, historically, quite heavily democratic internally, because conflicts about authority needed a non-violent resolution mechanism very, very badly if the band were to persist. Also, of course, iron discipline while in actual battle.

      - u/None:

        Sure that is true but the author doesn't make any effort to indicate that that is what they were doing.

        - u/EsquilaxM:

  I'm surprised they didn't go for a Lockdown Debuffer (ie Weaken, Slow, Blind, Stun, Sleep, etc). This isn't going to be the last blue they corral, and that's the sort of role you want specifically for blue corralling which is also useful for normal fighting.

  Can I get a blue-watch going on the posts? Like can someone who subs to the advance chapters give me a 1-10 on the “blueness” of the most recent patreon chapter? 

  I **really** can’t wait for the chapter that is 8 before he gets a lie to just have a random 300 comments. And just every week after that it’s the same. 

  Also I just checked the patreon and the author is pulling $4k per month on this lmao. The definition of a cash cow with the pace this novel is at. Dude is living his best life 😂😂😂

      I mean the first step is to write a story people are willing to pay for, which is obviously the hardest part, but I think the author has the perfect money making format. The *only* thing I can think of is that if I did it I would have to release twice a week. I couldn’t handle everyone complaining about my story lmao, I’m too sensitive
      ```

      - u/plutonicHumanoid:
        ```
        It’s really not a good money making formula, I don’t know how it works. You get a one-time advantage so you’d expect people to just pay once and then stop. They fall back from where they got by paying, and I guess since the people paying are the most devoted it makes some sense that they don’t want to stop being ahead for any time. I don’t know, the model annoys me either way.

        - u/Nick_named_Nick:

          I think most people who are supporting creators on patreon just don’t care about $2.5 per month, so they stay subscribed so they don’t lose 2 months of their life waiting. Unless they drop the story completely, I bet the story has pretty high retention rates month to month

    On the Patreon *there could* be a blue in 3-4 chapters. (last Chapter was 131) If it doesn't happen in December, I think a *very high* likelihood it happens in January for Patreon.  I think the prices are reasonable.  I typically give $20 to support a novel for the year for whatever it gets me...for Delve that is 8 months, lol.

  Ok, I'm cancelling my patreon for this fic. Why? I realized I hate Rain. I detest this wacky, zany little fucker, still throwing out nonsensical idioms, expressions, analogies, metaphors and proverbs **months** after traveling to another dimension and while *speaking another fucking language*. 

  (As an aside, I'm convinced the author is one of those monolingual cretins who can't even fathom what it's like to speak another language. Never even paused to think about it, assumes it's like using Google translate in your brain.)

  I've never seen an asshole use so many expressions in common speech before! Imagine Rain going through the trouble to pick out words in another language to form sentences that are tantamount to gibberish to every other person around him. AND WHEN THERE'S NO TRANSLATION HE USES AN ENGLISH WORD, I GUESS??

  And for what? So that every other POV character will roll his eyes indulgently and ignore what is in effect an imposition of his rank on his subordinates, because they can't actually call him out?  Rains like, "fuck prima noche, I won't fuck your wife on your wedding day, instead I'll exploit our disparity in rank to fuck with your understanding of language as a vehicle for mutually coherent communication." 

  tl;dr: fuck Rain, fuck the author, and fuck me for not just putting up with this shitty character writing, but ***paying for it.***
  ```

  - u/Menolith:
    ```
    I have to agree on the bilingual side, though with slightly less... verbosity.

    I wouldn't imagine telling an English person that "Man, he just seemed black-socked about it" because I understand that translating idioms over word-for-word is just not how it works.
    ```

    - u/Slyvena:
      ```
      That's right, better to bite the bullet instead of cutting corners, otherwise it'll just burn bridges as the idiom flys over their heads.

      Overmana mostly improves memory, so Rain has a native level vocabulary, but I don't think the text has claimed he would be a native level speaker. Besides, my dad moved across the country 30 years ago and his old dialect still pops up often. It's silly to be angry at Rain for not abandoning a lifetime of idioms in a few months. I don't even think he should. Dialects are fun. Making people hear idioms for the first time is not a horrible act of cruelty.
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        I think part of the problem is that it has been a few months for rain but nearly 2 *years* for the readers. Because not only does the author write mediocre prose and less than mediocre characterization but he takes years to do it. Like almost makes me want to read exclusively translated light novel inspired smut because at least those guys put out *content* while writing mediocrely.
        ```

        - u/assbutter9:
          ```
          Yup, I think you made me realize what my actual main problem with this story is.

          I've read stuff with worse prose, equally bad characters, more boring worlds, etc etc. But those stories at last feel honest about what they are. I like turning my brain off sometimes and binge-reading fast paced, fun, lower quality stuff. But not even that is possible with Delve because, 1. It isn't a fun story, and 2. The author only puts out a few thousand words per week, and half of those words are the same repetitive number crunching we've seen from the start.

          The author of the Wandering Inn for example puts out 40k-50k+ words per week consistently, at much higher quality while always being a fun read. Delve puts out what...like 10% of that? So the story is not only poorly written and extremely slow, the content releases are so tiny that I can't even read it as a guilty pleasure.
          ```

          - u/None:
            ```
            I would be fine with the number crunching if we actually got a lot of information about the system. Like I could look at a bunch of classes and think about what I would do with that system. Half of all time spent on real RPGs is in character creation after all. But we actually *don't* get a lot of information.

            And yeah the key issue with Delve is the time it takes to put out what is essentially a tiny amount of overall content. I think of it from a Patreon angle personally. Like perhaps the story has an end date and the author doesn't have anything else in the pipe for Patreon so they have to string out the existing story over as long a time as possible to keep that sweet, sweet 4k$ a month coming in.

            There's nothing in the story that is so difficult to write well, especially since the author is not a great writer, that justifies the pace of the release.
            ```

          - u/Reply_or_Not:
            ```
            Wandering Inn is exceptional and probably a poor comparison.  I think something like Azarinth Healer is a better comparison.

            AH has pretty basic writing, at best.  Has pretty flat and generic characters, is certainly worse edited and only has a little more words written per week. 

            And yet I’ve no problem being a patreon for AH because the story actually *goes places*

            - u/assbutter9:
              ```
              Ohhh yeah I agree that's actually a perfect example. I think Azarinth Healer is far from "good", but I'm a patreon sub too because it at least scratches my guilty pleasure itch.

        Also the whole "the entire world I knew is gone and I have no knowledge of a way to go back" would definitely be an influence on trying to keep something from there with him in spirit. Like if you move overseas nowadays (and plan it, rather than are instantly teleported), that'd be easier to process and there's lines of communication home, not so much for Rain.

  - u/Grasmel:
    ```
    To some extent people try to translate idioms word for word (i used to do this myself), but that's mostly a thing with very new speakers who just don't know any of the new expressions and are translating word for word mentally anyway. Rain is supposed to be at the level of native speaker, much beyond that. 

    I don't even understand why the author bothered to have a separate language in the first place. Just have everyone in the new universe speak English, it's not any weirder than it being full of humans.
    ```

    - u/plutonicHumanoid:
      ```
      Actually I think having Rain learn the language was a really neat part of the early portion of the story. It added some extra struggle and his quick learning was a good demonstration of the effects of Clarity. Also it’s just not something you see in isekai, it was a nice variation.


      From an in-universe perspective, since he kinda cheated at learning the language it makes some sense he keeps adding English to it. But out-of-universe it really is annoying at this point.
      ```

      - u/UlyssesB:
        ```
        And you'd expect at some point surely he'd stop. He should be exposed to this world's idioms all the time and start picking up on them eventually. Surely he's not going to stay like this for the rest of his life?
        ```

- u/Agasthenes:

  Honestly, every delve thread is complaining and blue jerking. Either drop the fic or go with the shifted focus. You don't need numbers to go up to be engaged with a story.

  - u/xachariah:

    I suspect Delve posts here are hostile because this sub is offsite and patreon exists.  Everyone who really likes/cares about Delve is already months ahead and discussing it on Patreon or discord.  Everyone who doesn't care comments on RR.

    This skews the people here more towards those who both care and don't like it, which results in a hostile atmosphere.

      Hmm i wouldn't go as far as saying if you don't spend money on patreon you don't love this story.

    You might be surprised at the number of people who already have dropped the story and are just wanting to see if it is worth picking up again.  That’s where I’m at right now

    Bold of you to assume what people like.  Bolder to think the internet isnt about bitching about things as well as porn.
