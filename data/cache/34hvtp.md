  Hey all! Super rough draft out for super late chapter! Life's been crazy lately. Good, but crazy. I'll do a major edit wave tomorrow. Enjoy, and all feedback welcome, as usual! 

  Also, apparently FF doesn't allow less than or greater than symbols in text, so just pretend there's a less than symbol in front of the "333" when you see them. You'll get it.

  Sweet chapter. Showed the aftermath of the fire, how everyone was coping and a bit of worldbuilding about how pokemon are healed. I particularly liked the suspicious nurse asking after the limb-less Shiftry, as that /would/ be a very suspicious event. And still kinda is, even with the explanation from Blue.

  Edit:"He's still working ten minutes later when a doctor behind her." Not quite sure what you meant by this.

    Fixed, thanks! Was meant to read "enters and closes the door behind." Just scratched that part.

  This is still being updated? Woo! I found this story a while ago and could not stop thinking of it since, I'm so glad it's still being actively written and wasn't abandoned. Keep up the great work, can't wait to see where the story'll go next. :)

  How are you planning on dealing with weather moves?

  Rain Dance as cloud-seeding? Hail and Sandstorm as chucking a load ice or sand into the air? Sunny Day as I-have-no-idea?
  ```

    I'm changing a number of moves to create a sliding scale of power that's more realistic. 

    So if say a dewgong uses "blizzard," its range and affect is very localized: some cold wind and shards of ice flung around in a limited area.  Compared to, say, Articuno's blizzard, which can affect a whole city.

    Same goes for the more traditional "weather abilities" like Sunny Day.  Those used by "regular" pokemon are pale imitations of the originals, which are pretty much restricted to the few extremely rare pokemon that have weather effects tied to their abilities: Kyogre and Groudon and Rayquaza being the main three, and then say one in a million Ninetails or Politoad or Tyranitar or Abomisnow (even though those latter two have it as regular abilities rather than "hidden" ones).

    Does that makes sense?

  Wow! I discovered this and read it a couple weeks ago and thought it might have been abandoned. Great fic. I can't wait to read more.
