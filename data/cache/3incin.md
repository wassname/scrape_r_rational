## [BST][HF]I struggle with motivation for magical entities.

### Post:

I don't write anything, but I like to ponder about magic systems in my free time. My favorite one consists of following:

1) All magic is actually telekinesis, sometimes performed on nanolevels with magic particles. This telekinesis follows Newton's Third Law (otherwise flight is too cheap, and that's less interesting)

1.1) There's actually a version that includes divination, allowing to get information from much father range from telekinesis.

2) Simple spells like temperature manipulation, large-scale telekinesis and maybe electrokinesis are relatively simple and just require some magic power.

3) It's possible to do more difficult stuff, like forcing chemical transformatiions, affecting living organisms and minds. But most of them require modern or at least Renaissance knowledge (and I kinda want medieval-style setting). While magic-based research can bring forth a lot of knowledge, I think industrial revolution would come far sooner than enough knowledge to do efficient bio/psycho magic.

3.1) And also even if there's a knowledge, there's an issue of control. Even if mages can "write" something like a programs (since you can't consciously control millions of nanobots), the amount of "debugging" is immence. Afaik, Ra explored some of these troubles.

4) Thus I tend to include entities that provide some mages with knowledge and control to do bio/psycho magic (and even simpler stuff, like efficient flying). I kinda want these entities to be ephemeral, sentient and very clever, but can't construct their motivations. Why do they agree to help humans without taking over with all their intelligence and magical prowess?

  Option 1: The entities are actually avatars of trans-universal scientists (or the operators of the Universe simulation, if you want to go that way) who want to work in limited ways to test aspects of this hypothetical universe.

  Option 2: The entities are wildly, massively different from humans mentally, such that neither can comprehend the other, and the only similarity is their ravenous curiosity about other forms of life. They want to know how humans could learn to use magic rather than just controlling them and using it in the ways they already know.

  Option 3: The entities absolutely do take control, but they find it enjoyable to be perfect mimics of their captives.

  You could pull an Atlantis and have them be a constructed species created by a since-fallen civilization. Maybe they're just a straight up archival system meant to store records through any catastrophe (although that wouldn't really be the best way to do it). Maybe they were a servant race that were keyed to certain artifacts/individuals, without which they're largely unresponsive (perhaps willing to answer a few questions but not engage for too long or leave whatever locations they inhabit).

  Basically with a past human civilization you can come up with a lot of reasons for them to not take over the world but still help humans. But of course you end up with more issues/exploits you need to deal with (why did Atlantis fall? what happens if someone finds the house-elf control ring?).

  The entities could just be bored. If you were omnipotent and omniscient, there's no reason for you to *not* give mages knowledge.

  They don't necessarily need an agenda that requires acquiring power or control over people. You might want to look up the cobblers and brownies of old British folklore. Spirits that would do household chores in the night but if you tried to see them, thank them or give them gifts then they became insulted and would punish you or leave forever.

  1) Couldn't you still fly by pushing on the ground? It's more limited, since you can't go past your range, but it works. You could also fly by pushing the air around if you do want to go high. Although maybe you're okay with this. It seems difficult enough to be interesting.

  Off the top of my head:

  a) maybe they use humans as phones?
  Entities are sort of locked in place (gives you an excuse for different areas to have primarily one type of magic), so they use people for communication.
  They give a mage a spell, and/or a quest, and use leftover room to carry info to other Entities.


  B) Maybe they use people for reproduction, like flowers and bees. The more mages there are, the better their population.



  C) Another way you could do this is make the Entities distributed infomorphs. to have them use mages like a torrenting service, where the entities are torrents. Every mage they teach a spell to carries a seed of their existence. As long as one is around, they're immortal. 
  I imagine that when warring against one another, they have their mages target the competition.

  ```
  Orange and Blue motivations (or morality) is the way to go here. The "good vs. selfish" axis is for humans.

  Just because a human would take power or something doesn't mean the spirit wants to do that. Give your non-human entities totally alien (but somewhat predictable once you get to know them) preferences.
