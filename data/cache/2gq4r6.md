  *Radiance* was, I thought, a lot better than *Luminosity*. You could see the author getting better as she went, I thought. One of the cool things that the original series of Twilight books did was having different character possess extra powers that were unique to them, and *Luminosity* carried it much further than the original series did, and took it in some unique directions.
  ```

  - u/TimeLoopedPowerGamer:
    ```
    *Radiance* is a lot better written, I'll give it that. Better *overall* plotting, too.

    Agree about canon being picked up and run with well in *Luminosity*.

    Not sure about how strong the characterizations were in *Radiance* itself, though...
    ```

  - u/Cruithne:
    ```
    I disagree about Radiance being better than Luminosity. I think Radiance took too long to wrap the story up after the reader already had an idea of where it would go, and it was quite a detrimental effect.
    ```

- u/PeridexisErrant:
  ```
  Probably more influential in defining rationalist fiction than even *Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality*, and notable as fanfiction widely acclaimed as better than the original - if you haven't read them yet, you should!

  >My favorite three questions are, *What do I want?, What do I have?*, and *How can I best use the latter to get the former?*

  >Actually, I'm also fond of *What kind of person am I?*, but that one isn't often directly relevant to decision making on a day-to-day basis.

  *Luminosity* takes us through *Twilight* with Bella as an introspective rationalist instead of a doormat, and beautifully showcases both the inner and outer changes that result.  By the end, the canon saga is thoroughly off the rails, and *Radiance* has to be read to be believed...
  ```

  - u/TimeLoopedPowerGamer:
    ```
    >and Radiance has to be read to be believed

    I don't know...I think *Radiance* had some serious, serious problems, even after the rough start. I completely stalled out in it, something that didn't happen even in the probably-too-long *Luminosity*.

    I think you can only jerk the reader and the characters around so much without losing them. *[Pact](http://pactwebserial.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/)* has a similar issue of trying to be dangerous and edgy, but it just ends up just being a rollercoaster full of violent jerks without any payoff. I've stopped reading it entirely at this point.

    All three stories seem to have been made with a certain type of (I hate to say it) juvenile character abuse porn in mind, and it doesn't seem to ever allow anyone to accomplish anything. *Luminosity* didn't start that way, which if you know its history is telling.

    The start of *Luminosity* is some of the best rationalist fanfic ever written. The rest is very average.

    Along with *Worm*, these are at the vanguard of a wave of rational and rationalist fiction that seems to demand constant maximum worst results in the pursuit of "realism", with not even a [earn your happy ending](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourHappyEnding) in sight.

    If the protagonist makes a sandwich in chapter 6, someone will try to murder them because of it by the end of chapter 10. If people aren't naked, alone, and bleeding, just wait until the next arc.

    Cheap drama from constant danger isn't good writing. But these are also very popular stories.

    So, I'd like to hope that some day they *don't* define the genre of rationalist fiction, but I can't really argue that they haven't so far.

    Wow. That didn't start out so negative and grumpy. Oh well. [Anyone want some pizza rolls? I can email them to you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxKtZmQgxrI)...

      ```
      I get it with Pact, but not the others. In Worm it reads to me as problems proportionate to the power of the main character, *Luminosity* and *Radiance* has a pacing issue with the majority of conflict concentrated in the second book but it's more about concentration than overall levels of awfulness. I prefer the intensity of *Radiance* to the sort of easygoing feel of *Luminosity*. *Luminosity* has more of that typical fanfic feel of nothing really going wrong.
      ```

      - u/TimeLoopedPowerGamer:
        ```
        Then you are the target audience and they nailed it.

        >Luminosity has more of that typical fanfic feel of nothing really going wrong.

        ಠ_ಠ

        We did read the same full story, right?
        ```

        - u/somnicule:
          ```
          [Well,](#s "except at the end, of course.") And it has been a while since I read it.
          ```

          - u/TimeLoopedPowerGamer:
            ```
            I think you just remembered the moderately good parts...so yay?
            ```

    - u/alexanderwales:
      ```
      I mostly agree with this. I stopped reading Pact because it was too grim and gritty without many spots of hope - it felt suffocating (and it's weird, because Wildbow has said that he realized Worm needed more hope and more breathers, but I felt like if anything, he made Pact worse). I very nearly stopped reading Worm for the same reason, but I tend to stick things out once I've started, and the use of powers was at least novel enough that I stuck with it.
      ```

      - u/AmeteurOpinions:
        ```
        I'll third this, but I'm not going to stop reading. Great as he is, Evan isn't enough to lift the mood high enough for the lows to hit as hard as they could, and the bit with Green Eyes was over too soon. I hope she comes back, and doesn't get eaten sharks or something.
        ```

    - u/loonyphoenix:
      ```
      Huh. You put it a lot better than I did in my review of Luminosity. I'll put it here (warning: spoilers) for comparison.

      > I think this is the best Twilight fic there is. Thank you very much for your wrighting! HPMOR still beats it, but that's a different universe, and I think Twilight is a much more difficult one to rationalize. For example, your reimagining inherited some of the inherent contradictions, such as Aro saying he doesn't know why Edward doesn't simply eat Bella, even though it's common knowledge among vampires that mates come first, always. There may be several singers providing momentary pleasure, but there is only one mate. That's an incredibly silly thing to say for a millenia-year-old vampire with thousands of millenia of memories stored in his head.

      > One complaint I do have is that a little too many of the major plot points are based on highly improbable events, even in this highly improbable universe. I'm not speaking of the one event that made all Bella's plans go askew at the end of Luminosity, although it does irk me; that's plausible, and only a little improbable, but once is okay. But when this happens over and over again... A friendly pack of werewolves being in the neighbourhood just in time for Elspeth to stumble into after she runs from another, not so friendly pack of werewolves? Cody defecting right after he finds out about Bella being alive, not a week earlier, not a week later? The highly improbable coincidence that Petra is Bella's singer? And this is just the beginning of the second book.

      > All these coincidences mean that the plot develops in an entirely unpredictable, illogical way, subject only to the author's fancy. You can't predict the people in the universe; when you're reading the novel, you are forced to try to predict the author, instead, and that just detracts from the enjoyment. Where such coincidences were acceptable for the not entirely serious, adolescently romantic canon, this fic presumes to be serious and rational, and expecting readers to suspend their disbelief just isn't very compatible with this style of writing.

      > I think the reason you had to use coincidences is because you made too few changes in the universe. You made Bella smarter and more rational, but everything else, as I see it, is the same. There was no other way to make life more difficult for the heroes without some major bad luck. I think it would have been better if you altered the universe to be a harder challenge for Bella's wit; made the Volturi smarter, changed some of the laws, introduced new elements - whatever.

      > But, again, Twilight is a very difficult universe to make sensible, and a lot of effort was obviously made towards that end. I enjoyed the fic very much, I agree with Bella's thinking in the first book a lot, and I find the end result very satisfactory.

      > Thanks again for writing.

      One of Worm's warnings is that it is not a story that you should read if you are the type of person who requires trigger warnings. I am the type of person who requires trigger warnings. If trauma becomes a major defining point of rationalist fanfiction, I will be very sad because I cannot read stories which engage in more than a certain density of character trauma. (Oddly, I am fine with depictions of the *aftermath* of that trauma.)

      Yep.  I can see your point though; after they leave Norway the story spends a long time in "it got worse" territory.  Still a well-written story in a  rational setting, but not as beautifully rationalist.

      I can't speak about Luminosity and Radiance, I got bored half into Radiance and stopped. But your gut felling of Worm is not unusual or even rare in this sub. 

      There was a previous thread some time ago where someone else made a comment on how Worm is rational, and maybe even rationalist, I got upset (and I still do every time this happens), there was backlash and I made it as response and critique of Worm characters and world.

      Beware however that I was upset at the time and wrote this with a snide, condescending  and mean attitude. It gets better as it goes on (I could be wrong) so don't be put out by my childish remarks.

      And this

        I'm fairly certain it was [my recommendation](http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/1m7gta/good_stories/cc6i2ik) that made EY and everyone else go read it. I said it was clever and emotional, but never rational, and certainly not rationalist. EY never said it was rationalist.

        *Worm* is not rationalist. It was never meant to be. It's a deconstruction of superhero tropes first and a smart web serial second, written at the speed of light. A fully rational *Worm* looks like [*Weaver Nine*](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2crqh0/weaver_nine_worm_fanfic_au/), but that rearranges the character roster and was a patched version anyway. I'm looking forward to the print edition.

        Honestly I think you went in with some skewed/hyped expectations (can't blame you, looking back at that rec thread -- ugh), but I'm still going to hold to *Worm* as a very special piece of fiction for the scale and speed of its run, considering the fact that the author probably hadn't have heard of true rationality when he'd started writing.

        You said it yourself:

        > It’s okay to read about irrational things and stories written in emotion and silly stories. Because let’s face it, writing hpmor took a lot of effort on EY, and it would take an even greater effort to write like that about a whole world which is being attacked by nigh invincible monsters that wage war on all of mankind.

          > Honestly I think you went in with some skewed/hyped expectations

          This is so true. The whole story showed up in the periods of low hpmor chapters. I spent a lot of time in the beginning thinking up various uses for powers and expecting the protag to fix everything forever, that I overlooked the tone of the work until it was too late.
          ```

          - u/AmeteurOpinions:
            ```
            Heh. In contrast, I knew *nothing* about the story except that it was free and it was about an introverted superhero.

      Earn Your Happy Ending

      ____
      The basic idea of this trope is that a cast of characters in a story go
      through a lot more hardship, anguish and grief than is really necessary. In
      the end, however, you see them get their happily-ever-after. While humans may
      act [ bad ](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreBastards) and
      the world may seem like it's a [ crapsack
      ](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld) , that doesn't
      mean that the worst villain is beyond [ redemption
      ](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn) , or that things
      can't be improved with hard work or even [ The Power of Love
      ](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove) .

      Not to be confused with the [ Golden Ending
      ](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding) in video games,
      where players actually have to [ earn
      ](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameRewards) their happy
      ending. It is possible for both tropes to be in play at the same time,
      however.

      Compare [ Earn Your Bad Ending
      ](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourBadEnding) , the polar
      opposite.

      As this is an ending trope, assume examples will be ** spoilertastic ** .

  I think a more rational Bella would not have wanted to live as an immortal in the body of a teenager.

  And while it has no bearing on their rationality, I didn't enjoy Luminosity, Radiance, Worm, or Pact, at all. Nothing against those who enjoy them, but I find it strange to be in the minority here. I find it even stranger that some of my favorite authors (Elizer, alexanderwales), consider them to be good to great.
  ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    I don't think you're necessarily in the minority, it's just that there are strong in-group/out-group pressures that tend to stop people from commenting and saying that they disliked something, even though that information is valuable and good for conversation. And at the same time, if I liked something *overall*, I don't tend to want to talk about its faults - and if I like it enough, I don't even want to admit that it *has* faults.

    I can understand why someone wouldn't like *Worm*, or *Luminosity*. I'm fairly aware of their faults (though it's been quite a while since I've read the latter), though I do think I have a fairly high tolerance for their particular problems.
    ```

    - u/icarebecause:
      ```
      You are probably right. With all of the stories I mentioned, the *idea* behind the stories sounded great, but I couldn't get into any of them. It has been long enough that I can't recall any specific complaints, but because the premise of each story was so interesting, I've tried each story at least twice. 

      When discussing a story, no matter how much I enjoyed (or didn't enjoy) it, I always try to keep in mind both its merits and its flaws. What I am tired of is the (what seems to me) disproportionate amount of praise that these stories receive on this subreddit.

      When I look at reviews of books and stories  (and anything else for that matter) on Amazon, Goodreads, or FFN, I always look for well-written critical reviews first. These are the reviews that I enjoy reading the most--especially if it's a book that I really enjoyed. Critical reviews spark the most interesting debates--they point out flaws I may have glossed over, and as an author, they help me learn what isn't working in my writing. If it is a review of something I haven't read, they help me decide if I should give the book a chance--can I deal with the flaws that the reviewer has pointed out?

      I understand that these reviews are harder to write, but I have had a hard time finding critical reviews of any of these stories (but especially Worm) anywhere on the web. I would enjoy reading a well-written review that points out both Worm's faults and merits, written by someone who enjoyed the story just enough to finish it. Maybe Worm's length is the problem.

    >I think a more rational Bella would not have wanted to live as an immortal in the body of a teenager.

    I think you may be misremembering. There was a very dangerous window of opportunity there. That was clearly the most rational choice with the information available in that situation. She was in very real existential danger, beyond even that involved in normal, non-immortal life.

    I obviously couldn't say if not getting those sorts of things affected your enjoyment of *Luminosity*, and other fics like it, but it can't have helped.
