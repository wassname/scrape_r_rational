  > Author's Note: So, when I write a reflective chapter like this, where it's very static and not much happens, I never know how it will be received. 

  I wouldn't worry. The quieter moments are where the characters have a chance to develop, without being caught up in "forced" actions to respond to urgently unfolding events.

    Personally, I think reflective chapters like this are required to maintain story flow. They may be more boring, but without them, the story loses its pacing and feels frantic or unstructured.

    I actually enjoyed this chapter a lot - the return of schoolwork and discussion reminded me of why I started reading this series.

  >“You know,” said Davo, “whenever I experience an overwhelming sense of fear and trepidation about the demon you carry around with you, I remind myself how scary and unnerving *you* are. The demon’s probably sitting in a corner hoping you don’t notice it.”

  It's hilarious how true that is. [Do you remember?](http://gravitytales.com/novel/the-good-student/tgs-chapter-25)

  >Nic sat in the dark and smiled, and his smile turned into a soft laugh. He had feared he would be stuck behind the walls of his mind with a demon, but it was also true that the demon was stuck in here with him. Close enough to be studied. And Nic was a good student.

  u/mooderino, since you seem to be following this, do you have any estimates of the book's expected final length? Are we more than halfway to the end? (Unless revealing that would spoiling the story, of course.)

    ```
    It's meant to be an ongoing series over numerous arcs. This arc is well over halfway.
    ```

    - u/Noumero:
      ```
      I see. And the total number of arcs isn't planned?

      That is, the way I see it, the plot seems to have a clear ending condition: resolution of the demonic threat. I assume it would be resolved in finite time, with the conflict not being stretched on and on. If the number of arcs isn't limited by that... Oh, but that would be spoilers, I suppose.

  I was put off it for a while, but I really enjoyed this chapter.

  ```
  I am really enjoying seeing a magical school story where there are competent adults, and there is still reason to focus on studies and schoolwork.

  The discussion was a really good show don't tell moment of what makes 'the good student's such an amazingly good student.

  ```
  All this talk of money makes me wonder about the war between Ranvar and the demons. Arcanum seems to be metaphorical shavings and filings left behind during the minting of magic, so to speak... I wonder what Davo's thesis would be about the demon war?

  I don't think we know enough about demons yet, but I imagine that the War over Value will play a role in the story to come.
