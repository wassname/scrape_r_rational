  ```
  Dungeon Keeper Ami kind of bored me after they moved to the new dungeon. The OCs just seemed kind of generic characterization-wise, and the munchkining felt more like exploiting videogame rules than exploiting real world rules. Like there wasn't any sense of accomplishment when Ami found a new way of breaking them.

  Does it get better? It's good, but the ratio of enjoyment/words lowered too much after that arc for me to keep reading it.
