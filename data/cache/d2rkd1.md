## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding and Writing Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*
* Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is *also* the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  time travel in stories always falls into the trap of people being stupid. what rules would encourage rational time travel? 

  offhand, the biggest problem tends to be one person having time travel and keeping it secret. instead, a corporate lab with a time travel device that consumes a large amount of power makes more sense. a mass (the traveller, their gear, and the time-pod) is sent through time. with enough infastructure, you could build a relay of power supplies through time to extend your range. 

  so, if the Time Corp has a base in a secluded part of north america, and can send things backwards or forwards for a good span of time (10 or 50 years), then they need infrastructure on the site that will still be there. so as they extend backwards, they change history... unless they move to a new base each time. 

  if you travel back in time, you had to set up the infastructure somewhere, and keep it running long enough to matter. if you jump in 50 year intervals, and find that the 50-years-ago base closed after 5 years, you start to look for a threat in 5 years time. 50 years forward, and you can check the records of what will have happened. 

  so, you can easily get a xanatos pileup of operations planning and infastructure. what rational ideas can you add to this line of thought? nuclear war in the future is not that interesting, but a yellowstone eruption would be interesting, and point to a change in base location.

    Time machines are not something that the-powers-that-be would be fine with just existing. With something that powerful, the company should expect to become the center of a massive political conflict - one that there's no guarantee they'll win. And if they don't win, then time travel is useless for them, as whoever gets the machine in the future will have plenty of opportunities to return and ensure their own victory.

    Depending on the mechanics of time travel and the motivations of the users, it could be entirely rational to keep everything hidden. Sorry, I can't explore this any further atm, I'm feeling a bit tired. I am certainly interested in any ideas this thought process leads to.

    I always keep one time travel rule in the back of my mind:

    in non-paradoxical situations that allow causality-violating closed time loops, e.g., future you arriving to insert the password to defuse the bomb that would otherwise kill present you, you have to keep in mind that your own self-awareness is the most likely element to make such a situation too probabilistically unlikely to happen instead of, you know, future you *not* coming to save you because the bomb explodes and kills you.  

    In particular, imagine you are looking at the bomb-defusing terminal. If you *see* your future self arrive, introduce the password, and defuse the bomb, then by the time it's your turn to disable it for your past self, you'll probably keep in the back of your mind all the little details about how your future self did things, like posture, timing, blinks, etc., and you'll be too likely to (even subconsciously) not to it the exact same way, and so the most likely thing to happen is that future you doesn't come to save you from the bomb.

    The take-away is: if you have a time machine but currently unavaliable and are in a situation where future you could save you, position yourself in such a way that you don't notice the particulars of future you's actions (i.e. look away from where you think he'll come from and be), so that your own memories don't jeopardize the chances of him actually coming to save you. Schr√∂dinger's time-travel paradox: the best way to avoid paradoxes is to make sure they aren't obvserved.
