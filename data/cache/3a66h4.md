## [D][BST] You have 2 days to prepare to transport to a land of swords and magic. How do you proceed?

### Post:

It is Friday morning, 7am, and as you're doing whatever you would be (or waking up if you'd normally be asleep), and you suddenly have an awareness than in 48 hours you will travel to a portal located at [set of coordinates located less than 20 minutes away from your home]. Everything located within the portal will be transported along with you.

If you are in any way prevented from entering the portal Sunday morning (such as by getting arrested or otherwise restrained), you will immediately die.

How do you proceed?

  Hm. Things I'd want to bring:

  * Antibiotics and other medical supplies. 
  * Spices and chocolate. They have the best potential for high-value / low mass/volume that I can come up with quickly and have easy access to. 
  * Industrial gems (the ones that are cheap as dirt but look the same). My second shot at good trade goods. 
  * Books. Lots of books. Science, technology, medicine, warfare. Printouts of various Wikipedia articles would work, but I'd also want specific technical manuals. 
  * Weapons. It's nearly impossible to buy high-quality functional edged weapons in the modern era, but we make really good knives, so that would be a place to start -- I suppose a lamb splitter is approximately a short sword. These are mostly for bribes, sale, and arming my companions once I find some.  
  * Camping gear, including fire starters and massive numbers of lighters. 
  * Clothes of various weights -- I have no idea what the weather over there looks like. 
  * Waterproof containers for everything, especially the books. 

  Guns would be nice, but I don't know where I could acquire them quickly. 

  I would also leave notices for family and friends with as much info as I had and any final goodbye messages. 

  Finally, one of the first things I would do is post a message on /r/rational saying "hey, if you were going to be pulled through a portal to fantasyland in 48 hours, what would you do? Oh and, yeah, this is **totally** hypothetical, honest!"

  EDIT: Things I forgot to list


  A wheelbarrow for carrying stuff. A shovel so that I can bury what I don't bring along. Paper and pencils/pens so that I can make a map of where I buried it.

    You'd have to be careful with the gems; the jewelers might discover that they aren't natural.  It might be better to bring some gem unknown to medieval times but cheap to us, if there are any.

      True. Pearls seem like a good candidate; I'm finding prices online of a couple bucks for 80. If you could get overnight delivery that could work well.

      I doubt that medieval jewelers could figure out that artificial rubies or sapphires are artificial.  There seems to be a cheap and an expensive method of making them; reports vary on how much of a difference this actually makes.

    That would work anywhere EXCEPT in /r/rational. (At least the sidebar says it won't work here. Plot armor is still a pretty difficult thing to banish.)

  As an obligatory plug, this week's Weekly Challenge is "Portal Fantasy" so if you have a great story in mind, you can post it there. The thread will go up in ~7 hours from the time of this post. (Edit: [This thread, right here!](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3a7ypf/weekly_challenge_portal_fantasy/))

  I go grab my Kindle, plug it in, and start charging it. I go grab my hand-cranked USB charger from the basement, which gets added to my luggage. I start wiping the Kindle of all unimportant material, and begin loading it down with information, with a focus on technical manuals. I grab a bunch of books on medicine, mathematics, and physics from the 1800s (which will hopefully be less complicated than modern stuff, and won't contain irrelevant information). I go to the store and spend a few hundred dollars from my emergency fund on backups; extra devices, extra cords, extra storage space. I take my laptop too, though battery life is going to be much more of a problem.

  I grab copies of survival books from the bookstore. I already have "How to Survive in the Woods", but I want to grab some of those big, glossy identification guides. In case I'm stuck in the woods, they might save my life. In case I can easily find a city, I can hopefully sell them.

  I go talk to my father-in-law, who collects guns. If I told him the truth, he probably wouldn't believe me (and I probably would have some trouble believing me either, which is part of why I'm minimizing risks in case this is a delusion). Instead, I tell him that I've been looking for a gun and some ammo. I believe in my state (and the next state over) this is the faster route to gun ownership. Ideally, I'm able to acquire a handgun and ammo for myself, and a turn-of-the-century rifle that smiths and craftsmen will hopefully be able to emulate. I also grab a few of my father-in-law's books on the history of firearms and their construction, of which there are many.

  I send out a message on Facebook asking if anyone wants to go on a trip with me. Ideally, some of my friends who play D&D and have an interest in the pseudo-period. Depending on time constraints and how good I am at selling the scenario, I borrow some edged weapons from a friend of mine who does fencing instruction, and a bow and arrows from a friend who does archery.

  I say goodbye to my wife, and tell her that I hope to be home before the baby is born. I also say that there's a good chance that I'm just crazy, in which case I will be home in about an hour.
  ```

  - u/nicholaslaux:
    ```
    I'm mildly confused - you're inviting friends to travel with you, but not your wife? And would she not insist on going with you, if she knew there was a chance of you not returning?
    ```

    - u/alexanderwales:
      ```
      *I'm* only going because I have to. If I didn't think it would literally kill me, I'd stay the heck away from the portal (or just tell my friends about it and let them go if they want to). My wife is on too many medications to last long in a non-modern world, and the odds of dying in childbirth are too great, to say nothing of the infant mortality rates. I hope that she would agree with this assessment, but if we disagreed I would just leave her behind and hope that with time, she would forgive me.

      My friends (or at least, the likely candidates) don't have attachments that would prevent them from leaving, or could bring their attachments with them.

    Some great ideas, I just see one problem: It's a foreign world, so your identification guides could be mistaken at best and totally wrong at worst.  For example, a safe looking mushroom here might be deadly over there

    > bunch of books on medicine, mathematics, and physics from the 1800s

    The problem with this is much of what we thought about medicine prior to (very) roughly 100 years ago was flat out wrong and even harmful. You're better off getting a modern layperson's medical guide (wilderness medical guide or something) plus some medical texts for when you have more time to learn the details.
    ```

    - u/alexanderwales:
      ```
      I'd grab a bunch of stuff from all over the place. The big problem that I foresee with more modern medical texts is that they would tell me to use tools and equipment that I don't have and can't make, or suggest courses of action that aren't available to me given how limited my resources are going to be and how far I am from modern civilization. 19th century might be too far back, but I need some criteria that can give me the best books for my situation.

  **A compilation of people's ideas:**

  **preparation**

  * Learn basic phrases in ancient languages.  Highly unlikely that the world will have any of the same languages, but might as well try.
  * Learn basic survival skills
  * Create posts in numerous forums asking what I should do (wait... is OP doing this? :P )
  * Ask friends and family for supplies (but misleading them on what it will be used for)
  * Set alarms so you wake up on time
  * Leave behind a video of the portal

  **Supplies:** 

  * off-road motorbike (assuming portal is large enough)
  * Solar-powered recharger & hand-cranked recharger
  * Camera
  * Survival Gear
       * Food
       * sleeping bag
       * knife
       * medicine
       * Matches
       * cold and hot weather clothes
       * a inflatable boat, in case portal lands you out somewhere in the ocean (and for rivers)
  * Taser, guns, sword
  * tablet with copy of Wikipedia, and some physical books as backup.
  * Trade goods:
       * Spices, chocolate, pearls, gems
  * Items that might be magical or work against magical creatures:
       * Garlic
       * good-luck charms
       * rare crystals

  **What to do once there**

  * Try to find civilization (follow a stream)
  * Practice meditation & concentration exercises (in case magic is based on willpower)
  * Once in a city, use your knowledge of modern science, rationality, and technology to your advantage.  This could be done either by gaining the support of nobility or by using your trade goods to start a company.

    For the taser, do you actually know a source where you could acquire one within 48 hours? I was initially looking, and finding a source that sells them seemed a bit hard without the internet, given that overnight shipping is likely to be difficult for some more obscure items.

      I presume I could buy one at the local guns shop.  If not, I could order one online and hope it arrives in time (1-2 day shipping)

  My spouse's copy of Pojar. Sword and wand fantasy lands are mostly New Zealand or British Columbia; 50/50 chance that Pojar will tell me what I can eat.

  Antibiotics, definitely. The local pathogens will be entirely unlike anything I've experienced, but on the plus side they won't have developed any antibiotic resistances, so I can just bring a few dozen rounds of penicillin and be good. Unless it's radically different, in which case penicillin won't likely have much effect.

  The tools I need to rough it for a couple weeks. (Trekking poles, backpack, sleeping bag, iodine tablets, camp stove, MREs, spare hiking shoes.) Nobody said I was going to land in the middle of a city, and even if I did, I'd need to get money and get a place to stay. It might take a few days, especially with the potential language barrier (assuming that's not magicked away).

  High-density trade goods. Spices and dyes are a possibility, but most likely people won't trade for an entirely unknown good. Chemistry is probably universal, so I could bring gold and gemstones. (How quickly can I get a large order from [Alternatives Lapidary](https://www.etsy.com/shop/AlternativesLapidary)? Interesting cuts of cheap lab-grown gems means a greater profit margin.) As an obvious foreigner, I expect usurious offers, but it's better than nothing.

  An inconspicuous locking case for my high-density trade goods. My plan is to find a place to hide this, then grab a small subset to sell at any given time.

  Four spare sets of glasses. I'm nearly blind without them.

  A mechanical watch. A sextant, and a guide on how to navigate with it. A compass, just in case this planet has a magnetic field. That should help me navigate, or at least not go in circles.

  I might be able to purchase a firearm in my area without much delay. If I can, I'll get a 9mm and either a Mosin Nagant carbine or a .30-06 with a fair stack of ammunition for each. Maybe a couple thousand rounds. Failing that, a bow and a pistol crossbow. Knives and poison to apply to them -- if I'm attacked, I want to survive, and killing my attackers before they can kill me is an effective way of doing that.

  A knife sharpener. Two, actually: one for the poisoned knives and one for my utility knife. (I don't go anywhere without my utility knife.)

  It would be tough to get them in time, but ideally a set of llamas as pack animals. At least one cart, but I'm not depending on landing by a road. Food for llamas, though they're going to forage for the most part. Equipment to care for llamas. They don't have quite the carrying capacity of a donkey or a horse, but they forage better, and once I settle down, I have wool and milk, which I wouldn't with donkeys. Plus I hear they tend to be a bit stubborn if you try overloading them -- clear communication of bad conditions is good.

  If I can't get llamas, then an ATV with a hitch, a trailer, and gasoline. I'll probably only get 15mpg, but that'll get me a couple hundred miles within the first day, which might mean sleeping in a bed on night 1 rather than a week of roughing it.

  My cryonics medical necklace. I might be heavily deluded about this whole affair. It's not worth the risk of going without it.

  What do you know about the destination? (Swords and magic is pretty vague. Do you mean a high-magic setting, low magic, utility magic or not, medieval, faux medieval, etc?) Do you know how large the portal is, or what kind of limits you have on what you can bring?

  1. A couple of decades worth of my meds. If I can't get those, it probably doesn't matter what else I take.

  2. Physical paper books, maybe 11th edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica if the portal would fit it, as many "how things work" and survivalist medicine and similar volumes as I can fit in the space. And, yeh, some solar powered chargers for my personal electronics but I wouldn't spend a lot of money on them. They won't last more than a few years, books are a different matter.

  3. Food. At least a couple weeks worth.

  4. Trade goods. Gold, silver, maybe jewels if I can afford some.

  5. A couple of firearms and a bunch of ammo. Plus a katana and a shortsword and machete that I already have.

  6. My collection of meteorites and australites, a bunch of other interesting minerals, on the odd chance they're magically effective.

  Edit: the portal seems to be pretty big, so I rent something offroadable and a standalone gas generator and buy a bunch of gas and load everything I own that can fit.

  Edit: and a bat detector that does heterodyne and frequency shifting. [This one by choice](http://www.batbox.com/duet.asp).

    This is why one of my first priorities in a zombie apocalypse scenario is to break into a pharmacy. Of course, medications eventually decay over time, so even then it's sort of chancy.

  I go to the coordinates. If I find the headachy pillars, I call up the Randi million dollar foundation thing, send them a few thousand bucks so they take me seriously (travel costs etc.) and get them here ASAP. With any luck, within 12 hours I have the media, the government and the world's eye on site and its brains thinking on how to address the issue.

  Y'all are doing it way too Gryffindor.

  I grab my girlfriend and maybe some friends.  On 48 hours notice I can probably arrange any of that and paying for flights and promising a buttload of my savings to negate them losing their jobs if I'm wrong is probably fine.  (So long as I'm sure that I'm right, which isn't entirely certain.) 

   I'm grabbing a solar charger guaranteed good for a few years and my kindle, loaded with thousands of books on every topic I might need.  Also that hand-crank charger, and a movement powered watch.  I'm bringing hard copies of any book I want to be able to read/ that I might need when something inevitably happens to the kindle or power supply.  I bring food, because who knows what I might need.  Either I'll have a gun legally or I'll get a friend who owns several to come along.

    I'm buying out large chunks of REI, the grocery store, and places for other supplies and emptying those gas-stationthings of ice.  I'm renting a lare truck or several to get these on location.  I know how to ride, and I'm not horrible with a saber, so I'll pick up at least one horse and a sword, It's possible that I'll just rent some time on the horses from a stable if I'm low on cash.  I know they have insurance, and one of the stables is looking to downsize anyways, I'll pick those horses. 

   I've got an acquaintance who used to be a professional blacksmith.   He's a bit of a handful, but I'll probably bring him and all of his forge supplies.  I may or may not be out of money by now, but as my best friends are along for the ride, they sure as shit aren't.   We'll bring at least one sailboat as both my best friend, and my HS best friend, who will probably come, are accomplished sailors.  With some overlap, the party will include: an economics graduate with a specialty in industrial organization and development, a geological exploitation economist, several computer programmers in case magic turns out to be a Rick Cook type of thing, Several sailors, a blacksmith, A guy with grad degrees in sociology and math, a medieval combat and weapons specialist, a military history buff who knows his Japanese weaponry, a food prep specialist most of the way through a zoology degree, the former commander of a military academy, an electrical engineer, and a civil engineer.  Those are within 7 people for those who want to keep count.  Core party.  I will also be bringing my gf and few jack-of all trades types, plus a close friend or two with no relevant specialties we will just want to keep around.  All of our spare,currency, stocks and credit will be converted to gold.

  My gf has a psychology and art background which might come useful.  she should also bring some of her friends as my core 7 are all male, and only a few of the jack of all trades types are women.  Call the party size about 30 as we can add a few current or former IDF members to that list and it seems stupid not to.

  I can shoot a bow, ride a horse, and use a sword.  My  Isreali relatives are all MDs, and former IDF as that shit is mandatory service.   We are bringing lots of medical supplies including any likely prescription meds, courtesy of the Israeli doctors. The blacksmith loves to get super drunk and is huge.  We've got a bi eagle scout who is multi-lingual (if that matters), engineers, etc.  Anything the world wants to throw at us we can handle, at least with some cross training of knowledge  unless it involves magic.  We can cross-train for anything necessary.  Only the Israeli doctors are in their 30s, the rest span from 19-29.  Might make a decent fantasy novel.

  EDIT: It was pretty close anyways, but edits are successive ninjas after realizing that this was in r/rational.
  EDIT: Definitely a bunch of horses in case the trucks don't work, probably some wagons.  if the portal isn't big enough, then supplies to build a few wagons.
  Edit:might as well swap cars with my sister, trading my 2011 for her 2007 4WD SUV.

  First, I set multiple alarms for 4:00, 5:30, and 5:40 on that day (setting my deadline to be at the portal at 6:00), though I'll probably be jittery enough that just the 4:00 one will suffice. Knowing me, I won't be able to get any sleep Saturday night, even though it isn't very good to be tired when going into unfamiliar territory.

  Then I find out whether I'm allowed to camp at the site of the portal. If so, then I do that. If not, then I don't want to risk the police evicting me from the area.

  Without knowing anything more about the land I'll be transported to, I don't know what I need to take with me, so I'll default to taking everything that I'd take on a backpacking trip (perhaps a bit heavier than usual on the medical supplies), plus books and guns. Books are good because they are a cheap way of carrying a lot of intellectual value that may or may not already exist on the other side, but with a diverse selection of books I'm more likely to have something that'll be of value on the other side than if I were to take any other good. The guns are to protect my interest in that value, though they may be useless on the other side, so I also take a number of blades. I'm probably less than useless in a blade fight and I don't have time for medieval military training, so I'm banking more on the guns. I don't have the resources to take any useful set of any more advanced technology (except in book form), and I don't want to risk stealing anything, so I'm limited to what my meagre savings can buy in a small town. 

  I can't bring any sort of ebook reader since 2 days isn't enough time for someone in my position to obtain a sufficient portable power supply for such a thing and time I'd spend setting it up is time wasted that I could have spent on gathering hard copy books.

  It doesn't matter that I can't obtain gold or silver since it is unlikely that a particular arbitrary metal is of any value on the other side.
