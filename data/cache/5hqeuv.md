## [D] Sunday Writing Skills Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Sunday thread for discussions on writing skills!

Every genre has its own specific tricks and needs, and rational and rationalist stories are no exception. Do you want to discuss with your community of fellow /r/rational fans...

* Advice on how to more effectively apply any of the [tropes](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RationalFic)?

* How to turn a rational story into a rationalist one?

* Get feedback about a story's characters, themes, plot progression, prosody, and other English literature topics?

* Considering issues outside the story's plain text, such as titles, cover design, included imagery, or typography?

* Or generally gab about the problems of being a writer, such as maintaining focus, attracting and managing beta-readers, marketing, making it free or paid, and long-term community-building?

Then comment below!

Setting design should probably go in the Wednesday Worldbuilding thread.

  In my story, a protagonist is experimenting with time-travel abilities and I want to demonstrate the scientific method by showing how real-life researchers might investigate time-travel.

  What are some particularly important experimental protocols and investigation are people interested in seeing being used?

  So far, I have:

  * multiple hypotheses being generated ahead of time to cover varying possibilities before attempting to prove or disprove any single hypothesis

  * experiments to falsify a hypothesis rather than only looking for confirming evidence

  * reading and summarizing information from the background literature in the relevant fields to better plan the experiments

  * detail extensive planning for a rigorous experimental protocol to avoid bias, errors, and false positives/negatives

  * show the protagonist being wrong and updating their hypothesis in the face of new evidence (or completely throwing out their prior guess)

  Does anyone have any other ideas? Some helpful suggestions could be styles of investigation such as cautious vs fast-paced, many possibilities vs one hypothesis, complex experiments with redundancies vs simple experiments, and so on.

  PS If people want to tailor their feedback based on the power being investigated, it's a device which has a screen to only show text and a keyboard. It sends messages back in time, but the researchers have found out that whatever appears on the screen (ex. "This is a time machine!") will end up as the very next thing the researchers type into the device.

    I would throw in the pre experiment step of thinking about possible dangers of the experiment. A little Health and Safety assessment would go a long way in most time travel plots :-)

    Randomization is important, find something you don't know beforehand, so the device is giving you new information.

    I'm not sure if this is proper peer review, but give the data to someone who has not been working on your project, to see if that leads them to the same conclusion. It can be too easy to be locked into a solution.

    Science is largely a collective process. Individual hypothesis generation and experimentation is quite a different process, and you'll have to face that unless this time travel device is going to become a worldwide phenomenon.

    For instance, if you're given a study about some phenomenon, and the sample size is relatively low, it doesn't mean much to you, because of how it got to you and positive reporting bias, its almost meaningless to have something like that put in front of you. Academia is a huge machine designed to report anomalies. You don't start getting reliable information till you can do a metastudy of replication attempts.

    But if you have a particular phenomenon and you want to investigate, and you do, and you get a single positive result, n=1, that's already meaningful to you, because there was far less bias in the flow of the information. The scientific network is biased towards reporting interesting results, but if you randomly select a sensible test and a sensible testing apparatus, those individually will have no bias towards interesting results at all.

    So if this is a story about a single researcher working alone, for themselves, especially if they're the only person who has access to the phenomenon, its going to look very different to Science as we know it.

    Just a brief thought (no clue if it actually  makes sense though):

    How about building a device that's only purpose is to determine whether you fucked up causality and wiped out a timeline? Design it such that it's your first foray into time travel at all. And it communicates with the version of itself you take into the past. But it's ahead of itself by a few seconds. Then, before you take a time travel trip, you check the device. If it's still pinging itself, then you know your trip won't alter things enough to prevent the device's conception. So the trip you're about to take hasn't impacted your general sphere of causality. It serves as a rudimentary, first response sort of safety measure.

    Reading that back, I have almost no idea how any of what I wrote makes a shred of sense. But I'm not erasing it. So....Yea. Hope this helps? :)
