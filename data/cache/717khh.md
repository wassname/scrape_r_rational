## [FF] [WIP] The Brightest Witch and the Darkest House

### Post:

[Applied Cultural Anthropology](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6xcti4/applied_cultural_anthropology_chapter_19_a_harry/) was posted recently, which I enjoyed. At the Spacebattles thread someone asked for similar stories and this one was mentioned. The story is planned to cover the full seven years of Hogwarts in three consecutive books; the first is complete and the second is somewhere in the middle of the fourth year:

- [The Brightest Witch and the Darkest House](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11280068/1/The-Brightest-Witch-and-the-Darkest-House) - Complete, 270k words
- [The Hogwarts Six and The Darkest Wizard](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11677935/1/The-Hogwarts-Six-and-The-Darkest-Wizard) - Active, 160k words

The premise of the story is that Hermione is replaced by a muggleborn OC with a vastly different personality (Valeria Cambell), who is written as a Level 2 Intelligent Character. The story largely adheres to the Stations of the Canon except where Valeria's actions cause it to diverge, though it doesn't overly belabour familiar plot points. Characters other than Valeria stick closely to their canon characterization, but the writer generally does a passable job of having them plausibly act according to their internal goals and beliefs, and explores this through the use of multiple POVs. A notable exception is Voldemort: it remains to be seen whether he has more agency than as a plot device.

I do not know if the author has read HPMOR, but Valeria bears at least a passing resemblance to HJPEV and a number of apparent inconsistencies in the magical world are similarly explored or at least noted (e.g gold/silver value exploitability, are snakes sentient?, the morality of Azkaban, death as the "next great adventure"), though sometimes with a different explanation.

Valeria is not a psychopath, however she exhibits an exceptional propensity to violence and cruelty towards her enemies, and indifference towards the law except for being constrained by the need to not get caught. Her principle guiding motivation is that she sees magic as her inalienable birthright as a witch -- all magic, including the Dark Arts -- and is opposed by those who reject her right to learn magic at all (many of her housemates in Slytherin along with Voldemort and his supporters) as well as those who would restrict what she can learn (the Ministry and Hogwarts faculty).

Her opposition to Voldemort aligns her with Harry Potter and his allies in Gryffindor, and motivates her to ruthlessly and intelligently exploit her resources to acquire power. This is generally done plausibly with respect to her abilities and the exploitability of the magical world. A developing theme is whether her growing abilities in the Dark Arts will eventually pose a genuine threat to the magical world on the level of Voldemort, and how this is responded to by characters such as Dumbledore, Snape and Harry.

  I read the first chapter, which isn't awful but isn't all that great, either, especially from a technical standpoint. How much does the writing improve, in terms of writing proficiency? 

  EDIT: Have read a few more chapters, would not recommend it to others.

    The first few chapters are rather awkward, especially in the dialogue. I think this is mostly a product of the author trying to condense down pre-Hogwarts events and get to the main story. It improves considerably when the story reaches Hogwarts, with better pacing and dialogue. Or, at least, after that point it was rare for the quality of the writing to get in the way of my enjoyment of the story, and sections where that happens are relatively short.

      Thank you. I'll skim through the pre-Hogwarts chapters, read a couple more past that point, and update my comment for the sake of others who pass by this thread.

        Ok, I read through year one. I’ll comment here in case anybody was going to check back.

        I don’t think it got better, it was pretty hard to read and I probably won’t read anymore. My two biggest complaints are (spoiler free):

        * I wouldn’t consider this a rational story at all. The few points of rational-style writing are more like “here’s something weird about Harry Potter and I’m going to pick on it” with no real underlying thread of characters actually being fleshed out and motivated to understand the underlying world, and the plot is written in service of what the author thought might be interesting than actually being reasoned out as different people working to their own ends.

        * Dialogue is incredibly awkward throughout. This is probably the worst pet peeve of mine, not sure if this bothers other people as much. Conversations just go in incredibly weird directions, rather than being a natural extension of the characters and the situation.

          Woo, /u/PositivePeter taking one for the team! 

          Dialogue is a huge pet peeve of mine as well. I can ignore it if there's really good worldbuilding, because tbh my ideal story is really just a travel guide or history book or something (my main complaint with Arrival was that there wasn't enough infodumping about Weird Alien Stuff), but otherwise, the dialogue is important.

    I second this comment.

    It gets slightly worse imo. I've read a lot of this story.
    ```

- u/JackStargazer:
  ```
  I'm justifiably wary of any story with a description that starts with 'X Canon character is replaced by a much more competent OC who is just great at everything.'
  ```

  - u/rty275:
    ```
    That's a fair complaint, and, when worded that way, it does sound bad, but that exact description also fits HPMOR, the name of the OC  is just changed less. I think it would be remiss to ignore this on that basis at least.
    ```
