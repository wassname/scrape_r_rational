  I wonder, is this a deconstruction of the original series or an extension of it? I really loved Avatar and thought the characters, world building and plot were very well done. I'd be interested in reading this story, but I'm not sure how I'd feel if it tries to change everything to fix a few flaws.

    Thanks for the comment. If I had to make a comparison this story would be to Avatar what HPMOR was to Harry Potter. I looked up the definition of deconstruction and while I’m not trying to actively inspect the fundamentals of the story, I am doing a revision of the story that has much more world building and by the end I believe you’ll be satisfied in the direction this story is aiming toward. My first and foremost principle is keeping the characters the same as much as possible. I also love the show and it’s characters and I try to make sure to aim for their characterizations. 

    However, the motives and goals of some characters have changed. Iroh is working for the White Lotus trying to sabotage the Fire Nation. Kanna, Katara’s grandmother, also has an active role. To what end I can say without giving away the story.

    In the end I’m aiming towards an expansion of the story but if there is some deconstruction along the way that’s fine for me. Overall, the character arcs will be the same except for some few and as a result the plot will have to accommodate that. Hope that answers your questions. Please let me know if you have anymore.

      I haven't read your story yet, just wanted to point out that Itoh was working with the white Lotus in the series too but was planning to reform the fire nation through teaching Zuko.

        I’d argue Ozai would definitely class what Iroh was doing with the WL as sabotage and treason - it’s all quite relative.

          I would too, if only because ozai was very much authoritative/tyrannical.
