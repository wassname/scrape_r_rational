  Well, things are certainly heating up. One thing that confuses me, though--how can Ray be sure that Mama will even realize he's burning, much less be able to react before he dies?  Even though he plans to die anyway, the whole point is to distract her with trying to save him, right? So, wouldn't it have made more sense for him to light himself in front of her?
  ```

    Was just thinking this. From the moment he starts burning he's no longer a prime delicacy. No point in mama trying to rescue him. Maybe more effective if he trapped himself with flame and shouted for her?

      While it *would* be better to do so, his plan is still salvageable. His brain is still there, after all. Mama can still put out the fire and keep him alive long enough to extract the part that matters.

        This may just have been the kids' guess, but it sounded like they were only considered perfect cuisine if they weren't damaged or sick. It's not just the brain, but the presentation.
        ```

          Let's take a look at most likely the only page where we see the actual [demon cousine](http://mangastream.com/r/neverland/007/3682/19). It's a *soup*. Of course, it was also considered low-quality food, but it shows how they can eat processed food. Could humans be processed, fixing their "presentation"? Possibly.

          On the other hand, demons *are* interested in [human meat](http://mangastream.com/r/neverland/001/3577/42), not just the brain. So I see how it would be a problem for them. 

          Still. It's a feast of highest quality, and the [best part of the child is their brain](http://mangastream.com/r/neverland/003/3625/9). However, considering that it's a feast for some eldritch horror, they might not accept anything below perfection...

          In the end, we know too little of the demons to say for sure what, if any, damage to their meals they can accept.

    Also, given that they plan to escape, so Isabella needing to contact HQ as a check-in no longer matters, why don't they just burn Isabella?
    ```

    - u/CeruleanTresses:
      ```
      All the caregiver personnel have heart monitors that alert HQ if they die, so killing her unfortunately isn't an option.

    He doesnt actually need to buen himself, he only needs to cover himself in oil and be in front of her m, saying that if she approaches him he will burn himself, if she thinks its a bluff and is going to watch the other kids  Ray can just burn himself. 

    Also why is burning himself necessary?, he could  incapacitate mama and it would accomplish the same thing, and Ray has a lot of information about what kind of things the demons can supply and how the transmissors work, and he hasn't told everything he knows to Emma.
    ```

  That is *nearly* certainly a guaranteed death. The "save *all* kids" plan is now literally impossible. Or is it? 

  I mean, Norman is most likely still alive (his surprise at the end of [chapter 30](http://mangastream.com/r/neverland/030/4093/19) suggesting so), and we heard Emma's spiel enough times for it to have some importance.
  ```

  - u/callmebrotherg:
    ```
    Even if Norman's still alive, at least Ray is almost certainly dead. It isn't quite Anyone Can Die-tier, but at least major characters can be killed off one way or another.
    ```

      >I must have taken leave of my *senses*, I can't imagine what I was thinking. Just because someone said that his body was found burned to a *crisp*, I can't imagine why I would have thought he was *dead*.
      ```

    - u/PurposefulZephyr:
      ```
      We don't know if they *will* be killed, though.

      Ray is not dead yet. His plan banks on him surviving, at least for a moment to distract Mama. After that? He might as well live, if terribly disfigured. 

      Is the chance of that ridiculously small? Yeah. But we still have that "golden" ending available, so who knows.

  Huh switched to imgur. Did our old host stop doing it?

    Nope, this is an early release from a separate group.

  *Holy shit*
