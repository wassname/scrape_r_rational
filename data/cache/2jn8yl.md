  Korra is a brat like in canon, but other than that it has very rational characters. I particularly like how it deals with bending and the Avatar state. Written by our very own /u/writingathing, though he thinks it's not rational when it clearly is.

  The author would like to submit that if this is rational/ist fiction, then anything is, [but apparently saying that makes seraphnb unhappy so](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apophasis) [I](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=douchebag) [won't.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apophasis)
