  SIEGE OF HOGWARTS

  VOLDEMORT THRESHOLD CROSSED

  GET HYPE

  Okay I *love* that Hogwarts is where the climactic siege against the Concept will occur. Magic has so many interesting avenues of offense and defense-- Sean had a brilliant thought with his sensory modification,  but of course Mad-Eye can just false memory charm you to stick the image directly into your head.

  Dumbledore was able to ward against the meme because Hogwarts is impregnable by longstanding narrative convention. But the Concept is evolving at the speed of thought here because it's all but melded with magic.

  Pensieves are a smart solution, scaling it up is gonna be tough. I enjoy the challenge set out here (for Sean, Haley, and FormerlySarsaparilla) and look forward to seeing this ultimate showdown of ultimate destiny. 

  Also SEAN AND HALEY ARE BACK TOGETHER

  I still love the Concept a lot. It's got Mad-Eye, Merlin and Holmes,  and I can't wait to see how those three navigate this siege.

  Every single chapter makes me giggle when some new weird crossover or team up happens. This chapter was no exception.

  That's... actually not a terrible idea, mainly because the SCP universe is explicitly designed for many narrators and continuities. All they have to do is find someone to write a Tale about Site-1000, where all the most useful anomalies and none of the dangerous ones are stored.

    They've got a bunch of antimemetic stuff...because there's memes worse than the Concept.
