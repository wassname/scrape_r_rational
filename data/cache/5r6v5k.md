  In case this was unintended: I have no idea what the hell happened there. Of course, I'm bad with names so that might contribute.
  ```

    ```
    Villain's fingers got cut off to prevent the precog touching him and compromising villain opsec.

    Little bit disappointed. I thought the villains were chrono-phantoms that could only inhabit unrealizable futures.  A kind of precog nemesis.  I guess they could still be timewalkers of some sort.

  ```
  The end did confuse me. Who attacked who?! Who is dead or hurt? Is it Akvo, or was Akvo doing the hurting?
  ```

    The ending is intended to be unclear because we're in Hannah's head right now and a lot happened, very quickly, so she's as confused as you are. 

    However, I apparently still messed up, because if the text isn't clear enough on the fact that it's *supposed* to be unclear, and why, then I didn't write it well enough. Sorry about that. >:P

    tagging /u/FeepingCreature to avoid double-posting.

      ```
      If it's meant to be confusing it's fine; I was just noting it to be safe.
      ```

    - u/eltegid:
      ```
      It's fine, it conveys the fact that a lot of things happened fast and the situation is confusing. I was just noting the fact, like FeepingCreature. The questions were more to start discussion than for you, I think, sorry I got it all mixed up :)
