  Notable mainly for the treatment of the vast combat power gap between eg. trained adults and teenagers.  When Ginny dies in the Chamber of Secrets, the trio decide to dedicate their lives to gaining enough power to survive when Voldemort inevitably decides they need to die.  

  And it's awesome.

    how often does it update?
    ```

      ```
      Fourteen chapters in seven years, mostly at the start - but it's just come off hiatus, so hopefully more often?  "Not regularly" might be the best answer.

  Totally irrelevant to anyone but me, but according to my history I read up to chapter 12 in this story in October but boy do I not remember it at all.
