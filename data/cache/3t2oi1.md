## [Q][META] /r/wisdom moderator casting call, attempt #2

### Post:

I [previously posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3ro8tq/qmeta_i_own_rwisdom_what_should_i_do_with_it/) looking for a new mod for /r/wisdom. The person who stepped up hasn't been in contact with me, and seems to have deleted their Reddit account.

(To that person: if you deleted your account out of a sense of being in over your head with this, and feeling too anxious to stand up and say you didn't want the responsibility after allâ€”don't worry about it, I've been there too. No harm done.)

Anyway, let's try this again: who has a good idea for /r/wisdom, and enough spare time and [spoons](http://www.butyoudontlooksick.com/articles/written-by-christine/the-spoon-theory/) to invest in making that idea a reality?

  Huh, it looks like the really bad posts there get downvoted but there aren't enough good ones to draw attention away from them. Neat!

  Well, I'd like to be a moderator, but mostly just to screw around with some mod abuse for a few days then fuck off, so you should probably just ignore me.

    Your honesty is probably appreciated.

    Back when lots of people left for Voat, I volunteered as a /v/science mod.

    God fucking damn it the number of idiots who kept posting conspiracy theories about Jews controlling the world and Africans not being the same species and proof of crystal healing being suppressed by THE ESTABLISHMENT.

    It didn't help that we couldn't ban people from a single sub back then, so we had to pester the admin about booting the whole account.
