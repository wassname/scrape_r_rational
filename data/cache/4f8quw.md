  So here's the website for Robin Hanson's new book. I'm just letting people here know about it so they get the chance to pre-order it before May 1st.

  For those of you who don't remember him, he's one of the people whose name you'd frequently hear whenever you read about Yudkowsky's professional work.

  Here's a link to [The Hanson-Yudkowsky AI-Foom Debate](https://intelligence.org/ai-foom-debate/).

  It's not rational fiction, but it's a (text)book I think a lot of people here would be interested in checking out.

  i'm pretty sure this isn't moral

  you're making copies of real people and enslaving millions of them so the real-real people don't have to work

    Just pointing out that I'm not the author of the book (because you using the pronoun "you're") and he's not saying that people should be behaving the same way as an em.

    However he does seem to...*gloss* over the more disturbing aspects, as if he's saying that we shouldn't judge them. So I sort of agree with you, but I'm planning on buying and reading the book to see if there's better reasons/phrasing which support his arguments.

      i was using you're in terms of "hypothetically, you (the reader) are a person who is implementing these ideas"

      i'll also admit i didn't make it more than halfway down the page so um

      yeah, i'm sure it's an interesting book though

      That's not what he's doing. If you've ever heard him speak (especially in front of more left-leaning audiences), he always points out that he's in the predicting business, not the judging business. In other words, he lays out what he considers to be the likely consequences of ems, regardless of what people may think of their moral implications 

      The thing is, as far as I can tell his prediction given ems is thus: humanity being succeeded by trillions of copies of increasingly dumbed-down emulations of a few thousand previously-living humans living on subsistence wages in a hyperspeed race to the bottom.

        calling /u/DocFuture because this topic is depressing, a highly predicted failure state that his (fictional) work is actively confronting, in hope he has something, positive please, to contribute.
