## Anybody want to try to help break and/or analyse my magic system for a rational story I'm going to be writing? [BST] [D]

### Post:

**Ice, Water, Steam.**

Water is *important.* It’s the basis of life, and unique in both how well it dissolves things as well as having being in all three forms of matter commonly. So, my magic system is based on the three states of water, with some inspiration take from Avatar, Brandon Sanderson’s ideas on hard magic, and some physical laws.

**Cultures.**

Somewhat like in avatar, there’s three main cultures, one for each state of water. The ice people are in the north, water is in the temperate regions, and steam is more tropical, as you might expect.  Each culture has different names for their specific magic users, but the general term is Conduits.  Additionally, each nation has different percentages of conduits, but due to different population sizes, has almost the same total numbers.  Steam has the most, with almost 95% of them being one, but have the smallest population.  Ice has around 65%, and Water has only 20%, with almost all the aristocracy and soldiers being one.  

There is a genetic marker for each phase, but most people in each nation have it, though not all. Someone, even if they have two or three of the genetic marker, can only have one of them activate, and once that happens, they're stuck with that for life. The primary factor for someone becoming a Conduit is enough exposure to the given phase at an early enough age, with exposure meaning having it around them in a fairly big radius. The steamlanders live in hollow trees that has a steady flow of steam from a  geothermal vent passing through it, so they get the most exposure. The ice people live on either permafrost or ice sheets, but spend less time handling ice closely, so they have the second highest rates. The water aristocrats have cottoned on to this, so they've actually managed to eradicate the vast majority of the open water among their lands, while keeping their castles full of bath's and pools, in order to keep their power base. If enough open water was around, the water commoners would have a much higher rate of Conduits.

**Ice**


Each phase has two abilities, two different but somewhat related things that a conduit can access. For ice, the two abilities are personal stasis and being able to turn ice chunks into memory palaces that you can think in without having time pass in the outside world. The Ice nation is the most modern nation, set up as parliamentary democracy, and just starting to develop airships and decent guns.   


Stasis is relatively straightforward, touch a piece of ice, and make parts or all of you utterly invincible, but also immovable. Whatever you stasis gets a silvery, icy sheen. You choose how long the stasis will last, when you activate it, so with a big chunk of ice, you could stasis yourself for years. You can’t affect clothing or anything you’re holding, limiting turning thin string into an impossibly sharp blade. If you stasis your forearm, you can punch with it, but the impact might hurt your elbow somewhat, from transmitted force. If you stasis your whole arm, this will be mitigated, but punching is going to be quite hard. If you stasis all of yourself, you will become immovable by anything, even gravity, but you won’t be able to see what’s happening.


(Funny aside, in the novel this is going to be for, the Ice people needed a wall for their main city because of some really scary wild animals, so for many generation, when someone is about to die, they instead are taken to the wall, and stasis themselves for ten thousand years or so, while standing next to or on top of other old people. The whole wall is made out of octogenarians stacked liked bricks.)

When you stasis, some of the ice sublimates, based on how long the stasis will last and how much of your body is stasising, with more time using more of the ice. You could stasis your whole body for a minute with an ice cube, to give an idea of how much ice is needed.

The iceputers are incredibly useful, at the cost of your memories. When an Ice person, touches a piece of ice, they can load a memory into it, turning it silvery and making it incapable of changing temperature A bigger piece of ice would require a longer memory, and you can't pull memories back out. Once activated, the user can send their mind inside it and view any memories. Inside it, time doesn't pass outside, giving you time to think, find any relevant information, and also look outside through the block to plan what you're going to do. When you spend time inside one, some of the ice will sublimate when you come out, based on how much time you spent inside, until the ice block is all gone.  This gives you a limit on how much time you can spend there, as well as making it so memories have to be relearned if you want to transfer them to a new piece of ice. So, in the middle of a fight, if someone was punching you, you could activate a piece of ice that's touching your skin somewhere, figure out the best way to block the punch, and then go back into real time and continue. Alternatively, you could simply have a really big piece of ice at home to give yourself far more time to think and plan and design. For this reason, the ice culture has the most advanced science of the three, since their geniuses simply have way more time to think. However, the limitation of having to put memories in means that if used too much, a person can run into problems based around not really knowing who they are super well. Journals are very popular in their culture.

**Water**


The water kingdoms would be the most traditionally fantasy culture, with the aristocracy and upper classes being made up of Conduits, fighting other water kingdoms and using their aerial superiority to stop the Ice and Steam people from trading.   Their two abilities are a “shadow” of water that they can use to propel themselves, and enhanced senses based on the amount of water in the air.


If you’ve read Worm, think of Leviathans water shadow, but with some important differences. If you haven’t, imagine that when you move, water in the exact position you were just in appears behind you, coming out of your skin. Swing your arm horizontally and you would create for a split second a table made out of water, before gravity takes over. Furthermore, Newton’s Third Law applies to this. The force from the water appearing will propel you forward. Thankfully, for normal life, the shadow only appears if you’re going really fast, around 25 MPH, right up towards the limits of human sprinting, and also have water in contact with your body. Because of this, water Conduits have to be in very good physical shape to reach this limit on flat ground, and spend a lot of time practicing sprinting. Once the shadow kicks in, because of it pushing you faster,  more water has to be produced in order to to fill the greater space you're occupying every second. This in turn leads to more acceleration, which means more water and so on. This feedback loop lets you fly, once you've gotten up to speed, being propelled by a massive tail of water. 

While by default the water will come out of the back of any body part moving forward, with enough practice and mental skill, you can choose to limit it to certain places, even places on the front side of you. The amount of water you have to work with is based only on speed and total cross section, so that in a superman pose, you make less water than if you flew standing upright. However, a superman pose has far less air resistance, so it might actually be faster. The ability to choose where the total amount of water comes out of also lets you do things like make a short range hydraulic cutting jet, if going fast enough, by channeling the total amount of pressure out the tip of your pinky finger. You can steer and maneuver by channeling various amounts out of your hands and feet Thankfully,  the water that this produces sticks around for 5 minutes, and then vanishes, which helps stop the world from drowning. 


The enhanced senses require touching water, and activating it would freeze it. The faster you freeze the water, the better your senses become. At a rate of freezing a cup of water in a minute, your eyes would work better, your ears could hear more, and things would generally be sharper. Freeze it in 5 seconds, and your senses would be far, far sharper, with additional benefits such as simply knowing where things are around you, like the Byakugan from Naruto. Having more water in the air around you makes this more efficient, letting you get away with freezing your water slower. This means that in a battle, the water shadow is really useful for simply saturating the air with water, and if it’s raining, it’s amazing for them.


**Steam**


The Steam lands, or vapor lands, have massive, Hollow Trees that grow around geothermal vents that spew out hot steam. They live in small tribes that live in each tree, and almost everyone is a Conduit. Their two abilities are based around manipulating heat and speed, which are really the same thing, and are by far the most related of the three cultures.

**Heat and Speed**


The Steamlanders can channel heat through themselves and into an enclosed container of water or steam. This means that as long they’re touching a container, they can sit in a fire, or a geothermal heat vent and and be completely unharmed, as long as their container doesn't burst from too much pressure. They can also keep the heat inside of them, in specific places, but their bodies radiate heat far faster than a container, making them not ideal for storing purposes. Once heat is in a container, as long as is there is steam inside it, they can pull the heat out of it and put it back into their body. When all the heat is gone, it obviously turns into water, which can’t have heat pulled out of it. Using this, they can make their hands hot enough to melt through metal, if they have enough heat, which is fairly useful in combat, especially combined with their second ability.

When they store heat in their body, wherever they store it gets sped up, with the degree based on the amount of heat stored. The most useful place to store heat, then, is the head, since you can speed up your thinking, which translates to everything seeming to happen far slower. If you also have heat stored in the rest of your body, you can speed it up too, but you have to be very careful, as the body is not designed for moving that quickly and it’s very easy to break or hurt yourself. It’s called scalding, when you speed up your thoughts, and it makes the steamlanders very dangerous in up close combat, since they can casually dodge everything until they can burn you with hands that are glowing red, or just beat the shit out of you. The Steamlanders are dark skinned, from living in the south, so the heat shows up along places where blood is close to the skin, such as major arteries and eyes. This is also a drawback to scalding, since having too much heat next to your eye’s makes everything blurry and hard to see, and it get’s worse the more heat you have in your head.  You can try to hold as much heat as you want, but the more you have, the faster it'll radiate off, and there's steadily increasing diminishing returns in terms of speed. 


So, try to see if I made any stupid mistakes, and if everything seems roughly balanced.  Thanks.

  Is there any effort to gain magic users of a different type for each race? Water aristocrats seeking out ice conduits say.

  It sounds like an interesting system.  A few questions:

  Stasising parts of my body, what are the limits?  Apparently If I stasis my forearm I can still move it, does the same apply if I stasis my skin for example, perhaps leaving unstasised parts at the joints if flexibility would become an issue?

  With the memory storage, can you store memories generated while in an ice memory palace in another memory palace?  If I am a scientist and I sit in my giant ice palace for hundreds of years thinking and doing mental research, learning all sorts of cool stuff, can I then make another memory palace that contains that entire experience and my memory of it and then  work in there for an even longer time?  Seems dangerous that potentially something that creates memory (time to think) is also part of the fuel for the power. 

  How does the water shadow and water sense interact.  Can I freeze my enormous water shadow quickly to gain insane senses?

  With the 25 mph limit: I can move my hand or foot at 25 mph with little difficulty.  Would it be possible to use this method to create shadows instead of sprinting?

  The heat storage seems interesting but so limited and vulnerable.  The sorts of pressure vessels that can hold large amounts of steam are very heavy, and I wonder how limited these guys would be by that.  Especially if they are vulnerable to their own movement, moving something small that weighs 50 pounds or more at any sort of high speed is super dangerous.

  Anyway it all sounds pretty awesome, there's a lot more questions to ask I suppose but I have to go.  Have fun!

    Thanks for all the feedback, this is awesome.  

    So, stasis.  From a conduit's perspective, it feels like they touch a piece of ice, pull the "essence" of it inside them, and then shove it into whatever body part's they want.  If they want it stasis'd longer, they shove more into that part.  Once they shove it, depending on how much they need, some of the ice will poof into vapor. They have some control, but not enough to choose specifically skin on the arms but not on the joints.  With practice and meditation, they can get better at specific regions, but there's still an upper limit.

    For the iceputers(I'm sad I can't use that name in the book), that is a very very good point.  I think I'm going to change it so that you can't remember your time inside it, but you do keep what amounts to gut feelings and hunches based on your time there.  For example, you're in a forest, examining some mushrooms, unsure if ou should eat them, so you go into your iceputer where you've stored memories of learning about poisonous fungi. You study it for a bit, and then come back out, not remembering the studying, but still having the gut feeling that eating the one with red dots is a really bad idea.  If you spent a year inside one working on some math problems, you might come out with the feeling that you were on the right track, and when you try to solve it in the real world, you would have leaps of intuition that you wouldn't have had otherwise.   That way, they still can use it for combat (Duck!), and it doesn't equal god mode technology instantly. 

    Can't believe I didn't see the senses and the shadow. This is what happens when you keep on changing things constantly without having it written down.  I'm going to go with yes.  However, on an other comments suggestion, I'm changing the water shadow so that instead of making infinite water that disappears, a water conduct must instead suck up fresh  (I'll say salt messes with the required purity, but that's mostly so theres still oceans) water by touching it, at which point it get's moved to hammerspace, waiting to get used. However, the feedback when you try to do the senses thing with the water from your personal stash, fucks up your water shadow big time, and it stops working for a couple minutes.  Plus, all that water used at the same moment will be roughly like setting off a flashbang in front of your face. Too much information is not a good thing.  So it's possible, but difficult and dangerous.  

    With the water shadow and the speed limit, yes, it is possible, it's just generally a bad idea, unless you have insane amounts of practice.   For instance, if you swing your arm fast enough, water will come out of your stash, at which point your arm gets pushed forward even faster.  If you have a sword and you're swinging it, this can work, but otherwise, you the unbalanced force will probably just knock you on your ass, if it doesn't break your arm when it accelerates at a bad angle. A grand master might be able to do some pretty kickass martial arts using that though, crazy flying kick leaps and shit.  With enough practice, you might even be able to redirect that  water from the punch into a cutting jet, but well, it's alright if a story has some incredibly badass villains. 

    Heat storage and then I should really go to bed.   Yeah I've been thinking about that, and I'm kinda unsure what to do.  I might give their tree's big ass seeds that are incredibly pressure resistant, while still being relatively light and come filled with mostly water.  That feels pretty hand wavey, any other suggestions as how to make them more powerful would be welcome.

  Ice and Steam suffer the same problem - they are fortress powers (both ice powers decrease mobility, steam needs a local heat source for most of their abilities). Water have insane mobility and incredible attacking powers. 

  Water Conduits seem overpowered for siege scale attacks. Consider the amount of water you could drop on your enemy by spinning in a circle (2 people, spinning at 3g in a 600m diameter circle gives about 60mm per 5 minutes of rainfall, which is over world record rainfall level... remember, from 2 Conduits). They could fly vertically up and down (well, near vertically assuming they can go faster than terminal velocity) hammering a column of water onto the unfortunates underneath. If it does look a bit dodgy, away they go and the Ice and Steam people can't follow (Ice at all, Steam for long).

  On the world-building front, the major travel routes between Water cities are going to be cut quickly into grand canyon style landscapes by erosion from the high-powered water jets passing regularly overhead (assuming there is any regular travel, you could avoid it with an intensely feudal structure). If the nobles have any sense, irrigation wouldn't be a problem so they could spread over most terrain, encroaching on the tropics quickly. With enhanced senses, mining becomes much less about guesswork, so there would be no shortage of materiel for the expansion. They're going to cover the world very quickly.

    Do you think the water people don't get dizzy? I don't believe that spinning in a circle very fast is going to be very good for a person. Of course, in your scenario, an Ice type user could just stasis him/herself until the water person collapses. Thoughts? 

    And the Ice type fortresses would be difficult to break due to their invincible walls of stasis'd old people. If the political situation(nations) are similar to the Avatar-verse, any invaders would be pretty much incapable of getting inside.

  I personally dislike how much it feels like every aspect comes down to word-of-author. The way people receive powers comes down to what feels like a mind projection fallacy , because the difference between all of these is like 100 kelvin, while for the previous 250 kelvin there weren't any distinctions, you know? Water's just water.

  What's the diplomatic relations between them like? Are conduits free to travel anywhere they like?

  Some questions to flesh things out:

  **General**

  Is there an in-world reason for the thematic nature of their magic system? There are a lot of "why?" questions that'd be most easily answered by 'water god said so when he made the system.' Why only 1 type of conduit power per person? Why segregated by geography? Just how much exposure is required to activate a conduit?

  **Ice**

  >>make parts or all of you utterly invincible, but also immovable.

  Wouldn't the immovable clause preclude punching? If it's immobility with respect to some frame of reference (the ground, probably) then alternatively freezing the bottom of your feet would be  a valid method of walking through the air. 

  If old folk can be used for a wall, I guess than means the length of the stasis is chosen upon activation and the ice cost is 'paid' then as well. Can you change the duration actively? How selective can you be with the process? Can I perma-stasis the skin of my forearm and shin and retain full mobility with nigh infinite blocking power? Getting a super-speed punch blocked by an utterly unyielding forearm would hurt.

  Iceputers seem interesting. I'm sure the 'cannot change the temp of an iceputer' clause could be manipulated for tech applications. (super efficient heat sink) It also seems like it may have some crazy synergy with non-ice conduits' abilities. Make a 'container' out of ice, store 'I had toast this morning' and now a steam user has complete immunity to heat/fire while holding it.

  An active piece of memory ice seems to be only affected by its creator 'going in.' Can others ever view the stored memory? What if I try to stasis using an active iceputer? When the owner of an active piece of memorice dies, does it persist? If I have an absurd capacity for learning, could I make an ice memory (huge, my entire knowledge of math) then relearn the concept and keep the permanent ice around? Old folk doing the noble sacrifice of 10000 year stasis could probably get a little more yield by more or less wiping their own minds beforehand. Make an entire perma-cool ice palace and turn into a (frozen) vegetable!

  **Water**

  Water seems outright broken to me. Once you hit 25 mph, you've got super mobility that comes with the ability to shoot cutting jets. If this is a no-firearms type of world, that's nigh unstoppable. Add in the fact that being inundated by an overhead water conduit would really mess up the capabilities of both ice and steam conduits by way of melting/cooling their respective 'fuels.'

  'Water sense' consumes water, but someone actively leaving a water trail could just freeze some of that infinite source for arbitrarily strong perception, or make enormous blocks of ice rain down from miles up. Even if water is consumed, rather than frozen, this would be 'always on' for an actively mobile water conduit.

  **Steam**

  What defines/bounds the idea of a container? If I make a stainless steel sphere 1/2 full of water, then redirect heat into it, I've got the best-case scenario for a fuel tank, but it still seems somewhat limited.

  How hot does something need to be to serve as a heat source to a steam user? The cutoff there could make or break its applications. That said, in a fantasy-level world's tech, being able to manipulate molten metal by hand would have interesting outcomes...

  ```

- u/IX-103:
  ```
  How long does it take for a ice conduit user to apply personal stasis? If it can be triggered instantly, then you have the perfect shield for any attack that you can predict. 

  How fast can you enter and leave your iceputer?  If you can go in and out of your ice mind palace at a high rate, you could spend a minute or so to completely process what you heard/saw/felt/smelled in each 1/10th of a second. This would effectively give you the increased thinking speed of the steam users without the drawbacks.

  Do iceputers act as perfect heat insulators (do not conduct heat), or do they just have an infinite specific heat (tend force the environment to match their temperature)? 
  If they force the environment to match their temperature, then they are severely overpowered since 1) they could suck the heat right out of steam users before it could be used, 2) they could prevent a water user from using any of their powers by freezing the water-shadow to their skin as it is generated.
  If they are perfect heat insulators, then they would obviously have a lot of industrial uses. Aside from making metallurgy much more efficient, they could be used to create engines that are 100% thermodynamically efficient. Heck, with something like that, it may even be possible to create usable fusion power (put water in an almost perfectly sealed iceputer container, add energy until you are getting more energy out than you put in).

  Can iceputers be altered mechanically -- can they be cut/carved/drilled/shattered with appropriate tools and force? If so, what what would the appropriate tools/force be? What happens with the pieces of the original iceputer that result -- do I end up with a bunch of smaller iceputers (each with a fragment of the memory), or do I end up with regular ice fragments and the memory is destroyed? 

  If they are can't be altered mechanically, they would be unbreakable and would be the perfect material for armor and weapons. Even if they break to smaller iceputers, they could be used to fashion armor practically impermeable to heat (Your heat can't get through my bag of iceputer dust armor!).

    Man, this is why I love /r/rational.  Triggering stasis for the whole body can happen as fast as "oh shit", but triggering it for specific places takes more time and mental effort, probably about up to a half second with enough training and practice.  Entering and leaving can happen instantaneously, but it does use up the ice.  And I think I'm going to change it, based on some other comments about infinite loops of memories, so that you can't remember what you exactly did in the iceputer, but you do keep conclusions as gut feelings and instincts.  For example, you're in a forest, examining some mushrooms, unsure if you should eat them,  so you go into your iceputer where you've stored memories of learning about poisonous fungi.  You study it for a bit, and then come back out, not remembering the studying, but still having the gut feeling that eating the one with red dots is a really bad idea. 

    I was planning on perfect insulators, since that would give the ice people an easy way to power their technology. Or maybe it'd be better to simply have them as really, really efficient insulators, like 99%. That way, they would melt eventually, just really, really slowly, and could still be used to make efficient engines for their airships, without breaking the laws of physics. Airships fueled by the consumption of memories sounds fun.   I think with the level of technology they have, around 1800's-ish, insanely efficient engines won't be too broken? 

    Iceputers can be broken just like normal ice, and once broken they turn back into ice. (However, you need normal ice for stasis...) No suits of ice armor, though the armor of insulating ice is possible, if you want to to spend the time to put enough memories into enough small pieces of ice, that will melt eventually.

  What's the tech like in this universe? Do the steam people have anything more complex than stone tools? Do the water people have steel yet? How far ahead are the ice people?

  Also, does ice stasis apply to clothes/held objects as well the people using it? and are there powers for the other two states of matter?

  ~~Lastly, a suggested nerf for the water people; the water shadow doesn't draw from an infinite supply of water, but rather from a finite store that can be replenished by the users~~

  EDIT: What are the restriction on what can/can't be absorbed? Assuming low tech level for the water people, any water will contain impurities. It it just limited to salt? 

  How insular is ice society? to the others have any access to their tech? How likely is it for different phase users to work together? Is there a lower limit on steam-heat taking? 

  Electric dynamos were invented during the 1800's so what an ice user could do is have an iceputer encased steam-powered (heat provided by a steam user) source of electricity. This is something of a trump against the water people.

  "Parts of yourself" mean you can still create impossibly sharp blades. Stasis a single cell thick layer of your epidermis, or a single hair if dead parts of your body are allowed, and you still get an impossibly sharp blade. You could create thousands of 30μm-thin needles by Stasising alternating rows of skin cells.

  As a more macabre option, dying people could turn their bodies into 3D printers, Stasising sections of body parts with arbitrary shapes. Morbid obesity would help with the size limits, and of course the head can be preserved so it's not a costly sacrifice in a Utilitarian sense.

  >If you stasis all of yourself, you will become immovable by anything, even gravity, but you won’t be able to see what’s happening.

  "Immovable by gravity": unconstrained by the clutches of the sun, earth, galaxy, or supercluster components, you immediately fly off into space at thousands of kilometers per second.

  This needs clarification.

  >so for many generation, when someone is about to die, they instead are taken to the wall, and stasis themselves for ten thousand years or so,

  This is going to be awkward in ten thousand years when the first octogenarians thaw and are immediately crushed to death by later generations.

  >making it incapable of changing temperature

  You wot m8. This is either superconductivity, a perfect insulator, or a cheap source of energy. If it perfectly reflects all heat at the point where it receives it, use it as perfect insulation: furnaces, clothes, etc. If it perfectly reflects all heat it receives, evenly distributed over its surface, coat a thin, very long memory shard with insulating materials (easy to create with ridiculously sharp human skin-knives in the form of a grating), heat it at one end to cause heating at the other end, allowing for long-distance communications. If it always feels the same temperature regardless of heat sources, place it in an environment with a different temperature (e.g. outside) and harvest energy from the heat exchange. Export it to the tropics for refrigeration.

  Also: these memory shards add with the Stasis cannons to make perfect pneumatic cannons. Place 1 L of memory ice in the back end of a Stasis barrel, which has one tiny hole in the back. Have someone stand against the back of the Stasis barrel, touching the memory ice through the hole. Have them Stasis their body, except for a cubic micrometer around the hole and whatever else is necessary to be safe. Have them enter the memory ice, and wait there until the memory ice will completely sublimate upon leaving. Then, have them leave. 1000L of sublimated steam propels the projectile forward, having nowhere else to go because it is completely surrounded by infinitely strong materials.
