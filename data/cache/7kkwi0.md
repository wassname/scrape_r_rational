  Just read through from the beginning; you had me at the 'literally inside the Internet' lie.

  What he's trying to maintain regarding his local city is *terrifying*.  (Social life, job, suspicious equipment.)

  I find myself quite curious about how he originally got in touch with (and received equipment from) Doc.  Also whether Doc's equipment is able to effectively confound people (capes or otherwise) who try to trace Delphic's communications.

  Taking another moment to contemplate how terrifying his lifestyle is:  'I could live in a luxurious isolated location with zero human contact, splitting my time between recreation and changing the world for goodness and profit.  Instead I will now go do my job, which involves frequently climbing in locations which would be dangerous if I were to slip or were a foothold to break.  I do my job as a cover for planting suspicious equipment in various places.  I've set up a balancing act that requires me to do all maintenance associated with these locations, and if I'm unable to do this for a few days my suspicious equipment will be discovered.  For the sake of this job, I will now head into a neighbourhood which will surely respond to my presence with fear, violence, and/or calling down upon my individuals who have a good chance of using violence against me.  I do this frequently, though all this about my lifestyle is optional, and (as far as the reader is aware) I have no personal-protection powers to safeguard my body.'  AHHHHH.  (Terrifying.)

  Delphic is a superhero story about Hector, a young man in Detroit with the ability to see the past and the present. It follows his attempts to leverage this unusual ability to do good in the world while remaining behind the scenes, keeping both his identity and the truth of his powers secret from those who would see him as a threat.

  Story threads will focus on several characters as Hector encounters them:

  * Hector's sister, Paris, a homicide detective hiding her own power,
  * Doc Stevens, a disgraced scientist at the forefront of research on the source of super powers, and
  * The exploits of various "Super Teams": government-run groups of supers whose scope of operations have been steadily growing.
