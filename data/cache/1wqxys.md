## Go, /r/rational, be free...

### Post:

Having a bit of a staffing change. I've been mod of /r/rational for about 5 months, and successfully repurposed it to the point that it's now an active subreddit. So my job is done, and I'm passing the torch down to /u/eaturbrainz. Besides, [I've been meaning to quit reddit for some time now](http://www.reddit.com/r/howtoquitreddit/comments/1srtz9/made_a_step_in_the_right_direction/) and, now I've cut myself from responsibility, what better time than now?

So yeah, that's what's happened. Carry on.

  So anyway, I'm your new overlord.  The Spice must flow.  Get to work.

  Goodbye /u/seraphnb. You did well. I'll miss you insightful comments.

  And I don't mean to suck up to the leadership, but I truly think /u/eaturbrainz is a good choice for your replacement.

        And yes, my username *is* a deliberate Coulton reference.
