  Man, I don't think the guess about Dead King's inability to leave Keter is remotely on the money.  I think Cat and co. have something to trade, but it isn't at all what they think.
  ```

    This.  
    I think he can leave any time he wants, but to do so not only puts a target on his head but also can be perceived as Evil "tipping the scales".  He doesn't want to give Good the go-ahead to pull out a proportionate response, as large-scale warfare between the two forces him into a well-known story.

    He stays because his slow, patient approach gets him what he wants.

    I wonder... can she grant Titles to the Undead?  Invest some of her Winter authority in the Revenants, perhaps?  At a cost to her, the Dead King can even the scales. 12 heroes but 6 (ish) villains?(ish)   Let's add some Knighted Revenants to the latter side and make this a 'fair' fight.

      Weird things were happening with her undead in Book 3, so there’s probably something exploitable

  I like that just a few paragraphs after Cat's ability to create a new court is discussed, she's announced not as the Duchess of Moonless Nights but as the Sovereign. That atleast implies Akua was heading in the right direction with her speculation
  ```

  - u/haiku_fornification:

    There's definitely something to this. 

    As far as I recall, Larat has been referring to Cat as queen since she's been crowned. It's either Queen of the Hunt or Queen of Winter. It makes me think all Cat's doing at this point is denying or ignoring her true nature and it might bite her in the ass later.

  Oh dear, muted alarm bells ringing in my head.

  Dead King is somehow *still* very paranoid about his visitors. I would've thought he might have made a statement about their inability to hurt him by being physically present, but he chose not to. Is he really vulnerable then? Or is it simply a leftover paranoia from when he was human?
  ```

  - u/Saintsant:
    ```
    I think extreme risk-aversion is part and parcel of his philosophy. Declarations of invulnerability, no matter how justified, run the risk of creating a narrative that culminates in their undoing. Why give them a chance to examine his personal defenses when he can negotiate perfectly well without doing that, especially since Hierophant's entire deal is analyzing and recreating miraculous magics? He's the Dead King, he doesn't need the marginal bump to intimidation. The man intends to live forever, and even very small risks add up over time. Giving no openings is consistent with his style.
    ```

    - u/cyberdsaiyan:
      ```
      Ah, that explains it quite well.
      ```

        Always remember the LAST words of that Dread Emperor who has the epithet "The erroneous"

    I felt this way at first too, but reading it over again it actually doesn't seem that worrisome. In the last chapter, Akua (in fae form) was referred to as "one of the Splendid." The Dead King obviously isn't some chump to be fooled by her appearance, and so recognized her for what she is: a shade (as she is dead) of Splendour (as she is infused with Winter). It IS interesting that there's nary a mention of her Name, though. I'd have expected The Dead King to at least call that out too. Possibly he doesn't know, or maybe it hints that she's moving from Diabolist to a new Name, potentially the redemption arc theory people are batting around?
    ```

    - u/TideofKhatanga:
      ```
      That or the whole dying, being turned onto a cloak and having her aspects Taken by Cat put a hard stop to Akua having a Name.
      ```

      - u/CeruleanTresses:
        ```
        I think the narration does still sometimes refer to her as Diabolist, though.
        ```

  - u/serge_cell:
    ```
    May be he is not vulnerable to Cat as she is, but to Cat as she could potentially could be. Like Cat undergoing instant explosive redemption right inside his hall. Due to reverse causality precautions could prevent those type of narrative traps.
    ```

- u/over_who:
  ```
  The talk of titles paints Cat's comment to Pilgrim about throwing resurrections around like solstice treats in a different light
  ```

  - u/TideofKhatanga:
    ```
    I'm not sure it changes the context that much but that was Akua's comment, not Cat's.
    ```

    - u/Zayits:
      ```
      It does change the context, since I'm pretty sure Pilgrim knew who he was talking to. Consider their exchange in [interlude Kaleidoscope VI](https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2018/06/04/kaleidoscope-vi/):

      > “Child,” he said, tone appalled.  “What have you done to yourself?”

      > “What needed to be done,” the Black Queen calmly replied. “My side doesn’t get to walk away clean, Pilgrim. I see you’ve been tossing around resurrections like they’re godsdamned solstice treats, too. Charming. Not going to have any long-term ramifications at all.”

      > The monster paused, then leaned forward.

      > “Did that register as a lie?” she grinned. “It didn’t, did it? Have a good think about that one next time you try to sleep, Pilgrim.”

      > “Surrender,” the Great Elder said. “Abdicate. It is not too late.”

      > “You missing the part where I’m currently winning the battle?” the Black Queen drawled. “Hells, it’s not too late for you either. Terms were offered and they hold. Take your army and go home. This doesn’t need to turn into a Named pissing contest.”

      > “You would argue this, after slaying thousands?” the Pilgrim asked.

      > “I feel like we might need to revisit the concept of foreign invasion,” the villain noted. “Specifically the part where it has fucking consequences. Like, you know, people dying. You’d think that one would be a given, but apparently you’re slow learners. Wahwah, my attempt to conquer a – sort of – sovereign nation wasn’t met with flowers and a godsdamned parade. It’s almost like we’re not happy about the whole thing. Go figure.”

      > “And you think your reign a better alternative?” the Grey Pilgrim asked calmly.

      > “Hells, Pilgrim, I was born to rule,” the Black Queen replied with a toothy grin. “But I’ll settle for getting you fucks out of my backyard, this once. Any takers?”

      > The monster’s gaze swept across the crowd of Bestowed as she idly emptied her pipe and put it away within her cloak. The only answer was Light blooming and weapons raised.

      > “Ah, well,” the Black Queen mused. “Pissing contest it is, then.”

      Catherine's body isn't looking any different from usual, here, so the Pilgrim must be looking at the soul. There's a chance that he meant that Catherine's transformation when so deep into Winter is troubling, but he's already shown he can ignore this if necessary. In contrast, Akua's soul being long extracted, bound to a cloak's collar and then shoved into Catherine's body is definitely something that would catch his attention.

      Akua's response may be interpreted both as telling the Pilgrim that him putting his hand to the scales was a narrative invitation for her to get "resurrected" as well, and as offer for him to think about actually resurrecting her at a later date.

      Tariq replies with pretty much the same conditions that were constantly offered to Catherine, confirming to the Diabolist that a redemption into a Good name is still an option, and gets the same kind of retort. 

      I'd like to point out (again) that the phrasing “You would argue this, after slaying thousands?” implies that casualties inflicted by Catherine personally are significantly larger than the ones inflicted by the armies, which isn't true. However, if he's addressing Akua, then this turns into a reminder that he can't simply leave alone a mass-murderer who killed more people than the both present armies combined. When hearing an extended (and roundabout) explanation of why she considers herself already having suffered consequences of her failed conquest, he responds with understandably sceptical “And you think your reign a better alternative?”

      Then Akua straight up says she was born to rule Hells. I know she kicks ass in this chapter, but I can't wrap my head around *everybody in the comment section missing it*. At best some people remarked that this phrase is out of character for Catherine. But after Akua realizes he wouldn't budge on the subject, draws the line of what she considers her due and effectively closes the negotiation, she doesn't harm heroes that much either! Her section of the interlude starts with her musing about playing a hero herself, and then she proceeds to throw around attacks an average hero would easily shrug off. The only serious attacks are on people who have a healer on hand (Silent Guardia, Forsworn Healer) or heavy hitters (Saint of Swords).

      In that context, refusing to help with the negotiations Catherine was raising the pressure that made her either fold (in which case the redemption is applied straightforwardly, since she now has to fight everyone that previously backed her to “amend her sins”), or resort to the drastic measures he no doubt saw her considering, which gives the next batch of heroes narrative advantage and makes her let Akua out more frequently, who either backstabs her (which brings us back to Evil turns on Evil) or behaves like a decent person until she has a chance to contact the Pilgrim again (which, aside from story of an artifact backfiring on its owner, would allow him more control over her “character development”, or at least trick the villains to their doom).

      Either way, the consequences of Below's interference are mitigated by the fact that the people it props up are divided and fighting amongst themselves. Playing the narrative, as far as the balance is concerned, isn't a big enough addition of power by itself, so he has all the chances to sic the emerging threats on each other (at least from his own point of view).
      ```

- u/Agnoman:
  ```
  I'm glad to see them finally reach the Dead King, and I'm looking forward to seeing how this all plays out, but I'm still really unconvinced by this whole plan. Cat talks about how she thinks this is safe because of two reasons, the heroes and her leverage. I'm not sure either can really be relied upon.

  For the latter we have the doubt that Akua is raising, and for the former we've seen how the heroes in the Crusade went. They barely managed to match up to the Woe. Cat proved she was a match for ten junior heroes at once, and Archer held up against the Saint (who couldn't kill Nauk when given a chance). I mean, the heroes in total only managed a stalemate against Callow when they had double the number of soldiers *and* both Cat and Masego were out of it for three days.

  What are they going to do against the Dead King?
  ```

  - u/OmniscientQ:
    ```
    The heroes invading Callow via the Stairway were matched by the Woe because it makes for a much better story. The close calls, the struggle of nearly-matched opponents, etc. And Catherine was doing her best to frame the narrative of that battle as a hostile, invading army rather than the heroic liberators freeing Callow from the yoke of Evil.

    The heroes are still very much leverage against the Dead King, especially if the Dead King attempts to cross the Proceran border. The "junior heroes", as you call them, will lose their incompetence overnight. They'll do some soul-searching, both literal and figurative. And then they'll declare in one voice, "Let's get dangerous!"

    EDIT: In fact, their defeat at the hands of the Woe makes the Let's Get Dangerous trope even more effective. The entire Battle of Two Camps may have occured simply as the narrative prerequisite for powering up against the Dead King.
    ```

- u/None:
  ```
  I'm as stoked as anyone else about the possibility of titles being back on the table but, I'm wondering if cat can just pull out like the elves and move callow itself to Arcadia chill for a while, and with her army rebuild and well rested just come back like "SURPRISE MOTHERFUCKER"
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    I would suspect that the citizens would suffer some long term effects from living in Arcadia
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      yeah getting stuck in Cycles becoming more fae than human, sounds better than getting killed in a crusade
      ```

- u/Solaire145:
  ```
  If I had a time machine, I think the only thing I could reasonably use it for is to go far enough into the future to finish this and all the other incomplete stories I have started.
  ```

  - u/OmniscientQ:
    ```
    This right here is how one maximizes utility.
