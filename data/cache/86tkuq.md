## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  The main character of my serial can convert heat into kinetic energy and vice versa, and is able to store a lot of heat inside of himself (he's gotten up to 3k degrees Celsius). 

  In reality his power is actually absorbing vibrational energy of all kinds but for his current level of understanding he absorbs Heat and Kinetic, and can change them into each other. 

  What are some cool tricks he could pull as he figures his power out down the line?

    **Flight**: Not just any flight, but almost perfect flight. No need to turn gradually. No need to accelerate gradually. No need to worry about momentum. Assuming he can convert kinetic to heat and back very quickly, he can do all kinds of crazy stunts like instantly stopping, instantly changing directions, and staying perfectly still without any need to generate lift.

    **Superspeed**: Just apply your flight ability while staying on the ground.

    **Physical and Temperature Invulnerability**: Any kind of attack that deals damage using physical force, heat, or cold can be nullified just by converting its energy away. The only limiting factor is how fast your MC can convert one energy type into another. The amount of energy he can store isn't much of an issue since he can funnel the excess energy into firing stuff away from him at super speeds.

    **Ridiculously Maneuverable Vehicles**: One reason we don't have super fast vehicles is the squishiness of the driver. If the vehicle accelerates or turns too fast, the driver will be crushed by the forces exerted on the human body to change its speed and direction. The reason this kills the driver is that the particles that make up his body will have different amounts of kinetic energy, causing them to squish together or tear apart. Your MC will have no such issues if he can distribute the kinetic energy equally to every part of his body (he can't just convert it all to heat, or he blast out of the vehicle). Then again, your MC probably doesn't need the vehicle other than as a nice way to carry things with him.

    **Super-strength**: Sort of? You can give objects kinetic energy to make them move upwards or throw them really hard. You can absorb their downwards kinetic energy to make them float in midair. It isn't quite the same as having super-strength, but you will be able to act as if you do have super-strength.

    **WARNING: Gory uses below.** 

    [Limited Shapeshifting:](#s " Your MC can't convert one chemical to another or create mass out of nothing, but he can probably survive doing things like opening holes in his body or cutting up his flesh to make long ropes. I mean, one reason why having holes in your body is usually bad is because vital stuff inside you falls out, and poisonous stuff outside you gets in. The MC can use his kinetic energy powers to nullify that problem, creating an immovable wall of air over his openings that prevents anything from falling out or getting into his body. Though he can't go too far like splitting his body in two, since he wouldn't be able to get blood from one side to the other. Still, this means he can do stuff like throwing his intestines or blood vessels outside his body and using them as lassos. Which could turn out useful if he finds himself trapped in a place with only materials that are immune to his supernatural abilities.")

    [Mass shedding:](#s " If your MC is desperate, there are many parts of his body that he can permanently discard. An example situation where this might be useful is if he needs to hide from a really dangerous enemy, and wants to make himself as small as possible. In that case, he can use his limited shapeshifting to throw out almost every bone in his body, since he doesn't need them to support his body structure when he can just apply the right amounts of kinetic energy to do the same thing. He needs some to keep producing blood cells though. He doesn't need legs to run since he can just apply kinetic force on himself to move. He doesn't need arms to manipulate things when he can do the same with his supernatural ability. He doesn't need a heart to pump blood when he can just pump it with his ability. He doesn't need ears to detect sounds, which are vibrations that he can probably sense using his supernatural ability. By getting rid of all these unnecessary parts, he can probably shrink himself down to less than a quarter of his size, making it much easier to hide or fit in tiny containers/tunnels.")

      Thanks for your awesome breakdown. Some of these I've planned and considered, outside of the car idea (he's still figuring things out right now: he's learning the physical and temperature invulnerability, some super speed, loves to launch himself around but hasn't quite figured out flight yet, and uses the "sort-of" super strength as his main go-to), but the super crazy body horror ones I had NO FUCKING CLUE WOW WHAT THE FUCK.
      ```

      - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
        ```
        The irony is that the body horror ones were inspired by a children's show: Danny phantom, using that power [here.](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/dpwikia/images/e/e0/S01e18_Danny_Phantom_body_ring.png/revision/latest?cb=20160627031636)

      If his fine control is good enough he should be able to survive without  breathing for some fairly absurd periods of time (eventually he would need oxygen for collagen production type of time scales) by selectively exciting atoms sufficient to break their bonds and positioning them via vibration/motion in such a way that they fall into a shape that supports the chemical chain he wants.

      Given sufficient finesse and scope of awareness he should be able to do transmutation of materials short of actually making atoms. Although if you consider 'temperature' to be a vibration it should also be possible for him to also instigate fission and fusion reactions by 'shaking' neutrons and atomic nuculi into each other.

      What I'm saying is that with enough control he should be able to make a sun happen.
      ```

      - u/Nighzmarquls:
        ```
        If his 'vibration' power extends all the way to light, then he could potentially make a black hole. Or maybe even gravity waves. But this is getting into some conceptual stuff of what is vibration.
        ```

        - u/MegajouleWrites:
          ```
          So, the basic conceit is he's a clone of a superhero who had total energy conversion/absorption/immunity, but only ended up with the vibrational energy conversion (So heat, force, etc) but didn't get electromagnetic energy at all. He can't manipulate gravitational forces (though the actual kinetic energy of falling he can use) or electricity. 

          I've limited how fine his control over his power is by his book smarts: he doesn't understand enough fundamental physics to make full use of a lot of his powers (Yet!) but the more he learns, the finer his control gets. He can't fly yet because it hasn't clicked that he could just constantly reconvert the kinetic energy of falling into energy that would propel him in flight.

    I would like to comment that it's not heat itself per se that provides work, but rather temperature differences. For example, if there was magic that could instantly cool an area down, then it would be able to power a steam engine just as well as a magic that could heat up an area. It's just that it's normally a lot easier/faster to heat up something than cooling it down. I got the idea from a comment someone mentioned on the r/rational discord.
    ```

    Any small object that he holds can become a deadly bullet.

    Any object that hits him, including bullets, can be easily stopped (I'm guessing he has to see it coming for this).

    He can throw practically anything around.
    ```

  - u/Kilbourne:
    ```
    If he wears a water-tank, that will increase his absorption; he can quick-cycle energy kinetic-thermal-kinetic to control greater amounts of energy.
    ```

  - u/Trips-Over-Tail:
    ```
    What's the range of his ability?
    ```

  - u/lordcirth:
    ```
    Do you mean that his body temperature reaches 3k Celsius without causing him harm?  That's a neat trick.  It would make you deadly in hand-to-hand combat, as anyone who touches you gets burned alive.  However it could also set the room on fire.

    With the ability to absorb kinetic energy (on touch?) you can block any weapon, then release the energy to send it springing back into it's owner.  However this violates conservation of momentum.
    ```

  You are in an iron-age society.  What is the most awesome, and actually useful (they aren't dumb) thing that you can create in a few days using any modern knowledge, but iron-age materials and tools?
  ```

  - u/Kilbourne:
    ```
    Me, personally? In a few days?

    Hmm. Some detailed drawings of useful things other people could make. A treatise of basic germ and genetic theory. Gravitational theory. Badly understood astronomy and calculus. Basically just an info-dump of things I think would/could be useful for people to tech-jump themselves if in the right hands, ie. a talented, literate alchemist-blacksmith.

    I could *make* some miniature models of things, like plows, waterwheels and waterscrews, keeled boats and tallships, leaf-spring suspension for carts and wagons; other 'basic' machines.

    I have no practical chemical knowledge.

    I have enough practical medical knowledge that I suppose I could become a competent and successful surgeon, especially what with washing my hands all the time.

    I could 'invent' crop rotation, depending on the region.
    ```

    - u/MegajouleWrites:
      ```
      I think just the washing your hands thing would set you heads and shoulders above a lot of medical professionals of the past.
      ```

  - u/Frommerman:
    ```
    Given scrap metal and help from a blacksmith, I could create a prototype for a [mouldboard plow](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plough). The real innovations were in having the sharp blade to cut the ground and the wide, curved wings to physically turn the dirt over, exposing dirt that isn't as nutrient starved and aerating the land. We only developed them in the 13-1400s in our world despite it being technically possible to do so far earlier. They're credited with the massive European population spike beginning in the Renaissance which necessitated colonialism just to have a place to dump all the extra people.
    ```

  - u/Nighzmarquls:
    ```
    if it's our universe?
    No language barrier?

    I could probably build a movable type printing press.

    I think I'd also be able to make a quest list for the various experimental results and craftspeople needed to get the industrial revolution started.

    I'm pretty confident on that kind of thing but I also know what I don't know. There would be lots of gaps.
    ```

    - u/1337_w0n:
      ```
      I think this one wins.

      If it were me, I'd add a good chunk of modern mathematics, since that happens to be my trade, to what I print out.
      ```

  - u/Frommerman:
    ```
    I've gotten a better one, even. It's pretty easy to replicate Pasteur's experiments disproving spontaneous generation with iron-age tech if you know to do so in the first place. Making usable glassware for it might be difficult, but making metalware would be easier. Also, if I'm near the coast and citrus fruits, I can make agar from seaweed and show them Penicillium a millennium early. They won't be able to isolate the stuff for a while, but knowing is more than half the battle on that one.
    ```

  - u/1337_w0n:

    Crucible steel is really nice, if you know how to make it. And not too *terribly* difficult to make if you can already work iron. After that, I would use my prestige from making the strongest metal anyone has ever used to do what a couple others suggested institute a written language and/or create a printing press. This of course is followed by using that to spread modern ideas including, but not limited to:

    Basics of Germ Theory and medicine.
    The basics of Evolution, biology, neurology and psychology. 
    A large portion of Mathematics and physics, including rudimentary electrical technology. 
    A little bit of agricultural science and steam engine mechanics.
    Cosmology, ethics, and philosophy. 

    Maybe I'll just make a new religion and use my superior metallurgy, science, tactics, and technology to take over the world. Who knows, maybe if I have help I can get the singularity going before I die. I'll need to reinvent computer science from scratch, since I have no personal knowledge of the field other than basic IT stuff, but with the entire population, maybe I'll find someone brilliant enough to get it going with my guidance and a story about Charles Babage.

      There is a lot of stuff you have to know in order to get the sort of runaway computation that modern computers give us.

      You need to know atoms and a proper theory of electromagnetism.
      ```

  - u/CopperZirconium:
    ```
    I, personally, could make an early wet-cell battery. I could probably make an electric motor and a generator from scratch too. Zinc, copper, iron, vinegar, brine; that's basically the raw materials for level 0 on the electronics tech tree.

    I think I could make a steam engine too.

    From there I would do my best to go full Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court.

    ```
    A hydraulic system,  depending on the date i am  sure  there are water mills however there could be several industries that could be  automated or close to  it your have the proper knowledge  am sure limited electrical capability could be reached in time you could be rich and influential in no time
