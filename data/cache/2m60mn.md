  Can we please talk about how easily this could have backfired on Quirrel?

    Quirrel could have checked that Harry survived using a timeturner.

  I don't really understand how a mob could come to the forest this fast. The military could detect the wards but I don't see how a mob could have access to that information.

    Yeah, and gun control in England is pretty much *yes*. To the point that most *police officers* do not carry sidearms.

    I am not seeing how a group of 'skinheads' have that much heavy ordnance, and connection to sources of military information, and happened to just by chance be going by the forest where the students were. And just happen to kill two people very important to both of the main heroes.

    Unless we assume Quirrel did it, but it's becoming a bit much at this point, that excuse.

    I cannot see Quirrel doing all of this. For one, in canon he very clearly *does not want* the Muggles to use nuclear weapons ever, and the level of paranoia and fear at this point would almost necessitate it. 

    Also, as the top comment here indicates, this seems like a great way to accidentally get Harry killed. 

    Significantly more than 2 things had to go right for this plan, is what I'm saying.

      Yes, good point too about the gun control law. 
      I've really enjoyed this fanfic but the more I think of it, the more I feel that this chapter needs some tweaking and editing to bring it to the level of the rest.

      The mob/group of skinheads come out of nowhere and there's no explanation for them to be there or to have this amount of weapon. Even if  Quirrel  influenced them to come there, it seems unlikely he would have access to Muggle weapons to equip them. It's also very risky and seems out of character for him. Too many things could go wrong for this to be his plan.

  On a related note, I think the Author is forgetting that this fic operates on Harry Potter time, in 1991.

  In 1991, computer technology was *significantly* (on the order of [several thousand times](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/Transistor_Count_and_Moore%27s_Law_-_2011.svg/667px-Transistor_Count_and_Moore%27s_Law_-_2011.svg.png)) less powerful than modern hardware.

  So the computers involved are running on 20 megs of hot ram, and use 5 1/2 inch floppies for storage.

  People do not carry ubiqutous cell-phone cameras, the average camcorder is shoulder mounted and records on a VHS tape. 

  No modern drone-carriers and instant facial recognition software.

  No nation at that time had the ability to instantly check through satellite imaging to find a ~1 acre square in Scotland which showed up on a computer map as blank terrain but showed to human eyes as normal. I'm not even sure that the resolution and software is good enough to do that in **under a week** *today*.

  In short, this whole chapter just torched my suspension of disbelief.

    As a small factoid supporting this, GPS wasn't fully operational (24 satellites in orbit) till 1993, and wasn't complete til 1995 (when they had the specified 3 spares). And even then the accuracy was significantly reduced for everyone but the US military till 2000 when they turned off the encryption.

    Google, the company, didn't exist till 1997 and didn't introduce google maps till 2005, even if we let the military have a 10 year head start on digital maps/satellite images they're still 4 years too late.

    The only way I can see this making sense is if Quirell is behind it and as others have pointed out it is a huge risk. If he is worried about nuclear war, mind controlling the military into missile attacks is probably not a good idea. Risk to Harry may be mitigated by time travel, full military control would likely take more than 6hrs.

    I can assure you, the author is entirely aware of the time period (even if she missed certain unfortunate details about the GPS program).

    > So the computers involved are running on 20 megs of hot ram, and use 5 1/2 inch floppies for storage.

    You are assuming that the military uses the kind of average PC that's sold in a shop, which is quite an assumption. :P

    > No modern drone-carriers and instant facial recognition software.

    The word "drone" was badly chosen, and obviously facial recognition isn't used here. This is just meant as a missile or somewhat like that.

    > People do not carry ubiqutous cell-phone cameras

    There is no part assuming they do. I guess this refers to some tiny fraction of the billions of people on earth managing to videotape the events? Given the situation, I'd imagine that there would be plenty - my family certainly had a handheld camera at the time, and there were security cameras in shops.

    > I'm not even sure that the resolution and software is good enough to do that in under a week today.

    Whyever not? Depending on the map format and exactly how "blank" looks to the computer, and assuming there exists a programmer experienced with running terrain scans on it, I'm fairly sure it wouldn't take much more than an hour to wite the C-code, even if it must be fast enough to work perfectly well on the computers at the time.

    The question is, of course, how they knew what to look for in the first place, but I imagine the military has been aware of anomalies in their satellite data for a while - if there's mysterious places where the terrain doesn't look the same to the human eye as to the computer, they're probably going to notice that such places exist in Russia first, and either assume that someone tampered with the satellite data or that there is strange technology going on.

    I do realize that many things, like GPS, were restricted to the US military at the time, but I made the assumption that they shared it with their allies in the cold war., especially the ones who held nukes and might be called upon in an instant to join them in an attack.

  This has escalated quickly and left me feeling down. As per previous comments I also feel that this wasn't realistic within the timeline and story as told so far.

  Oh dear.

  This is... not good.

  In fact I think this is shaping up to be a significantly darker final arc than HPMOR, though it might be a while before we know for sure.

  Why don't they just disillusion themselves?

  Seems way smarter than doing the whole area protection thing, speaking of which, since when could you know that you'd been moved or turned around by that?

  Why was there a military brigade moving through that forest anyway, and why aren't they capturing wizards to interrogate, they're clearly on the downside of information warfare, couldn't they see that if Cornelius could do that then shouldn't they assume anyone can teleport into the middle of Parliament and kill them all? Unless they can trace wizards attacking is pretty pointless.

  Okay, so you're a violent mob which has little-to-no understanding how magic works, and you want to kill some wizards. Any wizards, you aren't in the mood to be specific.

  Do you target:

  A. Magically warded undetectable wizard schools in the countryside.

  *or*

  B. The local occult curios store (which you have no idea that it is actually run by clueless muggles), which you've always suspected to have politically questionable clientele.

  We have to remember that if the HPMORverse even moderately resembles our own, for every real wizard out there, there are a lot of things which just *seem* vaguely supernatural, and these are easier to go after, both politically and tactically. Indeed, if you are a scared real wizard who wants this to just go away, strategic manipulation towards fake targets keeps a lot of pressure off of you while the muggles kill themselves.

  And now, let's say you are a nigh-immortal wizard that could survive a nuclear war (e.g. Voldemort). The few things which could kill or incapacitate you are exotic muggle disasters in the relatively near future (runaway superintelligent AI, etc.)

  Throwing back the wider world a few centuries, while preserving knowledge among yourself, and possibly, but not necessarily, your easily-controllable proxy could be tactically advantageous, buying much needed time to validate that your techno-magical singularity won't go foom or be disrupted by something out of your control.

  You would have already started the war and taken over the country, but the dementors were a problem you couldn't quite handle until HJPEV showed up. A wizard-ruled world that you don't have to manage on a day-to-day basis, because it is paranoid and focused on control of muggles, is a significant, time-saving bonus.
