  Wait, is the implication here that the Comet King is *Sohu's father?* Is this new information? It would certainly explain the flying kayak.
  ```

  - u/over_who:
    ```
    I think this is the first time it has been so explicit.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      And yet it's *not* explicit. The one place where Sohu could have said "Yes, waiting for Father has always worked before", she said "him".
      ```

        >“Well, I think you’re wrong. Father believes God will save us.”
        >
        >“HE BELIEVES THAT HE WILL SAVE US, AND PLANS TO CREDIT GOD. THERE IS A DIFFERENCE.”

        Who's going to save the world, other than the Comet King?
        ```

        - u/None:
          ```
          I agree that it really looks like she's the Comet King's daughter. Just saying, we don't have explicit confirmation. There could be some other character who thought they'd save the world and credit God. Probability seems low, but non-zero.
          ```

          - u/callmebrotherg:
            ```
            She's Aaron's time-displaced daughter. 

            (Which is not mutually exclusive with her being the Comet King's daughter, obviously)
            ```

- u/Iconochasm:
  ```
  Uriel is rapidly becoming one of my favorite fictional characters.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Alicorn, who seems to have read the full story, gushed on and on and on on Twitter when Uriel and Sohu were introduced.
    ```

    - u/ulyssessword:
      ```
      > seems to have read the full story

      The whole story is written already?  That's the first I have heard of it.
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        I think so. It's hard to say. Scott [only gave 50% probability](http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/01/25/predictions-for-2016/) that he would not miss any Unsong updates this year. And yet in his 2015 predictions, he gave 60% probability that "I will not finish [project]", and he judged that prediction incorrect.

        I think the best hypothesis at the moment is that he has a complete first draft that his close friends have read, but that he's editing it into completed form week-by-week.
        ```

    - u/Iconochasm:
      ```
      This was the first time I can recall backing up to take in a characters lines again, for *every* line in a chapter.  When this is finished, I might open tabs for all the Uriel+Sohu chapters and just read them all alone, grinning until it hurts.

      "You can't be a deist!  You're an archangel!"
      ```

- u/None:
  ```
  So, if they had been reading Exodus when they crashed Apollo 8, would that have been a "sequel" injection?
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    If it had been the bit on stoning adulturesses, it would have been a harlot-bleed attack. If it had been the bit on money-changing, it would have been shekel-shock.
    ```

- u/Green0Photon:
  ```
  Uriel is literally /r/meirl.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Oh, really? Because I'd like to register a complaint about eye design, the heart could really be better put-together, and genetic diseases are just asinine.
    ```

    - u/Green0Photon:
      ```
      I AM SORRY. I AM NOT VERY GOOD AT BEING AN ARCHANGEL.
      ```

- u/Frommerman:
  ```
  Does Sohu's immortality persist through the death of the universe? It was, after all, a very good immortality ritual.

  Wait.

  >And on the seventh day, God rested, and he saw that his creation was very good.

  Sohu is the beginning of a new universe?
  ```
