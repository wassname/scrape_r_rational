## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

    how "completed" is it. Like fully completely, some major arcs completed? or barely started?
    ```

    - u/IICVX:
      ```
      It's not very completed. 

      The first two arcs are completed - there's been an introductory arc, then a sect ranking contest arc. 

      The current arc involves the MC going on a mission in the mortal world for the first time, and it's just about reaching its climax.

  I recently found a 4-panel webcomic called 1/0, a brilliant little piece of metafiction.  In short, it's an exploration of religion, philosophy and science through the lens of self-aware characters in a universe lacking a fourth wall.

  It's 1000 strips long, and I read it over a couple of days.  Well worth the read.

  Pinging u/BoxSparrow, who asked for stories that explore meta concepts, rather than writing a separate reply.

  I wrote 'The Fifth Defiance', a sort of superhero resistance story.  I've recced it on this forum a few times in answer to people asking for recs, but I figured what with finally getting it done I'd do a rec in the weekly official thread.

  [Nowhere Land](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/nowhere-land-jumpchain-multicross-horror.831104/) is a "horror" jumpchain where a junior member of an anti memetic threat organization finds himself at the mercy of an alien system that shunts him from world to world, it's unguessable goals further obscured by it's clearly broken state.

  While the protagonist travels through worlds of preexisting works (first pokemon then >!madoka magica!<) the story is for the most part about the mysteries that the author is setting up about what exactly is happening to the protagonist. While it's too early to know for sure whether there are satisfying answers to those mysteries, I really like what has been set up.

  If you enjoy strong mysteries, the protagonist/POV character having his mental state screwed with, and a dollop of lovecraftian horror, check this out! Just be aware that the first jump is a bit slower, to set up the characters, still very good, but once the second jump hits things pick up.

    I just binged this one, really enjoyed it.

    I liked how slow and steady it started off, it gave the horror parts more of an impact when they appeared.

  - u/Judah77:
    ```
    I tried it and the first jump was too slow for me.
    ```

    - u/reaper7876:
      ```
      I think that's a fair criticism. Those first few chapters were definitely where I was still getting my footing. Thanks for giving it a try, though!
      ```

      - u/Flashbunny:
        ```
        I'm now following it. Horror's not really my thing, but it's well-written enough that I'm enjoying it, mostly in spite of the genre. I don't suppose you've written anything else in a different genre?

        Also, your signature on SB has the following:
        >Nowhere Land (Jumpchain/Multicross Horror)
        >
        Jumps made: The Old Kingdom, Shadows of the Limelight, El Goonish Shive, Universal Paperclips, City of Angles, You Have To Burn The Rope, Achron.

        Is this referring to another story, or a hint?
        ```

        - u/reaper7876:
          ```
          I haven't written anything else in another genre, as of yet. I've got a couple in mind, but they wouldn't be until after this one's done.

          That part of my signature is in reference to the broader Jumpchain community. A while back (a couple years, by now), I made a few jump-docs, which are what you use to pick what powers you get and so on. Those are just the stories/universes I made them for. I've stopped making them at this point, but I leave that info there in case someone has a question for me.
          ```

          - u/Audere_of_the_Grey:
            ```
            Any particular reason why the Shadows doc uses 2d8 for domains? It gives them a weird distribution where glass, rust, and sound are very likely while earth, steel, and fire are very unlikely.

  Royal Road's trending fictions has some pretty good ones this week: 

  * [Mud's Mission](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/31919/muds-mission): Super good LitRPG with a non-human protagonist, who's characterized as a partially-bounded optimizer. Probably deserves a top level post. 
  * [Cosmic Interloper](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/31468/the-cosmic-interloper): A little bit like a crossover between Altered Carbon and a Sanderson novel; for the older fantasy aficionados here, it's kind of like an updated version of [The Cyborg and the Sorcerors](http://www.watt-evans.com/thecyborgandthesorcerers.shtml). The basic premise is that an augmented human gets isekai'd into a magical world, and shenanigans ensue. 
  * [Fantasy World Epsilon 30-10](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/31129/fantasy-world-epsilon-30-10): The main character is very similar to Jason Asano from He Who Fights With Monsters, except instead of getting isekai'd on accident he's doing it on purpose. It's mostly about a semi-modern society as represented by a single MC gently storming through a classic medieval fantasy environment. Does contain a couple of explicit parts.

  And something that's fun and totally not rational (though it hits a lot of the tropes and themes people here seem to like):

  * [My Next Life as a Villainess: All Routes Lead to Doom!](https://www.crunchyroll.com/my-next-life-as-a-villainess-all-routes-lead-to-doom): the title is very descriptive. It's like if Kaleidoscope was set in a light dating game. The main character uses her knowledge of the game's plot to try and save herself from inevitable doom, like your average rational isekaier - without ever reassessing the current state of things, namely that she's already changed the lives of every character to the point where they're unlikely to want to, you know, kill her. She's also incredibly dense and kinda dumb, but in a lovable golden retriever way.

    I've been a bit disillusioned about reading 1-2 month old fictions on RR, got tired of following things that turn bad after a while and make it hard for me to drop it because of sunk cost.

    &#x200B;

    But I've been loving Villainess, it's really fun in a turn off my brain while I eat dinner show. Although the joke is starting to get old, which seems to be a plus for the anime with only 12 episodes and a negative for the novel. 

    &#x200B;

    The format is quite good and has potential, but the author decided to make it a harem, with an oblivious MC, when it would have been more interesting and fun without that trope. Somebody could become really popular by making several good short 80k word stories following a similar format, without competing with all these 1kk word epics we see in webfiction.
    ```

    - u/xachariah:
      ```
      To be fair to villainess, much like Harry Potter it has a strong S1 cutoff point, which is bad if it doesn't match up with anime seasons. The Last couple episodes have been filling up time until the story can make a final approach to the ending.

      TLDR, filler now but it should be a good finish.

      Sure, I can post them afterwards. I'll post a few here, since you asked:

      Smelling a thunderstorm. This is true. The build-up of energy in the formation of a thunderstorm causes the production of nitric oxide. This in turn, breaks down Oxygen (O2) into singular Oxygen (O) atoms. The O atoms combine with O2 molecules to become Ozone (O3). Some of the Ozone is pushed down to Earth level by downdrafts.

      Multiple bee stings causing an allergy. False. Bee allergies are largely genetic. If you get stung multiple times, you'd build a resistance rather than develop an allergy (beekeepers will usually get stung on purpose in order to develop this). It is possible to develop an allergy to something, though the science behind it is unknown (theories are either down to increased hygiene causing immune system issues or nutritional deficiencies).

      Chopping the back of someone's neck to knock them out. Ineffective. You knock someone out either by choking them out (accomplished in martial arts by hitting or grappling the front of their neck, or striking inbetween their shoulderblades) or by scrambling their brain (by punching their head hard). Even then, knock outs tend to only last seconds, up to a couple of minutes. Longer, and you've done some possibly permanent damage.
      ```

      - u/RetardedWabbit:
        ```
        Multiple stings can kind of cause an allergy by exacerbating a previously unnoticed allergy. Allergic responses get worse with repeated immune system activation through a process called sensitization. If you ask people with severe allergies they will often tell you that the first time wasn't too bad but they got worse. 1st time hives and rashes, 2nd added difficulty swallowing, 3rd hard to breath for example. 

        I don't recall Hunter x Hunters usage of bee allergies though.

    I’ve been actively picking out the best bits of MHA writing on AO3 for over a year, and I have to say that MHA does not lend itself well to any sort of rational deconstruction, even when people make it more realistic and complicated in clever ways.

    I think this is mostly because the premise that “everyone has superpowers” is incompatible with a setting where “society strongly resembles modernity”. Also because powers that are strong enough to be truly threatening and interesting are too dangerous for the integrity of the setting when used in a clever way. 

    Shigaraki and Kurogiri alone are a combo that could do untold damage to infrastructure. Guys like Overhaul just...do exist. Think about the absurd terrorism potential of Yaoyorozu’s ability for like, one second. This is barely taking into account the incredibly dangerous Quirk combos that definitely do statistically exist amongst the population. But even if dangerous, immoral, motivated people could wreak havoc with their quirks, they won’t, because the implications of their abilities mean that either society would not exist in its canon form or that there needs to be a special in-universe justification. And eventually those justifications would start stacking up into something that is clearly ludicrous and would deprive a ratfic of its spooky rational power.
    ```

    - u/dinoseen:

      I agree completely. I'm not looking for only rational deconstructions, however, basically just anything that the people on this sub would recommend. Like I look up "best mha fics" on google or another sub, and I just get a bunch of shipping nonsense, but I trust people on this sub to give recs to actually good fics.

        [Subject, a Comprehensive Report](https://archiveofourown.org/works/16037609/chapters/37435250): Izuku pursues a career as an analyst early and ends up interning with Night Eye, unfortunately being drawn into the mystery of All for One. Unfinished and not updated since Nov, but I remember it being fairly solid.

        [Pro Hero Metal Bat](https://archiveofourown.org/works/14666679/chapters/33883275): I have a soft spot for this one. It avoids most of the problems that crossover or pseudo-crossovers with One Punch Man tend to get into, even if it seems to hit several of the common “Quirkless Hero” ones head-on. Updates verrrrrry slowly. Most shonen-typical of this list.

        [Conversations With A Cryptid](https://archiveofourown.org/works/11808918/chapters/26640231): I remember this being interesting. Has an unfinished sequel, but I didn’t really like it as much & I think the first is okay on its own.

        [A Study In Firsts](https://archiveofourown.org/works/16340741/chapters/38231207): I...uh...lost track of this one a while ago and remembered it for this rec, so who knows what the most recent chapters are like. But I remember the first bit being a good and cute exploration of the implications of “quirks are biological abilities” on teen awkwardness. Thankfully not a sex thing.

        Most of the rest I’ve read are low-tier knockoffs of canon, boring assemblages of harems/excessive feel-good tropes/the same stale fanon or ideas, well written but explicitly shippy, disgusting sex garbage, or dross. Though I’m sure I’ve forgotten or missed at least twice this number of genuinely good things, especially since I’ve made no move to go check my SB/SV history.

        You can get a bit more mileage if you lower your standards for shipping, cleverness, originality, or excessive self-pleasuring via overwrought superpower harems or grimdark genre-shift revenge edgelords. There are some redeemable fics with just a little bit too much of some of those. But it’s not worth it unless you really like MHA.

          This has pretty much been my experience. Even my opinion of From Muddy Waters has been lowered after realizing "traumatized Midoriya with a secret quirk retreads canon" is as common as "Dark but not evil Harry" used to be for Harry Potter.

          There's very little originality and the character/reader fics have somehow managed to get a serious foothold, eating into the surrounding discussion of fanworks.

          I feel like some of the problems will go away on their own as the story reaches some kind of end point, the way Naruto did when it hit the timeskip, but maybe that's wishful thinking.
          ```

      - u/nytelios:

        The only MHA fic I've enjoyed is a crossover, less MHA than Oregairu, which is probably why I liked it. It's hard to get into the perspective of MHA characters when their canon selves are walking shounen tropes in a 11/10 shounen world.

    Nothing with that word count, sadly.

    Hero Class Civil Warfare is up there,  but it's more of a heist movie than a rational narrative. Midoriya is assigned the role of Kingpin in a hero class joint exercise and puts everyone through an ordeal that makes canon feel like a giant missed opportunity.

    You could try One Yen Hero, but it's not super long just yet. Midoriya has a power from Mistborn that forces him to manage resources. Sidesteps canon somewhat by sticking him in class 1-B.

      Thanks for the recs. The author is seriously writing a mistborn fic without reading era 2? Golly. I hope they fix that so they can actually use all the metals.

  If self-promotions are allowed in this thread, then I'd like to offer a Naruto fanfiction I'm currently actively updating - I've just hit 40k words and I have another update queued to go. It's intended to be rational but I'm not sure how accurately I'm hitting the mark. Regardless, I feel that this sub might enjoy it anyway.

  [Spire](https://archiveofourown.org/works/7722541/chapters/17600416) is a story that originally started as a subversion of time travel fanfiction, where I wanted to put the focus on the characters that didn't have future knowledge, so the reader would simply see changes rippling out and not know who was causing them. It's in a somewhat similar vein to *Team 7's Ascension* or *Shinobi: Team 7* in terms of its approach to canon, and the general 'feel' of the world, although it's less violent and dark.

  > Naruto's hopeful, Sasuke's confused, Kakashi's an alcoholic, and Sakura really doesn't want to die. This wasn't what they'd expected from Ninja life, but as Konoha's enemies gather, there's no time for regrets. A strong Team Seven AU.

  I'd love any feedback, especially constructive criticism or what people felt didn't work well/was a turnoff.
  ```

  - u/Dufaer:
    ```
    What is the "a strong Team Seven AU" in the summary supposed to tell a prospective reader? Team 7 was pretty strong in canon already. Kakashi was not an alcoholic in canon, so that makes is AU, I guess. OK.

    This summary makes it sound like this is a generic edgier Naruto rewrite with more OP protagonists.

    You need a hook here. "Sasuke is confused" is not one; definitely not, if you mention it in the middle of other changes.

    The first scene *does* provide one, but it really should be in the summary, if you want to catch prospective readers' attention.
    ```

    - u/waylandertheslayer:
      ```
      Thanks for the detailed breakdown!

      I think some of the summary issues are due to the limitations of fanfiction.net (where I use the same summary), which incentivises using phrasing that is familiar to the fandom-specific community there. That said, the summary for this story is something I've struggled with a fair bit in the past.

      I'm trying to hit three key notes - firstly, I want to indicate that a focus of the story will be the characterisation and development of the four members of Team Seven, who have somewhat different personalities to canon. Secondly, there's an overarching plot that doesn't necessarily match the canon plot directly, rather than this being a slice-of-life ramble. And thirdly, the story spends a lot of time on combat/combat-preparation aspects of ninja life.

      With regards to the hook, I think some (definitely not all) people find the first line intriguing enough to get them to start reading. However, this clearly didn't do that for you. Do you have any suggestions for a stronger hook?

      I'm happy to hear that the first scene had a strong hook - I've rewritten that chapter a few times and I struggled a lot with making the opening engaging.

    You explain too much. How can there be any tension when you are interrupting scenes with several lines long explanations. Also the thoughts of your characters feel cringy, not sure why but it feels like it. Couldn't get through the first chapter.

  Two things: I've been reading all the stories on [**Ascent Universe**](https://ascentuniverse.wordpress.com/) and throughly enjoying them. There's a main story arc which I could describe as a rationalist reimagining on Battlefield Earth by L Ron Hubbard (evil occupying aliens, resistance to fight them but all is now what it seems!) and a bunch of out-there stories set in the same world.

  The other, the [**foundation antimemetics series**](http://www.scp-wiki.net/antimemetics-division-hub), a Cosmic horror which really seems to fit with our [current crisis.](https://www.reddit.com/r/qntm/comments/gp7nca/we_were_all_adam_wheeler/)

  It's really a story about a melding of both horrifyingly outside-context X-risk and horrifyingly incomprehensible human evil - two things that don't go together in real life. 

  The reason 3125 is worse than real life viruses or real life evil antihuman ideologies is because it combines the relentless, undying inhuman aspect of viruses and other threats with the active evil and malice and desire to inflict suffering as an end goal, valuable in itself, of Fasicsm. So really it is a bit of both.

  This is not related to the rational content in the slightest, but I tend to *really* enjoy recommendations on this sub, so our opinions must more or less align.

  I kinda want to watch *Durarara!!*, but I don't know if it's any good (the reviews tend to be mixed), and with my enormous backlog of other stuff, I'm too afraid to commit to something I might strongly dislike. Those who have seen this anime, what is your opinion on it? (Bonus question: if you've also read the LN, is it a faithful adaptation?)
  ```

  - u/sl236:
    ```
    (I have not read the LN)

    FWIW we really enjoyed the anime. The same way that March Comes In Like a Lion is a really well done character study, Durarara felt to me like a really well made study of a city precinct, by someone who really loves the place.

    It starts pretty much as it means to go on; each episode answers a bunch of questions the previous one left open, while leaving new hooks unclear; if you’re not enjoying it by end of ep2 you probably wouldn’t want to carry on.
    ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    It is faithful to the LN up to where I read (somewhere during x2) but I think the show is presented much better.

    I really liked Durarara. It's a fun character driven story that shines in how disjointed it is and captures the chaotic interactions around the district. Some of these interactions don't really pay off till much later in the show though.

    Also the soundtrack slaps. If anyone knows any similar shrill sounding jazz send recs
    ```

  - u/Anderkent:
    ```
    When I watched it I was quite excited by the first couple of episodes but felt that the show didn't deliver what it teased.
    ```

  - u/Noumero:
    ```
    It's been a while since I watched it, but I'd enjoyed it in its entirety, and had considered it one of the best anime I've seen. Long but well-paced and lacking in filler, with interesting characters and a plot that is neither clichéd nor stupid. It's possible that if I rewatched it now, my opinion would change, but I wouldn't expect the change to be major.

    Haven't read the LN.
    ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Could never get into it personally. 

    Preferred Hakata Tonkotsu Ramens personally.
