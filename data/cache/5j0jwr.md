## [D] Sunday Writing Skills Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Sunday thread for discussions on writing skills!

Every genre has its own specific tricks and needs, and rational and rationalist stories are no exception. Do you want to discuss with your community of fellow /r/rational fans...

* Advice on how to more effectively apply any of the [tropes](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RationalFic)?

* How to turn a rational story into a rationalist one?

* Get feedback about a story's characters, themes, plot progression, prosody, and other English literature topics?

* Considering issues outside the story's plain text, such as titles, cover design, included imagery, or typography?

* Or generally gab about the problems of being a writer, such as maintaining focus, attracting and managing beta-readers, marketing, making it free or paid, and long-term community-building?

Then comment below!

Setting design should probably go in the Wednesday Worldbuilding thread.

  I'm now beginning to fill with nerves and dread about my upcoming JaNoWriMo (January Novel Writing Month), for which I have even taken some time off work. I'm writing a paranormal romance story which I summarise as "gay vampires kissing" though it's obviously more complicated than that.

  My sources of nerves/dread, to which I am going to write counter-arugments:

  - I will not be able to write something I am happy with (Counter: Of course I will be happy with it, because it will be my story that I wanted to write. Of course I will be unhappy with it because I obsessively edit everything I write.)

  - I will write the scenes I like, but the boring stuff in between will be missed. (Counter: If stuff in between the scenes I like is boring, then yadda yadda through it like *most novels I read do*)

  - My dialogue will be bad. (Counter: I have a good sense of William's voice. Red's voice I have very little sense of, but my roleplaying partner will edit things to fix them up, and lots of the dialog will be based on roleplay skeletons, so there's no concern).

  - I have taken the mantle of having part of it set in WW2 which I am not personally interested in, and I might screw that up from a realism point of view. (Counter: It mostly happens with WW2 as a very far-away backdrop. I have a friend who is a WW2 buff who said he'd be willing to read important scenes. I am writing paranormal romance, not historical fiction, so realism, whilst important, is not vital)

  - I will write something and share it here but people won't like it. (Counter: I'm not writing Animorphs: The Reckoning. I can't expect people to like it. It's not *for* /r/rational, this community has just inspired me to do JaNoWriMo in the first place and also to improve the rationality of my stories.  Other counter: The sort of people who enjoy paranormal romance might not enjoy A:tR (BLASPHEMY), so it might be more popular than I think)

  - I will write something and share it here and people will say "this is not rational fiction why are you posting it here". (Counter: other people might say they like it. Might be an opportunity to discuss rational aspects to fiction in general)

  - I will not get it finished. (Counter: so what? You can keep writing after January. Also, you are taking like a week off work for this, and you are motivated, so you are sure to acheive your goal word count provided you don't slack off. This fear will help you with that. If you acheive your goal word count but don't finish the story, that's fine. It just means the story was longer than you thought.)

  - I will get it finished but the people important to me in my life (partners, parents) who I share it with will think it's lame. (Counter: so what? They think Survivor is lame but you know they're wrong.)

  Thanks for giving me a place to write all that out! I feel a lot better now. If anyone else is feeling nervous or insecure about their writing, I am happy to attempt to reassure you as best I can.

  **Crowdsourcing for ideas?**

  I have an urge to post a forbidden 'scenario' thread to /r/rational, asking readers to take on the role of journalists faced with a certain story, in order to elicit a wider variety of questions than I'd manage on my own. How might I improve such an attempt at crowdsourcing, to improve the quality of the responses I get?

  Eg, "It's 2038, employment is so scarce you're lucky to have a part-time journalism gig to supplement your negative income tax credits, and there hasn't been anything new today on the proposed Convention to Propose an Amendment to Balance the Budget, so you're chasing smaller stories. You're virtually attending an AMA/scrum/press-conference about one of those digital copies of human brains, who accidentally got run really fast for who-knows-how-long, got brain damage - something about having to chop its brain-program into a hundred pieces - and just exited a hearing that judged it's as competent to handle his affairs as any of the rest of its kind. It seems to have picked for its own avatar some sort of cute-and-fluffy centaur-shaped mouse-thing in a vest. And the prosecutor's there, says that it was a fresh copy, and it's been isolated, so it doesn't know anything about the world after its original human died in the teens. What questions do you try to get answered? Which questions get up-voted to the top of the queue?"
