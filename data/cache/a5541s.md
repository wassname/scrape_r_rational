  **On details:**

  Alexander noted that little details are important to selling a sense of place, and I'd add that this applies to other things, like selling a character.  I think that capturing the *attitude* of a character is a critical part of selling accuracy.  When it comes to police procedurals, there are little inaccuracies of process (like Alexander noted, with investigators sometimes picking up evidence without taking the time to document), but apart from the technical details, there's also the fact that police officers tend to talk in a certain way, and often have a certain kind of attitude that matches the way they approach their job.  Something as simple as the kind of language that a cop uses when talking to a witness can go a long way toward selling me on the realism of that character.

  Daystar mentioned The Wire as an excellent show that is often applauded for its realism, and while some of the realism of The Wire is in the procedural details and showing the parts of certain professions that you don't often see on TV, a huge part of the realism of The Wire comes from the attention to detail when constructing the characters in terms of the way they talk and the attitude they have toward the job.  In that sense, I think that the fact that The Wire is a character study probably contributes a lot to its realism.  David Simon was just as dedicated to realistically depicting police officers as he was to depicting the police profession.  That's a subtle distinction, but I think it's an important one.

  The 2013 film Gravity is often criticized as being inaccurate.  Some of the complaints are about scientific inaccuracies, like the fact that there's no feasible way to get from the Hubble Space Telescope to the International Space Station like we see in the film, and the fact that the astronauts in the movie frequently survive impacts that should seriously maim them and come out without so much as a scratch.  However, I'd argue that most of the film's problems with "realism" stem from the fact that the fact that main characters don't *behave* like astronauts.  They're not acting like highly trained professionals who have spent an entire career training so that they don't buckle under pressure (and specifically been selected as the individuals most qualified for this job, as there's plenty of qualified people who want to go to space). Something about the way the characters behave rings false.

  This is also how you can have authors who write speculative fiction about space marines who carry around plasma rifles and fight aliens in 1/3 gravity, and actual military service members will write in to tell them that they really communicated what it's like to be a soldier, because despite none of the facts matching up with reality, the author is still able to capture the feeling of camaraderie, how a commanding officer actually thinks and talks, and what it's like to deal with certain kinds of trauma.  "Military fiction" as a genre is much more about the idea of what it means to be a soldier much more than any particular setting.

  This is also a huge part of why I enjoy listening to interviews (especially long-form interviews that were rare until podcasting became a thing) and reading creative non-fiction (such as memoirs and literary journalism), because a lot of times some of the best details can come from little off-hand remarks that people wouldn't even think of as being notable parts of their profession that were worth documenting.  If I wanted to write a story about astronauts, there's a good chance I'd spend more time reading memoirs and autobiographies of astronauts than reading books about aerospace engineering and astrophysics.

  **On research:**

  I think a large part of being knowledgeable on a subject is knowing the correct answer to ask.  For an example, consider gun research: Alice knows that an AK-47 is an assault rifle.  Bob knows what an AK-47 is, but he's not sure if it's an assault rifle or a machine gun.  And Charlie doesn't even know that "assault rifle" and "machine gun" are terms that refer to different kinds of weapons and can't be used interchangeably.  I think most people would group Bob and Charlie together as "both people are ignorant about guns," but in terms of understanding, Bob is just a question away from Alice's level of knowledge, whereas Charlie doesn't even know that the question needs to be asked.  Bob may be ignorant, but he's aware of his ignorance in a way that will prevent him from embarrassing himself by calling an AK-47 a "machine gun" in a completed manuscript.

  In a lot of my preliminary research, my main goal is to turn myself from a Charlie into a Bob, trying to turn unknown unknowns into known unknowns.  For me, turning a list of questions into a list of answers is usually the easy part, so the part I put the most effort into is figuring out which questions I need to ask.  Again, this is a place were I find long-form interviews and things like memoirs to be more helpful than reference books; hearing someone from a particular field just talk for a couple hours can reveal certain insights that I wouldn't even think to ask for.

  Usually when I put my writing in front of an expert to say "please sanity-check this for me," the main thing I'm looking for them is to identify those unknown unknowns, the things that I didn't even realize were questions that I needed to ask.  And when talking to experts, I try to ask the kind of questions that I don't expect them to get often.  (If you don't know a good question along these lines, you can cheat and say "What's something about your field/profession that you wish you could talk about more often, but no one ever thinks to ask you about?")

  **On finding the correct questions to ask:**

  One specific book I can recommend is *Fifty Inventions That Shaped the Modern Economy* by Tim Harford.  I think that on some level, a lot of us understand the fact that certain technologies like paper, the plow, and clocks radically transformed the world, but these are so often taken for granted that certain things like "people have a synchronized way to keep track of what time it is" might go overlooked when writing a scene in a historical setting (or historical-based fantasy setting).

  Also, usually when we think about "technology" we think about things in the domain of science and engineering: inventions like gunpowder, germ theory, and so on, but social technologies can also be tremendously transformative.  For example, recently I've been reading *Accomplishments of the Duke's Daughter* (specifically the manga, though it's also a light novel), which is one of those isekai stories about someone from the 21st century who gets transported to a medieval setting and uses their modern knowledge to "uplift" the world they've been transported to, except in this case the main character was an accountant, and the main things she brings back are social technology (like orphanages) and financial technology (like having an actual bank that provides lending services).  Concepts like "progressive income tax" are actually pretty modern but we often tend to take them for granted (and other concepts/innovations that make these technologies work, like the fact that income tax brackets are marginal).

  Toward the end of the episode, I believe that Daystar mentioned the genre of Youtube videos "professional reacts to TV show depicting the field that they are a domain expert in," e.g. "real doctor reacts to Dr. House," and I've found these to be tremendously helpful (and entertaining), because while they're often good at explaining why certain huge flaws in TV shows are inaccurate, they're also really good at pointing out the small things in TV shows (that might have been added as an off-hand remark or joke) and pointing out why they're inaccurate.  And, on the other hand, sometimes they'll also take the time to mention that certain things *are* accurate, which often take the form of small details that I might not have picked up on.  One of my favorite of these is [Legal Eagle](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpa-Zb0ZcQjTCPP1Dx_1M8Q), one of my favorite episodes being [Real Lawyer Reacts to the first episode of How to Get Away with Murder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adx4of7Pnvo), because besides dealing with things related to the legal system, it also gets at the "smaller" parts of a lawyer's experience, like "This isn't the kind of conversation two first-year law students would be having," and "This isn't the kind of thing a law professor would do on the first day of class."

  I'm not sure whether to be proud that Alexander knows what an [Angler Fish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9t7E4amWDqI) is, or disappointed that he doesn't remember the name.

    One of the reasons that I keep a lot of notes is that I have trouble remembering things, and (IMO) keeping a lot of notes actually exacerbates that, because my brain says "okay, it's written down somewhere, no need to keep that in storage". My typical research habits are also such that I do a deep dive, and then fairly quickly forget a lot of what was learned. I've heard other people liken this to being a "temporary expert", and while I don't think that I'm *actually* an expert, this is sometimes what it feels like, especially the "temporary" part, as details fade away and leave only an impression (and usually the pathways necessary to find/synthesize the information again).
