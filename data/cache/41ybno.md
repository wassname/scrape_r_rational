## A challenge for r/rational

### Post:

on http://www.shamchat.com/ , you assume a persona and interact with someone else, also assuming a persona. My challenge is simple-- call yourself "starfish alien" (or some variant) and attempt to make first contact with people you interact with. As I write this, I'm trying to get across very simple base-12 arithmetic to someone called "a superheroine"

feel free to use draw.to to create basic diagrams.

  ^--- Most successful attempt out of 10. Most people immediately 'nexted'.

    I guess he nexted because you discarded his hook and gave an answer that didn't allow him any way to proceed. You want to take your opponent's idea (that you chose him) and "Yes, and..." it by inventing a reason to have chosen him, ideally in a format that allows him to "Yes, and..." you.

  I know it's a month late, but I wanted to try this anyways. After about 7 people instantly skipping me, Lex Luther, of all people, decided to humor me. I was making things up as I went along, but [here's](http://www.shamchat.com/7b2f564c/) the results.
