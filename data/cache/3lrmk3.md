  Could you give a quick blurb about what the story's about?
  ```

  - u/Subrosian_Smithy:
    ```
    Sure. It's basically about a man who gets a power ring configured for use by an alien species, not for humanity. It's not even associated with a color visible to normal humans, and the protagonist has to learn how to use it from the ground up.

    There's also some interesting commentary about what it means for a soulless, ordinary meatbag human to get inserted into a cosmology where souls are real.

      The last part sounds a little like *With This Ring*.

        It feels a lot like With This Ring in ~~that~~ many respects. It hasn't really explored much of anything thus far, though. But yeah, missing name + no soul, DC universe, ring on arrival... this is a WTR-fanfic. 

        (side note: Not necessarily a bad thing! WTR is good, people should read that if they aren't already; The story-only thread seems intimidatingly long but honestly each post [posted daily!] is pretty short, and the whole thing is usually really good.)

      Oh, so it's an alternate story about the Green Lantern. And 276um describes the color of the ring; now I get it.

      What parts of it are SI? Did the author put his personality and/or knowledge into the main character?

      EDIT: It seems he put his personality but either nerfed his knowledge of the universe or doesn't know a lot in the first place

  This is by the author of *[People Lie](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3745099)*, which is possibly my third-favorite Naruto story (tied with *[Naruto's Compensation](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4611673)*).

    > Naruto's Compensation

    So, I greatly enjoyed People Lie, and also thought Time Braid was well written, so I went to read the above assuming it would be of similar quality.

    It really, really isn't. It reads like it was written by a 14 year old. The grammar isn't bad, but the plot is mediocre and the descriptions vague. Puppets are seen as a badly-explained solution to all problems, and the obviously most powerful ninja technique evar.

    Naruto self-teaches himself to Kage level power by age 12, etc. 

    The answer to literally every problem is 'chakra strings'.

    I'm only halfway through it at this point, but I can't see it getting much better.
    ```

    - u/ToaKraka:
      ```
      (shrugs) I thought it was an interesting deconstruction, since it's explicitly shown in canon (Kankurou vs. Naruto/Konohamaru and Chiyo vs. Sasori) that chakra strings can be used in this fashion, without preparation.

      In some other story (I think it was *[Scorpion's Disciple](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5166693)*), Sasori explicitly says, "Chakra strings can be attached *only* to prepared seals. If you could attach chakra strings to anything without preparation, puppetry would be the *least* of chakra strings' uses." So it's nice to see different interpretations of canon.

        True, they can certainly be useful in the same way that telekinesis can be useful. But just for the most egregious examples...

        * Penetrating the otherwise impenetrable seal on the Ororchimaru v Hokage fight at the chunin exam
        * Reaching "hundreds of miles" to allow Naruto to basically play an RTS, controlling an entire army consciously and fully without even using shadow clones for parallel processing
        * Ripping Kusanagi out of Orochimaru's gut. (if this works, why not just rip out the organs of all of your opponents from the other side of the continent?)
        * Sealing human beings inside objects for storage to kidnap them without ever being within sensory range of them. Including Sannin and Kage level opponents. Guess literally nobody else ever thought of that or how to counter it.
        * On that note, he's got mastery level sealing skills without ever being trained in it.

        Some things are alright, the deconstruction of the lack of secrecy in Ninja culture as shown in Naruto is good, the training of his team to be actual ninja is also good. 

        But nothing ever seems to even remotely challenge him, except his short meeting with Sasori who I can already tell is going to be his only real challenge because puppets are just so good guys I swear.

          That one [may actually be canon.](http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/F%C5%ABinjutsu_Trap)  I'm not clear on whether it can be set to activate on a trigger, but otherwise it's what you're talking about.
