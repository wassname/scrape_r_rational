  Font and formatting made me nope out - I lasted until to 'turn the page you know you want to'. No thank you, my eyes are screaming bloody murder already.

    Author-sama, I remember pointing this out the last time this was posted! Why did you not listen!

    [edit] Switch Firefox to Reader Mode using the icon to the right of the address bar.

    [edit] This is such amazingly weird porn, it's like it's this hot fetish story with hints and flashes of a surprisingly systematic magic system behind it.

    [edit]

    > “I’M NOT A PARASITE!”
    > Ugh, too open, words are in my head, ew, ow...

    No don't be silly, weird puritan-wraith, clearly she's-

    > She’s a symbiote.

    I KNOW RIGHT

    oh god I want to hug everyone in this story

    oh god speaking as a programmer this is just such utterly blatant wish fulfillment but I DONT CARE

    this is like the porn version of wizardry

    > Once I’m being physically dragged it doesn’t matter if I organized the whole thing, right? This is **so** topping from the bottom

    why do I keep cracking up at this this is amazing

    OH GOD I JUST HIT _THAT_ BIT AND OH GOD AAA FUCK THE HATERS THIS IS RATIONALFIC AS FUCK, LITERALLY

    > "You turned into a catgirl!" --not an actual quote

    [edit]

    aw man I hit the end :(

      I wasn't kidding with that [HF] flag. That's all I'll say.

    If you click on the 'turn the page you know you want to' to go to the next page, there will be a symbol in the top left corner. Clicking on it will open a sidebar for options to enable or disable "Sexy Font" or "Glowy Shit".

    If you got to my [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5esm2q/rthfnsfw_the_care_and_feeding_of_magical_creatures/daffecw/), I even explain how to change the page to a No Style format which makes a standard black words on white screen layout.

    UPDATE EDIT: There's now a Print-Friendly Option for black words on white.
    ```

  - u/Soren_Tycho:
    ```
    Please do nope back in. The default font in the main text is merely normal-serif, and I've now changed the front cover blurb to match this, *and* added a black-on-white option.
    ```

      Is there an epub of this? I massively prefer reading offline.
      ```

      - u/Soren_Tycho:
        ```
        I haven't got around to adding epub to my build script's output, but if you print it'll print out in a nice printer-friendly format (black on white, nav stuff hidden) suitable for print-to-PDF.
        ```

        - u/nerdguy1138:
          ```
          Epub can handle colored text just fine. Can I get that all in one page, so I can just throw it into calibre?
          ```

  I spent some time exploring the site and once you get past the prologue or get to the page that says "1. Eat Cute", there's a symbol in the top left corner. Click on that and it will bring up a side bar with links to the chapters and other important links. At the very top of the sidebar are options to disable the glow and fonts to only get white (or a very light blue) Times New Roman words on a black screen.

  For anyone who wants to know how to change the page style on Firefox to black words on a white screen, click your ALT key immediately to the left of the spacebar. At the very top of your screen, click on View, then Page Style, and then No Style.

  It'll change your current page into black Times New Roman words on white as a standard html page. However, it gets fairly tricky to figure out which character is saying what words because the author relies on having different font colors to show which character is currently thinking or speaking.

  PS /u/Soren_Tycho I strongly recommend that you inform people about your font options instead of assuming that people will find it. Otherwise you could lose readers who only see the text and give up after the first page without taking the time to look around. Put the warning right next to "Hey! C'mon, turn the page. You know you want to." Also is there a possibility to have an option of black (and gray) words on a white screen? It would be very helpful for some readers who prefer that.

  PPS Only got as far as the first page after the prologue, but so far it's kinda hilarious and I plan on withholding my opinion until I've eaten something (why did I decide checking out /r/rational before lunch was a good idea?!?) and finished reading up to the current chapter.

  PPPS I asked the author how much s/he had written so far [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4h6zmq/rthfnsfw_imprecisely_bound_demons_or_some/d2odm31/) and considering that comment of 175,000 words of story + 30,000 sidestories was six months ago, I believe we can expect updates on Friday for a good long while. :)

  As promised [way back when](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4h6zmq/rthfnsfw_imprecisely_bound_demons_or_some/), I'm posting this here because I owe a debt of gratitude to this community for even picking up a keyboard at all.

  So, thanks, and click if you dare. Yes, this is monster-girl porn, but it's also a story about a relationship with a non-human intelligence, coherent extrapolated volition, and one *hell* of a paper-clipper.
  ```

- u/Soren_Tycho:
  ```
  Okay folks, chapter 9 in which we see what happens [spoiler](/s "after you probably got blown up by an angel") is now up, because it's Friday-ish.

  ALSO I've added a black-on-white option ('Printer Friendly', available by clicking the Eye-of-Sade in the upper left to get the menu), and fixed the font on the title pape.

  ALSO ALSO if you export to PDF the CSS will detect a non-screen medium and give you a nice printer-friendly format regardless of settings.
  ```

  - u/xamueljones:
    ```
    I recommend to just post the new chapter as a new post. I doubt the mods will have problem with it. A lot of the people who first clicked on the link are not going to check back to read the new comments.

    You can also take advantage to inform people of the font/coloring changes you made.

    Also what do you mean by export to PDF?
    ```

    > I take a step forward and, lifting her tail from her breasts, take the soft barb in my hands, stroking and exploring it. In this state it’s soft

    soft barb is soft, word rep

    rest is good
    ```

  - u/Anderkent:
    ```
    Kinda sucks that printer friendly takes away next chapter links :(
    ```

- u/FeepingCreature:
  ```
  So when are you continuing this? _:puppy dog eyes:_
  ```

  - u/xamueljones:
    ```
    It says on the site that it "Updates every Friday-ish".
    ```

- u/CouteauBleu:
  ```
  The writing is kiiiiind of bad. "Stereotypical Harry Potter fic" bad.

  Also, the beginning is a bit boring. I'd expect the story to either start with some action (a sex scene, the succubus running for her life, whatever), or give me some idea of the context of the story, and what the stakes are. Is anyone in danger? What is even happening?
  ```

    ```
    > The writing is kiiiiind of bad. "Stereotypical Harry Potter fic" bad.

    Eeeeh, it's not that bad. Mostly grammatical and ortographic, miles ahead of a stereotypical HP fic :P
    ```
