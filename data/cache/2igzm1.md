## [RT][MK]Log Horizon - Anime

### Post:

So, I started watching this anime just a few days ago after stumbling upon a positive description of it.

About an year ago I ended up talking to friends about the (in)famous Sword Art Online anime that they were starting to watch, and I ended up reading the novel on which it was based. It was a small bit of a mind-numb reading, but nothing too bad until I started the second volume and threw the container where the digital copy was across the room is disgust. As such, I was quite reticent about diving into another show about MMORPG-turned-real-world, but this did seem to be quite a bit different. The following is the description of my reactions as I went along.

Episode 1-5: Okay, so nice setting, reasonable characters. Some annoying anime tropes but I guess that's expected. It's nice how there's a heavy element of mechanics explanation and exploration, and how they work within the framework of the game.

Episode 6: Oh, the main character just got a goal? That's nice, he's focused and it seems like the first arc of the story is rounding up then, that's nice.

Episode 7-9: Wait, is he conquering the MMORPG world through economics? That... makes perfect sense. This almost seems like something I would see on r/rational. And wow, those were quite the checkmate moves, I'm enjoying this more and more.

Episode 10: ...THIS CHANGES EVERYTHING...SQUARED. It appears this will now turn into an anime version of the 2YE.

And that was how I ended up here sharing this. Now if you don't mind I'm going to continue watching because the 2nd season is currently starting its airing schedule.

  I agree 100% with this recommendation.

  You should watch the first episode of the second season.

  It's even more economics.

  "So, we need some money."

  "How much?"

  "More than exists."

  "Don't worry, it isn't actually a problem."

  Also, episode.. 20ish? Where the reveal in episode 10 finally comes to fruition is...

  Really good.

  You'll know it when it happens. There is a big beam of light and everything. It is munchkinism at its finest.

    The second season's out?!

    Having just seen 'it' happen in episode 20, I've got to say it was everything I could have hoped.

    Like some people said above it seems to slow down a bit between episodes 10 to 20, but to me it just seems to vary its tone instead of losing momentum. Sometimes it's more of characters muchkining their way through their reality(in exceptionally awesome ways), other times it's political manuvering interspecced with character moments interactions which revolve a lot around self-improvement and achieving their objectives through strategy and work.

    It's quite a bit of a slow burner through 'big' events, but I sometimes find myself so entranced by the verbal joust in the dialogues that the 20 minutes of the episode just fly by.

      And just for reference for anyone who might be getting curious about it the big event in episode 20 [is](#s " managing to bestow immortality upon an NPC through munchkin magic").
      ```

- u/Anderkent:
  ```
  Yeah I liked the first 10-12 episodes too. Then it lost momentum and turned into a slice of life with characters that I really couldn't give a damn about.
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    Yeah, and I hated [Mild Season 1 spoiler](#s "the introduction of the main antagonist at the end").

    [](#s "Villainous group of Players forming a dictatorship in another country")?

    Awesome.

    [](#s "Main villain has obsessive romantic interest in the protagonist, who's already edging into Marty Stu territory")?

    Ugh.

    Hoping the second season really plays that down a bit.

      ```
      It's actually up in the air whether [Spoiler](#s "She actually has romantic interest in him, or she just realizes he is the lynchpin of Akiba, and is really, really good at manipulating people - particularly men.")
      ```

- u/injygo:
  ```
  What's 2YE?
  ```

  - u/Empiricist_or_not:
    ```
    [The Two Year Emperor](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9669819/64/The-Two-Year-Emperor) is a fanfic that posts every Saturday about a self insert character, coronated as absolute dictator of a D&D empire under attack; much munchkining ensues.  It publishes every Saturday, and it's author also has the thread about a kick starter for paid rationalist horror stories.
    ```

    - u/narfanator:
      ```
      To its definite credit, the subsequent Big Bad and the Unlikely Allie themselves had figured out many such munchkining techniques, independent of the self-insert character.

  okay I'm enjoying it but i have one major issue that just keeps bugging me. in the episode Shiroe stumbles and trips multiple times citing that his height is off. I thought that was a nice touch, then we get to a cat person who has the body control of a freakin acrobat.

  other than that though I've enjoyed it a lot.

  I mean... were you not expecting romance novel tropes? Because SAO is much more so a romance than a scifi or adventure story.

  - u/Drexer:
    ```
    I was not expecting the main female character being kept under threat of non-voluntary marriage and rape while unconscious to be used as the motivation for the main character.

    There's romance, and then there's disgusting tropes.
