## [BST] Perfect Recall*

### Post:

With a catch: you can remember perfectly every detail of one ten minute stretch of time that you've experienced. Everything outside of that is subject to regular memory mechanics. You can at no point change what memory you can perfectly recall. There are no clues present in the ten minutes prior to you obtaining this ability that would allow you to regain it through replicating the lead-up to the event. I have two scenarios in mind:

1) You are informed that you've gained this ability and must pick what stretch you'll remember immediately.

2) You are informed that you've gained this ability and are allowed to save it such that you can apply it to a stretch of time in the future after you've experienced it.

How do you use this power?

  We can pick up the Randi Prize with this, for one. ~24 fps * 600 s is ~15000 frames. I estimate 10 - 100 pages of text that a monitor setup can present per frame, making for ~1500 books of 100-1000 pages. Our marginal advantage is in accessing this information without the delay and bandwidth introduced by just accessing the smartphone we could instead.

  For all intents and purposes, you gave me a video camera with ten seconds of film. It's not particularly useful.

  Edit: Although I guess the fact that nobody else can see it can be useful. I use it to look at my private and public keys. Although I'd still need to type the private key somewhere to use it. I can't do math on that scale in my head.

    ...yes. It's kind of the equivalent of the 'superpower' of being handed a smartphone with an almost-dead battery. Which can't play games or run apps and is out of range of any signal.

    Technically it is video plus "smell-o-vision," taste, touch, etc...

    Which raises the point that a hedonist would probably go on an experience binge with the risk of becoming an addict reliving the same memory over and over, for whatever extremely pleasurable indulgence you have in mind.

    All said, I think that sadly, an "emotionalist" would find a better use for this ability than a rationalist, since perfect information recall doesn't amount to much in the free internet era.

      So get Heroin, nearly overdose, get Heroin-memory addicted without some of the bad sideeffects? 

      Though its debatable wether drug experiences fall under perfect memory.

  I'd note for the thread that being able to *remember* things is not the same as being able to *understand* them. Speedreading every scientific thesis paper for a particular area of science will not make you a scientist.

    No, but you can mentally reread them at your leisure.

  Congratulations, you've discovered the 1026^th least useful superpower.
