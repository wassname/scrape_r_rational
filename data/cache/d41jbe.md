  An interlude, showing, as always, actions have consequences.

  I always joke that VFL is a "let's make the villain the protagonist" fanfiction to a story that stars Cassius as the hero and focuses on vampire politics and munchkinry; and who knows, maybe someday I'll write the story from Cassius's point of view, but he as a character doesn't interest me, nor do his schemes that William and Red ultimately get embroiled in. Vampire politics is kind of a yawn for me, kind of done to death, but I still nonetheless love the worldbuilding-concept of it, and so I have used it liberally, but moreso as background (I'm currently reading Radiance, the sequel to luminosity, and am finding it very good still but would never care to write something so Vampire!Politics). 

  I like romance, I like people working together to beat the odds, and I like couples dealing with challenges. Also, I feel I should defend my characters' honour, and state that William, Elodia, or Cassius could be written as the protagonist or the main villain and the story would still work. Which, ultimately, is I think one of the requirements of rational fiction - antagonists with believable goals that work intelligently to achieve them. 

  That was a little philosophical, wasn't it?
