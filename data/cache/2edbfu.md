## [Q] Rational commute

### Post:

I have a pretty long commute to work and not much to do. Any suggestions to stuff I could listen to that is useful?

edit: Thanks, everyone :) A whole bunch of good podcasts here. Any audiobook suggestions, as brightwing requested?

  As already pointed out: If at all practical, move. Long commute times do a really horrible number on your quality of life. It is a cost people consistently underestimate very, very badly. - It is, for example, an extremely strong predictor of divorce. 

  Secondly: Are you driving? Because if so, pretty much anything actually useful is going to divert dangerous amounts of concentration from that, so I would suggest just going with music. 

  If it's a long train or bus ride, and you can't relocate due to causes like SO's job/school for kids, ect.. well, Language tapes, podcasts. An audible subscription is a pretty good deal.

    People always think I'm crazy when I tell them that the primary factor in where I live is proximity to work. When I do the math for them (~250*hours spent commuting per day). Even a half hour commute to work gives you more than enough time to watch every Simpsons episode ever made, including time for sleep, in less than a year.

  Dan Carlin's Hardcore History is amazing, and his Common Sense is good too. http://www.dancarlin.com/disp.php/hharchive

  I also enjoy The Skeptic's Guide to the Universe http://www.theskepticsguide.org/
  Planet Money http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/127413729/podcast/
  and the Savage Lovecast http://www.savagelovecast.com/

  Of course the most rational commute of all is the one where you drive less than 15 minutes cuz you live close to work. :) Except for the most extreme areas this is generally worth it, as the cost of gas/milage is not insignificant, and the cost in hours of your life is... hard to measure, but probably a LOT.

  Apart from podcasts any decent audiobooks guys? Doesn't have to be strictly rationalist - anything educational or science related be also good..

    A lot (all?) of the Iain M Bank's Culture Series is on audio book. Not rationalist, but some good AI stuff.
