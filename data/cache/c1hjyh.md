  This sub needs more posts so I hesitate to ask this... but can anyone explain why releases for this story get posted? It's one of the least rational books I've read.

    I disagree.  The style of the story is surrealist, but the core of it is pure rationality.  To borrow from the sidebar - It is 100% about intelligent characters solving problems through application of knowledge, examining goals and motivations, with intellectual pay-offs, and improving their meta-level thinking capabilities, in a fictional world with consistent rules (even if those rules are intentionally surrealist).  

    Conversations have characters with consistent mentalities, employing mental models of other characters.  One side will be lying about reality to the other and trying to make the other believe things, and while also revealing knowledge about themselves.  *In theory*, every well writter work is like this, but this is one of the few that truly requires it to have even a baseline understanding of what's going on.

      I think you hit it on the nose when you called it surrealist. Surrealism and rationalism seem antithetical to me.

      > It is 100% about intelligent characters solving problems through application of knowledge, examining goals and motivations, with intellectual pay-offs, and improving their meta-level thinking capabilities, in a fictional world with consistent rules (even if those rules are intentionally surrealist). 

      There has been a couple of intellectual payoffs (rules lawyering, mostly) but nothing that I would consider meaningful for the plot or for character development. Problems aren't being solved, as far as I can tell. (Or if they are being solved but I just I haven't been able to tell, that's also a problem.)

      You can't argue that the world has consistent rules when we don't have any actual knowledge of the magic system. If everything's up for grabs, then nothing's inconsistent.

      It would go a long way if the author made everything less mysterious... If we could actually see if someone's ideas are proven right or wrong, or if someone's plans succeed or fail. From a rational perspective, I want to see characters who act rationally – I can't see that if I don't know what they're thinking (Nic keeps hinting that he is doing things for reasons but we don't know what those reasons are, nor do his actions really make sense from what information we've been given. We also aren't inside any of the antagonists’ [if they are antagonists] heads.)

      I guess I am exaggerating somewhat. The first half of the first book did seem relatively rational, but since then it's hard to call a work rational if I have no idea what's going on, nor any idea why anyone is doing what they're doing.

        We seem to be halfway through finding out whats actually going on and what the different characters really want, though.

        * The High-Father wants humanity to destroy itself using the power he gave them

        * Nic, the being Nic met a few chapters ago, and Roke all want to stop him

        * Dizzy basically wants to be Atlas

        * Simole wants to live an enjoyable life whilst supporting Nic and Dizzy

        * The Gweur rebels want to overthrow the Ranvar hegemony and for some reason see Nic as the leader (probably related to the Librarian or Roke)

        * Fanny wants breakfast
        ```

- u/SatelliteFool:
  ```
  The protagonist is introspective, constantly questioning their own assumptions and knowledge. He's a three dimensional character, with emotions and flaws, yes, but he is fundamentally rational at heart.
