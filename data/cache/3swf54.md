  For those wondering as I did, HIT stands for Human Intelligence Task. The term comes from Amazon's Mechanical Turk.

  This story is about wire-heading AIs through 'shaping', a standard office job as drone-operator in the near-future, training the unit to do mundane tasks.

  Our protagonist spends most of the story rolling tables around in a hotel setting up for an event. Perhaps this is an intentional metaphor, because the majority of the action occurs on the mental/software level as he spends the initial part of the story decompressing the background and running diagnostics on his unit, as they set up for the main event.

  What's the event IRL? What's the event that takes place in the Mystery module?

  I can't wait to read more!
