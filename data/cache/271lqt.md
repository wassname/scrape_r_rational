      /u/mylittleeconomy literally has a whole account just devoted to his economics-with-ponies thing.

      And I spend only a fraction of my fiction-consumption budget on anything remotely pony related.

        What? It was only a joke! A passing reference! I read much more non-pony related stuff.

          Then *stop unleashing pony-shaped homogenizing swarms on things*.

              NO. HOMOGENIZING. SWARMS.

      Not /just/ you two. My recent writing binge was kickstarted by trying to write pony fiction. And I'm pretty sure that Yudkowsky coined the term 'transponyism' (not necessarily the first to do so) in one of his HPMOR fic recommendation notes, but can't seem to find it.

        I find the implications of this mildly to severely horrifying.

          I believe it would have been in reference to CelestAI from Friendship is Optimal. Which yes is horrifying on so many levels.

            Right.  The thing being, the woman in that story thought *she* was designing a *Friendly* AI.  Ended up unleashing a pony-shaped homogenizing swarm.
            ```

              Nah, she just thought that going with the not-quite-a-paperclipper was safer than waiting, in an environment where *she personally* slew an AI dedicated to making people suffer horribly and then die, and the underlying code was available and being built on by both the military and script-kiddies for various unsafe purposes.  

              If only she'd thought to implement the 'friendship and ponies' clause as a temporary instrumental value, to spread by making the game do well...
              ```

                The sad part is that this logic makes perfect sense when dealing with processes governed by entropic decay instead of entropic optimization.  When dealing with entropic optimization, you need to be damn sure to *get it right*.

                EDIT: Also, it occurs that this may have been what was meant when it turned out the Lone One had a purpose in the world after all.  Entropy turns out to be a far more sophisticated invention than death, when you look into the science of it.

  >The Infinite Loops, also known as the Innortal-style Time Loops, are an ever-expanding genre of Time Loop fanfics.

  >The premise is that something has happened to Yggdrasil, the World Tree computer that contains and runs the multiverse. As a result, the various universes have been put in 'safe mode', time-looping until Yggdrasil can be repaired. Each universe's loop is maintained by the presence of an Anchor, a core person from that loop who is the first to notice their universe is looping. There is always an Anchor in a Loop.

  It's just a massive collection of short stories. Great time sink, if you're into that sort of thing. Still managed to be fun even though it really shouldn't be able to be fun for that long. Don't expect hard sci-fi, or even anything too rational. Vaguely related to [fun theory](http://lesswrong.com/lw/xy/the_fun_theory_sequence/)?

  Some readers might compare Yggdrasil to the computers in permutation city. There's not a whole lot in overarching plot though.

    I've been sucked into these the past few weeks, they're surprisingly engaging.

  I am rather honoured to have been recommended.

  W.R.T. suspense, the setup for the MLP Loops with regard to that can pretty much be expressed twofold.
  1) Most of the time, it's kind of cracky and the lack of effective opposition doesn't matter so much. Apparently defeating a cosmic evil by bribing her with ice cream, say.
  2) When there is a serious threat of some kind... well, I quote the expert, Rincewind, on the occasion he was given a virtual-reality suit.
  "What does not kill you can give you a really big headache."
  A threat doesn't have to be existential to be a challenge, IOW.

  Anyway. Glad to see people like the fic.

    Well there's [this](http://archiveofourown.org/works/1113651), which is short.

    Someone should go through [this](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanficRecs/HarryPotterPeggySue) index.

      Fundamentally, Harry Potter's canon plots is part of that group of stories where if you know the ending and who the villain is and what their plan is, it has very little capacity to threaten you - year 1 knowing Quirrel and the mirror and the puzzle rooms, year 2 knowing about the chamber and it's details, etc. Most of them are not difficult because of lack of power of people on the protagonists' side, but because of lack of knowledge. So giving them that foreknowledge puts them squarely into the problem of "Frodo just got a lightsaber, where's Sauron's Death Star?" as paraphrased from something Yudkowsky wrote somewhere. There's lots of time travel fics with reasonably OK writing - it's usually the absence of tension in the plots that kills them, more than anything else. If you're trying to sell me on a dramatic confrontation between good and evil, it is vitally important that this confrontation have meaningful results if the protagonist loses, rather than retrying infinite times without penalty - if they just keep retrying, it basically ends up as the viewer watching someone play a videogame they are not good at, and, well...

      > ... One simple truth, one that even a little kid should know... "There’s nothing more boring than watching someone else play a game"

      ^^^^bonus ^^^^points ^^^^if ^^^^you ^^^^know ^^^^where ^^^^this ^^^^quote ^^^^came ^^^^from!)

      Even just having foreknowledge without repeatable timetravel loops is enough to wreck many stories with only canon opposition, to be honest.

      There are multiple fics which found solutions to this problem:

      - [Time Braid](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644/1/Time-Braid) (Naruto) made there be antagonists with the same looping power as the protagonists and the ability to affect people across loops via mind-control abilities, which are both demonstrated fairly on in the story, which maintains power levels and tension.

      - [Oh God Not Again](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4536005/1/Oh-God-Not-Again) (HP) and [It's For A Good Cause, I Swear!](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5409165/1/It-s-For-a-Good-Cause-I-Swear) (Naruto) both by Sarah1281, take the approach of making absurdity and humor the focus of the fic, over conflict with canon antagonists. 

      - [Harry Potter and the Wasteland of Time](http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4068153/1/Harry_Potter_and_the_Wastelands_of_Time) (HP) takes the approach of increasing canon antagonist skill/power by a huge amount and also by introducing nonlooping opposition.

      - [Sisyphus](http://archiveofourown.org/works/1113651) (HP) makes looping ennui itself the enemy rather than a canon antagonist.

      - [New Game Plus](http://soulriders.net/brian/fanfic/ngp/) (Haruhi, oneshot) is a straight comedy that doesn't rely on tension to hold together the story. 

      - [Back Again](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8942429/1/) (LOTR) has Bilbo losing allies and doing fighting non-canonical challenges a lot.

      - [Groundhog Day](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3248583/1/) (HP) is basically just straight crack/comedy, as is [Reunion](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4655545/1/Reunion) by the same author.

      There are a lot of looping timetravel stories which are technically reasonably OK on the writing side, but lack all tension because there hasn't been a presented way for the protagonists with time travel abilities to possibly lose in any sort of serious or permanent way. 

      For example, [Harry Potter and the Temporal Beacon](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6517567/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Temporal-Beacon) has bad stuff happen occasionally, but nothing ever permanently affecting or persistent through loops - so there is no real question that eventually through sheer perseverance and luck they will win through (or would have, if the fic wasn't deader than a doornail). I guess maybe the H/Hr romance subplot is supposed to be a reader's interest, maybe, but that plot is so slowly developing that it's almost unreal.

      [Naruto: Ramen Days](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7820743/1/Naruto-Ramen-Days) (Naruto) loses a lot of dramatic power because of absence of meaningful ability to lose at anything, but there seems to be some developing antagonism/etc between new looping people which may lead to actual meaningful conflict eventually so I'm not going to write it off wholly just yet (mostly because the author's written other good stuff, than because I necessarily think the fic as-is is showing it's going to redeem itself strongly)

          To be fair to the original author, that quote was about what was effectively MMO gameplay.

          While I will conceded that there are entertaining Let's Plays, they are almost invariably done by someone who knows the game and is experienced enough at it that they are not meaningfully challenged by it and repeating the same segment over and over trying to progress, or have at the least edited such attempts out. I have seen blind LP's of games which are difficult unedited and with frequent retrying the same segments, and I almost always abandon them. It's not a universal truth that is perfectly true in all circumstances, though - even blind LP's with much repetition can be [entertaining](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ua6pbz3ROvQ)

        There is a sequel to Wastelands of Time, Heartlands of Time, but the author hasn't updated it since late 2012. :(

  ```
  I follow the MLP loops avidly and would say they're among my favourites, certainly for crackfic, even though I watch no anime so half of the jokes and references pass me by ("just what is meant to be so bad about Eiken, anyway?").
  ```

  - u/traverseda:
    ```
    It's just... not good. It was removed from tvtropes for not having enough plot to justify a page.

    Now after reading that, I want you to understand that that is one of the most merciful reviews one could possibly make of it.
