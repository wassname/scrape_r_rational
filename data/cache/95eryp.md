## Which Rational Work Taught you the most about thinking?

### Post:

HPMOR taught me how to lie better, influence others, and think more scientifically.

Luminosity showed me why those first two are not always good skills to have.

The Arithmancer demonstrated the effectiveness and dangers of hard work, being part of a team, and skill transference.

Which books (rational or otherwise) have influenced the way you think the most?

  If by that you mean fiction, the story that I *noticed* teaching me things was van Vogt's Null-A.  I expect that stories like Asimov's Foundation taught me quiet ideas like "You can analyze things by thinking", and that Piper's Fuzzy stories taught me to take for granted that sapience mattered, etcetera.
  ```

  - u/wren42:
    ```
    I agree on Foundation, I suspect it's also the source of a lot of my emotional optimism and hope that rationality can lead to a better future.  The idea that a group of social scientists can work to tweak society's long term direction and create a more sustainable civilization is perhaps far fetched but it still resonates with me.

  Ender's Game book 2, The Speaker for the Dead. It made me really think about how something perfectly normal for one group can be completely horrifying for another. The whole book is about putting aside your own worldview and trying to see events from another person's perspective, because in a way, each person lives inside their own version of reality. And we can't really know another person until we accept that their truth is **a real** truth.

    Yes, this was a super formative work for my tween self. HPMOR reinforced it, in a way; I think all the time about the scene where Harry defends Draco to Hermione with the kids-burning-cats example.
    ```

    - u/Cuz_Im_TFK:
      ```
      I only vaguely remember the burning cats example, but do remember the part where it says something like: Draco Malfoy is *exactly* what you'd expect an eleven year old kid to be like if his doting father was Darth Vader.

          Ah, that's the one. I agree, it's really fun seeing an "innocently evil" character.

    I'm assuming that you *have* read Three Worlds Collide, yes?

    If not, you should do that now. It's only short.

  I think definitely Luminosity. I apply the whole "don't lie to yourself about your true reasons for doing things just to maintain the belief that you're a good person" thing practically daily. Also, saying things out loud to remember them rather than just saying them in my head. That comes up less but is also pretty handy (ie. counting out scoops of coffee)
  ```

  For me the top 3 that shaped the way I think are ring world series by Larry Niven, ender saga by Card Orson Scott and basically everything from Asimov. But I would argue that everything you read changes a bit the way you think or atleast the way you look at the world. The more points of view you are exposed to the more you learn not to take things at face value and you grow as a person. I can say that sometimes I learned more from 1 paragraph I read on a random comment on Reddit then some entire books I read.
  ```

- u/masasin:
  ```
  Pokemon: The Origin of Species basically has tutorials on hacking your brain (e.g., goal factoring, murphyjitsu, etc). The author also explains emotions as the physical sensations and attaches them to words, which helps me a lot (alexithymia).
  ```

- u/thrawnca:
  ```
  I'm gonna say HPMoR, with nuggets like "why do I believe what I believe?" and "if you're surprised, either your information is wrong or your model of reality is wrong."
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Fun fact, I used an idea from that in a very religious school in the South.  The asked if I believed in evolution.  I took a brief digression how the phrase do you believe gets virtue signaling as a response and how "is \_\_\_\_ real" is a better way of testing your beliefs.  A kid goes "is God real?" and then clapped his hands over his mouth; it was one of the more heartbreaking and hilarious moments in teaching.
    ```

    - u/thrawnca:
      ```
      Hmm... Not sure where the heartbreaking part comes from? It's a perfectly reasonable question to ask IMO, whether your answer is "yes" (Christian school) or "no" (much of the Western population) or "watch this space" (HJPEV).

      Thanks for the anecdote.
      ```

      - u/flipflopchip:
        ```
        Well for me it's the fact that the kid did ask a reasonable question and then was embarrassed enough to put his hands to his mouth.

        Even if the emotion wasn't exactly embarrassment, it's sad that a good question like that warrants any emotional response other than increased curiosity.

  Surprisingly the inheritance cycle. While it's a fairly irrational farm boy to hero story, the magic system is incredibly ripe for munchkining, in fact that's basically what determines how powerful a magic user is, how good they are at abusing the vocabulary and grammar they know.
  It completely shifted the way I viewed magic in books.
  ```

  - u/zeldn:
    ```
    Agreed, it’s one of those few instances where the magic genuinely feels like an actual skill that you can appreciate and understand the difficulty of. Simply defined magic system with lots of complexity.
    ```

    - u/Iwasahipsterbefore:
      ```
      Yup, someone who knows three words could easily trounce someone with an entire dictionary at their disposal, either through creativity or scientific knowledge. One particularly rational example from the story is just applying a small amount of force directly in the brain. The story explored consequences of the magic in cool ways, such as having mages sprinkled throughout the army and having a secondary fight going on underneath the obvious one.

      Other parts were annoyingly irrational, such as the dragon dance, and the ending (not going to say why because spoilers); but on the whole it was extremely well done.
      ```

  - u/darkardengeno:
    ```
    Also, it's been a really long time since I've read it but if I remember correctly _Eldest_ was damn near rationalist. I didn't realize it when I read it, but the elves are basically a transhumanist utopia, beings who used magic to become immortal and end scarcity and they spend all their time working on self-improvement or understanding the world better. Most of Eragon's lessons seem not far removed from modern rationality.
    ```

    - u/Iwasahipsterbefore:
      ```
      Thinking back on it, yeah. There was an entire subplot about Eragon struggling to move past his superstitutions and embrace logic and rhetoric.
      ```

      - u/CopperZirconium:
        ```
        That subplot really spoke to me. Eragon learning not-quite-science from the elves and then inspecting his own cultural beliefs and observing the dwarves’ religion.
        ```

  - u/The_Flying_Stoat:
    ```
    So when are we getting an Inheritance ratfic? It sounds like a world where a rational character would really shine.
    ```

- u/Sailor_Vulcan:
  ```
  If we're just talking about fiction, probably HPMOR. If we're talking about rational literature in general, probably Rationality: From AI to Zombies/the Sequences on Lesswrong.

  Or wait are we talking about learning how to think or learning how thinking works?

  (I bet there are a ton of people on here with that exact same answer to your question who aren't posting on this thread because they don't have anything new, unique or surprising to add to this discussion that isn't already said. Most people here got started from HPMOR after all.

- u/throwaway11252016:
  ```
  It's hard for me to think of a book that taught me about thinking before I found rational fiction. I read a lot of Heinlein growing up, which exposed me to new ideas that were healthy for me to think about it. A lot of it is pulpy though, arguably smut (maybe that's why I read him so much). Here is a recommendation you might not have seen before: Moonwalking with Einstein. I think it was a great primer on using mnemonics. It isn't fictional, but it's at least shaped into a narrative.

  As others have listed, HPMOR, Ender's Game, were influential for me too.  Ender's game helped me develop empathy as a young adult.  HPMOR had a lot of metacognition theory which was useful.  Reddit's badHistory is a great place to see biases on display, and the value of academic debate; I was lucky enough to start reading it in college which helped me focus on learning as a process and outcome of debate.  Dune was also influential, because along with Foundation, it helped me worked out the ideas of History and Politics as a system with something close to universal laws.  It was an Enlightenment for me.

  Perhaps unsurprisingly, I'm a teacher and none of the classwork I did really focused on metacognition.  Most of the stuff I could find online was written way above the reading level of my students or was just a way to try to sell the same old tired strategies.  The Less Wrong post on education was profoundly unhelpful too, because it presented problems without solutions and the comments were the usual mixture of hatred for public schools as social engineering (that's supposed to be a bad thing to transhumanists?) and resurfacing of old trauma visited on students by their teachers.

      I try different things, but I'm probably teaching a very different group of kids.  I didn't join the discussion because I believe the article is years old.  I'll look for the article.  Long story short, teaching rationality is hard and mostly unsuccessful, so I try different things each year.  Frequently I fall afoul of [Goodhart's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law).  Different things I try include:

      1. Graph this population data and give me reasonable guesses of what you think is happening.  This is moderately successful, but takes an inordinate amount of time with my population.  30 minutes to manually make a line graph with 10 data points.  The reason I have them do it manually is I that I want them to screw up and see how data distorts if you mess up your scale.  Teaching map/graph scale / ratios is challenging problem / one of our mandated responsibilities.
      2. Let's look at two pictures.  First tell me what you notice.  Then tell me what you notice here.  How are these two things different?  What are some guesses you have as to why?  How can you prove your guess?  This works ok.  It's better for creating visual associations to content than it is for teaching visual reasoning.  Example:  Picture of the Korean peninsula at night from space, what is the difference between the two areas?  Why are they different?  Let's read an article to find out.  The opening steps work wonderfully, but kids have trouble justifying their guesses even when right.
      3. I do one debate, and only after we've read 5 pages of primary sources and they've written a paper where I hammer their logic in the comments.  We're talking a page and a half of comments for half a page of writing; for a hundred students.  This is by far the most effective exercise I do, but it takes 2 weeks of class time, 3 weeks of grading, and another 2 weeks of recovery.  Upper level students like the feed back and argumentation; lower level students dislike the independence.  This shows positive results for the top 30% of students.  An unknown but sizeable portion get their parents to do it for them, and then their parents get mad when I call out their faulty logic.
      4. Here's a bunch of different explanations for why something happened.  Read it, answer associated questions, tell me why or why not it's a convincing argument, move around the room asking other groups, and tell me what the most convincing argument was.  This has worked surprisingly poorly for me.  Most students have trouble comprehending different arguments simultaneously.
      5. Find all the examples of this historical author mentioning this phrase in the text.  Why does he use this phrase?  No, it's not because he's stupid.  He has a purpose.  What do you think it is based on the way he's using it?  This is effective only for about the top 5% of students.  
      6. Cause and effect mapping an event.  This is extremely ineffective at teaching content or comprehension.  I'm not sure why, but I think the medium is creating anxiety.
      7. Teaching that the world is a network of systems.  I do this through showing maps, surprising facts.  I'm not sure if it's effective.

      If you're still reading at this point. You'll notice the major flaw in all these techniques.  They're techniques that are not goal-oriented.    Rationality is a hard concept to define (even though there's the whole point about most definitions being probabilistic clusters.)  I would say that beyond the whole History thing, I want to help my students develop the following mental processes:

      1.  The ability to examine their beliefs, and change their beliefs as new evidence comes in.
      2. The desire to always prove arguments and base their arguments on evidence.
      3. The ability to notice when they're confused and figure out why they're confused.

      I don't know how the fuck you teach this or how the fuck you measure whether your different strategies are successful, especially #3.  I would appreciate help, but I think making a post would be a little gauche since I've not been an member of this community very long.

  I feel like I learned a lot about human nature from *Gulliver's Travels*, though I read it pretty young. I also feel like fiction in general has made me value honesty highly.

  HPMOR taught me rationality wasn't all it appeared to be. I read everything on lesswrong, and was really starting to fall for it.

  Then just after i read something about rationality being the thing that wins, I finished the book. The ending disappointed me, all the plot hooks that were promised failed to come to a conclusion, and the thought that was supposed to be put in the story appeared to be empty promises. 

  That showed me, thinking rational isn't going to make you a good writer. Or a good talker. Or good at understanding other poeple. Most of the important stuff in society is cultural, and lives in the minds of poeple. And poeple are not rational.

  Malazan. Despite a lot of people who might say that I'm all "BULLSHIT!", it was one of the most rational series I knew, when I read it.  


  Malazan. There were reasons for everything that happened, and it was explained in world, no outside the world. Just like Glen Cook's stories later on. There's a need to be rational in their stories, and I really love it. If a character does so and so, it's because of a roll of the dice, and that's all you get

  Hmm. Interesting question. It wasn't a rational story, but I did read one manwha that helped me learn a coping strategy for a really hard period I was going through. The story was called Nineteen, Twenty-one. It was about a girl who went into a coma, came out after a year, and had to retake her last year of high school. She was essentially nineteen (twenty-one in Korean age) and taking cram school with juvenile delinquents.

  She was depressed and felt like she was always behind, like she'd never catch up with the rest of the world. I also started college two years late, and felt awful about it for similar reasons.

  At the end of the story, the girl says, "I don't want to go through life thinking I'm always two steps behind. If things hadn't worked out that way, I wouldn't be the person I am now. There are things more important in life than the difference in age between nineteen and twenty-one."

  Sometimes we can focus on the wrong things in life like they're a big deal. I often thought about that story after reading it, and I think it really encouraged me to see setbacks in a more realistic and positive perspective. Not just in that situation, but in others as well.

  I'm not sure if this counts as learning to think more rationally, but it helped me to act more rational and level headed in stressful situations. I read it years ago, but it still resonates with me. :)
