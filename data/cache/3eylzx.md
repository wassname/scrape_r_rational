## [RT][FF] "The World Is Your Oyster, The Universe Is Your Namesake" has updated... Again.

### Post:

Steven Universe fanfic by yours truly. Steven starts asking questions and using available magical devices to full effect.

Hard-ish Science-Fantasy, Soft-munchkin, and very character-driven.

Now with *12 additional chapters*, and almost 40K words, because I am a very fast writer with nothing to do.

[First Chapter](http://archiveofourown.org/works/3808279/chapters/8485900)

[Update Begins Here](http://archiveofourown.org/works/3808279/chapters/10100393)

  You are a cliffhanger-leaving, chapter-spewing machine!

  And relationship drama! Whoo!!!

  Great story so far.

  _Every me is fully me. Every me is fully me._

  Hah! My mantra is shorter! :D

  [edit] Site is down again. :(

  [edit] Site went back up! And cliffhanger :(

    The problem is that the Clones are impermanent, and qualitatively different.

    And your bitter tears of hanging on my cliffs only makes me stronger. :P

  /r/Homestuck wants me to watch this show.

  /r/anime wants me to watch this show.

  Does /r/rational want me to watch this show now?

  Fine, dammit. I'll watch the show.

    Have fun. You can catch all the goodies at [The World of Steven Universe](http://theworldofstevenuniverse.blogspot.com) (click the "Episodes (English)" drop-down menu at the top, then "SU (season 1)" and the rest should be obvious. Make sure to have an adblocker.)

    Yes. Watch. Now. It's amazing. Rebecca Sugar is an Elizer level god of creation.
    ```
