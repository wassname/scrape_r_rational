  Back to the main serial after a long bout of rewrite/re-edit-itis.  The description of Doc's helmet is a bit of bonus horror for readers familiar with control theory, and can be safely read as techno-babble by everyone else.
    Since it's been so long since the last regular chapter, I included a link in the intro to the last chapter on Earth (Chapter 43), for those who want to refresh their memories.  Enjoy!

  I'd like to read more about how starships flirt with each other.

    I have starting material for least three short stories, a probable novella, and a couple of sub-plot seeds for the next book just in the material I ended up cutting from this chapter because, although cool, it did not advance the plot enough.  But you will probably eventually get to see some of Learning's interactions with the Primly Certain (one of the ships still in Earth orbit) and a bit about the Grs'thnk philosophy for warship AIs (They really, really want to avoid anything that might want to become a Berserker or deathbot.)

  100% minor typo, but it looks like one of the hazard alert notice IDs is missing a value:

  >     	Subsystem hazard alert notice 008153867929:  Action–defer.
  >     	Subsystem maintenance alert notice 0081538627930:  Action–defer.

  The first has one less digit than all of the others, looks like it should be 00815386**2**7929 rather than 008153867929
