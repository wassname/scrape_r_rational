## [D] Friday Open Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.

  Let's say you realized there is an infohazard *already in the wild* and *very common* that would be lethal/extremely dangerous to a very small group of people in a *very specific* circumstance. Would it be okay to talk about that online?
  ```

    This already exists, in a certain sense. Photosensitive epileptic individuals can be sent into seizures if they view flashing lights, such as what may be displayed on a television screen/monitor. The Porygon episode of the Pokemon anime (season 1 episode 38) is a famous example of this.

    Looking at the real-world example, we can observe that adding strobing lights to videos is widely avoided for this reason. Translating that to your hypothetical infohazard, it should probably be treated similarly.

    Sounds like suicide. Suicide rates skyrocket after someone famous suffers from it.

    It is probabalistic though, where a person's risk of suicide increases rather than being guaranteed like fictional infohazards tend to be.

    Also only really applies to at risk populations. People with suicidal tendencies and/or depression.

    Look at how rational minds argue we should treat suicide in the press.
    ```

    - u/awesomeideas:
      ```
      Just to be clear, this is not suicide. The recipient need do nothing at all except pay attention to the message. But good points.
      ```

  - u/anenymouse:
    ```
    I think to a certain point it makes sense to both explain what it is and why it is an infohazard. Like in comparison there's been a relatively recent trend of explaining how say fireworks can trigger the PTSD of a previous service man, or that a certain percentage of people are more likely to kill themselves, and others incidentally, from the news of people dying in car crashes or as CosmicPotatoe said suicide. 

    If it has already breached containment then having the information to ameliorate its effects should be put out and made as available if not more available than the infohazard itself.
    ```

  - u/gtsteel:

    Can the situation be warned (i.e in the initially visible part of a spoiler tag) without spreading the hazard?

  Someone recently asked about 'big wins' of statistics in r/slatestarcodex, long story short these two links - [one](http://www.sustainable.soltechdesigns.com/Feynman-Uncertainty.pdf) [two](https://library.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/ft/gg/GG_Mindless_2004.pdf) \- have made for interesting reading. Got me wondering why stats isn't taught more symbolically in the first place, i.e. start with P(data | hypothesis) and *then* give it context in the form of a soliloquy, rather than the other way around.

  Now that I'm older I have noticed that my body doesn't heal as fast as it used to. Particularly after a long night working. Where I used to wake up the next day like nothing happened, now I wake up feeling like I got hit by a truck and my head is full of fog. Coffee no longer helps me as well either.

  And so as I'm pondering about aging, wonder. What exercises could be used to maintain the brain in old age?

  I think the main issues are slower processing so I'm thinking maybe tetris? Here's where I'm lacking ideas.

  And for memory the good ol' enough rest hours, reading books and memory exercises.

  Have you ever thought of ways to slow down the inevitable?
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    I think taking the right supplements is more likely to help with the symptoms of aging than any mental exercise. I mean, it's a good idea to stay mentally active, but presumably by working and dealing with life's everyday problems you're already doing that.

    I've recently been looking into molecules that are produced by the human body but tend to be produced less and less as we age. Insufficient quantities of some of these are suspected to be responsible for a host of diseases associated with old age, or even with 'normal' senescence.

    The most important one that came up is [glutathione](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione), probably the most essential antioxidant and cell detoxifier. Unfortunately taken as an oral supplement it mostly gets destroyed in the stomach and gut, so it's recommended to take NAC (N-acetyl-cysteine), the main precursor of glutathione, instead. There's also sublingual glutathione which goes directly into the blood stream, though it's much more expensive.

    Two other, less important anti-oxidants which I also take are [alpha-lipoic acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipoic_acid) and [coenzyme Q10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coenzyme_Q10).

    Other things that might help: Reducing the amount of carbs you eat, cutting down on processed foods as much as possible, intermittent fasting, a bit of cardio every day. Taking enough vitamin D supplements to reach a blood level between [40 and 80 ng/mL](https://www.vitamindcouncil.org/about-vitamin-d/testing-for-vitamin-d/#.XXLGHihKiUk) (by the way, if you take more than 5k IU of vitamin D daily, also take the recommended daily dose of vitamin K2 to avoid any risk of calcification).  Having your DNA analyzed at [23andme.com](https://23andme.com) and sending the raw data to  [mygenefood.com](https://mygenefood.com) for information on which foods you might be better off avoiding (usually this turns out to be the most commonly inflammatory foods such as dairy products and gluten).

    Good luck!

    &#x200B;

    **Edited two months later, in case anyone is reading this post**: I have stopped taking glutathione and alpha lipoic acid on a daily basis. I now only take them occasionally when I feel the need. My concern is that taking glutathione might induce the body to produce less of it. Also, glutathione is a heavy metal chelator, and I'm fairly certain that it made me zinc deficient after taking 300mg every day for 6 weeks. Alpha lipoic acid is... probably safe, but it's also a heavy metal chelator, and I'd rather not take any risks.

    I still take NAC (200 mg per day), CoQ 10 (100mg per day), vitamin D, and vitamin K2. I've also begun taking 250mg/day nicotinamide riboside (as the Niagen brand) for its anti-aging effects, along with TMG, vitamins B6, B9, and B12, as well as 400 mg resveratrol per day (to prevent possible negative side effects from Niagen). And I should mention I've been taking 400 mg Longvida curcumin extract and 2g good quality fish oil (from Nordic Naturals) daily for a while now.

    One last thing: Instead of the rather expensive, and not all that useful genetic report produced by [mygenefood.com](https://mygenefood.com), I strongly recommend Dr. Rhonda Patrick's report for a mere $10:

    You might want to see a doctor. If you wake up not feeling refreshed it's possible you have sleep apnea or something. Sleep apnea can also affect memory. Also, you might want to not drink any coffee in the afternoon or evening since it can interfere with sleep. And other basic sleep hygiene type stuff like not eating chocolate before bed, not using the bed for anything other than sleep and sex, waking up at the same time every morning, setting up blue light filter apps on your phone and computer, and using a lightbox in the morning.

      >even if you and I have been in heated arguments.

      That feels aimed at me :P How many people have you been in heated arguments with in this subreddit?

      Anyway, I might take you up on that.

      If you can afford it, going to a gym that does classes is a *great* help. 

      Not just because there'll be a trainer who can teach you to do the movements properly, but because having a bunch of people who expect you to be at the class provides a great deal of societal pressure to actually, you know, go. 

      It can also have a lot of knock-on effects, particularly in terms of networking; someone who's spotted you at the gym is probably willing to refer you for a job you're interested in. 

      The problem is that the gyms with the *good* classes tend to be expensive, particularly if you're looking for the sort of inclusive and non-judgemental gym that introverted nerdfaces who browse subreddits like /r/rational would do better in.

      The other thing that really helps is working cardio into your routines; instead of driving, why not walk or ride a bike? If everything's too far for biking, consider getting an e-bike. You can go a *lot* further on one of those, and the cardio's just as good. They also really help you get over the "but it's gonna suck on the way home" hump.  

      But again, e-bikes (and bicycles that are nice to ride in general) are expensive.

      Basically, if you wanna live forever, the first step is to not be poor.
      ```

      - u/sicutumbo:
        ```
        Biking or walking places sounds extremely nice for places that don't regularly hit 100 degree on the heat index, or for places who consider pedestrians better than second class citizens.

        I think the time and effort investment is greater than the monetary investment. Gyms can be like $10 a month if you aren't doing classes, and even the nice ones aren't all that much more than that. Eating well isn't super expensive either, beans are great for you and cheap, and eggs are tasty, useful, and healthy. But the time to go to the gym regularly, the time to cook meals instead of eating stuff you can shove in a microwave, and the effort to do the above, those are the real kickers. Especially when you just suck at exercising or cooking, it's hard to make the initial investment. I don't have any hard numbers, but I imagine quite a lot of people go to the gym for like 2 weeks, get hit with the awful soreness, don't see enough results for the pain, and stop going.

            >They probably try to go too hard too fast, or ramp up too quick. If you've never gone to the gym and immediately jump into some ish, that's gonna hurt.

            That's kind of what I mean when I say people being bad at exercising. A lot of people have this perception of "working out" being this hours long thing, multiple times a week. One guy I introduced to the gym was amazed that you could get significant results with 3 hours a week of working out (3 1-hour sessions). Granted, you'll get better results if you do cardio as well and various other things, but you can get to the level of people asking if you work out with just a few hours a week.

            The idea of studying the science of picking things up and then setting them down is foreign for most people.

            >The trick is to begin cooking an eff-ton of eggs as soon as you roll out of bed.

            Breakfast isn't so bad, but for lunch and especially dinner you probably want something more varied than eggs.  And learning how to make good food, or even just making good eggs, can be an investment of time that some people don't want to make.

  What would a substance that tends to *lose* entropy look like (if we're talking about a hard fantasy universe, so we can make new rules of physics ad hoc)? Does such a substance even make sense? If so, then what could some of its properties be? I'm fine with dropping off more precise models of physics (eg. ignoring quantum mechanics) if those models entirely preclude the concept from occurring.
  ```

  - u/eniteris:
    ```
    Well, when I think of losing entropy I think of self-organizing structures, like crystals. Crystals are lower-entropy than their dissolved state, but you need to put in energy to evaporate the solvent, which leads to higher entropy everywhere else.

    So for some fantasy universe, I'd have some crystals that have the ability to reform when shattered, and the eerie ability to slowly move towards other crystals. So sort of like the Iron Giant.

    At least that's how I think it works.

    Alternately, you can just have some fixed-temperature substance. That always messes everything up.

    Ice-9.
    Or in a fantasy world, naturally forming mana-crystals. Maybe. 
    In some fantasies, the most powerful cultivators, magicians, or whatnot seem to be anti-entropy, or resistant to the idea of entropy, when they have some sort of infinitely generating well of energy or naturally "absorb" energy in a way that is self-sustaining.
    ```

    - u/traverseda:
      ```
      Eh, ice-9 looks like a jump to a different, lower energy, local maxima. Like a false vacuum collapse.
      ```

      - u/pldl:
        ```
        It should release enormous amounts of heat or energy, then. As described, it doesn't do that, it just causes water to solidify instantly, which means the energy should be somehow stored within the structure of ice-9.

    The books are better. *Exo* in particular features a lot of science and engineering that I think would appeal to this subreddit. The writing is still a little YA for my tastes, but it scratches the itch as far as powers exploration/exploitation goes.

    Exo spoilers: >!Much of the plot of the fourth book is taken up with Cent starting a one-teenage-girl space agency that can teleport up into LEO and deorbit debris, place microsats, or inspect satellites for damage. One of the early chapters has her getting a call from the sat phone company, which is quite puzzled by the glitch in their system that indicates that she's moving at seven thousand miles per hour. I had a huge grin on my face reading that.!<

  A question for anyone interested in the stock market: Is there an expert that you trust to have a good enough understanding of economics and a good enough read on current politics to make (probably) accurate predictions about the stock market? Someone rational and well-informed, with an above average track record.

  *Edited to add*: Or if you have your own predictions please feel free to post them there, I'd love to read them!
  ```

  - u/Nivirce:
    ```
    Isn't stocks basically *dominated* by Black Swan events, that render most predictions pointless, though? I don't really have anyone who I trust very much on the subject, except perhaps Nassim Taleb. Though I'm also open to suggestions on that front.
    ```

    - u/Rhamni:
      ```
      Individual stocks are, certainly. Sometimes whole industries. But the more you zoom out and bet on index funds, the less of an issue black swans are, especially if you invest globally. Sure, exact timing is still hard to predict, but the fact that Warren Buffet and people like him are holding a higher proportion of cash than he has since 2008 is a strong indicator that the most successful billionaire investors are expecting the stock market as a whole to go *down* in the next year or three.
      ```

  - u/CosmicPotatoe:
    ```
    The predictive power of the science of economics is very limited in a short time frame.

    You are asking for a level of accuracy that does not exist in the feild. 

    Hence why index funds beat managed funds.
    ```

  - u/sl236:
    ```
    Index-linked funds outperform all other forms of investment in the long term.
    ```

    - u/IICVX:
      ```
      Funnily enough, the guy who predicted the CDO bubble is now saying that [he thinks there's an index-linked fund bubble.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-04/michael-burry-explains-why-index-funds-are-like-subprime-cdos)

      People are getting into a lot of fights about it, but I think his argument makes sense - it's more like a mathematical existence proof than anything else, so it's super philosophical.

      The basic idea is that there's not actually a ton of volume in the indexes. He's saying that 250 stocks with less than $450 million in trade volume (the bottom end of the S&P 500) do not have sufficiently accurate prices for us to be pinning billions of dollars in index-backed funds to them.

      It's a neat argument and I think it makes sense, but the problem is that it's got like zero predictive utility. Pretty much the only thing I take from it is that maybe we should invest in total market or small cap ETFs.

  Hello all!

  I've recorded [Chapters 1&2](https://storiesbysky.podbean.com/) of the Seventh Tower Book One.

  I'd love some more feedback on it.

  I've tried adding more cadences and tones to my recording. The primary concern I got from the prologue was that it felt too much like I was just reading it flat off the book. 

  I also attempted to do more character voices, although I feel like I might have messed up Tal's voice at the end of chapter 2.

  Furthermore something is off with the pace of chapter two but my own bias is stopping me from identifying or putting it into words properly, so sorry about that.
