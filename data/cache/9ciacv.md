  I was wondering why Cordelia sounded surprised in her viewpoint chapter if she already knew about the Dead King, but re-reading it, I realize she wasn't surprised, just really tense. The reason she sounded desperate was that, for a moment, she thought Catherine had intelligence on the Dead King and might give it to her.
  ```

  - u/FeluriansCloak:
    ```
    My impression was that she didn’t know about the dead king per se, just the somewhat vague prophecy from Agnes. Then when Cat told her, it clicked into place.
    ```

  ```
  Ah, sweet, sweet worldbuilding.

  Also I was laughing my ass off as each one of Cordelia's counters was met with a swift end.
  ```

  ```
  > “I am told this is to be a closed session,” Brother Simon said. “By the request of a Chosen.”

  Is it bad that I only now notice that Grey Pilgrim didn't actually *promise* at any point to help in making peace with the Grand Alliance and to assist Callow in turning against the Dread Empire? Catherine thought a redemption plot was implied, but we know that 
  in a given story Creation doesn't go for the same plot twice, and that *Akua* is the one going for redemption now.

  Did anyone pay attention to the timetable? I want to understand when Tariq must have called together the conclave: ather negotiations in chapter 8, after the ones in the wake of Battle of Camps (whenh he effectively threw Cordelia under the bus), or after she came to him when the Dead King invited her?

    Why are you assuming that GP is the Chosen?  It can't be him unless he can be in two places at once.  But you know who can always be at the right place at the right time?  The Wandering Bard.
    ```

    - u/Zayits:
      ```
      He was told (by the angels, presumably) about the details of Catherine's encounter with the Stalwart Paladin. He could have used the same way to contact the priests.

      Edit: The main reason I consider this to be a possibility is because the priests seem to have organized it through some channel Cordelia managed to pass up, and the only Named who displayed anything close to that kind of means of communication before is Grey Pilgrim.
      ```

      - u/melmonella:
        ```
        What, bard's teleportation not good enough for you? She could have appeared in front of the three disparage factions of priests and told them what to do.
        ```

- u/GeeJo:
  ```
  Fatalism, not Fatality, fwiw.
  ```

- u/CeruleanTresses:
  ```
  Am I right in thinking this chapter implies that Brother Simon is a trans man? It's been a good week for LGBT+ representation.
  ```

  - u/ATRDCI:
    ```
    FWIW, the Tyrant's head general is a trans woman.
    ```

    - u/CeruleanTresses:
      ```
      Oh nice, I either missed that or forgot about it so I'm glad you reminded me. I love that explicitly LGBT+ characters can exist in this setting without it being a whole controversy.
      ```

      - u/ATRDCI:
        ```
        I mean, it's not extremely explicit. Just pretty much a blink and you'll miss it line where Abraxas notices her Adam's apple. But yes it will be nice when such character can exist in fiction and it not be any more note worthy than having a person with say blond hair
        ```

        - u/CeruleanTresses:
          ```
          Oh, shame it wasn't made clearer then, but still nice that it was included. I'm glad that this time it was closer to being explicit--saying that his name used to be Simone, and that his masculine face was unattractive as Simone's but attractive as Simon's, is pretty much as good as saying "Brother Simon was a trans man" and more organic to boot.
          ```

  - u/Razorhead:
    ```
    /u/ErraticErrata confirmed this in the thread over at /r/PracticalGuideToEvil, so yes you are correct.
    ```
