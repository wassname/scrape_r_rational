## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  [Industrial Strength Magic](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/57011/industrial-strength-magic) by Macronomicon just ended, I enjoyed the story overall, though some parts, including the ending, were a bit lackluster.

  As a sort of palate cleanser, Macronomicon has started a new series, [The Legend of William Oh](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/92144/the-legend-of-william-oh), which I’ve been following on Patreon for a month. It’s now released on RoyalRoad with a solid start of 15 chapters. The author sold the story as similar to Diablo or Remnant 2, a classic Tower climber fantasy built around creating synergies between different items and abilities.

  This story has a lot of charm for me. It’s very modern writing, with humor that sometimes borders on crack-fic, yet it’s well-executed and genuinely funny. The protagonist isn’t an adult, and the story leans into the idea that kids do dumb stuff in a way that I appreciate. Despite this, the main character is highly driven and shows a lot of potential for growth.

  Unlike other Macronomicon protagonists, Will doesn’t start out overly strong, which I appreciate. He’s going to have to build a team with others who have their own unique item combinations. Some of these combinations get pretty broken. For example, there’s a character who can control bugs to a limited extent, and gains an item that increases the movement speed of his controlled creatures by 1 foot per second. As you can imagine, the scaling gets fun and wacky.

  While definitely not for everyone, I find this story a breath of fresh air compared to much of the fantasy I’ve been reading lately. It’s still early days, but the first 17 chapters on Patreon sold me on the story. It’s quick and efficient—read the first 5 chapters, and you’ll definitely know if it’s for you.

    It's fun so far--Macronomicon is just a good writer--and it really moves fast and with agency. 

    It is *very* similar to the author's other works though. Young male protagonist with basically no relational attachments embodies the /r/wizardposting ideal: being a kickass wizard is the only correct choice when faced with any decision. 

    Props to Macronomicon finding a fiction-writing recipe that works.

      You’re definitely right, I’m lucky in that I both enjoy most of that formula, and find the twists he adds to each series interesting.

  What are rational-ish stories that have as at least a strong side focus on a relationship/s not necessarily romantic though preferred?

  The ones I am aware of and read are in no particular order:

  * Worth the Candle
  * Fall of Doc Future universe
  * Birds of Feather
  * Luminosity/Radiance
  * later third or so of Mother of Learning
  ```

  - u/CaramilkThief:
    ```
    If you're okay with quests, Marked for Death is as naruto quest with a strong focus on relationships (not just romantic). Sometimes it gets a bit too much though I'd say, since there's a feeling of putting out relationships fires instead of handling the dangers of ninja life. 

    The Years of the Apocalypse is touted to be like Mother of Learning except the story explores the protagonist's relationships with other people while living in a time loop. How making and remaking bonds with people takes a toll on the protagonist's psyche, etc. 

    Similarly, Re:Monarch is another time loop story with some well developed relationships (not just romantic). 

    For something less rational, you could also take a look at Warby Picus' stories. His main schtick is writing stories where a socially ostracized person goes on a journey to find a community he can feel safe in, along with some sweet romantic subplots. They aren't rational in the problem solving sense, but I feel like they're all emotionally mature stories. Warby understands the human condition well, and emotional developments don't feel unearned or out of character. I highly recommend his Slumrat Rising, and To the Far Shore is also great.
    ```

  - u/MagicWeasel:
    ```
    Vampire Flower Language (https://archiveofourown.org/works/13710744/chapters/31496223) is a rational vampire romance novel, and focuses entirely on relationships and interpersonal stuff, mostly romantic. 

    Very different from Luminosity/Radiance.

    [_Time Braid_](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644/1/Time-Braid) (Sakura/Hinata/Naruto) would be my top recommendation by far, with some of the most beautiful romance I have ever read. A few others:

    * [_The Moon's Apprentice_](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/196256/the-moons-apprentice) (Twilight Sparkle/Twinkleshine)
    * [_Myou've Gotta be Kidding Me_](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/33512/myouve-gotta-be-kidding-me), first half (Missy/Miss Cheerilee)
    * ["The Thousand Year Romance Of Clover The Clever"](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/138977/the-thousand-year-romance-of-clover-the-clever) (Clover The Clever/Smart Cookie)
    * [_Friendship is Optimal_](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/62074/friendship-is-optimal) (David/Butterscotch)
    * [_Mortal_](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/95424/mortal)/["Mother of Nations"](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/134664/mother-of-nations) (not so so much shipping, but very strong focus on character relations)

    If you're okay with polyamorous relationships, [Katalepsis](https://katalepsis.net/) is a good read. Urban fantasy story about a girl who all her life thought she was suffering from psychosis; turns out she really can see otherworldly things and sometimes randomly slips into other worlds.

- u/fish312:
  ```
  Are there any good stories (preferably Isekai) where the main character's strength is  **fantasy engineering** on a *personal* scale (imagine a Tinker MC from Worm)? 

  I used the word engineering very loosely. It could be any kind of *applied magitek*, potion-making, spell-crafting, artificing-magic-items, you get the idea.  

  I'm not looking for *societal wide* changes - think less "uplift-society-by-inventing-tractors-and-guns" and more "tony-stark-runecrafting-logic-gates". 

  Ideally the engineering shouldn't be hand waved away. Bonus points if they're the underdog of the setting.

    There's 2 that spring to mind, but fair warning, they both quickly descend into cringy harem wish fullfilment territory. 

    - [Daniel Black series](https://www.goodreads.com/series/144936-daniel-black): Daniel gets isekai'd by the greek goddess Hecate to save her last follower in a Europe where the Norse pantheon wiped away all competition and Ragnarok is about to begin. Pros: Lots of magical theorycrafting and problem solving. Cons: The author has never known the touch of a woman. 
    - [Conrad Stargard series](https://www.goodreads.com/series/43333-conrad-stargard): Conrad gets sent back in time to Poland just prior to the mongol invasion for ~~inscrutable~~ very scrutable reasons. Pros: The uplift is... not terrible, as uplifts go. Conrad eventually fucks >!his magic shapeshifting horse!<. Cons: The author doesn't even try to depict what people in medieval Poland would actually be like. Conrad eventually fucks >!his magic shapeshifting horse!<.

        The dude mostly writes pretty wierd (borderline illegal) erotica
        ```

        - u/GlueBoy:
          ```
          Borderline illegal? Which one is that. I know he has 3 published series, Daniel Black which I mentioned above, Perilous Waif, a space opera with a female protagonist which he manages to pull off surprisingly well, and Jungles of Alabama, a system apolcalypse litrpg featuring a BDSM swinger(?) who gets mentalist powers or something and his golden retriever becomes a sexy dog girl. I nope'd out of that one pretty fast when I saw where that was going.
          ```

          - u/Dragongeek:
            ```
            Well he writes all sorts of unpublished stuff on QQ (username "ShaperV") but the biggest issue is fetishizing underage characters. Like in *Perilous Waif*, it's handwaved away because the protagonist is a transhuman who "matures faster" or whatever it was, but it has the same energy as young girl characters in anime where "it's okay because she's actually a 600 y/o vampire".


            *Perilous Waif* is interesting though (I've written a full-length review on it before) and cautiously recommended it as solid sci-fi that does a bunch of cool new things, if you can deal with the squick factor.
            ```

            - u/k5josh:
              ```
              That's not borderline illegal, though. In the US, it's *extremely difficult* for text-only erotica to be borderline illegal.
              ```

    - u/ReproachfulWombat:
      ```
      I'd like to add to the list of Cons for the Daniel Black series that the author has strongly-held Political and Social Views and will use the characters as mouthpieces for them in almost everything he writes. Expect them to regularly turn to the reader and recite in droning monotone the evils of Big Government, Feminism, The Left, and Social Justice Warriors and so-on, even if they're in the middle of an apocalypse. Admittedly, I only read the first book of DB, so I'm not sure if he was as bad in that as he is in his later work.
      As an example, he wrote Jungles of Alabama after being criticised a bunch for his sexualisation of minors (rightly or wrongly), and so we got this wonderful gem early on in the book:

              “She’s usually not like that! Look, I can’t just, just shrug and
              let a couple of strangers walk off with Shasa. We don’t have any
              procedures for something like this. For all I know you could be
              child predators or something. I mean, she’s like a little girl
              in an adult body!”

              Right, because of course every male is a vile monster constantly
              looking for a chance to abuse any poor, helpless woman he can
              get his paws on. People like that piss me off so much.

              I thought about pointing out that she'd been an adult dog before
              the change, and her human form looked to be about twenty. Or
              that the mere fact that she'd been in the clinic when she
              changed didn't give the vet's office any particular legal or
              moral authority to determine her fate. Or that I was looking for
              a survival companion, not a sex object. Jesus fuck, she was
              literally a dog a few hours ago. What kind of person immediately
              jumps to thoughts of sexing her up?

      I should also point out that yes, the protagonist gets sexual with her pretty much immediately, which sort of undercuts the argument.

      I personally find that this sort of thinly veiled soapboxing pulls me right out of my immersion.

      Edit: I've just realised, but the protagonist actually >!fucks his magical shapeshifting animal companion!< in *both* of these recommendations. Huh.
      ```

      - u/GlueBoy:
        ```
        > edit:

        Umm ackchyually, I never recommended Jungles of Alabama. As I said elsewhere, the dog thing combined with Alabama as a setting made me nope out pretty early in the book. Godspeed, dogfucker!

        In Daniel Black he does >!fuck a demi-goddess who is part wolf creature and another who is basically a tree!<, but only in their human forms, which is totally okay, right? Right?!

        /Moral high ground

    Arcane Ascension is a pretty hard magic system that follows an Enchanter. Pretty good, not isekai.

    The Runesmith




    The writing can be quite redundant at times, but once you get used to it you can just skim those paragraphs, and whats left is a very solid story of becoming isekai ironmam




    It helps a lot that the mc needs to relocate every time he ranks up, looking for more knowledge and resources, and the trade flow to fund his research, so it truly feels like he is chasing his goals


    His personality is introverted and just a little paranoid, so it feels natural when he holes up to craft




    The side characters are very serviceable too, they are introduced, they met, camera cut, a little timeskip and they already have a dinamic going on, so it doesnt have those forced first interactions that can become so annoying




    (Dis) Honorable mention to May As Well Cheat, a horny novel and manga about an isekaid guy who can materialize potions



    He sells them to live on easy mode visiting brothels, until he discovers the world has mechs and tries to become a certified pilot



    The magic flow of sex techniques translates into magic flow for mech control, but its up to him to discover how exactly that can be used



    Its one of the few isekais with a reasonable inner workings of the army, including dealing with the guilds


    And the world is very sexually liberated


    The manga has the particularity of the sex scenes being replaced with wrestling, naval battles, swordsmanship, spelunking, and many other methapors

  This is not a strong requirement though, just the vibe. I want a neurotypical (I guess?) protagonist with side characters that decidedly aren't. Their power also doesn't literally have to be being sane, just their role in the party has to be the voice of reason I guess.

    [World Trigger](https://mangadex.org/title/7ae7067a-7e68-4bd2-a064-5e3e3c059078?tab=chapters) has a *genuinely* very weak MC, he's really just a relatively normal, slightly clever dude. Story has very well done, tactical combat.

  I've come to realize that I love multi-perspective novels, especially where the POV's have either asymmetrical information or have directly competing interests. Think Andy Weir's The Martian for the first one, Michael Grant's Gone series or Jim Butcher's Furies of Calderon for the second. 

  While I am a huge fan of Pokemon: The Origin of Species, this is less aligned with what I'm looking for in this particular request. This story does follow three perspectives, but it's more akin to getting different looks into careers/life in the Pokemon world and how each POV manages to make a change oftentimes independent of each other. The POV's in the first three examples all take action that directly affect actions taken by the next POV. This results in games of cat and mouse, plans gone astray, and sometimes utter chaos which is fun to see unwind.

  Would love more recommendations to put on the to-read-list. Can be any genre, and does not have to be rational, so long as none of the POV's hold the idiot ball.

    *A Song of Ice and Fire* and *The Stormlight Archive* are both multi-perspective stories, if you somehow haven't read them yet.

    Also try out *This Is How You Lose the Time War*. It alternates perspectives each chapter, with a different author writing each of the perspectives. I didn't love it but I know a lot of people did.

    ```
    A Practical Guide To Evil is great for this. Many villainous or side characters get quite a few POV chapters, and there's a lot of information hidden from the protagonists/blue orange morality/very distinct character voices going on. It's not true multi-pov, it's probably 60% from the MC's point of view, but it's a master class on the usage of interludes to advance the story and build the world.

    I’ve yet to read RI, but from what I know of it, Fang Yuan is supposed to be a schemer right? 

    In that case, you might want to check out Sixteen Ways to Defend a Walled City by K.J. Parker. Its main character, Orhan, is a cunning bastard that’s willing to do anything to survive a siege. 

    Although I wouldn’t considering him hyper intelligent, he’s definitely clever in a way that feels realistic. Like I said, never read RI, but I get the impression that he’s more similar to Fang Yuan than he is to Harry from MoR.

    Edit: it’s not a very long story, but it is apart of a trilogy that includes spinoffs - I haven’t read those yet.
    ```

    - u/Rhamni:
      ```
      > I’ve yet to read RI

      I gave up around chapter 230. He's not shown to be intelligent, just constantly claims to be, while benefiting from a time reversal that leaves him alone in possession of some secret knowledge. Like "Where is the treasure hidden" or "This sect leader is vulnerable to blackmail because his son is an idiot who provably passed a test thanks to daddy helping him cheat."

      The main character in Reverand Insanity lives life on Extra Easy mode. His main appeal to some readers is that he's a sociopath who doesn't mind picking the evil option if it's faster/easier/safer, but is quite happy to help other people when it's genuinely helpful to him as well.
      ```

      - u/gfe98:
        ```
        Reverend Insanity does vaguely have the Xianxia trope of the MC starting in the weakest family of the weakest village of the weakest mountain of the weakest region, etc.

        So there indeed aren't any remotely impressive antagonists in Gu Yue village or while Fang Yuan is escaping with Bai Ning Bing. There is gradual escalation in the antagonists and how much pressure Fang Yuan is under over the course of the novel.

        I've seen some people drop the story at certain points because they felt like the author was too harsh on the MC. That may only be relative to other translated Xianxia though...
        ```

          Thank you for providing an actual argument. I can see how that would lead to a shift over the course of the story.
          ```

      - u/Trew_McGuffin:
        ```
        Took a quick look at 230 since you mentioned it. He just started leaving the starting village and it's after the bone heist, dang what a blast from the past. Same with 300 XD. Half of me would like to read your thoughts on 398 but the other half kinda figures 399 would disinterest you further on RI as a whole. Unfortunately, Fang Yuan's opposition doesn't start getting good until immortals rank 6 and up start getting involved. In my opinion.

        Preemptive: Yes I know "It doesn't get good until X" doesn't inspire one to power through something, I'm not trying to get anyone to.

        I don't really recall Fang Yuan himself claiming to be intelligent? ruthless to himself/others, shameless, and willing to go to extremes for his overarching goal yup. Not so much something to the tune of 'I am so smart'.

        Not sure how him benefiting from future who, what, where, how, and whys relates to Fang Yuan perceiving himself as intelligent? Apologies, I'm having trouble understanding why you're bringing it up. Minor nitpick, it was an elder not the sect leader. Overall, your first bit falls a bit flat unless you're willing to elaborate or amend what you're trying to get across.

        Spoiler but >!Fang Yuan's circumstances, what you call!< "life on Extra Easy mode" >!is a plot point that gets elaborated on. He's a fly in a spider's web!<.

        I can't help but disagree with calling Fang Yuan a sociopath, mostly because of the baggage associated with the term but yeah the end bit I feel you got it in one. If he benefits more from being evil then he'll be evil and he gets more from being good than he'll be good. That however isn't his main appeal to what's probably the largest chunk of the fanbase (or at the very least me and those like me).

        It's that he's a breath of fresh air in the desolate wasteland of Chinese translated, brain dead, nationalist, sexist, juvenile, system golden finger, pedo/ephebo bait, harem, and I'll repeat this for emphasis b r a i n     d e a d  xianxia/cultivation genre.

        TLDR: Can't say I endorse No\_Dragonfruit\_1833's responses, chill maybe?

        Good, good, good. Junior No\_Dragonfruit\_1833! You come across as a young master in need of some face slapping. It's enough to make this senior cry tears of blood and suffer qi deviation that you're out here putting Reverend Insanity's worst foot forward.
