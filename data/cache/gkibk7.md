## [RT][WIP][HF] The Whispering Light - Chapter Update

### Post:

After trying and failing to rescue the town Potsdoor from the mysterious Walking Corruption, and having most of their equipment ruined in the attempt, Redmun and Jessamine try to cross the perilous Howling Plains to get to the nearest spec of civilation, Lutmouth. After encountering Layla, an abandoned traveller incapable of defending herself, the two argue whether even trying to rescue her is worth the effort, considering their own poor state, and the perilous, Evil-ridden stretch that lays before them.

Since I've not been posting here regularly I posted the link to the whole story, in case people catch up. Although I've been receiving positive responses elsewhere, I was hoping to get a little feedback from my Rational folks. Again this was not necessarily meant as a strictly Rational story, but all of my writing does focus on hard magic, strong logic and smart characters.

  I haven't read it yet, just wanted to give you a heads up it looks like you have chapter six posted twice and "TWo" instead of "Two" for chapter two.
