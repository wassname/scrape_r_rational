## [D] Friday Open Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could (possibly) be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.

  I've been spending some time recently thinking about the different sub-groups in our little rational community, and I think there are at least two distinct groups with similar, but tangibly different preferences.  I think of them as the MinMaxers and the Story Purists.

  MinMaxers are the people for whom the point of the story is all about the world-building and system of the work of fiction.  These are the people who enjoy, say, quests or LitRPGs because all the abilities are very well quantified, and the judge a work of fiction by the coherence of it's systems and the munchkinery of the characters living in that system.  They also are the ones who most appreciate Fair-play whodunnit, or other stories in which it is possible to reason your way into figuring out a character's actions before they occur.

  Story Purists are the people for whom the story is the point, and the rational trappings are just means to a better story.  They focus on rational aspects like the examination of goals and motives and intellectual pay-off, because they are inherently more narratively satisfying than a deus ex machina ending.  They don't necessarily want stories that are categorically different from works outside the rational community (the way MinMaxers might), they just want fewer characters holding the idiot ball.

  I would place myself firmly in the Story Purist camp.  I've long since given up keeping track of things like Juniper's ability interactions (or even his base ability categories) in Worth the Candle, but I keep reading it because the characters interact intelligently and the story is engaging.  By the same token, I really enjoy the abilities in Practical Guide to Evil, because they are well defined enough that I feel like i have a sense of what can and can't happen, but I don't have to worry about little details like how much mass Cat can lift with her shadow powers or small details things like that.

  Where do you feel like you fall?  Or would you say you're somewhere in the middle?  Or does the dichotomy not ring true at all?

    I don't know about applying a dichotomy to individuals; I can enjoy different things for different reasons and I'm not a freaky mutant. I don't particularly expect to see all the things I enjoy in the same story, though that's cool when it happens. Some of the big ones:

    * Characters with internality - people act like there are people inside of them. They have reasons for being the way they are, they have an internal inertia to how they think and feel about things, the writer could write a monologue of their thoughts whenever they're on screen (even if they never do). I kind of think anything that doesn't have this is sort of... literary junk food? It can still be good, but there's a limit. Wildbow's works are all great at internality.

    * Characters with epistemology - people have a specific way of integrating new information, which is different from character to character. Harry Potter And The Natural 20 does the best job of this, as a joke. I'd really like to see more of it.

    * Self-consistent world - sort of table stakes for any sort of munchkinry, it can also undermine plot and character development if the world is too unstable. But you can be like PGTE and never give a hard number to anything while still being pretty self-consistent. Part of self-consistency is that the components interact correctly with each other, which means that munchkinry to me is just a way of revealing a form of consistency.

    * Constant drip of new ideas - not really high art but it can make for compelling light reading. If all the new stuff interact correctly with the self-consistent world so far then that's really quite nice. Revealing a new interaction is as good as revealing an entirely new element, which again lets munchkin stories do some cool things.

    * Believable stakes - the stakes are the bad things that might happen to your characters that I actually believe the author is willing to do to them. Life and death situations are rarely stakes, because I can see how much more book there is. Risk of long-term injuries and mental trauma (hi Wildbow) or failure to achieve personal goals (P:TOS) are much better stakes.

    It occurs to me that Pokemon: The Origin Of Species is really doing a great job of all of these.

    This reminds me of an exchange I had with someone here a while back. They said they preferred the protagonists in stories they read to have as few morals as possible, simply because it let them do more "cool things" with the magic/sci-fi of the setting.

    As a Story Purist myself, it felt like I was talking to an alien. I found this eye opening, and it's my go-to reference for just how subjective art can be.

  What have you been doing to stay sane while at home?  Me and my wife went on a nature walk yesterday.  It was great, we didn't see almost anyone and had fun digging for quartz (no fossils though).

    I've got a four-year-old, so:

    * Writing six page books with him
    * Putting together all our Lego sets
    * Reading to him
    * Making up stories with him
    * Playing cars
    * Trying to educate him

    I was a stay-at-home dad anyway, so not much has changed except that we can't go to all the fun places that we used to go to, and preschool is cancelled for what I assume is going to be the rest of the school year.

    I've been cooking and cleaning, both things that I normally do.

    Our D&D group is going to (try to) go digital, so we'll see how that works. IME it's not as fun and there are always technical issues, but I'm dusting off an old campaign and giving it a shot, which will be my first time DMing in about two years.

      Does your group read WtC? How meta do your table conversations get?
      ```

      - u/alexanderwales:
        ```
        Current group is just two guys, but they're both up-to-date on it, so far as I know. We're actually doing the Critter Islands campaign briefly mentioned in ch 105 ("Notes"), since that's a familiar setting for me ([worldbuilding doc here, if you're into that kind of thing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZEEMqsW05SEGhp42JLmHOTVy_elHOXIXGJfpKbvqH-U/edit?usp=sharing)). I think my biggest challenge will be not unintentionally cannibalizing stuff from WtC, which has a bunch of ideas splattered across its many pages. (I have some good stuff planned though.)

      Even when we didn't have technical issues, we had issues with people zoning out during other players' turns.

    Trying to convert the boardgame group to a videogame group. It's a bit tricky. It's paradoxically much easier to get people to commit to *going to a place* than to *be online and willing to play* at a given time. But it's early days, I'm sure people will get used to it.

        Because I'm a stereotypical aspie, I made a [detailed list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OgyskrfPLl0_c8eNuHbiczNPCFo0EpVn3Q_Gw_5_BDk/edit?usp=sharing). But so far we haven't managed to get more than two people together at the same time, which cuts down on options.

        ~~We have a Blood Bowl 2 league. It's a decent (if a bit dated, in how punishing the RNG can be) 2 player tactics game, each match takes ~45 min and your team's scores and progress is tracked within the league.~~ You know, I've played it again tonight and decided I don't like it after all. 45min is an optimistic length, it can easily go twice that, so what fun it has to offer is stretched too thin.

        There's been a couple of Tabletop Simulator games organised (War of Whispers). I'm not a huge fan of boardgaming on PC, especially on games without automatic rules enforcement it's the worst of both worlds, but obviously coming from a boardgame group it's an easier sell.

        I've played Overcooked yesterday with Steam's Remote Play Together (sharing my keyboard). It's an excellent co-op party game. I'm looking forward to the absolute chaos that 4-player should be, though we may have to use Overcooked 2 instead as Remote Play with four requires at least two people to use controllers.

          Wow, you weren't lying when you said detailed. This is a very nice list.

          I see you have listed Dominions 4, but Dom5 is now out. Community has largely switched to that. It is a great game!
          ```

          - u/Roxolan:
            ```
            Thanks. Huh, wonder why the 4th hasn't been more discounted then. 

            I don't think we'll choose this one anyhow (it wasn't me that put it on the list). Opinions is that it's *scarily* high-investment. I've had it on my wishlist for a while as a curiosity for solo play, but price never went down enough to justify it.

              I got it during last steam sale for... 40% off or something. Its really very good. Haven't seriously tried online multiplayer.

    I'd love to go on a hike or nature walk, but our local park is very explicitly Closed (prompting my 10 year old to complain in a most stereotypical manner than the civilization-threatening global pandemic was "*ruining* my *life*").

    Aside from that we've been doing schoolwork, which takes about an hour a day.  Some puzzles, some legos, "gym class" in the back yard, reading and playing video games.  One of my stockpile items was microwave popcorn, so nights have frequently been a movie and popcorn.

    ```
    I'm working from home, so a lot of my off time has been spent rehabilitating my place into a state where it's not a horrible idea to be spending 24 hours a day here.

    To be honest, it was never really *that* bad, but there's a bunch of cleaning that I no longer have a plausible excuse to be putting off.
    ```

  - u/jtolmar:
    ```
    I already work from home so it's less of an adjustment for me. The two biggest things for me are maintaining a consistent work/exercise/sleep schedule, and making an effort to stay in touch with people on a regular basis.

    For exercise I converted notes I got from the gym coach at my old job into an app. [I've uploaded that](http://noisyowl.com/robologan/) for general use due to the quarantine, if you need it. I'm pretty strict about my schedule, especially sleep schedule. I use melatonin during the winter to manage that, but that might last later in the year if I spend so much time inside.

    I also made myself an app for keeping track of how long it's been since I've seen everyone, but it'll take longer to convert that from what's usable by me personally to something that I can share with the world^(*). It grew out of a spreadsheet of names, how often you want to talk to them (days between), and last time contacted, which you can make for yourself quickly enough if you want one.

    ^(*) Turns out that manually adding JSON to the source code is easier than writing and using a form UI. That doesn't work for other people.

  I work for the  government. Our state premier (=governor) recently announced that he didn't want Australia to close down.

  I'm not going to be working from home for at least two weeks, if ever. 

  We're so isolated we don't have easy access to medical supplies, and we're very limited on those. 

  FML.
