## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  Take a look at /r/WoodrowWilsonGame, a subreddit where we attempt to blame everything in the past century on Woodrow Wilson through long, torturous chains of logic. Those who enjoy absurd historical arguments will find this amusing. Extra points for not referencing the Treaty of Versailles!

  A few weeks ago we talked about what rational fiction *is*. Let's talk about the *why*. Why are we here, why do we (want to) read/write rational fiction?

  Do you like intelligent conflicts? Complex moral conflicts? Or see it as a tool to spread rational thinking? Like peripherally-relevant topics, such as transhumanism/AI/X-risks/deconstructions? Are bad at suspending disbelief and can only find sanctuary here? *Be detailed.*

  You would probably want to include a short description on what you think rational fiction *is*, since opinions on that vary from ["fiction that shows the virtue of intelligence"](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/69f7nw/d_friday_offtopic_thread/dh6lra8/) to ["fiction that employs L1 intelligent characters"](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/69f7nw/d_friday_offtopic_thread/dh78lsd/) to ["fiction that fully exploits its core idea"](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2txg42/metad_they_should_have_sent_a_poet/) to "fiction that loosely fits [these](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index#wiki_characteristics_of_rationalist_fiction) criteria" to "whatever /r/rational likes". (The "L1 intelligent characters" is mine).

  ___

  *My* main reason is that I usually lose the ability to care about their story the moment I recognize that the main character(s) of the media I'm consuming are trying to achieve their goals in a blatantly non-optimal fashion. After that happens, I'm completely incapable of actually *cheering for them*. I may still care about the plot/mysteries/battles/etc, but I no longer see the characters as *people* I'm supposed to sympathize with; they become plot devices/automatons that should better sort out their irritating problems already and hurry up with the plot. Any character development, epic moments or hot-blooded speeches would be seen by me as [narm](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm): "was that meant to be taken seriously?", "oh, how adorable, this construct acts as if it's a real boy!". (It could be seen as me having an incredibly poor ability to suspend disbelief when it comes to people: I have no such problem with blatant physics violations, as example.) If the main characters are important to the plot, it would almost certainly make any ending unsatisfactory.

  Which implies that almost every time I put myself into the character's place and expect to *do better*, I stop caring about the plot.^1 Considering what most of "normal" media consist of... It's no surprise that I seemed used to not even bothering with *modeling* characters of works I read/watch, opting to simply witness sequences of events: it's not like I was missing anything. I didn't usually pick sides, either, I was as happy with villains winning as I was with heroes. (Which was the case since childhood. It had interesting consequences for my attitude towards fiction and the world in general, but that's beyond the scope of this post.)

  Rational fiction was a... rather refreshing experience. Discovering it was purely a good thing: while some other people were "ruined" by it, so to speak, being unable to enjoy "normal" fiction afterwards, I didn't lose anything, since I already *was* ruined.

  Another reason is that I like interesting, unique plots, characters and settings. While deconstruction and avoidance of cliché are not *fundamental* properties of rational fiction as I see it, a strong correlation exists all the same, which is a nice bonus.

    Why? I love mysteries, and all of my favorite rational fiction stories are either straightforward mysteries or mysteries turned upside-down or inside-out.

    Conventional mysteries present events that have happened, usually suspicious deaths, and then follow protagonists who unravel the actions and interactions that preceded those events. Who did what when, and why? Enjoyment comes from cleverness on the part of the detectives, catching subtle mistakes on the part of the murderers, and my own enjoyable analysis of available data as the detective encounters it.

    We're each speculating and it's only slightly more enjoyable when I make a connection or harbor a suspicion than when an intelligent protagonist does so.

    Mysteries don't have to follow detectives, however. They can follow potential victims as they sense a web closing in on them and try to identify their murderer before it's too late. They can follow murderers as they plan and execute their crime, then defend themselves from detectives.

    No matter what, the writer must create a story and a world that can be safely unraveled without collapsing. And I continue reading in order to solve a fair, well-designed puzzle and to watch it solved. Even if it's nothing more than "Oh wow, how can this possibly end well?"

      Fun fact about Worm: during at least some of the major fights, including Leviathan, Wildbow rolled dice to see who would die. Taylor nearly did, and if she had then the story would probably have continued with Aegis, if I remember correctly. Either way, it certainly wasn't 100% that Taylor was going to beat Sophia.

    Speaking for myself, personally, I mostly just like clever scifi/fantasy world building with well-fleshed-out and elegant magic systems (with fewer ad hoc components, ideally, though I'm ok with a slow reveal, so long as everything fits together consistently), as well as general munchkinry, nerd power fantasy, and competence porn. I'm not as interested in the "tool to spread rational thinking" bits, and usually just skip over any attempts at pedagogy. But I also don't really consider myself a rationalist (aspiring or otherwise) as it's used around here, and so may be atypical in this regard. I also enjoy nitpicky, rant-y deconstructions of works that I otherwise love, and in depth discussions of little details in other works of fictions that, if exploited, would derail the entire original plot.

    Since you reposted my essay, I've been thinking about that topic a bit more and seem to have hit on an evolution. Yes, rational fiction should exploit its premise to the fullest extent, but that creates confusion. So I'm wondering if the difference is thinking of rational fiction as a *genre* or as *style*. I have some notes on an essay to explore this further, but I don't have time to write it at the moment.

  In my continuing series of first world problems that I use as an excuse to overanalyze my psychology, I started watching the show Gargoyles I wish I liked it more. It's a good, perhaps even great, cartoon created by the same guy who later made Young Justice that delivered a story on par with adult entertainment nearly a decade before Avatar started the trend of mature children's shows.

  The problem I have with it is that it's so much better than its contemporaries that the nitpicks I have about character development and plot inconsistencies stand out way more than they should. It's season 2 of Young Justice all over again, my expectations are set so high by past experience that I can't help but be disappointed by it doing anything different from what I want it to even though it's not bad at all.

  This is becoming a trend for me and Greg Weisman productions. He is one of my favorite animation creators of all time, but I'm hesitant to watch any more of his stuff because I keep feeling that sense of disappointment. I'm ruining great stories for myself because I'm making unreasonable demands of them. I selfishly desire the same thing I got from a story I loved before and can't accept anything else.

  It's not just Greg Weisman, I'm convinced the same thing happened with me and Unsong. I liked it so much at the beginning that the inconsistencies and unsatisfying plot points stood out even more than they should've and I never finished it. This is beginning to frustrate me since I now recognize it as a trend of behavior that is not beneficial to me but don't know how to stop it.

  Has anyone here read the rationalish Narnia fic [Chanson de Geste](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5615090/1/Chanson-de-Geste)? I can't remember how I found it, maybe related to a /u/tk17studios post listing heroes that included Edmund, but it's really good and I was surprised to not see it mentioned around here before. Maybe it was and I just missed it. 

  Anyway if you're looking for great Narnia fiction, particularly about Edmund and the Witch, check it out. It's fairly short (for an online story, so 70k words), I read it as a quick break between Naruto fanfics (finished Time Braid, halfway through Team Anko now) and really enjoyed it.

    I read and very much enjoyed it. A little more background for anyone interested: it's set post 'The Lion, The Witch & The Wardrobe' with the four Pevensie children still in Narnia and acting as Kings & Queens. However, it's a darker and more mature take on things, with war, politics and subterfuge all playing major roles.

  Speaking of rationality, exercise. I get analysis paralysis easily and there's too much conflicting stuff out there about what's the most effective way to exercise. Has anyone here already sorted through and found something good (ideally supported by science)?

    Most effective at achieving what goals under what limitations? A good program for someone looking to become a competitive ultramarathoner with 20 hours each week to devote to training will look different to one aimed at building a general strength base for powerlifting with 3 hours available each week, which will be different from someone hoping to perform better at adventure sports w/ 60 hrs per week free, etc. And the [outcomes under each](http://www.drmichaeljoyner.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/twins-533x1024.png) can be quite different, too.

    Regardless, if you recognize that you're susceptible to analysis paralysis, I'd say just pick a popular program (e.g. a beginner's lifting program, a C25K type thing, etc.) and try it out. "The best exercise regime is the one you actually do" and all, assuming you don't start out trying to free solo big walls and die a few hours in. Take it slow and and you'll learn more as you go along.

    As for exercise(/nutrition) science, it's hard to get 5 sigma confidence or whatever 'cos humans are complex and coordinating sophisticated, high sample longitudinal experiments is costly. I'd say start by looking at the top posts in fitness specific subreddits (e.g. https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/top/?sort=top&t=all, but see also /r/running, /r/weightroom, /r/bodyweightfitness, etc.). I've read some good summaries (and decent original work) by people like Greg Nuckols (http://gregnuckols.com/, see also https://www.strongerbyscience.com/), Layne Norton (https://www.biolayne.com/), Bret Contreras (https://bretcontreras.com/) and others (e.g. I'm not as big of a fan, but given where we are something like http://bayesianbodybuilding.com/ could be appropriate to mention too). Diving into the primary lit would be a bit too much where you are right now, imo.

    For general fitness, though, I'd say just get out there and do (not dangerous) stuff. Try to find activities that use your whole body, and keep track of some quantifiable (or at least qualifiable) metric (speed, weight lifted, difficulty surmounted, etc.) to make sure you're going somewhere. If something's difficult or tricky try to look up how to do it correctly, and if something hurts back up and assess what you're doing wrong, preferably by asking people who know more than you about that thing and with video documentation of yourself engaged in the activity. Ideally find something active you enjoy doing so it feels less like a chore -- hiking/trailrunning are a popular suggestions there, as are different team sports.

    Find a mode of cardio your body can tolerate and do it for 30-60 minutes at a time, regularly throughout the week.  Repeat until your body can tolerate more and harder cardio.  Work your way up to running.

    Just keep sticking with it.  Exercise is simple but difficult when you're starting, and then gets simple but easily doable as you improve.

    I've also heard high-intensity interval training can give improvement in a shorter exercise session, but I've got no evidence for that.

    Exercise is a bit of a problem because it doesn't show results very quickly so it's not easy to determine whether you're doing it right. If you just generally want to work on your health the best approach is to do exercise long enough that you actually burn your body fat so try to exercise for long stretches of time instead of short periods of time often. Go for cardio stuff because it makes you feel healthier rather quickly, do it consistently for results. 

    If you intend to loose weight start in the kitchen and not in the gym.

    If you want to build muscles or specific muscles I can't help you, you should probably just ask muscled people and do what they say or do research on the internet but beware there are mountains of bullshit out there.

    I do a push/pull/legs split on a five day rotation, but I've been exercising for a few years at this point. Beginners should start with a full body workout three days a week. You can get a full body workout by doing pushups, pullups (a doorframe pullup bar is only $25 at Walmart), and bodyweight squats. 

    If you feel paralyzed by indecision, just *MOVE*. You can start by deciding to do pushups every other day, and that'll get you in the habit of moving. Use youtube and google extensively to make sure you're using proper form (do *NOT* trust yourself to "just know" how to do anything, even something as basic as a pushup; I've personally impinged my shoulder and given myself a mildly winged scapula by being an idiot for the first year I exercised; don't be an idiot, because it can take *months and months* to reverse a mistake).

    Still on the subject of proper form, most people have the idea in their heads that they can do more pushups than they can actually do (EDIT: because most people have seen pushups done incorrectly in movies and TV shows, and have never realized when they've attempted them in the past that they were doing them improperly; if you don't have your body and arms aligned properly and you don't go through the full range of motion and you don't do them slowly (if you don't do them slowly then gravity is doing half the work on the way down and momentum is doing half the work on the way up) then you can do a lot more reps than you ought to be able to do; [here's a decent link](https://www.outsideonline.com/2001321/youre-doing-your-push-ups-wrong)).

    When I started exercising and did pushups with proper form for the first time, I maxed out at, like, 6 reps. I got better by doing one set of 3 reps then two sets of two reps (obviously you rest for anywhere from 45 seconds to 3 minutes between sets), resting the next day, repeating those reps/sets, resting the next day, and repeating that procedure until that last rep of the last set wasn't a struggle anymore, then changed it to two sets of 3 reps and one set of two reps, three sets of 3 reps, 4 reps 3 reps 3 reps, 4 reps 4 reps 3 reps, 4 4 4, 5 4 4, 5 5 4, 5 5 5, 6 5 5, 6 6 5, 6 6 6, etcetera. I'm at the point where I do 15 15 15 pushups while wearing a bookbag with two 15lbs dumbbells in it, then do 8 8 8 on a dumbbell bench press with two 30lbs dumbbells, then do 8 8 8 on dumbbell flies with two 15lbs dumbbells, then do another 10 10 10 on unweighted pushups.

    Even taking a 15 minute walk once per day is better than doing nothing at all. Cardio is good, and most research into the mental effects of exercise (postponing/preventing Alzheimer's, reducing depression, increasing memory, stimulating neurogenesis) is centered around cardio. However, strength training raises your resting metabolic rate, so if you lift weights (or do bodyweight exercises like pushups/pullups/squats) you'll burn more calories over the course of the day while you sit around doing nothing than you'd burn riding a stationary bike for an hour.

    Ideally, you ought to do both aerobic and anaerobic exercise, but like I said, doing something is always better than doing nothing. Even if you live in a one bedroom apartment and have agoraphobia, you can manage to pace briskly back and forth in your bedroom for 15 minutes a day.

        It's well known that it takes a higher BMR to support muscle than fat;  here's an article that seems well-cited: https://muscleevo.net/muscle-metabolism/

        (note that  the article is saying that the benefits are overstated, but a pound of muscles burns 3x more calories than a pound of fat regardless; but 10lbs of muscle will only earn you another 60 calories which isn't even an apple's worth. But that doesn't count the calories you burn doing the actual exercise. Still, over the course of a week that will earn you 420 calories which isn't bad. My half-hour-each-way cycle commute earns me about 250cal per day.)

          > ... while the metabolic rate of *resting* muscle isn’t as high as previously thought, the metabolic rate of *recovering* muscle means that people with more muscle mass are going to burn more calories in the post-exercise period.

          I think that's where the confusion lies. If you lift weights 4 or 5 days a week every week for several years, then for all intents and purposes your "resting" metabolic rate *is* your "recovering" metabolic rate; as long as you're working out with proper intensity and frequency, you're never going to not be in a recovery period.

          In the end, regardless of semantics, your body will be burning more calories while you sit on the couch than it would be burning if you didn't lift weights.

    When it comes to bang-for-buck I don't think you can beat [HIIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-intensity_interval_training) too much.

    Though as others mentioned it kind of depends on what you are looking to achieve, HIIT will not be the most efficient way to build muscles for example..

    Honestly, one of the best ways to exercise is to just pick a sport and start playing. I'd suggest a martial art or another competitive 1v1 sport just because those end up having mind games at a mid to high level and I know people on this subreddit love those. I chose fencing myself, mainly because swords. Fencing also has the benefit of being able to read an actual real life munchkin story in Épée 2.0, where Johann Harmenberg broke the sport for a few years.
