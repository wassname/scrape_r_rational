## Assume a fourth spacial dimension that some alien entity can move through. From our perspective, would we see it slowly fading away or abruptly disappearing when it moves through this dimension?

  Basically, the answer boils down to "what shape does the alien entity have in four dimensions?", because it'll cycle through those shapes. 

  Is it a simple hyper-platonic solid? Then it'll shrink down into itself before disappearing. Or, since they're not really that well defined, gradually turn into another solid (like a sphere turning into a cube or something) before disappearing.

  On the other hand, a hyper-cylinder would look like a sphere (probably, I can't do 4d rotations in my head) and remain the same size and shape in 3-space until it suddenly pops out of existence. If the cylinder is all the same color you wouldn't be able to even tell that it was moving in the 4th dimension until it popped out of existence; on the other hand, if you were to apply some hyper-paint to the thing, you'd see it gradually change color. Otherwise, it'd be the same color for the duration of it's existence. This is what happens to the mysterious sphere that appears out of nowhere in Iain M. Banks' *Excession*.

  Moving along from simple shapes, you could maybe have a long human-shaped 4-tube. Then as it moves in the fourth dimension it'll turn into slightly different humans. Potentially becoming smaller as it reaches the "narrow" end of itself. This is sort of the shape that one of the characters in John C. Wright's Chronicles of Chaos takes, though her 4-tube also has some non-human segments as well.

  Of course, this is the simple and easy to understand end of the spectrum. On the other end, it's entirely possible for multiple things that are not connected in 3-space to be connected in 4-space. 

  Imagine making a claw out of your hand, and dipping it through the surface of a still pond. At the interface between air and water, there are suddenly 5 distinct bodies; any flatlanders living on the surface of the pond suddenly see five new entities. And yet, those five entities are not truly separate - they are a single entity, bound through an unintelligible dimension. 

  Along this axis, you could potentially have an entire "race" of beings, who are all simply projections of a single hyper-entity that's merely dipping its \*fingers\* into our reality. The shape those beings take would, again, depend on how the entity's 4-dimensional shape projects into 3 dimensions, but you can easily imagine such creatures "blinking" out of existence and reappearing elsewhere, without traversing the intervening 3-space. The Orz in Star Control 2 are most likely an example of this sort of shenanigans.

    I want to expand on this excellent answer with a specific example, if that's okay!

    My husband's a mathematician with a particular "recreational" interest in hyper-dimensional geometry (his research interests are billiards), so of course when /u/ccc_037 suggested that transformations could be done "rationally" by using a 4D shape jutting different parts of itself depending on what form it takes, I of course had to write how it'd look. 

    I've included background description of the creature's initial form and a little dialogue, but i've marked in bold where the transformation starts if you want to skip to it as it's quite long. 

    -----

    It was, at first glance, a rather unremarkable statue. William had sent and received several during this war, though this one was larger and no doubt older. It was not made of metal or marble, but instead of coarse sandstone that was the light beige of weak tea—brewed for a short time, with more milk than water. It was the hunched form of a creature that Red had never seen before; he guessed that if it were standing straight it would be about twelve feet tall. Red gently ran his hand along the creature’s tail, the rough stone feeling like brushed concrete. It seemed ordinary enough, considering. He wondered if there was anything more to it.

    Red walked around the statue, examining its features. It was humanoid, with a torso full of rippling muscles. Its hands and feet were the size of dishes, tipped with wicked claws. Its tail was fifteen feet long, thick, and ended with a triangular point.

    Its face resembled a particularly gaunt human, sunken and wrinkled with a protruding brow and bat-like ears: smooth and pointed, with ridges lining the inside. Its eyes were studded with pale blue gems; the only colour apart from the pale beige. Coming out of its head were curved, spiraling ram horns. Huge leathery wings were folded at its back. Despite its monstrous appearance, it seemed oddly familiar.

    For all the sculptor’s skill in carving the creature it was posed rather plainly: crouched, all four limbs on the ground, wings folded, its tail curled around the front of it, as though it was sitting and resting. He’d expected a statue of a creature like this—especially one that was meant to be more valuable than the magic apple tree—would be standing on its hind legs and roaring. But maybe vampires thought that would make it seem like they were compensating for something?

    When William entered the sitting room and saw the fifteen foot statue, he immediately sat on the settee, staring at the floor for several minutes. Red stood in the doorway, not sure what he should do. Finally, when Red was wondering if it would be rude for him to leave, William broke the silence.

    “Awaken.” He ordered, the commanding tone well-suited to his voice. 

    The creature obliged, its eyes turning into soulful pale blue orbs. Its ears twitched, picking up unheard sounds. It bowed.

    “Good evening, your majesty. Duchess Elodia wished that I present myself into your service.”

    “Rise.”

    It stood as straight as it could; the height of the ceiling meant that he had to hunch over. 

    “Have you a more convenient form?”

    “I do, your majesty. Do you wish to see it?”

    “Yes.”

    ***transformation start***

    There was a momentary pause as the creature’s skin began to change its pattern minutely, as though the skin was a pond that had had stones thrown into it, ripples propagating across it as the skin itself seemed to oscillate between being slightly closer and slightly further away. It made Red’s eyes hurt a little to look at, as they kept trying to make minute changes to the way they focused on this strange, vibrating skin. 

    The gargoyle’s tail began to grow thinner, as did the hands, horns, wings, and arms as the whole creature began shrinking. Soon, the wings were connected to its body by only a thin tendril that looked like it could not possibly support them before that too disappeared into nothingness, leaving the shapeless beige blobs that once were its wings seeming to float in mid-air. The blobs began to grow smaller until they could no longer be seen. The creature stretched its body upwards, finally able to stand straight as it reached a more reasonable height. It shrunk to seven feet, and settled there. Its horns had now disappeared entirely, and its ears had migrated from the top of its head down to where one might expect them to be, changing from their previously chiropteran appearance into a more familiar human shape. Thick black hair had begun to grow out of its skull, quickly settling on a fashionable short style with a prominent side part. 

    Indeed, the creature was looking mostly human now, and unclothed and clearly male. Red was tempted to look away, preserve some of its dignity, but he could not avert his eyes. This was like nothing he’d ever seen.

    Finally, a brown belt appeared around his waist, looped onto a piece of black cloth that was scarcely wider than the belt itself. A tie appeared around his neck, similarly attached to a shirt collar, but no shirt. A pair of brown shoes—tied with laces—appeared on his feet. 

    The scantily clad man grabbed at his collar, and the rest of the shirt seemed to come into being all of a sudden, rippling momentarily in an unseen breeze. The effect gave Red a slight headache. The tall man performed a similar gesture on his belt, and the pants came into view with much the same effect. Red breathed a sigh of relief; he didn’t think any of his clothing would have fit such a tall man.

    Hope people find that interesting. It took some thinking and discussing with my husband how the clothes would be incorporated into the transformation - if anyone thinks I got any of that wrong, let me know, I'd love to fix it.

      I like what you did with the clothes. I haven't thought of that before, but that does seem like a mostly reasonable way for them to act. However, since the gargoyle moved and then stopped, I would expect his clothes to follow through the movement until they are arrested. I think the clothes should appear shortly after the transformation finishes, only for them to instantly disappear again when their 4-momentum carries them through 3-space and out the other side. I'd also expect them to appear in bizarre disconnected ribbons, tracing the shapes of 4D wrinkles, until they are straightened.

      I'd expect more bizarre disconnected ribbons throughout the entire transformation, actually. A 4-dimensional gargoyle shouldn't have blobby melted wings, it should have a 4-dimensional bone structure supporting its 3D membrane, so you'd see fingers appearing and disappearing as the overall shape shrinks, often broken up or seeming to slide around depending on how they are positioned in 4-space (moving generally away from where the wrist was), before finally the membrane splits apart leaving a cluster of spikes suspended in the air, before those too shrink in on themselves and vanish. Either that, or the wings should disappear almost as quickly as the clothes appear. The blob of hypervolume you describe sounds pretty useless, so the wings would probably just be as flat as possible. But that's boring.

      If I were a gargoyle stepping through 4-space, I expect that it would be hard to keep my tail perfectly aligned to the flatlanders' plane, causing it to break apart and snake around through the air, without the rippling pattern moving with it. And since tails usually point backwards, I'd expect the pointed tip of the tail to briefly reappear before being the last of it to vanish.

      For similar reasons, hair might sprout from the scalp (in flickering static patterns, because you're never actually seeing the same hairs for more than a moment), but depending on how large 4-space is, that might get lost in a halo of suspended strands that flash in and out, where the hairs from other 3D cross sections are hanging over - it might look more like the hair is precipitating out of the air than like it is growing. But if the hair is especially short, then maybe not, or maybe this would only be noticeable at the end.

      Of course, all this could just be extraraneous detail that breaks the flow, and it all presupposes different 4D shapes and movements then what you've described, just because I think it would be cooler and more striking. So, y'know, do as you will. I enjoyed thinking about it.

        I enjoyed reading your really thoughtful post! I think you raise some great points and I especially love that it seems that my terrible 4D intuition was mostly OK. 

        RE the appearance of the clothes with 4D wrinkles: when I was conceptualising the clothing, I was imaging him having 3D clothing that he'd just bought off the rack at a store. I likened it to me purchasing a "rubber band" in Flatland for me to wear around my finger. It doesn't come close to "covering my body", but as far as a flatlander is concerned, they never see my naked flesh. That said, a 3D object moving through 4D space would probably wrinkle in a strange way, just probably to a more limited extent.

        > it should have a 4-dimensional bone structure supporting its 3D membrane, so you'd see fingers appearing and disappearing as the overall shape shrinks, often broken up or seeming to slide around depending on how they are positioned in 4-space (moving generally away from where the wrist was), before finally the membrane splits apart leaving a cluster of spikes suspended in the air, before those too shrink in on themselves and vanish. 

        This is true, but the gargoyle is made of sandstone (OK, a sufficiently advanced^TM polymer that appears to be sandstone in any meaningful way), so I think I can get away with the blobs? I do have conceptions of higher dimensional "natives" who would have bone structures/etc that operate over 4 dimensions though, where this would  be highly relevant. 

        > I expect that it would be hard to keep my tail perfectly aligned to the flatlanders' plane, causing it to break apart and snake around through the air, without the rippling pattern moving with it. 

        I like this and may use it as an indication he's preoccupied, distracted, or angry. That said, there's no "external" 4D world: the extra dimension is purely used as a sort of "technology" to allow transformation (and some other magic) to work. So Gargoyles are only ever interacting in the 3D plane: they don't talk to each other in 4D-land or anything. So I think, largely, they'd get it pretty right with some fuzzing at the edges.

        > hair might sprout from the scalp (in flickering static patterns, because you're never actually seeing the same hairs for more than a moment)

        This whole thing about the hair is badass and I'm going to have to see if I can write it in a way that makes sense both from a Doylist point of view (can I get the information across clearly enough to the reader without getting super distracting?) and a Watsonian point of view (Red, the viewpoint character, has a lot to process in this moment: how much attention is he *really* paying to the way the hair sprouts?)

        Another fun consequence of being 4D is that the gargoyle has x-ray vision, which has been fun to account for in the story. Also, he uses his "magic" to disappear a mcguffin by throwing it into 4D space. And he has a bag of holding, as he can store items in a "backpack" on one of his "slices".

        Nah, we reasoned that if the clothes slowly appeared, then each cross section would have its own custom-tailored suit that forms a seamless gradient between its neighbours, which seems... impractical. Or, he'd need a 4-dimensional tailor to tailor him a 4-dimensional suit, which would be much less practical as it wouldn't be as easy to change your attire with the times.

        I forget what exactly our logic was with the clothing having to come back into being with a "tug", but I think part of it is that the intertia of it being in 4D space would make it need to be helped along a bit. Maybe it'd slowly "fall" into view given time, but if you want  to not be nude in front of your new friends, you should probably tug your pants into frame.

        I just realised I also wrote a "transforming from human to monster" scene, which I'll include below. It's pretty rough but it has the clothing disappearing and evidence that his weight changes (perpetual motion here we come!):

        -----

        And so, he begins to change. First, the top of his jeans disappears, and the legs slowly begin to vanish as his thighs and calves begin to expand. They do not appear to melt into his skin; no, they seem to simply vanish.  Each part of him grows larger and minutely more beige in colour. Small hovering blobs appear behind his shoulders and near the floor, beginning to grow little tendrils, reaching towards his body. His shirt disappears, tendrils coming from his shoulders and the base of his spine and reaching towards the three sets of blobs at his back, as they get bigger, undulating ever so slightly before joining together to form a solid mass of wings and a tail. 

        His feet start growing bigger inside his sandals, his toenails growing almost razor sharp. As the fabric of his sandals begins to strain under the rapidly growing foot within, the entire shoe seems to disappear, as well.

        Naturally, he grows heavier; the floorboards creak as the weight that is on them changes; he holds his tail and hands on the ground in an attempt to distribute his weight evenly, but there’s a soft crack as one of the weaker floorboards yields to his mass. 

        He crouches on the floor, holding his head close to the floor so he doesn’t hit himself on the roof. When standing straight, he must be fully 15 feet tall, not including the tail, which adds an additional fifteen feet to his total length. His fingers and toes are both tipped in wicked, curved claws; he doesn’t have feet but a second set of dextrous ‘hands’. He’s a pale, sandy colour with some orange flourishes; the colour of sandstone. Folded at his back are a pair of batlike wings, each three times the size of his torso in area when fully stretched. His long tail snakes out from behind him.

  There's an EXCELLENT anthology for the rational mind, if you can find a copy, called Fantasia Mathematica. It's a collection of short stories, poems, etc. that all relate back to solid mathematics. The reason I bring it up in this context is that at least one of the stories involved trying to communicate with a 4th dimensional being who happened to be intersecting with our section of 3-dimensional space. Not that they realized this at first. But there is a very good analogy about a person moving through a paper-world, much like the one given by u/IICVX related to the hand. Eventually, the protagonist figures out what is going on and prods the cross-section until the equivalent of an eye or an ear or something is in our space so that they can communicate.  


  ...I think there was also a very confusing description of a person getting lost in 4D space, but that may have been another story from the anthology.

  Here's a different answer: string theory relies on there being additional spatial dimensions that are just "too small to detect" - like how a rope might look like a 1D line from far away, even though up close you can see that it's a 2D surface with one of the dimensions rolled up into a small circle.

  What if you *could* move in these rolled-up dimensions? Well, here quantum mechanics rears its head. If the fourth dimension is curled up very small, the quantum states of definite energy will look like sine waves that fit neatly into this curled-up dimension. We're not points at some particular spot in the 4th dimension, instead we're poured into it and fill it up like water filling up a fishtank.

  So an alien that's moving through the 4th dimension smoothly would look constant to us, assuming that we're in the lowest-energy state, because we're already spread out along the 4th dimension. It's just going to have some property that's impossible for us to see, and normal matter that touches it might get evaporated (unless you outlaw the normal physical forces pushing anything in the 4th direction).

  But an alien that's jumping between 4D energy states discontinuously (involving huge amounts of energy, but we might suppose that this energy is *also* coming from / going to 4D space) would be able to turn invisible to us, because different pure sine waves are what's called "orthogonal" - they overlap negatively exactly as much as they overlap positively. So all normal 3D forces would pass through them, and they'd only interact along the 4th dimension.

  So again, this depends on how you decide on physical forces - if the electromagnetic force still works in the 4th dimension, then if you bumped into an alien that was in a different 4D state than you, first of all it's invisible (or at least the parts in a different 4D state are), and when you overlapped in 3D space, the atoms that touched each other might bounce off like billiard balls - your atoms gaining energy and their atoms losing energy. If they're the same momentum state as you, this means you explode and die. But if they're in a different momentum state, maybe conservation of momentum means that all the energy has to stay in the 4th dimension, and so what you see is your atoms disappearing and the aliens' atoms suddenly appearing. Since you need your atoms all together to live, this would be bad.
