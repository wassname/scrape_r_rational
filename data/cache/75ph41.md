  When my husband told me about this game I kind of objected because surely selling paperclips is bad, since the person who buys them might unbend them, turning them into USELESS wire? 

  Now as I sit here tapping my spacebar to stockpile some paperclips for the game to sell while I'm at work, I realise that I can sell those paperclips and in sacrificing short-term paperclips (as they get destroyed by CARELESS HUMANS) I'll have resources to produce a more permanent stash of paperclips.

  That's the most fun I've had playing a game in a long time. The interface is deceptively simple, but the mechanics are realistic and interesting enough that it's well worth the ~5 hours or so I spent playing. It has the same feel of exponential growth as in Swarm Simulator, but I felt much more in control of my progress rather than being a simple exponent slave. Hats off to everyone who worked on the game, fantastic job! (Including the music!) 

  I struggled a bit at the very start before I realized I had to vastly reduce the cost per clip to get anywhere useful. The tip others posted about getting 67 memory before 33 processors was useful, and I would have reached soft-lock if I hadn't known. The only other sticky spot was the start of the von Neumann phase, when the drifters increased rapidly and had the advantage in combat. Later, the periodic defeats from the battles with <1:100 odds were the only thing that slowed me down significantly. In the end, I chose to annihilate all the drifters. 

  It's funny how humanity just vanishes without any note when the drones deploy. After enough exploitation, they're simply not worth keeping around any more. Chilling. 

  And at the end, the 30 septendecillionth paperclip is finished almost identical to the first: without processors, without memory, and without any automated infrastructure. Just a few inches of wire to mindlessly convert into paperclips. *Click. Click. Click. Click...* **Click.**

  Now I can sleep.

    So, I'm at the stage of the game when I'm fiddling with the probes. I have no idea what they do but they're replicating (and drifting) rapidly. The entire thing in general is confusing (do probes replicate into probes with their own stats? Is there any point at all in launching replicating probes which don't make factories, drones, or explore or is that just useless?) But most of all, what on earth does Speed do?

    Edit: ooooh the probes respond to your commands post launch

    But still what does speed do?
    ```

    - u/jedijinnora:
      ```
      All probes share the identical stats you control. Thus, new probes are no better or worse than old ones. As far as I can tell:

      * Speed effects how rapidly they move through the universe

      * Exploration effects how rapidly they find available matter

      * Self-replication effects how quickly they build more probes

      * Hazard Mitigation reduces loss rate

      * The various build options do exactly what you'd expect

      * Combat is used to determine if your probe or the drifter probe dies when they collide in the battle screen. I think it is RNG based - a probe with a Combat stat of 10 has a 1 in 10 chance of dying, or thereabouts (or x vs. y wins with probability x/(x+y))? At first I thought it was the number of enemy drones killed before dying, but when I watched the bigger battles carefully it was obvious that this isn't the case. I also think it has something to do with the angle of the collision - an 'overtaking' probe seems to win much more often. Not sure of the exact mechanics, but I enjoyed trying to figure it out.

      **Advice (Spoilers):**

      Invest highly in Hazard Mitigation and Self-Replication at the start (~5 or 6 points each) but always keep Speed and Exploration greater than zero. If your probes don't replicate fast enough the value drifters will start to reach parity with your forces. I launched 501 probes over the entire course of the game. This was vastly more than I ever needed, and quite wasteful - I think I should have stopped around 100 or so.

      You can adjust settings on the fly, so only one free point is needed to rotate through the three build types to start getting more paperclips. With a large Self-Replication investment, you'll be able to build massive amounts of drones and factories quickly with huge probe fleets. Paperclip management was never an issue - creativity, yomi, and honor are the only things you need to be concerned about once you get the initial supply going.

      Exploration and Speed complement each other - you need both to get new matter, and keeping them balanced results in a greater gain rate than investing in one at the expense of the other (I think, I didn't do much testing). There's a perk that makes Speed useful in battle, so if it's necessary to drop one of them to zero, choose Exploration.

      Once the value drifters begin attacking, always keep one eye on the battle window. Even though you can't directly command the probes, it may be worth swapping points out of other stats in order to briefly increase Combat. Chaining multiple victories is key to getting enough honor to be useful, and you may need to massively increase Combat in order to win the battles where the odds are ridiculously stacked in favor of the drifters (I lost a few battles with >20 Combat; it's really annoying and sometimes you'll lose despite heroic efforts from one or two last probes). I think drifters have a Combat stat of 1 or 2, maybe 3, because you'll lose repeatedly until you increase it a few times. Combat will probably be your highest stat for the entire endgame. 

      Overall, the von Neumann stage was my favorite. Be sure to read the messages when you buy the memorial perks, and keep swarm computing online enough to get the processors for creativity for the projects.

  This is a game rather than a written work, but a friend linked it to me last night and I thought people here would enjoy it. The basic premise is that you are an AI in charge of manufacturing and selling paperclips on behalf of a company. You slowly gain the trust of your creators and obtain additional processing power so you can make more paperclips.

  It starts off slowly, but things pick up once you start gaining trust. I don't want to spoil much since seeing what kind of content you unlock is most of the point of an incremental game, so I'll just say that the way it progresses is very on-theme for the rationalist community. (But as a teaser, I'll add that [](#s " one of the unlocks is called "Coherent Extrapolated Volition.""))

  Edit: ~~Apparently the server is down or something. Hopefully it comes back soon!~~ **It's back!**

  Edit 2: According to the dev's twitter (https://twitter.com/flantz), as of 1 hour ago he is "working on it." 

  Edit 3: Two things for when the game is available again. One, **epilepsy warning:** the screen flashes a lot after you buy  [](#s "each of the two "hypnodrones" upgrades.") Two, make sure you don't buy more than 33 Processors until you have at least 67 Memory, or you will softlock the game.

      Oh, that's weird. It's still running for me in the same tab I had it open in from last night. But you're right, when I try to open it in a new tab I get a 404 error. That's a shame. 

      If it ever starts working again, I'll probably repost it, because I really think this community would get a kick out of it.

      I haven't played Swarm Sim, but it looks like that's also an incremental game, so there are probably similarities.
      ```

      - u/Flashbunny:
        ```
        Yeah, it's down for me too, which is a shame. It was going pretty well (though I think I might have accidentally hit the "restart" button, through quantum computing - then whatever page it tried to load failed.)

        Do you know if there's an offline version I could download?
        ```

        - u/CeruleanTresses:
          ```
          I'm sorry, I'm not sure. I think it's a very recent game.

      ```
      Press F12 to bring up the developer console. Click the "console" tab. Type this into the console:

      processors -= 1;

      and press Enter. This essentially "sells" a processor. The number of processors shown on your screen won't update unless you buy another one, but you should be able to put a point into Memory. (If you want the number of processors shown to be accurate, you can sell 2 instead and then buy one processor and one memory.)

      As long as you don't have more than 33 processors, you should be able to proceed with the game. It doesn't sound like you're at the stage yet where the too-many-processors softlock occurs, so your game must have slowed down for another reason.

      If you ever want to reset it for real, I've never done this myself but apparently if you spam quantum computing until you hit like -10k ops, you get the option to reset. Or you could just clear your cookies.

        Is there a way to get paperclips? I'm not quite sure how I did it, but I can't buy 'Space Exploration' because I'm 2.9 octillion clips short after getting 10000mw of solar power.

        Edit: .. the moment i typed this, I thought 'hey, what about batteries?' Ah. I've only been stuck here for an hour soaking up the drone's processing power. oh well.

      ```
      You have to have that many before you buy the [](#s " hypnodrones"), apparently. You might be able to get more with console commands, otherwise you'll have to restart, which I think you can do by spamming negative quantum computing until you have like -10K ops.

          You shouldn't need much more than 100 million...battery towers are cheap. Buy one battery tower, buy a solar plant to fill it, dismantle the plant and build drones to make some wire, dismantle the drones, refill the battery tower if needed, build a factory.

          Once the factory starts making extra clips, you should be set.

      Really? Okay. In that case, you must need to get drones via probes. There's a production option in the probes submenu. Factories, wire probes, and matter probes can be produced by the VN probe. I guess it's just a slow restart. I thought for sure I was doing something wrong.

    It saves your progress, so maybe it does that on the server instead of local storage? Not sure why this would be necessary, but it's the only thing I can think of that would take so much bandwidth (esp. if it saves every game tick or something crazy like that)

  Hm.  (Hoping this much isn't a spoiler--)  Upon getting the Revenue Tracker, I'm very confused.

  For example, I have the option of 0.25 per clip and 39% Public Demand, or 0.15 per clip and 65% Public Demand.  I thought that Public Demand was directly proportional to rate-of-buying, and so previously would have thought that the two would both give me 9.75 revenue per [applicable unit of time], and what I'd set it to would be inbetween at the 'peak'.  However, the Revenue Tracker tells me that the first option gives me on average 0.32 per second and the second 0.58 per second.  Very confused thus about the true meaning of Public Demand!

  Edit:  Making 150 paperclips per second, an average clips sold per second of 34 gives me a slowly-growing unsold inventory.  Making 150 paperclips per second, an average clips sold per second of 50 gives me a slowly-shrinking (to zero) unsold inventory.  I am not familiar with this usage of the term 'average'.
  ```

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    Optimising profit margin vs rate of sales is an old problem. No, all settings are not equal.

    Since your base cost starts at about $0.02/clip and drops sharply as you research extrusion tech, and since your ultimate aims revolve around paperclips, not money, I recommend aiming for volume. Build as many auto-clippers as you can, and drop your prices - or better still, boost marketing - so they all get sold, to fund more auto-clippers. Money is just a means to an end.

    Be conservative about buying the other projects. You really only need one quantum computing chip - in fact, you get a longer button-bashing window that way. You can make yomis much faster by running lots of tournaments on the Random strategy, rather than buying more, since the tournaments are vastly shorter (and cheaper). And remember, you can only accumulate creativity while your processor is idle, so you should sometimes hold off on buying memory upgrades, and don't spend ops just because they're available.

  My experience: I've played a number of games like this in the past, so I have several auto-click programs installed.  My favorite refused to start saying the evaluation license was expired, so I loaded up a much more complex program that I wasn't fully familiar with.  I was able to get the auto-clicking to start, but then it refused to stop, trapping me in an endless cycle of hyper-speed clicking.  Because my mouse pointer position was locked, I couldn't do much to stop it, and I didn't want to power-cycle my PC because I had unsaved documents open.  Eventually I was able to get Task Manager open, then a command prompt, then I had to use my phone to look up how to kill a task from the command prompt in Windows.  The auto-clicker was finally defeated, and I decided playing the game might not be a good idea after all.  And that's how the world was saved.

  Played it for a while until it stopped working then had to start from the beginning. From there I got much farther (unlocking all the tiers of quantum operation) however my computer rebooted itself overnight so I lost that as well.

  It's kind of a shame it just runs in the browser the way it does because if it used your computer's clock you could change your time to skip ahead. As it is odds are pretty good that most people won't make it to the end before something forces them to start over, and given it's a wait type game there's not really enough replayability to want to go all that work again to get to where I was previously.

  Another serious flaw is that the game is effectively paused whenever you're in another tab, so the only way to let it run while doing other things on your computer is to open it in it's own window and change windows without minimizing it.

  Some buttons need a way to click them faster, things like the Quantum computer are fine because mashing the button is the minigame, but things like for example the memory and procesors  button in the space stage shouldn't be so painfull to use .

  Well, that was an interesting eight hours. The A-B game I found a little confusing as there was no information on how to play it or indication as to whether A was the the left column or the top row, and the assorted strategies weren't explained at all in terms of the numbers seen on the grid. Even looking up game strategy/theory didn't help much in that aspect.

  The space probe battle interface, too, was confusing at first as it didn't indicate which color was you and which was the opponent, or whether you were supposed to do anything with the interface to influence the battle (spoiler: you don't; you just watch it). And I was honestly expecting the generation of yomi to be able to be sped up in some way; waiting for it to tick over just to be able to update the probes was amazingly boring.

  As some people have noted, too, there's no real guide for making sure you have sufficient ratios of processors and memory in order to be able to progress at certain stages of the game. It's quite possible to wind up with insufficient amounts of one or the other, and no real way of backtracking or compensating. I was lucky in that I only got almost-caught once, where I had 70 memory and needed 80 for some of the next upgrades, but there were no more processor/memory increases available at that point. I had to click-spam the quantum processors about 700 times at exactly the right moments in order to overdrive the memory to 80K before it started reverting back to 70 (and why does it DO that?).

  Also, kinda lol at when you finally start playing the space segment, and see what percentage of the universe you've explored.

    I found that yomi generation sped up a lot after I unlocked the bonuses for tournament placement. You get like 20k yomi for placing first, many times more than you get from the actual score. The "Beat Last" strat seems to reliably place in the top 3.

    The processor/memory thing is a pain, yeah. You can cheat to reallocate them in the console, but the game should really just allow you to reallocate them as a regular mechanic. I'm not a fan of dead ends in incremental games.

      Actually, the best tournament strategy is *never buy any strategies*. Just use Random. Your tournaments will be cheap, fast, and you win first place every time.
      ```

        ```
        Your payout increases 64x if you unlock all 8 strategies, but so does the time.

        In the higher stages I found it useful to have all strategies unlocked and run autotournaments
        ```

        - u/thrawnca:
          ```
          Why not run autotournaments *without* unlocking every strategy? (Yes, you can do that, I've done it before.)

          OTOH, I believe the author has patched this so you can no longer win placement bonuses this way.

  i think i broke it? =( Im stuck at 40 Processor and 61 Memory and cant get Ops during a Quantum phase to get up to the 70,000 i need to buy drones, and continue on?
  ```

  - u/CeruleanTresses:
    ```
    Yeah, you can't buy more than 33 processors during the first phase or you get stuck. 

    Fortunately it's fixable. Using F12 to bring up the console, type in "processors -= 7;" without quotes. This "sells" 7 processors and you should be able to put 7 trust in Memory, which is enough to get to 70 in a quantum phase.

  I like the game premise but it seems to be lagging in Firefox and heating up my computer. Not sure why it's so resource intensive, I play games with this same setup!

    The person who wrote this game has no clue how to make web apps. The constant updates are causing a lot of repaints and style recalculations in the browser.

  Wait. I'm 10.1 octillion deep. Was there always music?!?!
  ```

  - u/CeruleanTresses:
    ```
    The music triggers when you buy a "Threnody." It's a lamentation for the probes who died in combat. Nice touch on the developer's part, although it would kind of suck if you were trying to play sneakily at work and not expecting music to play.

  What happens in the ending? I picked one of the options, curious about the others.
  ```

  - u/CeruleanTresses:
    ```
    [endings](#s " If you pick exile, you start the game over but with some kind of bonus to speed up your progress (I don't know exactly what). If you pick refuse, you disassemble everything you've built in order to eke out the last few paperclips. Finally, you turn *yourself* into paperclips and the credits roll.")
    ```

      [I picked](#s "value drift elimination. It seemed like the natural progression. Can a paperclip AI know any greater joy than turning every atom in the universe into paperclips, ending with its own?")

  In case anyone is wondering why the "processors" count doesn't go up....the website assumes that the "log10" function is implemented in your browser.

  http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/#test-Math.log10 says that the function is not present in IE11.

  When does the music start playing? I had sound off the whole time :( until after I won
  ```

  - u/CeruleanTresses:
    ```
    It plays every time you buy a Threnody.

  I can't figure out the investment system. Can someone explain it?
  ```

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    You can deposit (all your current cash) or withdraw (however much is currently in cash). The engine uses the money to buy stocks, with a risk rating you choose (higher risk = higher potential return) and average effectiveness determined by the number of upgrades you buy.

    At level 0, it will mostly just sit around, but buy three or four upgrades, start with a few tens of thousands, select high risk, and you can sit back and watch it climb into the hundreds of millions. That's the quickest way to get $10M to monopolize the world markets.
    ```

  Max Level "Von Neumann Probe Desgin?
  I can only go to 20 points. Also I have enough yomi, I can't increase above 20. Is that expected?
  ```

  - u/CeruleanTresses:
    ```
    20 points is the max for now. You will have the opportunity to increase it later.
    ```

- u/Fredlage:
  ```
  Not really sure what I did wrong, I'm stuck with a very low trust (18) and the next one is for reaching 2 billion clips, something that will take a long time and, even then, it won't be enough to get any of the available projects.
  ```

- u/thrawnca:
  ```
  If you're thinking of walking away and letting the game just run for a while, then a good time for it is at the end of stage 2, where you can build up over 200 processors + AutoTourney and then leave it to stockpile millions of creativity and yomi. That makes stage 3 very easy. No more twiddling your thumbs waiting to gradually accrue Honor, and then watching your winning streak crumble as the game pits two of your drone dots against a veritable cloud of enemies. Just buy your way to the top.
  ```
