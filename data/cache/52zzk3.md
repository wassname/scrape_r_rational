  Perfectly logical, yes.  ^(*screams quietly under a desk*)

    Indeed.  My first draft of this conversation *did not go well*.  For either of them, really, but far worse for Hermione.  :)

    No worries, she can call on Quirrell for backup! What could *possibly* go wrong with *that* idea?

      I'm ~~surprisingly happy~~ pleased with (and surprised at) how much tension can be introduced even when readers already know nearly everything about the characters. :D
      ```

      - u/daydev:
        ```
        I'd say the tension is present exactly because the readers already know about the character (i.e. dramatic irony). Hermione goes to Quirrell, and the readers go "oh, crap, is she going to tell everything to Voldemort?!".
        ```

      - u/CCC_037:
        ```
        We know enough about the characters to have a much better idea than our protagonist just how far over her head she's getting...
        ```

      absolutely [nothing ](#s "EVERYTHING")

    Not exactly a typo, but it would read better to say 'cages and glass tanks', rather than repeat the word cages.
    ```

    - u/RobinDrew:
      ```
      Thanks, fixed!  It actually is a typo, the second one was supposed to be glass *cases*, and I actually fixed it, but that must've been one of the drafts that didn't survive.
      ```

- u/Achille-Talon:
  ```
  Awesome as ever.

  About portraits (it's a detail, I know, but details is what reddit threads are for), Hermione thinks of them as "sentient if not sapient". Depending on the difference you make between the two words, of course, but it seems to me it is sapient that is 'basic' and sentient that is 'higher', not the other way around.

  Also, why didn't Older Hermione try to stop Hermione from speaking with Quirrell's?

    Thanks!


    > "sentient if not sapient"

    It actually is that way.  Sentient means "feeling", sapient means "reasoning".  Here's a good brief discussion of it with source links -  http://www.rebekkahniles.com/2012/03/word-box-sapience-vs-sentience.html  An easy way to remember is that it's Homo Sapiens, not Homo Sentiens, and humanity is #1 at thinking (at least until 2029, if you lean that way).

    Of course, the way portraits *behave* in canon strongly suggests they *are* sapient - they'd pass true Turing tests with flying colors  (if you got modern ones, anyway) - but that's such an enormous ethical black hole we're forced to hand-wave it away and just say "but they're not" - everyone else certainly doesn't behave as if they have more ethical weight than (non-food) animals.

    > Also, why didn't Older Hermione try to stop Hermione from speaking with Quirrell?

    Good question! ;)

      I see. Well I knew "sentient" meant "feeling" and "sapient" meant "reasoning", but I'd still argue it's in that way. You can make a reasonably well-reasoning computer, but never has a feeling one been made so far. So "sentience" still seems harder to reach than "sapience".

      As for OH-non-intervention theoriesâ€¦ the most obvious guess at this point is that she's already almost entirely "slipped". There is also the possibility that it was never an older Hermione, but an older whoever-else, who has been *pretending* to be Hermione, but is actually not all that unhappy to help past!Voldemort's plans.
