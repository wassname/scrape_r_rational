    That looks *way* cleaner and more to-the-point than what came before.

    The page quote might have more punch if you cut it down to just the first two sentences: "Don't panic. I solemnly swear that there is a logical, foreshadowed, canon-compliant explanation for everything which happens in this chapter."

    Maybe we should distinguish more strongly between [Eliezer's Rational**ist** Fiction](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/1www2h/q_which_is_a_better_name_for_the_tv_tropes_page/cf6zx2v) and the fiction that is discussed in this subreddit (namely, all fiction that is stimulating to an aspiring rationalist's mind). The latter is well suited for discussion in a subreddit but I think the former would fit better in the context of tvtropes.

    I think your proposed rewrite is very well done.

    It looks as good as the last version. I don't really know what the problem is. No one's going to cut it for the time being anyway.
