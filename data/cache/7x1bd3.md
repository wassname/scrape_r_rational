## [D] Monday General Rationality Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics!  Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world?  Have you:

* Seen something interesting on /r/science?
* Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
* Figured out how to become immortal?
* Constructed artificial general intelligence?
* Read a neat nonfiction book?
* Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?

  I want to begin writing out my beliefs (and my reasons for those beliefs, and so on) in order to analyze them more thoroughly, see where there might be some weak points or internal contradictions, etc. 

  Does anyone have any recommendations for going about this in a structured way?

    Find some good books and\or online cources on the history of morality and ethics and study them.

    Also: 1) Download a bunch of [{list of questions to ask your partner before developing a more serous relationship}](https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=questions+to+ask) books → 2) sift through the questions to pick those that pertain to beliefs and opinions (filtering out questions about stuff like childhood memories and the like) → 3) organise the remaining questions by categories → 4) answer them yourself → 5) ??? → 6) Profit!

    Also: same as above, only with political spectrum questionnaires.

    Also: 1) read books \ fanfics in which the protag is an [anti-hero](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero) and\or a [villain](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist); as well as biographies of various historical figure and people in general → 2) note down all of the protag’s decisions throughout the story that you a) wouldn’t have made yourself 2) would’ve been mildly opposed to making 3) would’ve been strongly opposed to making → 3) analyse the reasons behind the protag’s decisions and behind your distaste \ reluctance towards them → 4) scrutinise those reasons \ principles \ decisions to see how accurate they are, etc. → 5) think of some additional ways for making sure that your reasoning in steps #3 and #4 were as accurate as possible → 6A) change your principles — or — 6B) don’t, if you find the results of a bare-logic approach too soul-crushing \ repulsive (this would also be an indicator that you’ve missed some things in steps #3-#5).

    P.s. Share what you’ve manage to find here afterwards, because others will likely be interested in checking the same source materials too.

  So my PI recently nominated me for some interdepartmental fellowship (that comes with a decent $ sum and a nice feather for my cv), and one of its requirements is that I run a multi-day workshop on a topic of my choice that would benefit those on an academic career track. A few friends have gotten this award before, and it seems for me and mine the easy way out is to do an "introduction to scientific computing/statistical inference/git/R/python" type of bootcamp thing. But that seems kinda boring and IDK that I'd personally get a ton out of it.

  Instead, I think I'd like to host a workshop on a subject I've been meaning to delve into for a while now, that of **designing effective slideshow presentations**. For better or worse, keynote/powerpoint/prezi/etc. feature *very* heavily in lectures and presentations in academia, and I'd reckon in many sections of industry too. And when I've taught classes or given talks in the past I've often relied on it extensively (there'll be lab components/demonstrations that take up maybe a quarter of class time, and discussions of papers and stuff that take up another quarter, but maybe half the time it's me walking around up front using slides as visual aids and trying to stimulate discussion). While I like to think I have a good eye for design and for the visual presentation of data etc., I've never actually had any formal schooling in the matter and mostly just made slides off of intuition. I've also sat through a ton of talks from ugrads, grad students, and professors featuring absolutely dreadful slides. Presumably they intuited their way to those slides too (or just dgaf).

  So **what sorts of principles of design actually maximize learning outcomes, information retention, student enjoyment, teaching effectiveness**, etc. etc. especially according to the empirical literature? What practices are demonstrably superior? (and what's good for the goose may not for the gander if there are between-student, between-department, between-culture, between-sex, etc. differences).  Some quick googling gives me lots of papers [e.g. [1](http://www.ijikm.org/Volume6/IJIKMv6p085-094Brock545.pdf), [2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187712971530006X), [3](http://www.academicradiology.org/article/S1076-6332\(17\)30189-7/abstract), [4](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10755-016-9381-8), [5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131515300695), [6](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2014.01138/full), [7](http://www.ijikm.org/Volume6/IJIKMv6p085-094Brock545.pdf)...] and general style guides [e.g. [1](https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/making-better-powerpoint-presentations/#resources), [2](http://www.uq.edu.au/teach/resources/beyond-bullets-web.pdf)], and there are ofc broader works relating to information design and data visualization, like Tufte's books, but having not done any more than a cursory overview of this field I was wondering if any here could lend their guidance and expertise.

  edit: whoops, awkward title, but y'all get the gist

  just watched a short video online of a talk given last year by an old colleague/friend and thought it might be of interest to some here -- [Bayesian Statistics without Frequentist Language](https://youtu.be/yakg94HyWdE). As stated at the start it is *quite* non-technical, but I still think might be a little hard to get through if you don't have at minimum a very basic understanding of Bayesian inference in the context of regression models (and if you're moderately familiar IDK that you'd get too much out of the talk). Not sure how on board I am with the closing "modest proposal" either, but I guess someone needs to be among the first to move against the tide of linguistic inertia? (and he of course mentions the obvious caveats, e.g. you can still obtain point estimates from the joint posterior given some loss function)
