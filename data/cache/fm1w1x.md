## Fantasy or science fiction with a utilitarian hero?

### Post:

Hi! I hope this counts as on-topic. I have a question.

Most fiction hates utilitarianism. When the hero is presented with a trolley problem, more than 9 times out of 10 the hero will refuse to sacrifice anyone and instead dons his plot armour and saves everyone. A character who thinks in utilitarian terms is either a villain or a silly naysayer who gets proven wrong.

I hate that.

So can you name any fantasy or science fiction that shows utilitarianism in a positive light, or at least doesn't demonize it?

The best examples I can think of:

* Tamas from Brian McClellan's _Powder Mage_ trilogy (willing to kill a lot of innocents to get rid of the bad regime).
* Reinhard von Lohengramm from _Legend of the Galactic Heroes_ (Japanese novel, anime).
* Arguably Lelouch from _Code Geass_ (anime).

EDIT: Also Frank Herbert's _Dune_.

  I hope it isn't tacky to self rec.  I write The Fifth Defiance.  (link: [https://thefifthdefiance.com/2015/11/02/introduction/](https://thefifthdefiance.com/2015/11/02/introduction/))

  It's a story about a world where there is a super person reigning as dictator, and all attempts to straightforwardly rise up against her regime have failed.  The protags are collaborators, attempting to work from within the system to bring it down.

  The necessity or lack thereof of utilitarian tradeoffs is pretty central to the various dilemmas that they face.  I dunno, I think I can at least give myself points for 'doesn't demonize it'.

  It's pretty long too, so if you turn out to be able to get some enjoyment out of it, you should probably be good for a few days.

  If you are fine with webfiction i can recommend practical guide to evil, its really long though. If you like superman i can recommend [The Metropolitian Man](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10360716/1/The-Metropolitan-Man) which focuses on Lex Luthers attempts to kill superman and his motivations for doing so, which are hardcore utilitarian.
  ```

  - u/archpawn:
    ```
    I feel like Practical Guide to Evil ignores the fact that hell literally exists in that universe. Catherine seems to only care about this life.

    Also, Metropolitan Man seems like it might be more about a possible failure state. Lex was so concerned about the dangers of Superman that he didn't worry about what else might be out there, and now he'll likely be stuck fighting Brainiac without help from someone with superpowers.

      You may want to check out [Unsong](http://unsongbook.com/). The premise is that Jewish myths are real, as is the judeochristian hell. Without spoiling, this is a major theme that certainly does not go ignored. Peter Singer is referenced as an early figure in the fight against Hell and there are some definite instances of the sort of tricky utilitarian decisions you're looking for.
      ```

        Since I found Unsong a slog to read through most of the time, [I will link to the relevant chapter, the one describing hell](http://unsongbook.com/interlude-%D7%99-the-broadcast/). Can be read as a standalone interlude, and is really good.
        ```

    - u/Pel-Mel:
      ```
      To be fair though, the Hells we know of aren't really designated afterlifes, at least, none that we've seen. They seem more like dimensional homes for devils and demons rather than any kind of karmic punishment. Whatever the afterlife for Villains is, even Cat hasn't gotten to see it.

      Edit: As a matter of fact, considering that >!Kairos got applause from the Gods Below when he died!< seems to indicate that the Gods Below might actually have rewards for their best adherents just like Above. Pragmatically speaking, you've got to motivate loyalty somehow.

        We don't know much as far as I've read (book 4 chapter 13), but that's exactly the issue. She should be putting a lot more effort into learning about that.

      >  ignores the fact that hell literally exists in that universe

      Not really.

      >!IIRC part of hell was literally invaded and taken over. So Hell isn't some undefeatable force as long as you have the right Story backing you up. Also they've acknowledged that different Heaven and Hells exists, same goes for the Fae. It basically boils down to what you/your people believe. Also apparently the Gnomes are more powerful than Heaven/Hell since their threat of Exterminatus keeps them from developing certain tech.!<
      ```

      - u/archpawn:
        ```
        It's possible that they start worrying about it eventually, but in the books I've read Catherine seems to be far more worried about everyone's first life. She didn't join Black to take over hell. She did it to improve the living conditions in Callow.
        ```

        - u/Ardvarkeating101:
          ```
          There’s a major misconception here.  The afterlife is not “The Hells.”  The Hells are parallel universes filled with raining blood and psychopathic monsters called devils.  The afterlife is a complete unknown.  There are tons of beliefs about what it is, and people have come back from it with their souls intact, but their memories are always wiped.  WoG is that they differ based on beliefs, but we don’t actually know if being an awful person sees you punished by the Gods Above or rewarded by the Gods Below.
          ```

      ```
      Well Catherine is big on (self )sacrifice, so I don’t think she cares very much about her own eternal Damnation.
      Also Huge spoilers !
      ```

      - u/archpawn:
        ```
        I don't mean just her damnation. I don't mean to say that everything she's doing is damning everyone around her. Just that she's put little to no thought into what will happen to them after they die and instead focuses on making mortality better. Focusing on that infinitely thin sliver of their life is absurd.

  Juniper from Worth The Candle isn't strictly utilitarian, but he has certainly gone pretty far in the whole ends justify the means thing. He has sent innocent people to the hells in the hopes that eventually he'll be powerful enough to destroy them.

  The Tau from Warhammer 40k come to mind, but I don't know enough about the lore to say how much they're demonized. Though they must be at least a little, given that they even exist in that universe.
  ```

  - u/SpectrumDT:
    ```
    Thanks. "Worth the Candle" is a _Dungeons and Dragons_-eqsue isekai?
    ```

    - u/Geminii27:
      ```
      Yep. There's a lot of worldbuilding discussion woven in and around the central plot; Juniper is basically an experienced and creative DM who is dropped into a world that seems to be at least partially based on several of the worlds he made up over the years (which in turn drew heavily on classic DnD manuals).

      Except that he's not the first Earth human to have ended up there, and the deeper he goes, the more everything seems to point to the Lost King...

      It does keep things relatively fresh by having the game interface elements be only one part of the overall story, and while they start off relatively straightforward (and are actively used as Chekov's Guns a few times), they fade into the background a little as the story proper develops more complexity. It's also one of the few Gamer isekais where the protagonist gains companions which are, in at least one case, notably *smarter* than him and actively give suggestions about how to explore and munchkin the interface (and push it towards particular goals).

      I should add that the character of Amaryllis (the aforementioned companion) is probably even *more* utilitarian than Juniper. She has a very political background in a fairly red-in-tooth-and-claw noble society, and has absolutely no compunction about killing people in cold blood if that would be the most useful thing to do.
      ```

  ```
  Not an answer to your question, but I have to disagree with Reinhardt as a utilitarian hero, especially compared to characters like Oberstein.  Reinhardt was no less focused on his image and being seen as a hero than he was on actually unifying the galaxy.  See the Westerland incident for a perfect example of what I mean.
  ```

  - u/SpectrumDT:
    ```
    Fair enough. I don't know the whole story. So far I've only watched the 2010s anime, not the older anime nor the books.

  Baru Cormorant in the Masquerade series. The Masquerade are a colonial expansionist empire that economically and culturally invade Baru’s island home, and she decides to work from within to help her family, her people. It has legitimately interesting application of economics in the story too! And has a gut wrenching emotional core.

    - u/tvcgrid:
      ```
      Yeah, having read book 2 also (and agonizingly waiting for book 3 this year), it doesn’t have much magic. I’d describe it as ‘hard fantasy’ — and the author relates concepts to real historical stuff in a great way; in other words, there’s a conscious interest in making things seem very real and grounded. But hey, where else do you get an exciting protagonist who’s a freaking accountant (there’s more to Baru than that, don’t worry lol)

  Many (or just some) of the fics in the reddit wiki have utilitarianism as a thing, so check those out if you hadn't already.

  A pretty good one not on the list is [Isekai Speedrun](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21107/isekai-speedrun), where the world is post-apocalyptic and the characters morally dark. Pretty interesting worldbuilding as well, I think.

  Not exactly what you're looking for, since the story does attempt to imply he was wrong, but I have a feeling you'd really enjoy the character Emiya Kiritsugu from the Fate/Zero anime and light novel.

  Also: Amaryllis from Worth the Candle.
  ```

  - u/SpectrumDT:
    ```
    IMO Emiya Kiritsugu is a horror example of the opposite. He is a strawman utilitarian. The plot goes out of its way to dishonestly stack the odds against his philosophy and make him look wrong and pave the way for his stupid, plot-armoured son to look heroic. Of all the tepid philosophy I've seen in Nasu Kinoko's works, this bit is the worst.

    Thanks, though. :)

      >The plot goes out of its way to dishonestly stack the odds against his philosophy and make him look wrong and pave the way for his stupid, plot-armoured son to look heroic.

      To be fair it's also pretty clear that >!Shiro's heroism is naïve and he eventually comes to regret his ideals.!< I think that story does a pretty good job of not picking one philosophy over others, but rather exploring the positives and negatives of several different worldviews without trying to claim one is better than others. You don't get competing worldviews with one coming out on top, you get worldviews struggling against their own internal inconsistencies.

  Well, in *Wizard's First Rule* by Terry Goodkind, the heroes have a discussion in which they say that their mission to keep the MacGuffin away from the Evil Overlord is more important than any of them, so they agree that if one of them gets captured and held hostage, they won't give up the MacGuffin no matter what.

  I found the first two books in the Sword of Truth series to be very good, but it starts taking a serious nosedive in quality starting with the third book, eventually descending into Ayn Rand worshipping madness. The worst part is the disgusting eighth book, *Naked Empire*, which explicitly reverses some of the morality discussed in previous books. In the first book, it's discussed how killing is always a tragedy, because even the life of an enemy has value, and the most dangerous thing in the world is someone utterly convinced of the rightness of their own cause, because they'll be capable of anything. In the eighth book, the moral is that some things really are as simple as black and white, that some things really are just Evil and that there is nothing bad whatsoever about killing people that support Evil. :/

  1) Ozymandias in Watchmen, there's strong arguments both for and against his actions. In the very beginning, Rorshach talks about how Truman deploying the A-bomb saved more people than it killed, which sets up Ozymandias's actions. Are three million people worth it to save billions both now and in the future? And will his noble lie even lead to a lasting peace?

  2) Deus Ex and Fallout both can be played with a utilitarian worldview that leads to multiple endings. In New Vegas I support the NCR because it leads to the greatest good in both the short term and the long term by establishing a functioning democracy.

  Prisoners of Power by brothers Strugatsky. It's hard to give a pitch without spoiling too much, but the plot boils down to this. Maxim, a posthuman from a communist utopia crash-lands on a post nuclear war planet, and the conditions are not great, not terrible. The protag is Superman lite. No flight or laser eyes, but impervious to radiation and vastly superior to the natives in every metric. From there Max, decidedly not an utilitarian, works to fix the local dystopia. And fails.

  Oh, and how come Dune isn't on your list.

- u/LLJKCicero:
  ```
  The protagonist in **Practical Guide to Evil**, as well as her mentor are both kind of utilitarian "villains".

  Catherine is nominally on the side of Evil, but in practice often seems good-er than the heroes on the side of Good.

  For utilitarianism, there was recently a plot point revolving around reacting to a highly infectious, deadly disease by either >!praying to the Gods Above for salvation, vs containment followed by killing people who tried to escape quarantine.!< Acting on faith vs taking pragmatic but ruthless action.

  I do have another webfiction and this one is nearly one of the longest books in the english language. [Worm](https://parahumans.wordpress.com/) . Basically if superheroes/villains actually made sense characterwise. Warning though, it is VERY graphic in everything from violence to the R-word. But taylor ,the main character, is very pragmatic.

    My biggest problem with Worm ended up being a practical one. I had a hard time keeping all the names, nicknames and powers straight. I made little cheat sheets for myself to avoid spoilers but it didn't help much. I'd be in situations where the author *clearly* was doing something clever or subtle and I'd be at a complete loss because I had no clue who or what was implied in the text.

    "A slithering glint of gun metal flashed past the window and Taylor had a sinking sensation that an old foe was upon her..."

    Meanwhile I'm scrambling to think back 460 chapters to that one fight she had with a metal snake... Or was it a tinker with a tentacle weapon...

- u/CronoDAS:
  ```
  L.E. Modesitt Jr. has heroes that generally have a utilitarian bent, frequently choosing to use magic or advanced technology to cause large scale destruction in order to make sure that defeated enemies can never pose a threat again. This is taken to an extreme in *The Ethos Effect* in which the hero observes that a civilization is about to become an Evil Empire and destroys it (using a device that causes what appears to be a massive natural disaster) *before* it can become a threat to everyone else.
  ```

- u/CronoDAS:

  *Watchmen* might be a good example?

  ```
  OK not gonna call it rational but it was damn funny.

  So last night I read LORD DOOM, where Taylor wants to become a hero, but she figures she needs to fund her tinkering first so she creates a disposable alter ego to steal some funds.

  The protagonist of Ward just tried to >!hopefully save the world by unleashing a virus that would have killed all Capes, and hopefully fucked up the Entities' data storage scheme!<, so that was pretty utilitarian of her, but for most of the rest of the book she was pretty set against the utilitarian mindset in general.

  Ringworld engineers by Larry Niven features at its core classic utilitarian calculations. Probably better to read "ringworld" before. Standard Niven disclaimers apply.
