## Interest check for a story

### Post:

I'd like to interest-check a story that I'm writing for NaNo.

This paste of the preface and first chapter will be up for a week: https://pastebin.com/VPUjv0VH

I'm not that big a fan of the style this is turning out to be written in (hopefully that parses) and I could write a whole long paragraph about how much it is going to and already does suck, but I'm more interested in knowing if people on /r/rational would be interested in... a serialization of the month's end-product, I guess?

That's a lot of words to say "would you want to read more of this", I guess. Oh, and also "what do you like / not like / feel grabbed by / feel turned-off by in this first chapter".

Thank you for whatever feedback you feel like giving!
(... he said, feeling really embarrassed about posting this.)

PS: Please ignore the continuity error. I haven't decided which way to fix it yet.

  I think you're assuming too much about the reader understanding Jewish cultural traditions around coming of age and the Torah.

  I'd encourage you to post as the month goes on.  It's good to get more stories.

  Structurally, you've given me a few hooks, any of which could start the story:

  * How does a software consultancy literally explode?
  * How did his personal life explode
  * Dragon?
  * Religious debate?
  * What's up with the politics?
  * Move?

  One sticking point is that I'm not sure if the political stuff is an unreliable narrator, if it's authorial hints about the tone of the book, or if it's signaling that we're in an alternate US.

  Take the insurance.  Standard home owners insurance covers losses from fire and mundane criminal acts. It might not cover damage from exceptional things like war, terrorism, or Godzilla.   So, if the insurance company says that the bombing was just a crazy guy, then the damages should be covered immediately.

  And transition teams haven't been able to fire career civil servants since the [Pendleton act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Civil_Service_Reform) passed in 1883.

    Which of these hooks interests you more vs less?

    I must not be being clear about the insurance! You're 100% right, which is the point; the narrator cannot argue that it was terrorism lest the damages have been invalid (because the damage wasn't covered). Having to pay it back no matter how long it's been is narrative license, no insurance contract would be structured that way in real life, but I thought it was funny.

    Narrator's mom is in State and serves at the pleasure of the President, though she's been there since Reagan (e.g., stayed through two two-term Democratic Presidents). "You're fired as soon as we're in office, but you're not allowed to say anything about it" kind of dealio. She's based off of a couple of real people.

      I'm conflicted on the political stuff.  

      As written, it's a strong turn-off for me, and the details are a bit jarring.  But I suspect I'm not in the target audience.  So, if you're going to be writing a book with strong political themes, it's probably good to set the tone at the start.

      If you're going to focus on the impact of the bombing, and it's long-term fallout, I might *also* have the main character be injured from getting jumped.  Since he's a software developer, losing an (insured) office just isn't that big of deal.

      Otherwise, I'd focus on the dragon.

  You got my interest at

  > a meticulously planned bombing of my office

  and then promptly lost it by talking about anything but.
