## [RT] Lain's Number - Prologue - 1,522 words

[Link to story](https://www.reddit.com/r/WeirdEmoKidStories/comments/5ketfd/wp_you_found_a_number_that_can_truly_answer_any/)

A young man finds a number that can truly answer any question through a SMS. Over the next day he uses it to his advantage, until he decides to message "What happens after you die?". Anything else would spoil the chapter.

I've been working on this story since late December. It started as a writing prompt that got a lot of positive feedback, and people wanted to see what happened next, so I kept writing it. I figured some of you might like it, even though it's kinda hard to pin down what genre it is at the beginning. I'm even planning a "Rationality Training Arc" down the road. At the rate I'm going, I'm posting two chapters a month. Now that I'm finishing the first arc, the chapters will come out faster. Hope you guys like it!

  The lack of munchinism of the main character is making me  uncomfortable , he didn't even won the lottery yet. Even if he really can't think about all the things that he could be asking( how I can cure cancer, what dangers I will probably face today,,how to prove Riemann hypothesis,  is p  =np, how to win money , how to improve his skills........)he could  ask "What  should I ask you?". It's like if you gave someone cheat codes for a game and they used the give whatever it in you want code to get weapons slightly better than their current level.(edited)

    There's a reason why he hasn't asked "What should I ask you?", but I can't really say much more without spoiling stuff. Of course he hasn't won the lottery. He doesn't need a lot of money yet (the blog makes enough for him to have decent spending money), he doesn't want to even risk drawing attention to himself, and there's way more efficient methods of abusing the number to make money. I'm sure someone out there can give me a compelling reason for why this is a retarded decision on my part, but that's my reasoning.

    As far as all the things Emmett could be doing right now, he's pretty much focused on ruling the world before distributing any cancer cures. I don't know if this classifies as a spoiler, but one of his plans is to create friendly AI that can take care of that. It's just that he lacks the technical knowledge to do it at the moment.

    *didn't even win

    *"What should I ask you?" (You're using quotes, so it was clearly meant to be direct speech.)

      I don't think Kuriatus should be downvoted here, he's not being an asshole and being corrected is helpful to people learning English (which crivtox likely is).

        Exactly, I don't mind if he corrects me , even if I wasn't learning English it wouldn't matter anyway because reddit has an edit button so it's not like changing it  it's a tremendous effort.If he was nitpicking everything it could be annoying , but this error was significant enough to let kodix deduce I 'm learning english , and it's not the kind of error the autocorrector can solve ,so I would have kept repeating it.

  Hmm. I like the premise, and I *really* like the "twist", but I don't like where you go from there. It doesn't feel like he's taking both the ability and and twist seriously. The parts you show seem to be more about, well, college drama - relatively unimportant given his "super power" - and the parts that you imply ("going into medicine, going to help a lot of people" implies asking the super power science questions) are where I'd consider him taking this seriously.

  I do want to reiterate how much I love the twist. That's pretty excellent, actually. The more I think about it, the more amazing it becomes; the more level is works on. It's pretty genius.

  You should check out a book called "Sophie's World". That book may be why I don't think your MC is taking his situation seriously.

  I have a lot more I can say, if you want it.

    Thanks for the feedback! I hope you don't mind if I explain my choices here. Emmett's first character arc *is* realizing that he isn't taking everything as seriously as he could. He's cocky. He thinks he's just bound to win because of his protagonist status. Of course, he's not actively thinking this. I wanted to start with a smaller scale conflict in part because I'm still learning to write and because I want a big contrast between the early parts of the story and the later ones. I don't want to sit here and defend my writing, though. I realize I'm still an amateur. Pretty much everything about this story could be better, but I can only fix that with experience. 

    Oh and thanks for the book recommendation! I'm definitely checking it out.

  I enjoyed reading so far but although I'm an anime fan myself I think there are way too many explicit references. 

  Although it's not unrealistic for people to be referring to Anime since I do that with my friends all the time, it just feels weird when people dress and act like Anime even though everyone clearly lives in America and mostly acts as such. 

  Also please put it somewhere other than reddit threads because getting to the last chapter every time is a pain, I'd love to be able to follow it more easily
