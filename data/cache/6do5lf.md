## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  A two parter:

  1. You have the ability to roll back time by five minutes. You can use this power at will, but can never go back further than five minutes; if you have seen 09:15, then everything before 09:10 is forever beyond your abilities, though you can still repeat the period from 09:10 to 09:15 as many times as you wish. If you die, time will roll back automatically until it reaches its limit. How do you use this power to maximize your values?

  2. You are pursuing the person from 1. You know the ins and outs of their ability, and further have the ability to sense their location to within 1 mile whenever they use their power. How do you incapacitate and capture them into the foreseeable future, with the knowledge that they can try any five minute long line of argument against you and repeatedly make escape attempts?
  ```

  - u/arenavanera:
    ```
    I think there are two approaches to (1):

    * Try and figure out how the time travel effect works.  If you remember things after moving back in time, that suggests it can either change the state of matter in the past (since your brain is different), or that cognition doesn't happen in the brain.  Either one would be very exciting.
    * Acquire resources using the stock market, pump the money into whatever the highest-value activity is (AI research?).

    It would probably also be wise to take breaks every so often to sit in front of a computer and read for a very long time.  (If you can get to where you left off in <5 minutes, you can read and learn things forever.)  You'd probably start to go a little batty from lack of human contact if you did this for too long, although you could mitigate that with either drugs or occasional interactions with strangers on the Internet.  If you get old enough, and the AI research isn't panning out, you might want to try and do this forever as a form of pseudo-immortality.

    I think the key to (2) would be to just knock them unconscious (assuming that stops them from voluntarily going back in time).  You could keep them unconscious or drugged while they're captured as well.

    If you need to interrogate them while they're captured, I think you'd probably still be pretty safe.  Physical escape attempts aren't particularly worrying if you have time to prepare their cage while they're unconscious/drugged.  There's a certain level of physical restraint that no amount of being clever can get around -- straight jackets, iron manacles, locked rooms deep underground, severed spinal cords, and so on.

    Psychological escape attempts are a bit harder.  I think the trick is to make attempting to escape unpleasant so that they aren't willing to do it millions of times in a row without a break.  Torture would probably be effective: if every interrogation session is painful, they'll want it to end as soon as possible, and definitely won't be willing to repeat it millions of times.

    Does person one have the ability to roll back time while they are unconscious? Otherwise it's pretty easy, sneak up while they are sleeping, drug them, put them in a jail cell. By the time they wake up, way more than 5 minutes will have passed.
    ```

    - u/alexanderwales:
      ```
      For the sake of argument we'll say that time rolls back when they're unconscious only if you kill them.

      But the problem is that they *know* they're vulnerable while sleeping, and that being slipped a drug that takes longer than five minutes to show its effects is one of their failure conditions, so they presumably have taken measures to mitigate these (for example, never drinking something that hasn't been pulled from a random pool by them or unsealed in their presence, hiring private security to guard them while they sleep, setting up alarm systems if anyone enters their room at night, etc.).

      Ideally, you'd first come up with the protocol you'd use to guard yourself knowing your abilities and vulnerabilities, then think about how you would go about defeating that protocol.
      ```

      - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
        ```
        If the person from (1) is sufficiently paranoid, the person from (2) won't be able to do anything.

        Why? Because (1) will NEVER stop looping the same 5 minutes, repeating the same actions, ad infinitum. Boring yes, but that is the only way to be safe from (2).

        If (1) is not that paranoid, then there are any number of ways for (2) to bypass (1)'s security, e.g. seduction or being hired as the private security.
        ```

        - u/alexanderwales:
          ```
          Looping the same five minutes seems like a really poor way for (1) to satisfy their values, unless their only value is continued existence with no new experiences.
          ```

  - u/CCC_037:
    ```
    (1): It's very easy to win vast amounts of money on short-term gambling. Roulette wheels are probably good - anything where the result comes almost immediately. One can also have fun with appearances on game shows - preferably the sort where there's either a limited number of answers (possibly a multiple-choice scenario), or where the answers are revealed after you get it wrong (but less then five minutes after you give your answer).

    --------------

    Now that I have an arbitrary amount of money (and have probably been banned from every casino on the continent - they might not know how I do it, but they have certainly spotted that they lose a lot of money to me) I can look into satisfying those values that are not satisfied by merely being obscenely rich. I guess I could be incredibly petty and say the most insulting things to people I don't like - then rewind, smile, and nod, and be diplomatic. This gives me both the short-term satisfaction of blowing my top and the long-term satisfaction of appearing to be in excellent control of my temper. (I've just got to make sure my rant never passes the five minute mark).

    I can also do risky things with immediate payoff. If I am, for example, ever in a situation where there is a large bomb in front of me and I know that it can be defused by cutting the right wire but will kill me if I cut the wrong one - well, then I'm not going to end up in a timeline in which I cut the wrong wire. (I need to be careful, though - a bomb which knocks me out and maims me severely on the wrong wire-cut is bad news). Now, I don't intend to take on a career in bomb disposal - but I can certainly start to react five minutes before things go wrong, which is an advantage in all sorts of careers (as a doctor or a policeman, this puts me on the scene where basically five-minute precognition can come in really, really handy - not that I need to work, but I might find fulfillment in helping people in some way).

    I an also pump people for information. If I go up to someone and say "Your bank code is 0000", they will shrug me off. Rewind. "Your bank code is 0001." Rewind. "Your bank code is 0002.". Rewind - eventually, he'll respond with shock and "how did you know?" Rewind again. That was tedious, but now I know his bank code and he doesn't know I know it. (Okay, I have arbitrary amounts of money, so I don't need random stranger's bank codes. But I can get similar information out of people by similar strategies if I want, and if I have the patience - I could for example do a seriously convincing mind-reader act on stage).

    --------------

    Looping the same five minutes with a good internet connection means I can read arbitrary amounts of information on near any subject in only five minutes real time. Always useful. Pity I can't keep notes while doing it. (I mean, I can always reset, write a note, and then only reset to after the note - that causes the entire study session to take more than five minutes, though).

    Actually, this will look kind of odd to anyone watching - I open a browser, then immediately write down a bunch of (completely accurate) notes without looking up anything, then turn off the computer. It looks like I don't need it, but I do.

    ...in fact, given that I have a search engine on my phone, I could look up anything, reset back to before the lookup, and give the impression that I have all the answers in my head. (But I lose my omnidisciplinary answers as soon as I can't get a cellphone signal, which is going to annoy everyone else because they never see me look things up on my phone anyway so why do I need a signal?)

    --------------

    (2) There's an important point to consider here. What do I want to do with this guy when I get him?

    Depending on my aim:

    - Kill him: Hire an assassin, a sniper. Inform him that he must, under any and all circumstances, observe the target for five minutes by the clock before pulling the trigger. Payment is only for a successful kill. (The assassin will get rather frustrated at the target's apparent ability to suddenly duck into a building or similar the moment he is spotted, but eventually he'll get caught with no five-minute escape).

    - Imprison him. If I have legal authority to do so, then I will use this legal authority - after waiting five minutes just outside his estate so he cannot lock it down and get out without running into the people I have watching all the exits. If I do not have legal authority, then it gets trickier - but still, my aim is to make sure taht he has no escape five minutes *before* he has any chance to notice that anything's wrong. I might also take a hostage - someone close to him - and then wait a good five minutes before contacting him to arrange the ransom.

    - I wish to ask him to use his power to my benefit in some way. I will simply find a way to send him a request and ask politely. If he is willing to help, then I have succeeded in my aim. If not, then see imprisonment (above).

      With your guessing of the PIN number, wouldn't it be easier to just watch them input it? cause if their number is 9899 brute-forcing could take a verrrry long time. Then, even if you get caught, just rewind. I think it would be easier to figure out someone's pin from watching them press the buttons, or even if you couldn't manage that you could at least watch their hand movement (if it moves left and down it's probably a 4 5 7 or 8 for example) and then brute force the possible combinations after that

  - u/Gurkenglas:
    ```
    1. Presumably, memories are transmitted. What about brain damage? Acquire a button that kills me if I let go of it, in order to guard against unconsciousness. What happens if I overdose on sleeping pills? A computer that kills me in my sleep repeatedly can get very close to an NP oracle, to be applied, for example, to mining bitcoins, though the psychological effects of subjectively sleeping for a long, long time might be discouraging.

    (1) Amass stupid amounts of money via gambling, followed by hiring/buying ridiculous amounts of security so the guy from (2) can't kill me.

    (2) This really isn't that hard. Person from (1) manipulates time, but can't actually go without sleeping. Since you can sense (1)'s location, you can just stalk (1) until (1) sleeps, then kidnap (1). (1) captured! If you're having problems stalking (1), try befriending (1) instead, or try getting hired as a bodyguard for (1) if (1) starts buying lots of security. 

    Also, you can get just as much money as (1), since you know exactly where he is and can bet the same things as he does, assuming you don't start much poorer than him or something.

    Once you kidnap (1) and bring him to some secure inescapable hideout, you're done. Only problem left is keeping the hideout inescapable. But honestly something as simple as a prison cell would work, prisoners spend years in them without any way to get out other than using super slow methods like digging tunnels or grinding bars. Going back 5 minutes in time won't do (1) any good.
    ```

  - u/EthanCC:
    ```
    For (2), set a bomb or other trap, somewhere you know (1) will be, wait five minutes from when they are in the optimal position, or activate it as soon as they try to escape (probably from that position). It will go off after five minutes, they reset, try to escape, and you set it off. If the trap is good enough there is no way for them to escape, eventually they will get bored and give up. The Sans strategy, basically.

  So I was reading a novel where a modern day guy is given the opportunity to be sent to a fantasy world with pre-medieval technology. (No glass, no steel) The queen wants his bloodline as his parents escaped from the fantasy world to our modern one, but wars and some unique bloodline magic has made him an important commodity. He's not expected to do any work other than make babies in a country with a hot and humid climate and no winter. He's given thirty days and has $25,000 USD before he is summoned to the fantasy world for the next thirty years. He can bring with him anything within a 10 foot cube.

  Now, in the story, the guy is politically savvy and actually helps out with politics a little. But completely useless at advancing his new found country in almost everywhere. With his preparation, he brought a hydro electrical generator, a fridge filled with perishable goods, a TV with DVD player and a variety of entertainment shows, a desktop computer with a word processor and excel, some alcohol, and an air conditioner.

  So basically he lives in relative modern luxury as royalty, with a queen that feels guilty about making him abandon our modern world. And has done nothing to make his adopted country better in anyway other than sharing a bit of knowledge like Arabic numerals, double-entry accounting, and gear cogs should have co-prime teeth. 

  In his place you, given the exact same circumstances, now have two goals:

  -Maintain whatever modern comforts you bring for as long as possible.

  -Improve your adopted country (technologically, culturally).


  What do you bring for $25,000 USD that can fit in a 10 foot cube, given thirty days prep?

    You might find [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3a66h4/dbst_you_have_2_days_to_prepare_to_transport_to_a/) of interest, because although the circumstances are different, it would follow some of the same pathways. Adapting my answer from there:

    * Get a bunch of older e-readers with e-ink displays that don't drain battery.
    * Get a few low power netbooks.
    * Download copies of Simple English Wikipedia, a wide selection of material from Gutenberg, and as many books as possible about pre-Medieval and Medieval technical advances.
    * Get a few different ways of generating moderate amounts of power (e.g. hand cranks).
    * Get a bunch of cords for your electronics.
    * Get high-quality paper versions of books that cover the most important subject matter.

    Everything else is whatever you'd consider "essential" to modern luxury. Personally, I'm a good enough cook that I probably wouldn't need to bring along any food, just maybe some durable pots, pans, and knives (and sharpeners) to make more modern cooking easier. Air conditioning and refrigeration in general are problematic technologies, because they'd be nearly impossible to fix and you'd need a ton of technology in order to get the refrigerants they needed if there was ever a failure or leak - 30 years is a long time for a modern appliance. I guess I would head to my local camping store and look at what they had in the way of high durability, low maintenance camping equipment, most of which is designed for emulating luxury in the wilderness.

      > I'm a good enough cook that I probably wouldn't need to bring along any food

      You totally would, most of the common foods are a mish-mash from all over the world. I'd probably bring a few hardy chilli plants - spices were almost non-existent, and chillis are easy to grow and propagate. They spread like wildfire through Europe and Asia after they were discovered in South America.

      Depending on the climate, seeds and seedlings for things like pepper, cinnamon, cumin, etc. Definitely would want some herbs like cilantro and whatnot too. 

      I'm *really into* good food so moving to a medieval world would be like, my worst fear because of the lack of spices and ingredients. Like, the foods even the poorest people (in a developed country) have access to today are beyond what the kings of yore would have had. Pineapples were once so expensive that people used to rent them to display at parties as a curiosity.

  In a LitRPG setting, one of the players gets a skill that allows him to challenge any non-monster. An "Equalizer" for lack of a better name.(suggestions are welcome :))
  For the duration of the challenge the players stats will become the same as his opponent stats. If the player wins he gets to keep the stats.

  -1-The player can't challenge more than one person at a time.

  -2-Only sapient species such as humans, elves,dwarves, etc can be challenged. Anything too different from human(lizardmen, demons, etc) won't work.

  -3-To challenge the player must lock eyes with his opponent.

  -4-Once challenged the individual will automatically try to kill the player. 

  -5-The affects last as long as both are alive or are in ~1km range of each other.

  -6-It's possible to resist the homicidal affect but the challenge will be automatically lost.

  -7-The player is currently dead set on not killing no matter the reasons.(I'm still debating with myself if this includes death-row prisoners as well, but for now the option is off the table.)

  The question:


  Is there a way to leverage this without killing anyone? 

  *Don't know why the numbers don't go in order... everything looks fine until I post.


  Ex.:

  For the player to gain the stats from his opponent, the opponent must die. 

  So if A(10str 20int) and challenges B(20str,10int), for the duration of the match A has 20str 10int as well. If A kills B they will from the moment of B's death have 20 str 10 int.

  If B kills A then nothing changed. The individual challenged gains nothing from the challenge.

  To designate a challenge to B, A must lock eyes with B. (Picture/drawing/reflection won't work.) So to start a challenge A must be no more than ~100m from B.

  Once the challenge started however, if A and B are more than ~1km apart the challenge is lost.

  A gains/loses nothing. 
  B no longer wants to kill A.


  The homicidal feeling is a sudden growing rage to hurt A as much as possible physically.
  The rage grows stronger as the challenge progresses giving a a little time for B to notice that maybe the rage isn't rational and try to resist by force of will. Most people won't be able to do it without a very high Willpower stat, as the affect of the challenge give B pleasure for any pain(physical or magical) inflicted on A by B.

  If B manages to resist the effect the challenge ends and the anger goes away immediately.
  A gains nothing.

  For A to win and gain the stats permanently he must kill B by himself. (Poison counts but hiring an assassin doesn't)
  ```

  - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
    ```
    I see, thanks for clarifying the question. In short: you are looking for a way to exploit this ability without winning any challenges. There are a number of uses.

    Most prominently, the fact that this makes you a giant agro magnet. Although it doesn't work on monsters, it still works on criminals. You could help a police force (or the RPG equivalent of a police force) to arrest (not kill) criminals. Especially criminals holding hostages, one look at them would prompt them to forget the hostage in a mindless  attempt to attack you as much as possible. The fact that you can only challenge one person at a time is a problem, but better than nothing. 

    Which brings to mind another question: what happens if A hides from B? Or B is blindfolded by A or some stranger C? Does the challenge immediately end? If so, you can now rapidly challenge a bunch of criminals sequentially. If not, does B magically know your location even when you are hidden?

    If not, challenging someone and then hiding would be a good way to use stats without having to kill them. If so, you can use your ability as a reverse tracker, letting your friends track you. Like if you are exploring a dungeon, challenge some B who is being restricted (maybe tied up), and then you can go in alone while your friends waiting with B (or are on the way to B). If B regains his mind, you are further away than 1km. Otherwise, B should be constantly trying to go towards the direction you are in. 

    Also, depending on whether the "challenge" ability is known by others, this can also be used to frame people. Challenge someone and now they act like a homicidal murderer, plenty of grounds to get them arrested. If you are somewhat good at heart, you could challenge people you know are bad. In other words, you could frame bad people for crimes they did not commit since they didn't get punished for the crimes they did commit.

    This ability is also useful for moving people around. For example, if B is stubbornly refusing to believe that the nearby volcano is about to erupt or that a deadly army of goblins is on the way, you can just challenge B and run, forcing B to follow you to safety. 

    Or if B is the shady necromancer who has been harassing the city while hidden in the dark alleys, you can just go in, challenge B, and run back out, effectively dragging B up to the surface where the proper authorities can deal with him.

    Depending on the specific magic system of your RPG setting, this challenge ability may also be used as a kind of magic disruptor/canceler. In many works of fiction, magic requires intense concentration, or peace of mind. Things that are much harder to pull off when influenced by homicidal rage. 

    And then there are ways to abuse the stats themselves apart from using them to kill monsters. You may not want to kill B, but if B is sufficiently evil, subduing B may still be a goal. In which case, copying B's stats could be a great way to determine B's weaknesses, depending on the stats system of the RPG setting. In many RPGs, things like def, resistance, vit, or even specific elemental affinities are all stats. If you copy B's stats, you can then use yourself to determine what you are weak to, effectively revealing what B is weak to. Then your allies can now exploit these weaknesses to subdue B.

    Finally, there is int. Or wis. Or any other assortment of "brain" stats. Suppose B is some kind of evil mastermind, the chess master or the manipulative bastard. Or a demon lord if demon lords aren't considered monsters. By gaining B's stats, you could use your newfound brainpower to unravel his dastardly plans and put a stop to them.

    Need way more detail here, too many undefined points.

    Define "win" and "lose" for the challenge. Do you have to kill them? Knock them out? Can you challenge people who are already on the verge of death?

    Also, what happens if you leave eyesight range? Is that like a ring-out? Can you throw the enemy behind a rock and out of sight, and thus win the challenge?

    >It's possible to resist the homicidal affect but the challenge will be automatically lost.

    Who loses? The challenger? The one who resists? If it's the one who resists, you could pay people to purposely lose. Or promise payment after getting your new stats. Even if losing = death, there could be people who care more about their family and would gladly die to give them money, assuming you have money. 

    Also, even if stats are equalized, I'm assuming the situation isn't. You could position yourself in a superior position (like high ground) before issuing challenges.

    Solution: Use the power of friendship and trickery.

    Protagonist teams up with a mid-level wizard, and a high-stat generalist.  The Wizard uses some debuffs to make the high-stat generalist especially gullible for a couple minutes.

    Protagonist puts on a hat of disguise and adopts the identity of "Dread Pirate Roberts".   Using this disguise, he challenges his high-stat friend.

    Protagonist uses a dimension door to escape and takes the hat off.

    The party now has 2 high-stat generalists.  And the boosted stats will last until the high-stat guy successfully defeats a non-existent pirate.
