## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  I've been reading [Katalepsis](https://katalepsis.net/), which is kind of Gothic horror mixed with Lovecraftian horror. Or, as the author describes it, "urban fantasy story / lesbian supernatural soap opera, with a little bit of a horror coating." 

  The premise is a young woman's sister goes missing while they're kids. Afterwards, no one can remember her, so people think she's crazy. Also she can suddenly see demons/Eldritch horrors all around her, which doesn't help. The story starts when (as you might guess) she figures out she's not crazy, hooks up with some quasi-demon hunters, and tries to get her sister back.

  I enjoyed the development of both story and characters. They're both well fleshed out and draw you in. The characters are well described, with their own personalities, strengths, faults, goals, and fears.

  The story largely takes place on Earth, in a small university town called Sharrowford. It's well described and built up as a small sleepy town where nothing much happens, until you get to the cults and whatnot. It's actually not described that much, rather the places the MC visits are. You get a feel for the relevant parts, but most of Sharrowford exists on the periphery of the story. Aside form the MC, her friends, enemies and allies, I don't think we ever meet another named character.

  The writing is quite well done. It's got a good flow and not too flowery or overly verbose (unless it's describing a demon or cosmic horror). I don't remember any obvious problems, or even minor grammatical errors.

  Anyone have rational horror stories that they want to share? I saw a poster recommend Katalepsis (which I will definitely look into), but any other horror stories? Completed ones would be nice but anything good will do too.

    [Cordyceps](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4c24f8/hsfc_cordyceps_too_clever_for_their_own_good/) is not super scary but I remember liking it, and I guess it counts as horror. 

    Actually I think I wrote an analysis of it that I never published... I could give it a quick edit and post it here on r/rational if anyone's interested.

    I've asked this same question before and here are what people have said: 

    The Final Girls (2015 horror comedy film)  The main character's mother has just died and in an effort to remember her, she goes to watch a classic horror slasher film that is a thin parody of Friday the 13th where her mother was the final girl. After a strange  accident, she and her friends find themselves stuck in the movie. A  funny deconstruction and logical chain of events follows as they try to survive the movie. 

    Eden Green by Fiona van Dahl - a rational horror novel where a character finds her  friend has been infected by a strange parasite that that has made him immortal. Eden, the main character, is a self-styled  rationalist, and her thought processes are shown  in pain-staking detail. Whereas her friends treat everything as a big adventure or a true chance for ending death, Eden does her best (as an amateur) to apply scientific rationale to the symbiote and the strange monsters that are starting to show up. There is some body horror but most of the truly scary stuff  is how it goes into exhaustive detail on how people's thought processes  and consciousness change.

    The  promised neverland - a manga and later anime that is very rational and logical with intricate strategies and mental battles. The first season/story arc anyway as the rest of the story never comes close to the first arc in my opinion. The story takes place in an orphanage of love where the children are raised and tested constantly to improve their intelligence. All goes  well until a small group discover a horrifying truth about their world that I won't spoil as they tell it to you at the end of the first  episode and chapter. But now with the horrible truth revealed, the children must figure out a way to escape the orphanage.

    Hell NO: The Sensible Horror Film - a short on youtube that opens with a group of teenagers arriving to spend the weekend at a creepy cabin in the woods. They promptly leave and drive to get wasted at the beach instead. The rest of the shorts of the film follow a similar theme. Short but funny. 

    The Thing (original not the remake)- the characters ARE intelligent and rational but it just doesn't matter much. The paranoia and lack of trust are what ultimately dooms them. 

    10 Cloverfield Lane - The main character is incredibly resourceful and intelligent in a very nasty situation. 

    You're Next - The Anti Slasher movie in that the last girl is arguably more dangerous than the slashers. She has trained for survival, hand to hand combat, and traps by her survivalist father. Something that she is initially mocked for and it also shows how normal people WOULD panic and make stupid decisions. In this movie, a slasher wearing a mask has trouble breathing through it and it throws off his peripheral vision. 

    Wait until Dark - It started as a play and there have been a few remakes, but I only saw the 60's movie with audrey hepburn. A drug dealer hid some heroin in a doll which came into possession of a blind woman. They kill her roommate and decide to trick the main character, who hasn't been blind for very long, into getting into the house and finding the doll. The main character is intelligent and finds some believable ways to suspect the conmen aren't real and figures out a way to turn the tables. 

    High Tension 2003 film- The main character is crafty and very smart to stay ahead of the killer. Up until the ending. Just ignore the last few minutes and twist ending. 

    Green Room - they make rational decisions but things are so against them that it really doesn't matter much. 

    Splinter - The character make smart choices and its really the only reason they survive. 

    Tremors - Not sure if it counts as horror to modern audiences but they carefully figure out how the monsters work and think of counter measures. Then the monsters get smarter and they need to one up them. 

    Train to Busan - Maybe. They are panicked and still have no idea how things work but they make believable decisions. Might be a culture thing, but in America the main "villain" probably would have been killed or thrown out for the potential trouble he would be in the future.

    If you're fine with visual novels, I'd recommend checking out [Raging Loop](https://store.steampowered.com/app/648100/Raging_Loop/). I posted it in the weekly thread a couple months back after having a really good time with it. The protagonist starts out a bit wacky in an Ignatius Reilly type way, but when push comes to shove, he becomes very analytical. It makes for an interesting dynamic.

    I will say that while it bills itself as a horror story, I personally didn't find it all that scary, but I tend to not find horror media scary in general so YMMV. It's also a bit expensive for a game with no gameplay, but I'm pretty sure the first quarter is up for free on YouTube.

    For movies, Oculus is really good.  The movie starts with a character explaining the full set of powers of the antagonist, and exactly what precautions have been set up to counter each one.  The only reason that the protagonists don't win in the first 15 minutes is because they have an additional goal of proving to the world that the antagonist exists.

  What are some rational works that are focused around religion?

  Not necessarily centered around the magical or mythological aspects, but on the practical, social, and political dimensions of religious organizations. Whether founding a religion, maintaining the cohesion of a church, spreading a faith, reformation, protecting a religion from persecutors, fighting against specific religions, etc.

    This isn't exactly what you're looking for, but [*Unsong*](http://unsongbook.com/prologue-2/) by Scott Alexander (of Slate Star Codex) is one of my all-time favorite stories. The premise is that Kabbalistic Judaism and some form of Gnostic Christianity are true. Humanity discovers this in the late 1960s. The story is set in the present day, and explores how society has changed because of the discovery.

      *Unsong* is fantastic. I printed and bound a copy of book 1 and gifted it to a relative who majored in theology. They absolutely loved it.

          Well, it's a bit of work and you'll need a sewing machine, a (duplex) laser printer, and a shop capable of slicing thick stacks of paper, but here's the process I used:

           1. Download/rip/copypaste text into a Word document and do formatting. Add things like dynamic TOC, page numbers, cover page, etc. Also, add blank pages to ensure new chapters start on odd (or even) pages so it looks good. Make sure font size is good.

           2. Print as booklets. This part is a bit tricky and you'll either need a duplex-capable printer or the discipline to do it on a one-sided printer. I printed four-sheet booklets meaning that each booklet contained 16 pages

           3. Assemble booklets. Fold each batch of four sheets in half and nest them so the page numbers are in the proper order. Then, using a sewing machine and thread color of choice, sew down the middle of the fold in each booklet. Make sure to do some tests first so you can dial in the thread tension. 

           4. Bind the booklets together. Stack and align all the folded and sewed booklets, then clamp them flat under pressure in a vice or between sheets of wood. Find a ribbon or other piece of cloth to glue onto the binding. I used hot glue--you want a glue that stays flexible when dry.

           5. Get the pages trimmed to size. Now that you have a book, all the pages will be slightly different sizes. I took mine to a Copyshop and had them use their thick stack paper slicer to cut the non-bound edges to perfectly flat.

           6. Add a cover. This is a bit tricky because you need to make sure that the book can still open. If you're going for hardcover, it's easiest if the spine is flexible, maybe cloth. 

           7. Enjoy your book!

            I've got a laser cutter capable of doing some nice stuff with leather. I've often though about doing small runs of leather bound books based of stuff in this subreddit. It would have to be pretty expensive though, easily $100 a book after the printing and binding. Maybe just sell covers?

            If anyone is interested in getting some book covers laser cut out of leather I'd give them a deal, and help out a bit with basic design work.

    [Prince of Nothing Trilogy](https://www.goodreads.com/series/40519-the-prince-of-nothing) is centered around a holy war, and deals closely with religion and faith from the protagonist's very cynical perspective. 

     The sequel series [**major spoilers**] >!is set decades after the protagonist from the first trilogy has been declared a prophet of the religion he was exploiting. He has unlimited control of the entire world and turns the entirety of human civilization to another holy war, this time against extra-dimensional aliens who want to destroy the entire universe because they found out that hell is actually real.!< It's some wild shit. 

    They're both intensely rational works, written by a rather pedantic philosophy PhD. I loved the shit out of both of them.

    Basically all of Brandon Sanderson's works deal with religion in some form. Not always with the organizational side of it, his characters are usually more the people on the outside of the system looking in, but it's obvious he's put thought into how a religion like the one he's describing would evolve and fit into general society.

    [*Oceanic*, by Greg Egan](http://www.gregegan.net/OCEANIC/Complete/Oceanic.html) is... hard to describe (like most of his work), but it's the first thing I thought of and highly recommended.

    For non-fiction, [*Practical Polytheism](https://acoup.blog/category/collections/practical-polytheism/) is an engaging and very readable short blog series about religion in the ancient world - not much like the stereotypes!

    And while only dubiously rational (it's a nice fantasy setting...), David Eddings' *Elenium* trilogy features Church knights as protagonists, with considerable religious intrigue. I remember that abuse of the proceedure for determining the voting threshold for motions in church meetings was a plot point... More fun than that makes it sound.

  So I stumbled onto [Borne of caution](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/36950/borne-of-caution) on RR and realized I need some decent Pokémon self-inserts. From my search so far I have only found [https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13202202/1/Dreaming-of-Family](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13202202/1/Dreaming-of-Family) (Which is awesome!) but wondering if there is any you guys enjoyed and recommend? The one request/requirement, is I don't like the cannon anime plot much and already read origin of species (so am tired of red/Garry etc) so don't want any which just re-hash cannon, but change it significantly ideally from a characters perspective outside the direct plot. 

  Thanks!

    It isn't a self-insert story, but I remember [Pedestal](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4871317/1/Pedestal) being pretty good. My last read through was something like eight years ago, so I may be misremembering, but I think it had a similar-ish feel to Borne of Caution. And it for sure didn't borrow much from the canon story.
    ```

    - u/GaBeRockKing:
      ```
      Pedestal is the epitome of what a Nuzlocke fanfiction should aspire to be. (Note that I am not actually sure as to whether Pedestal is based off a Nuzlocke)
      ```

  - u/Sonderjye:
    ```
    What about dreaming of family makes it awesome to you?  The premise is interesting but the first chapter doesn't convince me that it'll deliver.
    ```

    - u/Dragfie:
      ```
      It has an OP MC who doesn't take unrealistic actions, does a multitude of cool things including making an organization to benefit the whole world with enough realism that it doesn't make me cringe and the way pokemon are described and connected to their trainers are really nice. <- This is like 90% of my subjective favorites in a story so it would be Awesome to me. 

      The negatives would be its not too rational, I feel everyone agrees too easily with the MC a little but this may be completely realistic if you take into account that Aura users can't lie. (Would authoritarianism work if all the top leadership can't lie and have been proven to have good intentions? Not sure, and the way most people just goes with it feels a little weird to me.) 
      The world is just explained enough that it doesn't brake emersion (such as Jenny's and Joy's are explained as a "clan", like psychics or aura users) but I feel getting rid of them would be more realistic. 
      Its very "sappy" with lots of brooding but mostly loads of "I love you"'s. Some of the pokemon's affection I feel is a little forced but not enough to turn me off. 
      The battles would be cool but I don't care about action so I just skip those usually. I just like the "crushes everyone and interacts with crowd after" and "does X heroic things and see people's reactions" scenes which there are plenty off.

      Edit: Also, it looks dead but it ends on a decent place with the first meeting with ash, so I don't feel unsatisfied actually which is very rare for me and unfinished stories.
      ```

      - u/Sonderjye:
        ```
        Thnks! Does MC actully manage to create that org and does it have real impact, or does he just talk/elude to it?
        ```

        - u/Dragfie:
          ```
          Its "done" by the last chapter, so yes, as I mentioned it actually is a decent spot to end. It feels like the end of the "first book", where the second would be starting from the start of cannon.

          Edit: "done" as in even if the MC died it would go on to be a major power for a long time.
          ```

          - u/Sonderjye:
            ```
            So not 'done' in the sense that it already have caused major societal changes?
            ```

            - u/Dragfie:
              ```
              As in, it has achieved its initial goal: make an organization which is a force for good to assist the "chosen one" (ash) in his adventures as a support role. This has been achieved by the last chapter, the organization is made and is a force for good and powerful enough to matter.

  I've been reading an ongoing web serial, [Just A Bystander](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/32123/just-a-bystander), the past couple days, and it was about 93% composed of everything I love in fantasy.  It plays with inverting and subverting the chosen hero prophecy tropes in a way I've never seen done before. 

  It's a fantasy in a techmagic world whose magic system that's simultaneously very hard/math-y and also very soft, so I don't even know how to describe it.  I just know I loved it, and it gave me a similar feeling as a lot of what I love about rational fiction so I figured it might fit over here.

    Soft dissent - I read like the first 30+ chapters of this and got overwhelmed by Gary Stu vibes. Which kinda make sense in the setting for reasons I don't want to spoiler, but it bothered me I guess because from the intro themes I expected the MC to struggle more.

    There were some very nice bits though so I might come back to this someday and see if there's an alternate reading.
    ```

    - u/DangerouslyUnstable:
      ```
      Yeah, except I would upgrade that to a hard de-rec. It has some of the flavor of things this sub likes, but it fails utterly on substance. I just gave up on it at somewhat farther along than you did. The main character (and all the characters, really) get major power ups for essentially no effort, they seem to be entirely reacting to the plot with no proactiveness at all, and I just don't really understand why I, or the characters, should care about anything in the plot at all. 

      Major spoilers: >!We aren't given a very good reason for any of the characters to have a problem with the Fateweavers, or the prophecy more broadly, since it's hinted that the culture more generally views the fateweavers and prophecy to be tools of their society's success and power. The fact that it seems to end badly for them individually doesn't seem like enough for _all_ of them to, without much thought, decide to act against the prophecy It would be like having a squad of soldiers told that a mission integral to the success of a war is likely to result in their death. That one or two of them would object, sure...but all of them? None of these people thinks it's worth dying to continue the success of their country? And furthermore, when and how the prophecy is able to force/prevent action is completely unexplained and reeks of the worst sort of "because the plot needed it to work that way in this situation". The story as a whole has a veneer of "hard fantasy" but it's just that: a veneer. Underneath the surface it is just as handwave-y and soft as any other fantasy series since the "rules" are unexplained and so complicated that it's not possible for a reader to get any idea of what is or is not possible.!<

        we have people who can't even handle a minor inconvenience to aid their country, so I don't find this difficult to believe at all

        plus, these are students, not soldiers - they didn't sign up to put their lives on the line

      I'm in a similar spot, but further along. Having trouble keeping interest because... I'm actually not sure why. Maybe the character is bland, maybe because the character doesn't do much. I haven't read the past 10 updates.

  I'm looking for some game recommendations for a young child (around 4 years old) who's new to video games but really not good at them. The only game that they've had any success playing so far is "Donut County" and even then only the earlier levels. As a frame of reference, they found 'The Untitled Goose Game' too difficult to play, and that's one of the most commonly suggested games for young kids

  In terms of requirements:

  1. The game has to be forgiving of inaccurate and slow input accuracy. They struggle when they need to make accurate inputs quickly
  2. Preferably, the game would not be story based, as they can't read yet. 
  3. Ideally, the game would be fun too. Donut County is good because eating things with holes is fun regardless of how easy it is

  The only other game that I've found that meets this criteria is Katamari Damacy, but I haven't tried it out yet.

  I've tried searching for lists of these types of games, but I haven't found much success. Those types of lists tend to be geared towards kids of older ages. I've seen some people say that kids that young shouldn't be playing video games, and should basically be doing anything else. That's fair, but not really helpful in this case. This video game session happens when the kids can't go out, and this kids siblings love playing Terraria, a game that they can't join in because it's too hard for them. Having a video game that they can play goes a long way towards making them feel included, and that's not something that they get often. 

  Coop games that have the second player play a much easier role than the first player are okay too
  ```

    I suggest Minecraft. While I have no firsthand experience with little children playing it, I have seen other parents mentioning that their 4/5 year old plays it.

    Minecraft doesn't need a good accuracy for normal gameplay, it is not story-based and it is a lot of fun - see huge long term success over all age groups.

    I would recommend to start out with creative mode, so the child can play around a bit and learn the control mechanics. Then maybe switch to survival on peaceful difficulty. Look for a mod which locks peaceful difficulty, I'm sure there exists one. I would also recommend one which lets you keep your inventory if your player character dies (from falling, drowning, lava in peaceful mode).

    Minecraft is great to learn exploring, trying out things you imagine and being creative. I also see no problems with violence as long as it is in peaceful mode - the above mentioned modes of dying aren't depicted in a horrifying fashion for a 4 year old, but that is just a guess. Check out Youtube videos if in doubt.

    Minecraft can also be played in (local) multiplayer. And there is an education version somewhere out there, I think, although I haven't checked and don't now what it entails. I recommend the Java version as it is the most versatile one (mods, ...).

    I have personally only played computer games from 7 years on. But for the latter age group I would recommend games like Anno, The Settlers, zoo simulations.

    I have a four year old who is able to navigate peaceful Minecraft more or less on his own.

    The first PC game that I had him learn was Fatty Bear's Birthday Surprise, which is one of Humongous Entertainment's suite of point-and-click adventure titles from the mid-90's. Some enterprising soul has acquired the rights to them and gotten an emulator to work with modern Windows and sells them on steam for like $5 a pop. There's at least two dozen titles to choose from; I just happen to know Fatty Bear like the back of my hand so I chose that one as the introduction (I acquired the entire set on sale for like $25 several years ago in anticipation of this very application).

    As a point-and-click, there's no action or twitch reflexes required, and being that it targets kids, each room is full of wacky and zany things to click on, giving him an incentive to explore while slowly learning how to use a mouse. There's no text, and the game presents the player with goals through full voice acting.

    It took a few months of semiregular play for him to get it. I put him on my lap and guided the mouse while he clicked, eventually graduating to having him control the mouse and sitting in the chair on his own. I started around when he was 2, so it's possible yours might pick it up faster.

    From there we tried minecraft, again with him on my lap controlling the mouse while I worked the left hand keyboard controls. Eventually he had the hang of it enough to be able to move forward (I tell him the W is for Walk), open the inventory, and throw things on the ground. I have it set to peaceful as he takes his time getting around and would likely get stomped by AI at this point.

    Before we ever went on the PC, however, we got him a cheap android tablet and loaded it up with a number of apps. Most of them try to be somewhat educational (I have letter and number apps, a handwriting app, math bingo, and a proto-programming game that he has just in the last year managed to grok), but there's also some games just for fun as well, including puzzle apps, random activity apps, a piano app, and things like a Lego building app.

    He devours these at any rate I'll feed them to him, and I place full credit for his ability to read and write at the feet of some of these apps. If you want I can get a full list of what we use. 

    Besides those, I also have a couple of games on my phone that I permit him to play with limited time, such as Angry Birds and Hero Rescue, tho these are more because of ads and such that I don't trust him unsupervised time with lest I end up with a gutted wallet.

    All told I think I'm satisfied with his progress; in a number of ways he's ahead of the curve. His 2 year old sister has made similar progress, tho we shan't see if it paid off so well until she grasps it all. She can read off the alphabet if nothing else, so the potential is there.

    I mostly played the original Legend Of Zelda at that age. Took me a whole year. Even though it's a lot harder than later Zelda games, it meets your criteria better, as things don't move very quickly, the plot is irrelevant, and you can generally progress by going somewhere at random and hitting your head against it. I think crucially there was no real expectation that I should be any better at it than I was; having other kids able to step in and help might make it feel more daunting.

    I'd also consider Mario games (though I found them frustrating until I was five). The older ones are fine with an infinite lives cheat. The newer 2D ones are probably okay, but I don't know first hand. Mario Galaxy has your requested much easier player two role, which I've seen kids get a kick out of.

    More recent games, which I don't have experience playing as or with a kid:

    * Celeste has an extensive accessibility/assistance mode that might actually work well for kids, the same way my Game Genie did when I was a kid.

    * Maybe Goat Simulator? The controls are complicated, but you can just do whatever and that is, indeed, the point. It's not very wholesome though.

    * Zen Bound 2 is a puzzle game about 3D reasoning that uses no words or numbers.

    * Incredipede (on normal) is a puzzle game about figuring out how to move as a poorly designed physics creature. It has very easy controls. If it gets harder, I got bored before it did. But it's cute, I'd look into it as a kids game.
    ```

    - u/AcceptableBook:
      ```
      Celeste might be a good suggestion here. I already have the game, and can try it when I next see them. I'm also going to try some of the other games you mentioned, but probably buy them one at a time.

    Minecraft might work. All the items have names, but you generally don't need to be able to read them to figure out how they work. 

    You might need to show them how to work the recipe book, tell them what tools work on what blocks, and you'll probably want to set the difficulty to "peaceful" to prevent any monsters from spawning.

    It's basically Legos on steroids. One of the most popular kids games out there.

    > Terraria

    There is Journey mode, which should make the game significantly easier. If Terraria's Journey mode is too hard, you can install a mod that allows God Mode (prevents the character from dying)—"HERO's Mod - Terraria Creative Mode", "Cheat Sheet", etc. That should be enough to make the game easy for anyone.

            Note Abzu has jump scare scenes later which may be a bit much for a four-year-old, as does Journey (albeit to a lesser extent). Flower is much much better in that respect, as well as having forgiving controls and no way to lose.

    Multi-days-late reply: I have a now 6-year-old; Katamari Damacy itself isn't a great choice because of the time limits in levels, which can be frustrating to a 4-year-old, though I had a lot of success with Katamari Forever (PS3), which (if you've beaten a level yourself well enough) has "eternal" mode in levels with no time limit and he loved it.

    On mobile/tablet, I'd highly highly recommend the (free) PBS Kids app, which has about a hundred small games that swap out over time, all themed after PBS shows and appropriate for 4-6 year olds in both content and pacing.

    I had the most success at that age with mobile games, honestly, though the problem is that most "kids" games a) need reading, b) are a little too hard, or c) the big one, shove ads in your face. The games that worked for us from ages 4-5 were:

    * Toca Nature (small terraforming/play with animals game)
    * Loopimal (loop-based music creator)
    * Crazy Gears (puzzles)
    * Frost (puzzle game)

    As he got closer to 6, he loved Love You To Bits, Bring You Home (puzzle adventure games), Shine (adventure), and Sky (adventure, though I don't think when he started that he knew what the heck was going on).

    But mostly PBS Kids.

  dose anyone have a list of good fanfictions or a good fanfiction site?

  I have been reading some fanfictions but have found it's hard to find the good ones partially because sites like sufficient velocity don't have a rating system.
  ```

  - u/PeridexisErrant:
    ```
    If you have a fandom in mind, tv tropes has reclists of varying usefulness - "has a solid tropes page" usually indicates a longish and well executed fic though.

    Sorting complete fics by kudos on Archive of our Own (IMO the best fanfiction site) is also very useful - I usually really like about a quarter to a third of the high-ranked stuff and that's due to taste rather than quality. Filtering by date can mitigate the first-mover advantage and help uncover more recent gems.
    ```

  - u/Dragongeek:
    ```
    You can sort on Spacebattles and Sufficient velocity according to "First message reaction score" or simply by views to roughly get popular fics. If it's Worm fanfiction, there's also Worm story search.
    ```

  Accidentally posted this in the week-old thread:

  One of the things I’ve really enjoyed about **Delve** is the protagonist’s recent decision to focus on building up his group and community and not just developing his own power.

  Am looking for more recommendations (rational or not) that get beyond the traditional individualistic power fantasy and focus on mutual aid and community building.

  There’s something primally appealing about protagonists powering up, but am finding it doesn’t really fit in with my politics of how a society ought to be, so am curious to see what else is out there.
  ```

  - u/DangerouslyUnstable:
    ```
    Delve has it's issues (which are frequently discussed in the delve posts, although I think it is much more enjoyable read in large chunks, rather than reading it every week), but it also has some bright spots, as you point out. 

    But the main thing I have taken away from it in recent weeks is I really miss the feeling I got back in the day playing WoW and other MMORPGs when I got into a good dungeon group where everyone was doing a great job at their role. I have zero interest in dedicating the time it takes to play those games anymore, but man did I enjoy playing healer in a competent group back then.

      I've been reading this for a while now, and it's thoroughly mediocre, but I guess I've kept on reading it at least. It does have a lot of various quirks to the worldbuilding and the powers and stuff, but doesn't go into much depth. There's a wide range of characters, but it reaches the point where there's way too many to actually give any one character any real development past their introduction/main arc. Even if the translation is reasonable quality, it still holds a few of the generic terrible tropes of Japanese web novels, even if moderated (gender binary/roles are obvious in the world, but are somewhat broken with strong companions. Protag is treated like a harem protagonist by his followers, but he got reincarnated from scratch and physically doesn't "take advantage" of this. There's a lot of generic litrpg power levels, but unique abilities kinda do a lot of heavy lifting. Etc)

    You could try Tower of Somnus. It's not Delve, the MC hasn't formed a group or anything. But it feels a lot more teamwork oriented than most litRPG I read. The MC hasn't done anything in game solo, and the team do work together in competent ways.
    ```

    - u/danielparks:

      [Tower of Somnus](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/36983/tower-of-somnus). It sounds like it will be finished pretty soon, since it’s being written for National Novel Writing Month.

      The same [author](https://www.royalroad.com/profile/138217/fictions) is writing [Blessed Time](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/33020/blessed-time), which has been recommended here a few times.

      Neither of these strike me as being about upleveling other people the way Rain is in Delve, but you may enjoy them all the same.

      - u/TheColourOfHeartache:
        ```
        Tower of Sounds is good, and at least feels like a plausible RPG where parties and builds matter. blessed time I'm less keen on, the MC was soloing dungeons above his level and the author failed to convince me he was competent enough for anything like that
        ```

        - u/lillarty:
          ```
          Wasn't the dungeon soloing largely powered by summoning ridiculously powerful demons? I haven't read it in a while so I may be misremembering, but I'm pretty sure he only started his solo stuff after he figured out how to summon demons without human sacrifice, which let him use them whenever he wanted. 

          Don't need to be a particularly competent fighter if you have nigh-indestructible monstrosity killing everything for you, you know?
          ```

          - u/TheColourOfHeartache:

    Just realized that my most recent read story fits this:  
    [dreaming of family](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13202202/1/Dreaming-of-Family). Its a self-insert pokemon fan fic but hits exactly what you are describing; not just because the MC makes her pokemon powerful but aims to create a whole organization with is like the antithesis of the "teams" just like rain.
    ```

  - u/CaramilkThief:
    ```
    Ar'Kendrythist is a bit like that, although there's an element of individualistic power fantasy as well. Later on in the story Eric really works on his relations with other countries and figures of power, because even though he's an archmage he can still be killed instantly if caught unprepared. To alleviate this he not only develops his local community (sometimes to its detriment) but also exchanges favors and services with other countries/archmages/gods. It gets to the point that I'd say Eric's connections with powerful people is as impressive as his repertoire of magic.

  Any good Monster Hunter fanfiction ? I've been looking at the lore a bit and it's COOL. (Most of this will be my Headcannon but still)..

  &#x200B;

  Human civilization collapses, a colony in an alien planet gets stranded. To try to reconnect or escape they do some heavy bioengineering on the native fauna, and on humans themselves, eventually a highly intelligent group animals unite and destroy their civilization. They lose their tech and their history.

  &#x200B;

  Thanks to the planets lower gravity and the genetic augmentations some humans who descend from soldiers display incredible feats like improved healing and superhuman strength. Others who descend from scholars and leaders form a different species that's longer lived and more intelligent than average humans.

  &#x200B;

  Together they fight for survival in this alien world full of dragons and giant monsters. The only memory of their past as a space faring civilization is what they call the Sapphire Star, which is actually an abandoned space station orbiting the planet..

  &#x200B;

  Anyone knows any good fanfiction for it ? The setting potential is quite high, with a decent plot it'd be incredible.

  I'm trying to remember the title of a story, which might have been a serial and might not. Character embarks on the great Hero's Journey quest to defeat the demon lord or whatever, but they are in fact *not* the great Hero, and are just a regular person tired of waiting for the great Hero to show up.

    > opinions on the story in question, if you know what it is, would be welcome

    *How to Defeat a Demon King in Ten Easy Steps* pokes gentle fun at and subverts high fantasy cliches, similar to the way [Bored of the Rings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bored_of_the_Rings) and [Dark Lord of Derkholm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Lord_of_Derkholm) did it earlier.

    For what it's worth, this contribution to the sub-genre didn't work for me, but then neither did its author's popular progression fantasy *Sufficiently Advanced Magic*, so I may not be the best person to ask. I think it's primarily the characterization that I have a problem with  -- his characters always feel off in various ways.

  - u/Dragongeek:

    This sounds like *How to Defeat a Demon King in Ten Easy Steps* by Andrew Rowe. I listened to it as an audiobook, and it was enjoyable. It's mostly a riff/parody of Zelda and the "rational" comes through quite well without detracting from the story

    https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/the-sins-of-cinnamon.7774/reader   Unfinished quest, by author "Question Dragon". On permanent hiatus until the worldbuilding same universe quest "days of Thyme" , which is also on permanent hiatus. 

    The author also has started a warhammer 40k/dungeon keeper series, pretty short but active.  https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/blood-thirsty-dungeon-keeper-in-space.12569/page-2#post-3629685

    Of these three, only "days of Thyme" has no smut. Prose is very good.

    If you're willing to try games, [The Last Sovereign](https://the-last-sovereign.blogspot.com/) is pretty good.

    I made [a longer post](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/ismlth/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/g5q7i6b/) a couple months ago that covers it in some detail, but in short it's a smutty rpg about a jaded veteran who gains a sex based power from the same source as the evil overlord who is plaguing his Homeland.

    There's a pretty strong emphasis on sensible decision-making and a use of "soft power" like economics and diplomacy that I've not seen in *any* rpg, adult or otherwise. The setting is explicitly non rational, but the response to it from the main characters is exactly what anyone from this subreddit might hope for.

It was a bit short, but it's part of the Mage Errant series, which has several books that total over 1300 pages.

        It's a mixed bag. Some are more rational than others, but they all have rational elements in one way or another, whether it be characters, their goals, actions and solutions, or wordbuilding.

        A lot of these are relatively new, the only one with more than 300,000 words would be *Unbound*, though some others are getting there, and some have a finished book.
