  I like how Rumlow is played as the sane man in this fic, at least in comparison to Toni. 
  I am half liking and half hating the Pym particles handwave, it's good because it simplifies the physics bending and can provide interesting interactions between people's powers, but its also bad because it really should not be used for all advanced technology and biological advancements. 

  The part about Scarlet's powers differentiating complex systmes by abstract concepts was awesome, that's nice. The codename addage also good.

  Humor is pretty good, the part about polyamory and Toni's reactions to it were funny and consistent with her previous characterization.

  Super glad the author hasn't abandoned this fic.
