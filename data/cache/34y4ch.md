## [Q] Is there a rational choice for US president in the upcoming elections?

### Post:

I'm trying to get better about following politics and this will be the first time I've voted with the benefit of caring about rationality. Who, if anyone, should I keep my eye on?

  Being as apolitical as possible ...

  If you care about your vote, start looking into local politics - the more local, the better. You're one of ~~300 million~~ ~240 million eligible people / ~130 million actual people voting for President, and we use both Electoral College and plurality rule, which means that unless you're in a swing state, your time and effort are best spent elsewhere. If you're trying to maximize your values, look to your state and local legislatures.

  The other really important thing is that voting is one of the least meaningful acts when it comes to politics. If you really want to engage in the process, write letters to your politicians (state and local), volunteer for campaigns, or volunteer for non-profits that are trying their best to influence politics. Talk to your friends and family about who they should vote for, go door-to-door for a campaign, call people up, etc. Just going to the polls on election day is a good way to maximize the appearance of civic engagement for minimal effort, but it's not the best way to maximize political change in whatever direction you prefer with the same minimal effort. Same with donation - unless you're stinking rich, donate time instead of money, because your time is probably more valuable to a campaign than the equivalent amount of money you would be willing to give.

  **So the problem of vote maximization is what we're left with** - and again, I'm going be as apolitical as possible, because I think you can rationally hold a whole host of political beliefs depending on your terminal values. What you're left with is a game theory question.

  1. We live in a society that has first-past-the-post voting, which is a terrible system. In that system, you want to find the largest collective of voters that roughly align with your beliefs and vote with them so that the other largest collective of voters doesn't get their guy.
  2. One caveat to this is that some election funding depends on the percentage of votes gained, so it's sometimes in your best interests to vote with a different collective in the hopes of electing someone better in the future and/or influence how future voting collectives form. If you can find a voting collective large enough to do that (you'd have to look up state and federal guidelines and get some data) it's probably worth your while. (*edit: At a federal level, 5% is the minimum to gain access to FEC General Election Fund money.*)
  3. Another caveat is that our voting system sucks in a number of ways. It might be in your best interests to align with a voting collective that's for election reform, even if you disagree with their other policies. The most important aspects of voting reform are getting rid of first-past-the-post in favor of something better, reducing the impact of money on politics, reducing corruption, and reducing gerrymandering. (Good luck.)
  4. Get in on the ground floor as much as possible. Attend a primary or caucus. By the time it comes down to either the Republican or Democrat, most of the election game is already over.

  Or vote your conscience to make a stand, if you want. The system might actually work if everyone did that, but there's a strong incentive to defect from that collaborative strategy. (*edit: Though then you're left with the fact that first-past-the-post fails on the "independence of clones" criterion, among others, which would cause the voting system to run into failure states even if no one was engaging in strategic voting or strategic nomination.*)

    This is surprising to me -- if the average person can do more good for a campaign by giving time than money, that means the campaign would be in a better position if it used its money to buy peoples' time. Is it a regulatory issue that stops this from being the case, or something more akin to the [overjustification effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overjustification_effect)?

    One other possible interpretation I see is that people will consider that 3 hours of their time volunteering is equivalent to a $10 donation, but will only work for a single hour in exchange for $10. This would surprise me a little bit, but I don't know if that's just because money and time are extremely fungible in both directions to me.

      A lot of what you do when you volunteer for a campaign is go door-to-door or get on the phones, if you're at the lower levels. If you just walk in the doors of your local political office, you already *probably* have a bunch of things that a prospective employee wouldn't - an honest desire to see the candidate elected, an understanding of the candidate's policies and platform, and enthusiasm for the campaign. If you're talking on the phone to someone and they ask "Are you going to vote for him?" it's important that the answer be "Yes" (and I'm sure that you can understand why asking employees to lie would be a political disaster in this case).

      So it's not really a simple case of "time is money". There are also some confounding variables - there are startup costs associated with a new volunteer, so if you value your time at $20 and only want to give $5 to the campaign, cash would be preferred to those 15 minutes. But in general, yes, you need to have a pretty sizable income before your money is worth more than the equivalent time. Campaigns also don't have to pay taxes, healthcare, etc. on volunteers, so there's less overhead in many respects.

      And that's all without getting into the potential ability to use personal skills that would bill at a much higher rate. I'm a software engineer who works on contract (through a company), and my time bills at some ridiculous amount. That amount factors in managers, rent on my office, utilities like a fat internet pipe, healthcare, retirement fund, taxes, etc. I haven't inquired into the numbers lately, but for every dollar spent on my time by the company I'm contracted out to, only a fraction of it comes to me after my company and the government take their cut. So if I volunteer for a campaign building them a website, I'm cutting out a huge swath of middlemen and accomplishing a whole lot more than if I had just gone to my job, worked the same number of hours, and handed over the money after getting my paycheck.

      (I was trying to find a source for what the tipping point is in terms of the value political campaigns place on a volunteer-hour and failed, because people talk about money in politics too much and it was crowding out my search results with mostly irrelevant links.)

  Nobody here is sufficiently rational that they'll be able to overcome their biases in politics.

  If you live in a contested state, vote for the better candidate even if they're sub optimal.  If that candidate is going to win your state by a landslide, vote third party to raise the percentage they get and weaken the "third party is throwing your vote away" narrative.

  Real-world politics is a long game, and the President/Prime Minister is usually the equivalent of either the King or, if you have a strong head of government in your system, at best the Queen in chess.

  Of course, in politics, you need your man/woman to hold lower office before higher office, in most cases, so it's as if you needed to move your preferred piece from pawn to bishop to knight to queen/king throughout the game.  At any given time, the opportunity to make a very good piece into the queen/king *appears* to have a high marginal impact, but *in fact* you needed to strategize by raising and keeping whole cohorts of strong pieces *the entire game*.

  So while I will be supporting Bernie Sanders with my own money and efforts, I think that the *real* way to win is to vote, donate, write, speak, and volunteer for whole parties or movements at once.  No individual politician can swoop in and messianically save a party/movement whose organizing infrastructure, power base, and local activism have gone to rot.

  I'll now enumerate my priorities for this election year:

  * Minimize Republican office-holding.  I know this is going to sound ever so depressingly "Blue Tribe" of me, but sorry, if your party runs and governs on a platform of religion overriding science on matters of civilization-scale risk and damage (in this case, global warming), then you are *strictly* worse than the party whose weird pseudo-religious leanings override science on matters of personal health or purity (ie: GMOs, NIMBY, vaccines, etc).

  * Other than the specific candidates I favor, I do believe the Democratic Party sucks too, and feel uncertain about the Green Party (though they are a superior alternative where you can vote for them without screwing the Democrats).  Technophobia is fucking irritating to hear about on GMOs, nuclear power, and vaccines.  Technophilia for the "innovation industry" is *massively* fucking irritating *because I work in the tech industry and it's not fucking like that*.

  * The rational thing to do is pick sane, forward-thinking candidates and movements at the primary level and act there.  In particular, gerrymandering has decreased swing elections, but opens incumbents to "primary attacking".  This can and should be used to strengthen movements outside the party establishment.

  * Push hard with candidates like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren to strengthen socialism and social-democracy at the national and local levels, along with the new labor movement at the "bottom-up" level.  I have it from an actual sociologist that things like the "Fight for 15" and improvements to unionization laws are the maximally effective points of attack for a pro-labor voter or activist, as electoral labor movements *can't* function and win without a tidal force of local and workplace-level labor activism beneath them.

  For everyone else here, I simply strongly recommend attacking anti-science candidates and religious candidates, and supporting pro-science, secularist candidates.  If you want to open the debate over socioeconomic systems and ask why I support the partisan wing I do, fine, and I can hear why you support the wing you support.  But generically to "rationality", the important thing is to have secularism and science on the move, and to attack the global warming problem as fast and hard as we can.

    Good point. The relative merits of capitalist versus socialist methods to stop global warming are irrelevant if the ostensibly more capitalist party denies that it even exists.

      Yeah, I mean: if you live in Germany or something and want to vote for the CDU for reasons that seem rational to you, then I disagree, but the disagreement may be one of values or priorities.  Merkel is *competent* if nothing else, and listens to experts.

      But yeah, "reduce total fossil-fuel usage" may be a good supergoal for politics right now, if we want to talk about largest-scale impacts.

  Here's the long form.

  Before the candidates are decided, 55 dead men from over 200 years ago eliminate nearly 7 billion contenders, by requiring that the president have been born in the US 35 years ago. 

  The next narrowing is also historic, in that the only "serious" contenders must be a member of one of the two major parties, and have some degree of favor with the party leadership. 

  Now we're probably down to a few hundred contenders. So we select "those who want the job". Which is a terrible thing to select for. 

  "It is a well-known fact that those people who must want to rule people are, ipso facto, those least suited to do it... anyone who is capable of getting themselves made President should on no account be allowed to do the job." -- Douglas Adams

  So now we have the dozen or so people who want the job and meet the eligibility requirements and are in favor with the party leadership. Next stop, the primary. 

  I believe Iowa is the first state. So in Iowa, the dozen or so are narrowed down to 3 leaders for each party, and the media adopts the narrative that those people are the only real contenders for the position. For the rest of the election, everyone acts as if this is true. By the time even the primary in your state shows up, your choice is fully constrained to a few pre-approved options, none of whom are actually going to have anything in common with you, or your interests.

  After the primary system, the only real contenders are the red guy and the blue guy, and at this point it is a matter of "Are things bad enough that the people reverse direction?" If things are good, the guy of the color currently in office has the advantage. If they are not so good, the other guy has the advantage. There's some variability, based on what kind of noises come out of the mouth of the approved guy because people think the mouth noises mean things, but it's inconsequential in the big picture. 

  Your vote doesn't even matter, except in aggregate.

    Also, keep in mind that, because of how electoral votes are assigned, [votes in some states are worth more than in others](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wC42HgLA4k). So, if you live in a big(ger) state? Sorry bout your luck!

    As a minor nitpick, Iowa is the first electoral event, but it's a caucus, not a primary. The first primary is New Hampshire (a few days later).
    ```

    - u/trifith:
      ```
      It was a case of "close enough" for the point I was making. The distinction between a caucus and a primary is not one most people know. The entire portion of the electoral season in which the caucuses and the state primary elections take place is called primary season in the media anyway.
