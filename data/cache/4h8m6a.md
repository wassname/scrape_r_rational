  It's mildly possible that I am just wired on coffee, but I think this chapter was your best! It was exciting, dramatic, and clear what was going on at all times. Favourite quotes:

  >"That's what makes renegades so scary, isn't it? They don't walk around with a big red R on their shirt. Anyone could be one."

  (Very HPMoR, by the way--a mild jab at canon that also epitomises how your story is different.)


  >"Fire and fungi. Bugs and birds. Poison and paras. Simple equations with obvious outcomes, if the variables are anywhere near even. [...]"


  And finally the quote by Giovanni at the end. World building! Drama! Only one slight critique on that. "[T]here was once a wealthy province where petty crime ran rampant[...]" sounds weak, like a mythology rather than an actual historic event. The passive phrasing gives it that feeling. I'd recommend having Giovanni more specific as to the event/time period to give it historical credence.

    Your interpretation might be correct though, it could just be a parable.

    Thanks, glad you enjoyed it!

    As /u/VivaLaPandaReddit said, it's meant to sound like a parable because it is one, but I might edit it later :)
    ```

    - u/None:

      Or perhaps call it specifically "The Parable of the X" or something. 

      Also wanted to comment on some reviews you got.

      >I cannot imagine any 11 year olds with the kind of minds your characters seem to possess. Precocious 15 year olds, perhaps, but not 11 year olds. Even if their circumstances forced them to mature faster. Pardon me for this, but maybe you're putting in a bit of "I wish this is how I could react to this situation" as opposed to "This is a reasonable 11 year old's response to this situation". Just my opinion, but if you agree with me, I think this story would make more sense by having them set out on their journey at 14 or 15. I just can't imagine parents sending out their kids into near certain death at the age of 11.

      This is silly. Canon states that ten year olds go out into the world on Pokemon journeys. You don't have to explain or justify that anymore than you have to explain or justify the existence of  Pokeballs. (Long-term backpacking in real life also tends to leave one looking, smelling, and often feeling like the victim of some bizarre and horrifically violent sexual crime, but it's canon that this isn't true in the Pokemon universe. So as long as you don't go jumping around pointing at it and making it a plot point or something, it doesn't distract/detract from the story.) My little brother is nine and the idea of him going out alone is laughable (he probably wouldn't even be able to carry all the things he needs in a backpack; that'a difficult even for fully-grown adults), but that's not the universe your characters live in. 

      So you have the choice of either making the environment so unchallenging that a ten year old could do it, or making your ten year olds mature enough to do it, or retconning canon. You chose the right option IMO. (It's definitely the most frequently chosen option by fanfic writers.)

      Literary characters also don't have to speak and act in a perfectly realistic way; that would get boring quickly. Just don't make a big deal out of it by having other characters continuously point out how mature they are, or something. (Your characters can be exceptionally precocious even in canon, sure, but the basics of taking a pokemon journey and all the life skills that entails shouldn't be remarkable. And you haven't treated it as remarkable thus far, so I don't know what this reviewer is talking about.) And they wouldn't be so much more believable just because they're a few years older, anyway. (Actually I think a lot of people take a dip in maturity around 13/14/15 as they are faced with a lot of new emotions and impulses. Having them be 10/11 is a great way to curb the idea that this will be a story with romantic relationships and sexual drama. Actually, the only good reason I can think of for changing the characters into teenagers is because you wanted to write a story with relationships and sexual drama.)

      Also as for the other review by the same commentator about the science/rationality exposition dumps--well, that's part of why I *love* the story, so my two cents are to leave those in. 

      Thanks again for another great chapter. I loved the plot development.

        Yeah, I wish that person signed in so I could respond to them directly.

        I'm actually of two minds on this. On the one hand, I'm perfectly fine saying that environmental pressures have made humans in the pokemon world a standard deviation more mature and intelligent than they would be in our world... any kids that didn't treat pokemon like the deadly monsters they are would not have survived the dark ages before pokeballs were invented.

        On the other hand, I honestly do believe that kids, even in our world, raised in certain circumstances, can grow to be as mature as their environment dictates. There are child soldiers in war torn countries that are forced to fight at the age Red and Blue and Leaf are.  Throughout history, boys in particularly military cultures have been trained to fight and kill since pre-adolescence.

        Whether these are the healthiest or best ways to raise children is obviously a different question. But when humanity's survival relies on training children to be  soldiers, they're sure as hell going to be more mature than 21st century western 11 year olds.

        As for intelligence, Red, Blue and Leaf are all gifted youngsters, even among their peers. Perhaps that doesn't account for ALL their intelligence, but I work with kids, and every once in awhile I'll meet an 11 or 12 year old who's more intelligent and well spoken than their older siblings and parents. 

        They're not typical kids, but to me they're realistic enough :)

          You know, sorry to ping you on an old thread, but something happened today to me that really made what you said ring true. I am traveling right now in India, and I met a kid, a ten year old, who took me around and showed me things in the area of the city we're in. He frankly was more street-smart and seemed more inwardly strong than I am (in a way that became even more heartbreaking when he offered to perform sexual acts in exchange for money). He also I guess emotionally manipulated me like a violin even though I was totally aware what he was doing. I am sort of out of sorts over this, but it made your comment about ten year olds acting so adult-like in a war-torn society all the more believable.

  The excerpt at the end implies to me that this world's "Team Rocket" is going to be Giovanni's private gang of renegades. I admire his forsight, I can imagine blog posts like these are useful propaganda after being "exposed." He can argue that he was attempting to reform a corrupt criminal justice system, give the unfairly persecuted a chance at meaningful work. And if he spins the organization as primarily a "theives guild," he has a literal 'historic' justification to argue that it is better to have been organzied theives than lawless murderers.

    Aren't competent antagonists fun? :)
    ```

    - u/PeridexisErrant:
      ```
      No, no, no.  *Reading about* competent characters is fun, *having* a competent antagonist is not.
      ```

      - u/DaystarEld:
        ```
        Oh come on, surely part of you would get some pride and excitement out of having a competent foe, rather than just the mundane and petty kind!

        Am I right, fellas? Eh? Anyone? ...Just me, then? 

        Granted, I've never had a real life arch-nemesis, so I'm just drawing off of experience with games :P Especially tabletop: nothing is more exciting at the RPG table than a smart DM that can craft an intelligent and competent foe.
        ```

        - u/The_Magus_199:
          ```
          Having competent foes is fun *so long as* their competence doesn't actually negatively affect you in the real world. :P

          I mean, trying to outsmart an intelligent GM is fun, but I'm definitely glad I don't have any intelligent people trying to kill me in real life, you know?
          ```

          - u/DaystarEld:
            ```
            Yep. Life is hard enough as it is: if I ever need that much excitement, I'll try sky diving first.

    - u/daydev:

      Funny thing is, until I saw this comment I didn't make the connection that it's from an antagonist. Because a) I think I've seen this parable somewhere, I don't remember where, "for reals" as an illustration why "all crimes are the same" is counter-productive. And b) he has a point in this case in my opinion. It would be understandable if committing a crime using Pokemon (any crime, murder, arson, jaywalking) was seen as a serious aggravating circumstance, but to make it into its own kind of evil outside the normal justice? Maybe I'm not grasping properly the mindset of a world filled with monster and without effective means to fight them until recently, but on the other hand there's already a "Pokemon lives matter" sentiment (as represented by Leaf).  

      Edit: I don't know how faithful to canon this presentation on Renegades, and their treatment by society is. I have only fuzzy memories about team Rocket from the animation series I watched years ago. I've no other exposure to Pokemon canon except Pop-Cultural Osmosis.
      ```

      - u/DaystarEld:
        ```
        I definitely took the parable from somewhere, but I can't for the life of me remember where. I did some quick googling to try and find it, but it was probably somewhere on LessWrong or SlateStarCodex about perverse incentives. 

        In any case, "antagonist" might be too strong a word :) I purposefully avoided "villain," but even if I hadn't, remember that just because someone's values don't align with the protagonist/hero doesn't mean they're wrong about everything.

        It's pretty much not faithful at all to any of the canons I'm aware of. The anime's response to Team Rocket was to treat them as mostly a nuisance, and the games never show any comeuppance for the various evil teams' criminal acts: for the most part they just lose their battles and leave of their own volition, or lose the "heart" to do villainy, as if they didn't just try to destroy the planet or take over the world or whatever, and society wouldn't maybe take some steps to ensure that they're not going to do so again.

  Hey guys, welcome back! Super long chapter to make up for last month's brevity. Couple of notes: First, my website is almost ready to go, and patrons are going to get a sneak peek sometime this month. Thanks to everyone for your continued support!

  Second, I'm in the last planning stages of a podcast on rationalist writing, which I'm pretty excited about. Episode topics will include everything from rational writing tips and discussion to reviews of media, rational or not, as well as feedback for listener's work, eventually. My co-host /u/alexanderwales and I have a lot to talk about on the subject, but any suggestions on specifics you'd like to hear about can be added to The List!

  And finally, once again, if you leave a review that expects or justifies a response, please make an account and log in first! I don't mind anonymous reviews at all, but I've gotten some great reviews full of excellent questions and critiques that were sadly posted by guest accounts, preventing me from replying. I appreciate every review you guys leave, especially the long and detailed ones, so give me the chance to at least say thanks in return!

  That's it for now. Hope you enjoy the chapter, and stay tuned in at /r/rational for updates on the website or podcast later this month!

  Is it just me, or does Red have trouble keeping pokemon alive? It seems like he's lost at least one in every major conflict they've been in. I know that it's a small sample size, with only the 'chu rampage and the paras rampage so far, but it does seem to be a trend.
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    To be fair, the hoothoot wasn't really his fault :) But yes, most trainers have trouble keeping all their pokemon alive through major threats. I see the world of pokemon as an inherently dangerous place, as the whole point of raising pokemon to fight is to help keep trainers alive against deadly forces.
    ```

    - u/Lugnut1206:
      ```
      This is much better than the pokemon being glorified fighting dogs.
      ```

      - u/DaystarEld:
        ```
        Right? How downplayed the threats of the world are is something that always bothered me about the anime or games.
        ```

    - u/noggin-scratcher:
      ```
      It occurs to me that this is essentially the world that a Nuzlocke run attempts to simulate. Even down to the rule about always naming your Pokemon.
      ```

      - u/DaystarEld:
        ```
        Yeah. The concept of Nuzlocke is so popular not just for a "hard mode," but because there's a great demand for more mature and realistic pokemon experiences. The idea of pokemon "fainting" after getting blasted by a flamethrower or slammed by a 2 ton rock monster is ridiculous even to children.
        ```

  - u/empocariam:
    ```
    I think its a combination of two factors. I imagine even top tier trainers like rangers or ACEs lose quite a few "fodder" pokemon like spearows and rattattas, which creates a bottleneck like effect, resulting in only the incredibly skilled Fearows making the cut, or they end up with ridiculously powerful monsters like Charizards.  
    Also, Red's speciality was never Pokémon battling, he is primarily a researcher who by the necissity of travel, must put some effort into battling just to survive.

  Quick question... why was it necessary to exterminate the parasect? Seems like that was most of the population in the mountain, meaning this could amount to regional genocide. Wouldn't it have been safer for people and pokemon to just let them spread? Unless I'm mistaken there aren't many settlements near Mount Moon, and the parasect weren't a direct threat to the mining operation. 

  Love the introduction of Renegades, and the poke at Team Rocket ("They don't walk around with a big red R on their shirt.") Giovanni's blog at the end was particularly well-written.
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    The paras colony will occasionally go on spreading sprees that can balloon their population out of control. This was indeed quite a lot of paras that got killed, which is unfortunate from an ecological standpoint, but they would have simply spread over the entire mountain if left unchecked and done their own damage to local species that would get displaced into nearby areas and do their own disruption and so on.

    Natural predators and lack of sufficient nutrients would eventually shrink the colony's population to a more normal size once their spore season was over, but that can take months of the mountain side being dangerously inhospitable and even harder to pass through.

    The mountain is fairly large though, and there are other colonies in it.

  Another excellent chapter, I get bummed at the end of every one. 

  This chapter had me think of Charmander in the show flaming Exeggutor and got me wondering on how exactly you will handle evolution. Look forward to finding out.

  Hi there, I came across this story a little over month ago, caught up and can't wait for more!

  Just a quick question, I know the Fairy type has been brought up but what are your thoughts on Mega Evolution? I understand if/why it's not in the story, but I'm curious as to how you'd try to rationally explain or work around the "strong bond" needed to activate it.
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    Thanks, glad you're enjoying it!

    I think the bond in Mega Evolution would probably be more sentiment than anything: as far as I'm aware, there hasn't been anyone in the games or anime that had both power stones but weren't able to mega evolve their pokemon. I would be happy to make it canon if, for example, the games won't let you mega evolve a pokemon without a certain level of friendship or hearts, but since you can just catch or get traded a pokemon and mega-evolve them right away with the right stones, I don't see any reason to think it's true.
    ```

    - u/Rouninscholar:
      ```
      On thinking of this, if it induced an emotional or mental change with the pokemon, be it rage, or giddyness, or the feeling of being almost all powerful. Then it might be that anyone in the know keeps them out if the hands of trainers who aren't capable, that pokemon become harder to control when it happens and for some time after.
      ```

      - u/DaystarEld:
        ```
        That makes sense too: I like the idea of a shadowy coven of Mega Evolution stone holders, being careful about whom they release the stones to and judging trainers by their bond with their pokemon :) I might actually hint toward that way later in the story... If so, give me a name you'd like me to use to give you a shoutout!

  And I'm a couple days late again. But I've got to drop in and say great job. Fantastic chapter with the right mix of drama and action, combined with points of tension spread just far enough to keep it compelling but not too far that any of it felt like you had drawn the pace out. 

  I really enjoy seeing your take on realistic challenges presented by the different species of Pokemon. It's refreshing to see how Pokemon as weak as paras in game can be a disaster under the right circumstances. Too many writers require a horde of gyarados before its called an emergency. 

  With regards to your Renegades, are they investigated and tried in a court like in the world we know? Or are they just labelled as that and the word spreads to be careful of them? And if it is some kind of official crime, what kind of punishment do they recieve? You mentioned Hunters. Would that be like a bounty hunter type job? 

  Again great chapter!

  I'm glad somebody finally included the factor that the paras breed like something out of the Last of Us. I'm guessing Red's spearow is KIA as well?

  > Stupid, she said to say something if you're *not* clear.

  Not so stupid; those who are *not* clear would be the ones most likely to be *unable* to respond.
  The original question might be considered badly/stupidly phrased though.
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    That makes sense until you consider that their priority is not those who can't respond: the cloud is going whether they're in the way or not, but they don't have time for any rescue attempts, and at the very most they can give an extra 10-20 seconds if there's someone in the path that is almost clear.

  Hey I've got a big comment for you man! I found your fanfic online a while back, and I had never read one before so I though: "okay,I'll dabble and just see if I like it." well, 31 chapters later I can't get enough! I have seriously fallen in love with this! I can't begin to explain my disappointment when I got to chapter 29... When, in the top section you said "Sun and Moon Hype!" My heart sank.... "Sun and Moon? But that means this was written extremely recently! But the story isn't over! And that means I have to wait to see how my new favorite story is going to pan out!"..... Though as much as that pained me, I am still in love with this story, I seriously love the realism aspect that the story is lased with inside and out, it's not just a pokemon story and that makes it **seriously** unique and just fantastic! There aren't just battles at stakes, there are lives! Good heavens chapter 31 made me feel like I was in an episode of the Walking Dead! (that's a compliment, if you aren't a fan of it) All in all, You've found a new fan in me and if I have to wait for every new chapter you better believe I'm gonna do it!

    Thank you, I'm glad to hear you've been enjoying it so much! It feels great to introduce someone to the world of fanfiction in a way that I was too: a rationalist fiction :) If you're impatient for the next chapter and want to read something similar meanwhile, check out [my other story on fanfiction](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9676374/1/Daystar-s-Remix-of-Rationality): it's a re-write of the first 4 chapters of Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality, which was one of the major inspirations for this story. If you like those 4 chapters, you can find the rest of the story (written by the original author) here:

    Hope you enjoy it!

    Out of curiosity, where did you run across my story if you weren't frequenting fanfiction before? Was it somewhere else on reddit, or a different site?
