  Once you hit Chapter 42, you finally hit the true Rationalist pitch. All the things we thought would be smarter to do if you had a Superman are put forward.

  The writing is pretty good too.

  I'm already 5 chapters in and so far this has great promise.  Excellent writing so far and a fascinating premise.
