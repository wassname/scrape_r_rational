  Can anyone provide input on this serial? How is it? Seen it here quite a bit, but without too much discussion.

    It's pretty good, just a little slow imo. It's been almost 20 chapters, and it feels like not a lot has happened.

      I think all of the interludes aren't helping.  Current ratio is 18 MC-centric chapters to 8 interludes, which... at this point, I wouldn't even call them "interludes" so much as "constant interruptions to the narrative."
      ```
