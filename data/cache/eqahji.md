## What Rational Isekai are there?

### Post:

Do we have a comprehensive list of all the "Transported to another World' rationalistic fiction? The only one I'm aware of is Vacant Throne, edit: and Worth the Candle. 

&#x200B;

I've heard rumor that John (Wildbow) McCrae was considering to write an Isekai since he's displeased with the genre and its existing content.

  Delve is kinda rational. That said, it's also a litrpg that gets quite math-y at points, but the mc drawing up tables to work out the efficiency of combinations of mana expenditure rather than just winging it is quite nice.

    Unlike most, I didn't find Delve much rational. Sure, Rain uses math and experiments to figure out the details of his skills, but otherwise, I felt like the system and world both were bending backwards for his build to work.

  Try Worth the Candle, its not the usual 'Isekai', but definitely 'rational'

  Its almost weird that you asked that here and wasn't aware of it.

    Yes definitely worth the candle. It's not traditional, but then rational fiction rarely is. It definitely hits the same ideas and tropes as the classic ones though.

  >I've heard rumor that John (Wildbow) McCrae was considering to write an Isekai

  He already did. Worm Arc 17: Migration.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Arc 17 is to Isekai is what Wildbow's books are to teen romance.
    ```

    - u/chiruochiba:
      ```
      I... can't tell if that analogy is a positive or negative one.
      ```

      - u/dianthus-amurensis:
        ```
        I think it's just spot on. They're both more painful versions. Arc 17 of Worm is like an isekai but without the wish fulfillment. You get the powers in another world and you fight over the girl, but the girl is dying, you're pursued by people who outclass and outnumber you, and you're losing your mind.

        Same thing with the teen romances in Worm and Ward. Take Krouse and Noelle from Arc 17 alone. You've got a cute story about a girl gamer and the boy she wants to join her MOBA team, but before they can become competitive, they get teleported to another planet, she gets impaled, and she gets turned into a monster. Oh, and she's got an eating disorder, and as much as Krouse dedicates the rest of his sentient life to protecting and trying to fix her, I'm pretty sure they never even shared a kiss. Sure, he's as dedicated to her as any teenage boy would ever be to his girlfriend - to the point that he's willing to toss away the lives of the other members of their MOBA team for her well being, even after she's become a killer.

        Don't even get me started on how Krouse and Noelle are a microcosmic reflection of the male and female lead of Worm, either.

              ```
              >!Scion!< could count as a lead, in the sense that he's critical to the story, but if we're picking foreshadowing, his character arc more closely mirrors >!Taylor's father!< than Krouse.
              ```

            - u/Robert_Barlow:
              ```
              Yes, I know that. The sentence I'm referring to is "...Krouse and Noelle are a microcosmic reflection of the male and female lead of Worm..." I'm going to assume that in order for them to be a *microcosmic reflection* of the male and female lead of Worm, he was talking about two people *other* than Krouse and Noelle.

  Lord of the Mysteries (Boxnovel is a good place to read it) is one of my favorites stories. The characters all feel like they have their own interests, and they work towards them. The main character doesn't feel like the only motive force in the world, and he makes use of a lot of deduction to figure things out. It's set in a sort of not!London as the industrial era is going into swing, but there's also a magic system that takes inspiration from occult and hermetic ideas, with a good dash of Xianxia progression. The english translation is in the higher tier of translations of this kind, so it's not perfect, and there are a few idiosyncrasies that may be a little off putting until you get used to them.
  ```

  - u/Rice_22:
    ```
    For a translated from Chinese work the translation is okay. For people used to native English works they may find the word choice a bit weird. For example, "lampoon" has become somewhat of a silly meme amongst fans.

    Even still it's worth reading simply for Klein (the MC)'s step-by-step logical inferences/deduction, his moral character, and his desperate struggles to find his way out of one huge evil cult conspiracy only to stumble right into the next one while pretending it was his intent all along.
    ```

    - u/Walloping:
      ```
      I wasn't going to mention lampoon or glabella. I feel like they've actually decreased over time, but maybe it's just a case of having gotten used to them. Your second paragraph is a good way to put it without spoiling too much too.

  Oof. I was going to say "Erfworld," but when I went there to link to it I discovered that it was apparently taken down due to some major tragedy in that author's life. That sucks.

  If you can find a backup somewhere, it's basically an online webcomic that's rationalish, high on munchkinery. I only read the first "season" but it was pretty good.

        A dissenting opinion:

        The pace of the plot has gradually slowed down as the author devoted more screentime to worldbuilding and the inner-lives of characters, but to me that wasn't a negative. I've still found the story fascinating and engaging, full of suspense, intrigue and creative munchkinry all the way through book 4

        Regarding art: The art style has gone through iterations as the comic switched penciler/inker/colorist, but it has never deviated far from the original, and the quality has always been consistently high compared to most amateur webcomics - or even professional published comics - that I've seen over the years. In my opinion the art never detracted from the story.

        However, I would caution potential new readers that the words-to-pictures ratio eventually transitions from 'paneled comic with word-bubbles' into 'novel with illustrations' à la  Neil Gaiman's *Stardust*.
        ```

  ```
  "Isekai" is essentially the Japanese term for what western publishers & audiences have been calling "Portal Fantasy" for decades.

  How much of this is "Rational" I have no idea, but it might help your searches.
  ```

- u/Geminii27:
  ```
  I guess one of the problems is that even with ratfic isekai you tend to need the protagonist to be given some enormous advantage in the new world for them to be effective - give me but a lever long enough and a place to stand, kind of thing. Simply having advanced knowledge (even comprehensive knowledge, like being a super-engineer in a medieval world) isn't necessarily going to get you anywhere in one lifetime.

  It's possible to have a super-rationalist protagonist who latches onto some superpower or equivalent in the new world and makes it their bitch, but then there's the trap of falling into the fic merely being a rant about how all of the original superpower users (assuming it's a pre-existing fictional world with its own canon stories) were complete dumbasses who never once sat down and really *thought* about how they could use their superpower to best effect. Which can come across as kind of missing the point about the original setting; mainly, that it was not about that kind of story.

  And then, of course, there's *realistic* isekai, which might not be rational but which has the problem that the protagonist gets dumped into a new world and rapidly plowed under by the setting, plot, weirdnesses, language barriers, and other things. It's difficult to write in an engaging manner (although I have seen it done), particularly in settings which aren't terribly kind to random foreigners with few applicable skills.

    ... one idea free for stealing.
    Modern person gets ported into a medieval world, and after about a week, redlines completely with rage at the infinite injustices, and starts working to fix things like an obsessive demon on a cocktail of adderal and modafinil. This person is *not* our protag. 

    That person may, or may not be dead. 

    Certainly "their" capture, trial and gruesome execution has happened no less than 9 separate times. Getting the right person being somewhat of a challenge since they do their work under pseudonym, and via very creative cutouts. 

    Our protag is a teenage native who has picked up the insanely illegal habit of collecting all the pamphlets published by Hiero Protagonia. Because there is so much useful stuff in them. Also terrifyingly persuasive arguments why you should burn down all the castles, and shoot priests on sight, but eh, best manuals in all of existence for practical chemistry!

    > Simply having advanced knowledge (even comprehensive knowledge, like being a super-engineer in a medieval world) isn't necessarily going to get you anywhere in one lifetime.

    Medical knowledge could do the trick.

    It's easy to put to immediate valuable use (once you've solved the initial language etc. issues). In any random village there's going to be ailments that the local herb-person doesn't know how to cure, whose victims might be desperate enough to accept a stranger's advice. 

    Advice works and you graduate to actual help. Your lack of modern antibiotics and surgical equipment (plus ignorance of local herbs) is crippling but plausibility not *as* crippling as the average steam-engine nerd. Do a few more successful cures and you acquire a reputation and some wealth. Work at it long enough, and desperate nobles might give you a chance.

    From then you can propose simple, cheap hygiene reforms that will massively decrease the amount of deadly diseases in large cities and army camps. The later is a Big Deal in the middle ages, when so so much of warfare is about besieging impregnable fortifications and waiting for one side or the other to be too disease-ridden to hold. With a rich patron, the right nerdy knowledge, and years of hard work, it's also just barely possible to reinvent penicillin or some vaccines.

    I have seen this done once with the Naruto fanfic [Sanitize](https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12431866/1/Sanitize), which I guess I've now spoiled for you but it's still a pretty good read. The protagonist isn't granted any superpowers (in a setting where those exist, even!) or contrived coincidences, and in fact labours under the serious handicap of being female in a sexist society, so it's a lifetime of work for fairly modest achievements.

      [Jin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jin_(manga)) is a good example of this. You have a modern Japanese surgeon transported back in time to the Meiji Restoration period, and he has to improvise and reconstruct his tools; and a lot of attention is paid to the economics and politics of healthcare, how to organise people to contain disease outbreaks, etc..

  Hear the Silence by EmptySurface 

  It's a Naruto Isekai set before the events in the anime.  It's not an uplift type story but instead addresses the emotional and social ramifications of child soldiers and constant warfare. I've enjoyed it very much so far, the writing is good; it does start somewhat slowly though, and there's lots of introspection and downtime between "action sequences."

  The anime / Light novel Log Horizon is not really rational, per se. But a lot of people are isekaid, and first is about learing how to exist individually in a world very different from them and at its core trying to build a functional society and understand the intricacies of the world >!and how it is slowly changing since the isekai day.  !< Caveat emptor, its still an anime and has things people could consider annoying, and the three first episodes are quite boring but a  necessary explanation of the game's rules; but when its focus is on the world its a blast. Lots of cool ideas well executed. Havent read the LN but im sure the good things are still there.

  Does the sword-art-online setting count as Isekai? It's another world of a sort, but I suppose the entire population is made up of transported humans.

  I'd recommend [Fairy Dance of Death](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8679666/1/Fairy-Dance-of-Death). It sets the death game of Sword art online in the more pvp centric world of Alfheim Online, where players are less incentivized to work together, and adds a layer of politics.

    I think the original season sorta does, as being stuck in a virtual world is really no different from being stuck in a fantasy world. 

    But in some other seasons they can log off, and i think at some level, the "stuck" bit is a part of the genre.

  ```
  Plugging [Release That Witch](https://m.wuxiaworld.co/Release-that-Witch/) again.  I think it's got a good amount of rational elements to it, even if it doesn't necessarily reach the bar well enough to call it ratfic.

  Copy-pasting my past review:


  Release That Witch is an uplift isekai. A mechanical engineer wakes up one day in the body  of a loser prince in a Medieval setting, only to discover that the  witches being hunted by the church actually have magic powers. He attracts them to his banner and uses them to industrialize the region, eventually wielding modern processes and tech against knights, the church, and other supernatural forces in the world.

  I felt it did a great job not just uplifting, but in explaining the mechanics behind various technologies and how they might be used in a low-tech setting. It *does* trend to the power fantasy side of things, but all in all tends to at least  ensure that the MC has to pay for each resounding victory with a slog of  R&D failures first.

  And I dunno man. There's just something viscerally *satisfying* about watching snooty knights and nobles get roflstomped with heavy artillery.

  This is a Chinese translation and suffers from middling grammar, odd phrasing, bad formatting, and strange punctuation, as well as occasional chapter order mess ups. If you can overlook all that, tho, it's a  satisfying piece of work.

  Oh, also no harem, minimal romantic bullshit.
  ```

  - u/Geminii27:
    ```
    It's not bad, but I feel it suffers a little bit from deus ex machina - new witches with surprisingly plot-relevant powers keep turning up precisely when it would be most useful in the uplift process for them to do so. They're rather thinly disguised plot devices to allow the protagonist to skip over decades or centuries of slow process, design, or material refinement in order to access the next step of industrial revolution, and the next, and the next...

    He's not able to jump straight from medieval times to microprocessors and nuclear power, but it does sort of feel a bit like visiting a tech tree's stations of the canon, or perhaps a History of Engineering, at a vastly accelerated rate thanks to the witches.

  Would Dungeon Defense be rational? Every character is very smart and thorough with their plans, even the more boneheaded of them like Barbatos. There’s some pretty clever ideas like undermining humanity’s union through their class disparities, but perhaps the fact that every character is also pretty much insane would disqualify the series. At least, it’s a lot more rational than a lot of other isekai out there, for what that’s worth.

  It's not rational per-se, but I'd consider With This Ring to be rational-adjacent at times. It's a DC (Young Justice in particular, but he takes stuff from the DC setting as a whole along with interpreting a lot of stuff in his own way and making it better) self-insert story, and I guess I'd consider it an Isekai since he's transported to this world (and has fairly extensive knowledge of it). The author shares the rational community's distaste with stupidity in fiction, and writes accordingly, but I definitely wouldn't go so far as to call it rational. I haven't been reading it for a while though, since it turns out the author is transphobic garbage, so I can't comment on the newest stuff.

  If you can seperate the art from the artist though, most of the story is decent and it has some cool plotlines that make it very good even if you know little to nothing about DC. It takes a little time to get going though, and it has some weird quirks that take getting used to (for example the parallel Paragon and Renegade timelines, which start out with only minor differences but eventually butterfly out into becoming completely different stories. The Renegade timeline starts out edgy and kinda bad, but his story gets really good after the stories diverge more).
  ```

  - u/eaglejarl:
    ```
    Leaving aside the transphobia, I disrecommend WTR purely due to the writing.  On the small scale, the author feels a need to use weird idiosyncratic rules like 'names of species are always capitalized' ("I walked past the Ivy-covered wall to where my pet Tiger waited"), randomly invents new punctuation, makes heavy use of colored text to show emotional content instead of just...you know, *showing* the emotional content. Etc.

    Still, those are relatively small issues. Beyond that is the standard problem of rational fixfic that gets our community slammed all the time: Only the protagonist is rational, ever.  When he arrives, the rest of the setting is exactly as ridiculous as the comics are, but okay, that's the point. From then on, however, people remain their comic-book selves instead of becoming proactive and forethoughtful to match him.

    Then there's the main character. It's labeled as an SI but I really hope that the author is taking the piss out of himself, because Paul (the protagonist) is so oblivious that it feels like a comedy. He literally walks into a room full of guys with guns and drugs and fails to realize that it's a drug deal. Half the female characters in the story practically throw themselves at him and he doesn't even notice. Likewise, he engages in activities that are consensual and not explicitly sexual, but still very uncomfortable to read when you consider that he's a mid-20s (30s?) man who de-aged himself enough that he's passing for 18 on a team with a bunch of younger-than-18 kids. (Although it depends on how you count in she cases.) Suggesting to a 16-year-old girl that she should take her top off in order to distract him into dropping his shield. Offering massages and hair-brushing to distraught young women who clearly find him attractive... None of it is over the line, but it's still cringy.

    Not only is Paul oblivious and slightly squicky, his actions don't align well with his stated goals. He claims his goal is "make the world better in an effective way instead of just doing the same righteous face punching that the other heroes are doing." To help with that, he's got a power ring that can do almost literally anything as long as he wants it strongly enough. The ring has an AI in it to help him. It doesn't have a full database of galactic tech, but Paul doesn't even think to say "hey, go on arXiv and post a full dump of all the basic math you know" or "hey,
    without breaking any laws or doing anything that would compromise my other activities, find all the evidence you can against everyone in the FBI Most Wanted list and forward it to the relevant agents. Do that as a background task from now on. Oh, and do the same for Interpol and as many other criminals as you can, in priority order based on minimum sentence requirements."

    Next, there's the Renegade storyline. Ugh. Paul is a nice guy, very prosocial, works within the system to cause change. Still, that's not as fun as straight power fantasy, so the author periodically steps away from the main storyline to write a little bit of AU "hey, what if I was a selfish jackass who cared only about maximizing his own power? And what if I always succeeded on the first try and there were never any consequences of any kind?" (The Renegade storyline does eventually improve somewhat, but it takes a loooong time.)

    I could go on, but this is enough. The first N chapters of WTR are a lot of fun in a comedy/action/adventure-movie sort of way, but I find it sours after that. Different people will have different values for N, and some people may even have an N > max-chapter-number.

    For the record, the whole transphobic thing turned out to be way overblown. Basically he had very strong views on semantics and didn't understand that the helicopter joke was actually offensive. 

    There was definitively some wanton ignorance involved there and transphobic elements were definitely part of it, but then after he moved forums, and during the time he was still pissed at the whole situation, the arc continued and this was a subject throughout most of it and it was definitively not transphobic.

      Refusing to use the right pronouns for trans people unless they get surgery is 100% transphobic.

        It is definitely transphobic, but personally I'm a bit uncomfortable with how easy it is to be labeled "transphobic garbage" based on it. If you support trans rights and see nothing wrong with being trans, being called a transphobe because you have some really stupid views on semantics seems...wrong. Labelling is such an important part of the trans movement that it bothers me how cavalier some people are to throw around labels when discussing it.

        This is really hard to put into words so I apologise if I word something poorly. While my personal views are very progressive I spend quite a bit of time on the internet and I feel like it's important to self-reflect on different viewpoints and labels to avoid becoming part of the "twitter rabble" that isn't very well connected to the real world. People have very different views, deciding that someone is a transphobe because their views and vocabulary doesn't line up completely with the woke crowd online just serves to make the club feel more exclusive rather than help anyone or change any minds. This isn't like someone saying the N-word or saying that trans people are mostly perverts trying to get into bathrooms, this is someone arguing over semantics over something that hasn't been in the public consciousness  for very long. Arguing over that while not denying the feelings or reality of trans people is, in my opinion, problematic without actually being intolerant. 

        I do remember that he made an apology over sharing helicopter memes. It's been a while but as I remember it he said he was pissed about people suspending him and calling him a transphobe over this and it was only later that he found out how awful those are. Again though, the absolute majority of people who don't spend time in very progressive forums/circles probably don't consider helicopter memes as being particularly bad either.

      tbh, I don't think this is worth bringing up. Regardless of the truth value of your comment, I think it had too high of a chance to spawn a political discussion, which is significantly off-topic for this sub.

        Well that discussion seems to have happened and finished already. With that said, it’s the comment I responded to that shouldn’t have brought it up in that case. If someone says that a (semi) rational fix is worth discounting due to the authors political views, a response should not be withheld just to avoid a political discussion, especially when it’s highly debatable if the author even holds those views.

        The rules cannot be that anyone can claim that any author brought up in this sub is “garbage” and then forbid anyone from disputing that claim out of fear that the conversation will turn political, nor can the rules state that discussing authorial intent isn’t relevant to the work itself. If this results in the occasional debate then so be it. I doubt that it will become common enough to be a problem.
        ```

        - u/causalchain:
          ```
          I think it's better to respond to a political comment with a "please don't insert political views into the recommendation", or with a reddit link to a previous discussion on the topic to inform others.
          ```

          - u/LordSwedish:
            ```
            But the political discussion could actually be relevant to the work though. If this author actually was transphobic and inserted those views into the work, you should tell people about that when bringing up the work as a recommendation. If that’s not the case, an entire work of fiction was just written off by a lot of people due to what’s essentially libel and nobody is allowed to respond.

    it's hard to "separate the story from the author" when his sentiments on the matter were directly written into the story

      Agreed, which is why I dropped it. But there is a lot of good story too, and I'm not gonna judge someone for NOT dropping it.
