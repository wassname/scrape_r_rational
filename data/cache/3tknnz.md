## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  Do you bother to save copies of fanfiction that you read? Which have you saved?

  ---

  Currently, I have exactly one hundred and fifty .epub files of fanfiction ([an up-to-date list](http://pastebin.com/hZ7uaQnr)--numbers won't match, since some books are multi-volume and some files are collections). I haven't read quite *all* of them, but I've probably read more than ninety-five percent of them. I don't save every story that's in my FanFiction and FIMFiction lists of "favorites" (summing to 277 and 197 stories, respectively), however.
  ```

  - u/Transfuturist:
    ```
    1322 documents in Calibre. Estimated 40% FIMFiction HTMLs renamed to text, 20% textbooks and research papers, 10% published novels, and 20% other fanfiction downloaded with Calibre. Almost all of it on Kindle.
    ```

    When I was younger, I had limited computer internet access, and I didn't have a cellphone. Plus, back then, smartphones weren't a thing. They didn't start rising in prominence until the early 2010's where I grew up. So I use to manually copy and paste FF.net fics into a notepad file (fuck those authors that had like 100+ chapter fics :( ), parse them with a program called jsplit into 4 KB chunks and read them on my 1st gen ipod Nano. The notes program didn't let you read past 4 KB back then, hence the need for splitting. I say that to say, I USED to be a determined little bastard about saving my favorite fanfics, for later perusal.

    Now, I mostly don't bother, as the only reason I'd have to save them is if I lacked an internet connection, as I figure I'll remember or re-stumble across any fanfiction that's worth a re-read. And since I have data on my phone (and prefer to read on it anyway) and wifi at both home and work, there's little reason for me to save them. I do, however, have a number of novels on my kindle app that I've downloaded, such as the Name of the Wind series of books, the Martian, the Tao of Badass, etc.

    Well not as such, but my favourite stories tabs on ff, sv and sb serve much the same purpose. For example I've got [60](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/6573368/Jackercracks) on ff.

  I'm looking for some people to collaborate on groupware. I want a self-hosted alternative to google products, with the ability to do custom branding.

  Everyone involved would have root on the server.

  There's a lot of work involved in getting tools to co-operate, so it makes sense for some hackery types to collaborate.

  Things I'd like to see

   * Centralized single-sign-on. This would most likely take the form of a django app, authenticating against PAM (local unix accounts) and things like facebook, github, whatever. Using python social auth. It would provide an oauth authentication endpoint for other services we run. We could just set up LDAP, a lot of things support it, but I hope this will provide more flexibility.

   * Rocket chat, as an IRC bouncer and a way to talk to clients.

   * seafile, as a dropbox alternative.

   * Email, using mailur.

   * Web hosting, for any clients or blogs. Using nginx.

   * Git hosting, probably just using ssh.

  There's a lot of sysadmin stuff, and it's my hope it could be divided amongst a few people who do this kind of thing. Basically, run it as a shared unix enviroment for some tech professionals who want self-hosted solutions.

  Anyone interested?

    Is this a money thing?

    > Everyone involved would have root on the server.

    Bad idea.
    ```

    - u/traverseda:

      It's a "systems administration is time consuming" thing. I don't mind paying for a server, but setting up a bunch of services is potentially a big time sink. I know there are other people who want self-hosted alternatives, so it makes sense to share the responsibility for them.

      Think of it as communal housing, but for personal servers. You need to trust the other tenants at least a bit.

      As for everyone involved having root, I'm imagining this would be a handful of people who more or less trust each other. Their real names would obviously be known.

      I already give root out to contractors occasionally, because it's the only reasonable way to handle stuff if you're not doing everything yourself. This isn't really that different.

      Shared unix environments are fine, especially with frequent backups and public key authentication.

  Can you recommend some great podcasts or audiobooks? What is the best stuff that you've encountered in the past year? Any type, any genre.

  Also, can you suggest some great comedy to watch/read/listen to?

    (Mostly) Copy/pasted from a similar comment from last week:

    >Some of the podcasts I listen to (that make sense to recommend here):

    >* Hello Internet: "Two-guys talking" podcast about a variety of topics.  Alternates between interesting discussions and somewhat silly jokes/callbacks.  One of the hosts (Grey) is a transhumanist and sometimes says things that make it seem like he has to have read some of Less Wrong.

    >* Cortex, Reconcilable Differences (Two podcasts): Similar in genre to Hello Internet, but a bit less silly. Cortex has Grey from Hello Internet.

    >* ATP: Like the above but with a tech news (esp. Apple) focus. Can be boring if you aren't interested in that, but is often fun anyway.

    >* Rationally Speaking: Julia Galef (CFAR President) has conversations with people about their ideas.

    >* Econtalk: Conversations between Russ Roberts and various economists/people in related fields. Not fun to listen to if you dislike libertarian ideas.

    >* Worm Audiobook and HPMOR Podcast (Two podcasts): Enjoy great stories while doing other things!

    >* Dear Hank and John: Kind of embarrassing to admit, but I like this, even though I stopped watching Vlogbrothers videos a long time ago.

    >* The Weeds: Conversations between journalists about policy issues, rather than politics. Just put out a good episode about Basic Income Guarantees.

    >* StartUp: Short episodes about the business of being a Start Up. Very well produced.

    >* About Race: Occasionally frustrating exercise in overcoming anti-SJW sentiments through exposure therapy / conversations between mostly reasonable sounding people about why race is still a big deal and we should care a lot.

    >* Waking Up with Sam Harris: Smarter and less crazy than you'd think if you've moved away from "New Atheism". Haven't listened to many episodes, but I've enjoyed those I have.

    >General Podcast Tips:

    >* Think of something you like. Now google that thing + "podcast" or just search for that term in itunes or your podcast app.

    >* Slowly increase your listening speed. I listen at 3X speed, and it's great.

    [SAYER,](http://geeklyinc.com/sayer-episode-1-while-you-are-still-paralyzed/) and apparently the other podcasts by that studio. SAYER is dark horror-comedy, and also pretty relaxing.

    Welcome to Night Vale. It's a surrealist horror-comedy podcast.
    ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    Podcasts:

    * 99% Invisible
    * This American Life
    * Here's the Thing

    That's usually enough to get me through occasional long drives (my commute isn't long enough for me to listen to even a short podcast). "Here's the Thing" is of variable quality depending on the guest, but it's usually pretty interesting conversation.
    ```

  - u/AmeteurOpinions:

    Here's a few I haven't seen other people mentioned:

    * *Death, Sex & Money* is fantastic podcast about the things people love to think about but never talk about.

    * *Radiolab* does long-form reporting on fascinating stories.

    * *In Our Time* is a show sponsored by the BBC (I think) about a huge range of scientific, historical and philosophical topics.

  Speaking of japanesegameshows, has anyone seen Takeshi's Castle? It's what MXC was based off of, to give it some context.

  Watching it in the original japanese with subs is pretty fun. They're all like "Try your best!". It's very endearing. I find MXC pretty unpleasant, but Takeshi's Castle is alright.

  Does anyone else here also like making plans that can extend years in length?

  It doesn't have to be to extensive, just something at the minimum of making reservations at that expensive theater for next year, pledging a Kickstarter project that won't pay out for years, saving money over the course of years to pay for a new car, or anything where you know that you won't see any sort of payout for a long time.

  Because I hypothesize that people who are more rational will have a greater amount of self-control for delayed gratification, and one super quick and crude way IMHO to estimate self-control is to see if people here are more likely to make very long-term plans.

    I admit that it's way fun to steeple my fingers, pretend to be Gendo Ikari or Tzeentch, and then, years later, stand in the shower and realize that the broad strokes have gone JUST AS PLANNED, AHAHAHAHAHAAAAAA!!!!!

    For instance, this year I've actually finished grad school, got a fairly cool real job, and started volunteering in the lab where I want to do my PhD.

    But oftentimes the real pride is when details work out better than you did plan or could have planned, and yet did so because of something you did.
    ```

  - u/electrace:
    ```
    When it comes to things like reservations, the problem I have is that I don't know where I'll be in a year. Maybe my preferences change and I don't want to go to that expensive theater come next year. Maybe I'll be in a foreign country, unable to go. Maybe my wife will be giving birth that day. I don't like to "lock in" my decisions so far ahead of time, because there's too many things that can change over that span of time. However, if I can cancel the plans without penalty, then I'd have no problem making the reservation.

    Well yeah, most things worth doing take years to play out.

  I won't be at the New York Secular Solstice this year, because a friend of mine is making a Solstice in Washington.  He says he wants less Unitarian Universalist-style pseudohumanism and more straight-up transhumanism.

  And he's letting me suggest things for readings and songs.

  Leonard Cohen's *Who by Fire* is very plausibly going in there.

  I promise to appear there in my True Form.  If you think my True Form is a Kamina cosplay, that's your problem.
