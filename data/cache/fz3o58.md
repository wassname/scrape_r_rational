## [WIP][RT] You may enjoy An Advance In Time if you like tech growth and innovation

### Post:

I’ve started posting a story that I’ve been conceptualizing, planning, and researching off and on for a couple years. Yeah, I like books with adventure, but more than that I *love* books that focus on kingdom building, invention, and technological innovation to overcome those challenges. So I wrote one. 

I’ve got a bit of engineering background but had to do so much research on chemistry, human physiology, and technology to make this not just vaguely plausible but truly believable. I’m having a lot of fun with it, actually, and growing as a writer.

  Haven't really read anything yet since I usually wait until stories have 200-300 pages, but I would seriously consider rewriting the summary. It told me nothing about the story except it involves someone named Jason making advances in technology, probably using nanotechnology.

  I don't know what the world is like (is it modern, was he transported to the past and has to recreate technology, is he at the forefront of a singularity, etc.) Most importantly, it doesn't grab me. I think it's because it's too meta, in the sense that it's talking about what the story is about from a meta narrative perspective instead of letting us have a look from inside the world.

  In any case, I'll be checking this out sometime soon considering the dearth of new rational content during the lockdown. So good luck!

  I just read through all the chapters in one go and I wanted to say awesome job so far. I'm really liking the direction it's going. It's kind of like those incremental games, but much much more entertaining. I can't wait to see where this goes, and can't wait for the next update. Great job!

    Glad you like it, and thanks for the encouragement! I should have another chapter out later tonight. I’m in a writing frenzy. :)

    And another one, because I’m a glutton for punishment and I really wanted to make that first milestone for the challenge. Which I did!

  Solid prose and an interesting start. I have to admit that the company deciding that a time-compressed medieval survival adventure is a good use of AI time was a bit of a strain on suspension of disbelief, but it's justified enough that some allowances can be made in the name of a cool premise.

  I'm always a sucker for industrialization, so I think I'll be watching this.
