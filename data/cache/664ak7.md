  What does this have to do with rational fiction? How does this submission fit the subreddit rules?

  You can find the appeals forum here: https://forums.spacebattles.com/forums/appeals.70/

  Before making an appeal, please read the stickied thread: https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/must-read-appeals-forum-rules-and-useage.322206/

  Make sure you're familiar with the forum rules here: https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-rules-of-spacebattles-important-info-and-announcements-archive-read-this.309653/

  Lastly, consider moving to Sufficient Velocity, a forum that shares the same userbase and was formed in response to poor moderation practices on SB. Appeals on Sufficient Velocity that are denied can be appealed again to an elected body, the community council, and the moderation there is generally more active and engaged with the users. https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/
