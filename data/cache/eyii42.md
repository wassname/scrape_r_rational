  One can only assume that the Gods are very, very weird at this point, especially depending on whether or not they get more or less powerful depending on how much their spells are used.

  Neat idea, basically becomes post scarcity very quickly.

  The idea of how an economy would work when some prices are platonically embedded in the universe is fascinating, particularly as it seems to act instantly across the universe

  If we're interpreting "worth X gp" as "the average person would trade X gp for that thing", can you manipulate prices in the other direction? If I ban gold (or specifically gold pieces) within my kingdom except for the gold pieces I mint, can I locally raise the gp value back to same levels, or even much higher values? (To make effects that generate a certain gp value of items useful again - perhaps even extremely strong, depending on how much you could deflate the gp.)

  If magic is pegged specifically to gold, what happened to other precious metals?

  The 5e rules are very explicit about magic items being special and rare, not available for any price; does this function as some sort of compulsion not to sell them? Could lead to a lot of power concentration over time. This might not matter if people are using them as currency directly - you can definitely get paid in magic items as a reward for a quest or something, and you can probably barter with them.

  But also, magic items seem like a really annoying currency, since they're fairly non-fungible - especially in 5e, which has rules for giving generic magic items special secondary effects, if you're using those. 

  How do you go from a commoner to 1st level? There are a lot of house rules for this, but as far as I know no official rules ... except for the sidekick rules in Tasha's, sort of. (Are we ignoring monster stat blocks for NPC spellcasters and the like, which 5e seems to treat differently from actual class levels?)

  Just how common are class levels, anyway? That seems like the biggest factor in how common magic is, and the general shape of the world, leaving aside degenerate munchkin strategies like polymorphing commoners into creatures with spell slots. (Arguably there are canon answers for this implicit in the prices for spellcasting services, scrolls, etc, but you don't seem to be taking price lists as canon.) It makes sense for class levels to be more common if people are deliberately seeking out XP, but also, if XP is actually a requirement there are no high level civilians apart from retired adventurers. Seems like a recipe for a very militaristic, medieval-y world with adventurers as a warrior caste.

  Edit:

  Presumably people would put a lot of effort into min-maxing their builds. But they wouldn't have the same options as players so, right? In-universe, people can't choose to be born a certain race or into a Sorcerer bloodline? Does that extend to needing e.g. years of training to become a Wizard, or genuine faith to become a Cleric?

  Immediately after posting this, YouTube recommended me [a video on odd 5e rules](https://youtu.be/JC-t1yoPCIQ). Fights between dragons consist mainly of them tripping each other! See Invisibility doesn't help you hit or defend against invisible creatures!
