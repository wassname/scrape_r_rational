  As someone who wasn't hugely engaged by the manga, I thought the first episode of the anime was excellent. The more visceral medium works really well for it.

  This probably isn't going to blow anyone's mind from a rational fiction perspective, but it's worth watching in its own right.

  Haven't read this story since the first and third chapter. Does it get better?

    If you didn't enjoy the opening of the manga, you probably won't enjoy the rest of it.

    There's a few interesting plans and twists as you go along, but in some parts it starts to show its age and get sloppy to the point of disrupting my suspension of disbelief. Ultimately it's a shounen manga and eventually it does fall into some of the trappings of the genre.

    I still enjoy it though since I'm invested in seeing where things go.

    edit: I expect the first season of the anime to cover the parts before it somewhat started to derail (IMO). So it's worth giving a shot if you don't mind potentially being disappointed after this.

      I see what you mean. The first few chapters were really good, but I stopped reading because I wanted to catch up on other manga. I will most likely watch the anime. Thank you for your input.

  The manga seems to have been initially discussed in this subreddit here: https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/507fj9/the_promised_neverland_chapters_1_to_4_a_shounen/

  I love how *happy* everyone looks in the opening credits. I hope that nobody gets into this story thinking that it's going to be Cupcakes & Rainbows.

  It’s such a shame the author started rushing the chapters around ch100. I hope this isn’t eventually reflected in the anime.

    I think the anime's only gonna cover the first arc though.
