## [HSF] Incandescence, by Greg Egan. Possibly the greatest Xenofiction mystery story.

### Post:

Incandescence is an absolutely amazing story.

It follows two parallel stories. The first is about Rakesh, a human member of the Amalgam. The Amalgam is essentially the end result of a Culture-like civilization which successfully managed to amalgamate most of the species of the Milky Way. An achievement doubly impressive due to the lack of FTL.

He's been given a quest to visit the uncharted bulge of the Milky Way, the center of the galaxy, to trace evidence of a DNA-based life form which didn't originate from one of the 11 known DNA-based panspermia. Due to ennui and a sense of obligation to his unknown cousins he takes up the quest.

On the other side of the coin, we have Roy, a member of the people of The Splinter. A subterranean race in a world where the surface is death, she joins an odd old male in figuring out the mystery of why the gravity of The Splinter is such a complicated pattern, and upon cracking that, gradually learns about the very nature of the world.

The mystery of what exactly the Splinter is, is one of the best ontological mysteries I've read, and the technical information which sets up each puzzle is enough for one familiar with astrophysics to leap ahead, while not being overly technical and leaving someone who isn't an astrophysicist in the dark.
