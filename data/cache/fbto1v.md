Got it done on time this week!

As ever, let me know how I'm doing; feedback helps the story improve.  For those of you who haven't run into it yet, Pyrebound is a dark high fantasy serial, slated to last about fifteen arcs/chapters, with a vaguely Mesopotamian flavor.  The world is brutally unjust, and human society follows suit; our hero is the little guy in over his head.  The first chapter of PB starts [here](https://pyrebound.wordpress.com/2019/01/17/one-a-child-of-the-hearth/).  Thank you!
