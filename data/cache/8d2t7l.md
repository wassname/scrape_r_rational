  It's really hard to differentiate between Praesi highborn flattery and Akua having some sort of pathological attraction towards people even more ruthless than her.

    >Akua having some sort of pathological attraction towards people even more ruthless than her.

    That's the Praesi mentality, "Iron sharpens Iron". To a Praesi (or at least, the Tower's nobility), the best person you'll ever meet is your worst enemy. Malicia has the same relationship with "Dear Tasia" and "Dearest Cordelia". The line between obsessive hatred and maddened love is very thin, and the Praesi think lines are made to be crossed.

      I never thought I would see a non-Homestuck-related situation where Kismesissitude would be a useful concept to refer to, but here we are.
      ```

        Also the kiss/kill dynamic in multi-triggers in /r/parahumans. Multiple people acquiring superpowers at the same time are a multi-trigger, each gets a little piece of the other ones' main powers, and kiss/kill is an obsessive dynamic that can arise between them.

          That's more about multiple claimants to the same Name, tbh.

  Oh my god this chapter was so intense. I want all chapters to be like that from now on.

  > Never while on campaign, or attending affairs of state. The oath was to end with our reunion, whenever that may be. 

  ... He's going to die and never see her again, isn't he?

    Shit.

  EE is one of the few writers that can pull off both battles of words and battles of blades. 

  There were feints, dodges and stabs while both were sitting in a fantasy version of the hall of mirrors of Versailles.

  Loved the chapter.

  DAMNIT CAT AKUA SHOULD BE SCREAMING RIGHT NOW, NOT GIVING ADVICE!!'
  ```

  - u/Zayits:
    ```
    Yeah, Akua's likely been flattering Catherine to build up overconfidence and make her misstep at a crucial moment.
    ```

    - u/Razorhead:
      ```
      I don't think her goal is to make Catherine fail though. Don't get me wrong, if she can revive herself in some way by fucking Cat over I have no doubt she'd go for it in a heartbeat. But if that's not an option, I think she'll want to realise her goals (chaos, magnificent feats of war and horror, and Evil in general) through Cat instead.

      Also, don't forget that Praesi highborn adore overwhelming strength, cunning, and deceit. It's completely possible Akua gained a lot of respect for Cat when Cat managed to kill her.

      My opinion is that she's really giving Cat helpful advice, while slowly trying to get her to turn her into someone like her: a ruthless and violent villain. It's the only way she can influence the outside for now, so there's no reason to fuck Cat over when she will receive no benefit.

      She's like a corrupting little genie.
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        Hence the 3 wishes joke, good observation, but I think that akua is indeed screaming most of the time, 9r at least that's what I understood when cat binded her again.
        ```

- u/paradoxinclination:
  ```
  Letting Akua's unquiet ghost have any contact with the outside world in any fashion is something that can only end badly. Cat's playing with fire here.
  ```

  - u/IDKWhoitis:
    ```
    Playing around with fire is one of those traits that define Catherine Foundling.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      Cat doesn't play with fire.

      She douses herself in napalm and bear hugs her enemies.
      ```

- u/WalterTFD:
  ```
  Cat, when you note that Cordelia 'always chooses her words so carefully'...that's a trait you need to emulate.  You are literally bound by your spoken word.

  It is cute when it is an oath to Hakrem re: your drinking.  It could be much worse when you are talking to Diabolist.
  ```

- u/haiku_fornification:
  ```
  Cat, talking to the bound soul of your biggest rival is *so* last century.
  ```

- u/Ceins:
  ```
  At no point during the chapter/conversation did Cat seem like anything else than what she usually is. No Fae mentality or brutality to be seen. And I get that becoming Fae was supposed to be becoming more rigid and such. But then why does Cat make such a big deal out of drawing Winter into herself if nothing really changes.
  ```

  - u/Wolpertinger:
    ```
    It's very possible that the rigidity and unchangingness that Fae have was in part applied to the Cat we already had - it's not going to completely erase her existing personality, but it might make that ruthless, somewhat angrier person stay that way when she might have had a change of heart otherwise. She's introspective about how she's been fucking things up, but being Fae might make it harder for her to adopt a new mindset or way or doing things, so she might just keep making the same mistakes. Plus, if there was any time for her to have maximum self control and refuse to let her emotions get the best of her, it was there.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      Agree, I think I old cat would have succumbed to call Cordelia out on her sin being as bad as hers
      ```
