## [WIP][FF][RST] - The Longest Day, (HPMOR/MLP AU/Continuation) PENULTIMATE WEEKLY MEGA-UPDATE (5 Chapters)

### Post:

It was brought to my attention that near-daily updates posted as new threads entirely are not ideal. So the last five chapters I've written, I will condense into one large update, the last one before the conclusion of the story which I hope to post next week.
