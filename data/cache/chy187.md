  Sounds like she is going to distribute it equally.

  Could it be time for the drow workers to sieze the means of production?
  ```

    ```
    Or democracy in a form? Enforced by Night?
    ```

    - u/anenymouse:
      ```
      Maybe the amount of Night given up as your vote type deal?
      ```

- u/fortycakes:
  ```
  I really hope this is going where I think it's going, and Catherine is about to institute rap battles as the way to claim a sigil.
  ```

  - u/Halinn:
    ```
    *I'm about to end this drow's whole career*
    ```

- u/Don_Alverzo:
  ```
  > I could not use old means save to reach old ends.

  Did Cat really just say that [modern problems require modern solutions?](https://i.imgur.com/HePlrbJ.png)
  ```

- u/GeeJo:
  ```
  > “None who cast token in the contest may kill the nine-year-snake for a span [of] nine nights,” Rumena said. “Immortality, Deadhand. For a time.”

  > It murmured in Crepuscular, after that, citing the Tenets of Night. *For glory fades and stone crumbles, no victor forever crowned.* 

  A useful precedent for establishing that the victor of the upcoming contest for the Sigil be elected by peers, has power only for a given term, that they can't be killed by their rivals during that term.
  ```

- u/MaddoScientisto:
  ```
  >anyone brave enough linger where they could either hear or see could, unless someone chase them away.

  This sentence gave me a headache when I tried to parse it the first few times
  ```

- u/GlimmervoidG:
  ```
  The chapter starts with Cat seeing the Firstborn competing in a range of non violent ways (slam poetry, not!Go, contests of skill). We then are introduced to a problem that would normally be solved through violent competition. My guess is she's going to have the claimants do the poetry thing and have the Firstborn vote on the winner.
  ```

  - u/anenymouse:
    ```
    The poetry is probably more like either dozens or the more contemporary rap battle that is its descendant.

    >“*Cunning as cattle, fearsome as a trout*,  
    *Beloved of nerezim, quiet as a shout!”*

    We're also seeing it within the context of Cat already vetoing deaths within the "Army" it's probable that there would be an amount of deaths by now otherwise.
    ```

- u/RRTCorner:
  ```
  >thought of a thin man in ragged robes, keeping records no one would  read for a revolution that pulsed out of him like a titan’s breath. *How many of us are there, tyrant,* he’d asked, *and how many of you?*

  What / Who is this referring to?
  ```

  - u/Razorhead:
    ```
    The Hierach.
    ```

- u/hayshed:
  ```
  Time for the least bad form of government?
  ```

  - u/Ardvarkeating101:
    ```
    Rap battles!  Of course, how could we have been so blind?!?
    ```
