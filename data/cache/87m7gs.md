  I don't think this is good and there's not nearly enough of anything to tell if it *could* be good. It's also not "rational", mostly by virtue of not being anything at all; it is attempting the appearance of "rational" by using the words but does not achieve any of their meaning.

  If you're the author, what were you trying to accomplish? If you're not, why do you think this sub would like this content?

  Edit: The conclusion that "martial artist" is more important to the DB world than "scholar" is decent

  Harsh criticism incoming from seasoned veteran of internet serial fiction.

  This reads like a lazy parody. All telling, no showing, 1,500 words to a single unremarkable chapter, poor opening paragraph.

  I'm sure you mean well, but you need loads more practice before your writing will be worth reading. It's difficult to justify giving your story a read when _The Optimized Wish Project_ already does dragon ball, and incredibly well at that.

  If you want to write, and write well, you have to put in the work. You already probably have good taste and have likely read lots of great material, but that is not equitable to writing skill. Give your chapter a read and ask yourself this: if you hadn't already come up with all of these neat ideas, would this exposition really be enough to put it into the mind of a reader?

  To get where I am today, I have written something like a million words, and most of those are bitrotting on hard drives, never to be published. What I have published, some 400k words in a few different fanfics, have been met with praise from a small but not insignificant readership.

  Great popular stories have always been written by seasoned veterans of the written word. Eliezer Yudkowsky wrote HPMOR in his mid-thirties, after writing a prodigious amount of publishing-worthy blog-post philosophy and several academic papers. John C. McCrae wrote Worm after about 20 false starts.

  So my advice is: lurk more; subscribe to authorial subreddits/feeds/blogs; take a _real_ interest in analyzing the work of the great masters of the craft, understanding word-for-word what they do and how they do it; write at least 5k words per week, and keep up the habit for a year. _Then_ begin researching for your rational fanfic, and once you have a first chapter, we will shower you in upvotes.

    With respect, this is an incredibly unhelpful and, in fact, negative-value review.  Yes, you're right that the piece is too much tell-don't-show and lacks a hook at the beginning.  That's useful advice that would help /u/blak11 (or whomever the author was), so had you stopped there you would have been golden.  That said, I've seen *far* worse stories -- if nothing else, the spag here is good and it seems like it's at least making an effort to be funny.

    Telling an author "you're not good enough to write, so don't publish anything" is rude, condescending, and counterproductive.  Book learning is great and all, but "putting in the work" has to involve actually writing and getting feedback; the best way to get feedback is to publish.

    It's also not helpful to make your review all about yourself.  "I've written a million words, most of which I've never published and the stuff I've published has been praised by not-insignificant audiences" is just not-so-humble-bragging.  Personally, I have *published* over 2,000,000 words (as well as having a boatton more bit-rotting on various hard drives, as you put it), and my work has been both praised and paid for.  I would never say that in a review of someone else's story and mention it here only so that you don't try to dismiss me based on your "veteran" status.

      Yeah, I didn't quite get the point of this feedback. Even if OP has a rotten story; what is he supposed to do to get better besides writing and learning from feedback? By all means tell the author where his story went wrong and what parts were bad. But telling him not to write? How does that help him grow?

    > The Optimized Wish Project

    Where can I find that? Google seems unhelpful.

  There's too little done with this story to make it a good read, at least in my opinion. The descriptions are brief and rather uninformative; the "rationality" aspect seems to just be Gohan using the words and pinning it on his forms and the incorporation of typical rational tropes like him trying to create a utopia felt lazily introduced; may be a side effect of the low word count however.
