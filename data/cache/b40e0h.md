  Hrrrm. There's room for growth in the character, but I just don't quite buy Vivienne as a ruler. She's more the Relena Peacecraft/Euphemia Li Brittania figurehead who represents the ideals that all the power players around her center on. Maybe I'm just getting that impression because that's roughly the role she's been playing for the last year in-story, but even in this last speech at the end, she's just glomming on to Catherine's vision for the future rather than asserting her own desires, and even before she took up the regency, she mostly just served to remind Catherine of her own moral center.

  She could flex out more, e.g. start pushing for either more diplomatic resolutions to their conflicts rather than Catherine's "beat everyone into not-submission-just-unable-to-refuse-to-listen" approach, or to divert more resources to the non-military institutions in Callow, but we'll see.

    That's probably for the best, at least for now. People with independant dreams and a strong conviction to follow through on it would get Names. Right now what Catherine wants is a non-named heir to the throne, and Vivienne will have to do for now. I'm sure she will grow into it after she assumes the position.

    Also we now have confirmation of why exactly Malicia wouldn't cooperate with the Liesse Accords. Of course she wouldn't want to abdicate.
    ```

    - u/Frommerman:
      ```
      The real question is whether Praes can exist at all under this system. Dread Emperor is a Name you get by becoming the Emperor of Praes, and nothing more seems to be needed. The story of the villain overlord is so strong in the Wasteland that their overlord will always be Named. Chancellor is also a Name, so that eliminates both of the traditional positions of supreme power in the Empire.

      Not only will Cat have to kill or cow Malicia to get these Accords, she will also have to so thouroughly destroy the culture of the Wasteland that it's possible for its leader to not immediately become Named.
      ```

      - u/cyberdsaiyan:
        ```
        That's certainly an interesting way to think about it. I was thinking that Cat would finish what Black started and wipe the high lords and maybe install some non-named but above-average mage, because normal people wouldn't last a day in Praesi courts.

        Or, well after abdication of the throne of Callow, she could become the last dread empress, rule for a decade or two (which is around how long black took to change Callow's culture into what it is now) and then either pull a traitorous or die by the hands of a hero, hopefully after changing the face of the entire continent.
        ```

      - u/thebishop8:
        ```
        It's worth noting that in chapter 16, Cat figures that Praes would never consider signing the accords.
        ```

- u/Allian42:
  ```
  So the Liesse Accords forbids Named as rulers, which is interesting but I don't see how that could work. Unless Cat pulls the biggest miracle of them all, I doubt the Accords with solve war. If that's the case, rulers that are not Named will have a lot of trouble staying alive against Names like Assassin and fighting usurpation from Named like Empress or Tyrant. Imagine a kingdom with Viv at the head and then say the Hierarch decides to go against her. It would be over in minutes.

  Also, I hope the Accords are more encompassing than just barring Names. Cat lost her quite a long time ago and yet could go toe to toe against most heroes.
  ```

  - u/GlimmervoidG:
    ```
    Several nations already survive find with non-Named rulers. Procer has never had a named leader, as far as we know, and Callow only had one half the time per WoG. Despite that Procer a major power and Callow stood against the Dread Empire.
    ```

    - u/Allian42:
      ```
      Yes but both of those are, or were, good aligned. And even then, remember the last interlude with the grey pilgrim? If a hero finds a ruler unsuitable, he may go for the "greater good" approach.
      ```

  - u/boomfarmer:
    ```
    Rulers that are not Named may still be intimately guarded by Named.
    ```

    - u/Allian42:
      ```
      They may. But what's to stop a villain guard from trowing a coup? The ruler is not strong enough to resist.
      ```

- u/CarsonCity314:
  ```
  I feel like the restriction against Named rulers is a major flaw in the Liesse Accords - it's picking a fight against the weight of every story that relates to rulership.  Just as it wasn't easy for Praes to abolish the Chancellor name, it should be far more difficult to abolish all the rulership names.
  ```

  - u/BaggyOz:
    ```
    I don't disagree but it seems to me that while it is almost impossible to achieve it's also vital to achieve the aim of the aim of the accords. Nations follow leaders and Named leaders will lead their nations along the grooves in creation that Cat is trying to undo.
    ```

  Vivienne is such a wet paper towel of a character. Even when she had a name she was forgettable and now she is barely a tertiary character despite being in the Woe. Her entire character arc could be replaced with Abigail's at this point. With very few ripples in the plot. 

  She's been boring to read about since she was in William's gang.
  ```

  - u/Empiricist_or_not:
    ```
    Isn't that what you want in a head of state; Boring practical competance?
    ```

    - u/Rorschach_And_Prozac:
      ```
      Sure, but I'm not voting for a head of state, I'm reading a web serial. And boring makes for a bad fantasy character. 

      There are plenty of other characters in the story without Names that bring much more to the story. And have much more presence when given screen time. Like Robber or even Hune. Abigail now, too, is much more interesting to read.

      Reading about Vivienne, I can't even remember why she's part the team or why she's still here or what her character arc is. 

      I felt that way about Abigail at first, because she kept bizarrely getting screen time, but she developed into an interested character to read about. Vivienne has developed into a LESS interesting character. Less than even killian, who had at least some depth but was still written out of the story completely. 

      I trust the author, and I'm I'm no danger of dropping the story, because he's more than proven he's capable of weaving compelling stories and characters. But every time Vivienne is on screen I'm just confused about why. She had no depth of character even when she had cool powers. Now she doesn't even have cool powers. Slogging through Vivienne centered story parts seems like a chore when everything else is an absolute delight.

    >Vivienne is such **a wet paper towel** of a character.

    Kind of off-topic, but is this actually an idiom? I've heard people use the phrase "wet blanket" for someone who dampens the fun of those around them, but I couldn't find anything to explain the phrase "wet paper towel." In context it seems you're using it to mean she's boring, though if it was an idiom I'd imagine it means something more like "a tool that's already served its purpose and should be thrown away." 

    ... I think I'm really overthinking this.

    Incidentally, I think Vivienne is my least favorite of the Woe but I think she is still an important part of it. She served the role of Cat's moral compass while she was Wintery; she served important functions in running the kingdom both before Cat was away and during; and she provides us another avenue of insight to Callowan culture, Name lore, and politics. I do think that you nailed one thing though: 

    > With very few ripples in the plot. 

    Viv doesn't affect the plot much - and I think that's been by design. The entire conversation in this chapter was basically talking about why that was; she had a Name that wasn't equipped to make lasting changes to her country, and even though Names have narrative weight, a Thief's role is much more about not being noticed or center stage. Now that she's no longer bound to that role I expect she will become more instrumental in the plot; though if she doesn't get another Name, she'll likely still be less important overall than the rest of the Woe.
    ```

    - u/Rorschach_And_Prozac:
      ```
      Like a wet blanket, but with much less utility. 

      Anyway, about the ripples in the plot thing. I didn't mean Vivienne made no ripples in the plot. I meant that everything Vivienne is doing for the story could be entirely replaced by Abigail and that would make no very few ripples. Vivienne is a boring character to read about, and what's much worse, she isn't UNIQUE in any way. She brings nothing to the story that someone else, or multiple people, are not already bringing, while all being more interesting to read about.
