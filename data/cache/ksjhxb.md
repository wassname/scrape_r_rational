## Hermione Granger and the Silent Country, ch. 5: Seeking Knowledge (part of a Gryffindor!Voldemort AU)

### Post:

The latest chapter, "Seeking Knowledge," can be found [here](https://archiveofourown.org/works/27111157/chapters/69917787). 

TINTF explores a Tom Riddle who, having been sorted into Gryffindor, remains a Dark wizard but (generally) doesn't view his underlings as expendable cannon fodder and, though he would prefer to live forever, is not so afraid of death that he will make rash and ill-advised decisions like splitting his soul almost as soon as he's heard the word "horcrux."

  No questions answered, many more raised.

  Unanswered questions:

  * What is studied in Dark Arts?

  * What does punishment at Hogwarts entail?

  * What is happening to the vanished muggle children?

  * Why was Hermione invited to the tournament?

  Probably some others.

  New questions:

  * What are the Death Eaters actually up to now, besides enforcing the revolution?

  * What value does a different admittedly terrible potions master have to Riddle?

  * How does the Basilisk play chess? (My guess is it really is the Basilisk playing, with Riddle just translating and acting as a go-between)

    > What value does a different admittedly terrible potions master have to Riddle?

    Might be that it's less about the Potions professor position and more about giving Lucius a role where he's appropriately contained/rewarded. IIRC, McGonagall says his actions were what let the Death Eaters win.

      I'm going to take the criticism from Lucius's teenage son (and obvs bias best friend) with a grain of salt. Overbearing and unusually driven whilst trying and failing to create the same drive in his students is still more effort than too many teachers I've had.

      I mean he helps the students who are struggling, he caters his approach to each student's abilities, he even (if misguidely in approach) tries to involve the parents in their kids education. That's not terrible, especially when the canon potions master is literally Neville's Boggart fear because he is so vile.

      Saying he is frightfully mismatched with the younger levels and those not interested at all in potions would be reasonable though.

  It's interesting to see all of the different friendships from canon.  Malfoy being friends with Tonks isn't something I would have called, even without the hostility between Andromeda and the rest of the Black family for being a "blood traitor."  Neville, either.

  Speaking of Neville, it's nice to see him thriving in Potions class when he isn't bullied into terror.

  > treat the books kindly (“like flat, faithful, and unfortunately-flammable friends,” according to one flyer)

  I need that as a poster for my wall.

  >a voice so quiet it was almost a kind of word-shaped hollowness in the air

  Very nice turn of phrase.

  >**Rules of the Hogwarts Library**

  All very sensible, although it's missing any description of punishment for violations (although the penalty for breaking the "damage" rule should, of course, be "slow and painful death")

  > Ten books was a normal, reasonable amount to borrow, wasn’t it?

  Absolutely, Hermione!

  > *Unity is Strength*

  ...Reminds me of Lewis Prothero:

  > Strength through Unity  
  > Unity through Faith  
  > Good guys win, bad guys lose  
  > And, as always, England prevails.

  Although perhaps "Magic" should replace "Faith."

  I can totally see Lucius Malfoy as a complete by-the-book, well-organized, perfectionist potions master, contrasted with Snape's snide, "throw you into the water to see if you can swim" style.

  > I’m never going to stay in those caves forever, but I’m always going to go back.

  An interesting metaphor.

  >neither Hermione nor Bathilda Bagshot could quite figure out the logistics that made this possible. The bloody thing didn’t even have hands. How was it supposed to write letters? 

  Quick Quotes Quill, with an additional charm to translate from Parseltongue to English?  It doesn't seem as complicated as they're making it.

  >We just watch the portraits talk to each other.

  That mostly sounds awkward, treating private conversation as a spectator sport.

  > F, U, Þ, A, R, and K are the first six runes of Futhark

  Huh.  TIL.   I've heard of Futhark before, but didn't know why it was called that.

    Do people know it can speak? As opposed to listening to commands

    Also if it was that easy to translate languages especially parseltongue you'd expect some use somewhere

    Still it also doesn't seem insanely complicated to figure out a number of solutions

      Right.  Another option could be a chessboard with a protean charm (like the Dumbledore's Army galleons) to transmit the moves.  I don't think that's bidirectional, but that would just mean you'd need two of them.

      Or use a mirror like the one Sirius gave to Harry; just make sure the one on the Basilisk side is pointed right at the board to prevent petrification.

      Wizarding Britain is not lacking ways to communicate things.

        The basilisk is (reportedly) playing correspondence chess: Riddle comes out of the Chamber of Secrets with a letter (in his own handwriting), which he claims to have been dictated by the basilisk. He owls this to whoever is (supposed to be) playing the basilisk, then eventually receives a letter back and (says that he) delivers it to the basilisk. 

        Some people think this is ludicrous and that Riddle is just fucking with everyone, because the idea of Riddle sitting idly by and taking dictation for a giant chess-playing snake with killer eyeballs is just bonkers. 

        I definitely have to rewrite this passage to make some aspects of it clearer, lol.
        ```

        - u/Frommerman:
          ```
          I think the people who think this is bonkers are stupid. There are *plenty* of excellent reasons to cultivate a good relationship with an 800 year old murder snake with at least human intelligence and death laser eyes, particularly when you're the only one who can talk to her.
          ```

  I'm right now binge-reading the whole thing, I just finished the mask coming off.

  Amazing fic, so good in so many ways. The magic is analysed and consistent, same for the people, same for the world-building.

  Really a great find!
  ```

- u/None:
  ```
  I wonder how notable it is that "Volume XLIX of *The Collected Correspondence and Commentaries of Nicolas Flamel*" was checked out for the summer, considering the plot of the first Harry Potter book. Is Riddle still trying to track down the stone?

  Also, maybe the basilisk is using the giant chessboard to play. I know canonically it was made by McGonagall, but I wouldn't put it past a bit of canon convergence resulting in Riddle making one for it and also making it respond to Parseltongue. Alternatively if it's really good at chess (or at visualization) it could be memorizing the positions, or using its own time control and responding quickly when Riddle comes to visit to make it a fair fight with children. The world is magical, and it's an intensely magical creature, the question of how the basilisk can be playing without hands is maybe the most perplexing thing they could ask.
  ```

  - u/Nimelennar:
    ```
    I don't think it's the "chess" part of "correspondence chess" that they're perplexed by; it's the "correspondence" bit.
    ```

    - u/callmesalticidae:
      ```
      Yeah, that. 

      The fact that so many people are getting caught on the "chess" part, though, suggests that I *really* need to rewrite that passage, though.
      ```
