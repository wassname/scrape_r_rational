  Hey everyone, welcome back! Brief comment about the last chapter's battle: it bent a couple rules from the pokemon game in ways that feel justified, to me. The first was the whirlwind attack being able to clear field hazards the way defog does, since both are essentially the same type of attack, but divided by function. I'm not sure it makes sense for some flying pokemon to be able to create a whirlwind that can blow pokemon away, but not blow objects or fog away, so I'm ignoring the fact that the pidgey line doesn't naturally learn defog outside of egg moves.

  The second is ingrain, which normally stops a pokemon from being blown or scared away from battle, but also stops you from being able to withdraw it, which is just… strange. It's not like it stops you from catching a pokemon in the wild, and there's nothing about the move that to me indicates that it should make a pokemon immune to a pokeball's effects. It seems to just be a balance decision they made, logic bedamned, and so I'm okay with putting the logic back in at the cost of game fidelity.

  Enjoy the chapter, and hope everyone is staying safe this holiday. It would be a shame to get COVID just before vaccines start to roll out!

    Personally I think you should take even more liberties with the game rules, the way you have done the battles already match the feeling of the game Battle so well in spirit, don't let the details break it.
    ```

  - u/anenymouse:
    ```
    Also technically speaking you can and have always been able to catch a wild pokemon than has used ingrain you just generally can't withdraw one as as trainer minus exact situations that do. There's arguably a hole in the logic to begin with.

  Ugh Red, I swear to Arceus its two steps forward one step back with you - if you have read as many stories as you claim you would know keeping the *sakki* secret in particular from Leaf, probably also Blue, is totally going to blow up in your face! You had all those therapy sessions around how telling the people in your life your feelings instead of assuming and bottling them up is better, gotta realize those are general case lessons, not Akio-death-specific techniques. And Leaf was there for it all, it affected her - she may take the deception personally.

  The poor boy has had way too much trauma in too little a span of time...
  ```

  - u/burnerpower:
    ```
    This is a dangerous secret. Information security dictates he shouldn't have told Maria, even if doing so was very beneficial to her emotional well being. Ideally he would tell no one. He lives in a world with people who can read minds after all.

    It almost certainly would be fine to tell Blue/Leaf, but the main argument for it would be so they can offer emotional support. Considering the stuff Leaf gets up too I doubt she'd take the deception personally even though she'd be concerned about the implications for pokemon if this sakki trick became widespread. I'd have to reread. I remember Leaf and Red having an argument about sakki but can't remember the exact contention.
    ```

    - u/Memes_Of_Production:
      ```
      Yeah, and publishing it would not in fact be wise - but telling your friends is not that for sure. I also think there has to be some recognition that you are in fact a 12 year old boy, and it is extremely likely that you are not the first person to be able to pull this technique off, or something close. There is very high probability that the military or Giovanni or what have you have done at least similar techniques, at least from Red's perspective - like with the Doctor conversation about partitions, where Red believed he had some unique experience but of course a trained specialized knew about other fringe tulpa cases. I would talk to Sabrina about it as well if I were him, as she could put it in proper context.

      Of course I get why he isn't - this is not a well-reasoned stance of logic, but an emotional decision based on fear of judgement and guilt over the actions. The poor smol boy!
      ```

    - u/shankarsivarajan:

      >would be fine to tell Blue/Leaf

      Blue is dark, so yeah, he can keep a secret. Leaf isn't, so she can't.

  Glad to get a Red perspective chapter after so long! Spooky ghosts and conspiracies abound. The gang gets back together for a journey for the first time in many chapters.

  I look forward to seeing them all interact together again. It'll probably never be the same as the early days but its exciting to see them move on to bigger things. 

  Red seems emotionally more stable too despite his most recent trauma. I do wonder if forgetting traumatic past events in his life could have negative consequences. As long as part of him remembers though it seems safe enough.
  ```

  - u/Memes_Of_Production:
    ```
    It does seem like that is partly because he is rarely fully "dealing" with it, though - when his partition is up he can't recall the events of the Casino, and when his partition is down but he is visiting Leaf, he has Amnesia'd himself and only his partition seems to remember. The one time he is fully aware, in his room before Jason appears, he is quite morose. He is certainly better than post-Akio but I think he is doing a lot of mental shenaniganry to blunt the emotional impact of his decisions.
    ```

- u/Hidden-50:
  ```
  This makes me wonder if psychics could learn to teleport without a pokemon? You'll usually have a pokemon to use, but it would probably speed things up if you need to make a quick escape.

  > Something tickles in his brain, a sensation he's not entirely sure is physical rather than mental (if there's even a difference), and he almost, for a moment, understands what it is abra do when they teleport, almost understands in some wordless way how teleportation doesn't interact with the physical world at all, but rather the one in which minds leave an impression that can be read and communicated with…

  Then again, pokemon might also be stronger and human psychics could lack the raw psychic power needed. Maybe they could manage short-distance teleport?
  ```

  - u/Luminous_Lead:
    ```
    Human finesse + Pokemon strength is probably why Mewtwo was made.
    ```

  - u/Grasmel:
    ```
    I wonder if teleport power requirements depends on distance, and to what extent. If it's a big factor, then Aba should either get winded going across the region or use almost no effort to go around the block. Or maybe it's a big chunk of activation cost, plus a smaller scaling cost for distance?

    The obvious problem with this is leaving allies behind, of course, unless you can take them along as you teleport.
    ```

- u/CarVac:
  ```
  I find it interesting that in this world, truth is mostly verifiable, via psychic probing. For now.

  But in the real world, everyone is equivalent to Dark…

  What cultural differences might there be as a result that haven't been elaborated on?
  ```

  - u/strategicallusionary:
    ```
    Asking the big questions here! It's a step out of Eden, to suddenly loose a complicit layer of trust, even if it's only verifiable by some hypothetical other/stranger/hiree/position of authority. The known existence of Truth as Specific and Recognizable would lead to a very specific and implicit cordiality and baseline respect.   


    A world where such quantities are truly unknown, and especially one thrust so suddenly into such chaos... it's easy to conjure images of assassin wars, yakuza, organized crime, and fascism. Fear and distrust as a driving societal factor, and the extremes people might go to to feel safe.   


    Not to mention, such a huge dip in the worldly power of Truth might tip the scales towards Ideals; suddenly, a new Unovan trio awakens...
    ```

    - u/CarVac:
      ```
      I was actually interested in the opposite.

      The only people in this world that can lie perfectly currently are dark types; in the future it'll be psychic types too. So there still is a class of people who won't be able to lie (non-dark non-psychic).

      My question is: how different is their society from ours, due to the fact that most people's statements can be verified to match their beliefs? The caveat being that it takes effort and an invasion of privacy to do said verification...

      Is this why renegade trials can be done so straightforwardly? I haven't seen any other level of implicit trust shown that wouldn't be reasonable in our real world full of doubt and lies.
      ```

      - u/shankarsivarajan:
        ```
        >why renegade trials can be done so straightforwardly

        I think the name and formality are misleading you. Thinking of them as renegade lynchings might be more reflective of the standard of evidence used.
        ```

        ```

        ```

      - u/anenymouse:
        ```
        It also seems like if it gets to a trial it's safer to call them a renegade and kill them half because of the societal statement of not even getting close, but also that someone that gets away with something like being a renegade, even if it wasn't specifically being a renegade might lead to well smarter criminals who know how they've been caught before. Which arguably is part of why Giovanni recruits them, I mean besides the huge amount of leverage he would hold in the situation.
        ```

    - u/shankarsivarajan:

      >Fear and distrust as a driving societal factor, and the extremes people might go to to feel safe.

  It feels like it's been so long since we had an old fashioned adventure with any of the cast. It's nice to see them start to get back to their lives after everything that happened these last 12 chapters, even if 'normal' to them now isn't the same 'normal' from before.

  That Celadon tag-along is totally a covert agent for Erika. Doesn't help that she is Phoenix. I'm expecting a psychic breakdown at some point.
  ```

  - u/strategicallusionary:
    ```
    Confirmed, I thought both these things!
    ```

- u/xamueljones:
  ```
  I've been kicking around a few thoughts about sakki and partitions.

  Sakki is about removing conditioning that dictates what a pokemon should or should not do which returns them to their wild state driven by instinct.

  Partitioning is about putting up barriers to block off certain patterns of thoughts or behaviors. Another way of thinking about it is that it's a type of imposed conditioning to not think about specific thoughts or mode of thoughts.

  I suspect that sakki will, later in the story, be used to counteract the ability to partition.

  ```

- u/anenymouse:
  ```
  Huh in terms of places that you encounter Team Rocket in the games it's like Mount Moon, where they're trying to get Fossils, the Nugget Bridge where they try to recruit strong trainers, there's a grunt stealing TMs in Cerulean City proper, the Games Corner where they have a base and are implicitly the owners of it, Silph Co in Sabrina's city where they attempt to steal both the Silph Scope and the Master Ball. And of course in Lavender Town where they catch a multitude of pokemon and orphan a Cubone leading us to see a the ghost of a Marowak. And i think there's one more encounter or two but the last two are the important ones to keep in mind.

  Team Rocket or rather the various forces under Giovanni have the Silph Scope or an equivalent to one, they then use that to capture a ton of ghost pokemon and probably Cubone/Marowak which our protaginists are too late to stop at least partially because of them posting ***ONLINE*** their plans to do something about Lavender Town. Which is great of coordination, but also shows their hand to the person that's arguably working against them or it could be said that our group has stumbled upon Giovanni's plans more than once.

  Also as an aside Sabrina being told that oh yeah a psychic can totally lie and not even know that they lied if they have a partition up was hilarious if only the Hoenn events had happened a little bit later, but also the extreme irony that if she had started the though experiment during the month that Red had been a part of mentorship group well let's just say Sabrina had multiple reasons to feel regret not only towards Red but seemingly toward Mewtwo also.

  Awesome chapter as always. I love learning more about the various "supernatural" ghost/psychic/dark phenomena in this world.

  The paragraph about replication struck me as odd. If it allowed for the easy, cheap & legal replication of something as complex as a Silph Scope, you'd think it would also let people replicate i.e. Ultra Balls and Full Restores, which seems like it would have huge market consequences--but instead, the only example given is pokemon statues, which is cool but hardly world-shaking. If there's some reason why battle tech can't be reproduced, it's probably worth mentioning, as otherwise the entire PokeMart business would be quickly replaced with replicators where trainers can slot in whatever they need more of and just xerox it a hundred times. You do mention a manufacturing shakeup, but to me the casual and offhanded nature of the description didn't seem to match the consequences of the new tech.
  ```

  - u/Lord_Zane:
    ```
    Perhaps the replication machines are energy intensive enough that it's only worth replacing certain things? Cheaper to cook up an industrial scale batch of full restores, rather than cloning a crate of them. That could be why it's only used for more advanced devices.

    It also might be that Poke balls specifically are like not something that can be replicated considering they aren't mentioned at all. Like that the tech is finicky and leads to say voltorbs or simply nonfunctional Poke Balls in general.

  Relative to other tweens, or in general?

  Anyway, I'm sure that once knowledge of sakki does get out, there will be conspiracy theories that the legendaries were captured years or generations ago. There probably already are, since the conditioning itself was developed within living memory. And they'll surely be the subject of an arms race if they can be used aggressively.

  ETA: Aggressively by any old psychic, I should say, since hunters can already to that. Maybe Red just ought to work harder at getting one first.

  >Uhm.... that feels inconsistent:The wariness deepens. Talking or thinking about this part in particular always makes the discomfort worse. “I didn’t. Keep my concentration, I mean.

  >“And then you focused on it?”

  >“With the help of my partitioned self, yeah. I realized the next time it attacked a survivor that it was able to see humans as threats. After that it was just a matter of warning my friends.”

  This reads like he killed Rakim first and then Maddie.

  Red killed Maddie with her Sandslash to save Lizzy.So he already broke that taboo, at that point.Then **afterwards** he killed Rakim with Maria's Vulpix to save her and Glen.

  Seems more odd that Red wouldn't have used Rakim's Golem or his Magmar, because it felt wrong, when he just did the same thing with Maddie's Sandslash.Especially since it was Rakim's Golem from the beginning, that tipped him off.Or at least that's what he's telling Sabrina.

  That story has another problem though, because Rakim's Golem only told him that there was one renegade about.Not that Roark specifically was one. Roark is dark and probably was using a pokémon to just shovel them free (and then getting a separate kill command, which Red could not have known for sure). So my theory is that Red succeeded in becoming the perfect liar.

  And he's hiding the fact that he went full "sleep time first, ask questions later" at that point, which is worthy of a renegade branding.

  Actually no, I'm none too confident that I can properly keep track of Red's web of lies and deception.

  Part of the problem is that I'm never sure what "partition is up" vs "partition is down" means.Does up mean "up like a raised gate" or "up like a raised wall"?Like..... is a partition more like a fence (coming in from below) or more like a garage door (coming in from above)?I only know "partition of a set" from mathematics. Or on a hard drive.This isn't as obvious as raising and lowering psychic shields.I have raised shields in real life before, after all.

  Could you maybe clear that up? Or perhaps cut down on the ambiguity :)
  ```

  - u/masasin:
    ```

    Wait, why do you think Maddie was killed first?
    ```

    - u/DavidGretzschel:
      ```
      I suppose it was never spelled out directly.But I read those chapters over quite a bit, trying to make sense of what happened when to whom. And why things happened at all (i.e. why was Lizzy attacked?). It was very confusing, because chapter 86 introduced a third renegade (with a similar name to Rakim, which I originally mixed him up with) in the retelling and then hipster Leaf was being ambiguous about the gender of Maddie.\[before you fixed that\]Perhaps I finally had a timeline in my head and then fell prey to confirmation bias.But rereading it all, everything seems to point to that.

      Chapter 83 Interlude XV - Titans III

      So Maria gets directions from Fake-Lizzy, but then the directions change.

      >She stops in confusion as the mental sense starts directing her somewhere again, still full of fear and a sense of urgency… but the direction she feels her attention being tugged in is different from before. “The direction changed?”

      That would make sense if Lizzy was already safe.Though maybe he just reprioritized on the fly since we get this soon after:

      >“I don’t know.” MG leans against the wall, feeling overwhelmed by the despair and fear and insistent need to get down to where the next murder is going to happen… *murder?*  
      >  
      >She focuses on the feeling again, eyes closed, and feels the psychic impressions mixing with her own… *emergency-danger-pokemon-hurry-victim- searching-KILLINGINTENT…* MG’s eyes snap open as she sucks in a shocked breath at the surge of violent focus she felt, for just a moment. She thought a pokemon had gotten in, somehow, but no, this is something more deliberate…

      But this part happened before Rakim was killed.And KILLINGINTENT was capitalized, kind of like D-E-T-E-R-M-I-N-A-T-I-O-N. So I figured that's Red doing his Sakki-thing on a Pokemon. Since Sakki has been referred to specifically as "killing intent".

      Also the hospital:

      >“You still acted quickly in capturing his pokemon after,” Lizzy says. “That was really brave! I was so shocked by what happened I didn’t even think of it, just ran away. I got doubly lucky my renegade’s sandslash didn’t chase after me, or kill someone else while I was busy with the generator, and just stood around her body until Leaf was able to put it to sleep.”

      So she was only busy with the generator after Maddie was dead, presumably very cautiously tiptoing around a very confused Sandslash that just killed all her Pokémon and its own trainer. \[you mentioned in one of the latter comment-threads that her Arcanine didn't stand a chance, because of type advantage and I think she'd throw everything she had at it, to save her own life\]  
      And it must have taken her a while, since she was worried that the Sandslash might have gone on another rampage, whilst she did generator repairs aided only by emergency lights. \[her Pokémon being dead\]

      Admittedly the hospital timeline might be part of some convoluted alibi-scheme, but I just took it at face-value.

      \----

      >And…  
      >  
      >The renegade is screaming, horrible high pitched sounds of pain as light bursts from around the corner.

      Between Rakim cuddling with the Vulpix and the light coming back on, there's maybe a minute that's passed.

      If Rakim died before Maddie, the following would had to have happened in just one minute:  
      Maddie chases Lizzy with a Sandslash. Presumably away from the generator, not towards it, since that's why she was likely targeted in the first place.  
      Lizzy summons all of her Pokémon to defend herself, till they're either all dead or crippled. Because why wouldn't she? It's been established before that a competent trainer would always sacrifice their Pokémon to save your own life or buy themself time, if need be.  
      Then Maddie's Sandslash turns on her.  
      Then Lizzy carefully tiptoes back around the bloodspattered Sandslash to the generator.   
      Then she fixes it without any Pokémon using only her electrical engineering skills with emergency light only.

      That doesn't really seem likely.  
      Red confirms in this chapter, that he had to use Maddie's Sandslash, because he had no other option.  
      Even though he just used the Vulpix hug technique, he couldn't do it with Lizzy's much faster Arcanine (the mate of Soul? Oh God..... Lizzy lost her soulmate!)  
      Even though he has experience with Pikachu's senses, he couldn't do it with a similar enough Flaaffy.  
      Those are good options, that he presumably would have tried.  
      Maybe he couldn't use them, because he was busy controlling the Vulpix at the moment, but there's no reason to assume that it had this highly specific timing.

      \---  
      Now Lizzy was in Subbasement 1, which has a "turn around the lost tourists"-order, not a "kill all intruders"-order, like subbasement 3.   
      And even Rakim considered not acting on the explicit kill-order, since this was obviously not the situation it was intended for.  
      And Giovanni doesn't hire giggly unstable psychopaths for guard duty.  
      \[at least Rakim wasn't and it doesn't seem like the proper fit for the job\]

      But Maddie trying to kill the girl that loudly announces that it's looking for the generator makes perfect sense.  
      Though unless she's going for the psychopathic employee award of the year, this must have been a direct order from Archer, since she's thereby actively hindering the rescue of her colleagues, fantasy Indigo league competitors and presumably friends.

      What doesn't make sense is to kill the girl that just fixed the generators.   
      Much simpler to sneak around her and destroy the generators for good.   
      Lizzy presumably would have been on her way to join up with Glenn and the others.

  I don't mean to offend you with this question, but have you considered basing your side characters for this story on the side characters from the anime? At least name and design wise. It would help us readers to be able to visualize the events in the story and probably help them become at least a little more memorable.

    No offense taken, but uh, I don't watch the anime >.>

      Neither do I, but it's nice having an image to go on sometimes.

    Not that I've seen the anime past season 1, but including some cameos of pokemon characters would be nice for those that have. Although, implying that the characters in the story aren't already memorable is crazy. You're crazy. How can you forget, the twins, or the savvy foreigner, or even the mysterious foreigner!
    ```

    - u/DaystarEld:
      ```
      There are in general probably just too many characters that show up too briefly for me to make them all memorable, but I can't use that excuse entirely, especially when I basically never do physical descriptions :P
