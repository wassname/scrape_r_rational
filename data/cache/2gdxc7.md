  I just want to know how the fuck Wildbow manages to keep up the volume of writing. I mean seriously, 10k word updates two or three times a week?

    Practice. Wildbow has conditioned himself for speed over the years. When Worm started, the chapters weren't quite so long as they are now, but he's ramped up as he's gone along. (There was a week when Worm updated every single day, which I think shows that he can go much faster if he really needed to.)

      Well, it's really damn impressive.

        Don't forget he's paid by donation. How impressed are you now?
        ```

          Even more so?

  Sweet! A [little tweak](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18xcEYRK0Ts-k6--ZOuDFh-ILK9hLzcgkDTIf6L_G90s/export?format=pdf) to your link though, should download as PDF now (takes a while)
