  Maybe a variation of privledging the hypothesis - once you have seen one instance of a unicorn most of the work into what animal you could see has already been done.

  I do see your point. I'm not aware of whether there's a specific name for it. Going from zero to one often involves the concept of whether a thing is actually even possible at all, such as when a new device is invented, or a new technique is tested for the first time and works.

  Going from one to many doesn't have that same fundamental attachment to sheer existence; if one of something is already around, it exists, and making more doesn't change its ability to exist. (Although it does involve checking off the "reproducibility" box.)

  I suspect the math behind this is simple multiplication/division. `1` in infinitely many times larger than `0`, but `many` is only `many` times larger than `1`.
