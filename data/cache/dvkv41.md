I dub this Holm's Maxim.

I think /r/rational isn't doing terribly on Holm's Maxim, but it's not perfect, and I would like to see us do better.  I enjoy seeing recommendations of *positive* aspects of rationality-flavored stories that someone liked.  I would like to see fewer people responding with lists of what ought to be disliked about that work instead.

I propose to adopt this as the explicit rough policy of /r/rational.  This initial post should be considered as opening the matter for discussion.

If you think all of this is so obvious as to barely require stating, then please at least upvote this post before you go, rather than enforcing a *de facto* rule that only people who dislike things (such as stories, or policy proposals) ought to interact with them.

This post was written to summarize a longer potential piece whose chapters may or may not ever get completed and posted separately.  Perhaps it will be enough to say these things at this short(er) length.

##### Slap not the happy.

* The world already contains a sufficient quantity of sadness.  If an artistic experience is making somebody happy, you should not be trying to interfere with their happiness under a supermajority of ordinary circumstances.

##### Art runs on positive vitamins.

* "All literature consists of whatever the writer thinks is cool... I happen not to think that full-plate armor and great big honking greatswords are cool. I don't like 'em. I like cloaks and rapiers. So I write stories with a lot of cloaks and rapiers in 'em, 'cause that's cool...  The novel should be understood as a structure built to accommodate the greatest possible amount of cool stuff."  This is Steven Brust's *Cool Stuff Theory of Literature*.
* The Lord of the Rings would not have benefited from a hard-fantasy magical system, or from more intelligent villains.  That is not a kind of cool stuff that would fit with the other cool stuff that Lord of the Rings did very well.  *Not every story needs to contain every kind of cool stuff.*
* Positive selection is when you can win by doing one thing very well.  Negative selection is when you have to pass a lot of filters where you do nothing wrong.  Negative selection is sadly becoming more prevalent in society; to be admitted to Harvard you have to jump through *all* the hoops and not just do extremely well at one particular thing.  It's okay to positively select stories with a high amount of some cool 'rational' stuff you enjoy, rather than demanding that every element avoid any trace of sin according to laws of what you think is 'irrational'.  *Literary community is more fun when it runs on positive selection.*

##### 'Rational X' is an idea for a new story, not a criticism of an old story.

* The economy in xianxia worlds makes no sense, you say?  Perhaps xianxia readers are not reading xianxia in order to get a vitamin of good economics.  But if you think good economics is cool stuff, you now have a potential story element in a *new* story that will appeal to people who like good economics - what would a sensible xianxia economy look like?
   * This is really a corollary of Cool Stuff Theory, but important enough to deserve its own headline because of how it focuses on building-up over tearing-down.  "It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better."  Criticism can drive out creation, especially if criticism is an easy and risk-free way to get attention-reward.

##### Criticism easily goes wrong.

* Among the several Issues with going around declaring that some other piece of work contains a flaw and is therefore "irrational" - besides missing the entire concept of the Cool Stuff Theory of Literature - is that often such people fail to question their own criticism.  I have seen a *lot* of purported "flaws", in my own work and in others', that were simply missing the point.  To shake a finger and say, "Ah, but you see..." does not always make you look smart.  *Flaws have flaws.*
* Consider some aspect of a story that *might* contain some mistake.  Let its true level of mistakenness be denoted M.  Now suppose a set of Reddit commenters read the story, and each commenter assesses their estimate of the story's mistakenness R\_i = M + E\_i where E\_i is the i-th commenter's error.  Suppose that the i-th commenter has a threshold of mistakenness T\_i where they will post a negative comment as soon as R\_i > T\_i.  Then if you read a Reddit thread that thinks it's supposed to be about calling out flaws, the commenters you see may be selected for (a) having unusually low thresholds T\_i before they speak and/or (b) having high upward errors E\_i in their estimates of the target's mistakenness.  (This is not a knockdown criticism of all critics; if the story actually does contain a big flaw, you may hear from sane people with good estimates too.  Though even then, the sane people may not be screaming the loudest or getting retweeted the most.)  It's one thing to *ask* of a *single person* if they thought anything was wrong with some story.  You get a very different experience if you *listen* to 100 people *deciding* whether a story is sufficiently flawed to deserve a raised voice.  It's so awful, in fact, that you probably don't want to hang out on any Reddits that think their purpose is to call out flaws in things.  *Broadcast criticism is adversely selected for critic errors.*
* "What do you think you know, and how do you think you know it?" is a question that sometimes people just plain forget to ask.  Outside of extremely easy cases, in general we do not have solid information about what goes on inside of other people's heads - unless they have explicitly told us *and* we believe in both their honesty and their introspective power.  It seems to me that part of our increasing civilizational madness involves people just making up awful things that other people could have thought... and simply treating those bad-thought-events as facts to be described with the rest of reported history.  Telepathic critics don't distinguish their observations from their inferences at all, let alone weigh alternative possibilities.  Not as a matter of rationalfic, but as a matter of this being a literary subreddit at all, please don't tell me what bad things the author was thinking unless the author plainly came out and said so.  *You're not an author telepath.*

##### Negativity deals SAN damage.

* When tempted to go on angry rants in public about fiction you don't like, it would not do to overlook the larger context that your entire civilization is going mad with anger and despair, and you might have been infected.  There may be some things worth being publicly negative about.  But in the larger context we are dealing with an insane, debilitating, addictive, mental-health-destroying, civilization-wrecking cascade of negativity.  This negativity is even *less* appropriate for preventing people from having fun reading books, than it is for fights about national-scale policies.  *It is even less justifiable to direct negativity at people enjoying fiction.*
* Even if you are genuinely able to gain purely positive happiness from angry negativity without that poisoning you, other people around you are not having as much fun.  *Negativity is even less fun for others than it is for you.*
* "But I just meant to help the author by pointing out what they did wrong!"  If you try delivering your critique to the author in private, they may find it much more credible that you meant only to help them, and weren't trying to gain status by pushing them down in public.  There's a reason why YCombinator operates through private sessions with founders instead of having a public forum where they say everything their founders are doing wrong.  There may sometimes be a positive purpose for public criticism, but almost always that purpose is *not* purely trying to help the targets.  *Credibly helpful unsolicited criticism should be delivered in private.*
* You are probably violating Holm's Maxim if you suddenly decide to do "rationalfic worldbuilding" in a thread where somebody else just said they enjoyed something.  "I loved the poetry in Lord of the Rings!"  "But Gandalf is such an idiot, why didn't he just fly the Ring to Mordor on the Eagles?  And the whole system is never clear on exactly what the Valar and Maiar power levels are."  No, this is *not* you brainstorming ideas for your own stories that will have different enjoyable vitamins.  That motive is not credible given the time/place/occasion, nor the tone.  *Don't let somebody else's enjoyment be your trigger for public deconstruction.*
* It's fun to enjoy something in public without feeling ashamed of yourself.  If you're part of Generation Z, you may have never known this feeling, but trust me, it's fun!  But most people's enjoyment is fragile enough that anyone present effectively has a veto - a punishment button that not only smashes the smile, but conditions that person not to smile again where anyone can see them.  In this sense we are all in a multi-party prisoner's dilemma, a public commons that anyone can burn.  But even if somebody defects and tries to kill a smile, the situation may not be beyond repair; a harsh reply will have less smile-prevention power if the original comment is upvoted to 7 and the harsh reply downvoted to -3.  If we all contribute to that, maybe you'll be able to be publicly happy too!  *Public enjoyment is a public good.*
   * This is also why the situation for mistaken negativity is asymmetrical with a positive recommendations thread generating early positives from people who enjoyed things the most and have the lowest thresholds for satisfaction.  In that case, ideally, you read the first chapter of a story you turn out not to like, and then stop.  If it was a really bad recommendation, maybe you go back and downvote the recommending comment as a warning to others - without posting a reply showing off how much better you know.  Contrastingly, when public criticism runs amok, people end up living in a mental world where it's low-status and a sign of vulnerability to admit you enjoyed something.
* Maybe there *is* something wrong with a story.  Or maybe you know with reasonable surety that the author actually thought a bad thought, because you have explicitly read an unredacted full statement by the author in its original forum.  It is still true, in general, that it is possible to do even worse by feeling even more upset about it.  You should be wary of the known social dynamics that push you into doing this; they are not operating to your benefit nor to the benefit of society.  *Hypersensitivity is unhealthy.*
* If you are voluntarily having a non-gainful unpleasant experience, you should stop.  This is an important mental health skill that is also used, for example, to say "No" to people touching you in ways you do not like.   Life is too short to be spent on reading things you hate, and I say this as somebody who hopes to live forever.  The credo "Don't like, don't read" is simple and correct, and good practice for the related skills "Don't like, say no out loud" and "Don't like, explicitly think about the cost-benefit balance."  I think that people losing this basic mental skill is part of how they are going mad.  *Don't like, stop reading.*

##### Say not irrationalfic.

* I personally just get the shivers (not good shivers, metal-screeching-on-a-blackboard shivers) almost every time I hear somebody declare that something is 'irrational'.  [The word 'rational' is properly used under very restrictive circumstances to refer to properties of general cognitive algorithms](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/RcZCwxFiZzE6X7nsv/what-do-we-mean-by-rationality), not to particular acts or events.  I don't even like the name ratfic for this whole genre, and I was not the one who coined it; but the term 'irrationalfic' is much worse.  In a lot of cases it's just being used to mean, "Well, *I* thought that part of the story should've gone differently."

##### But don't show off policing of negativity, either.

One of the things that blindsided me, when I was first reaching a wider audience, was not correctly predicting in advance the way that frames attract personalities.  If I was doing the Sequences over again, I would never do anything that remotely resembled making fun of religion, because if you do that, you attract people who like to punch at socially approved targets.  If I was doing HPMOR over again, I would try to send clear(er) signals starting from page one that HPMOR was not meant as a delicious takedown of everything Rowling did wrong.

Here I am, posting about a direction I'd like to see /r/rational go, because the alternative is staying quiet and I'm not satisfied with the expected results of that.  But the direction I want to go is *not* having a ton of people enforcing their interpreted version of a strict rule that there is no hint of negativity allowed anywhere.

(Let's say that the true level of negativity in some comment is N, and each person who reads it has an error E\_i in what they think that negativity level is...)

There are conversations in which it *is* important to go back and forth about whether something was executed well under some sensible criterion of quality.  Brainstorming discussions, for example, in which somebody has solicited comment on a story yet to be written; if you are trying to optimize, you really do need to be able to criticize.  What violates Holm's Maxim is when somebody says they enjoyed something, and you respond by telling them why they were wrong to enjoy it.

So, in the event this proposal is accepted:  If a comment somewhere seems to be written in *clear* ignorance of our bias toward people saying what they enjoyed, and is trying to counter that enjoyment by saying what should have been hated - then just link them to this post, and maybe downvote the original comment.  That's all.  Don't write any scathing takedowns, don't show everyone how much better you understood the rules, don't get into a fun argument.  This Reddit isn't about policing every trace of negativity, and doing that won't make you a high-status enforcement officer.  *Just reply with a link to this post (or to an official wiki page) and be done.*

  As an overall approach to life, I very much agree with this post. However,  as it pertains to this subreddit specifically,  I will say that the positive or negative feedback about recommendations, specifically in the Monday recommendation thread, do help me make more informed decisions about what to read next. So I'd say that while slightly turning down the negativity may be a good thing, I'd hate to see one of the useful aspects of the subreddit that I appreciate be reduced because of that. Just my two cents.

    Yes. If someone views this sub as a place for authors to come and feel an inner glow then people saying sometimes unfair things about their stories is awful. 

    If you view it as a place for readers to swap impressions and find out if a story has elements that might bug them before they start reading... criticism even sometimes slightly unfair or harsh criticism that may make the author feel bad is essential. 

    It's like amazon reviews. Filtering for all the 1 star reviews can often be highly informative even if some of the reviewers are grouches
    ```

  - u/Ozryela:
    ```
    I agree. In fact I think I'll go further and say that this subreddit could do with a bit *more* (well-thought-out) criticism from time to time.

    Story recommendations benefit a lot from people posting counter-points. A recommendation "this story is great and very well written" is far less useful than a recommendation that reads "this story is great and very well written, but contains quite a few rather cliche plot twist".

    And this is true is the second part is a separate post too. If a story has 5 potential reviewers, I'd much prefer 3 positive and 2 negative reviews over just 3 positive reviews and 2 reviewers who remain silent because they don't want to be negative.
    ```

      I'll piggyback on this chain I'd like to support.

      Anecdotally, I recently made my first post to this subreddit, a suggested reading. My motivation was to provide utility and engage with the community.

      The immediate downvotes were not so frustrating, it was the total silence. As per the section *"Negativity deals SAN damage"*, this was the right way of agreeably disagreeing with my post.

      :(

      I had to address the situation before someone spoke up, from which a conversation finally formed, and in which I posted some embarrassing rants.^(it was an honest expression of my desire to attempt to communicate)

      While the silent downvotes served one purpose, metadataless integers measuring the validity of my post, the lack of tangible feedback rendered them useless to my personal growth. **Furthermore**, I propose that a comment expressing why the suggestion was unappealing provided more utility to the community than all of the downvotes.

      In conclusion, and keeping in mind that this is a niche of the internet with a focus on critical thinking, I find that criticism and negative feedback plays an important role in subreddit discussions, and should not be replaced by downvotes. The online community site Tildes' design document provides a rationale for removing downvotes [here](https://docs.tildes.net/philosophy/site-design), and generally strikes me as an ideal home for r/rational if the community ever migrates away from reddit.

      As expressed by u/Ozryela, the same argument can be made for positive feedback over upvotes. From a broader perspective, higher quality feedback in general should be prioritized, and learned perhaps through exemplary feedback promoted by the community.
      ```

      - u/Ozryela:
        ```
        Good points! Don't have much to add to this, but wanted to give some positive feedback :-)

        I do 't like downvotes very much. They are admittedly very useful in getting rid of genuinely bad content, but they are a very blunt tool. Sometimes you spend a lot of time and thought on a post, and then get downvoted just because people disagree. I sucks. 

        Not sure I have a solution. You need some protection again genuinely low-quality content, and against trolling and spam. If that were an easy problem to fix we wouldn't be living in the world we're living in.

  Ergh. I want to praise this for the direction it pumps in while still pointing out that, internally, a lot of its maxims seem to me inherently contradictory and even stifling to a community of people who celebrate writing fiction-that-tries-to-do-something-demonstrably-different-than-other-fiction-with-regards-to-writing-smarter-characters-and-consistent-worlds/magic-and-so-on. 

  Whether we call that "rational fiction" or stories that fall particularly far from that ideal "irrational fiction" is less relevant to me than that this community continues to be one that facilitates the creation of this kind of fiction by *holding each other to a standard,* loose as it may sometimes be.

  I think it's really bad for people to be uncharitable, to presume beliefs about an author, to criticize without careful thought. It would be good if people did those things less.

  But I don't know how often that happens in /r/rational compared to people just pointing out the things that they don't like about a story (stating it as such) or criticizing the aspects of a story that don't fall under /r/rational's criteria. Usually when the uncharitable or mean stuff is done I see it being downvoted. But it seems to me that you are actually pointing just as much at the discussion of a story's flaws, at *public criticism as a whole,* justified or otherwise, as you are just being mean or uncharitable.

  I recently read a fairly famous book by a fairly beloved author. I have heard nothing but good things about it beforehand, and while I've been burned by the author before, I gave it a chance. And it contained absolutely the most infuriating bit of contrived tension and "what a twist!" bullshit I've seen in years.

  And no one warned me of this. Until I ranted about the plot point on the discord, after which a few people were like "Oh that? lol yeah that was super dumb" I had no idea that anyone else might have picked up on it. 

  And despite me feeling like this is one of the few communities I can get such perspectives in, even other people from in this community who have liked the book didn't warn me about that issue. Every time I had seen the book come up it was still praised without criticism. So I think we're not yet at a point where things are being too heavily criticized.

  I don't know if I would have avoided reading the book if I'd known ahead of time, or if I'd regret that on net: the sequels get better but still contain the seeds for more of the same bullshit, so we'll see. But I do not want to live in a world where people are afraid of pointing out stuff like that because it's too close to yucking other people's yums.  I agree with not telling someone who liked a thing that they were WRONG to like a thing, but my experience so far has been that people in /r/rational do a good job of criticizing what THEY dislike about a thing without doing that. 

  So yeah. +1 to "don't be a dick," but my take is more "gatekeeping and criticism can be good when you're not a dick about it." I don't know if that's a realistic ideal to try and propagate without it just devolving into sneerclub, maybe I'm just not seeing the threads where all the negativity is happening. I'll try to keep an eye out for that more.

    >seem to me inherently contradictory and even stifling to a community of people who celebrate...

    Negative criticism and identification are different things. I've seen multiple times in the comments here that without others' criticisms, one wouldn't be able to identify the "good" from the "bad", but that's an issue of identification is it not? With objective identification comes the ability for another to interpret and apply their own valences accordingly. For every person who is "helped" by the negative criticism because their valences align with the critic's, how many others are hurt? If instead the input is neutral for the sake of identification, nobody is hurt and yet still anyone interested in finding and consuming their interests is helped.

    >

    And yet, there are probably other people that liked that thing! Maybe even **most** people who consumed that work. Why couldn't they like that thing and you like your things? Instead we live in a world where people call their likes "super dumb" and "bullshit" in public places. Could you not have been informed about this in a neutral way that doesn't pour negativity on others who do enjoy it nevertheless? Although nobody "warned" you, if we lived in a world more like what OP is suggesting, chances are we'd have better ways of positively selecting for things we like.

    I don't know what the thing is since we're speaking abstractly, but I don't see why you couldn't have been informed via neutral identification ("constructive criticism") in one of those threads. "I really liked <art>, especially it's treatment of Y and Z. Note the author uses M to advance blah blah blah which made me feel like the integrity of Y was weakened if their goal was to engender feelings of A." Or you could have been that person that "saved" others like you who didn't get a clear enough identification from the others praising the work being referenced.

    I really like OP's stance and I'm having fun applying it to more than just here. It's challenging to imagine how our communications and workflows would differ from what they are today, but I think the long term effects of leaning positive, sharing identification work neutrally, and nullifying negativity would be quite magical in comparison to the status quo. I truly believe there would be a lot more great art as well because so many fewer people would be afraid of putting themselves out there. Currently there are wolves everywhere, both within and without any given tribe.

      > Negative criticism and identification are different things.

      I see the OP as explicitly calling out "identification of things the person does not like" as similar enough to negative criticism as to be discouraged. I don't think there is a reasonable case yet made about how we can reliably distinguish these things.

      This example: 

      >I really liked <art>, especially it's treatment of Y and Z. Note the author uses M to advance blah blah blah which made me feel like the integrity of Y was weakened if their goal was to engender feelings of A.

      Is a good effort, but I can still see people treating this as slapping the happy and injecting negativity in the proposed cultural norm.

      >And yet, there are probably other people that liked that thing! Maybe even most people who consumed that work. Why couldn't they like that thing and you like your things? 

      If I can ask this of you, please don't presume that I don't understand the difference between "taste" and objectively bad writing? It's one thing to dislike something someone else likes, and it's another for a writer to *write badly.* To "cheat," in a sense. I didn't explain the example because I didn't want to spoil things without warning, but I'm happy to go into specifics if this is a crux for you. To me this reads like "And yet there are probably other people who liked the way characters just teleported to wherever they needed to be without explanation in Game of Thrones later seasons!" If I'm not allowed to call that bullshit because some people enjoy things like that, then I feel like we're genuinely stifling criticism and making art worse, and not just letting people enjoy what they enjoy.

      >Instead we live in a world where people call their likes "super dumb" and "bullshit" in public places. Could you not have been informed about this in a neutral way that doesn't pour negativity on others who do enjoy it nevertheless? Although nobody "warned" you, if we lived in a world more like what OP is suggesting, chances are we'd have better ways of positively selecting for things we like.

      I'm not just using these strong phrases without thought: I am explicitly pushing back against the idea that, *in this subreddit,* there shouldn't be any sort of common understanding of what makes for *bad rational fiction.* If it's the words themselves that you object to, then maybe there's merit to refraining from using such words. But I still very much want to have a community that is comfortable calling out not just bad writing, but writing that violates the standards of the genre.
      ```

  This post kinda touches on one of my biggest irritations in rationalsphere relating to the use of the word "rational" or "rationalist" to describe the culture in general. The "rational/irrational" division is hard to avoid simply as a categorization scheme. I don't have any better alternative names and the cultural momentum behind "rational" is strong enough at this point I don't think it would matter if I did. But getting a group of people who enjoy something called "rational fiction" to not call things they don't like "*ir*rational fiction" feels tricky in an unstable-equilibrium sort of way.

  Maybe this post could be described as, "criticism tends to skew negative so try to adopt a moderate positivity bias to counteract that when writing critique"? Good negative criticism is important, especially to newer authors but framing the delivery can make a *huge* difference. Even just, "I found this plot point confusing and frustrating" instead of "this plot point was poorly written/bad"? I'm not sure how far to go in the "reduce negativity" direction but I feel like the answer is somewhere between "whatever is intuitive" and "all the way/eliminate all negativity".

  Finally,

  >If I was doing HPMOR over again, I would try to send clear(er) signals starting from page one that HPMOR was not meant as a delicious takedown of everything Rowling did wrong.

  Personally, I am glad you wrote it as you did. There is a particular sort of person who benefits from a story like HPMOR, someone who reads the first few chapters and is a bit confused why everyone thinks Harry is being so ridiculous, who is pretty sure Professor Quirrel is the Best Teacher Ever, and who loves laughing about snitches and gold exchange rates. Perhaps the negativity turned some people off and perhaps others took exactly the wrong lesson about cynicism (I've no idea how one would go about comparing the relative sizes of the population here) but I find a lot of value in the story as it stands.

  I agree that people shouldn't post pointless negativity. But I very much disagree with any attempt to discourage genuine criticism and contrasting opinions.

  It's just as useful for me to read why someone disliked a story as it is to read why someone else liked it. Both give me information I can use to decide whether I should consider reading it. I wouldn't want either side's voice diminished.

    Arguably, it’s even more useful. There’s sessentially unlimited amount of fiction that’s trivially easy to access. There are also many things I (and most others) need to divide my time between. At that point, reading (subjectively) bad fiction is a net negative. There’s a lot of value in being able to see immediately if a fic ticks off any of my immediate turnoffs so I know to avoid it entirely (and probably also the author’s other works).

  One person's dislike is another person's... treasure? Or at least, a 'meh.' For the same reason I browse 1- and 2-star reviews, critiques are 2.5x more helpful for me in determining if I want to give something a shot.

  Personally, I want people to tell me why they didn't like a story. I just don't want them to belittle the author or the fans.

  If you tell me why you bounced off something, that helps me figure out whether I'd like or dislike it.

  But if someone says bad things about the writer, or their fans, that doesn't help me have fun at all.

  I have a limited patience for bad Chinese translations, I rarely want to read political screeds, and I only sometimes want to read kinky sex. But there's one thing I never enjoy reading: people hating on any of the three for existing in the first place.

  Specific dislikes, good; judgmental rants, bad.

  The critics I like best? The ones who say "I didn't like it, but there's this other work that I did like." Then I know where the critic is coming from, and maybe I got a new work to check out for myself!

    It's gaming jargon. SAN is shorthand for sanity in some games and tabletop roleplaying systems, particularly ones related to Call of Cthulhu (the tabletop roleplaying system) where witnessing horror can cause your sanity score to be reduced. I think in this case it's specifically calling back to the passive drain of witnessing an eldritch creature, to claim being in the presence of negativity subtly harms us.

  *Since written text and internet communication aren’t very good at conveying tone and attitude, I’d just like to state that none of this post is intended as a criticism against you personally, that I do not have any negative feelings against you, and that I am thankful for your role in the creation of HPMOR, lesswrong, and /r/rational.*

  >and I would like to see us do better.

  What you define as "better" is not necessarily what other members of this community would appreciate as "better". I like seeing criticism of stories that get recommended. Criticism allows me to be better informed what story is being recommended and make a more accurate decision on whether or not I should give it a chance. Please don’t ruin this sub by forcefully turning it into yet another, polite-to-the-degree-of-meaninglessness, safe space.

  >I enjoy seeing recommendations of positive aspects of rationality-flavored stories that someone liked.  I would like to see fewer people responding with lists of what ought to be disliked about that work instead.

  Again, just because *you* enjoy it, doesn’t mean everyone comes here for positive-only reviews and recommendation information.

  > ideally, you read the first chapter of a story you turn out not to like, and then stop.  If it was a really bad recommendation, maybe you go back and downvote the recommending comment as a warning to others - without posting a reply showing off how much better you know.  

  Again, ideally for *whom*? You? I, for one, would like to know what made that other person to stop reading that story after one chapter. And would also like to get a summary of the story instead of a near-meaningless number next to the post linking to it.

  >Positive selection is when you can win by doing one thing very well.  Negative selection is when you have to pass a lot of filters where you do nothing wrong. .. It's okay to positively select stories with a high amount of some cool 'rational' stuff you enjoy, rather than demanding that every element avoid any trace of sin according to laws of what you think is 'irrational'.  Literary community is more fun when it runs on positive selection.

  The very premise on which this subreddit was originally formed was about filtering recommendations through *both* positive and negative selection criteria. "The story must not have deus ex machina solutions." "The characters’ behaviour should not be inconsistent." "The setting’s worldbuilding should not contradict itself." All these are negative selection criteria.

  > … is that often such people fail to question their own criticism.  …  Flaws have flaws.

  1) If a criticism is flawed, then nobody is stopping *other* members of the community from criticising the criticism itself. Through multi-level criticism discourse arises, and through discourse a better and more accurate description about the subject story is created. 

  > I have seen a lot of purported "flaws", in my own work and in others', that were simply missing the point.  

  2) Just because *you* think a criticism was "missing the point" or was flawed doesn’t mean it really was. You yourself could have been a biased side (especially given how you’d have vested interest in your own works). If you think a criticism is missing a point, feel free to join in and reply to it, or let others criticise it instead. Don’t just declare it to be missing the point or flawed by your authoritative word alone.

  >… Then if you read a Reddit thread that thinks it's supposed to be about calling out flaws, the commenters you see may be selected for (a) having unusually low thresholds T_i before they speak and/or (b) having high upward errors E_i in their estimates of the target's mistakenness.  

  This would’ve been a problem if criticisms / reviews presented on dicsussion forums like this weren’t a qualitative analysis instead of a quantitative one. People don’t just inform others that a story contains a flaw once that flaw passed through their "low threshold". They describe exactly what they think the flaw / mistake was. And others are welcome to disagree with them if they deem their opinion to be inaccurate or incorrect.

  >  If I was doing HPMOR over again, I would try to send clear(er) signals starting from page one that HPMOR was not meant as a delicious takedown of everything Rowling did wrong.

  But you did not, and HPMOR ended up being perceived at least partially as criticism of things done *wrong* by JKR, and then this community emerged — at least partially to address the interests of those people who were interested in discussing the *negative* selection criteria as well as the positive ones. And I am glad you didn’t, because otherwise this sub may not have had existed in its current form and spirit. This sub is outside of your control now, even if your work was among the things that helped create it. Please don’t try to forcefuly redefine it because it feels unsatisfactory to *your* tastes and values.

    >.. besides missing the entire concept of the Cool Stuff Theory of Literature

    You’ve introduced that theory only several paragraphs higher, haven’t proven it yourself to a sufficient degree, and now are already trying to use it as a basis for validating other points you make.

    >The world already contains a sufficient quantity of sadness. If an artistic experience is making somebody happy, you should not be trying to interfere with their happiness under a supermajority of ordinary circumstances.

    This feels to me like one of those arguments that are so bad that one doesn’t even know where to start with the counter-arguments against it. I’ll try: 1) the statement made in these two sentences sounds technically so vague that at face value doesn’t even have anything to do with the thread’s subject matter. 2) If we assume that its intended meaning is "you should not criticise something if that something is making somebody happy", then I disagree because with a reasoning like that the recommendations-as-valuable-information would at best quickly and significantly drop in quality and at worst turn into noise.

    > going around declaring that some other piece of work contains a flaw and is therefore "irrational" 

    Definition of what is "rational" and what is not varies between different members of this community.

    >The word 'rational' is properly used under very restrictive circumstances to refer to properties of general cognitive algorithms, not to particular acts or events. 

    Words can have different meanings in different contexts and subcultures. Clearly in this subreddit / subculture "rational" has ended up acquiring a meaning to depict a specific literary genre. There is nothing "improper" about using that word to convey that meaning. Although, different users of this sub do have different definitions of what a "rational" story is and is not, and there can often arise miscommunications when they use the same word to mean different things. But that’s a problem for another discussion.

    >when public criticism runs amok, people end up living in a mental world where it's low-status and a sign of vulnerability to admit you enjoyed something.

    That conclusion doesn’t follow from that premise at all.

    >I personally just get the shivers (not good shivers, metal-screeching-on-a-blackboard shivers) almost every time I hear somebody declare that something is 'irrational'. 

    Again, that’s on you. And it’s not an objectively made argument.

    >It's fun to enjoy something in public without feeling ashamed of yourself.

    1) Just because "it’s fun" isn’t an argument in this case. As an example, meme-posting is fun for meme-posters. Meme-posting still creates noise and has to be regulated in quality subreddits. 2) Nobody’s saying anything about enjoying the stories or even doing that in public. If someone’s feeling ashamed from others criticising the story they like, that’s on them.

    >But most people's enjoyment is fragile enough that anyone present effectively has a veto - a punishment button that not only smashes the smile, but conditions that person not to smile again where anyone can see them. 

    This is a bad argument. If we prioritised "fragile enjoyment" of every person out there over content and discussion quality, the sub’s content would turn into meaningless (even if "positive" and "fun") noise.

    >a harsh reply will have less smile-prevention power if the original comment is upvoted to 7 and the harsh reply downvoted to -3.

    And now you’re encouraging to downvote comments that would be perceived as negative based on your previous bad argument. Bad arguments / replies, unless they are *really* bad, should be criticised as bad, not downvote-brigadded. 

    >If you are voluntarily having a non-gainful unpleasant experience, you should stop.  ..  The credo "Don't like, don't read" is simple and correct ..  Don't like, stop reading.

    You are presenting your opinion as truth. As examples: someone can be both liking and disliking the same story, someone can be out of really-good things to read, someone could be reading a bad story just to be able to accurately criticise it, etc. Possible goals and motivations can be very different, and the credo you’ve mentioned didn’t even consider them at all.

    >To shake a finger and say, "Ah, but you see..." does not always make you look smart.

    You’re assuming they’re criticising it to look smart. Try to assume good faith instead of presenting an unsupported ad-hominem and moving on.

    >It's so awful, in fact, that you probably don't want to hang out on any Reddits that think their purpose is to call out flaws in things.

    If you don’t want to hang on reddits then just don’t hang on reddits, instead of trying to convert the subs into facebook fan groups.

    > If a comment somewhere seems to be written in clear ignorance of our bias toward people saying what they enjoyed, and is trying to counter that enjoyment by saying what should have been hated - then just link them to this post, and maybe downvote the original comment.

    Even in a hypothetical case of a subreddit rule being passed that would disallow taste-shaming, I think linking to this specific thread would’ve been a bad decision, because most of the arguments made in the OP-post are bad.

    >when somebody says they enjoyed something, and you respond by telling them why they were wrong to enjoy it.

    I agree with this. With the provisions that criticisng that work in turn is not the same as telling them they were wrong to enjoy it — especially when the discussion was happening in a recommendation thread.


    >  Not every story needs to contain every kind of cool stuff.

    -

    > In a lot of cases it's just being used to mean, "Well, I thought that part of the story should've gone differently."

    I agree on these.

    > we do not have solid information about what goes on inside of other people's heads ..  please don't tell me what bad things the author was thinking unless the author plainly came out and said so.  You're not an author telepath.

    I agree with this. Making baseless assumptions about others (including story writers) is not a nice thing to do. More than that, I’d argue that stories should be criticised as-is. What the author of the story has or has not done should *not* be treated as relevant information or a valid point of criticism.

    >The economy in xianxia worlds makes no sense, you say?  Perhaps xianxia readers are not reading xianxia in order to get a vitamin of good economics.  

    I agree that opinions like this can’t count as valid points of criticism, but I disagree that users should be encouraged to not mention such opinions at all. It’s better to have a warning that "economy in xianxia worlds makes no sense" than not, since for those readers who *are* "reading xianxia in order to get a vitamin of good economics" such information will end up being very valuable and useful. I agree that it should be stressed by the reviewers that such opinions should not be treated as pieces of direct criticism. 

    >When tempted to go on angry rants in public about fiction you don't like, it would not do to overlook the larger context that your entire civilization is going mad with anger and despair, and you might have been infected.  

    I don’t get what this has to do anything with literary criticism. Unless you mean culture wars infecting things. In which case I agree that people should "self-scan" against such infections. 

    >Even if you are genuinely able to gain purely positive happiness from angry negativity without that poisoning you, other people around you are not having as much fun. 

    You seem to be using negativity and criticism interchangeably (unless I am misunderstanding you). If you are not, than I agree that toxicity should also be self-censured and community-censured.

    >"But I just meant to help the author by pointing out what they did wrong!"  If you try delivering your critique to the author in private, they may find it much more credible that you meant only to help them, and weren't trying to gain status by pushing them down in public.  

    My problem with this thread is for the attempt to censor negative story reviews. I don’t want to address author-reader feedback one way or another. I’ll just say that different authors may have opinions on this that may be different from yours, so you shouln’t be speaking for them all.

  Contexts I like negativity:

  * Recommendation threads.  If someone [Recommended Ack's Security](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2sbzdg/rt_ff_security_a_worm_selfinsert/) to me, I would want to receive a counter recommendation before I wasted an hour on it to realize that it leaned heavily into feel good fix-fic with Author Fiat and Fanon helping the author insert.  In general, if a bit of negativity can help someone sort through recommendations and find what they want, that is good.
  * Building in-group loyalty on easy targets that no one will be offended by.  When someone makes fun of the DCEU Superman or Justice League in favor of the Metropolitan Man, everyone can share a laugh together.
  * Sexism/Nazism/Racism.  If someone wants to push a blatant agenda in terms of white supremacy or hating women or anything like that, I am okay with mocking them a bit.
  * Low effort brainstorming.  If someone's throwing around random open ended ideas, I feel okay with shooting them down

  Contexts I (partly) agree with you. (But I am not sure it if a big enough problem to be worth making a rule over)

  * First time authors linking their stuff here.  If someone's actually written a few chapters and they are looking for feedback, I think we should incentivize that by giving encouragement and making sure any criticism is constructive.  If there writing is absolutely not a fit for /r/rational perhaps ignoring their posts or referring them to more related fandom subreddits is a better choice than hating on them
  * Content creators providing overall good content (I think you fall into this category) getting bashed repeatedly.  Yes, although HPMOR is the originator of the rationalist fanfic concept and yes there may have been better examples written since it, I don't think everyone needs to put it down when bringing up another fanfic just cause HPMOR can be a little cringe here and there.

  Also why you are on that topic

  >If I was doing HPMOR over again, I would try to send clear(er) signals  starting from page one that HPMOR was not meant as a delicious takedown  of everything Rowling did wrong.

  There is an audience for a making fun of Rowling fic (pooping in the hallways and vanishing it deserves a good sneer).  But yeah, if you attract that audience you are likely to repel other audiences (people that absolutely love Harry Potter, but consider themselves discerning (picky) about what fanfics they like).

  You may have attracted a large number of sneerers... but I think strong fandoms tend to do that regardless of content.  The extreme example is Star Wars.  Hardcore Star Wars fans often hate Starwars.  They hated the prequels... up until the sequels came out and then hatred shifted targets enough that nostalgia and memes outweighed them.  According to older star wars fans, apparently a lot of fans hated the Ewoks when they first came out.  I think HPMOR is in a similar position.  The whole meta-contrarian thing along with the nature of fanfic fandom means that of course the readers are going to nitpick and such.  You do kind of amplify the message with provocative statements [like](https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/a21jrp/what_was_the_purpose_of_this_description_of_the/eaxfm6n/)

  >It’s OK to be imperfect, just not so imperfect that people notice. So I  challenge you (or anyone) to exhibit any paragraph in HPMOR, and delete a  sentence from it, in a way that makes it better.

  Also, minor messaging note... this post is pretty heavy on metaphors, unique terminology defined in post (Holm's Maxim), and weird sentence constructions (slap not the happy), almost to the point of making it hard to parse the ideas.  I know in the sequences you've gotten okay mileage out of using counter-intuitive wordings and such to encourage deeper thought but in this context of a community post aiming to articulate a relatively simple idea, it comes across as borderline [Deepity](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Deepity) (or to use your own terminology back at you [Pretending to Be Wise](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/jeyvzALDbjdjjv5RW/pretending-to-be-wise)).

    It was super mixed. They have a great Little Fuzzy vibe, and cute murderers are a popular trope, but they were also obviously a marketing ploy. I had a love-hate thing going with them, but I still cheered them smashing up troopers with log traps. What really bugged me about that movie was Vader's free ticket to Jedi Ghost Heaven.

    You realize those have fans, right? 

    Personally I quite like them, and wish people didn't performatively crap on them to seem cool - in general, I actually haven't noticed that here - just because they've acquired some kind of "acceptable target" status in the media. I actually think that my favourite parts of the DCEU have a lot of parallels with ratfic (e.g. Batman's motives in BvS are similar to Metropolitan Man's Lex.)

    Given that they're quite financially succesful, and the least successful one was also the least DCEU-like (Justice League), I'm pretty sure there are quite a *lot* of DCEU fans who probably feel bad when they see this. Although I could be typical-minding.

      In-group references: Negativity deals SAN damage.

      Using an equation instead of words to explain something...

      In general a "Contents" outline summary should provide the reader with an idea of what they about to read, not use a bunch of in-group jargon that requires that you read ahead just to understand what is being said.  Eliezer made this work okayish in the original lesswrong sequences: he defined terminology as he went and then linked back to the terminology.  I think it mostly worked in the sequences, each article would introduce about one new term in an overall manageable rate.  Even then though, critics pointed out that he often reinvented existing academic terms in a way that made the community inaccessible to actual academics and completely incomprehensible to people reading isolated posts.  In this reddit post, even the Contents summary is saturated with terminology, jargon, obscure references, etc.  I can read it, because I have followed EY's stuff long enough to recognize most references, but it still makes it a pain to read.  For someone who came from another fanfiction community and hadn't followed years of EY internet history, this post might be even more of a pain to read.

        So you're saying that for a new reader of /r/rational the contents of EY's proposal would be unnecessarily hard to understand? A good summary is [nytelios' comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/dvkv41/meta_reducing_negativity_on_rrational/f7djmye/) (/u/nytelios pinging because link). To me, it's very intuitive and required basically no effort to get through.

        As you may see I am making this comment from a motivated position as I support the proposal. It doesn't mean eliminating constructive criticism, it just means phrasing things in a slightly different way so as not to give people the implication that you're looking down on them in some way, because that's not OK in an egalitarian society as /r/rational should be. Again, I'm totally *for* constructive criticism, but as EY says, it's more credible that it *is* constructive if given in private. Too often people say things just to gain (perceived) "status" from pulling others down. Again, all this policy is saying is that this particular thing is not OK.

  Some of the following is tangential but I'm not sure how much of it, so I'm just leaving it all in.

  I definitely agree when it's something like "this kind of thing is cool" or "I don't like this kind of thing, regardless of how well-crafted it is" but I don't agree if it's "this story is well-crafted in this particular way" or "this is a plot hole". If I like something I believe it is able to withstand criticism, and accepting and learning more about its weaknesses makes genuine appreciate better because if you like something without needing to shield your eyes from the bad parts then you like it more than if you don't. If you will dislike something because of a certain criticism then the criticism must contain something you care about, right? Isn't it better to be informed about the things you care about?

  I tend to think on the subreddit specifically that it's essentially impossible to enforce the clear separation of "here's a criticism" and "people shouldn't like this". Maybe it's worth the effort to try anyway.

  I think that negative reviews are useful because their absence in a popular thread is evidence that it's good. If there's a culture against such comments then it makes that evidence weaker.

  For example, I often anti-recommend Homestuck when it comes up because I believe it is deceitfully good, that it looks good at first and gradually becomes a mess that I didn't like at all and I feel my time was wasted and I certainly would have wanted someone to warn me about it before I started. In the same way that it is useful for people to positively recommend things it is useful for people to negatively recommend them.

  It's certainly good to discuss the appropriateness of stories to this forum, the extent to which they are rational, but it's also good to discuss their merit in other ways, because people's interests are not so chaotic that other people's reviews are useless, especially conditioned on being subscribed here.

  > It's fun to enjoy something in public without feeling ashamed of yourself.  If you're part of Generation Z, you may have never known this feeling, but trust me, it's fun!  But most people's enjoyment is fragile enough that anyone present effectively has a veto - a punishment button that not only smashes the smile, but conditions that person not to smile again where anyone can see them.  In this sense we are all in a multi-party prisoner's dilemma, a public commons that anyone can burn.  But even if somebody defects and tries to kill a smile, the situation may not be beyond repair; a harsh reply will have less smile-prevention power if the original comment is upvoted to 7 and the harsh reply downvoted to -3.  If we all contribute to that, maybe you'll be able to be publicly happy too!  Public enjoyment is a public good.

  I think this is the strongest counterpoint to what I'm saying. I'll have to think more about it. I *guess* people unwittingly liking things against their own values could be a good thing. I have conflicting intuitions about that.

  I find reasonable negativity valuable. I feel the internet is overflowing with empty positivity already, as weird as it souds. For example, most books on Goodreads are within .2 points from four stars, and the published authors are wont to indiscriminately praise each other's works and never say anything bad. Anyone can like anything for any reason, and even the people who appear most similar to me often turn out to have vastly different tastes in what's sufficiently cool to look past the flaws. The variety of perspectives when it comes to recommendations, both positive corroborations and negative counters, "flesh out" a recommendation, as opposed to being a meaningless signal boost "I liked a thing, it's a cool thing".

  I generally agree kinkshaming is not cool. But wow, what a wall of text! The post and the comments! I gather you want people at r/rational to not overly harsh in criticism, or at least recognizing that delivering criticism can take enjoyment out of people if not done skillfully. That I agree. But two points I don't.

  >Literary community is more fun when it runs on positive selection. 

  But r/rational has hoops to jump through to get recommended here. It's not a lot, it's only five bullet points going by sidebar. One of them (rationalist) is not even a requirement. It's just there to mark a special sub-genre. Any fiction passed those hoops deserved to be talked about extensively here. Both to be loved or to be hated. Fictions that do not, get told "I (dis)like your work, but finding this and this in it, this subreddit is not the suitable place for it. See you again in other sub." I did this when mooderino's Deeper Darker get recommended.

  Basically, this sub is rational fiction sub. If we're enjoying beauty of poetry, we're not doing it here.

  > Credibly helpful unsolicited criticism should be delivered in private.

  I've upvoted others' comments that expand on this point. I'm not sure what trigger your post, not being here for about two months. But I know we're a bit of a snob. I'm very snobby myself. But reading snobby reviews helps me avoid yet another fiction that felt like a waste of time. I like to think both author and reader benefit from reading all these snobby reviews. Recognizing which to be taken to heart and which to be ignored entirely. I mean, I still going to give a fiction a read if the reviewer (her)himself is not trustworthy.
  ```

- u/musicmage4114:
  ```
  I'll start by seconding the critiques other people have given. The ability to do this is one reason why "credibly helpful criticism" shouldn't only be transmitted privately. If I take my role as a critic seriously, but have no idea what others have said, then I have to bring up every possible point of criticism I can think of, even if the author has already heard it from someone else. Not only does this create an unnecessary burden on critics (whether criticism is solicited or not) it can also be tiresome for an author to read the same critique over and over again, all of which can be avoided if critique is offered publicly.

  >Telepathic critics don't distinguish their observations from their inferences at all, let alone weigh alternative possibilities.  Not as a matter of rationalfic, but as a matter of this being a literary subreddit at all, please don't tell me what bad things the author was thinking unless the author plainly came out and said so.  You're not an author telepath.

  This is fine, however...

  >There may sometimes be a positive purpose for public criticism, but almost always that purpose is not purely trying to help the targets.

  *You're not a critic telepath.* You do not get to request that critics assume good faith of authors while simultaneously advocating assuming bad faith of critics.

  >If you're part of Generation Z, you may have never known this feeling, but trust me, it's fun! But most people's enjoyment is fragile enough that anyone present effectively has a veto - a punishment button that not only smashes the smile, but conditions that person not to smile again where anyone can see them.

  This does not ring true to me and is probably unfalsifiable (not to mention needlessly condescending), and it weakens your argument. You could downgrade "most" to "some" and base your argument on empathy ("We have no way of knowing who these people are, so we should err on the side of caution!") rather than utilitarianism ("Odds are you'll hurt someone's feelings, so the safest choice is not to do it!") and it would still make your point.

  > It is still true, in general, that it is possible to do even worse by feeling even more upset about it.

  In general, criticism is not a product of anger, nor are people who offer criticism generally upset about the thing they're criticizing. I would argue that such a worldview is potentially far more mentally harmful to authors than whatever criticism they might receive.

  Even it was and they are, what does "hypersensitivity" have to do with it? Hypersensitive to what, exactly? If something about a text bothers someone because they're "sensitive" to it (things that might be included in content warnings, for example), odds are they will follow your next piece of advice and simply stop reading.

  Should people just surrender to the tides of their emotions and give up on trying to regulate them to some extent? No, of course not, and harassment is never okay. But even if some people *are* upset about a text, framing it as simply "hypersensitivity" on the part of the audience absolves authors of any responsibility they might have.

  Maybe it's a bit mean-spirited of me, but I kind of enjoy reading snarky, acerbic takedowns of middling works, specifically in those cases where their authors feel to me to be undeservedly arrogant, or claim writing quality beyond that which is merited by the text. It evokes feeling similar to seeing (fictional) bullies themselves get bullied. And maybe when they champion positions I don't agree with -- then it's more tickling those 'boo outgroup!' parts of me, I guess. But I can also see areas where "try[ing] to convince someone who liked a thing that they shouldn't have" is warranted, if the thing they like is problematic in some shape or form. If someone's eating food that poisons the body, we should discourage them from further consumption, even *if* they really enjoy it; so too should we discourage enjoyment of works that poison the mind, or at least encourage further introspection on why those things are enjoyed and what that enjoyment says about ourselves. 

  (and I enjoy reading criticisms of things I like more than things I don't, because the latter tend to be more challenging and novel, forcing me to consider matters from a perspective further from my own. If anything, it makes me enjoy the thing I like more!)

  (and I do agree that if people are reading things they dislike and seething in unpleasantness -- while also not being challenged -- then they should probably not read the thing that they dislike. But watching bad movies or reading bad fiction can be entertaining in its own right, too!)

  It also feels a bit vindicating when you've not liked something others have; finding like minds means you're not alone in your displeasure. And it's often interesting to probe why you don't like something, especially if it's just a small part of a work that you've otherwise enjoyed. That probing seems like it requires examination through a critical lens. It can also serve as a springboard to explore possible improvements -- and you're a lot more likely to kick off a discussion with a public audience than 'delivering your criticism in private', which is almost certainly going to be ignored (and I'm not a fiction author, but if I were I'd think I'd much prefer public discussions, since then I'd be more able to gauge consensus opinion and distinguish common views from uncommon ones. When I've, say, circulated a manuscript for critique, I much prefer discussing it in a group over 1-on-1, because then people can jump in and say "yes I agree" or "no I disagree" over me having to guess, and I think this would be even more important if I were writing for fans' enjoyment). And there are the benefits described elsewhere nearby -- at the margin, criticism helps readers decide whether they should read something or not much more informatively than more praise.

  If readers or authors are being negatively affected by criticism (or, err, being swallowed by "an insane, debilitating, addictive, mental-health-destroying, civilization-wrecking cascade of negativity" -- not sure what this is referring to, maybe like death threats? those certainly should never be allowed), though, it seems there are plenty of middle grounds to investigate, like:

  * authors providing explicit statements of skin thickness -- how much criticism they'd prefer to see from readers, and how gently or harshly that criticism should be presented. Deviation from authors' stated preferences could be met with community shunning or withdrawal of work

  * trigger warnings before any critical statements, with offending text obscured by spoiler tags >!like this!< Then authors and readers can decide to read or not to read the text, informed of its flavor beforehand

  * promoting community norms for sandwich criticisms inside compliments to soften the blow of the former. You want to say something mean about something, you need to say two nice thing about that thing too

  edit: also, I swear I've read something similar to this on here before, but I can't seem to find it  ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ and I'd say this forum is generally a lot cuddlier than most of the others I've seen, at least when it comes to established, recurring works, though there'd be an obvious filter at play there

  The underlying idea that anyone *can* convince anyone else to not like a thing, or that anyone even *tries* to do so is so bizarre to me. I've seen a lot of conversations online, a lot of arguments, but not once in my admittedly faulty memory do I remember an argument where someone was trying to convince someone else that they shouldn't like something. People argue merits of the work, or (in the worst cases) insult the other person for being a great big dum-dum, but that's about it. The fact that apparently some people *do* see some arguments like that makes me honestly uneasy.

  Further, the implication is that since there are arguments like that, presumably sometimes they are successful? Otherwise nobody would have them, right? So what, there are people out there who like a thing, a stranger tells them "no don't like that thing", and they stop?

  Have you considered taking opinions of literal strangers online a tad less seriously? At least not to the point where it actually dictates the things you are allowed to like?

  On a subreddit level, if a new work is posted and I am looking for stuff to read, I may check out the comments. If someone in the comments mentions points A, B and C about the work that they really liked, this is information for me - it tells me what kind of things people like about this work. Now, on a subreddit like this, I can also rely on other people having broadly similar tastes to mine. If I then see a comment critiquing points A, B and C as a response, and the response seems coherent, I know that maybe the original commenter wasn't all that accurate. On the other hand, if I see _no_ substantial critique to a positive post in a frequently-visited comment thread, then I know all those positive points are solid, because in the counterfactual world where there were factual points undermining the points A, B and C, *someone similar to me would have already complained about them.* Here, the culture of complaining about factual inaccuracies in comments directly affects the information about a book I get from reading some comments. That makes it easier for me to search for things I'll like, and I don't want this to go away.

    Agreed. With how much time I have available to read, being able to better prioritize which stories I'm likely to enjoy most is already hard enough to do without removing extra information from discussions. 

    If that information constitutes a "sanity harm hazard," maybe we can instead push for a way to list all criticism of a posted story or discussion under its own thread, so people can just minimize the top-level comment that they would be grouped under without having to see them if they don't want to?

    >The underlying idea that anyone can convince anyone else to not like a thing, or that anyone even tries to do so is so bizarre to me

    What if we modify it a little, and say the claim is rather that "People guilt and shame each other for what they like, for example by explaining how the story they enjoyed was actually not \`rational\`, implying they shouldn't have enjoyed it."

    I think this is more what OP meant, as well as a claim that I can personally get behind. It's less that A tries to convince B "you should stop liking work X", and more that A pedagogically explains to B (who liked X) why X is not truly \`rational\` and why, in their expert opinion, A should not have liked X, but rather liked Y and Z which A likes much better.

    The result is not that B is convinced that they don't actually like X, and more that B feels ashamed of liking X, feels like they violated group norms, and need to better conform to the groups evaluation of what works fit its theme. B feels embarrassed to admit they like a work without having checked whether the work fits the community guidelines, and in the future, regardless of their personal enjoyment of a work, is less likely to publicly state their opinion without checking for a known community evaluation. Which is a terrible, terrible result that destroys diversity of tastes, destroys the ability to take unbiased samples of reader opinion, and reduces everything to a Girardian mimises / Communist Party "I can only publicly say I like things that more important people said they liked" world.

    The bottom line wasn't "don't criticize." It was "If someone enjoyed something, don't try to talk them out of it, or shame/guilt them for it."

  I agree that telling people they shouldn’t like what they like is generally something to avoid. But I am not sure that the negative criticisms of this subreddit take on that form all that much. They tend to discuss the work at hand instead of telling people why they shouldn’t like it. 

  Another point to consider is that negative criticisms are much more useful for filtering out things we would not like. The positive comments tend to be similar to each other, even to the positive comments praising other books, but negative comments are generally specific to a work, usually with examples to demonstrate their point. In my opinion, online reviews in places like goodreads or royalroad make this imbalance between positive and negative clear, and negative reviews are what I consider when deciding to read. Of course low quality negative comments exist, ones that should be ignored, but I do not think they are a problem in this community. 

  I am also not sure  if criticisms of irrationality in fiction are a bad thing. Perhaps “not rational” is a better way of saying that than “irrational”. Since it would be more neutral. But not criticising that irrationality would be quite difficult, as vast majority of fiction is not rational and this community is in a way a reaction to that. Though I do agree stating a book being irrational is generally not a useful statement by itself, as not being rational doesn’t equal to not being good. 

  It could also be argued that since rational fiction is a tiny minority of fiction, it remains mostly reactive to all the other non rational fiction out there. And trying to remove the reactive/critical attitude towards these would be removing a crucial part of what being part of this community is. Indeed, I would argue rational fiction community is less about reading rational fiction, as there is precious few of those, and more about our shared dislike to what we deem irrational in fiction.

  Personally I do find it easier to wax poetic about the flaws of a story than the good parts. Perhaps partly because the good parts are immersive, and get folded into "It was a good story, I enjoyed it." While the flaws grab my attention like splinters. 

  I think a guidance encouraging mentioning positive features would be great, but there shouldn't be a policy preventing criticism (except possibly unhelpfully vague and crude criticism, or purely ad-hominem attacks on the author).

- u/megazver:

  Negative reviews are useful to readers. Both when they make good points and especially so when they're wrong - when I click on negative reviews for, for the latest example I personally encountered, the recently released instant classic CRPG Disco Elysium and the negative reviews are all either "too much reding ughg i dunwana read" or "oof yikes there are prejudiced characters in the game - and portrayal is *obviously* endorsement, 0/10, cancel the dev", those are actually more likely to make the target audience for the game and me personally buy it. Same thing with novels. If someone complains about economics in xianxia and I don't care about economics in xianxia, I am not affected by that negative opinion in any way and might, in fact, want to read it more. 

  Now, if someone actually posts their work here I strongly encourage being tactful in your feedback and perhaps not even posting anything if you didn't think it was good. But otherwise having people share their positive and negative opinions is very useful to others.

  I think we could do without the passive-aggressive [Story You Mentioned](It's Low Quality Lol) Bot, though. It's not bringing any value and it's kind of petty.
  ```

- u/meterion:
  ```
  This is a bizarre policy proposal. Why do you think policing negative feedback is something that has any place on a forum for posting literature? Let's go down the list:

  * Slap not the happy

  This is assuming that discussing the negative points of a story is inherently "sad", which I can personally say is bunk. Please don't interfere with my happiness in my experience of critiquing stories :(

  * Art runs on positive vitamins

  In my own lurking at /r/r, I don't see anyone saying this. I think it's a pretty basic theory of literary critique to accept strange premises as they are and consider instead their internal consistency and realism, and it's one that gets followed here.

  * 'Rational X' is an idea for a new story, not a criticism of an old story.

  This is literally just a form of *ad hominem*, or more loosely, [*ergo decedo*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergo_decedo).  

  ~~* Criticism easily goes wrong.~~

  I'm not a math-y kind of guy so i'm not gonna try to read this part.

  * Negativity deals SAN damage.

  Half of these examples are entirely tangential to the point you're making. Derailing threads to talk about a part of a story you didn't like is undesirable and completely separate from the solution of censoring that kind of talk entirely. Downvoting a previously-upped recommendation post provides zero "warning" against it, since reddit doesn't display up/down ratios of comments. Replies are the only way to do so.

  I find it just slightly ironic that you say "hypersensitivity is unhealthy" and then apply it to scold readers who don't like a story. Is it not unhealthy to propose that authors live in a positivity hugbox? Lastly, the point about "stop reading things you don't like" is actually entirely in-line with a pro-negativity stance. If someone replies to a story rec that they stopped liking such-and-such story because of X, that is entirely useful data for both authors and potential readers to judge why one story is more popular than another.

  * Say not irrationalfic.

  One-word criticisms are generally not useful, I agree. But this is not something that can only be "fixed" by bringing down the banhammer on negativity as a whole, but encouraging it to be more thought out.

  Overall, this feels like a very wordy rephrasing of the "Just turn your brain off" mentality, and I'm not seeing any real improvements on the arguments for it since I last saw it brought up. Free discussion is good, criticism can lead to a more nuanced understanding of a work. If someone doesn't their engagement of a work "ruined" by someone replying to them with bad things, it is as easy as not engaging.

  I'm fine with the "don't be a dick" part.

  But I'm strongly against the implication that I shouldn't tell others why I dislike a story, and that others should also not tell me why they dislike a story.

  A simple example would be the MC being switched to someone else 70 chapters in. I'm not against multi-MC stories, but I prefer that the majority of the MCs get introduced within the first 10 to 15 chapters. So I appreciate being told that the MC of the story changes.

  Another example would be a comedy I'm reading turns into a dark tragedy halfway in. I read my comedies for a purpose, and I don't want them to change into something else. So I'd be pissed if censorship prevents me from discovering something important like that.

  Thank you. I find much of what you've written here accurate and helpful. 

  Specific things that stick out for me are that positive vitamins are crucial to my creative psyche, and I suspect they are to most. And I hadn't thought it so clearly before but, criticism reflects upon the critic as much as the criticized (and it's hard to often see that).

  I try to model the behavior I want to see in others...by being positive, even when I disagree, and when I have criticism to offer either to the author or to the community, doing so in a way I think is supportive rather than destructive.

  (Personally, math analogies are useless to me. The broadcast criticism paragraph left me confused)

  I haven't felt as much overt criticism here as maybe there is implied in your post (though you qualified that early on), but I don't always read all threads closely. 

  However, when I see a 3,000 word chapter posted and a comment (or the only comment) consists solely of: "You misspelled 'parallel'.", I cringe. Tell the author you like the story! Or (if that'd be a lie) what you found interesting enough to want to improve it by correcting a tiny mistake. And do that via PM. 

  I try to frame a dislike as a personal response rather than a universal one and couch it in socially mediated phrasing. That goes a long way. ("It didn't make sense to me that the girl's dress..." vs "It's stupid that...") And it's more accurate, 'cause, maybe I missed something.

  I'm not always successful, I fail and respond with kneejerk comments, but I'm trying.

  Again, thanks for caring enough to put this out there.

  Lots of excellent points to convince people to self-police their negativity and also feels over-the-top for what I think are some simple messages: 

  - Don't be a dick. 
  - Unnecessary public criticism spawns negativity and negativity takes away people's enjoyment. 
  - Criticism is not always true, valid, wanted, or helpful. Think before you hate.
  - Everyone has different opinions and tastes.
  - Positivity makes the world a better place.

  Personally, I like seeing lists of what ought to be disliked, as long as it's constructively critical rather than invective or kneejerk resentment. It provokes discussion plus, from a more cynical perspective, people like complaining and echo chambers of positivity are so stale. I feel like I'm shaking my finger here and saying 'flaws have flaws have flaws', but I think this post is a great reminder to the community that positivity is almost always worth more than negativity. 

  On the actual points, I thought 2C, 4A/C, 5A/B/C/F/G were the most useful addendums to Holm's callout.

  Points 2A, 2B, 3 + 6 basically = If what you're really saying is 'Well, *I* thought that part of the story should've gone differently', then it's better to call it your opinion rather than a flaw, since nothing^^^exclusions ^^^apply will ever be tailored to your exact preference.

  My currently trending thoughts on this topic, written at short length:

  It sounds like the major considerations to be balanced are:

  \- Preserving an environment in which people feel like it's okay to be enthusiastic about works in public, despite the inevitability that at least one out of a thousand viewers will feel like the work doesn't deserve that much liking.  (Having had the chance to observe the way this actually plays out in practice across many discussions, I am reasonably sure that one mildly negative commenter who chimes in with a Wellackshually implying that it was wrong to like the work, results in *much* less public enthusiasm during the rest of that conversation.)

  \- People who prefer tempered recommendation processes, being able to hear about possible negative views of a work before trying to read the first chapter of it.  (This practice comes with dangers that should be obvious, but has some real upside, especially if scheduling the read of a first chapter or abandoning a work after starting comes at a high cost to somebody.)

  \- Being able to consider and optimize literary qualities.

  Being a nerd, I've imagined a partially-technological solution to this political problem; if /u/Lightwavers (or someone) is willing to implement [a bot that automatically links to wiki pages allocated for each work](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/dvoq4i/meta_are_the_low_quality_tags_too_harsh/f7eyixy/) recommended on /r/rational.  (I am potentially willing to pay somebody to do this.)  We could then have the following etiquette:

  \- Holm's Maxim governs recommendation threads, open threads, and enthusiastic mentions in passing of another work during a thread not about that work specifically.  When somebody says they like something, don't respond with a reason why they or other people shouldn't like it.

  \- On the wiki page of a work (which will be automatically linked by a bot), people are welcome to discuss their own reasons for liking or disliking that work, without the appearance of replying to anyone else, and with etiquette saying that you are not allowed to imply that other people shouldn't like something - only discuss your own reasons and leave the generalization up to them.  Yes, even if the author killed a guy.

  \- On discussion threads for a work's particular chapter, people may debate the well-executedness of some particular feature of that work's particular chapter.  Comments saying that nobody should enjoy this whole work are still verboten.  Replies here should still follow the etiquette of saying "Mileage varied: I thought character X seemed stupid to me" rather than saying "No, character X was actually quite stupid."

    I'll be honest, I feel none of this is needed and you're trying to over-engineer a solution for a problem that doesn't exist.

    And if anyone wants a database of works that contain whatever it is they find objectionable, I 
    don't feel it's a good idea for the sub itself to be involved in this, but I encourage anyone who's interested to set up whatever they want off-site and it can get linked in the sidebar.

    You signal that this cost is small. As an author, you see your work as a unit; people can spend constant effort to maybe gain linear reward. As a reader, I see the communities output as a unit; expecting to like only a small number of stories, I can spend linear effort to gain linear reward.

    A reddit optimizes the time spent reading opinions better than a wiki - the most agreed opinions rise to the top, their flaws and associations are pointed out in replies.

    I expect that an external site to gather readers reactions would remain mostly unused due to trivial inconvenience. If you disagree, we could have the external site that the bot links to be the safe space, and reddit norms remain as they are. Aspiring authors could post there and ignore reddit if they need such.

  I like this post. I think it's important as a writing community to consider how we give and receive criticism. Every author needs to hear it, and readers need it too, but in what manner is the question.

  This sub in particular is rather comfortable with giving and receiving harsh criticism. It isn't like that on all writing forums. Some are much more positive in general, and geared more towards moral support than actually improving writing.

  I will say, however, that this sub does tend towards being negative and highly critical, even when they LIKE something. This can give an author (and potential readers) the opinion you don't like the story when it's the opposite. I'm all for being rational in critiques, but learning to encourage others is a skill I think we could improve upon.

  Since writers thrive on positive feedback, one way to do that is the "feedback sandwich." It's basically like this:

  State something you liked--"I read your story and really enjoyed the characterizations"

  State one thing you'd like to improve--"I don't like how things turned out with the main character"

  Restate something you liked "All in all, it's a good story, I just have a few questions about the ending."

  It might seem simple, but it goes a long way in showing respect to the author and the readers who enjoyed a story. It can also open up a dialogue that answers questions. I see a lot of people in the comments who don't want to tone down their use of criticism. Then don't--just remember to provide positive feedback also.

  I disagree with Holm's Maxim. If you go on Reddit to post about liking X, we should be able to discuss X and it's faults (which will most likely come across as trying to convince you of that, whether that's true or not). And I definitely don't see what's assholish about that. Quite the opposite: You might realize why X isn't as good as you thought, learn something and possibly even get recommendations for things better than X.

  Of course, you can post why you like X and then simply ignore the responses.

    >f you go on Reddit to post about liking X, we should be able to discuss X and it's faults

    If you read the original post carefully, there's nothing that contradicts this (see 3rd line of Holm's Maxim). What you want to avoid is making a person who enjoyed X feel bad about enjoying X.

    1. Taste is subjective. Maybe you like prose that is terse and direct. Maybe I don't. If I tell you you're wrong about enjoy terse prose because florid prose is clearly superior, I'm just "yucking your yum" by appealing to an arbitrary standard of taste.
    2. Even if something is "bad" under some objective metric, it might still have redeeming qualities. By telling me to feel bad for enjoying that thing because of its bad qualities, it undercuts my (rightful) enjoyment of its good qualities.
    3. Different people are at different points in their journey of taste development. You don't tell a 13 year old that they should feel bad for enjoying a McNugget more than a perfectly sliced serving of mackerel sashimi. Instead you acknowledge that perhaps for the stage of palate-development the person is in, the McNugget is perfectly fine.
    4. *Umwelts* are different. This is a rehash of point 1 in some ways, but it's a stronger statement because it means that some tastes are not malleable. If you lack some isoform of a taste receptor that I have, you might never develop a taste for cruciferous vegetables or the fiction of HP Lovecraft.

    Concrete example from my actual life.

      First of all I want to mention that I agree with your 1 - 4, and I'm definitely against telling people they're dumb (or else) for liking X. If that's all Holm's Maxim is stating then I agree, but that's not what it actually says.

      Let's repeat the last two lines:

      3) It's okay to say you liked or didn't like a thing.

      4) If, however, you try to convince someone who liked a thing that they shouldn't have, you're being a dick.

      The fourth line doesn't state anything about feelings, but even if we assume that to be its meaning, it doesn't contradict my argument. If anything it shows that the Maxim is logically inconsistent.

      > What you want to avoid is making a person who enjoyed X feel bad about enjoying X.

      You cannot know what makes people feel bad about enjoying X. Most people feel bad when you just state why you think X is bad (or what you didn't like, or that you didn't like it), so your version of the 4th line, and the resulting inability to voice your opinion, contradicts the 3rd line.
      ```

      - u/UncleWeyland:
        ```
        Fair, one nitpick.

        > Most people feel bad when you just state why you think X is bad (or what you didn't like, or that you didn't like it)

        I think that depends on how you say it. If you are directly or subtly impugning their taste or intellect, then yes. If instead you are diplomatic and highlight why that opinion is respectable, then maybe not.

        I think we can all agree that making people feel bad is bad, and that being able to have conversations about the relative quality of entertainment is good, the difficulty is to figure out the optimal point  where one is allowed to highlight potential improvements in something without massively stepping on the toes of someone else's enjoyment.

        It's made entirely more difficult by the fact that different people have different threshold for what they find to be uncomfortable. People with thick skin can be told that what they like is stupid, and they'll give you the finger and continue to unabashedly enjoy whatever it is they like. People with thin skin may not like it at all when even the slightest aspersion is cast towards the media they consume.

        It's all very complicated. So maybe the proposed blanket rule isn't that great. Fair fair fair.

          Agreed.

          Yeah, you can especially see this in any kind of fan subreddit. It's anecdotal evidence, but I've seen it quite a lot that considerate, well-versed criticism (even when combined with praise) tends to hover around zero upvotes or less.

          In general, I think the only way we can avoid the extreme negative reaction many people have is by somehow training people from a young age for a higher threshold (in a humane way), though that's obviously easier said than done.

  Geek hate has always been a thing, but it really feels as though, over the last few years, across a broad range of geekdom, geek self-hate has become a thing; as though some kind of line has been crossed from gentle self-mocking to unhealthy joking-but-not-really vitriol.

  For this specific forum, I have many issues with this particular policy as stated - I find the reasons why someone didn't like a thing super helpful when deciding whether I'm likely to enjoy the thing or not - but I do think there is a real underlying problem here. 

  I've certainly found myself producing rants about the feeling of unexpectedly negative statements making one realise that a space they thought of as safe and a people they thought of as ingroup are actually neither of those things recently, and I've seen an uptick of similar sentiment from others ([e.g.](https://www.somethingpositive.net/sp10172019.shtml)).

  I don't know if it's just a factor of the geekdoms/groups I am part of, or if it's something general. I also don't know what an actually sensible thing to do about it might look like, or even if I've done any better at articulating what seems to be the root issue than all the previous attempts. Still, putting it out there in case others have ideas.

  I find the existence of this post, and the subsequent general approval from other users, *extremely* surprising, since I've always viewed r/rational as *too* nice and *not elitist/harsh/gatekeeping enough*. Like, the sheer rarity of clear-cut, intentionally rational fiction (not to even speak about rationalist fiction) is so great that any community based upon enjoying it _must_ have higher standards or otherwise it will eventually either a) die off, or b) become flooded by stuff that is less and less plentiful in the 'rational' characteristics, eventually turning into just another vaguely 'dark/serious/""intelligent"" fiction' recommendation group. People really shame and sneer on gatekeeping (which, to be fair, is a bad thing much of the time), but I've also seen [this](https://i.imgur.com/sdOkUVr.jpg) happen *many* times before. And really, I would say that it's already kinda happening here.

  I agree with "let everyone enjoy whatever" completely and I can kinda get the "more members of X means more content that X likes", except that writing rational fiction is too difficult for that to scale in our favor and there are already many communities with stories with subtler rational elements (LitRPG, HFY, and so on), so there's no *need* to make r/rational more open if people are satisfied with those.

  What I mean to say is, I agree with the sentiment in the OP entirely, but I don't agree that it's universal; I don't see why it has to be enforced _here_ or in other highly-specific communities enjoying highly-specific types of content. If I posted this in r/youtubehaiku and said that videos *over* the length of 14 seconds are also fine and shouldn't be criticised (obviously true), wouldn't that be kinda missing the point?

    Does that comic seriously posit that one of the stages in the ruination of a hobby is "females" participating in it? And that "females" only participate in male-dominated hobbies to attract male attention? Gee, I sure hope I'm not ruining the sub with my ~vapid lady opinions~.

      Eh, if I remember correctly, it was made on 4chan; sexism and such is par for the course. Couldn't find anything better and it conceptualized the idea well enough; though I guess I could have just left it out entirely. Sorry if it bothered you.

        If you post a comic that includes a part about "females" ruining hobbies with their presence, and then say "what's in this comic is happening in this sub," it comes across like you're endorsing the sexism. Since that's not your intent, it might communicate your stance better in the future if you briefly described the idea you're going for in words rather than using the comic.

  >Credibly helpful criticism should be delivered in private.

  So if I and others disagree with or want to improve a post (including this one?) I should dm it instead?

  So the only comments on something are supportive?

  By your own post no one can comment publicly not supporting your position.

  Also this seems you assume re the enjoyment people get from making critical comments, being criticised and reading other criticisms. The absolute dearth of video essays which are almost attack pieces on certain media should demonstrate that a significant amount of people enjoy fixing up by way of removing the bad stuff not adding good stuff. So I don't see why you can sourcelessly state other people don't enjoy it around you. Any studies on net happiness? 

  If someone wants to post a deconstruction of Banks who is suffering there? Even if they're mean about the original are we meant to consider the possibility of fans being upset for someone being snide towards a work they like? I don't know if hpmor would have been as enjoyable if it was carefully stepping around every possible insult it could conceivably make. 

  Anyway even if we take what you say to be true it seems that the answer is zero criticism, not criticise in private. There can be no justification for negative comments if we assume the average writer is demotivated and suffers from them. Even if such a comment would improve the work who cares about the work quality of some fun writing over happiness? If that's the scenario we might as well do away with comments.

  Still there's little harm in being nice so sign every post with a heart. ♥

  IMHO the important thing is not to fall into that very common trend of implying that people who like something you don't are either stupid or immoral because of it. That is what really gets people pissed off, and for good reason, because it's really getting up and personal over something relatively trivial.

  I think criticism shouldn't be withheld too much. Too many communities of creatives just turn into self-congratulating bubbles where everyone just pats each other's back in the hope that they'll be patted in return when they do something. I get why that might be pleasant, but it's also kinda pointless and tends to inflate too much people's sense of their own ability - then as soon as they step out they're up for a bitter disappointment. So I'd rather people don't feel *too* worried about offending with their criticism, and the subjects of said criticism take it gracefully, than the opposite.

  I love all of this and it corresponds really well with my own feelings.  I especially like the part about negativity dealing SAN damage; I've definitely experienced that myself in multiple ways.  To pick the most relevant: sporking communities are honestly kind of terrifying, not because they're dangerous or anything, but because of what it does to the mentalities of the people in them.  I've gotten sucked into some before, not nearly as much as the more prolific users, but still enough to feel the negative sanity effects.    It's some kind of manifested evil, like a reverse lotus eater scenario where people continually eat a plant that drives them mad with paranoia and hate because they don't want to "forget" their "insight" that they're living in Hell and everyone else is stupid and worthless; they constantly look for more reasons to hate the things they've already found reasons to hate, and they constantly look for more things to throw on the hatred bonfire.  Be really careful of that self-congratulatory cynical feedback loop.

  Thank you for your post. I assume this is aimed at me. Your advice is meant in good spirits, but I respectfully say that following it would harm this subreddit more than it would help.

  Excellent post. I agree with most of it. By the way, it wasn't prompted by this comment I made, was it? Despite the fact that it got 12 upvotes and I tried to express it as tactfully as I could under the circumstances, a lot of this feels like it might be a response to me and to this comment in particular.

  The trouble is, what if the negativity is against negativity? I think it's reasonable to criticize a work for something like bigotry, for a few reasons: 

  1. Anyone who would be turned off by that really ought to know first, especially if it's targeted at them.

  2. This community is r/rational, and bigotry isn't rational thought (or at least we don't live in a world where bigotry has good evidence backing it, and any story set in such a world isn't going to teach any good lessons on the subject). We should treat it the same as if someone wrote a story with deeply religious undertones and no rationality on that subject.

  We should at least have content warnings, but I think the bot that brought up this controversy doesn't do a good job of that. And author content warnings are also useful, especially for an in-progress story. Death of the author in an absolute sense is impossible, the work is the thoughts of the author. It can be evaluated outside of that context, but if your goal is to predict if the story will make someone uncomfortable (and not in a useful way)...

  A content warning isn't a criticism so much as, you know, a warning.

  Also, what's with all the justifying transphobia with [cultural relativism?](https://preview.redd.it/bbjghma4mhy31.jpg?width=638&auto=webp&s=538be4430619cd0e71f5ce36a43affe4cef7ae01) Just, **no**. Someone's right to exist trumps someone else's right to be uncomfortable. Just because slavery/racism/whatever is commonplace doesn't mean it's okay. In fact it makes it *worse*. Reminds me of that scene in the Yudkowsky story where someone tries that to justify the baby eating aliens and gets a slap, if I'm remembering that right.

  EDIT: Thanks for the silver.
