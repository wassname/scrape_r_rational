## [HSF][EDU][MK][TH] The Hyperbolic Time Chamber as Brain Emulation Analogy: "Ignoring the DBZ-specific aspects of the HTC one wonders: what one would do with a HTC in the real world? A whole time-accelerated pocket universe… Surely we can think of something less pointless than tweaking athletics?"

  In universe, they could've set up a senzu bean farm since they take a long time to grow.

    They do set up a senzu bean farm in the Dragonball Multiverse U16 fanfiction. However they don't do that in the HTC because they need many more; they just grab a whole uninhabited planet and cultivate it. It's a necessity because in that universe Vegitto is permanently fused and senzu beans are the only thing energetic enough to keep him fed.

  Startups are going to love this. Also hate this. It allows them to trade effort that large companies won't be able to spare (because most employees won't sit in a box for a year) for time-to-market, and helps devoted newcomers displace incumbents.

  I expect automated manufacturing will be all over this. Some expensive processes should become a lot more effective, since it makes small-scale production much faster. It requires a lot of space, though.

  The major targets might be mostly related to ramp-up time. It's much easier to make one machine, or train one person, and then speed them up 365x, than to make 365 machines or train 365 people.

  Still thinking, though. I suspect this would change a lot, but it's not clear where the lowest hanging fruit is.

  - u/Veedrac:
    ```
    This will play a major role in hardware verification. You are generally time constrained, yet unable to ramp up production on pre-production samples. Being able to do exhaustive testing runs in 24h would be extremely useful.

    This might let companies research long-term effects on biological systems without long-term studies, assuming things can be automated. This could improve certain parts of healthcare.

      Also pharmaceutical testing!  


      Also, depending on how the legalities of it work, there would probably be companies who try to pay employees normal-time-rates, rather than their subjective-time-rates. If this isn't possible, they'll likely use the chambers to train 'un-payed interns' before hiring them.

      It doesn't. Brute forcing encryption is easily parallelizable, and if it was practical to break encryption keys by using a few hundred times more computers then it would already be done given the extreme value you could get from doing so.

  The Haber process for nitrogen fixation is very slow when not done at high pressures and temperatures. If a device could be made to perform a high efficiency, low speed Haber process without human intervention, fertilizer and other nitrogen dependent products could be cheaper. I don't know how it would be powered, but I'm sure something could be arranged. It doesn't really matter if the machine can't run for the full year; it just needs to make enough to justify the cost of the machine regardless of wasted time.

  You could probably grow some really cool crystals that would take impractically long times IRL, but I doubt this would be particularly valuable.

  Maybe you could bioengineer microorganisms to eat plastics if you put a bunch of plastic in there as a potential source of food. Kind of doubt it though.

  Maybe test how corrosion resistant certain alloys or paints make a material? Seems a bit niche.

    I am constantly impressed that humanity uses 3% of its whole energy consumption on fertilizer aka Haber process.

    - u/sicutumbo:
      ```
      Just the Wikipedia article on it is really cool. It quadrupled Earth's food production with the additional fertilizer it offered. Half the nitrogen in your body was fixed through the Haber process.

    hbt's can also increase gravity and heat if I remember correctly so maybe it would help with that too.

    > Electricity is the dominant cost of computing power these days, so a HTC must save on electricity or justify its cost premium. Instead of throwing one really expensive HTC server at the problem for a year, throw 365 cheap power-efficient servers at it for a day as many tech companies are able to do, or just run it on a cloud computing platform.

    Same deal here.

      Plus mining Bitcoin requires an internet connection (since that's how blockchain technology works).
      ```

      - u/Gr_Cheese:
        ```
        As far as I know, this is not necessarily true for Bitcoin. In current practice, yes, miners need an active internet connection, because the guy next to them might solve for a block and it would normally be in their best interest to solve on top of that new block instead of 'continuing' on their own. (And they only know about that solved block from their internet connection.)

        The solving part doesn't require an internet connection, just an up to date blockchain and some pending transactions. The propagating part is the internet part. Since we can safely assume that the time chamber solves first, there's no issue as long as they can pop open the door every couple of minutes to communicate with the rest of the world.

        Blocks take an average of 10 minutes (real world time?) independent of total computational power in the mining pool. So for starters that 'real-world time?' bit is going to have to be addressed. Also whether or not there are multiple time chambers... Honestly, at this point in a rational world, someone smarter than me would probably come along with an Altcoin to account for these problems. But Bitcoin's system, as is, could function inside a time chamber; it could functionally be the same as a massive increase in hash rate... that involves opening a door every couple of minutes.

        EDIT: Was it a DBZ rule that the chamber only opens once a day real world time? If the door can't be opened as frequently as the avaerage block publication rate, then it's useless for Bitcoin. And thank god for that, a hash rate arms race is not a good use of the world's resources.

          I don't remember anything like that. When Goten and Trunks go in to train before fighting Majin Bu, the door is re-opened one hour later. The rule was that a single human can't spend more than 48 real time hours inside. It was violated later anyway, so we can probably just ignore it.

    Yeah, I think fermented foods would be the biggest use. Wine, whiskey, tobasco, miso, cheese, etc. Basically no set up cost, since you just throw stuff in and open it up again in a day.

  I dunno what I’d use the article’s hyperbolic time chamber for besides aging food, but the canon one can be exited at will (Goten and Trunks pre buu fight, Kid Goku taking a month and then leaving, iirc vegeta blew something critical up and had to leave early once). As such, it’d be a lot more useful for time critical tasks; need to get a response to an event? Have your pr people spend a week inside perfecting a speech, then have it ready to go within 10 minutes. Want to finish touching up a project or prototype before a deadline? Need to get your patch working before customers start seriously complaining?

  I think the article crippled itself by adding that kinda arbitrary restriction on.

  Cheat your way to faster processor speeds by sequestering all your computing hardware inside to make brute force a feasible solution for hard-to-solve problems.
  ```

  - u/sicutumbo:
    ```
    I don't think it would be much of an advantage. Brute forcing is parellelizable, so distributed computing would be more practical than powering a computer for a year with no human input. For problems like brute forcing encryption, a 365 factor speed increase wouldn't be significant enough to matter.

  Shove your dev team in to meet deadlines. It's no less humane than the other shit some push.

  Khonsu used HTCs as pretty devastating weapons.

  Frankly, if I had one I would likely use it to take long weekends where I didn't have to talk to anyone or do anything. maybe just sleep in there so I didn't have to worry about being late for things.

  Why is software development considered zero sum here? If the Android developers spent a day there writing bug fixes, then Android users will have a smoother experience for one year, compared to the normal schedule.

  And not only bug fixes, but I can think of a lot of software development tasks that can be done more or less in isolation, specially design ones. Imagine a new programming language, database engine, or file system developed in six real-time months by baton-passing developers using the HTC.

  I would happily eat dehydrated food and live in isolation for a year to make this happen.
  ```

  - u/GeneralExtension:
    ```
    I think people using it for smaller increments would be more popular. Also, if a lot of people are doing it, growing food in them as well could mean a lot of fresh produce. The people who use them get to eat fresh food for (part of?) a year, and everyone else enjoys having stuff out of season (that's actually in season).
