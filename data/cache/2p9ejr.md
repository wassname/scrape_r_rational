## The Martian by Andy Weir [HSF]

### Post:

This is a new hard sci-fi novel that I think you might enjoy. A plot is fairly simple. The story takes place in the not-very-distant future. An astronaut gets accidentally left behind on Mars and has to survive on minimal resources for a really long time until help arrives. Every now and then something goes disastrously wrong and the hero has to get really, really creative in order to not die. Meanwhile on Earth, people of NASA have to get really, really creative in order to figure out how to save him.

A book like that could easily become pretty gloomy, but the tone is actually lighthearted/humorous despite lots of tense moments. There's a strong competence porn feeling to the story that I think MoR readers might like. The author went to insane lengths to make sure that all the technology and science is as accurate as it can be. All in all, it reads like an Arthur Clarke novel written in modern colloquial language with some geeky references thrown in.

  Cannot recommend this enough.  I got it about a year ago and said to myself "I'll read a few pages while I'm having lunch."  Next thing I know I've finished the book and am having to figure out how I lost an entire workday!  (Fortunately I worked from home so it wasn't immediately obvious and I could make it up.)

    Wait, what, seriously? That's awesome! It's a joke, right?

      No, it's true. There's going to be a big-budget movie. 
      It may get stuck in development hell but at least it is *planned*.

        Planned for less than a year from now, so it's pretty late to kill it.  Hopefully that's good.

        Also, before Andy Weir was an author he was a webcomic artist, creator of [Casey and Andy](http://www.galactanet.com/comic/view.php?strip=1) and totally not [Home on the Strange](http://www.homeonthestrange.com/view.php?ID=1) the way I originally wrote, although that is a very good strip.

        Damnit.

  Great book. The only thing I was able to find wrong with it was a part where he had to drop some voltage using resistors. While this works well for low wattage applications, he was trying to drop the voltage on something running multiple amps. That would have blown all but mulch-hundred watt resistors.

  Other than that one goof that only an EE would notice, the book seemed to be very accurate to reality. Would highly recommend.

  I recommend reading his other stories ([on his site for free](http://www.galactanet.com/writing.html)) as well

  And this is what we mean when we say that the dark side has cookies.

  Oh man, I remember reading this back when it was free on the web. I really enjoyed it, though the ending was a bit weak in my opinion. I was a bit dubious when my friends told me that there was pretty much only one character, but his personality more than makes up for that.
