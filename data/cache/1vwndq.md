  Not sure it's especially *rational*, but it's interesting and well executed.

    Yeah. I'm sort of scraping the bottom of the barrel. There are some well received rationalfics that I don't really like. I should probably post them.

      When a subreddit isn't super active, it's fine to post less relevant things. However, I do think you should only post the ones you like.
      If you decide to stop posting things like this here, please post them to /r/hpfanfiction.

      I agree that it is basically just generic HP fanfic - though it is interesting to see that esama has started posting again, as I had thought he was out for good when he deleted his fanfiction.net profile and stories.
