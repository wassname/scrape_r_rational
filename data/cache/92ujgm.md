## For those of you who are into Self Insert Fanfiction, what are some well written ones?

### Post:

There are many self inserts out there but there are not many, what I consider, well written ones. Most self inserts have a tendency to delve into wish fulfillment, harems, and fix-it sues. Those types of self inserts are trash solely for the reason it is simply unrealistic.

Think about it. Let’s say you were reincarnated/transmigrated to a foreign universe with untamed powers that you have no idea to control. What is the first thing you would do? Have fun exploring and try out your new magical powers? Plan on meeting and befriending the canon characters? Save someone that you know is going to die if you won’t do anything? All wrong.

The first thing and only thing I will do is survive. A self insert that focuses on doing anything to survive is a well written self insert.I don’t to read self inserts that focuses on trying to fix everything in their limited means. Leave that to the canon characters. I want a self insert that does anything it takes to survive because that makes the story more realistic and rational. Human beings are selfish enough to prioritize their survival over others. On the other hand Saints are the ones with Anime’s about them.

With that being said in order to survive you need power. But this is not a universe like the one you watched in an anime. This is a real rational universe that has its own laws and rules. I dont expect a self insert born into the naruto universe to instantly be 
a master in chakra like hes some sort of genius in par with itachi. Lets face it. You were average in real life. You are still average reborn into another universe.

But knowledge is another type of power which you have plenty of. You are a god of knowledge. Omniscient knowledge of the past, present, and future. With that knowledge the self insert can work harder and earlier than others dabbleing in munchkinry in order to achieve power rationally. But be warned. The minute you stepped into this universe you know so much of, canon is out the window. The butterfly effect is in motion and every action you take obscures everything you know of the future.

A good self insert also keeps power levels in check. In a realistic and rational Self insert, the SI starts out weak and progressively gets strong. There should always be someone or something stronger than the self insert. A stronger power to threaten the self insert. A stronger power that the self insert can strive for. If that is not true the self insert is basically a god and their godhood was either obtained through many chapters of trials and tribulations or the story you are reading is wish fulfillment trash that has no respect to the universe they are writing about.

It is hard to find well written self inserts, especially male self inserts. Here are the ones that I highly recommend and I hope you can suggest me your findings of well written self inserts as well.

  This use of the term 'self insert' is interesting to me, as a anime and manga consumer I have heard the phrase used very differently. In that community a 'self-insert character' is a character that is a blank slate, one that has little to no personality so that the consumer can project on to them, or is given a specific personality to appeal to a certain demographic. In this community it seems that the term means an author inserting themselves into the story as a character, or just inserting a character from our world into a fictional one (Worth the Candle and metaworld chronicles seem to be 'self insert' fiction), whereas in the anime community this genre is better known as 'Isekai' a Japanese term that means 'different world' or 'another world', it is interesting to see this difference in two forms of culture that likely mix often (through fanfiction sites and Reddit among other social media).

    As another anime and manga consumer, I find this baffling in its entirety. The term has been widely used as OP has used it among the anime fanfiction community, without clarification, for at least the last seventeen years. (Longer than that, I'm pretty sure, but I've only found documented use as far back as [early 2001](http://jusenkyo.wikia.com/wiki/Insertion_(D%27anna\)).)

    What you describe as your referent for that term, I — and I think I would go so far as to say _we_ — know as an [everyman protagonist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everyman).

    > In this community it seems that the term means an author inserting themselves into the story as a character, or just inserting a character from our world into a fictional one

    I think, even here^(1), it only properly means the former. _Worth the Candle_ qualifies as an SI if the author has admitted to Juniper Smith being a thinly veiled expy of himself — which he may or may not have done; the matter escapes me as irrelevant — but it's SI**-adjacent** regardless; people who enjoy well-written self-insertions are likely to enjoy it.

    > whereas in the anime community this genre is better known as 'Isekai' a Japanese term that means 'different world' or 'another world'

    This, conversely, only means the latter. Contrast the [_Chronicles of Thomas Covenant_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chronicles_of_Thomas_Covenant), which are a published _isekai_ series whose inserted character is decidedly _not_ an author-insert of any stripe; it is not, to my knowledge, called a "self-insertion" by anyone. Contrast also an old fad in Ranma ½ fanfiction wherein a self-insert character (thus called!) would come to Nerima as an "exchange student"; these predated common use of the term "_isekai_", but would not be called that even retrospectively.

    I'd second this one. I knew one of the source series ("Is it wrong to try to pick up girls in a dungeon?"), but not the other ("My youth romantic comedy is wrong, as expected"). I felt like I missed a lot of the protagonist's internal referencesearly on and it took a good while to get used to how he thinks to himself, but I was pleased to find that not only is there a narrative reason for how he behaves, it also shows what happens when he can't deal with his life or issues and breaks. The protagonist is OP, but not invincible, and a lot of his issues stem from his incompatible wishes to both return to the real world, and to stay in the isekai world and keep his new friends safe and successful. The fic is complete, but it doesn't resolve the main plot; it very much ends in a way that leaves space for a follow-up.

  - u/Ih8Otakus:
    ```
    I loved dreaming of sunshine because it got me into self insert fanfiction and it was going on really strong until the SI tried to play fix-it by warning gaara the akatsuki was after him. Did no one question her, a mere genin, of where did she get that information? Did gaara not tell anyone himself that an s-class threat was after him? In a rational naruto universe this would not fly but that didnt stop me from reading. What stopped me was how most chapters were based off filler naruto episodes. I skipped naruto filler episodes because I personally hate filler and I dont really want to,god forbid, READ about filler rather than watch it.

    Other than my whiny nitpicks its pretty good starter self insert if you like naruto fanfiction.
    ```

    - u/Flashbunny:
      ```
      It's been a while, but I seem to recall her specifically waiting until she'd actually obtained the information in-universe to pass on before she did so, for exactly that reason. It was one of her major long-term goals. Am I misremembering?
      ```

      - u/Ih8Otakus:
        ```
        No. She badically went full fix-it and droped the bomb on genin gaara. Maybe later she obtains this mindset. I did not read further.
        ```

        - u/Flashbunny:
          ```
          So, I went and found the specific conversation. The thing is, I don't really see it as a major problem. They weren't around anyone else, and she didn't have any of the problems telling Gaara that she would telling a Leaf ninja - the exact problems you bring up. 

          Why would she have to justify where she got the knowledge to Gaara? Sure she's just a genin, but he has no idea what she might have picked up elsewhere, and no reason to press her - she's a foreign ninja doing him a huge favour. He has no reason to tell anyone in Suna where he got this information from either - why would he risk trouble for this person he owes a great deal, that he bonds to in the very same scene? From a purely selfish standpoint, why would he risk this informant who's apparently bringing him S-rank information?

          I can, however, see why you dropped it for following all the stations of canon religiously including the filler. I would note that the quality of the "filler" arcs isn't any less here - unlike in the anime, it's the same writer for all of this fic, not some lesser writers making stuff up for the filler - but just following the rails is too much for some people. It doesn't bother me nearly so much because I never watched the anime, so it doesn't really come across as filler so much.
          ```

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    I actually just came across this in the past few days and caught up.

    It doesn't really have much to do with rationality. The SI is rather OP, frequently beating opponents that should by rights trounce her, and this is partially but not fully excused by being a reincarnate and thus more mature than your average child soldier. Also, it follows the stations of canon rather too strongly, to the point of sometimes seeming implausible.

    That said, I did enjoy reading it, but not as a rational story; rather, it's more of a worldbuilding exercise, exploring what a character in the Naruto world, with a sprinkling of metaknowledge, could do. Marked as a follow, but not a favorite.
    ```

    - u/vorpal_potato:
      ```
      I love DoS, but at this point it feels like the characters in it are being deliberately blind to how implausible their luck is. I mean, they've definitely *noticed,* but they just don't think about it. It's the kind of story where, much like canon, a handful of characters always run into interesting main-plotline situations and come out on top even when they ought to have been completely outclassed. It's a story where, like the sort-of-canon anime fillers, you could run into some wacky group of noodle ninjas who have no reason to exist and are never spoken of again. There is no way in hell that any of this is a coincidence and in a more rational fanfic *that would be a much bigger deal.*

  > The first thing and only thing I will do is survive.

  That makes sense, just make sure you don't knock things off the rails and destroy the world or something. I'm not familiar with Naruto, which you seem to prefer, but the two backgrounds I'm most familiar with, Harry Potter and Worm, butterflying the story at all is likely to lead to Bad Things.

  So survival doesn't necessarily mean power, in those stories it means getting the heck outta Dodge and avoiding interacting with anyone in the story. If you can move to Australia and get an innocuous job where you don't matter to anyone outside Black Stump Corners, do it.

  **[Wearing Robert's Crown](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/wearing-roberts-crown-asoiaf-si.382035/)** is a well-written self-insert fic in the ASoIaF setting. And it uses one of the better approaches to self-inserts that I've come across - telling the story from the viewpoint of the other characters. 

  Self-insert fiction has a tendency to get bogged down in what the insert is *thinking* rather than what they're *doing*, when the latter is generally the more interesting part of the story. Third-party perspective goes a long way to fixing that.

  I found this Dragon Age self-insert to be entertaining. The character enters the video game world from our reality, but has no prior knowledge of the game world when she arrives. IIRC they play it off like a parallel universe with no mention of it being a video game in her home universe.

  Despite knowing nothing of the world she's arrived in, she does get swept up in the game plot.

    A heads-up for anyone else looking to read these, they seem to focus excessively on sex - 5 chapters in there's an explicit sex scene, and no signs that's not going to be the norm. It doesn't really add anything to the story, either.

    - u/hikahia:

      I mean, sure, it's got sex scenes in it, but it's not a PWP by any means. It's meant to be a humorous story, and she spends the whole first chapter believing she's in the middle of a sex dream, what'd you expect?
      ```

      - u/Flashbunny:
        ```
        It seems excessively focused on it. The whole scene built around the somewhat raunchy joke that she thinks it's a sex dream? Sure. The whole story continuously coming back to sex in some way for the first, what 8 or so chapters before I stopped reading? No thanks. Like I said, it doesn't add anything unless you're looking for lewd stuff - it just gets in the way.

        Like, we have the first chapter being an extended joke about a sex dream, then mages are apparently all wear robes so they can have sex quickly, there's a lot of discussion about how Earth sexual norms are different from this setting's, then she's having sex with one of the mages, then she's fending off advances from the king... and it looks like it's going to keep going. If you're looking for a sex-focused story I'm sure it's great, but I'm really not.

It's the same reason people like [Harry Potter and the Natural 20](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20). It's not strictly rational, but it's entertaining.

        As to the science, which parts in particular did you think were bad?  It's been a while since I wrote it, and the only specifically science-based thing I can think of offhand was the steam cannons.  I did a lot of math before writing that section to convince myself that it worked, but it was later pointed out to me that I got it wrong.  I patched the idea by saying that Loki had caused a very quiet miracle in order to make them work, as part of his effort to help keep his catspaw (Jake) in power.  I even had Loki explicitly call out the mistake in the text, and then he got annoyed with Jake and said he would stop making them work, so Jake replaced the steam cannons with a magical solution based on Shrink Object.

        (Oh, wait, there was another math error:  I miscalculated how big the explosion would be when Isaac used Polymorph Any Object to create antimatter.  I had it as something like 6kg when it should have been 6g.  I promptly fixed that with a quick revision.)

  [Life Ore Death](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/life-ore-death-dc-feruchemy-young-justice.35443/) is a great quasi-self-insert. It handles as a typical self-insert, but avoids all the typical downsides by making the insert an OC.

  MC is Renka, a Feruchemist from the Mistborn Triology. It starts after said triology, so it contains a lot of spoilers. Even the beginning may be considered a spoiler, so I’ll keep it vague beyond there being in-universe reasons for how it happens. Young Justice side is very similar to With This Ring/Assimilation etc, where she becomes a member of the team and they do missions together.

  What I especially like are the character interactions and the reasoning behind how things unfold. The reason for the typical adult insert to team up with the teenagers is often very flimsy, but it is quite nice here. Renka’s influence also feels more natural than the typical meta-knowledge influenced hypercompetence or "solving" of plot-hole related issues. She is also not as game-breakingly overpowered as others are, but actually part of the team.

  I just realized you put this in your own recommendations list. On Reddit, just a straight newline is equivalent to hitting space. You need to add two newlines to make a new paragraph or make it bulleted list the following.

  Also, in terms of the other recs, I like WTR the most and find it the most rational. I would totally also like some other rational SI (or even just good SI).

  I've been writing a series of rational scifi novelettes where the protagonist of part 1 is a self insert.  


  Note: to write self-inserts well, you must:

  1. have a realistic understanding of your own flaws
  2. give the self-insert character challenges that are actually hard for them. (aka, the rule still applies that if you give Frodo a lightsaber you must give Sauron the deathstar.)
  3. Your self insert MUST diverge from you over the course of the story because they are gaining life experiences that you are not, and vice versa.

The protagonist is a corpse Tinker called Fossil, and his trigger conditions are taken from an actual experience the author had. It also, for a Worm-derived thing, qualifies as lighthearted comedy. Even during Endbringer fights.

  Youjo Senki / A Young Woman’s Military Record is a great, well, not quite self insert but still a modern person isekai that avoids almost all of the failings of the genre. It’s not rational, but I would definitally consider it rational adjacent? I especially liked how the MC didn’t end up beleiving Being X’s tripe.
  It also has one really good fanfic once you’ve seen the original, which is an SI in the same vein as the Og story: https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13002064/1/A-Young-Woman-s-Political-Record

  Amazing Nasuverse / FSN SIish Quest by fallacies; it’s a quest in which the readers vote on the actions of a Isekai into F/SN. All the mechanics are accurate to canon (no bad fanon here), and in addition to being one of the best nasu gurus fallacies is a talented writer. Great if you enjoy any of Nasus work, but seems to be on hiatus for now.

  Two good naruto SIs.


  There’s also just isekai / Isekai Tensai as a genre, which is sorta what your talking about, but almost all isekai are, well, bad.
  Aside from Youjo Senki, the only two I can unironically reccomend are Overlord and Konosuba, but even those aren’t *great*. Overlord is “What if your standard bad isekai was written by an excellent author,” and Konosuba is “What if we were aware that yes, this kind of isekai is trash, and played it for laughs;” Its not any more rational than standard isekai, but it doesnt try to pretend it is or take itself seriously which makes it much better than normal.


  There was also one Attack on Titan SI I liked, but I can’t seem to find it, and 2 year emperor, which is linked elsewhere on this page.

      I don't really counts as a failing of the genre (I have opinions :rm: on it as a point in general, but that's not really relevant so I'll be avoiding that). At worst, it's a failing of japanese media in general, and isn't a standard part of the usual garbage isekai. What I'm referring to is:

      The reason for transportation. In most isekai, this is either handwaved entirely, or happens as a result of a godlike being that appears out of nowhere and we never see again, usually with no real reason for their actions. Youjo Senki has neither.

      The implausible, nonsensical world the protagonist is isekaid into. Take a look at, I dunno death march rhapsody or whatever; the world they enter is unfailingly a giant mess of plot convenience. In Youjo Senki, The author put a lot of effort. If you take a look at his "works cited" and suggested historical info, he put a lot of work into making a time appropriate political scene, and it really shows (So does his status as a victoria 2 fan, but honestly paradox games are pretty good about that whole thing as well).

      An interesting setting. Most isekai are very, very bland power fantasies. Even without all the work the author put into their setting, having it in 20th century not!europe is already a huge improvement. 

      Characters having intelligence that matches their described intelligence. Unlike the standard isekai, Tanya's intelligence is a shown trait rather than just informed, and  better yet this "actual intelligence" isn't limited to her either

      -Adding on to this, as a character she's not bland black haired mc #1256, which can end my interest in a work so fastfart.
