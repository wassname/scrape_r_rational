  Any word on Game of Champions ever coming back? Really enjoyed this one, want to see it concluded.

    As I recall, the author is in the military and doesn't really have the time to work on it. I don't think it's canceled, just on indefinite hiatus.

    Interestingly (but only a little), a very similar situation occured with a very similar fan work - Landwalker's Yellow Nuzlocke.

      Seeing both of those go unfinished hurts a bit.
      ```

      He sometimes posts updates on the dark Lord Potter thread, but the last one was in November or something

    Are these the stories mentioned?

    Out of curiosity, are you not a fan of Origin of Species? If not, I'd love some feedback :)

    Agreed.  I've read Sun Soul, Pedestal, and Traveller, and am currently reading Triumvirate and rereading Traveler.

    There's also [Pokemon: The Origin of Species](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9794740/1/Pokemon-The-Origin-of-Species) and [Pokemon: The Line](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11273833/1/Pok%C3%A9mon-The-Line), both rational interpretations of the Pokemon world, with Origin of Species being the largest so far.

    I can also recommend [Symbiosis](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7917071/1/Symbiosis), which has a similar understanding of the Pokemon world as not all sunshine and roses without delving into grimderp.  The author recently announced that he's going to rewrite it under a new name after a year or two of planning, but that's not to say that what he's made so far isn't good.

    I liked Pokemon 0 as well, although it's shorter and not quite as good as GoC or Pedestal. I never really got into Sun Soul, is it worth another shot?
    ```

- u/despicablenewb:
  ```
  Game of Champions remains one of my favorite stories ever, up there with Rothfuss and Butcher. 

  I know I'm resurrecting a dead thread, but it came up on my scheduled search for more of Lamora's content. 

  Origin of species is great, if you're turned off by the premise, it's not preachy or full of itself as you're probably thinking. 

  I realize I'm posting in a fanfic thread on r/rational, but obviously HPMOR is amazing as well.
