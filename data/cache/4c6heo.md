## [RST] Group reading of the Sequences

### Post:

The LW survey got me thinking, and one of the things I'm ho-humm about with LW is that I always want to start discussing the sequence I just read, but there's no-one to do it with...

Would people be up for a periodic read-and-yak on the Sequences? Something roughly bi-weekly, but flexible depending on discussion level?

  If there was a weekly post, I'd be more likely to read the sequence and discuss it.
  ```

  - u/gommm:
    ```
    Same here, I'd definitely read a weekly post from the sequence and comment on it.
    ```

  - u/Atilme:
    ```
    I'd be up for that. I could start over, 'specially if it meant getting through all of it.
    ```

  /r/VoluntaristLWbookclub used to be kind of like that, but everyone lost attention pretty quick. We should probably remove it from the sidebar.

  Just a slightly off-topic question, but does anyone know if there's any posts that /u/EliezerYudkowsky wrote which *isn't* included in *Rationality: From AI to Zombies*?
  ```

  - u/Muyyd:
    ```
    May be 100. For example, most of "The Fun Theory" and a lot from "Metaethics" was not inclused.
    ```

    - u/EliezerYudkowsky:
      ```
      Quantum Normality was also pretty eviscerated.
      ```

      - u/_immute_:
        ```
        How was it decided what to include and what to exclude?
        ```

        - u/EliezerYudkowsky:
          ```
          Rob Bensinger decided.
          ```

          - u/_immute_:
            ```
            Well yes.

            I meant, on what basis? (or were you not very involved?)
            ```

  Neat! Ok, sounds like there's interest in a weekly something. I can try to make that happen. The next question would be....

  What usually keeps your interest?
  What usually loses it?

  The goal here, for me at least, isn't to have a good discussion, it's to *get through the sequences*. Discussion help with that. To that end, here's an idea:

  OP should be a summary, then: a thing I don't understand and would like someone to explain, a thing I do understand and think I can explain, what you have to look forward to next week.
  ```

- u/callmebrotherg:
  ```
  I'd definitely be up for that.
  ```
