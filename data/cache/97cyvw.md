## Aeromancer Info Released

### Post:

Hi all! Cultist Gelifyal here! Some people have requested that I release info regarding the rest of the story, which I have no problem doing (and perhaps world building stuff at a later date if that's desired).

To clarify something quick though, this isn't an AMA! I may or may not respond to people's questions. I ultimately decided to do this since I decided to place a higher priority on a different aspect of my life. And no, no one asked me to do this.

Firstly, I'm going to give out what I have written up until this point (which is up to chapter 18, though that chapter itself is not completed). This introduces new aspects of the world so if anyone does actually decide to continue writing the story, you'll have some idea of what thing's are like.

Please note that chapter 16-18 is of less quality because my beta readier/editor from this subreddit hasn't touched it yet, and he's the one who points out plot holes and what's "too convenient" for the MC. He's also the reason why my writing quality "went up" lol, so huge props to him!

And for the plotline to show where this was going in its entirety, I've decided to link this [doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zOEdis_-tq0Xd04eWMd8ZEukyB62e0dLePtFVMK_GRE/edit?usp=sharing).

Had I known that people were going to like it as much as they did, I would've started writing much earlier lol. In any case, writing takes *a lot* of free time, which I simply don't have anymore. I'm sorry for stringing everyone along, but hope you enjoyed what was made. Cheers!

  Since it seems like you're making a big life change here and this is, after all, the rational subreddit, I feel obligated to suggest you remember to take a rational perspective towards this intervention.

  Make sure you keep careful account of whether it's actually working and how effective it is. I've seen a lot of people make certain life interventions for a variety of different reasons, and they're all usually pretty hyped on the momentum of it at first and very satisfied with their decision, but after that inevitably wears off, two common failure modes present themselves:

  1. They couldn't stick with the change for discipline reasons
  2. They do stick with it, but it didn't actually turn out to be better than what they were doing before

  Your scenario seems unlikely to fall into case #1, but try to carefully track whether #2 ends up being the case once you get past the honeymoon period. The main reason I bring this up is because I've almost never seen someone end up happier after giving up one of their passions for something "more important". Sometimes it's necessary, such as dealing with mental health issues or freeing up time to spend with your family or because of changes in your employment situation, etc. But the resulting decrease in life satisfaction from giving up a passion is something that's hard to predict, let alone quantify, before you actually do it. Sometimes it's worth it to cut other areas of your life in order to make sure that you can continue with your passion, even if it's in a diminished form.

  What does this mean in practice? I'd recommend keeping a quick and easy log of your daily happiness and satisfaction with your life. Maybe just a 1-10 score and a quick pros/cons list. Shouldn't take more than 5 minutes a day. Ideally you would have started *before* this change so you'd have something to compare with, but it can still be helpful for analyzing the change rationally once your honeymoon period wears off. 

  If it turns out that you're not actually happier with the change you made once a few months pass and this is supported by the data in your log, then make another change to fix it, whether that's undoing the previous intervention or making adjustments to it to fix any problems that the previous change introduced.

  Hope this was helpful.

  And FYI: I am *not* one of your readers, so you can take this post to be entirely free from the "i want to keep reading your story" bias. :)

  Some of you might remember me from yesterday where I shared [copies](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/972fh9/aeromancer_update/e45buvl) of Aeromancer in various formats.

  Well...I made all new copies that include chapters 15 to 18 and the plotline notes as a 19th chapter. Making all of the formatting consistent from chapter to chapter was so problematic that I even uploaded the four chapters to FictionPress just to make sure that I had the right font! Don't worry I deleted the story afterwards, so there's no plagiarism.

  sad to see you go, but from your clear lucidity and good humor about the backlash you have faced for this specific choice, I feel much better about your safety. cults are no joke, and significant/sudden bursts of faith are often indistinguishable from them.

  I hope everything goes well for you regarding this (still quite surprising) choice, and thank you for revealing what you had planned in order to assist anyone who may want to continue where you left off.

- u/causalchain:

  Congratulations on making a tough decision! I am impressed that you have identified your values and have chosen to pursue them in spite of temptations otherwise. Most of the people on this sub (myself included) have a completely different set of values and a lot of people are insensitive to your beliefs (I'm so sorry you had to deal with some of the comments you've received). Thank you for sharing a slice of your imagination, and indeed a slice of your history if we follow the development of your story to your younger years. A lot of people have said this, but I want to say this myself: we all appreciate that you have taken the time out of your life to create something we enjoy!

  - u/RMcD94:
    ```
    I don't know that people should be sensitive to others beliefs just because they have them... That doesn't seem like a very rational position. Beliefs should be evaluated independently and I can see why people would be "insensitive" to beliefs that demonise and marginalise them.
    ```

    - u/causalchain:
      ```
      I think we are working off different sets of information. It was to my understanding that Gelifyal's beliefs (Christianity) don't demonise or marginalise rationality or any common culture of our group. I found many of the comments on the other post on this sub and on royalroad to be insensitive in that they were completely ignorant, yet rather assertive. I want to say that I won't pick on examples but what the heck, I'm totally going to pick on examples.

      >I hope he escapes whatever cult brainwashed him, and does so before they ruin his life too thoroughly.

      It's like the commenter assumes they know exactly what's going wrong, and that their opinion of OP's decision is just \*shake your head and smile sadly, this one is lost to us forever\*. They stopped treating him as a thinking human and immediately started modelling him one level below them. This isn't useful, this isn't rational and this isn't smart. And yet almost every comment acted like this.   


      I'm using 'sensitive' to describe a way of talking kindly and with respect whether you agree with them or not. It doesn't hinder rational thought at all and it makes it easier to communicate since people don't get offended and don't need to act defensively.  
      If i'm missing some information though, I'd like to know your opinions and why you felt the way you did. I appreciate your willingness to broach the subject.

        Well nothing that holds across our entire group apart from the anti-empiricism that comes with making non-falsifiable claims. 

        I was more talking about the attitude of his book to individuals which /r/rational community has no issue with, like homosexuality, or their lack of willingness to murder infants when murdering children means they get infinite bliss and not murdering means they have a chance of being infinitely tortured.

        Sure I don't agree with that comment. People willingly sign up to nazisim, the KKK, or WBC and to take away their moral responsibility for their actions isn't valuable. 

        >

        Respect is earned not given freely. I don't have an issue with people being dismissive or even antagonistic to groups that have often do the same.

        >It doesn't hinder rational thought at all and it makes it easier to communicate since people don't get offended and don't need to act defensively.

        I agree with this in principle, a marketplace of free ideas should result in the best ideas coming to the surface. In reality tolerance of ideas leads to their acceptance regardless of their merit. I think that ridicule can limit the attraction of positions to many people, of course what is ridiculed has nothing to do with what is right too, see for example the ridicule of socialism in the USA during the red scare, but it worked.

          I have a potential source for our disagreement, but correct me if I'm mistaken. You and probably many of the commenters from yesterday have an issue with the ideas that Gelifyal represents, whereas my opinions on him are based only on his words and actions as an individual.

          >I was more talking about the attitude of his book to individuals which [/r/rational](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational) community has no issue with, like homosexuality, or their lack of willingness to murder infants when murdering children means they get infinite bliss and not murdering means they have a chance of being infinitely tortured.

          By 'his book' I assume you are talking about the Bible. I understand your opinion and I see how this translates to the points you make. I simply accept that I do not know enough about Christianity to make an accurate or useful judgement. I do not mean to strawman you by picking out arguments, but I feel inclined to respond to your comment: Murder is prohibited by their God and Christians aren't in it *just* to go to Heaven. I could explain more of their reasoning, but you'd think I was just preaching to you, so suffice to say *there are reasons you don't know about* and *murdering children does not help them*. I have no knowledge to make comment about homosexuality.

          >Respect is earned not given freely. I don't have an issue with people being dismissive or even antagonistic to groups that have often do the same.

          I realise now that this is a matter of personal preference and I was wrong to require others to reciprocate my views. I do not think this is a useful path to go down though; from a utilitarian standpoint, giving respect takes only self control and goes a long way in earning the respect of others, something essential to spreading rationality in a good light.

          I did notice the group-focus of these comments, and made me consider: I wouldn't think of acting antagonistic to an individual because of something another person in their group said or did (unless of course, they are implicated). Let's be real, if Gelifyal hadn't said anything about his belief, nobody on this sub would've thought of it at all. As an individual he doesn't appear to embody any of the hazardous traits that we worry about (eg. he is willing to think critically of his beliefs).

          And I realise that I kind of assumed Gelifyal to be a guy, so if I'm wrong then oops.

            Identifying with a position is an action. If I call myself a Nazi I don't have to do anything other than that. By calling myself something, by stating that I identify with it, I am giving an identity support and validating it.

            >Murder is prohibited by their God and Christians aren't in it just to go to Heaven. I could explain more of their reasoning, but you'd think I was just preaching to you, so suffice to say there are reasons you don't know about and murdering children does not help them. I have no knowledge to make comment about homosexuality.

            I was raised Christian and while I'm aware they aren't in it just to go to Heaven it doesn't justify how in my, or in my opinion any decent, morality system if by action or inaction you allowed someone to be eternally tortured it suggests to me an obscene lack of empathy bordering on psychopathy. I recognise that Christians think that their partners and children deserve eternal torture if God decides such. Beyond that most Christians haven't even considered it which is absurd to me since you'd think optimisation of morality would be the first thing people think about when given scales as sheer as heaven and hell. I'm happy to acknowledge I'm biased against Christians (and religious people) based on my experience.

            > I do not think this is a useful path to go down though; from a utilitarian standpoint, giving respect takes only self control and goes a long way in earning the respect of others, something essential to spreading rationality in a good light.

            From a utilitarian standpoint encouraging people to see beyond the attitude of a comment and going for the meat of it is much more important to me. I think that stripping emotion from human discussion is an impossible endeavour, especially since you will lose versus someone who is using emotional arguments (why would we give up one of the best methods of spreading ideas), whereas teaching someone to ignore vitriol is a much more practical benefit and should be standard for anyone seeking to achieve rationality. Besides which the practical benefit of shaming a group into isolation which I think is a more relevant (since no one was arguing with him with content hidden in insults, they were just insulting).

            I think this is crazy. If someone walks up to me and says they identify with a group that I know that say, murders, people like me. I would not wait for them to perform an action, their identification is action enough. I don't want to make an assumption but my guess is that your comment has to come from a particularly privileged position where you've never interacted with a group that has targeted you. If a KKK member knocks on your door it might be easy for you to deal with them perfectly normally, but for those hunted by the KKK they might reasonably not open the door.

            I haven't read the story, nor seen any of their comments, I just clicked in the thread and saw your comment. The respect beliefs because they are beliefs is something I've seen a lot and have particular distaste for. In one situation a large group of university students applauded when someone (from another culture) spoke about how they beat their children, and I was in shock that people would normalise something that has no scientific justification (and might be immoral even if it did) in the slightest.

      The etiquette is perfectly rational.  It's there so we can keep having good stories.

      You're free to think religion is wrong.  That's not rude.  Nor is it rude to criticize religion in forums about religion.  Or in a debate with someone who wants to debate religion.  The problem is when people treat the submission of a good story as an invitation to critique the author's personal life.

      Increase the price of writing and we'll get fewer stories.

  What kind of Christian camp gave this awakening?  I’m assuming most people here don’t have a religious background so it’d be nice to know
  ```

  - u/Gelifyal:
    ```
    I'm from a Slavic background (Russian/Ukrainian) and was born there and moved to the USA when I was young. When I say "church camp", I'm using a term that most Americans should be familiar with, despite the Slavic version of it being entirely different.

    While American churches tend to have ages 11-17 be the recipients of church camp, Slavic churches tend to be 17-30 and involve multiple churches from several states - more like a conference but with cabins and all that. Having a Slavic culture brings unity when it isn't readily shared with the outside world, loosely similar to the Families situation in Aeromancer, but heavily similar in the sense that people are judged based on their state location or their last name lol.
    Fun Fact: the MI boys made a homemade bomb and let it off on the campgrounds. It was loud. But no one was surprised it was them that did it.

    This conference basically had several speakers and a lot of hanging out. No one asked for money or really anything for that matter. What stuck out to me the most was a simple phrase:

    >"You don't have to give anything to God *except* what He asks for."

    They don't tell you what's requested. Is money a big deal to someone? Maybe God will ask for that. Is someone placing their job or school above all else? Maybe God will ask for that. A boyfriend/girlfriend? The desired thing doesn't have to be bad.
    It's similar to God asking the rich young ruler to sell everything he owned and give it to the poor. Do all Christians have to do that? Nope. Did the ruler have to? Yup.

    Since Christianity is based on a personal relationship with God who speaks with each individual, God's responses tend to be tailored to that individual.
