## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  I recommend a Manga called shimeji simulation. It begins slow and at the beginning, you might think it's just a slice of live manga but it gets incredibly surreal and profound in the later chapters. It's about the Main characters realizing that they live in a simulation and can manipulate the world at their will and what to do from there.

  A month or so ago, I asked for Xianxia recs for when I finished Reverend Insanity.

  Unfortunately, I checked back on what I remembered was a comprehensive list of recs to find that the user had deleted their profile and their comment.

  So here I am, asking for recs to fill my Xianxia craving, leaving aside the time I spend writing my own work.

  For context, I have read and greatly enjoyed RI and 40 Millenniums of Cultivation, and was so-so on the latter author's Oh My God Earthlings are Insane!.

    Here are some that I’ve personally enjoyed. 


    **Tao Wong’s “Thousand Li” series.**

    https://www.amazon.com/stores/Tao-Wong/author/B073PSD9WY

    Traditional Xianxia, but written by an English speaking author. Decent prose, interesting characters, good world building. The protagonist is no great once-in-a-generation talent, but he gains in ability, power and respect as the series progresses. Very much the story of one cultivator’s Journey To Immortality, so the overall plot isn’t really all that strong, though that might finally be starting to change in the latest books. We’ll see.

    4/5 Stars.

    A good read.


    ========================

    **RedHazard’s “A very cliché Xianxia story.”**

    https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/ave-xia-rem-y-a-very-cliche-xianxia-story.589587/

    Significantly less traditional than the above story and not a comedy in any way, despite the title.

    Very good character writing, decent world building, decent plot. The protagonist of this one is the real selling point for me. He’s a *pleasure* to read. Very smart and talented and also humble and friendly. I do wish the plot progressed a little quicker though.

    4.5/5 Stars.

    I lost a couple of days to this one.

    ===============================

    **Ysrillar’s “Forge of Destiny.”**

    https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/threads-of-destiny-eastern-fantasy-sequel-to-forge-of-destiny.51431/

    or

    https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21188/forge-of-destiny

    This one is a quest, but even if you don’t like to read that particular format, I still strongly recommend that you give it a try. The RR version removes all quest elements and formatting, making it much more readable.

    Forge has some of the best worldbuilding I’ve had the pleasure of reading within amateur fiction. The author spends a *lot* of time fleshing out the world, the cultivation system and the various important characters and it *shows*.
    The character writing is similarly impressive, with a diverse cast of interesting and unique characters.

    As far as the plot goes however… Well, it *exists*, I’ll say that much, but the story is very much carried by the rest of the writing. (Something something, get stronger, something something build a family.)

    4/5 stars.

    =====================================

    **Vesvius’ “A Path Unending.”**

    https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/the-path-unending-a-cultivation-quest.62599/

    Another quest.

    The protagonist is a crafter and his goal is to become the greatest in the world and make his family proud.

    That’s it. That’s the plot.

    On the other hand, the quality of the writing is *really* good and the character writing and world building makes up for the plot in spades. If the update speed was a little faster, I’d honestly say that this one might be my favourite of the lot. The Author’s skill at turning his reader’s schizophrenic votes into coherent character arcs for the protagonist is *really* impressive. 

    4.5/5 stars.

    ====================================

      I wouldn't necessarily rec any of these, except for the one I haven't read (RedHazard’s “A very cliché Xianxia story.”). I wouldn't go so far as to de-rec any of them but imho they aren't really rec worthy.

      &#x200B;

      My ratings:

      Thousand Li 2/5

      Forge 3/5

      Path unending 3/5

        I second these rating, though I **would** go so far as to anti-rec Thousand Li. The first book was pretty good, but the bottom falls out with the second and it becomes clear the author doesn't actually know the first thing about writing characters or plot and the first book was just a fluke. 

        Forge of Destiny is ok, but like happens with all quests the audience driven choices make the protagonist reactive and one-dimensional, the plot linear, and conflict both sparse and anti-climactic.

    Slumrat Rising on RR. Although it's a dangerous read, it's so good it'll likely ruin most other cultivation stories for you. It's a similar setting to 40k of cultivation, but done better, and the worldbuilding is just top tier. 5/5

    &#x200B;

    Hero of the Valley, book series. It's cultivation in a world with several different systems. In some parts of the world they have a litrpg system, in others it's cultivation. Early on the MC is in the system area, later on he moves to the cultivation area. 4/5

    &#x200B;

    Path of Ascension is good but the plot is bland. 3.5/5
    ```

    - u/CaramilkThief:
      ```
      Seconding Slumrat. It takes Gnosticism and makes a cultivation system out of it, in a way that is novel but still makes a lot of sense. Really cool stuff.
      ```

    - u/Anderkent:
      ```
      Slumrat Rising started strong but by chapter 30 it felt like it lost its charm. Maybe I'll come back to it, but for now I'd say YMMV
      ```

      - u/fassina2:
        ```
        Depending on what it is that's bothering you I'd say it's really worth it. The story changes a lot from chapter 30. 

        &#x200B;

        This is a mild spoiler but it's pretty cool to the point that it'd be fun to re read. >!At the time (around chapter 30), he's under subtle mind control.!<

        &#x200B;

        It's really well written..
        ```

    - u/AviusAedifex:
      ```
      Heavy anti-rec for Path of Ascension. It completely misses the point of xianxia and results in a story that has absolutely no stakes and the powerful figures do everything they can to make sure nothing fun can ever happen to the protagonist.

      >!At some point early on the MC obtains a companion who is out on her own to prove she can do it without relying on her family, and then like 20 chapters later something happens and she immediately solves it off screen by relying on her family's power. And if it happened for something that minor I imagine that's how it would go for everything else in the story moving forwards. In comparison to something like Reverend Insanity  or Renegade Immortal where at any time a mistake can cost them everything reading something like that is incredibly boring!< I would only read it if you've read absolutely everything else first. And even then I'd never touch it again.

    It's also the case for me that Reverend Insanity and 40 Millenniums of Cultivation are the only translated Xianxia that I've truly enjoyed.

    Sword God in a World of Magic isn't exactly Xianxia, but the progression system feels very close especially later in the story.

    Lord of the Mysteries, My House of Horrors, and Throne of Magical Arcana are good translated webnovels. They aren't Xianxia though.

    I'll recommend some chinese ones. I'm not really a fan of western xianxia because it feels like it misses the point most of the  time. 

    Renegade Immortal like the other commenter said, as well as Pursuit of the Truth by the same author. I'm not really a fan of the author's other works which are far too comedic and simple in comparison.

    Tales of Herding Gods is really good, it has one of the better settings that I've seen, with fun characters. But I stopped reading it because the translation was both very irregular and bad, but looking at Novelupdates now it looks like there's 1500 chapters out, and there weren't even 500 when I read it so it's probably better now.

    Warlock Apprentice is xuanhuan. It's a more standard western fantasy setting, but it has a very slow pace which I really liked. The setting feels more solid than other ones.

    Here's also some more popcorn focused ones. Worlds’ Apocalypse Online is very interesting. Has a setting that tries to cram a ton of things into it, and it's actually done pretty well. Like it starts off as an regression, but it's also an isekai, but it also switches between two worlds, but then even more stuff happens. It takes like a 100 chapters to get going, but has a good pace afterwards. Also notably it's one of the very few xianxia I've read with a >!multi pov story.!< It also has one of my favorite scenes I've read in any story.

    Way of the Devil is a standard xianxia that has an interesting start where it focuses more the protagonist crashing his way to immortality and it's really fun to read, but sadly the translations were pretty bad.

    Immortal Mortal is another one that I really like. A lot of people like A Mortal's Journey to Immortality but I thought that one was incredibly boring in comparison. 

    Top Tier Providence is comedy focused but it's kind of entertaining. My Senior Brother is Too Steady is similar but more serious, but it's based on an old Chinese book called Investiture of the Gods which isn't translated and is much more obscure than something like Romance of the Three Kingdoms or Water Margin, so I couldn't get into it. Also the rampant harem.

    Speaking off, I would also recommend trying to read something like Water Margin or Romance of  Three Kingdoms though. You can see they took a lot of inspiration from it. And it's cool.

    I would recommend "[When Immortal Ascension Fails Time Travel to Try Again](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/36597/when-immortal-ascension-fails-time-travel-to-try)" which is about an immortal cultivator needing to re-cultivate from scratch (somewhat cracky, strong female MC)

    And the one I myself write, [Reach Heaven Via Feng Shui Engineering, Drug Trade And Tax Evasion](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/68999/reach-heaven-via-feng-shui-engineering) - about engineering around spiritual energy issues, building a sect, and de- and re-constructing some typical xianxia tropes (the latter two parts are only just starting to get put into the story).

    ```
    If you're a fan of *Worm*, there's [*Sect*](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/worm-xianxia-sect.989803/), a Worm x Xianxia crossover.

    Essentially, Taylor is a spirit that attached to a cultivator who was enslaved and abused by her sect. She helps her grow, both in power and as a person, so that she can have a better life.

    Well-written characters and good prose. I can't remember any obvious grammatical mistakes. Worldbuilding is fine, it's basically a Xianxia world.

  Finally finished [Cockatiel x Chameleon](https://archiveofourown.org/works/37616470), which was recommended on this sub a while back. There was a [long-form review](https://recordcrash.substack.com/p/book-review-cockatiel-x-chameleon) posted which got me interested.

  In short, it was an experience. I doubt I understood the message, but it was all kinds of striking. Harper Praise, a woman with no substance to her life, attaches herself to an arrogant anime porn artist, Van Der Gramme, who roleplays his scenarios before he draws them. Gramme has a talent for finding words (and more words) to justify his mission, and Praise, who roleplays for him with literary finesse, begs the universe that he isn't just another bag of hot air. It's steeped in a web culture which I was never a part of, so I'm sure I missed a lot, but before long the story starts taking on a mythological feeling. Praise's desperate search for something to dissolve herself in to (or a snack to ensnare into her spider's web) is at once endearing and terrifying,  and it's the ways in which the characters hurt each other and failed to be more than apparitions from a dream or nightmare which evokes significance to me.

  The writing is excellent and the erotic elements, for the most part, were more writerly than pornographic. Don't let the tags frighten you away from the story- this is no smut. The worst of it was the last gore roleplay. Overall it was surprisingly readable (if sometimes dark and traumatic). Though I should mention that my disgust tolerance for these things is likely high.
  ```

- u/thisisnotathrowa:
  ```
  I want to recommend the Fire Emblem Three Houses Fan Fiction [An Eagle Among Lions](https://archiveofourown.org/works/24608248/chapters/59445880)

  The morning after her and Byleth's wedding, Emperor Edelgard von Hresvelg wakes up in her old bedroom in Garreg Mach to discover that she has brown hair, only one Crest, ten happy and healthy brothers and sisters, and a bad habit of sleeping through her professor's lectures. Hubert is unusually cheerful, Byleth teaches the Blue Lions, and nobody has heard of the Flame Emperor. Instead, a figure known as the Hurricane King and his sinister cohort the Death Knight stalk the monastery.

  No sooner has Edelgard sought out this new world's Byleth than she finds herself standing in the eye of a storm of continent-spanning conspiracies centered on a young man with snow-white hair — one that will engulf Garreg Mach, the Holy Kingdom of Faerghus, the Adrestian Empire, and Edelgard's own family as it carries the roaring winds of war across Fodlan. A threat from a past so ancient it predates even Fodlan's oldest and murkiest myths is stirring, threatening to tear time itself asunder — and it may be her only way back home.

  Complete at 1.6 million words it is very long and will keep you entertained for a while. I wouldn't call it rational, but I think most of the members here would find it enjoyable. The author has done a wonderful job of expanding and filling out the characters without completely changing them from who they are in the games. The story itself feels well written and planned out with very little grammar or spelling mistakes. Characters will generally act the way you expect them to with lots a moments to grow and changed, and you won't find characters holding the idiot ball to move the plot forward. I won't say you need to have played the game to enjoy the story but I would definitely recommend doing so beforehand to get a better appreciation of some events you won't understand otherwise.

  Anyone have recommendations for some space opera / military scifi, preferably in audiobook format? Nothing to heavyweight, I'm looking primarily for something to listen to during exercise.

  Stuff in this direction that I liked/have read:

  - The *Expeditionary Force* series by Craig Alanson. I have mixed feelings about this, but mostly because it's dragging on too long. The first half-dozen to dozen books in the series are fine and entertaining--I like how it makes a reasonable attempt at hardish scifi (or at least respecting it's own rules when it comes to the FTL and other spacecraft clarketech)--but it's become clear that the author has found a formula that works and the latter books have gotten repetitive with similar "plot" beats where basically nothing really happens that the reader hasn't seen before. Still, it captures a good "HFY" essence, showing how insanely difficult it is to compete with or have victories against a more technologically advanced alien force as (very minor spoilers) it turns out that the entire force that conquered and subjugated Earth was just a single raiding party from a small clan and consisted of like a couple hundred low-level aliens. I've written a longer review on this somewhere that I can dig up if people are interested. 

  - The *Old Man's War* series by John Scalzi. Good stuff, and just a lot of fun to read. Fun and diverse scifi. Occasionally plays a bit fast-and-loose with the tech, but Scalzi is a skilled writer who delivers. This has everything from high-stakes diplomacy to special forces storming alien palaces and more. 

  - The "Interdependency" trilogy, also by John Scalzi. Feels a bit like Dune with space-nobility, and definitely is "Space Opera" and to me feels more like fantasy in a sci-fi setting (like Star Wars) than "true scifi". That said, It's a good and fun read, and again, Scalzi is a professional writer.

    Nothing too heavyweight does remove a few recommendations, cause there are a few good mil-sci-fi stories that lean into the military side. The best recommendation that I have for you is the Vorkosigan Saga by Louis McMaster Bujold. If you have premium audible a decent amount of the Vorkosigan Saga is free on there, no credits needed. It’s rational (at least rational adjacent), fairly short (most are about 10 hours long) and free! I have a bunch of other stories I could recommend, but I don’t know if they are audiobooks or not.

    I like all those. I don't have what you asked, but here's some stuff you might like that's a step or two removed.

    - Chris Nuttall's stuff is all decent, not as funny as the above but decent.
    - Dungeon Crawler Carl is not space opera, it's scifi litrpg. But it's funny.
    - Scalzi's other stuff is good, especially Redshirts
    - People who like Scalzi might like Joe Haldeman. He did the Forever war and most of his stuff is good.
    - Larry Niven stuff is just fun.

  [aviation is really remarkably safe](https://www.glowfic.com/posts/7250) is a short glowfic by lintamande about a passenger plane getting isekai'd-or-something. 

  I do not recommend it for the isekai element; the story ends before that can really get going. Instead, this is a fine example of competence porn in the field of aviation. (I assume lintamande either works there or has done their reading.) It contains intelligent characters who do sensible things, and all the safety protocols modern aviation can throw at a problem.

  #[*Swallowtail*](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/swallowtail-worm-au.970396/threadmarks) by NotDis

  ##PROs

  • prot's power

  •• the prose used for describing her power's data output to her

  • character psychology, human psychology 

  •• prot's use of operant conditioning, well-crafted prose thereof

  • oftentimes, the prose and dialogues — though at other times the narrative felt stilted and awkward

  • well-done superhero aesthetics

  • 3D GloryGirl; a Labyrinth that isn't just a human-shaped plot device; well-sketched Butcher

  • some of the chat logs were hilarious

  • nice view of the behind-the-curtains operation of the powers

  • original / AU setting

  •• almost no canon stations

  • the initial parts of the story were rather rational (except for the >!PRT HQ infiltration thing!<). 

  • No on-screen Endbringer fights; •that killed suspension of disbelief; •that interrupted a plan or dialogue near its conclusion; etc

  • the text's rather dense; there aren't that many "empty" sentences or paragraphs

  ##CONs

  •misc

  •• so far it's been almost entirely BB gangwars and cape bickering. Prose's high quality somewhat helps, but the overall plotline is still rather dull.

  •• canon!Taylor often displayed aptitude for systemic thinking. Here it's mostly lacking, perhaps due to Lisa's absence from her team.

  •• has that problem of not answering "why aren't capes (esp. rogues and "villains") using their comparative advantage to generate safe / muggle lucrative income". E.g. prot could be finding deposits of gold and other valuable natural resources for her team to sell, could be doing industrial espionage worldwide, etc. Nothing like that even comes up in a conversation.

  •• satellite surveillance never becomes a thing for prot to notice and work around

  •• prot has this habit of refusing to do something "immoral" (e.g. unmasking capes through her power), waiting for that strat to bite her in the ass, then eventually getting forced to go back on her "principles" anyway. In the end, she ends up losing her higher moral ground either way, but also losing the advantage that committing to that MO would've given her if she adopted it from the beginning.

  •• the narration drops at cliffhangers to switch to some other PoV. Many of those interesting scenes never receive an on-screen resolution.

  ••• I suggest to stop reading once you reach an unfinished arc, as the cliff-hanger PoV switches could make it rather annoying

  -

  • prot is slower and less intelligent than her canon!self

  •• In general, she's much less curious, inquisitive, and inventive about her power

  ••• doesn't try experimenting with removal of short-term memories (on opponents as a fight tactic and info-denial tool, on allies as an anti-master/stranger defence)

  ••• doesn't try to utilise the trump aspects of her power (train to predict, block, replicate powers)

  •••• this only happens much later on with >!Burnscar!<, and even then: 1) it's a product of plot railroading rather than a conscious / proactive choice; 2) even when already having a successful case like that in her repertoire, she *still* fails to experiment further on her own initiative. She even gets weird dream-snippets about powers she's recently interacted with, and mostly all she does about it is generate one-two gloomy internal monologue lines and move on. Her boss specifically tells her to write down those dreams for further analysis, and even that she fails to do. Consequently, the entire thing felt more like a plot device (e.g. foreshadowing) than information that someone like Taylor would realistically be reacting to.

  •• Leaks unjustified amounts of into to thinkers (e.g. Lisa), for no good reason. E.g. can *constantly* make herself mostly invisible during meet-ups but doesn't.

  •• missed / unused strats

  ••• devising a more efficient prot-powered communication protocol between teammates

  •••• e.g. having "keyboards" on teammates' arms to use for quickly sending them messages, acting as a secure and unblockable comm-hub in general

  ••• concealing teammates during team meetings, other important discussions

  ••• memory deletion, sensory blocking (not used to full potential)

  ••• trying to learn to follow a digital signal to its destination, making honey-pots for hackers, etc

  ••• better, team-wide use of Newter-fluids

  ••• pre-emptively locating all the major players in the city, claiming their bases and bodies into her domain, constantly surveilling at least the leaders

  •• rash and stupid decisions in general, e.g.: "I rage about how stupid I’d been to engage without more information on how their powers work."

  ••• and guess what she does not even 10 pages after that quote? Decides to go after Fog *and another* powerful / unknown cape all by her squishy self and a still rather-unpredictable >!Burnscar!< as a teammate. The way they leeroy-jenkins'ed into that fight should've ended with her dead, if not for the plot armor.

  -

  • plot railroadings, more character stupidity

  •• Faultline selling an incredibly specific bit of info in a way that would lead back to Taylor's capabilities as the source of that info, and then making a pikachu face when those capabilities eventually get leaked. In the same scene, Taylor also leaks those caps to a random cape that they were just kidnapping / delivering to a third party.

  > [T to F, with the random cape listening nearby:] "... The edges of the lightning are shaping material, carving glass and metal into shapes. Tiny little triangles, too small to see, each one is different. It's like a snowflake?"

  > ...

  > [F to client:] “Two fifty, and I tell you something important about ‘Changó’ for you to pass on to the PRT.”

  > [C:] “Your source?”

  > [F to client:] “One of my team has a sensory power with good range.”

  •• starting from the >!Elite boss arc (prot's gang getting "indebted" to them and having to work for them for six weeks)!<, the story significantly strips prot's whole gang of their agency. The plot deteriorates into a worsening spiral of bad decisions, many of which felt like railroaded ones.

  ••• loss of >!Palanquin's insurance money!<

  •• the whole >!false-flag attacks on Elite!< felt unwise to me. pretty much anything that could've gone wrong (e.g. >!the Elite!< sending in a thinker, or even just sending someone in when prot's team was in the middle of a >!false-flag!<) would've just ended up seriously harming their reputation.

  •• prot using a "hidden" aspect of her power on a newbie hero cape to try and threaten him into doing something, when it was obvious that there wasn't any real weight behind her threat. She basically just ended up giving a huge amount of data about her capabilities to that hero, by extension to the PRT, and anyone else capable of hacking either one. This when there's a bunch of hacker-centric capes running around in BB and when that bit of info would likely significantly harm her team's relationship with PRT and hero-capes.

  •• various characters drawing the wrong conclusions and getting aggroed at prot and her gang for their suspected ties / cooperation (AKA accepting contracts from) with E88 leftovers. This when PRT itself has already hired >!Rune!< by that point.

  ***Young Girl's Criminal Record, A*** by **TorontoTowers**

  • exploitation genres: people feeling impressed by how smart prot is; people being terrified of prot

  (+) interesting prose, premise

  (-) not much happens in the story, despite prot's gang's might. The later chapters especially have too much therapy-related content. Which, admittedly, may prove to be worthwhile when the story's finished, but RN it just feels like empty chapters.

  -

  ***Nineveh*** by **aospare** — the way the narrative's designed makes it interesting to read, but the punchline >!(prot's power being a mix of Accord's and Contessa's)!< somewhat trivialises it.

  (+) not too drawn out

  -

  ***Riley Alone*** by **R3N41SS4NC3** — Riley as prot, but she's mostly just horsing around and doing low-impact cape shenanigans. 

  (-) Despite the tag, the story's not complete — just its first arc is. Could potentially be interesting if it got a long wordcount and was actually finished.

  -

  ***Dominion*** by **Materia-Blade**

  • exploitation genres: antihero / antag prot; prot being a tyrant, killing, etc because the "circumstances" forced them to; etc

  (+) interesting power exhibition: Khepri-type people-control

  ± the limitations of such a power (gradual loss of brainspace) outlined in canon aren't present

  (-) a central theme of the story is that annoying trope often used in canon where OP antags keep hobbling themselves, playing cat-and-mouse, almost-but-never catching / killing prots, etc. 

  (+) the punchline's somewhat interesting, but doesn't merit a 50p story. (+) Prot's power's interesting, but the way she uses it and keeps whining about it makes it annoying.

  Looking for proactive, driven protagonists. 

  They should do anything for their dreams. big plus if the goal is difficult and unique (not just becoming the strongest/survival/saving the world).

  No xianxia,

  Some examples I liked:

  [The Pureblood Pretense](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7613196/1/The-Pureblood-Pretense) \- Harry Potter AU where Hogwarts is only for purebloods. Harriet wants to become the best potion mistress so she swaps places with her cousin to learn there.   
  Highly recommend this one, in these type of stories the mc is quickly found out and it the premise doesnt really matter that much, here keeping her identity secret is a big part of the story for a long time. Big plus for a smart mc too, she doesnt just reveal her secret to friends she knows for a month, has a backup plans in case she gets found out etc.

  Mistborn: Fallen Empire - I really liked Kelsier in this one, does some crazy things to start a rebelion and overthrow the government. Dont want to spoil this one.

  The Eminence in Shadow- I've read the light novel but it also has anime and manga. Main character wants to be a cool, mysterious mastermind. Trains very hard, practices cool lines, waits hours just to make an entrance. Even if its a silly goal he goes far and commits to it. Would prefer a bit more serious story though.

  Raise, a RWBY fan fic by Coeur Al'Aran where Jaune gets a Semblence that allows him to resurrect the recently deceased, was mentioned last week https://m.fanfiction.net/s/14043289/1/Raise, and I decided to read through it. 

  It's not bad, but suffers a bit from being repetitious, which makes it drag a bit. It also feels rather preachy at times, which makes me think the author was soapboxing a bit about how he feels about online critics? Not sure, but it came with a strong implication that famous people deserve their fame and those who criticize them are just losers who don't put in the effort and just criticize others because it's easier than working hard. Felt rather icky. I do think it had some good exploration of how fame affects people, especially those raised in the upper class compared to those who get fame suddenly thrust upon them, but I'm not sure if that's a strong enough theme to recommend the series. It also goes over the impact that online/media criticism has on people, but I think something like Oshi No Ko does a much better job of making that point.

  The author's writing is solid, and if you like the first few seasons of RWBY, then it's fun to see how the plot veers off course based on one small change to the canon - that's kind of the author's entire schtick. But overall I'd say it's only just recommended if you like his other stuff and RWBY fan fics in particular. I enjoyed his "Forged Destiny" story better, since it's a much bigger change to the world of Remnant itself rather than just a small change like this one.
  ```

  - u/Darkpiplumon:
    ```
    *** Disclaimer, I'm a Coeur Al'Aran fan and read pretty much all of their stories ***

    So, I do agree with the cons that you've said. Coeur writes a chapter of about 5 stories every week, so it's sadly true that some themes get repeated over and over again, something that you don't realize as much if you read a chapter every day. Raise is not one of my favorites in part for that. I agree with Oshi no Ko too, so good.

    Now, the good. If you liked the first volumes of RWBY, or have knowledge of the series through any means, I can't recommend Coeur enough. Some knowledge at all it's pretty much needed though.
    His stories are constantly the best rated RWBY fanfic in their platforms, and have pretty different styles (comedy, horror, comedy/horror, real world supernatural AU, 40k grimdark, slice of life and general RWBY vibes, among others). Given that I'm also not a fan of Forged Destiny, here are some of my favourites, all of them complete:


    The Self Made Man: Mafia protagonist. Even if it's a little bit forced, a surprisingly reasonable tale of the ascension of Jaune as a Mafia Capo, with the difficult choices involved.

    Professor Arc: Dumb comedy. One of its earliest novels, very stupid and very funny.

    Relic of the Future: Guilty pleasure/slice of life. Jaune goes back in time as his older self and adopts Emerald, a previous enemy as a kid.

    Arc Corp: Library of Ruina/SCP inspired comedy/horror. Blake and Jaune go solving the mystery of the week and suffering mental traumas.

    The Unseen Hunt: Earth AU, only some people can see/fight the Grimm and they're perpetually fight. Surprisingly potent imagery, and not as dumb as it sounds. Not as much of a following as I'd expect.

    All in all:

    + Interesting and dynamic RWBY stories, in different scenarios and with different themes.
    + Very regular new chapters. 5 new chapters a week from 6 different stories.
    + Mostly cover the beginning of RWBY or go their own way, so if you only liked the first volumes, you're in luck.
    + I shit you not, one of his stories is a Fate Holy Grail War with most of his Jaunes as Servants. And it works! This is a symbol of greatness and I won't accept any opposed word.


    - Most of his protagonists are Jaune, even if he rapidly evolves from his Jaunebaby canon phase, for those with Jaunephobia.
    - Fast chapters means grammatical mistakes and worse focus sometimes
    ```

    - u/AurelianoTampa:
      ```
      All good points, and while Raise is the first one I've read from the author in several years, I did enjoy some of the other ones I read in the past (Professor Arc being one of them). 

      >I'm also not a fan of Forged Destiny

      Just curious, why is that? As said, it's been several years since I read it, but I had a generally positive memory of it. What turned you off?
      ```

  - u/Revlar:
    ```
    Yeah, there's some definite political bleed in the story and while the author tries to have a diverse set of voices in terms of economics, it mostly comes off as RWBY by Ayn Rand. Famous people are better. All critics are envious shitbags. Critique is a slippery slope towards ruining famous people's lives, getting all their loved ones killed and ruining the country.
    ```
