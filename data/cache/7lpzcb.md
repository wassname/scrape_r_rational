## Rationalist Wish fulfilment

### Post:

It's winter break and I want to unwind before the next semester. I'm looking for wish fulfilment material (this means I need a character I can self insert into). I'm accepting novels (both original English novels and translated ones), manga, and anime (I'd rather read the manga, as written entertainment is much more portable than video ).     
Requirements:   

1. Male (some of my favourite MCs are female, but I can't/won't self insert in female characters).  
2. Preferably in their teens to twenties (older/younger characters make the self insert more difficult).   
3. High-fantasy/Sci-fi or a combination of both. This is just a bonus as I care more about the character than the settings, but I tend to prefer those settings.    
4. For certain reasons, I seem to find original fics more palatable than fanfics (HPMOR is the only rat fanfic I really enjoyed (I generally don't read fanfic of franchises I'm ignorant of).  
&nbsp;    
[I want a character like the guy who took the black pill](http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/06/02/and-i-show-you-how-deep-the-rabbit-hole-goes/).       
&nbsp;    

####Edit   
I'm looking for a character with the same personality as Black, not a character with the same ability. A character who actually weaponises decision theory. So I want a smart rationalist MC. MC doesn't need any special powers (in case it wasn't clear).

All recommendations are appreciated, thanks in advance.

  Easy answer: Mother of Learning. Male teen character, original fiction inspired by D&D, though the knowlege absolutely isn’t required, any spell more advanced than Magic Missile is explained. Not *quite* high fantasy, but close, and has an interesting technomagical scene. 

  Main character is fairly easy to self-insert into, I know I have, he can be a bit stubborn at times, though. 

  Read it here: https://m.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/1/Mother-of-Learning

  I'd say Pact, but it's only wish fulfillment if you're a relentless masochist.

  Heros Save The World, but it jumps between viewpoints, only some of which fulfill your criteria, and is less wish fulfillment than existential thriller flavoured with superpowers and a rationalist bent. Imagine mashing together Dan Brown, Dan Wells, and Wildbow.

  Twig: see Pact. If that's wish fulfillment for you, please never meet a genie.

  Honestly MoL is probably best. It's a bit dry at times, but is popcorn-y while still being dense enough to be interesting.

  UNSONG. It's... Not quite what you're looking for. But it's weird enough that it's just damn *fun* to read, and the main character fits your criteria.

          Because we used to have a minor problem with redpill-types, and when you phrased it the way that you used to, you came off as a redpiller. 

          EDIT: handy link just in case you're unfamiliar with the term. This is where "red pill movement" redirects to on Wikipedia -  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manosphere

          - u/None:
            ```
            I don't really care whether I come off as a redpiller TBH. At least on this sub, I don't think it should be at all relevant what one's political leanings are.
            ```

            - u/callmesalticidae:
              ```
              Yeah, I dunno. We just recently had to ban all discussion of U.S. politics, so... It comes up, and people do care. 

              Plus, we're not robots, you know? Even if it doesn't come up as a major topic of discussion, if I know that [user] is an anti-semite, that *is* going to color my interactions with that user in this sub.
              ```

              - u/None:
                ```
                I wish it wasn't so. I think being able to partition different aspects of ourselves is an important skill; in this sub, we're all fiction fans, and nothing else is relevant? I see our political affiliations as relevant to this sub, as for example our race (or biological sex).
                ```

            - u/eaglejarl:
              ```
              For myself, I dislike having people in my communities who base their identity on oppression and/or hatefulness, even if my interactions with them don't involve those elements.  For example, it would make me uncomfortable to receive a "wow, I love your writing" comment from a Nazi, neo- or otherwise. Turn that uncomfortableness up a few orders of magnitude if they actually started spouting their beliefs. 

              The red pill movement in particular is based on the idea that men should be uber-masculine and domineering, because it will make women submit, obey, and provide sex. That is an abrasive personality that I do not want to have around, and people who explicitly choose to be like that are people for whom I have contempt. It is also an irrational beliefset, which goes pretty strongly against the spirit of this sub. 

              It may be typical mind fallacy, but it seems likely to me that other people on this sub have the same feelings, and that's why we don't want red-pill types around. 

              EDIT ADDENDUM: You probably *should* care if you come off like a red pill type, since it's a subcommunity that promotes strong reactions in a lot of people. If you aren't a redpiller then you don't want to get tarred with their brush. If you ARE a redpiller then it's still a good idea to think about if you want to lay it out there all the time, since it's going to close doors for you. If the goal is to make women sleep with you then it's probably better to save the redpill act for atomspace where you can at least theoretically reap the benefits. No woman online is going to be so impressed with your red-pill-endowed manliness that she's going to hop in her car and drive over to your place for a wild eight-second ride.

                I'm somewhat conflicted on this. On one hand I think a place that tries to uphold the ideas of rationality is exactly the type of place we want to see Red Pillers come to, in the hopes that they can see reasonable non-sensationalized arguments against their point of view that might convince them to change their way of thinking.

                However, this sub isn't primarily concerned with rational discussion and debate, but is more a vehicle for discovering and recommending rational/rationalist fiction. So such a debate about politics or gender relations would be out of place here outside of the context of fiction that explores those topics.

                Ideally there should be a place where we can logically discuss these type of issues with the people who actually hold those opinions without dismissing their arguments and saying "You're wrong and we don't want you here". But it makes sense that this subredit isn't that place.
                ```

                - u/eaglejarl:
                  ```
                  I agree. If a redpiller wanted to post some well-written red-pill based rational fiction as a means of propagandizing, I'd be onboard with discussing it. Otherwise, something like LessWrong would be a better choice.

                This is my opinion. I vowed sometime earlier this year to forgo politics and the culture war completely. I don't know about my current political leanings, but before I decided to forsake politics, I found evangelical liberals grating.   
                &nbsp;    
                I don't want to say whether or not I am/was a redpiller, as it is my belief that it should be of no relevance, like for example my race.

                  That's a reasonable attitude, but I warn you that, even if you decide to forsake politics and the "culture war", they probably aren't willing to forsake *you*.

    Why is there a problem if I can't self insert in female characters? I have no problem with female characters, but this is wish fulfilment—I'd need to want to be female for this to work. Are you going to complain I'm ageist as well?
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      Well, what kind of characters you can easily relate to is your own business and I won't judge anyone for that, but the way you phrased it sounds very... suggestive and made me giggle for about 10 seconds.

          Ok, any phrase along the lines of "I self insert in <whatever> characters" sounds like talking about sex, so you may want to say it differently, perhaps something like: "I find that wish-fulfillment type of stories work best when the main characters resembles me, even superficially. Specifically, I find it easy to relate to characters of my own age and gender" or something like that.

              On second thought I think your suggestion isn't what I want. I can relate to characters who are not like me in any aspect, and that's not what I'm talking about when I say self insert. I mean to put on the skin of another character, become them. And I think self insert is the best term for describing that. If people think that's sexual, then that's their problem.

  Here's an original LitRPG I've been enjoying: [Threadbare](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/threadbare-original-litrpg.43430/). The main character is a golem made from a teddy bear. He starts at the bottom of the intelligence scale, but gets smarter as he levels. Lots of puns, instead of a manna pool everyone gets a bunch of pools for stuff like moxie, will, and sanity. It might not be along the lines you are looking for, but more original than most I've seen and pretty well written.

  I've been binge reading [With This Ring (Young Justice SI)](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-story-only.25076/) which I think meets most of your criteria. The author intends it to be SI, and even says it in the title. Not quite original fic as the protagonist wakes to finds himself in what seems to be a variant blend of different versions of DC universes, with an Orange Lantern power ring, but it is a rational fiction take on that which might have similar characteristics to what you appreciated in HPMOR. The main story line is interspersed with excerpts from a parallel story line in which the protagonist's handling of the situation is a bit more extreme, and a few other parallel story vignettes taking place in other parallel universes. The story is still ongoing, but the author seems very prolific. I am reading faster than new chapters are being written, but it will still take me a long time to catch up.

  [Edit update] - BTW, I'll second the suggestions for both *Worth the Candle* and *Mother of Learning* which I finished the binge reads of and am now reading as new chapters come out.

  Aside from Worth the Candle, I could recommend [This Has Not Gone Well](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/61ya08/oh_this_has_not_gone_well/) from r/HFY. MC is dropped into a fantasy world and starts picking some low hanging fruit. Occasionally gets NSFW but nothing too terrible.
  ```

  - u/Stopppit:
    ```
    I started reading This Has Not Gone Well. So far it reads like someone trying to mimic rationalist fiction by having a main character with an insane memory (and that's it). I'm not even sure it qualifies as rational fiction considering how the plot has only moved forward by means of low effort foreshadowing and one massive idiot ball. [Spoilers](#s " He leaves his travel plans to get to Nimre in the hands of a random hot wench he fucks for a week...And then gets captured by the resident slave traders who he had clear warning of and takes no precautions for.") I'll try to get through a bit more to see if it gets better but my expectations are low.

  I know you said you haven't had much success with Fan Fiction, But if you have even a passing knowledge of Naruto I would recommend [Waves Arisen](https://wertifloke.wordpress.com/2015/01/25/chapter-1/) which gives off a very HPMOR feel in my opinion. 

  The main character is intelligent and uses everything in his power to try to both understand and exploit the mechanisms by which the world runs.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    I didn't like Waves Arisen (part of why I said I don't want fanfiction). This wasn't due to poor writing, but because the author decided to take a dump on several of my favourite characters, so I didn't like the plot.   
    &nbsp;      
    As for HPMOR, I've only ever read (part of) one book, and watched part 1 of the Deathly Hallows, and it was so long ago, that I didn't have any attachment to any of the characters in the original Harry Potter series. This lack of attachment (and the way HPMOR was written) enabled me to experience it as original fiction.     
    &nbsp;     
    I get attached to characters, so fanfics that don't treat my beloved characters well aren't very enjoyable.

  If you'll settle for 1-3, the MC merely more reasonable and educated than everyone around him rather than a rationalist super-genius, and the story being an amateur translation of a Chinese web novel that is the usual quality of an amateur translation of a Chinese web novel, try [Release That Witch](https://www.webnovel.com/book/7931338406001705/Release-That-Witch). 

  It's about a Chinese engineer who gets body-swapped into a body of a worthless princeling in a fantasy kingdom that's about to plunge into a whole lot of trouble, decides to use his knowledge to turbocharge this land into industrial revolution. He is helped in this matter by a witch (and then more and more of them) he decides to take a chance on and save from a stake burning, even though everyone in this land thinks they're evil incarnate.
