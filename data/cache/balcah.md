## [META] Whatever happened to Naruto: Need To Become Stronger?

### Post:

It was a pretty great Naruto Rational Fic, last updated in January and then nothing. Kinda weird for it to drop off the map after several years of updating...

  ```
  There was a gap of about nine months between chapter 35 and 36 so it's not like this is unprecedented. Back then they mentioned they lost their job. Maybe they are still in a rough financial situation and don't have the time.

  - u/GreatSwordsmith:
    ```
    The gap between 35 and 36 was due to the author taking a hiatus to write scars samsara 2, as they clearly stated before the hiatus started

          A lot of people who write fiction do it for fun. It must have stopped being fun for this person. =[

          Did anyone ask on Twitter?

  I was recently wondering the same thing. It's one of my favorite rational fanfictions.
