  No-one is standing on top of a tall structure with a piezoelectric plate and lying to create power from the water fall (that we know of), however the characters have intelligently adapted to the strange phenomenon.

  Good stuff!  I'd be interested in seeing other thing that would change in regards to water. Most notibally, how does politics change? Especially on a global level. Does writing cause water when read? Will that make all writing no longer as trust worthy? Do courts use humidity sensors? Is the water usable as evidence in court?

    It isn't just writing; consider media.  Does an actor in a show get drenched because in order to play a character he must make statements that are not true about himself?  If the answer is no, can you hire someone to give a speech for you?  For that matter, could you believe "the statements in the speech are literally false, but they are not designed to mislead" and make a speech without getting detected as a liar?  If you cannot, what happens if your statements are literally true, but you know that 1 out of 1000 people in the audience will misinterpret them as something false?  1 out of 50?  1 out of 1.5?

    Does the whole thing detect intentional recklessness and bias, but where the speaker doesn't know (because of his bias) that he's lying?  If so, that could take politics in an even worse direction than it already is, since politics would then select for people who genuinely but irrationally believe crazy things.

    What happens if you construct an untruth out of one or more truths, by using prerecorded media (so you don't need to say anything additional), such as taking a statement out of context?

      I feel, within the world as stated, you could write a story about a famous actor who is ruined by the advent of the water and learns how to redefine what acting means to him, to say truths that are not factually correct and remain dry.
      ```

  What a blessed phenomenon- it combines 'gives you useful information without a causal interaction, essentially functioning as an oracle' AND 'creates negentropy out of nothingness'! It's like a neat package of everything rational exploitationfics want to have in their settings to exploit.

  It's so exploitable I don't know where to begin, and I probably don't even NEED to figure out where to begin.
  ```

  - u/aeschenkarnos:
    ```
    If I understood it properly, the mysterious water-splasher defined "lies" subjectively rather than objectively, and only assessed statements, not questions. So it's not an oracle, it's a truth serum.
    ```
