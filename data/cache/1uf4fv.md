  I do wonder what the Pokeballs-on-humans thing will come down to. Do Pokemon simply have fundamentally different brain anatomy? Or do Pokemon take brain damage every time a Pokeball is used and the trainer just doesn't notice? And, of course, if you outlaw research, only outlaws etc. Team Rocket simulation attacks?

  [edit] Oh, one thing that wasn't clear and that I do _really_ want an answer to. Pokeballs dematerialize human, materialize again, human has brain damage. But Pokemon are _aware_ in their balls. So does the brain damage happen on scanning, or on materialization?

  [edit] I really like, in general, how the fic sticks to the pattern of "smart, competent and informed people explaining their reasoning". Some people here seem to think "rational" is just a synonym for "realistic".

    My guess would be that people simply dont *care* that much about the brain damage pokemon get, it might even be beneficial making them more docile and obedient.

    This question seems to have gotten garbled somewhat?

    Ok, so here's the way I'm envisioning it:

    The transmutation from matter to energy and vice-versa is precise enough that it preserves just about everything organic that's part of the scanned organism. 

    This including all the cells and microbes and bacteria and whatnot that complex life forms contain within themselves, all in the same position they had been in. So when a pokeball absorbs a complex organism that, for example, has bacteria in their small intestine that assist in digestion, it all gets released in the same exact position it had been, rather than having those bacteria reform in its bloodstream or in somewhere in a bone or something.

    The brain, however, is a different matter: creatures with basic perceptions of time and self-awareness can come through it more or less unharmed.  Not exactly unchanged... but not detrimental to what humans want in pokemon, meaning less individuality, less unpredictability, more submissive/suggestive.  It's not quite right to say pokemon are *aware* in their balls, so much as their time in the ball can be translated to a suggested memory or experience upon release.  If you've played the latest Pokemon, X and Y, think of Pokemon Amie or Supertraining as these kinds of things.

    The higher cognitive functions of people, on the other hand, are much more fragile.  Whether because the technology hasn't advanced enough yet, or simply because of the complexity of the information processed, the transition utterly screws with their memory, sense of self, personality... essentially what we consider their "mind."  At best, they're reduced to an infantile/animal state: at worst, near catatonic.

      It's a reference to the saying "If you outlaw guns, only outlaws will have guns" or more generally, "if you outlaw X, only outlaws will X" where X is both dangerous and a competetive advantage in a fight.

      "Simulation attack" is an umbrella term for all the shenanigans you can get up to if you can simulate somebody and convince them that they're in reality. Conversational replay attacks, predicting behaviors, "we are simulating 1000 copies of you having this conversation, if you turn us down we'll torture them, how likely is it that you're the real one" etc.

      > the transition utterly screws with their memory, sense of self, personality... essentially what we consider their "mind." 

      This does imply that Pokemon either have none of those things, or are unable to notice the difference. What about the smarter breeds? Capturing Mew == insanity? Is that how Mewtwo came about?

        Yes, but there are still measures of warfare those in authority that consider themselves the "good guys" simply cannot condone by use.  

        Weaponizing the ability to effectively turn people into vegetables is one of them. Like biological warfare, criminals or terrorists may employ such tactics, but retaining the moral highground comes with some sacrifices.

        >"Simulation attack" is an umbrella term for all the shenanigans you can get up to if you can simulate somebody and convince them that they're in reality. Conversational replay attacks, predicting behaviors, "we are simulating 1000 copies of you having this conversation, if you turn us down we'll torture them, how likely is it that you're the real one" etc.

        1) People aren't conscious while in pokeballs, and upon exiting one would be too mentally damaged to remember any programmed experiences while in one.

        2) If the above technological hurdles were theoretically leaped, it would still require belief on the part of the subject, which would be difficult as such a breakthrough would be secret.

        >This does imply that Pokemon either have none of those things, or are unable to notice the difference. What about the smarter breeds? 

        Yes, this fic is based much more on the games than the anime, where the mean pokemon intelligence is much closer to a dog's than a human's.  The smarter breeds are predominantly psychic types, and the whole psychic phenomenon is something I'm going to address eventually :) Suffice to say the ability to bend spoons doesn't require a human intelligence.

        >Capturing Mew == insanity? 

        Any pokemon with intelligence approaching the human level would be mentally harmed by being caught, yes: they might retain some superior intelligence, but it would be something like a lobotomy that removes their ability to think for themselves and, say, decide to fly away the second they're released from the ball.

        >Is that how Mewtwo came about?

        *singasong* Yoooou'll seeee...

  Hey guys, here's Chapter 4. Still out of the country, so edits might be a bit slow at first.

  Something of note in this chapter: the economy of pokemon according to the games is just utterly screwy. Pokedollars are based on Japanese yen, each of which is equivalent to a penny. So in the games, a bottle of water is 200 pokedollars, or 2 dollars. Not a big deal, right? Except a pokeball is ALSO 200 pokedollars, while a bottle of soda is 300. Which means that somehow one of the most advanced pieces of technology we could conceive of is so cheap in labor and materials to make that it costs less than a soda. And that's not even getting into the $100,000 bicycles.

  Like I said: utterly screwy.

  So I'm going to scrap and rebuild it from the ground up. I'm going to use $ to represent the currency for ease and simplicity, and try to rescale things into a more rational framework, but don't jump to any conclusions about how everything is priced based just on this chapter, as the technology they have available warps the price of many things, and it's going to be a work in progress. Any feedback or suggestions appreciated.

  I really enjoy how you're writing pokemon catching, with most battles being against groups and the threat of how to keep the pokemon from running away being a major concern.  I hope they stay a big part of the series.

  Something I just remembered is that when you beat Giovani for the third time he decides to end his life of crime and become a scholar (or go back to being one, since it's implied that he was some kind of researcher in his youth), so that's something interesting to look forward to in this.
