  Man, the last few chapters were basically "Paragon really is terrible, maybe Commonplace is (with exception to the bombings) justified."

  Then you get hit with this chapter and now there's no one to root for.

  I don't like following up a cliffhanger with a flashback that doesn't resolve it, but this was nonetheless an interesting chapter. 

  I really like the juxtaposition of presenting and vindicating Commonplace's arguments while also showing just how monstrous they're willing to be in pursuit of their goals. The fact that Commonplace was willing to murder an innocent girl and then *replace her* is horrifying, but she wouldn't have died if Isaac Brin didn't come in with overwhelmingly and unnecessarily lethal force and then deny everyone but "Matilda" medical care. Commonplace's scheme wouldn't have worked if Paragon gave shit about Humdrums (I mean, they probably had contingency plans in place, but you get what I'm saying). It shows you why Commonplace exists and that there is a genuine need for what they're fighting for while also making you want them to fail, in this moment if not in the big picture.

  It really underlines a feeling I've had for... basically the whole book. I want Commonplace to win while also wanting Commonplace to lose. I want to see the world Commonplace is striving for come to be, but I don't want Commonplace to be a part of it. I want our protagonists to join Commonplace's *cause* without aiding it's *means*. 

  I really like that the story evokes this feeling, that the rebels and revolutionaries are dangerous and extremist in their methods rather than just being a plucky band of freedom fighters. It makes it feel more authentic and... relevant, I guess? Real revolutions are bloody, messy, violent affairs, often seeing atrocities committed on both sides, and I'm glad the story isn't shying away from that.
