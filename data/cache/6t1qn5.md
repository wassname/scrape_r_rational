## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  Having finished the first half/season of the webcomic [Always Human](http://www.webtoons.com/en/romance/always-human/1-i-guess-thats-why-i-admire-her/viewer?title_no=557&episode_no=1) after u/TimeWinders [recommendation](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6rrew4/monthly_recommendation_thread/dl9a7dc), I would like to sing the praises of it since I don't think they did it justice. The comic is about a lesbian romance in a transhumanist future where one of the girls has an immune disorder that keeps her from using nanotech mods and is a fantastic example of using a sci-fi senario as a metaphor for a real world situation.

  The story is about dating with a disability from the perspective of both partners and explores the insecurities both of them feel in their relationship as a result of that. Austen is driven to push past the limitations her disability places on her, which prevent her from using things like memory-enhancing mods that other students take for granted, but is battling self-loathing over the difficulty of doing so.

  Sunati first feels attracted to Austen because of her disability, admiring her courage and resolve in the face of adversity, but soon realizes that she's fetishizing Austen and has to figure out how to psychologically separate the girl from her disability while also questioning her own use of appearance-altering mods. Speaking as someone with a disability, both of these were handled beautifully and rationally.

  The best part of it all? These two *communicate*. It is fantastic to see a romantic drama where neither partner keeps secrets from the other and they always talk with each other about what they're thinking, but still see interesting conflicts develop because of their fears and insecurities. They're both good people who want to be better and are trying to do their best, only to face all-too-real challenges this situation presents.

  The artwork is beautifully abstract and colorful, sort of like a anime drawn completely with watercolors, and each chapter has some delightful background music to accompany it. I even think the atmosphere set by the surreal yet gorgeous imagery is supposed to be representative for the acceptance of LGBT people, but that's just a theory. So if you haven't checked this story out yet, I think it's definitely worth a look.

    I didn't really read this comment because the first few lines made me want to go and read the comic and I wanted to avoid spoilers.

    I've begun reading and I have to say this artstyle is *fucking amazing*.

    Back to binging I go!

    *GASP!*

    Ok. I've surfaced. I've read the entire comic and I must say I loved it. Like I really, really enjoyed it. It wasn't rational fiction per se but it definitely had a futuristic, transhuman-esque bent that a lot of us here appreciate. And the romance was very well done. It felt very realistic. 

    I also liked the size and the pacing. It was a way to spend a few hours and you got (in comic time) six months or so of a romantic slice of life tale. 

    The background music was also a very nice touch, though it was jarring to hit next and have the music suddenly cut as the next page loaded(which isn't the author's fault, obviously) so I had to mute it. But [there's a soundcloud link to the music that I plan to utilize heavily in the near future.](https://soundcloud.com/walkingnorth/sets)

    Overall, a very fun story. I'm happy I read it.

    I second this! I read it in one go after seeing it in the Monthly Recommendation thread and it was really lovely. The art style is beautiful and, yes, the romance is handled extremely well. There's no drama due to miscommunication like we often see, it's refreshing.

  First off: I'm switching my username from /u/callmebrotherg to /u/callmesalticidae, for silly personal reasons that I'll elaborate on in a post attached to this (so as to not get tangential). 

  I hope that retaining the "callmeX" formula will carry the idea across for people who don't read this. 

  In other news, my application for graduation has been reviewed and approved, and my transcript updated accordingly. I have graduated from Brigham Young University of Idaho and can say: 

  * I have a Bachelor's (Communication major/Advertising emphasis; Philosophy minor)
  * I am not a Mormon (anymore). 

  It is really, really nice to be able to say that, since BYU-I was a religious school where being on the outs with the Church could mean expulsion (or even expulsion plus a fight to get your transcripts in a timely manner). I had never been fond of that aspect of the school, especially since I was already an unorthodox Mormon when I went in, but my finances weren't great and I thought that I could stomach it in return for the low tuition that I would find at BYU-I. 

  Now that I can say, "I am not a Mormon," though, I'm wondering what I am. I know that labels aren't important and can even be detrimental and distracting, but I like to put things in boxes and the question is an interesting one. 

  I believe that there is a nonzero chance that we're existing in a simulation and/or that there may one day be, or already is (somewhere else in the universe), at least one artificial intelligence whose capabilities far outreach our own. Am I, then, actually an atheist? 

  One could argue that I am an atheist because I don't believe that the simulation-makers or the AI (currently existing or yet to be created) have spiritual bodies or are in any other way non-physical. However, as a Mormon I believed that God had a body of flesh and bones, and that spiritual substances were just another form of matter that we could not currently detect. This would mean that Mormons are atheists, which doesn't seem sound. 

  One could argue that I am an atheist because I believe that a superintelligent AI would still be bound by physical laws, and therefore an AI would not count as a god, but Mormons believe the same thing: God is limited by laws that preexist God's existence and, among other things, can neither create nor destroy matter. Again, it seems weird to say that Mormons are atheists, so I'm reluctant to claim that I am an atheist on this basis. 

  One could argue that my willingness to deal in probabilities, saying that we might not be living in a simulation, is a good basis for claiming that I'm an atheist. However, I've been couching things more or less in those terms for a long time, so this would mean that I've been an atheist since my mid-teens and that I was an atheist even during the years that I was praying to God. 

  We could say that the probabilities have to be high enough for me to be willing to act on them, but the simulation argument is mostly an academic one for me, and I'm not sure how my actions would be altered by it unless we made other assumptions (e.g. the simulation might be shut off unless we're entertaining, so my life should be made as exciting as possible for its makers). "What do I do if it's possible to create a superintelligent AI" is an easier question to answer, but if this is the deciding factor then it would mean that I could say, "I am atheist" one day and the next say, "I am not an atheist" because there is now a superintelligent AI running amok. 

  If we're in a simulation, then the beings who made it are apparently content to not interfere with us. If there is already a superintelligent AI somewhere in the universe, then either it has not reached us or it is not interfering with us. Either way, while we might use this as a basis to claim that I'm an atheist, there already exists a term for this: deism. And yet, one would not expect Eliezer Yudkowsky to begin describing himself as a deist were he to become convinced that we are living in a simulation. Maybe he'd be incorrect to not do so, but that's part of the question that I've been pondering lately and which I now pose to you: What am I, now that I am not a Mormon?

    **Boring stuff about my previous username and the new one, for those who are interested. This is mainly being written so my first post with this account has a clear link to my previous account.**

    The name "callmebrotherg" has apparently been interpreted by many people as "call me brotherg," but it was intended to be "call me brother g," as a nod to my religious convictions and the difficulty that most people encountered in trying to pronounce my last name. I was an unorthodox Mormon, to say the least, but I was devout in my own way and proud of those ties. 

    Increasingly, though, I don't feel good about those ties or the name that I chose to represent them. It might cause a small amount of confusion, but I've been considering this for the better part of a year and I'd really just like to leave the name behind. Even if nobody knew but myself, the name's meaning would still irritate, like a pebble lodged in my shoe. 

    I don't want to change my username again, so I spent much longer thinking about it than most people probably do. On a whim, I had slightly renamed the second edition of my Cyclopedia of Comparative Mythology, from Brother G's Cyclopedia to The Salt Cyclopedia. I'm not entirely sure why I chose "salt," but I was going to be selling this edition and I knew at this point that I wanted to be able to separate myself from "Brother G." Anything, even "salt" was better than that. 

    Not long after, I had to decide on a name for my publishing company in order to start releasing stuff on DriveThruRPG. I settled on "WMB Saltworks," referencing an old blog of mine (White Marble Block) and trying to make the "Salt" in Salt Cyclopedia mean something (Incidentally, I'd once considered an imprint called Glassworks years ago, for entirely different reasons). 

    I would have gone with /u/callmesalt at that point but my username had previously matched my gmail and I wanted that to continue, so I had to come up with something more because callmesalt@gmail.com was already taken. After spending far too much time on what was ultimately just some usernames and an email address, my girlfriend suggested Salticidae, a (taxonomic) family of spiders. In retrospect, this should have been obvious because I'm a big fan of Portia (a genus in that family) and am fond of spiders in general (though not as much as I am of birds, to be honest).

    Why did you leave the Church? My experience is primarily with Catholicism, and most people seem to just drift to the periphery and on out rather than actually deconvert for ideological reasons, but in your case it seems that you were going to BYU when you left and you are on /r/rational, so I'd be interested to see what your experience was.
    ```

    - u/callmesalticidae:
      ```
      Part of the Mormon experience is going on a two-year proselyting "mission." I started when I was twenty. I was kind of wishy-washy but I still believed (in my first six months I even wrote a small booklet about why God didn't care about homosexuality, with an analysis of every halfway-relevant verse in our scriptural canon, which is larger than the standard Christian set), and about six months in, I fell in with a crowd of...I'm not sure how to term them. "Fundamentalists" gives the wrong impression, "Literalists" is in ways correct but overall is probably the wrong term because I believed that (1) even our most prized scriptures could have been translated wrong and (2) it was all written by imperfect humans, who had definitely experienced the divine but didn't always know how to express it and, as well, sometimes had their own agenda or were otherwise Unreliable Narrators. 

      We took scripture *seriously.* Let's put it that way. Some of us *were* fundies, sure, but that wasn't our unifying characteristic. 

      Anyway, that's where I was at the end of my mission, believing that the prophets and apostles living today had seen Jesus face-to-face, that atoms were self-aware (hello, Brian Tomasik), and that even cockroaches had the spark of godhood in them. During this time I also became a hardcore pacifist and a socialist (the former died down quite a bit after my deconversion, since a large part of it had to do with God saying that pacifism was the way to go, but I'm still more socialist than not), and near the end of my mission (last six months or so) I got into Mormon Transhumanism, which is some pretty weird but neat stuff. 

      The problem with taking your religion really seriously, though, is that you can't keep doing that *and* ignore the problems that you notice. For people who were supposedly on first name terms with Jesus and God the Father, the Church's leaders were acting in some pretty un-Christlike ways. 

      General red flags included a slow drift away from the original doctrines of the Church in favor of becoming, basically, Weird Protestants; supporting various political causes that were totally at odds with Christ's teachings (hello, Iraq War); and spending millions of dollars on temples when people were starving to death. 

      These and other matters troubled me during my mission (and before, to be honest), and this only grew over time. The breaking point came when I found out that the Church ran a hunting ground that didn't just support itself but made money for the Church: the sin of Cain wasn't just murdering Abel but doing it to get Abel's flocks, or "spilling blood to make cash," to paraphrase a Hugh Nibley passage I can't remember word for word anymore. Now, the animals being slain here weren't people, so you might think that gave the Church a pass, but our earlier prophets (in modern times) had in no uncertain terms said that animals were important too. Several of them had even condemned sport hunting specifically. 

      It was as if the Catholic Church not only owned Playboy Magazine but had drifted so far over the past century that your average Catholic wouldn't understand why you were disturbed by this fact. Once upon a time we said that it was a sin to kill a fly if its only crime was being a nuisance, and now we were making money from the shedding of innocent blood. 

      My doubts had been growing up to that point, but that conclusively proved for me that the Church's truth claims couldn't be valid. They could not be currently led by God *and* be effectively profiting off of murder. 

      Other religions have ways to get around this, but it's a basic tenet of Mormonism that this is the last dispensation and that not only is this Church led by God, but it will never fade away or be corrupted like previous dispensations. This meant that if the current prophet was not led by God then the Church had *never* been led by God and Joseph Smith had not been visited by angels. If that was the case, though, then  the argument for e.g. Jesus looked thinner than it did the day before, because there was some stuff about Joseph Smith that *still* seems a little weird to me, and if that could pile up around a guy whose life was pretty well documented then who knows what was made up or exaggerated about somebody living two thousand years ago. 

      At this point, all my faith in God ultimately rested on Joseph Smith and the Book of Mormon. Here was some Weird Shit that couldn't be explained well except through the existence of the divine, you know? Except, once I saw how present-day Mormonism effectively refuted itself, it became apparent that I really just hadn't tried hard enough to explain the Weird Shit. 

      I'm not sure what I would have done without that experience. It was clear, at that point, that I was already performing some pretty amazing philosophical yoga moves, trying to bend the theology in all sorts of ways to keep it from contradiction either itself or what I knew scientifically, so there might have been a breaking point somewhere further down the line. On the other hand, maybe I would have just doubled down. 

      I tried to dodge the ethical concerns of supporting the Church by separating it from "the Gospel" or the doctrines and supporting only the latter, but the sport hunting thing just sent it all crashing down. If I had been, say, Jewish, I'd probably still be a Weird Theist (or at least Deist) because it wouldn't be as easy for me to come across a hard contradiction that sends the whole artifice falling down, and I was definitely suffering from motivated reasoning (I still haven't figured out how I'm going to explain this to my parents). 

      I really like Mormonism at its best. It's got some flaws, like various inaccurate truth claims, but it's earlier prophets had a top notch ethical system, at least in some places, and I have a soft spot for anybody, past or present, who tries to build a utopian community. Looking at Mormonism as it used to be, seeing how it is now, and being able to imagine how it might have been if events had gone differently, I'm still a little angry at everybody who decided to take the low road and turn the Church into what it is today. 

      This is already too long so I'm going to stop here, but feel free to ask for more detail about something. I'm having to type all this on my phone, so this might not be as coherent as I think it is.

        Thanks for answering me.

        As someone for whom typing on a phone is recently a necessity, I understand your concern but it came out well.

         It's interesting to see the progression from what looks like relative moderation, to literalism, and then to deconversion. I've seen that pattern before and I'm not sure why - perhaps people overcorrect for a perceived lack of personal commitment?

        That hunting range sounds really egregious. Any idea  how they officially justify it, if they bother?

        As to your family, good luck.

          Totally forgot the answer the second half of your post. Haha. 

          > That hunting range sounds really egregious. Any idea how they officially justify it, if they bother?

          There's no official justification that I've found (not that people haven't been trying to get a response) but in [this news article](http://www.deseretnews.com/article/770568/Tending-the-flock.html?pg=all), one of the people who manages the place has this to say: 

          > Hunting and guns are a big issue, and some people question whether hunting should even happen at all. But the fact is, there are between 14 and 18 million hunters in America, and many more than that number own guns. 

          /vomit 

          I just can't get over how the guy's response to "some people question whether hunting should even happen at all" is basically "well there are a lot of people who would pay for this, you know?" 

          At the close, the same guy remarks: 

          > Imagine if we got to the point that we could boost the price (of each permit) to $2,000 or $2,500. Times that by 250, and **it doesn't take a lot to understand that this could be a very profitable operation.**

          I feel like I've come to terms with the Church, but my blood still boils over a little at what this guy is saying. I spend two years of my life telling people that this is a good church, that it has some flaws but does more good than ill and that its leaders are ultimately inspired by God, and then I come home to find that the God that inspires them is Mammon. I can hardly believe it. 

          It isn't like the guy is a weird outlier whose views contrast with the official line, either. As the article says, "Church land managers see it as a legitimate way to make thousands of acres of land productive that would otherwise lie fallow for lack of water." 

          Fallow? *Fallow*? There couldn't possibly have been a desert ecosystem there that was already inhabiting this area, could there? This couldn't possibly be the Church whose prophet said that one of the most severe things we would be judged by is our treatment of the environment and of less powerful creatures, could it? 

          Well, I know the answer to one of those. It's the same church in name only. Nobody teaches these things anymore. 

          > As to your family, good luck.

          Thanks.

          I don't know why it happens in other religions but, according to my philosophy of religion professor, Mormons have a strong tendency to fall out of the faith and into atheism rather than into another religion. It probably has to do with the central place that modern-day prophets take in our doctrine: if you thought that Joseph Smith spoke to angels and translated scripture by the power of God but this was wrong, then that forces you to reevaluate more ancient holy men whose stories have had even more time to accrete details. 

          Serving a mission also gave me an interesting perspective on what it's like to be the holy man: even as a believer, it was weird for people to look at me like I had some sort of special relationship to the divine and to be looking to me for blessings and special guidance; and as an ex-believer, it's even weirder to think about what it was like in my head. 

          Anointing them with consecrated oil and laying my hands upon their heads, I pronounced blessings on the troubled and healed the sick. I cast demons out of haunted houses and walked without knowing where I was going, sure that God would get me to where I was supposed to be. 

          It's some freaking heady stuff, I have to tell you, and...I still miss it a little, just a tiny bit like how I imagine a recovering alcoholic still yearns for the drink. It gave me another perspective on what it's like to be one of a so-called prophet, demonstrating pretty clearly to me that good people can buy their own press and keep the story going. I wasn't even someone with millions of dollars at stake, just a rank-and-file missionary, but in retrospect I can clearly remember the ways that I would jump through hoops to avoid noticing the flaws and explain e.g. why someone wasn't being healed (and I remember the times when they thought they were doing better and would try to convince me, even though I personally wasn't sure). 

          I definitely have a God-shaped hole, but I'm not sure that it was always there. I don't think I had it when I was younger. More likely, it developed on my mission, back when I was really getting into this stuff. More reason to discourage people to play with religion, I guess.

          My Guess: Moderation becomes literalism due to in-group pressure. I've also seen it happen through a competition-like, "Who takes the bible the most seriously is the most righteous person" thing. 

          From there, literalism makes their belief more rigid. Convince a moderate that one of their beliefs is wrong, and you've changed that one belief. But since literalists link every one of their beliefs together, convince them that one belief is wrong can break their whole belief system.

          - u/callmesalticidae:

            The rigidity of literalism is definitely a factor. Not sure about other people, but personally I got there through a tendency to take ideas seriously and past the point where other people would call me nuts. Brian Tomasik feels like a kindred spirit in that regard.

        I never actually stopped being a spiritualist, but I can definitely relate to your experience here. The exact same beats happened with me and New Age, though it was primarily due to rationality making me realize the pseudoscience I associated with New Age was invalid so I reexamined the rest of my beliefs and realizing it was impossible to prove them to anyone who hadn't undergone my subjective experiences.

        I still believe in supernatural phenomena, because I'd rather not describe my meditation experiences of astral projection or communication with spirits as hallucinations, though I've disconnected those beliefs from my morals and am a deist in practice. I eventually concluded that I had a psychological need to believe in some form of religion and attempting to live as an atheist would only contribute to my depression.

        I'd be happy to discuss theology with you, though I can't claim that you'll find any of my experiences enlightening. I was brought up Catholic, but my Mom was super liberal and I *never cared* about church or scripture so converting to New Age felt like just worshipping God the way I always had been while encouraging me to explore other religions for useful ideas.

          I'm not sure that this is spot on for me, but it's definitely close to how it feels for me. I'm hoping that things might change now that I'm away from BYU-I and that, with other pressures relieved, this one might not be so burdensome, but I definitely have a God-shaped hole or hunger for ritual or whatever. Maybe I could try acid. >:P 

          I've got a few friends on Occult Marxist Tumblr and every so often I'm tempted to see if it's possible to fuse a little bit of that into atheism, sort of like a weird LARP or something, but...I am really attached to my identity as "Somebody whose base-level preference is to believe what is true rather than what feels good for whatever reason" and I'm a little worried that I might get sucked into the Religion Hole again if I don't stay away from it entirely. 

          I don't really know. On Tumblr, Tanadrin's mentioned that Sacred Harp helps to satisfy some atheists, and now that I'm in San Francisco I actually have the opportunity to check them out. I'd like to find a way to make symbols more meaningful again. 

          > I'd be happy to discuss theology with you, though I can't claim that you'll find any of my experiences enlightening.

          Nah, but it might be interesting. A bit of forewarning, though: Even as a Mormon, I tended to approach religion (mine and others') like I do a fictional world, asking what Y is implied by the existence of X and how, if at all, A and B can be reconciled with each other despite their apparent conflict because of some apparently insignificant but conflicting details. 

          I don't want to tick you off, so let me know ahead of time if that would bug you. It's more in the spirit of "fully exploring/investigating" than "debunking," though.

    "Brother G" kinda looked like it sounded like "brotheurgh", honestly. So yay!

    Also I think in my head "Mormons" are grouped with "Amish" as "these weird American Christian cults", and I'd be kind of hard-pressed to differentiate the two. Do Mormons often use computers?

    You're an atheist because you believe that, whatever 'God' or higher entity there may be, you have no moral duty to love it, and do and think as it wills. I believe the official name for that is 'Stargate Atheist'.

      Mormonism is large and heterogenous, unlike the Amish. The Amish and other Anabaptist groups don't use technology out of a desire for simple living (which manifests as an oddly specific tech level that includes modern metallurgy but I digress). Mormons have no such restriction, and I don't believe even the most extreme splinter groups like the polygamists have any prohibitions on computers.

      Well, they're definitely weird, and... "Cult" gets used an awful lot, but "spiritually abusive" probably does a better job of actually conveying useful information just because "cult" gets used so much, in so many ways. Especially after some of the leaks that have been dripping out for the past year or so, I'd say that Mormonism isn't too far off from being "Scientology with better PR."

        I meant it more as 'isolationist religion', but yeah, fair enough. (I like 'spiritually abusive' as a label, by the way)

        I don't remember Stargate that well and I may be projecting depth on it that it didn't have, but I think at least the Ori arc dealt with the fact that, no matter how real and omnipotent and godlike they were, worshiping them wasn't the right thing to do.

          No, no, I'm pretty sure that's correct. I read it as sort of an indictment against Islam in particular when I was watching it, but, um, that was back when I was a jingoistic neocon shitheaded teenager. 

          > I meant it more as 'isolationist religion'

          Oh, I see. I misunderstood. Yeah, Mormonism's weird. We try to be happy and welcoming, or at least claim to be, but when you get down to it we're pretty clannish and, as soon as we get the numbers to be in the majority, we'll shut you out faster than you can blink. 

          "No, Tommy, you can't play with those kids down the street because their parents aren't Mormons" is a story I came across too many times to count when I served as a missionary (I worked in and around the Salt Lake Valley, Mormon Central). 

          We do better when we don't have enough people to shut out everybody else and make our own community, but that's not exactly a ringing endorsement, is it? 

          I was hoping that things were going to get better, but the leadership of the Church recently declared that children whose parents were in a same-sex relationship would not be eligible for baptism until (1) they were adults and (2) effectively denounce their parents as no-good rotten sinners. Keeping in mind that we still baptize children whose parents are unwed (which is also a sin, and for the same reason, as it's a violation of the "law of chastity"), it looks pretty clearly like a move intended to exclude people who might grow up to be future troublemakers (a recent spat of excommunications has also suggested that the Church is no longer interested in real dialogue or change and would prefer to double down rather than adapt to the changing times).

            It's really kind of an indictment of organized religion altogether, but I would say it's aimed toward abrahamic faiths especially.

            Even fairly mainstream christian churches can get pretty into this isolationist religion game. The church my friend grew up in made a large and concerted effort to be the center of all its members' social lives, across every facet. Combine several services a week with several youth group sessions, add a (separate, in a strip mall down the street) coffee/book shop made and furnished to be a casual hangout, and special events to supplant common holidays, like a trunk-or-treat for Halloween, and you've got an insular, disconnected faith community right there in suburbia that looks almost like a normal church.

              Yeah. After knocking polytheism in the previous seasons (sure, the Asgard are goodniks, but they're still *not gods*), the focus on Abrahamic religions combines to make SG-1, in total, an indictment of religion (or at least god-following, since you could maybe make the case that New Age-y stuff is shown in a good light via the Ascended) in general.

                Well, in Atlantis, the ancients/ascended are largely shown to be somewhere between "gigantic dicks" and "absurdly, laughably irresponsible," often both at once. If the ascended are faeries, they're not the nice kind.

                > My church did this and I didn't think anything of it but now that you mention it, yeah, it feels pretty weird...

                Every action is calculated, with the same goal in mind: supplanting the victims' entire social network. And really, it's a pretty natural goal for the church, in many ways a return to an almost idealized-medieval-village social dynamic, little communities built around the church and led by the patriarch. It's just that that's a toxic fucking dynamic.

        - u/callmesalticidae:
          ```
          Well. They're mostly 18-20yo kids. I mean, they're legal adults, but most of them haven't had the opportunity to really examine things and, if they did, would be left out in the cold if they said anything. Just a few months ago some 18yo was abandoned by his family at a camping site after he admitted to having doubts; and there's an "Underground Handcart Company" whose volunteers try to arrange housing for people whose families cut them off. 

          Missionaries can be assholes, but anyone who's mean to them from the get-go, confusing these kids with the org that they represent, is not great stuff either. 

          (Also, missionaries can do some fine good work. There's stuff I did that I'm not proud of, what with convincing many people to take leaps of faith for an org that doesn't deserve it, but I also helped struggling families, oversaw addiction recovery, etc.)

          Having been a missionary, my preferred approach would be to let them know that the door is open, that I'm willing to give them some lemonade and a break from the hot sun (or whatever the SF variant would be), and that we can talk but they shouldn't expect a miracle out of me. 

          I'd love to give a few things for them to think about, but attempting a full deconversion in a limited time frame is too much to hope for, especially because going home early is one of the worst things that could happen to a young adult in the Church. 

          As a missionary, I often had to be content just with the knowledge that I was planting seeds that might be harvested later. I can think of no better-fitting tribute to my mission than to exercise that same patience once again. 

          Hell, for some of them, what they really need anyway is not a strong attempt at deconversion but a demonstration that "exmos" can be nice people.

  As promised, there is no code work progress. We’ve just gotten two out of the three rooms packed for our move, and fortunately the last one is mostly empty.  Tomorrow will be fun with getting the truck, consolidating boxes, and taking apart things that need taking apart.

  In the meantime, tho, we’ve been discussing a concept which may or may not make it into the game, but I feel ought to be explored, if for no other reason than to ensure that we don’t shoot ourselves in the foot and make it impossible to implement down the line.  The concept is what I’ve been calling “move crafting”.

  The idea goes like this: if Blaine, fire specialist extraordinaire, is handed a brand new charmander, then due to his long experience and expertise, he ought to be able to start teaching the newcomer Flamethrower, even though it has never seen the move demonstrated before.  It wouldn’t be as *easy* as demonstration, and there would be a decent rate of failure, but after a few days, Blaine ought to be able to have his new charmander spitting out a rudimentary fire no problem.  

  If Blaine is able to teach it a move that exists in the world and is defined in the game files, what would stop him from inventing a move wholesale and teaching that to his charmander?  As far as the charmander is concerned, the problem is the same: it sees no difference between a move that exists that it has never seen before and a move that doesn’t exist that it has never seen before.  

  Thus the idea of letting the player modify or completely invent entirely new moves.  This requires moves to be defined in a rather modular manner and encourages us to stop thinking of them as bundles of numeric stats and more of a nebulous object that has slots filled with metaphorical components.  

  I actually started with the concept of Eve Online’s ship fitting, where each ship has a limited number of high, medium, low, and rig slots, which number is defined by the ship.  Each ship also has a limited amount of CPU and Power that is consumed by the modules that the player inserts.  Different slot types have different roles, and some ships simply can’t accept certain modules of one class or another.

  The same basic idea can be applied to move definition, I think.  After iterating on the design for a while (and deciding I sadly I could not find a way to incorporate Firefall’s imo brilliant color system), this is what I’ve got:

  Basically, moves are defined in three groups of component: Requirements, Application, and Modifiers.

  Requirements include things like anatomy restrictions, typing restrictions, EV gates, and so forth. Each requirement increases the potential power output multiplier of a move, while each requirement *type* increases the difficulty multiplier of the move.

  Application defines the broad strokes of how the move interacts with the world.  Think of these as utility slots, things that crucially change the move beyond just being a damage amount. Targeting modes indicate how the user triggers the move (difficulty is increased sharply for each targeting mode beyond the first).  Effects that can be thought of as particles are defined, such as a gob of fire that deals X damage, lasts for Y seconds, and has Z% chance to burn.  Effect streams are like particle systems, in that they fire off the Effects in a given manner, such as Flamethrower being a simple constant stream of flame Effects.

  Modifiers are the finishing touches that differentiate a move from the templates that have so far been referenced.  Depending on what components have been defined in the Requirements and Applications, a certain number of free Modifier slots are opened up. Modifiers can be added without restriction, but those which do not have a free slot will engender steep penalties, including difficulty, endurance, and accuracy costs. In addition to OnUse, OnHit, and OnCrit effects, flat bonuses can be applied as modifiers (such as +damage or -end).


  As an example, here is a rough draft for how such a system would describe Flamethrower:


      Requirements:
      [Fire Type: 10%]
      [Anatomy: oil gland x1]
      [Fire EV: 500]
      [SPATK: 100]
      [Cost: END:50]
      [Cost: FAT:10]

      Application:
      [TargetMode: Unit]
      [TargetMode: Tile] 
      [InstanceTrigger: ProjectileStream 
          [Instance count: 50]
          [Instance rate: 10.0]
      ]
      [EffectInstance:
          [Type: Flame] 
          [Duration: 3.0]
          [Speed: 2.0]
          [Damage: 5]
      ]

      Modifiers:
      [ResourceSub Oil:10]
      [ResourceBonus damage:2.0 speed:2.0]
      [OnCrit: +25% burn chance]
      [StatScale: FireEV, +damage 0.1, +speed 0.1, +burn 0.1]
      [StatScale: SPATK, +damage 0.05, +acc 0.05]
      [MoveScale: -ResourceSub 0.001, -fat 0.01, +acc 0.01]

  This describes a move that requires an oil gland and can optionally be powered by oil from said gland, which reduces the effective endurance cost while doubling effectiveness in some areas.  For each Fire EV that the unit has, the move will have more damage, more speed, and more burn chance, while for each Flamethrower EV the move will use less oil, generate less fatigue, and be more accurate.

  Modders (and developers) would define moves this way with no restrictions on numbers and being able to override things like the total difficulty that is calculated from what components have been selected.  

  In-game, on the other hand, an aspiring move-theorycrafter would only be able to choose components from a limited set, and those too only of moves that the trainer has studied and understands well.  Thus a trainer might be able to take the Flamethrower projectile stream with an inverted speed, apply the particle lifetime and speed of Ember, and alter the resource consumption to match Consume, and boom:  they are the proud inventor of a newly minted Fire Fart move.  

  Players would have to spend time teaching and studying specific moves to expand their component library, and perhaps spend time trying to interact with well-known scholars in the field for juicy tidbits.  Move creation itself would be balanced more or less automatically, with higher power moves requiring more endurance use, having higher difficulty rates, lower accuracy, and other negative aspects that move design would have to effectively work around.  I would not want this to be a mandatory skill, nor one that turns into a sort of meta-programming, but I think it might turn out to be a potential solution to many problems, and a potential dedicated career path in itself.

  Thoughts?

  We’ll return next week with hopefully some actual game progress, but don’t hold your breath too hard.  I will after all be wiped from the new move, so we’ll see what happens.
