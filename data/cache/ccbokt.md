## [D] Mother of Learning - finale predictions? [Spoilers All]

### Post:

First off, thanks everyone for clarifying the rules re: teleportation for me.

&#x200B;

I'm finally caught up, and I'm a little sad I missed some of the live discussions for such a great work! I'm interested to see what predictions ya'll have, both positive and negative, since by the author's estimates we're in the last handful of chapters.

\[High/Med/Low\] = Confidence level

* \[High\] Zorian's going to use his one hundred telepathy relays to construct a city-wide illusion that he died for Zach. Zach won't believe it at first, but Haslhush will present Zach a letter from Zorian that spells out why it was necessary and that he went into the battle knowing he would die, that he'd rather die than Zach, etc. Only then will Zach fully believe it.
* \[Med-High\] They will not permanently kill QI. There's been very little discussion into finding his phylactery, other than "we have more important things to worry about." Plus, given that nobody103 has indicated that he may write a sequel, QI is a natural villain that ZZ could work against without the aid of time magics.
* \[Med\] Bryn's going to get a Crowning Moment of Awesome with his firedrake - reminiscent of Neville cutting off the head to Voldy's snake.
* \[Med\] Someone emotionally close to Zorian will die, and it's probably going to be Taiven. She's died in most of the loop-restarts where she participated in the final battle, I think, so it fits.
* \[Med\] In line with the above, at least one of Zorian's mentors will die. Probably Xvim or Ilsa.
* \[Med\] Kirielle will be kidnapped by RR at some point in the encounter - she may already have been. There's been more than one mention since Zorian exited the time loop about how dangerous it would be to have her in Cyoria.
* \[Low-Med\] There is another method to summoning Panaxeth that neither Zorian or Zach are aware of, but RR has been keeping a secret just in case ZZ save all the shifter children.
* \[Low\] Zorian will suffer some type of permanent magical disability from the fight, owing to the angels trying to curb some of their influence in the world. Mostly this prediction is predicated by Zorian's foreshadowing in one of the recent chapters about how convenient it'd be for the angels if he and Zach died.
* \[Low\] Both RR and Silverlake will survive the immediate battle, and one or both of them will enact some type of permanent long-lasting damage to Zach or Zorian before the month ends and Panaxeth kills them.

    In one of the patreon posts, he said that he’s considering writing a sequel. But it’ll be more of a “fourth arc” exploring the aftermath of MoL. Less grandiose plot.

        Fair enough - clarified the language. Though, it doesn’t change my point, since if he’s considering writing a sequel it makes sense for him to do some groundwork for it in MoL, regardless of whether he goes through with it or not.

  In Red Robe's dying moments being stuck a final blow by Zorian, he is going to reveal he was Fortov all along or he will reveal himself as Fortov earlier in the battle.

  Byrn Ivarin is the random first year Zorian met on the train, whose mother is a librarian. You're talking about Briam and his newly bound fire drake Trogmar.

    Great, thanks. Quick glancing over it seems like most people agree that Zorian mind magic on Zach is a certainty, though I think now we have more evidence to believe it's going to be an illusion of some kind. Also see that I'm not the only one who places a medium to high confidence that QI is going to survive.

  Non-loop Silverlake will show up to fight on the side of ZZ, as a freed primordial does not help her in any way and ZZ can bribe her with youth pot ingredients.

  Are you taking bets on any of these? In particular, some predictions feel oddly specific.

    Happy to take a bet or two for charity. What did you have in mind?

  Noooooo.

  I am very much a Zorian/Taiven shipper (even if only platonically), over any of the other possibilities. I really don't want her to die.

  >* [Med] Bryn's going to get a Crowning Moment of Awesome with his firedrake - reminiscent of Neville cutting off the head to Voldy's snake.

  Imo, the firedrake's already has its moment against Veyers. It probably won't have another one.

  >* [Med] In line with the above, at least one of Zorian's mentors will die. Probably Xvim or Ilsa.

  :/ Narratively, probably Xvim, but at the same time, he's more competent. But at the same time, he knows about the loop and is facing the upper tier mages. Eh.

  With an author like nobody103, it's hard to predict what exactly is going to happen, though it will seem obvious in hindsight. Typically, there's always a spin the reader doesn't guess. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

  - u/DamenDome:
    ```
    I agree with Taiven! I just think it's one of the only people that if they die will *really* fuck Zorian up, and with his internal monologue about whether she should participate or not makes me think there's a high chance he's going to regret letting her. 

    &#x200B;

    Great point re: Bryn. I hadn't thought about it like that, but you're right. I'd revise that to a \[Low\] confidence prediction.

      I also don't think Bryn is an important enough character for a moment of awesome to be necessary

        Maybe Kirielle will kick RR in the shin really hard

  Yea, I'm on board. I have a feeling nobody103 still has a card up his sleeve on this front, but I'm banking on a bait and switch.

  >[Med-High] They will not permanently kill QI. There's been very little discussion into finding his phylactery, other than "we have more important things to worry about." Plus, given that nobody103 has indicated that he may write a sequel, QI is a natural villain that ZZ could work against without the aid of time magics.

  I have a feeling they will destroy him during combat, the conclusion will roll out LoR style, and then right there at the very end there will be one last ominous paragraph on how IQ is still alive and makes plans to go after of Zach & Zorian.

  >[Med] Bryn's going to get a Crowning Moment of Awesome with his firedrake - reminiscent of Neville cutting off the head to Voldy's snake.

  I kinda doubt it, considering the scale of everything going on. I doubt very much he and the salamander could do much even with the right conditions. But that would be one hell of a moment.

  >[Med] Someone emotionally close to Zorian will die, and it's probably going to be Taiven. She's died in most of the loop-restarts where she participated in the final battle, I think, so it fits.

  I would hate to be right, but I'm betting on Kirielle. During the time loop we found out a lot about her in bits and pieces and she was one of the characters that hanged the most with Zorian without having to do with the main plot. Zorian warmed up to her after finding why she always wanted to hang out with him, and we had one scene immediately after he came back about protecting her and one more when we find out RR&Co. were planning to ambush Zorian's family. If someone is gonna pull the feels strings, it's her.

  >[Med] In line with the above, at least one of Zorian's mentors will die. Probably Xvim or Ilsa.

  I'm betting on both.

  >[Med] Kirielle will be kidnapped by RR at some point in the encounter - she may already have been. There's been more than one mention since Zorian exited the time loop about how dangerous it would be to have her in Cyoria.

  See above.

  >[Low-Med] There is another method to summoning Panaxeth that neither Zorian or Zach are aware of, but RR has been keeping a secret just in case ZZ save all the shifter children.

  I'm very much waiting for the giant curveball that will sidestep all their preparations. Either that or a Xanatos Speed Chess Gambit Pileup.

  >[Low] Zorian will suffer some type of permanent magical disability from the fight, owing to the angels trying to curb some of their influence in the world. Mostly this prediction is predicated by Zorian's foreshadowing in one of the recent chapters about how convenient it'd be for the angels if he and Zach died.

  I'm thinking the moment that they win, the angels will try to tie the loose ends and Zarch & Zorian will have to find a way to stalemate them into a non aggression deal.

  >[Low] Both RR and Silverlake will survive the immediate battle, and one or both of them will enact some type of permanent long-lasting damage to Zach or Zorian before the month ends and Panaxeth kills them.

  If this is to happen, I'm betting on the crippling being during the situation I mentioned on the point above.

  >.

  One more: I'm predicting we will find out how divine magic, and by extension angels and primordials work and there will be a surprise there.
