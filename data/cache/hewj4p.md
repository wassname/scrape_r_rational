  EDIT: I love it. My favourite part was the paragraph describing in detail the "cheeks of lush green chub" and the "hole from which shades of green gradually bled into blackness the deeper was ventured". 10/10

    Thank you! I'm mostly accustomed to writing in situations where I'm expected to be as concise and mechanical as I can manage, so it's a fun excuse to go heavy on prose.

  I'm a professional technical writer of many years with close to no experience in writing, but ample experience in reading, fiction. I want to branch into it, so I decided I would write some fanfiction in order to practice. I discovered rational fiction near the start of the year and have been obsessed with it since, and I thought an attempt at writing a rational story myself would serve my needs well.

  Criticism in any remotely productive form is sincerely appreciated, especially from other writers.

  Story Synopsis, as seen on AO3: 

  Nearly fifty years have passed since Shrek first braved the Dragon's Keep. Now a grandfather of six and far into his seventh decade, he enjoys a peaceful, contemplative retirement in his swamp with Fiona, no enemies having troubled him since his defeat of Rumpelstiltskin. His tranquil existence is interrupted, his true love and family frozen in their sleep, an unnamed foe demanding retribution for Shrek's crimes. Together with Donkey and Puss, he must embark on his last quest.

    It's caught my interest, but you should know you've marked this as having 1/1 chapters instead of 1/?, which is going to make people think it's complete. Which, as the story stands, makes it look pretty dark!

      I've fixed it. Thank you.

    I like your characterization of Shrek.  He still feels recognizably the same character that we saw in the movies, just a little more intelligent.

    My impression as a whole of this first chapter is "meandering."  It takes place in four different time periods: when the mob attacks, then a flash back to when he got the sorcerer's books, forward into grandpa-Shrek period, which I assume is the "present" for this tale, then back a week, and finally back to the present.  It's a little much, especially given that the mechanics of his fart attacks aren't really relevant to plot or setting or theme or character just yet; they establish a mood, but not, I think, the mood that you're going for.

    In addition, the timeline is a bit confusing.  You can sort it out in hindsight, but there's nothing in the mob attack scene to establish when it's taking place, so the impression from someone (e.g. me) who is coming in, just having read the synopsis, is that this is "old Shrek" being attacked by the mob.  I had to read it several times in order to get the proper sequence of events (mob attack: 30 y.o. Shrek; sorcerer's books: probably teenage Shrek; last scene: grandpa-Shrek).

    Finally: as this is a first chapter, I obviously don't have much information about where this is going, but I get the impression that the ending of this chapter is supposed to be a gut-punch.  The problem is, we don't spend enough time with Fiona in this chapter for the punch to have any force behind it.  There is the conversation with Fergus, that Shrek doesn't even react to, much less take part in, a single paragraph about how Fiona is important to him, and then the wham line at the end.  I get that fanfiction necessarily is going to rely somewhat on assumed empathy, based on the reader's pre-existing connection to the characters that was established in the original work, but you would need to spend some more time re-establishing the connection between these characters, if you want the act of tearing it away to have any particular weight to it.  That goes double when so much time has passed since the original work, and the relationship will necessarily have changed in the decades since we last saw them.

    I'm definitely interested to see where this goes, but I really think that you missed a chance to have me *emotionally invested* in where this goes, instead using that chance to explore the disgusting biology of ogre farts.

    Edit to add:  That said, I *love* the world building of the disgusting biology of ogre farts; I just don't think it's well-suited to a chapter building up to the conclusion that this chapter has.

        If that's what the author's going for, that sounds like a really interesting story concept that would be incredibly frustrating to read, to the point that I probably wouldn't.

      This was excellent and helpful critique, thank you.

    ```
    I think these two sentences need rewording/untangling:

    >The bodies as they were slayed all feelings of hunger.

    >His conclusion held the attachment responsible for the betrayal.
    ```

- u/nytelios:

  It's a shrektacular start. Shrek's his likeable, cheeky self and his predicament is sympathetic *and* a slick play on the title and pitchfork('s symbolism). Looking forward to Donkey & Puss, more *organic* exposition, dirty puns and subversive jokes that we can catch the drift of.

  Well, I tend not to read stories that don't exceed 100k words, but do know that you've earned my future interest.
