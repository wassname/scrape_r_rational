  Nicely tying together all of the little hints from the original HPMOR.

  Also: Man, fuck Merlin.

    ```
    When an ultra-powerful, ultra-knowledgeable wizard *who probably designed magic* installs a rule that, for reasons unknown *to you*, prevents the wide dissemination of hypermagic, the rational reaction is not "man, fuck that guy", it's "I wonder what his reasons were".

    You're looking at all of the instances where the Interdict is inconvenient to Harry. What you aren't considering is all of the things that the Interdict is preventing, and which Harry would want to be prevented.

      > who probably designed magic

      Aside from this, I agree, as we have strong evidence that magic significantly predates Merlin, and was probably created in Atlantis, along with the soul.

      We also do not have any evidence that Merlin was ultra-knowledgeable in the grand sense, only that he knew rather more than modern people on some subjects, and less than Harry on at least one other.

      That the *Interdict* exists and may have some positive benefits does not mean that it does not also have negatives, nor that it was the best possible choice even from the perspective of Merlin. It seems to be, by itself, responsible for the descentionist turn of the modern magical world. That seems to be rather a large negative, and the fact that the world survived with magic for at least several thousand years before it was created (If we accept modern datings for Merlin and King Arthur as being in the 800's CE, and Atlantis being at the very least more than 1000 BCE) indicates that the 'wide dissemination of hypermagic' was not, at least, an existential risk, while permanent loss of higher magics *might be*.

        Do we actually have reason to believe that Atlantis had anything to do with anything? As I recall it was a hypothesis that HPMOR-Harry came up with in order to explain the fact that magic had characteristics of intelligent design, but he tagged it "Atlantis" simply because that was a long-lost magical civilization that he'd recently heard of, not because he had evidence in that direction. It could just as easily have been Hyperboria, or Martians, or even Merlin for all we know.
        ```

          ```
          Dumbledore and McGonnagal make reference to "Atlantis" and its being "torn out of Time".
          ```

          - u/eaglejarl:
            ```
            Yes, that's what I meant by "recently heard of". Do we have any reason to believe that Atlantis was more than just another magical civilization?  To believe, specifically, that it was the *cause* of magic?
            ```

      ```
      You are also looking at magic getting lost all the time. That's something Harry would also want to be prevented. I think he should look at the interdict more closely.
      ```
