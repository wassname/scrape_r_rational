## Exhalationâ€”"It has long been said that air (which others call argon) is the source of life. This is not in fact the case, and I engrave these words to describe how I came to understand the true source of life and, as a corollary, the means by which life will one day end."

  This was the first thing I've ever read of Ted Chiang. And has remained my favourite of his.

  >!You, I hope, are one of those explorers. You, I hope, found these sheets of copper and deciphered the words engraved on their surfaces. And whether or not your brain is impelled by the air that once impelled mine, through the act of reading my words, the patterns that form your thoughts become an imitation of the patterns that once formed mine. And in that way I live again, through you. !<

  This is so beautiful..

  Wow, this is pretty amazing. Never seen the inevitability of entropy explored in a non-space setting before.
