## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  I've always liked stories where the protagonist wins by using common sense or unusual solutions that obviously never occurred to others but seem more obvious in retrospect. Anyone have any recommendations for stories or media where the protagonist wins or changes the story through some outside the box tactic or common sense solution that others have never tried or thought of?

    *Luminosity* features a protagonist who *thinks* she's doing this.  

    She's wrong, and it goes correspondingly badly (which is the most common outcome IRL).

      ```
      To be fair, I'd argue she made the correct decision wrt what she knew at the time. >!Preventing genocide!< is generally considered a good thing to try and do, even if looking back later there were better paths. For what she did know, the risk of >!The Quileute Tribe be killed as soon as Aro remembered werewolves!< was huge.

      There's also the fact that >!hidding the existance of werewolves!< would likely have been justification enough for >!the imperial coven to capture the vampires for power bottling!<  as they did anyways.
      ```

      - u/PeridexisErrant:

        There were also *huge* risks to unilateral action, which she knew were large but knew nothing else about.  She could also infer from the lack of catastrophe to date that it was probably not urgent.

        Her goals were noble, her actions reckless.  I do not count it as the correct decision.
        ```

        - u/fljared:
          ```
          There were risks however she ran her plan. The only safe option, as far as she knew, was to continue to be an immortal and ignore the deaths of thousands of humans forever.
          Any action would have to be unilateral because of Aro. The only other option was to trigger an uprising early, for which she had no convincing arguments before discovering the >!kidnapped piles of vampires!<
          ```

          > There were also huge risks to unilateral action, which she knew were large but knew nothing else about. 

          Sure, but she is a teenager. Her brain is still in the middle of rewiring itself, which affects her decision-making and risk-analysis abilities. The details are still somewhat unclear, but it is [well established that](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3621648/):

          > with an immature prefrontal cortex, even if adolescents understand that something is dangerous, they may still engage in such risky behavior.

          Overall I thought that she was a very good example of a "high INT low-ish WIS" teenage protagonist.

    Probably not what you want, but the only scenario type where that actually happened IRL.

  I've been reading [*Descendants of a Dead Earth*](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/30309/descendants-of-a-dead-earth) and I'd give it a cautious recommend. It's been out for awhile, and the author's on their third book of the series - 110 chapter written so far, updates are every 1-2 days.

  > In the future, Man has traveled the Cosmos.
  > 
  > In the future, Man has discovered many other races.
  > 
  > In the future...Man has no home.
  > 
  > 200 years after the great war that destroyed Earth, humanity struggles to survive; fractured, divided, wanted by no one.
  > 
  > Until Maggie, of the Tinker Clan, makes a discovery, setting in motion a chain of events that could change *everything*.

  The style is okay. There are a few parts where dialogue is a bit off, and character interactions are exaggerated, but that just might be my preferences. No grammatical mistakes (that I can remember). Worldbuilding is pretty good, with a focus on the MC overcoming adversity using her skills, knowledge, and limited resources.

  e: After finishing the first book, I have to revise this review a bit: the dialogue between the ships crew just isn't great. It seems that characters mainly have two settings: angry and smug. It just doesn't feel genuine.

  ---

  [*Peculiar Soul*](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/42433/peculiar-soul) by TMarkos (who wrote *Grand Design* and *Inheritors of Eschaton*, which are two other really good stories) is a new story that came out a month ago. It only has 6 chapter up and updates weekly, but what I've read so far is really interesting. 

  >Not everyone gets a soul.  The rise of industry and mechanization has sent the world's population booming upward, striving relentlessly for the fixed handful of souls that level armies and steer the fate of nations.  The remnants of a crumbled empire fight in a grinding, bloody war against their ancient enemy.

  >Not everyone gets a soul, but Michael must - for he is the scion of a lord, and the soulless cannot hold such a title.  For five years he has tried to tempt one of the souls freed by its vessel's death.  Five years of pain and failure, earning only his father's contempt.  At last, one more opportunity to earn his soul has come.

  It's well-written, the characters and story are interesting, the author does a good job of examining character and motivation, but the focus on worldbuilding is what I like best. It feels really fleshed out (or as much as it can be given the few chapters), not just the setting but the history and political climate, and how that feeds into the MC's story.

    To answer your question, I think you’ve hit the main ones I’m aware of. I seem to recall HP fanfic playing with canon’s memory charms—I’ll see if I can find any links later when I’m off work.

    Arguably a similar effect can be achieved through messing with time. JoJo has season 4’s >!time reset when certain information becomes known!<, and of course King Crimson. Though it’s anime and not rationalfic, so I don’t think it’s applied all that consistently. Worth the Candle has some of this flavor as well via Unicorns and the Infinite Library.

  I'm interested in far-future sci-fi stories set in deep space and centred around weird metaphysical/religious/supernatural bullshit. Ideally horror, ideally hard sci-fi.

  Examples:

  * [*Blindsight*](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/48484) *mostly* fits.  
  *  [*hollow hill archives*](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/hollow-hill-archives-teletubbies.69481/), a *Teletubbies* fanfiction (sic).  
  * [*Event Horizon*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_Horizon_(film\)), a movie.  
  * [*Hellpoint*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/628670/Hellpoint/), a video game.

    Its definitely not hard sci-fi, but there's *Space Runaway Ideon*, which I think is essentially Lovecraftian horror. Particularly the two films *A Contact* (which is an improved retelling of the series) and *Be Invoked* (which is a continuation/ending and the more interesting of the two). Skip the series unless you have a lot of patience- though I think its been unfairly mocked. Many of Tomino's works could be called pseudo-horror metaphysical weirdness, like that ending of *Zeta Gundam*.

    *Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri*? I was pretty freaked out when >!the planet literally talked to me incoherently.!< There's some stuff about "transcendence" that I never played long enough to get to but the writing is top notch. I suppose its not exactly horror.
    ```

    - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
      ```
      The thing I hate about *Alpha Centauri* is that it sounds like such a cool game, but I never got into it in its time, and now its looks only make my eyes bleed. I'm in no way a graphics snob, I love pixel art, there's SNES era games that still look amazing, but there's also some kind of uncanny valley during the 1990s in which games started growing really complex and ambitious while also still lacking the full technical means to properly conveying that complexity visually and the result is a lot of very terrible looking interfaces.

      BTW speaking of transcendence and such, *Stellaris* does a lot of things along those lines. Almost all end game events tend to be really terrifying shit, like >!extragalactic all-devouring aliens arrive!< or >!mysterious entities bleed out of hyperspace after you performed one too many jumps!<. And then there's the event where >!after getting in touch with beings from other dimensions, one of them offers you a Faustian bargain in which your civilisation gets a short amount of enormous power, and after that's run out the entity simply kills everyone and leaves you only with one planet and a few pops!< .

        There's something about the art style that grows on you (or at least, me). Building a base on a mineral-rich lake with those sea-grass things can feel profoundly serene. Or the way mind worms splat, accompanied by that squishing sound and the message about planetpearls. And the overall intellectual-brooding feel of it- the photos, that [dissent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwqN3Ur-wP0) (spoilers) cutscene...

        I feel the same way about another 90's game, Starcraft. SC2 has its charms, but somehow SC1 made the Zerg feel beautiful while you're actually playing them.

  I read the latest Bujold novel, a Penric one. The Assassin of Thasalos.

  It was very good! It's certainly not rationalist fiction, but the worldbuilding is far more real-feeling (to me, at least) than the vast majority of stuff I read. She has a real talent at... well, at everything. She's Bujold.

  Penric remains one of my favorite protagonists, though he's not nearly at Ista's level (the protagonist of Paladin of Souls, book two in the Chalion duology, by Bujold as well). Desdemona remains the best demon ever to ride shotgun in a POV character's head, and the Bastard is pretty great.

  As always, I adore Byzantine politics, and our return to Thasalos does not disappoint in its delivery.

  Highly recommended, read the whole series, it's an absolute delight.

      For those who wonder: that’s barely a spoiler. It’s revealed in the first few chapters of the first book (IIRC).

(If you read pretty much anything about the movie, that will not be a spoiler.)

      I like the Merchant Princes series a lot, and I’ve read it a few times. The final book should be coming out [September 28, 2021](http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2021/01/a-quick-infomercial.html).

    I mean, the amount of existential mindfuckery implied simply by the fact that you can travel to the past *and change it* is enough to make those implications far less than clear. Either:

    - time loops are a thing, the past is unchangeable and self-consistent, and therefore if you try you know you *will* fail, aka probably get killed, or,

    - a multiverse of timelines exists, in which case, sure, go ahead, improve this one, there's still untold trillions out there in which everyone is suffering the worst possible fates imaginable, also that awaits you too in the future because quantum immortality, have fun, or,

    - there's only one timeline and you can change it, which means that even by improving the lives of those in the time you've arrived in, you're virtually killing everyone who was ever born *after* it and up to your own time. Including all your family and friends. And it's unclear how do *you* even exist at all.

    Predestination. Not specifically about scientific or social progress, but definitely about saving lives using time travel. 

    Overall an absolutely fantastic movie. Certainly the best movie about time travel to go in blind, not knowing anything about it, not even that it's about time travel. I wish I'd done that, but I was interested in it specifically because I'm a fan of the original story it's based on (all you zombies by Heinlein).

  Recs for Low Fantasy and Hard Sci-fi? Webseries are welcome, fanfics too if they are really really good, but I'm looking more for published books. The more rational the better. Doesn't have to be gritty, but it's a preference of mine. Blindsight already on list.

    Hard sci-fi:

    Reynold’s *Revelation Space* and sequels. I’m working through the second now. A grimy, used future civilization has one question: why have they only found the ruins of alien civilizations?

    *The Three body problem* by cixin Liu. Series begins 20 minutes into the future but gets weird, especially in the second book. Occupies a weird space between hard and soft sci fi. Very focused on rationalist topics like x-risk and game theory.

    ———

    Low fantasy: 

    Glen Cook’s *Black Company.* Mercenaries end up working for less than savory employers. Magic shows up but it is rare, focused on trickery for anyone who isn’t top tier in firepower, and tends towards the macabre. This series founded a lot of tropes in later fantasy like Malazan.

    *The darkness that comes before,* first in R Scott Bakker’s *Prince of Nothing* series: incredibly dark low fantasy. The pope calls for a holy war, and the faithful answer. But one character has other plans, and given that >!he is basically a Dune Mentat,!< the world is not ready to deny him. Setting loosely echoes crusades-era Byzantium and Middle East, but is founded on some very different history and metaphysics, with sorcery and...other things. Definitely rational-adjacent. Again, extremely bleak and messed up.
    ```

    - u/WalterTFD:
      ```
      I'll echo the rec for Prince of Nothing.  Black Company isn't as bad as Malazan about grizzled veteran worship, but you can already see the first warning signs.

      3 Body Problem, I think, isn't really all that rationality adjacent, but it's got the spirit, at least.
      ```

      - u/netstack_:
        ```
        I was mixed on putting that statement for 3 body. It's got a lot of rationalist themes--humanity coming together to solve a problem, game theory, >!xeno-intelligence!<, >!xeno-game theory!<, cryonics, exotic modes of computing, and a lot more I'm sure I'm forgetting.

        And then it's just...not presented rationally? I think it's more in the plotting than in the reasoning. Characters do stuff that *feels* arbitrary, even if they can talk through a "rational" reason for it. Worldbuilding-wise a bunch of elements feel like they're in there for show (>!I sawed this cruise ship in half!!<), which is odd as the first book starts very similar to our reality. The plot is suffused with this weird sort of techno-authoritarianism that informs most of the evolution of the setting. Charismatic leaders draw together factions bound by philosophy instead of material interest, and when they fall, their ideology withers with them.

        It's fresh, it's strange, it deals in rationalist themes. I have to give it credit.

        =======
        also, re: prince of nothing. I haven't gotten around to reading past the first trilogy yet, but I was made aware of the big metaphysics reveal about >!damnation being real!<. It's a fascinating way to do it.
        ```

        - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
          ```
          Three Body Problem for me was a victim of "I made up a story in my head that was a lot more compelling than what I actually got" (at least the first book). See, >!when I started having the combination of physicists committing suicide, science experiments seemingly coming to a halt, and the whole strange simulation in the unstable star system, my thought was that the simulation was a metaphor for what was really happening, and that the reveal was that the lowest layer of the universe's law was purely chaotic; there were rules, but they interacted in such a way as to be incomputable, and so scientific advancement beyond a certain point was all but impossible.!<

          Then the later two books do indeed deal with some pretty grandiose and fascinating concepts, but they're also full of really dumb stuff. >!I can't get over the whole part where that guy imagines the perfect girlfriend, then has someone locate a woman that's actually like that and bring her to him, that was offensively idiotic. It's like someone who has never gotten laid and has the understanding of romance of a 12 year old went OK NOW PAUSE THE PLOT, IT'S WISH FULFILMENT TIME! !<
          ```

          - u/netstack_:
            ```
            Guh. I'd forgotten about that latter one. I only remembered the part where >!he becomes literally ill by drinking booze dredged up from the bottom of the ocean, just because it was expensive and rare!< I don't think it's ever even plot relevant again. It's like there's supposed to be a metaphor there but the author forgot to actually add it, so we're just left with the techno-authoritarian "I guess we have to have a Science Czar."

            As for the >!simulation!<, I liked that it mapped directly to >!the alien's home system and circumstances!<, but I remember being somewhat disappointed that >!the "solution" was just doing a big enough Monte Carlo sim. That's a matter of computing power rather than a novel insight, unless I'm forgetting something.!< Contrast OSC's *Xenocide*, which for all its faults, solves the main plot thread with a revelation about the in-universe metaphysics (>!the philotic "soul" enabling true FTL travel over the ansible network!<). Imagine if Ender and company had instead said >!"Of course! Have we tried sticking *more* engines on the spacecraft?!<

             The direction you mentioned does sound more compelling than what we got, though it would be pretty incompatible with the rest of the series.

            Also, I have picked up the habit of chanting "re-hy-drate. re-hy-drate." when I go downstairs to get a glass of water thanks to the VR game, so clearly that part stuck with me.

    Greg Egan is who I think of first when it comes to hard sci-fi, if you somehow haven't read any of him yet. Try Permutation City first.

    *The First Law* seems like it would probably appeal to you. I'm not sure exactly what you mean by "Low Fantasy", but it's a low-magic gritty-to-grimdark setting. *The Traitor Baru Cormorant* might also be up your alley. *A Deepness in the Sky* isn't quite hard SciFi (and it's a prequel to *A Fire Upon the Deep* which definitely isn't), but I recommend it highly to anyone reading SciFi. It stands alone well, thought there are definitely things you'll get better if you've read *Fire*.

    The Dresden Files -- urban fantasy about a hardboiled wizard detective, lots of fun, only vaguely rational but moreso than a lot of fantasy.

    Perilous Waif -- medium-hard scifi, lots of handwaving but no magic disguised as tech, trashy but fun

    Player of Games -- medium-hard scifi again, lots of other books in the same universe if you like it

    Crystal Society -- pretty hard scifi, extra rational

    Name of the Wind -- debatable whether it's low or high fantasy, but a big favorite among rational fiction fans.

    The Martian and/or Project Hail Mary -- probably already heard of these, but just in case, they're both excellent near-future hard scifi

        This subreddit's Wiki lists [Time Braid](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644) as one of "great and highly recommended stories that have a lot of qualities of rational/rationalist fiction". Which I mostly agree with except I'd like to add that the Wiki's content warning -- "Contains torture and mind rape" -- *really* needs to be taken seriously.

        One could argue that adding brainwashing, mind rape, etc to an infinite time loop story is one of the very few ways to introduce meaningful conflict to an environment where death just means an instant restart. However, the implementation was so brutal and visceral that it was something of a shock.

        The *Daniel Black* series is different. It's more of a "base building" game with an added harem. I thought that the base building part was OK if unexceptional while the harem part felt seriously off. (*Time Braid* also had harem elements, but they were overshadowed by the mind rape subplot.)

    pretty much everything Lois McMaster Bujold has written falls into one of those two categories, and all of it is super top notch. (well, OK, the Sharing Knife series is an exception.) For the SF, you can start with either Falling Free (heroic engineers! a dramatic take-the-thing-apart-and-put-it-back-together scene!) or Cordelia's Honor (romance! adventure! interstellar politics! the correct gift to come back from the rebelling city with!). For the fantasy, you start with Curse of Chalion.

    [Demense](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/40290/demesne) - more settlers/homesteading than kingdom building. Lots of focus on trying not to die to the elements/hunger/dragons.

You might want to read the original Youjo Senki (or the manga) since, while it's not crucial to the story, it helps with the background info.

  What's a good Sanderson series (or standalone book) for someone with no experience reading him? Preferably something on the shorter side.
  ```

  - u/Charlie___:
    ```
    Mistborn is a totally reasonable place to start. The novella The Emperor's Soul is also pretty good.
    ```

    - u/sprague-grundy:
      ```
      I would second this.  The novellas are shorter, but you're more likely to like Mistborn, and if you don't like it I think you can safely ignore the rest of Sanderson's stories.  A lot of people who don't like the novellas still like his longer stuff.
      ```

      - u/LazarusRises:

        Thirded. Mistborn, besides being fucking excellent, is a great intro to his style & universe.

  - u/TacticalTable:

    Warbreaker is free and relatively quick. Gets you a feel for his quirks, but it isn't really an awesome piece of writing imo.

  - u/Do_Not_Go_In_There:

    The Emperor's Soul. It's a short, nice story. It ~~isn't~~ is set in the Cosmere universe like most of his other work, but it's a stand-alone novella, and will give you a taste of how he writes.
    ```

  - u/degenerate__weeb:
    ```
    For his Cosmere works, the first Mistborn trilogy is probably the best start. Warbreaker is a solid standalone, but some people consider it to be slow.

    Sanderson and 'short' don't really mix, unless you're looking at his novellas. I'm not too familiar with those, though.
    ```

  - u/kraryal:
    ```
    A good, short novella is The Emperor's Soul. It's standalone, has a fun magic system with interesting implications, the characters are all smart and have competing agendas, there's a fair amount of intrigue. 

    I bought a copy and regularly re-read it.

  A couple days ago I watched "Freaks" (Canada, 2018 - to avoid confusion with the German 2020 movie of the same name) on Netflix. It was a very gripping take on a pretty classic setup (I'm not even going to mention *which* setup since finding out is part of the fun - though I would say it should become clear very early to anyone familiar with the tropes of the genre. Which genre? You'll realise soon enough). It's actually kinda hard to give any specific information since the movie starts with the premise of a little girl being kept at home by an overly protective, seemingly paranoid father, and moves from there as we discover and understand the situation following the child's own perspective. It's nothing groundbreaking, but makes for a really engaging watch, with some clever visual storytelling.

    Beneath the Dragon Eye Moons - A healer in a vaguely Roman fantasy litRPG.

    Beware of Chicken - At the same time the best Xianxia web serial and also the best satire/sendup of Xianxia.

    Only Villains Do That - antisocial dude transported to fantasy world as Dark Lord. Shenanigans, and character growth, ensue.

    The Daily Grind - Office job turns far more interesting when it turns out to contain a portal into a dungeon. Increases of skill and radical anarchistic politics ensue.

    I mean, a lot of the popular rationalist fiction around here is on royal road: Worth the Candle, Delve, Elemental Arena.

    I haven't read Blessed Time, so I'm not sure exactly what you are looking for.

    Personally I think Ar'Kendrithyst is one of the better written magic crafting novels on Royal Road that isn't regularly mentioned around here.
    ```

    - u/burnerpower:
      ```
      I see Ar'Kendrithyst mentioned all the time, but there is almost always a response post anti reccing it with almost as many up votes. Having not read it I can't verify the veracity of these anti-recs but I do think it's mentioned very often.
      ```

      - u/Mason-B:
        ```
        I guess I meant outside of recommendation posts! More like it's not elevated to the level of "broadly accepted fic people make top level posts about".

        I'll also admit that it isn't really *rationalist* so much as it is well thought out, the world has an appearance of being well developed and of appropriate scale, and the characters do often honestly pursue their goals, even if they are pretty stupid sometimes (though they often get called on it by other characters).

    [Here's a rec list](https://www.reddit.com/r/PracticalGuideToEvil/comments/m7a3jl/web_novels_of_similar_quality_to_guide_but/grc5gbp/) I wrote two months back. The last one on the list is the only one not on Royalroad. Other changes would be sticking Vigor Mortis on the list (I think that cropped up a few times in rec threads last month so check those recommendations out, personally I'm torn 50/50 on if it goes in the "Very Strong Recommendations" group or not), sticking Dear Spellbook on that list (basically "Mother of Learning but in a DND-esque world and about a 7/10 instead of a 9.5/10"), and sticking Only Villains Do That on the list (which someone else replied to this same comment with). Also Dead Tired is on hiatus right now, I guess the author is focusing on their other stuff, maybe skip it for now.

    Season 2 of Love, Death, & Robots is up. Not exactly a lot of rational stuff there, but it's a lot of fun. The exception is Life Hutch, which is both delicious and rational.
    ```

    - u/Dragongeek:
      ```
      I really like LDR too, but calling Life Hutch rational is a pretty big stretch. I mean...

       - A malfunction which causes a repair robot to suddenly become a killer robot is pretty unlikely
       - Said malfunction causes the robot to act like a Jurassic Park t-rex is even more unlikely 
       - Even if the robot is somehow thrown into a backup "combat mode", having it simply stomp on and smash anything that moves would be stupid, because it's very likely that it would break something that causes second-order movements and thus escalate the robot into a never-ending cycle of smashing things. 
       - The robot uses lidar or a similar technique to "see" as evidenced by its vision being a depth-map. It would not be distracted by a light source because light projected onto a surfaces is 2d and has no depth.
      ```

      - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
        ```
        Apparently Life Hutch is based on a pretty old story (from the 1950s/60s, not sure). The limited imagination about how robots and computers could work... shows.
        ```

      - u/Brell4Evar:

        My own fridge logic is that the bot was sabotaged. And yeah, the perception thing didn't make sense as shown.

        Those plot holes aside, it was a great survival story of a soldier using his tools and knowledge to beat the impossible.
