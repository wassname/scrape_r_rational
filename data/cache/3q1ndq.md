## [Q][HF][DC] (D&D) Why isn't every wizard aiming to become a lich?

### Post:

I'm talking high and hard fantasy, even taking into account [The Evil Overlord List](/http://www.eviloverlord.com/lists/overlord.html) and Rich Burlew's [Villain Workshop](/http://www.giantitp.com/articles/rTKEivnsYuZrh94H1Sn.html). But, to be clear, I'm not just talking about villains. *All* wizards (in D&D-style and derivatives).

*Any wizard* for whom acquisition of knowledge is a primary character trait should also be aiming for life extension for the continued pursuit of knowledge (and the pursuit of knowledge is one of the defining traits of D&D wizards anyway). Becoming a lich is an obvious step in life extension in this context, especially for any rational wizard that knows to hide their phylactery somewhere that isn't obvious.

(Competent) wizards tend to have much longer lifespans than others of their species, so the precedent is already there. But there's some sort of limit, because they do slowly age. Eventually, becoming undead is the obvious choice/*dead end*.

So what's stopping them from binding their souls (which demonstrably exist in-universe) to a physical object they can hide wherever they want so they can continue their studies of mind-breaking and world-bending magics?

There's nothing inherently evil about it, after all.

/edit 1: "I don't know what I get to keep going into the afterlife" is a known unknown sort of via *Planescape*

    Not bad. I'd add to their solution list the [Worm That Walks](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/epic/monsters/wormThatWalks.htm) template, a pretty good immortality solution in 3.5 - you basically become immortal by becoming a sentient hivemind comprised solely of bugs. 

    It initially looks like you'd have a chance of failure of becoming a worm that walks, but you just trade all your higher-level spells for a much huger number of spells of much lower level using Rary's Mnemonic Enhancer and drive the success percentage over 100% trivially pretty much any time you'd ever consider doing this (usually after you have level 17+ and therefore have already gotten level 9 spells). You have to be evil, and it's sort of gross, but you get pretty nice benefits.
    ```

    - u/eaglejarl:
      ```
      Yeah, that's both cool and gross.  Where does it say that you don't die of old age, though?
      ```

      - u/Escapement:
        ```
        There are no actual rules for swarms to age, nor for worms that walk to age. Thus your DM will probably have to houserule in any aging effects they want to impose on you. 

        From a watsonian point of view:

        Every time you discorporate into component parts you can reconstitute from even a single bug breeding back into a swarm eventaully. It seems difficult to show how you could meaningfully age and, say, lose STR or DEX or CON when every part of your consciousness is duplicated and distributed through a mass of insects, every single part of which is discardable and disposable - if you discard everything but bug N, breed back to a mass of bugs of size Z, then discard everything but bug M, and breed back to a mass of bugs of size Z again, everything you are presently constituted of is as young or younger than bug M, and therefore at most as old as the first time you discarded your mass of bugs. I think it'd be very difficult to reasonably in-universe portray them aging in any meaningful way. 

        From a doylist point of view:

        Age and aging tables come up so rarely in P&P sessions that most people forget they are thing that exists, and most DMs are very reluctant to make up a lot of houserules to institute aging rules that won't matter basically ever. DMs will never bother to houserule some in for your swarm form to nerf becoming a Worm That Walks, because it is a meaningless nerf that takes time and effort to implement for no reward. Unless you are having as part of your campaign plot something like thousands of years passing without anything noticeable happening and they really want your character to die over that time period, it just won't come up as a thing anyone will care about or worry about - and if a DM is determined to kill a character, that character will die, aging or no aging. If the thousand-year pause is a thing that is actually happening and will be coming up... then see if you and another player can arrange to Reincarnate (Druid 4) each other every 60 years or so - you can gain +3 to all mental stats for becoming venerable repeatedly, and so over thousands of years spiral off to having wisdom, intelligence, and charisma scores in the low hundreds fairly easily. No sense in not getting anything for your immortal time...

        --- 

        This junk is all theoretical optimization, of course, rather than something I'd advise for a real game. In reality, D&D stops meaningfully working and making sense as a game around level 9 to level 13, and when you are well into the 10+ levels you are probably playing more with houserules and mind-caulk than anything in the published books. Worms that Walks, lich transformation from Dread Necromancer, and a lot of other immortality options are **extremely** theoretical because the game stopped making sense without extensive and far-reaching houserules on a huge number of major issues long before they can possibly come up, so how they actually function in a real game will highly depend on what the real game actually is.

  - u/Quillwraith:
    ```
    The advantage of lichdom is that a phylactery makes you rather more immortal than mere undeath does. As a high level wizard, you won't be in danger often, but if you plan to live forever, the chance of misfortune adds up over time.
    ```

    - u/Uncaffeinated:
      ```
      It's really a question of PC or NPC. If you are a PC, then you really really really don't want to have level adjustment. From this perspective, Necropolitan is the only playable Undead race/template. If you're an NPC, then who cares? Your nature is dictated by the whims of the setting designer or DM anyway.

      Once you get into TO, it's irrelevant anyway, as there are better ways to protect against death. Like the Hide Life spell. Or if you want to really pull out all the stops, True Mind Switch into an Ice Assassin Aleax of yourself.

  > There's nothing inherently evil about it, after all.

  Uh. I feel like you don't know what a lich is? In both Pathfinder and D&D, the lich template says "any evil". In other words, becoming a lich literally changes your alignment (we can quibble about editions, since I know this is true in 3.5 but not 4.0 and have no idea whether they kept it for 5.0).

  So unless the pursuit of knowledge is not just a defining character trait but *the only thing a wizard cares about*, they can't become a lich without sacrificing their other values.

          If you haven't already, I'd check out [The Tome of Necromancy](http://www.dnd-wiki.org/wiki/Tome_of_Necromancy_%283.5e_Sourcebook%29), a splatbook which deconstructs the ambiguities and moralities of necromancy.

          >**The Morality of Necromancy: Black and Gray**

          >The rules of D&D attempt to be all things to all people, and unfortunately that just isn't possible if you're trying to make a system of objective morality. By trying to cater to two very different play styles as regards to the moral quandaries of the use of negative energy, the game ends up catering to neither – and this has been the cause of a great many arguments for which there actually are no possible resolutions. Ultimately therefore, it falls to every DM to determine whether in their game the powers of Necromancy are inherently evil, or merely extremely dangerous. That's a choice which must be made, and has far reaching implications throughout the game. That's an awful lot of work, and most DMs honestly just don't care enough to be bothered with it, and I understand. Fortunately, we have collated those changes for you right here:

          >**-Moral Option 1: The Crawling Darkness**

          >Many DMs will choose to have Negative Energy in general, and undead in particular, be inherently Evil. So much so that we can capitalize it: Evil. And say it again for emphasis: Evil. That means that when you cast a negative energy wave you are physically unleashing Evil onto the world. When you animate a corpse, you are creating a being whose singular purpose is to make moral choices which are objectionable on every level. 

          >That's a big commitment. It means that anyone using Inflict Wounds is an awful person, at least while they are doing it. The Plane of Negative Energy is in this model the source of all Evil, more so than the Abyss or Hell. It's Evil without an opinion, immorality in its purest most undiluted form.

          >**-Moral Option 2: Playing with Fire**

          >Many DMs will choose to have Negative Energy be a base physical property of the magical universe that the D&D characters live in – like extremes of Cold or Fire it is inimical to life, and it is ultimately no more mysterious than that. An animate skeleton is more disgusting and frightening to the average man than is a stone golem, but it's actually a less despicable act in the grand scheme of things because a golem requires the enslavement of an elemental spirit and a skeleton has no spirit at all. 

          >The Plane of Negative Energy in this model is precisely the same as all the other elemental planes: a dangerous environment that an unprotected human has no business going to.

          >**Implications**

          >It's not actually enough to simply make a sweeping generalization about the morality of Negative Energy and leave it at that. Like a butterfly flapping its wings, such changes will eventually cause Godzilla to destroy Tokyo. Or something like that, I stopped math at Calculus.

          >Some monsters have been written up with the (incorrect) assumption that either "The Crawling Darkness" or "Playing With Fire" was the general rule. Others have been written in such a fashion that is actually incompatible with any possible interpretation of morality in D&D.

          If the prospective Lich lives in the world of The Crawling Darkness, then Lichdom is an implicitly evil state of being, and becoming a Lich transforms you into an immoral actor. If they live in the world of Playing With Fire, then presumably Lichdom is *not* implicitly evil.

          The Evil alignment requirement for the Lich template would suggest that Crawling Darkness is the flavor of canonical DnD, but other templates and bits of lore cast aspersion on the idea.

  2 possibilities:

  &nbsp;

  1\. The lich-ification process involves an evil act that good characters are unwilling to perform (ala horcruxes in the HPverse)

  &nbsp;

  2\.  Good characters when they die go to a good-aligned plane where where they can continue their learning.  Evil characters go to an evil-aligned plane where they are tormented / interfered with / treated evilly.  Becoming a lich puts that off for a looooooong time.

- u/MaxMahem:

  So underlying this question is a kind of a variation of the [The Fermi Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox), in essence, if there are a lot of people raising their level over time, and at least some of these people transition into a immortal state, then where are all these people?

  Like the Fermi Paradox, there a lot of potential answers to this question, I'll propose a few.

  * There is no paradox, one of the suppositions is un-true. Perhaps not everyone aims to increase their level, transitions to an immortal state, or there has not been enough time elapsed. In other words, the number of immortal beings present does match the circumstances that cause their creation.
  * A preferred path to an immortal state removes the person from the equation. Immortal wizards seclude themselves in forgotten towers, remove themselves from the plane entirely, or transcend to some other state of existence.
  * Some variety of [The Great Filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Filter) exists which prevents persons from transitioning to an immortal state. Gods/Dragons preventing potential competitors? The transition to immortality having a low success rate? Simply very difficult to get high enough level to transition?

  As to the specific question at hand, "Why don't all wizards aim to be litches." I can think of three rather simple solutions.

  * Becoming a litch is a major project which requires a major investment of resources over the period of several years, and the success rate of transition is not necessarily that great. In addition existence as a litch might come with several important drawbacks, such as being hunted by heros, potential loss of your soul, ect. In short, wizard may do a cost-benefit analysis and decided that the effort necessary to attempt becoming a litch is not worth the cost.
  * There may be other routes to immortality with a more favorable cost-benefit analysis. For example a carefully crafted [Wish](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/wish.htm) for immortality might be possible.
  * Despite their generally high intelligence scores, all wizard might not in-fact act perfectly rationally at all times. Indeed in D&D 'intelligence,' the prime stat for a wizard, is generally associated with the mere accumulation of a large amount of knowledge. While wisdom is associated with the correct and efficient application of knowledge, which seems a better fit for rationality. So in short, while wizards as a class might be very smart, they are not necessarily very rational. This explains the existence of owlbears for example.

  If you definitely have a soul, and it isn't destroyed when you die, then why take the chance to mess with a *possible* life extension option when you already know you're going to exist, in some form or another, forever?

          I mean, if you're in the setting then you have strong evidence of the memory thing because of resurrection spells, and if you're not in that particular setting then the rules are different. Not knowing what the certainly existing afterlife is *like* is still a reason to put off dying, but you'll have plenty of intelligent people who decide to bet on the good gods not being douchebags to their followers after death. Granted I only really played 3.5, so I'm not a Planescape expert.

            I brought up *Planescape* to counter the proposition "you already know you're going to exist, in some form or another, forever" since the "acquire (and keep) knowledge" goal doesn't work in that magical afterlife context.

            Granted, at some point in the magical power scale towards becoming a lich one would probably manage to figure out precisely how the afterlife works.

- u/Farmerbob1:
  ```
  My first thought is that the cost of becoming a lich is too great.  Without knowing every way possible to become a lich, I can't justify that specifically.

  Perhaps a great many wizards do, indeed, attempt to find a way to become a lich without having to pay whatever cost is involved.  After several decades/centuries of research, some of them relent, and choose to pay the cost.  Others do not.

  As an example of the most likely cost?  In a world of the supernatural, it is common that when you take the shape of something, it changes you.  When you become a lich, you cease being a human, elf, hobbit, or whatever.  Your behavior changes.  Perhaps if you are extremely strong-willed, you can resist the changes for years, decades, or centuries, but eventually you fully become what you made yourself into.  At which point benevolent gods start nudging player character paladins and clerics to gather their buddies, and come hunting you.  When you are finally killed, your soul is either gone forever, or in the hands of some loathsome thing that proceeds to torment you for the rest of time.

    A rational lich does a better job of hiding its phylactery~

    Frankly, lichdom(?) is a rational way to "opt out" of the arbitrary magical afterlives.

    "I've never wanted to follow the rules of other people/beings. You're telling me the after-life I have to look forward to is a plane of *pure chaos* ruled (if that's the word) by caste-based lizard people and Gith-something? Pass, I'd rather stay here. For as long as I can manage."

  I had a 3.5ed D&D wizard character a little while back, and by the time I got up near epic levels I had reached a point where I had so many different magical options available that worrying about setting up any one specific means of immortality ahead of time was kind of pointless.

  In fact, for most of the campaign that character was actually *planning* to die as a means of accomplishing his goals. Near the end he suddenly discovered that his big plan had a flaw in it and hurriedly cobbled together a means of personal immortality as part of an impromptu plan B (it involved a mash-up of the druidic *reincarnate* and the wizard *clone* spells, and the primary purpose wasn't so much immortality as it was to play cosmic keep-away with his soul to ensure his enemies couldn't get ahold of it after he died or even figure out what had happened to it).

  I imagine that in a world where he hadn't been beset by powerful enemies and had just quietly worked away at his research he would have eventually looked up from his books, realized "oh, I'm 80 years old. I should do something about that" and taken a few months to develop some kind of solution to that problem. Lichdom has some downsides so he might have wound up picking something else.

- u/MrCogmor:
  ```
  D&D Settings have verifiable good afterlives and to get into them you need to have a good relationship with the more benevolent gods who tend to take a dim view on lichdom and undead. 

  In D&D you normally only become a lich if you already know you are going to a horrible afterlife.
  ```

- u/Grasmel:
  ```
  In 4e there's an epic destiny called Archlich, who doesn't have to be evil. The idea is that achieving lichdom is very hard, and most any lich you meet is going to have taken shortcuts by making deals with demonic powers or somesuch, corrupting them in the process (beyond how evil you have to be to make such a deal in the first place). It is possible to reach it on your own though, just much harder. Since everyone has an immortal soul, if they have reason to consider themselves good people they have reason to thing they will get into a good afterlife after they die, so unless you have a very important reasons to stay and the talent to make it so, you generally let yourself pass on. 

  As per the nature of DnD games, with differing edition rules and DM interpretation, it's very hard to determine what is canon and what is not. This is simple my view of the DnD world, with different things cherry picked so that the world makes the most sense given certain observations. I know that most liches are evil and good wizards don't generally try for it, and this is how I make sense of that.

- u/Geminii27:
  ```
  Life extension is not necessarily a strong enough desire in all possible wizards. Many people who are nearing the end of their natural life express desires for a *lack* of extension, for various reasons. While wizards might have a slightly higher percentage of life-extension seekers than the average population, there's no indication that it's actually common, particularly amongst the aged. And a much younger wizard might not want to give up their young, healthy, and capable human body for that of a lich.

    - u/Geminii27:

      In which case the answer becomes "Because the society they were raised in did not emphasize life extension, and they did not develop a personal philosophy which prioritized it sufficiently to undergo the process."

      Now if there was something about working with magic which made wizards increasingly rational, or the society where they grew up was one in which rationalist thinking was encouraged and lauded, then perhaps many more would take the lich option - particularly if others had gone before them and were still around to provide advice about the post-mortem experience.

    I disbelieve the category of unspeakable evils.

    Perhaps a better definition would be those evils where transmission of their description is an evil act. Although it would be interesting (to say the least) to try to define *those.*

          Well, summoning Murgoth, The Demon Who Eats Any Planet On Whom His Name Is Spoken, would be one such evil ... if he existed.
          Thankfully, the real demon has a different name.

          It's also possible that the ritual involves something so horrible that, in the process of describing it, you would accidentally imagine it and start screaming uncontrollably until you died of screaming uncontrollably. Unless you were Evil, in which case you'd just be mildly impressed.

            Woah there, son, triple-posting Murgoth's name summons him in the form of an autonomous paperclip factory.

    "Unspeakably evil" doesn't actually mean anything, ultimately. As you've partially demonstrated. There is no such thing as an "unspeakable evil" because someone will be fine with speaking about it.

    Baelnorns don't have to do any unspeakable acts, for instance. So the universe matters, perhaps. But it seems more like the inherent "evil" of necromancy adversely affected the concept of liches (not to mention that magical creatures generally [and in particular undead] exist to be adversaries).

    edit: [this would be unspeakably evil depending on setting, but obviously we can speak about it anyway](http://goo.gl/SCyxXl)

        Thank you. The actual link has parentheses and I decided to make the syntax easier on myself.

  Isn't there a chance that the potion to become a lich fails and just flat out kills you?  Seems really risky compared to elixirs of youth.

  Edit - Ah, looks like they took those out of 3rd and later editions.

  Better ways that don't hamper your growth in power with huge LA: go through a brief crucifixion to become necropolitan (make sure to take all your full-body painkillers beforehand and bring some nice music), become a ghost, become a saint, get perpetually reincarnated and gain eternal youth in the bargain, get a psion to true mind switch you with immortal being of choice. And then there is steal life on yourself: easily reversible stat drain, for permanent increase of lifespan.

  For protection from assaultive death: simulacra, device of contingent resurrection hidden like a phylactery with contingent teleport to that place placed on your body, soulbind your own soul into a gem and create copies of that gem before freeing yours through a dominated servant, use the mind-split trick to get multiple copies of yourself, get a psion to mind-swap you with a mindraped eternal blade's blade guide and become unkillable, mind-swap with a vestige that a dominated binder has summoned but not yet bound while it's standing in the runic circle, thus becoming an unkillable entity beyond space with time to think forever like Quirrell in that one story--and you can return by having the binder summon you again and cast mind-swap from a scroll. Once you tick 17, create a timeless demiplane and wirehead yourself with self-mindrape, thus gaining an infinity of time to own the universe your mind can conjure. The absolute best part is that mindrape does not restrict you to thoughts you already possess, so by strict reading there's no need to even arrange periodic info input, (if you care, which you do, you'll have to get a good élan or devil or something to write a very complex mindrape instruction with enough random seeds to last you a long while, though since high-level, non-technical language instructions contain a lot of complexity you can do pretty well just with those) which even though easy to do by specifying in the mindrape that you periodically cast Scholar's Touch on a book or dvd that a mind-raped servant brings to you, would inevitably create a weak link in your eternity (i.e. traceable transfer that could lead someone to your demiplane). However it's not a problem--it doesn't take much time, if you've set it up right, for your demiplane to spawn life that could create info (your demiplane can't contain rare elements, but you can sure as hell bring them in and magically multiply them, or fabricate them outright, with your own spells or those of mindraped servants) and it's growing all the time. So though there's a period of initial risk it will soon be self-sufficient and can recede into the astral mists.

  There are lots of other ways and these are by no guarantee the best and there might be mistakes. I'll try and look it up in more detail. Just IIRC.

  Inhabiting a rotting body probably hurts like a son of a bitch. If you don't start out evil, you're gonna be ornerier than a zombie wolverine by the time a few centuries have passed.

    Every implementation of "lich" I'm aware of is ultimately magically animated bones. Why include nerve attachments in the spell?

    For that matter, why maintain a primarily physical form at all? But that's a different question.

    - u/ArgentStonecutter:

      So what's the process of getting from living wizard to magically animated bones?
      ```

        ```
        Beats me. The process has always been deliberately obfuscated. But maintaining a connection to dead nerve endings doesn't seem like a useful thing that would be part of the process. Probably.

        Avoiding eternal phantom pain would be a valid and rational reason to not turn into a lich, though, I'll give you that.
