  I feel like Visser Three totally avoided reaching the most important conclusion due to a mental blindspot.

  Visser Three's prime motivating goal has always been preservation and persistence of his personal identity and sense of self.  This was why he always refused to return to a Yeerk pool like other yeerks - he didn't want any pieces added to or subtracted from his identity.  He wanted to remain himself, always, forever.

  Yet upon discovering drastic and radical changes to his identity and sense of self, which occurred without his prior notice, his main concern now is how it will impact his future plans and actions.  Rather than being alarmed at this failure in his foremost overarching aim, and re-evaluating on the basis of that failure.

  Visser Three cites "Know victory" as a central creed.  Yet he has lost, and still doesn't even notice that while he stares it in the face.

    > I feel like Visser Three totally avoided reaching the most important conclusion due to a mental blindspot.

    The intended interpretation is that this is a consequence of Alloran screwing with him.  I may have failed to write it elegantly enough for that to come clear, but yeah, V3 definitely making mistakes.
    ```

    - u/Alphanos:
      ```
      Oh, yes, I definitely thought that Alloran messing with him was the intended understanding, which even Visser Three realizes.  I wasn't clear if the mental sabotage was extensive enough to not only cause the identity shift, but prevent Esplin from being capable of properly analyzing and reasoning about it.
      ```

  Oh damn. As if one Visser Three wasn't bad enough. Now we have seven of them.

  I was surprised there was one on the Andalite home world. That seems like a bad sign for the Andalites, both that he was able to put a Visser there and that they now have a Visser there.

  I do wonder how well he's going to be able to collaborate with his duplicates. For now they have basically the same memories, but soon those will begin to diverge. For now he sees them as him, but that may not last. He's not even sure how well he can collaborate with *himself*.

  (I suppose that periodically having them all hang out together with a Leeran could help there, if they can arrange that in time.)

  Errata:

  > (Those being the ones which had not been vulnerable to straightforward splicing and reprogramming, and which now went dark and dormant, awaiting the Visser’s instructions.)

  I take it the ones that went dark and dormant were actually the ones that *had* been vulnerable?

    >That seems like a bad sign for the Andalites, both that he was able to put a Visser there and that they now have a Visser there.

    Worse than that, even. Just the fact that he *tried* is a bad sign. If he gets caught, that seems like a lot of important info that he's just given to the Andalites. So he's not gonna try unless he's confident that they won't catch him, at least not in a way that reveals anything he really doesn't want known.

  Okay, so, interesting (to me at least) hypothetical:

  How would you go about healing the Visser?

  Like, in Harry Potter canon, it's stated that feeling remorse for his actions would re-knit Voldemort's soul, and allow him a normal afterlife; in HPMOR, Harry concludes that Voldemort is utterly unafraid of redemption and not the least bit worried about it happening to him.

  But like say you had it as an instrumental goal to *fix* this guy, and return him to something like balanced self-actualization, as opposed to ... anxious megalomania?

  I'm mostly interested in theories of what specific fears or deficits he has, and what healthy mental structure would replace them, rather than answers like "go on a cruise and do a bunch of drugs."  Like, what do you see as his specific dysfunctions, in a clinical psychological sense, and how would they be meaningfully patched.

    So it feels like the biggest block in the way of a peaceful r!V3 is his megalomania/ego. He's actually *worse* than r!Voldemort because I could conceivably see r!V being content with true immortality and matching intellects to challenge/play with him, while r!V3 also has the urge to expand himself: to actually  *be everywhere.* Like his end goal is not just to ensure immortality + duplication + non-value-drift, but he would not in fact be satisfied with r!V's endgame because other versions of himself challenging each other for funsies implies other versions of himself with too many potential differences for him to feel safe.  He wants to be a single-minded super-organism.

    This seems best spelled out from chapter 38:

    >There pulsed within me the Yeerkish drive to expand—to spread and conquer, to pull all that I could into my own experience, to touch reality at every point. But there was also within me a deep and unrelenting horror of unbecoming—of waking up one day and not even noticing that I had ceased to be myself. Perhaps it came from Alloran—or perhaps it was the work of the gods, a subtle intervention in the chaotic moment when I was neither still Cirran, nor yet Esplin—but it had been with me since the beginning, had fueled my efforts from the very first, from that frantic moment of panic when I realized that I had but a single cycle to find an alternative source of kandrona before being forced to choose between dissolution and death.

    >All right, you might think, as I had in that desperate beginning. Find a way to duplicate yourself, then, and form a coalescion out of that.

    >And indeed, this was the first of the favors I had begged from Quatazhinnikon, in exchange for my vigil over his fragile kingdom. Yet as we drew closer to success, I began to realize—

    >If you take an insect and double its size, it will not survive—it will fall from the sky—be unable to breathe—chemical reactions inside of it will cease as molecules drop from cellular receptors that no longer fit.

    >In the same way, if you take a set of traits and double them, you will no longer have the same person, for all that the relative relationships between those traits remain constant. Different traits have different payoff matrices—they result in different rewards at different strengths. If a person possesses trait A at eighty percent of its effective maximum, and trait B at forty percent, then upon doubling that person will find trait B more influential to their overall personality than before, as A hits its ceiling and B closes the gap. This is a simplistic example, more false than true, but it is generally instructive—one who has become both twice as angry and twice as patient is not in any sense the same, and the nature of Yeerks is such that twice the flesh is twice the personality.

    >And if you desire to spread across a universe—to persist across trillions of bodies, last for trillions of revolutions—to double and double and double again, without end—then even the tiniest such differences will eventually be magnified to tremendous scales, shifting one’s priorities—and therefore one’s self—in unpredictable ways. It had been the work of a moment to separate Esplin from Cirran, and in that moment, Cirran had doomed itself—I share almost none of its values, and the universe I would bring about is not one that it would have chosen. I dared not allow the same fate to befall me.

    >For what is an individual, if not the effect it would have upon reality? Who could I possibly identify with, except one who would apply the same labels of good and bad as I, and in the same proportions, and with the same actions resulting in response? If I brought about a being greater than myself in every way, and that being chose what I would not have chosen—not in specific, not as a result of greater perception, but in principle—then I would have failed, and killed myself in the process.

    What's not clear to me, and I guess my first question that needs Word of God: does this urge actually include the need to conquer all other sapience? Does he want to be THE only sapience? Or if he were assured of *true immortality*, would he then be okay to share the world with lesser beings, or equals-that-could-not-harm-him?
    ```

    - u/TK17Studios:
      ```
      So, as I conceive of him, he definitely wants immortality *and* omnipotence in the sense of being able to reshape the universe as he sees fit.

      But he's demonstrated a willingness to share the world with lesser beings already, in his compact with the Arn and his attempts to forge a pact with the Chee.  He doesn't love the idea, but it's thinkable, and even actable-onnable, if the tradeoffs are right.

      He wants the resources of the universe to flow according to what seems, to him, to be the constrained obvious correct answer.  He's not actually making all that many *choices*—he has an algorithm of sorts that is merciless; once you see what *should* be done, that's what you *must* do.

      Most of his hatred/despising of other individuals and groups comes from what he sees as their *ineffectuality*—that they're not even *being* what they're nominally trying to be.

      I imagine he could probably tolerate a universe full of *effective* Others, provided that their existence didn't impinge upon his own lifespan or liberty.  Or at least, that's a thing he would probably admit even now, prior to any healing.

        Ah, okay, so I figured those alliances were to further his ends, but would not actually be safe if he wins. I have no concept of whether r!V3 is a "being of honor" in that sense, so this helps a bit.

        The next question is what he values beyond his winning state. To quote the latest Worth the Candle chapter, edited to avoid spoilers:

        >"So tell me, if you value good for its own sake, what does good look like to you?”

        >“What do you mean?” The tone of their voice made it sound as though they suspected that this was a trick. It *was* a trick, but not in the usual sense, since the follow-up questions would (ideally) help with the process of reframing how they looked at the world.

        >“Imagine that you died tomorrow, and in your final moments, the Dungeon Master came to you and said that you could make any changes you wanted to the world. You would have no limits whatsoever and no worries about time, just carte blanche to alter the world. What would you do? You can take your time to think.”

        >“And what would you do?”

        >“I don’t want to poison the well with my answer. If you’d like, I can share my thoughts once you’re done. Again, it’s fine to think about it first. I would prefer that you think out loud though, because I’m more interested in your thoughts than your answer.”

        >“I think you want me to say all the obvious. No pain, no terror, nothing forced on anyone, a happy world where every day is better than the last and nothing negative happens to anyone at all.”

        >“But that’s not what you actually think?”

        >“For a very long time, the best moments of my life were when I was enacting justice."

        >“You mean that you slaughtered anyone you wanted."

        >"You haven’t mentioned the torture, but you don’t need to pussyfoot around it, because when I say justice, I mean that too. In a world without pain or terror, there would be no badness, but with no badness, there would be nothing to bring justice against. It would simply be gone, replaced by nothing.”

        >“You yearn to right perceived wrongs. In this perfect world, do you think there would be nothing to replace that yearning? Nothing to replace the warm feeling of satisfaction when you’ve dealt out perceived justice?”

        >“You said that I would be dead, not able to live in the world I had created. So I suppose the question is whether I value justice, in the abstract, for its own sake, or whether it’s simply because justice makes me feel good. I’m not sure that I know. I would be depriving others, but not myself."

        What is r!V3's answer to the hypothetical? Assuming he has one and it's not "if I'm dead it doesn't matter" or some cheat to come back to life.
        ```

          My model was that the *entire point* of those deals was that Visser Three couldn't be planning to break them after he wins, that the value of using a Leeran is that both parties can see that the other side has made a credible pre-commitment. And the interesting mechanic is that there's no external agent forcing each side to keep the deal, but the deal is only possible if each will keep their side without anyone forcing them to. Analogous to the final arc of HPMOR, or Parfit's Hitchhiker. 

          So, in a sense, it's not about being a "being of honour" inherently, it's about being able to adopt a sense of honour when it's genuinely in your interests.

          And this also struck me as one of the first "wow, r!Visser Three is a genuinely terrifying villain" moments, because the ability to make credible pre-commitments isn't one that a cliched villian should be able to have
          ```

          - u/TK17Studios:
            ```
            FWIW, this matches my model and my intent in writing that part of the story—I wanted to show that V3 is capable of *cooperating with himself across time,* including being able to make binding commitments for benefits that can only be achieved if the commitment is Actually Sincere.

            > it's not about being a "being of honour" inherently, it's about being able to adopt a sense of honour when it's genuinely in your interests.

              Does your model of V3 consider *I always follow my pre-commitments no matter what* as a core enough value that violating it would count as a "death"? Would he actually be vulnerable to the trick someone suggested a couple chapters ago, where the kids hold him hostage by threatening to ram the Hork-Bajir planet with the bug fighter?
              ```

              - u/TK17Studios:
                ```
                More like "I always follow whatever pre-commitments are only made possible by being followed no matter what."

                There are some pre-commitments which he can make à la HJPEV thinking "any oath is an Unbreakable Oath if made by the right person."  But there are others where he will happily lie.  A lot depends on the capacity of the other person to distinguish; V3 actually has a *vested interest* in other people knowing that some of his commitments are kept and others not, and at least some degree of ability to discern the difference.

                Leerans help a lot.

          (Note: this question is at the center of the resolution to Wheel of Time in a way that was satisfying even despite Sanderson's hackneyed prose.)

          It's possible that Visser Three has literally never sat down to think it through, and that this is one of the directions an attempt to heal him might go. Like, one of the threads Aubrey Thyme might pull on.

              imo it is the single greatest fantasy epic in the English language, by a gap of about the same magnitude as the competence gap between Ender and Dink.  And this even with the slump after Jordan's death.  I have read every book at least three times (the earlier ones six or seven times).

                The people who complain about it being "too long" or "too slow" are confusing "I guess I just don't actually like this world and this style" with "this is badly written," which it is not.  You know that feeling where you never want the book to end?

                The people who complain about sexism are cherry-picking; there's a big difference between "I can construct a claim that this work is sexist by adversarially sampling 4,400,000 words" and "the contents of that claim are representative of the work as a whole, or its message, or the dozens of named female characters."

                (there's also some sex-negative bent to those comments as well)

                idk what other criticisms there are; those are the only two I've heard.

                  What it does particularly well is *comprehensively* include *every* fantasy trope or archetype in existence, yet bend each of them into a new and interesting form.  There's a Tom Bombadil, there are Dementors, there are witches and wizards, there are knights in shining armor, there's a cut from a curséd knife.  But each is uniquely done, and I know of no other fantasy world where they're *all* there.

                  There are plot elements laid in that pay off *eight books later.*

                    And it sets up its large, mind-shattering impactful moments insanely well—things happen which were *so shocking* to me that it was like I was an actual member of the world.  Like, "that *breaks physics,* tho" happened to me in the same way that it happened to the characters, my confusion and terror mirroring theirs.

                  Most of the criticisms on this seem more to do with inconsistent pacing/quality between books (like I've heard people say there are a couple books you can skip entirely and just read a three sentence synopsis on and not miss anything of value). To be fair it's hard to keep a consistent quality between books in any case, let alone in a series so long... I think Dresden Files is my go-to example of the best case of a series that actually gets better book by book for over a dozen books running, with arguably a dip in the latest one (though this might just be my anti-theism influencing things).

                    Yeah, I think those people are crazy.  Like, I can sort of force myself to imagine what they mean, but it's like forcing myself to imagine that There Are Five Lights or something.

                    I do not think there are quality differentials or pacing differentials exceeding ... 15 percent? ... between any of the Jordan-written books.  Sometimes the world slows down, and it's sometimes *right* to show that rather than cutting to Six Months Later; Harry Potter VII wouldn't be as good of a book without the Forest of Dean because the Forest of Dean is a crucible for his character.  I know which books in Wheel of Time have fewer events in them, and I reread those just as often.

                    Or, to put it another way, it's like those people are saying "Yeah, actually, you can skip the whole first fifteen or twenty minutes of 2001: A Space Odyssey, it's just some monkeys being influenced by an alien artifact."

                    Like ?????? You're talking about skipping ... *why?* Are you ... are you not actually along for this ride??

                    Like if you only want to take part in a Circling circle while it's being *about* something, or like if you only want to play soccer in the playoff games, but you don't want to go to practices or play skirmishes or lesser games. Or like saying "you can skip all the parts of Fight Club that are about, like, this weird relationship, and get back to the fighting, which is the whole point."

                    The people who say those things *don't like Wheel of Time.* It's not that Wheel of Time has failed them; it's that they were expecting something that it isn't (something it consistently was, and stayed, the whole time).

                    In rationalspeak, they can't pass Wheel of Time's ITT.  They can't express what it's trying to be sufficiently well that their criticism is then actually valid critique; they're criticizing it according to standards it's not trying to meet.  Like complaining that Moby Dick doesn't have enough action, or Star Wars enough awareness of intersectionality and the gritty realities of institutional injustice.

                    Disliking it is fine, btw. People can change their minds about a movie half an hour in. It's just not a sign that Wheel of Time has betrayed them or whatever.

                    If I bite into lasagna and I taste ricotta cheese, I don't blame the lasagna, even if the ricotta cheese wasn't visible from the outside. *It's a lasagna.*

                      Some of these examples definitely hit harder than others, for me: the Fight Club one feels like an obvious missing-the-point on the viewer's part, whereas I'm one of those unsophisticated philistines who thinks 2001 was a good [however many minutes the HAL9000 plot is] short film bracketed by two boring/trippy art pieces that only technically can be called a "movie."

                            It's popular, but the *explicit narrative* around it is "eh, problematic, mixed bag, antiquated," etc.  Like, it's something that vastly more people will quietly enjoy than openly criticize, but the open criticism is itself sort of ... unassailable?  Like, criticizing the criticism can get you labeled a sexist or an apologist, for instance, or out you as someone unable to judge literary quality.

                            The inverse of how criticizing 2001 for having two trippy unnecessary art pieces on either end is more likely to land as "Daystar has no taste" or "Daystar just doesn't get it" than it is to land as "huh, actually, now that you mention it ..."

      I accept DaystarEld's analysis of the visser's issues as accurate and propose that the way to fix the problem is through the Chee. He already claims to be amenable to being nice to dogs. If they can trust each other enough to come to an agreement, I am sure something can be worked out where the visser gets his mind uploaded to a robot for the low low cost of being nice to dogs. The Chee are seemingly pretty close to being a hive mind - it should be easy for the visser to make a few or more than a few extra robots which his core robot controls and which don't have the value drift problem of his organic spare bodies, since he can hardwire his opinions into himself in robot form. Chee bodies are tough and long lasting which should assuage his concerns about death if he takes sensible precautions. I have been assuming this as a non-zero risk in the actual story, judging risk from the perspective of the animorphs.

    We have 7 Visser clones running around now. Funny coincidence - we have a bunch of Marclones too. Bet the Visser would find that interesting...but that's tangential. Who could the Visser possibly identify with? Himself. Excellent, there's 6 others who now meet this criteria. Each clone will struggle to find an alternative to 'dissolution or death'. I have no doubt that every clone would help the other(s) survive, but what happens if there were a situation where there are two clones but only one can survive? That could be an interesting compare and contrast to the Marclones chapters.

    The Visser failed to plan for Telor's self-sacrifice in this recent chapter. Is it because the idea of self-sacrifice is unthinkable to him?

      My thinking is that he just thought that Telor in particular didn't have it in them.  Moderately impactful spoilers for part 2: >!Telor didn't actually sacrifice themselves; Ryen-with-an-e managed to make it out of the Brazil pool and eventually up into orbit, and successfully acquired the full coalescion.  He came back down to Earth and morphed it, sacrificing himself in the process; Telor was willing to die in its original body because and only because it knew it would be reborn in backup.!<

        ```

  - u/philh:
    ```
    (Haven't read the other replies yet. Also, I'm not sure I'm answering the question as intended, but no harm in trying.)

    So I think my main reaction is that I'm not sure I'd expect this to be possible. I mostly just feel like the Visser has fundamental values that are incompatible with mine, and that means he needs to be "fixed" from my perspective but from his perspective he's just fine.

    With a human there's the concept of "be the best you you can be" which isn't necessarily your *current* you, with the implication that you can change to better encapsulate your own values, and to some extent your values will change while doing this but your current values endorse that in some sense. (And also sometimes people change in ways that their current selves approve of but their past selves wouldn't.)

    And something like that could apply to the Visser. But I'm not sure I'd be very good at figuring out what "a better you" means for a human, and the Visser isn't human. (His Yeerk flesh was brought together before human contact IIRC, so he hasn't even absorbed any human that way.) So even if it does apply, I think I'm out of my depth.

    Also, I don't know if the result of this would be less likely to kill everyone, or if "try to make the Visser less likely to try to kill everyone" is even at all the point of the exercise.

    Still, if I were to try...

    One thing I might try would be "don't you think the universe would be more interesting if there were other things left alive in it?" With the hope that he then comes to value other living things for their own sake. But I basically expect that to fail to convince him. It would be a pretty astonishing coincidence if the best way he can keep himself entertained, is by not destroying everything I love.

    More promising, though I'm still not hopeful: he kind of seems to value self-preservation to a literally impossible extent. Like it's not clear that past him would endorse current him as a continuation of himself; or that current him would endorse clone-hims-in-the-near-fduture; or even that current him would endorse current-him-in-the-near-future. (How old is he? A few human years? No way he's done growing, whether he likes it or not.)

    So if I can convince him of that... there's nothing that says a being's fundamental values can't be fundamentally unsatisfiable. But it's the sort of thing that might cause them to shift to fundamentally valuing something different, which might be more stable and *hopefully* less likely to try to kill everyone. (Or, in humans, it might turn them into nihilists. But sometimes nihilists become hilists, as well.)

    Force the pool to mostly cohere by one part expedient use of incentives and, over time, one part learned adaptations. Yet also, force that the pool's shards specialize. Prevent them from being redundant - chemically? Memetically?

    He wouldn't be healed from the perspective of *other characters*, he could end up more powerful and monstrous than ever, but it'd certainly be character development by his own terms! Value drift is the last thing he wants, but if it's value drift accompanied by a power boost then he could be made amenable to it.

    And then once that happens, collapse him back down to a single individual, some particular weighted average of his previous parts, so that he has to resort to working with others to satisfy the drives and methods he'd been accustomed too during his time as a collective - not just seeing them as an extension of himself and his purposes, but seeing himself as a (misaligned, still selfish!) extension of them and theirs.

    Basically, he needs to struggle in order to grow, which means he needs to have his goal of self-consistency rudely violated, but in a way where he can still be around afterwards as *almost* the same person.

  Great chapter, though not enough Jake! (Guess more of him is coming in part 2).

  But the Visser parts were great - I've been craving another "Esplin" chapter, though it's interesting that this iteration of him is just referred to as "Visser" in break with previous precedent, suggesting that the melding of Esplin and Alloran is now complete. Also, it seems the dominance of single POV chapters might be at its end.

  The Visser being at war with himself was great; that's peak rationalist style right there, having a character thinking about thinking about thinking...

  So one major thing strikes me as unrealistic or flawed about the Visser which also I noticed previously in the chapter when he was thinking through his plan for immortality. It seems the Visser believes that the ideal goal for himself and his clones is perfect self-alignment: no part of himself should be at war with any other part, but rather all parts at a singularity of purpose. In this chapter he is disturbed when he thinks his Alloran-side might be trying to subvert him. However, I think that the state of being at war with yourself is just, in a sense, the default state of all intelligent beings. Intelligences are composed of subsystems with their own simple "goals," and the goals of the higher level system emerge from the competition of the lower level goals. Inner conflict seems to be integrated into the algorithm for intelligence by default. The Visser in this chapter is too worried about whether part of himself is pulling in a different direction than the other parts, when he should just be worried about what he thinks is the right thing to do, at the object level. After all, he just *is* the composition of Esplin and Alloran; his "true goals" have already shifted.

  About his expectation of perfect alignment from his clones, this seems like an impossible fantasy. The Visser executed clones for just the *slightest* drift, from some random noise in the cloning process and a few minutes of different memories. If his idea of alignment is really so fragile to circumstance, then he will never achieve his dream, for it is nearly physically impossible to prevent small drift in that way. He should focus on goals that are robust to random changes and conducive to cooperation by similar agents. If Visser 3 is unable to cooperate with beings so close to himself, then his dream is folly and he is doomed to be a tragic figure. Sure, he's striving for a unified consciousness spread across multiple beings rather than independent clones, but A) that's also going to run into drift problems for the same reasons, and B) he's already failed, because now there are seven independent clones of him running around, if there weren't any already.

  The little we get of Jake is excellent. It's about time he broke down crying, after all he's been through. Looks like he's going to have another heart-to-heart with Marco, which makes me very happy.

  As a side note, the friendship of Jake and Marco reminds me a lot of some of my own friendships, and has partially inspired me to have some really great, deep conversations with my friends, as recently as a few days ago, so yeah.

    Nah, I'm sure that the clones in the outside galaxy whom he's planning to send on suicide missions to keep the Yeerk fleet busy are perfectly happy to die for the sake of the greater him and won't try to sell him out to save their skin. He trusts himself so much that his resurrection procedure involves being strapped to a table with a pointlessly high number of guns pointed at him, ready to blow his brains out if he forgets his recovery password.

Inner conflict seems to be integrated into the algorithm for intelligence by default

    Broadly I agree with this.

    In the original Animorphs canon, it was pointed out as something unique to humans (or Earth). [Here's the passage, for reference](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/7jm32a/text_animorphs_an_alien_discovers_our/).

    Rather than this being unique to humans though, in this canon I see that perhaps the yeerks are unique in lacking this (this is just a theory I'm working off at the moment). I imagine an initial yeerk pool as an unintelligent organism; a stagnant pool of biological material. Unthinking, unfeeling. Eventually it starts splitting off shards that encounter foreign brains. Suddenly they encounter a second voice, one that the yeerk does have control over, yes, but it provides that competition that yeerk thought process lacked. That shard learns from the competition (as well as sensory inputs, memory, etc) and shares that with the coalescion. 

    But there would still be that element of the competing voice belonging to the controlled and not the yeerk itself. So while the yeerks as a whole have this whole competing voice intelligence forming -- just like every other intelligent species -- it's not coming from within. Thus when Visser Three starts encountering this inner conflict in his own mind, it seems like a foreign invasion of his thoughts. It's just not a thing the yeerks had ever had to deal with.

    If that's accurate though, then perhaps Alloran isn't quite as responsible for the inner conflict as it initially seems. Perhaps just sowing some seeds of doubt by his former presence and current absence.

    On that note, I do wonder about the Visser's current biology. Obviously he's a clone, but is he a clone of Alloran being controlled by a clone of Esplin? Or is the result of the Visser's experiments a new (Andalite?) brain with Esplin's memories and values? Does it have something like the morph tech's yeerk control tissue present?
    ```

    - u/TK17Studios:
      ```
      It's a new body (this wasn't clarified in the chapter); V3 isn't morphing anymore because he doesn't want to surrender his mind to potential tampering, so switching to a hybrid with [all of the properties of Esplin + Alloran] was basically costless.
      ```

      - u/death_au:

        So it's the second option then? More or less Alloran's body with a hybrid brain with (Esplin's interpretation of) a clone of his consciousness?

  Great chapter, always good to see this story update. I never managed to read the entire Animorphs story so it always feels like things are going over my head but I usually manage to keep up with most of what's happening. 

  The Garrett interlude from a few chapters ago really helped clear things up, I had been (and still am) considering doing a reread because while things don't feel close to ending it does feel like the beginning of the last arc is being set up or we're already in it.

  Oh man, Alloran hit HARD.

  From what I understood of Esplin's goals, Alloran sabotaged them real good. The way I see it, Esplin is dead (so is Alloran, really) and his goals are kaput. That doesn't make this new "Visser" character and his clones any less dangerous though.

   I am a little confused about his plans now, though, and I guess most of it was in place before he died. So I guess I'm also questioning Esplin's original goal. Is it his goal to rule the universe? (Seems absurd). Wipe out any threat to his continued existence (basically everyone in the universe)? Make everyone in the universe Visser-controlled? Achieve godhood (now that he is fully aware of their existence)?
  ```

  - u/TK17Studios:
    ```
    His goal has always been something like "stop the increase of entropy," as a logical extension of "stay alive as long as possible."  His first step toward that was something like explicit control over all intelligent activity, but yeah, now that he knows there's a layer above that he's not going to settle for "mere" control.

          ```
          I understand that perspective, but I'm still struggling with how flawed it is. (And I get that it's probably the whole point from an author perspective).

          He wants to continue to live, as he is right now. If his values change he considers that a failure because he is no longer him. But what constitutes a value change? Every moment he is alive, he's taking in new information, processing it and adjusting his trajectory based on that information. Does that not mean he has grown as an individual? That he is "greater" than he was yesterday, even if it is by the most miniscule of amounts?

          I guess that from his perspective, growth and even value  drift may be acceptable, as long as it's still him in control of it. If his multiple clones start drifting in different directions that's a problem because then they are different individuals and therefore in competition.

          This new thought process he has discovered with an inner conflict disturbs him because he feels Alloran may be responsible for it (which he likely is). He rejects the notion of what he sees as a foreign invasion into his thoughts, even as he is unable to distinguish any of those thoughts as foreign.

          I kinda lost what my point was going to be, just processing the information for myself "out loud" I guess.
          ```

          - u/TK17Studios:
            ```
            /nod

            Both V3 (and, to be honest, me) resolve this with something like a "sculptor/sculpture" distinction, as referenced in text by both Esplin and Rachel.

            > growth and even value drift may be acceptable, as long as it's still him in control of it

            Yeah.  The idea being that there's some *Platonic ideal* of who-you-are or what-you're-trying-to-accomplish.  It may be only partially clear to you, and your methods of moving toward it may be only partially effective, but you have a "statue" in mind, a kind of guiding star, and so as you carve away the marble, the ever-changing present-day "you" evolves according to a known principle or principles.

            And as you get clearer "sight" on this vision-of-you-and-your-goals (that's treated as sort of having always existed, outside of yourself), maybe you make some updates to the plan, "moving a foot" metaphorically, or trying out some entirely new process for sculpting.  But these changes are sort of backwards-compatible in that past-you would have endorsed and embraced them at any point (and if past-you *wouldn't* have, then present-you doesn't, either, until more work can be done).

            So V3 looks at a range of possible behaviors, say, and can evaluate some of them as *clearly* alien/not-him (he doesn't give a shit about swathes of flowers on a hillside, the way Quatazhinnikon does; nor would he create a continent's-worth of monsters just to watch them fight).  Other behaviors are clearly familiar/him-shaped (like pursuing biological immortality).  He's indifferent to, or ambivalent about, behaviors that don't clearly break down along these lines, but as he grows and gets more experiences under his belt, he'll be more and more opinionated about which ones were wasteful or purposeless, and which ones "qualify" as part of what he's trying to sustain and keep going with his life extension efforts.

            (I want to be able to keep building LEGO spaceships basically forever, or some updated, more sophisticated future equivalent, but I'm not super interested in preserving my own ability to derive extremely mild hedonistic enjoyment from extremely unhealthy foods.  One of these I would "cut out" of my own code, given the chance; the Visser just thinks he has the right (nay, the *moral obligation*) to cut things out of *other* people's codes, too.)

            Thus, for instance, the model of Ender Wiggin that twelve-year-old me carried around on his shoulder and asked for advice from time to time knew nothing of the Sequences or of Circling or whatever, but *the instant I became aware of those things,* it was clear that the Platonic Ender definitely had those in his toolkit/endorsed them.  Picking them up was a change to the sculpture-of-me, but it was also largely mundane within the scope of the larger plan.  I was just "becoming more myself," according to a preset and unchanging vision of what-the-ideal-Duncan-looks like.

            (Even though past Duncan *didn't know* that he had deficits in the specific arenas of rationality or interpersonal relating, and wouldn't have been able to predict them in anything but general terms.)

              I think a big part of the reason this whole story is so interesting to me is this whole exploration of what "self" means. And the *reason* that interests me is because it's somehow an idea I've never explored in myself.

              I've *always* been of the default assumption that I should forever continue to learn more and grow, but it's only been in the last couple of years that I've realised that "acquiring knowledge" isn't actually doing anything for me and I've attempted to shift into self-improvement.

              But I'm also coming to the realisation that I don't know what my "self" even is at this point. I don't know what I want to be. I don't quite have that guiding star. In that Rachel chapter, seeing the drift between her current self and her "previous" self, she had the revelation about the sculpture/sculptor thing, and also realised that her previous self had no concept of the sculptor at all. She wasn't really shaping herself, she was just... *being*. Growth was happening, but there was no intention or direction behind it.

              That's kinda where I am now. I'm starting to become aware that I *can* shape myself, but I'm yet to decide what I should be shaping myself *into*, and that's causing me a bit of anxiety. That anxiety has been present for years, but thanks to this story exploring those concepts I at least now have a concept of what that anxiety is actually *about*.

              I came for the Animorphs nostalgia, stayed for the writing, and now find myself questioning my sense of self. No idea if any of that was intentional on your part, but your sharing inspired me to share. (I also feel obligated to condense some of this writing into a review, now)

                As far as deciding what you "should" be shaping yourself into, if I might offer a piece of advice, it would be something like: practice building up the *yes, that's it* skill within yourself.  Like, the skill of noticing when a phrase perfectly matches an emotion, or when a proposed meal perfectly matches the hunger you're feeling.

                I think you're most likely to find fulfillment (rather than disappointment or failure or discontent) along a path where you *recognize* what you "should be trying to shape yourself into" rather than generating it from whole cloth.

                Like, when I first encountered the character Ender, the overwhelming feeling was "ahhhhhhh, *that's* it."  It felt familiar, not new.

                I bet the "optimal path" for you will feel familiar, at least a little bit.  It'll be like putting on an old shoe that still fits perfectly.  And the skill of *recognizing* your own psyche's response of "yes that's it" is one that a lot of people are rusty with, and can improve by trying.

                  You SHOULD feel proud. This is something I likely would have worked out eventually, but this story made me think about it in a different way and the thoughts are crystallizing sooner.

                  Thanks for the advice, too. A lot of self-help advice preaches practicing gratitude, and I keep hearing about studies that say it will increase happiness, but I never really understood it, myself. The "yes, that's it" feeling makes a lot more sense to me and I suspect is probably part of what gratitude practice is all about. Again, crystallizing advice I've heard elsewhere, bringing me that much closer and internalizing it and practicing it. I get the ideas behind gratitude practice, but your "yes, that's it" advice actually feels like "yes, that's it".

  Let's take a moment to appreciate that Jake is seeing into the mind of these Andalites, via the eib through Alloran, via the Leeran hypersight through Quatazhinnikon, via morph-control.

  > I was as sure as I’d ever been that somewhere deep inside of Visser Three, the part of him that was Alloran was biding his time.  Waiting his chance.  Doing everything he could to throw a wrench in the works, to nudge things into place for an eventual fall from grace.  I was as sure as I’d ever been that Alloran, of all people, would never, ever give up the fight.

  I'm not entirely sure how Jake got here from "Alloran is able to see past 1984-type bullshit", other than "well, I guess that means he's a super-competent rationalist badass and of course a super-competent rationalist badass would be like this." Maybe that was the intent, but otherwise I didn't quite follow the leap.

  Switching to Visser's POV... are we in his head via Jake and Quatazhinnikon? That was my first thought, but as the memory progresses, it seems like it's too new to be in Quatazhinnikon's memory, unless I've got the timeline confused.

  welp that escalated quickly, but then, so has this whole fic so

  CRY. CRY YOUR HEART OUT JAKE YOU NEED IT.

  > One further promise he made himself, in unison across all of his various bodies—that, should the estimated odds of critical failure for plans not involving the Earth drop below one in seven, he would immediately trigger the destruction of the planet and establish a permanent blockade over the Z-space bridge.

  Visser Three determining his criterion for sacrificing the earth reminds me of the conversation chapter 37 Marco', where they discuss the criterion for when to sacrifice the earth, and that quote,

  > “If we are being jerked around,” he said.  “By the Ellimist, or Crayak, or whoever—if you’re trying to trick somebody into blowing up the world, it’s a lot easier to get them to flip the switch if they’re already willing.  If they’ve already made up their mind what would get them to do it.”

  Particularly noteworthy given Visser's own concerns about being "jerked around".

  Furthermore, I don't know how literal Visser is being with his one-in-seven figure - if he's really doing numerical calculations on the odds of "critical failure for plans not involving the Earth" - but I can't help but notice that one-in-seven is kind of an arbitrary number which clearly results ultimately from Andalite convention.

  Great chapter, thanks for writing as always.

    > I'm not entirely sure how Jake got here from "Alloran is able to see past 1984-type bullshit"

    It's not spelled out in text, but the idea is that Jake is getting a "feel" for Alloran's gestalt, by looking over all of the memories, and combining that with his sense of "some of what makes Esplin inexorable as an opponent is derived from Alloran as the substrate."  I think if anyone other than Jake were making the claim, it would be unfounded/a stretch, but Jake's the guy with the pretty good black box.

    The Visser sections were present-day Visser, yeah, not Q-memories.

    > I can't help but notice that one-in-seven is kind of an arbitrary number which clearly results ultimately from Andalite convention

    I'm glad someone else noticed this! I wasn't going to share this theory because I thought it was too weird or abstract or whatever, but here goes.

    We know the gods have done a *lot* of active work shaping the evolution of relevant species, right? Temrash points out how incredibly unlikely it is that you'd get a bunch of intelligent life from different planets so similar to each other, and all compatible with Yeerk tissue, and Andalite biology and culture so perfectly shaped to miss noticing it. I would guess the number of fingers and number of original pools would be way simpler to shape via coincidence than fine-tuning all that neuro anatomy, and like /u/tjhance said, there is no way that 1/7 is the exactly optimal probability the Visser should be using here. It's either too cautious or too confident.

    Also:

    * Knowing the exact chance of failure where you should cut your losses to keep from wasting resources is a critical part of the game
    * The Ellimist (probably) once made a tree grow for thousands of years, just so a Pemalite (maybe?) would trip at the exact moment the Howlers howled, tainting their collective memory with overconfidence
    * Alloran's only real weapon against Esplin is messing with his cautiousness/arrogance (speculating that Alloran and Esplin are pieces that belong to different gods)

    I think it's totally plausible that one or both gods pushed the Andalites and Yeerks to anchor on the numbers 7 and 13, specifically because they're close to, but slightly higher or lower than the "correct" probability he should be assigning at one or more critical points, just to push him a little further into cautiousness or arrogance. I say V3 because he's the only character I can think of (besides maybe the Chee) who makes enough Bayseian calculations for it to matter.

    Of course maybe I'm just overthinking a nice worldbuilding touch. If that's the case, a very tiny feedback:

    >an eventual victory ten thousand revolutions in the future was still immeasurably better than permanent defeat

    Should be seven thousand or thirteen thousand, unless the intent is to show the human influence getting to him.

      ```
      You're not overthinking, and I love you.  Strongly considering that edit to hammer the point home.
      ```

- u/FenrirW0lf:
  ```
  Also this is a bit of a tangent but I can't help but wonder how Leerans work. As in, what was life like for these hyper psychics who live in a perpetual fantasy drug trip before the Yeerks came along and crashed their party? Do they have individual natures and personalities? Do they have a society? What would their society even look like?
  ```

  - u/philh:
    ```
    First thought: there might be some amount of similarity between them and the telepathic species in *A Fire Upon The Deep*? (They aren't telepathic with other species, just themselves, since IIRC some of their brain activity is encoded in EM waves between two antenna-things.) So that might be a source of more thoughts on the subject.

    Second thought: huh, in some ways those are actually more like the Yeerks. If they get too close to each other they basically stop being individuals, and indeed most "people" are actually 3-4 of them in a close pack. And if one leaves or dies, the remainder will want to be careful about who replaces them, to avoid changing too much.

    (It's been a while since I read the book.)

    Another intuition pump that might be relevant here is Greg Egan's short *Unstable Orbits in the Space of Lies*.

  So yeah, that was intense. Can you elaborate on how the neutron explosives work? He mentions that it leaves the human infrastructure intact so I'm just imagining humans exploding on the street which isn't great. That's a definite blow to humanity and I was really hoping to get Jakes reaction to it this chapter, although the scene with him and Elena was amazing.

  You may have also touched on this before, and I apologize if you have. In earlier Visser 3/Esplin chapters it seems like you went back and fourth between 1st and 3rd person. After the most recent Esplin chapter was done in 1st person I assumed you were just going to keep it that way, but is there a reason you're back to 3rd person? Does it have to do with how Esplin and Alloran are now one?

  Also I love how you consistently take aspects of the canon story and retell them in an even more fucked up fashion. Poor Mertil...

    u/AstralCodex is correct about the neutron explosives; we'll see Jake's reaction in part 2.

    Honestly, V3 started out as third person because that's how it was written by ketura, who sent me the omake and then allowed me to repossess it.  I liked it as 3rd person because that made it feel distinct from the other viewpoint characters.

    Then I screwed up and forgot when I wrote the next Esplin chapter.

    I stuck with first person for a while, and then this one felt somehow more appropriate "at a distance" ... it let me do more poetic prose, for instance.

    Overall, this entire story is, for me, a way to experiment and grow as a writer, trying new things in a sort of low-stakes way, so whenever there's been an opportunity to stretch in a new direction (reddit interludes, weird perspective, trying to write a stroke from the inside), I've just defaulted to "give it a shot."  This chapter, with the weird back and forth between Jake and V3, plus switching back to third person V3, was another instance of that.

    Re: Neutron Explosives. I read it as a more advanced version of a [Neutron Bomb](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_bomb), which is a nuclear weapon “designed to maximize lethal neutron radiation in the immediate vicinity of the blast while minimizing the physical power of the blast itself.” The Visser wants to kill key humans, but preserve the infrastructure, and that’s in line with the design objectives of neutron bombs irl.

  I am intrigued that Seerow's backdoor has shifted from being 'read the morph's mind' in an early Esplin chapter to 'use the god computer' now. 
  NB I didn't bother to reread the earlier chapter but remembered the previous use of the phrase so maybe Esplin meant the same thing both times and I misinterpreted it the first time. 

  The anecdote about Mertil was <i>extremely</i> interesting. If we could have a whole 'the life and times of Alloran-Semitur-Corass', I would be delighted. It also coincidentally marks a return to what I had taken to be important, the question of Alloran Vs Esplin.

  I don't watch Rick and Morty and welcome a fun explanation of what Scenario 4 is in that context.
  ```

  - u/TK17Studios:
    ```
    Previously Esplin thought of "Alloran's little backdoor" to refer to being able to access a morph's mind; "Seerow's backdoor" is how the Visser is now thinking of the way-into-the-hypercomputer which Seerow initially found and used to build the morphing tech.

    I might benefit from switching up the phrasing since it's Esplin/Visser's thought both times, and the same word "backdoor."

    In a Rick and Morty episode featuring recorded memories, >!two characters accidentally erase their entire episodic memories and a third character, witnessing their confusion, says "is this a Scenario Three?"  After the two characters reveal that they have no idea what that even means, the third character goes "Oh—it's a Scenario *Four*."!<

  > neuroatypicals

  Broke my immersion. The word is too conceptually reified. Jake's a basketball jock with good intuition, so even the Harry Potter references are kind of pushing it, and this goes much further than them. It's entirely reasonable that he'd have a similar sentiment, regarding Andalite attitudes towards unconventional ways of thinking, but he wouldn't voice that via the shibboleths of modern online social justice movements.

  I also worry that Andalites might be being Flanderized, relative to their earlier characterization in the story. It was almost universally acknowledged that Elfangor was a genius, idiosyncratic yet incredibly effective. That doesn't fit well with the idea that they dislike neurodiversity per se.

  > 
  The alien slumped, dropping his torso even closer to the ground, hiding his main eyes completely.

  Why would Helium be ashamed of the attitude that those who are weak or different should be condemned? That's not a part of his culture. Even though he is personally a unique exception, would be condemned by Andalite society for diverging from their Path, it doesn't follow that he'd adopt all the norms of a modern enlightened liberal universalist in a bundle. It's coherent to be Darwinist and also be a hivemind.

  > It wasn’t surprising.  Not really.  From the things Ax had told me, Andalite groupthink was incredibly powerful—what the crowd believed just was the apparent truth, a lot of the time, as difficult to question as the color of the sky.

  > And if Alloran was a beloved hero, a tragic martyr, a perfect specimen of Andalite nobility and genius—

  > Well, then, of course he wouldn’t have had anything to do with shit-rats.

  Pretty disdainful, for Jake. Rejecting that mindset, yes. Failing to see its pull, no.

  > There was no anger or frustration.  There was, if anything, a begrudging respect, tinging the boundaries of a larger surprise.  He would not have thought Telor capable of self-sacrifice, had made no plans for that contingency, except in the general sense of having readied himself for disasters of similar—and greater—magnitude.

  Shouldn't the Visser be more disdainful? Self-sacrifice is the antithesis of what he stands for.

  > They were not, precisely, the source of his unease.  They were watching, certainly; interfering, without question—but they had yet to impede him directly in any detectable fashion, and while he would not claim that he had tried everything, still he had spent long weeks endeavoring to divine their intentions, to provoke unambiguous response, and thus far all for nothing.  If they intended to reveal themselves, it would clearly be at a time of their choosing; what plans could be made in ignorance, what defenses set against their sight and their reach, he had already done.

  It is curious that the gods would appear to the Animorphs but not to the Visser, now that I think about it. I guess that means that the Visser is more stable, less susceptible to being influenced by minute changes in his environment.

  > He was not one person.

  > He was not one person, and never had been.  Alloran had always been the enemy of Esplin, and Esplin the enemy of Alloran, and the hostility between them had not ended, had merely gone quiet, and somehow he had not noticed, because—

  > Because he felt like one person.

  > Not in words, the thought.  More a feeling, a formless confusion, and along with it a sudden ratcheting of his awareness, a stepping-back of perspective.

  > His goal—the goal, the true goal, the only goal that made actual sense—

  > He had thought—he supposed—that Alloran had converted, seen the wisdom of the quest and dropped his petty, personal resistance.  He must have thought that, at the time, only he couldn’t actually remember—

  > And now came the true dread, the rising horror, for the creature that was the Visser turned his stalks inward, searching, searching, and finding—

  > There was no clear division within himself, no two agents arguing—just himself, a tangled mass of fear and confusion, ambition and fury.  He was Esplin, and he was Alloran, and he remembered both, remembered being both, but the two had fused, and both were in control—he was in control, no part of him any less than any other—

  I have a hard time buying this. There's a fundamental asymmetry between Yeerk and host according to everything we've seen so far. Even if Alloran is in the top .01% of individualistic Andalites, that shouldn't give him the power to merge himself with the brain parasite. Plus, why would he choose this moment to use such a trick? How would the Visser not having previously noticed it would occur? It feels like a last-minute plot device.
  ```

  - u/TK17Studios:
    ```
    Most of this is super helpful, and will result in useful tweaks before I put out part 2; thanks.

    The bit about fusion, though, is not a last-minute plot device; it's been in the story since Ventura; Esplin wondered a bit about Alloran's silence, then we saw Ax and Temrash establishing a deep bond, then we got confirmation from the gods that there's a peculiar quality to the Andalite-Yeerk bond in particular.
    ```

    - u/JJReeve:
      ```
      I've been thinking about this peculiar quality and am wondering; does this come down to the fact that Andalites have thought speech? With most species a yeerk can cut off information flow from it's host as it sees fit, just stop touching that part of the brain. But in an Andalites thought speech can always effect the yeerk. What's more, thought speech has been said to sound like one's own inner voice. Given that, the facct that a yeerk might lose track of where it's thoughts are actually coming from makes a certain amount of sense. 

      The only way for the Visser to remember himself at this point would be to leave Alloran for a bit, and do some good old fashion goal factoring. But that's not an option anymore, is it?

          FWIW the Esplin/Alloran fusion felt very natural and well-foreshadowed to me, mainly because of this line in the hypersight sequence:

          >The beginning of a new ending, a possibility to match his own, not one but *two*—

          The Visser thinks of Ax+Temrash as an existential threat, and "not one but two" after we've been told that part of the conflict between the gods is "Unity vs. Harmony"; and the way the beginning of the Visser section evokes the beginning of Chapter 34 was a cool way getting the reader to keep the game in mind while we're reading about the fusion.

  So glad to see this update again! Jake's a lot smarter than he gives himself credit for, and I like the backstory for Alloran.

  The tone in the Visser sections is interesting to me because even though it's in the third person, it's very much his voice. And this

   *But the enemy had rolled those cubes for him* 

  seems like a humanism that he's trying to invoke but slightly missing the mark with. While this

   *and there were enough* ***fucknesses*** *surrounding the situation on Earth* 

  is highlighted as a humanism in-text. Why is he doing that? Is David still in there somewhere? That seems like a much worse downgrading than fusing closer to Alloran.

    Yeah—it was never explicitly stated in text, but the assumption was that he would get an Andalite version of the virus done first before worrying about the human version.  He also probably has caches of oatmeal just because redundancy.

    Although something that's *also* not explicitly stated in text, but which I as author believe is true—he's no longer Yeerk-plus-Andalite-brain.  Quatazhinnikon managed to capture the *synthesis* of Yeerk and Andalite in a single physiology.
