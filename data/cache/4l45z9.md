  Despite multiple attempts I haven't gotten more than a couple of paragraphs into the story. I find the fact that the author keeps switching between tenses to be surprisingly irritating. Do they get better about that later on?

    >switching between tenses

    God, that's just the worst.

    And historically, I've hated it not just because it's annoying to read, but because it was too easy to do that accidentally and not notice, and you're realizing it ten paragraphs after a switch and have to edit over everything to fix it.
