  Extra note: between this chapter and last, a major proofreading/editing update was pushed out. See details [here](http://ttshieronym.tumblr.com/post/152011941722/mass-edits).

  If you're wondering what this is, here's a description from the subreddit sidebar:

  > Hieronym's "To the Stars" is an expansive SciFi fanfic set in the universe of Puella Magi Madoka Magica, roughly four centuries after the ending of the show. (Rebellion was released after it began, so the movie isn't considered canon.)

  > "To the Stars" emphasizes worldbuilding, giving diverse and richly detailed views into a humanity shaped by centuries' worth of magical interference and technological development. Of particular interest are the last two decades and their new alien threat, which finally forced magical girls out from the shadows. Against that backdrop it all begins when Shizuki Ryouko, a young girl living in Mitakihara City, makes a contract and finds herself thrown into a mad mix of interstellar politics, religion, conspiracy, and war...
