## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  Does someone have a suggestion for a zombie story where people aren't the worst possible assholes to each other? I was playing through *Days Gone* and while I get that there needed to be a bunch of human enemies for the gameplay to work, it felt really misanthropic, especially since you end up killing hundreds of the remaining survivors. Something where people effectively work together and cooperate, and humans are not, in fact, the real monsters. (World War Z is the closest that I read, but most of my zombie consumption is in the form of games or movies, which I'd also take reccomendations for.)

    > Does someone have a suggestion for a zombie story where people aren't the worst possible assholes to each other?

    I think it's sort of inherent to the genre, so you're looking for something that subverts it.  Most zombie movies aren't really about the zombies -- they're about human failure to react to a crisis and the collapse of society, with occasional bright notes within the general darker theme.

    Sadly, most movies, games, etc. that subvert that are more likely to completely eschew the social introspection for guilt-free fun times blowing away monsters than to focus on a more positive take on humanity coming together against the darkness.
    ```

    - u/DangerouslyUnstable:
      ```
      World War Z sort of achieves this subversion by having the zombie threat eventually dealt with by exactly the sort of response to crisis you describe. However, it may not be what the commenter is looking for since it doesn't follow an isolated group trying to get through the apocalypse but is instead a meta-collection of stories (which includes brief interludes talking to people who did that).

    It's a book series, but John Ringo's Black Tide Rising series is actually quite upbeat after the first novel, and one of the main themes after the first book is rationally achieving zombie extinction. Caution: John Ringo is quite conservative, and the first book is about near human extinction.

    Well, my favourite zombie games dont have much of a story, so they are probably not relevant. But I will mention them anyway.

    [7 Days to Die](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOywC9iWDRs) - shooter with scavenging, crafting and base defence against regular hordes. Story mostly non-existent.

You can call it a roguelike, but it is not quite that. [Lore document (big spoilers)](https://cataclysmdda.org/lore-background.html) exists as reference, but is not expected to be fully available ingame. Some optional quests from NPCs may use it.

    [Don't Escape 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1070550/Dont_Escape_Trilogy/) is a rather short game, but it's a point-and-click puzzle game that started as Flash (but you can get it on Steam nowadays) in which you have to lock yourself in a room so zombies don't eat you. It's the second in a series but requires no knowledge of the previous games. You can make friends with other people in the game so your tasks don't take as long.

    It's a very very silly game, but Death Road To Canada is a lot of fun, and people are generally on your side (though some are not). How well your party treats each other depends on a morale stat, which is hard to keep high when first starting out, but it's pretty easy to keep everyone in good spirits once you get more familiar with the game.

    (Disclaimer: I last played this several years ago, memory may be foggy.)

  Summary: Litrpg about a young woman from our world that gets reborn as a baby in a roman-inspired nation in another world. Numbers go up. 

  This story might be great but I just couldn't get over the irrational way it treats sexism. 

  In this story, even though in the society it takes place women have no rights and are basically owned by their male relatives/spouses(worse than what we know of Roman plebes, to my eye), sexism is selectively relevant. The MC spends 2 decades with her dad growing up, but is somehow surprised when one day he decides to unilaterally marry her to some asshole. So she runs away and joins a special forces type group which is 4/5 men, but they all inexplicably treat her respectfully and without prejudice(better than a woman can expect to be treated in the actual, contemporary US army after centuries of civil rights movements? maybe). So I think the sexist part is a one and done deal, but then random guards or mooks will dismiss her as a woman or call her names or whatever.

  This is a pattern that repeats itself: bad people are sexist/prejudicial, good people are not. Which is just not how it works. It's only very, very recently that people have the education and good examples to actually choose whether to be sexist/racist/classist and so on. If you cloned the most ardent social justice type and raised them 2000 years ago, they would be exactly a product of their environment. They would not choose by themselves that slavery and gender roles are wrong.

  Summary: Generic chosen one/demon lord isekai, with the twist that the MC is a misanthrope who is press-ganged to become the demon lord. 

  When I first started reading I was impressed because the prose and the characterization seemed top notch, but that quickly went away as every scene was 2-3x longer than it needed to be. The MC's inner monologue feels like a useless busywork chore even when it's full of relevant exposition. Everything just seems to drag on, and on, and on. It's weird. 

  I was put off by it, but I can see why someone would like it. 

  [Vigor Mortis](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/40373/vigor-mortis)

  Summary: Forbidden necromancy powers awaken unexpectedly in a weird girl with mysterious past. 

  I not only love this story, I'm continually impressed by it. The author is doing everything right so far, and not in a rote way either. I'm repeatedly surprised by the plot and characters. The setting is obviously meticulously crafted, but she doesn't feel the need to dump exposition about it like every other novice author. Almost every chapter ends on a hook, but they don't feel like cheap cliffhangers, which is extremely hard to pull off. Yes, I'm gushing a little bit. 

  Anyway, you should try it. I'm looking forward not just to where the story will go, but also the author.

  Summary: a naive pacifist gets isekai'd into a litrpg world with his sociopath daughter and has to change or die. 

  I've trash talked this story a lot(look through my profile), but when I finally gave it a chance and got past the first 100k words... I still kinda hated it. But after another couple hundred thousand words or so I started to like it a little bit. Now, after 1.5 million words I actually really like it. Mostly i'm intrigued by how different it is from every other litrpg around, and curious of where the author is going with Erick's character/corruption. 

  Interestingly, this is one of those stories that seems at first glance very irrational, but as you learn more about the setting everything makes more and more sense. The shallow/simplistic system, the power imbalance(supremacy of alpha strikes), the factions, all the low hanging fruit lying around to be picked by the MC, pretty much all problems with the plot and setting are explained more or less to my satisfaction as the story goes on. The one exception is the CIA thing from the beginning, but I've gone on about that too much for one lifetime. (fuck the CIA though) 

  *There's no way I would have gotten past the initial hurdle(read: great wall of china) if I wasn't unemployed at the time, and so I recommend this story only if you're currently also a NEET like me.

  Summary: MC is a timelooper on a revenge quest in a fucked up fantasy world full of arbitrarily powerful aliens/demons

  I was fully onboard this story while I was catching up to it, but now that I'm reading chapters as they come I'm less so. It hasn't gotten worse or anything, I think it's just that the story is not optimized for the serial medium. Regardless, I recommend it. I do wish there was more clever usage and experimentation of powers.

  Summary: the martian, only in space

  Not much to say. This is a page turner with a lot of interesting scifi ideas and I read it one sitting(rip sleep). Not deep or thoughtful or anything, just a good popcorn read that you can tell people "the book version is better" in a few years, once it's inevitably adapted to film. If I absolutely had to find one complaint I would first of all reject the premise of your demand, and second of all you aren't my daddy/mommy.

  Recommended: no

  I normally love kingdom/base building stories, but this one missed the mark for me. In large part it's because it's sloppily structured, there's no proper plot, and the characters are pretty thin, just the MC and her lackey. >90% of the dialogue is between these 2 people, and most of it is of the 'le witty banter' variety, which I despise. 

  The setting is actually interesting and well thought out, definitely has potential and is the best part about the story. But it's also pretty grim, so when every exchange has a lighthearted jibe or playful jab or humorous call back... it's constant tonal whiplash, IMO, which I don't like.

  Summary: generic chosen one/demon lord plot(sans isekai), only there are 5 chosen ones, and 1 of them(the MC, obvs) gets a useless camp follower power. Or is it?

  This was recommended on the subreddit last month with only like 15k words out, and I passed on it at the time. Now that it has over 100k, I read half of whats out before dropping it. It's not terrible, but it does feel like another generic novice effort, with no trace of originality or passion. It's like the author read every popular story in the progression fantasy 'genre' with a pen and pad in hand, and is now going through the list of tropes, shoving them haphazardly into his own story. 

  That said, I fully expect him to be making 10k a month on patreon soon. (jk, jk... or am I?).

  A ASoIaF self-insert with a heavy emphasis on kingdom building. This would normally be right in my wheelhouse, but the story embodies all the worse SI tropes. 

  tl;dr: the SI is a perfect little mary sue. He knows everything that's useful, everyone that's useful loves or respects him, and all his enemies are one-dimensional idiots. Actually, absolutely everyone is pretty much an idiot, on a society wide level. I know that planetos doesn't need any help not making sense(i.e. a feudal country the size of the continent of Africa where everyone speaks the same language and winters can randomly last years) but this guy takes it a bit too far with all the low hanging fruit he picks up. 

  I could even stomach all of that, but the author is just a complete novice. He'll spend 20k words and 5 POV changes on 1 event, all of them inevitably brown-nosing the SI for how clever/intelligent/whatever he is. Isn't the author the SI? So in effect, the ass he's kissing is... his own?

    Really great content, lists like these always deserve to be commended, so, kudos. 

    I will say that Mark of the Fool, which I too was disappointed with in its first 'arc' has improved a lot since arriving at the school. It feels more settled in its pace and the writer has finally hit his stride.

    - u/GlueBoy:
      ```
      Thanks! 

      As to Mark of the Fool, what would you say improves? A big problem I had was the shoddy decisions the MC kept making. It wasn't just one or two, pretty much all his decisions are bad but seemingly framed as good by the writer(e.g when he takes his little sister into the dungeon). I can overlook a lot of bad writing, but when I can't tell if the character is being written as a dumbass(which is fine) or if the writer is one, my threshold is immediately surpassed.
      ```

      - u/Ricardias:
        ```
        The problem I had was similar but, it that the MC was making a lot of decisions through the lense of getting to the magic school even when it stopped making sense for him to do so because thats where the author wanted him to go. 

        There's nothing wrong with writing this way as long as you put the pieces together organically. The author failed to do this. 

        However now he is at the school, the MCs decision making is more organic because the author is not chasing a plot state. Plus, now the story has slowed down there has been much more time for worldbuilding that sets the world apart from that kitchen sink it was in the beginning.
        ```

      - u/AcceptableBook:
        ```
        I don't know if it helps, but I feel like them all going into the dungeon could have simply been because the author wanted to explain a major plot point. There are major long term consequences to going in the dungeon, and I'd say that he eventually starts making better choices. Not necessarily good ones, but he hasn't made any choice that's as bad as going into a dungeon with his little sister yet. The exploration of his powers does get more creative, but I don't know if it'll be worth it for you to read the story just for that.

    Mark of the Fool is weird. MC has an incredibly OP power which has no apparently downside to being used and still he just only uses it in very narrow specific situations. For a fic that's seamingly about transcending your limits there's some kind of dissonance.
    ```

    - u/Do_Not_Go_In_There:
      ```
      There are limitations; the Mark will screw with any attempt to do something combat/magic related. Not impossible - the MC proves that you can get around this, but it take an enormous amount if self-control or getting inventive in what "combat" is defined as. But it's still incredibly useful for literally everything else. Why it's viewed as useless I don't really get because it can make the perfect support character in a party. 

      That said, the latest chapters reveal that >!you can use meditation to get around the limits imposed by the mark!< meaning that it has unlimited potential now.
      ```

      - u/Sonderjye:
        ```
        Yes, the limitations are clearly defined and I omitted them because I wanted to avoid spoilers. My point is that under areas in which the mark is clearly shown to work he doesn't spam it. 

        For instance >!he used it on the guards to lie better!< so we know that it works in social situations but he hardly ever uses that despite this actually both improving his future intrinsic and marked abilities in those situations. Another instance is that money is one of the plot pressures and he doesn't even try to use it to make money. 

        I would talk about low hanging fruits but we're lower than that. He doesn't spam it on things that he already knows it works on and it just frustrates me.
        ```

        - u/steelong:
          ```
          None of those are things he really needs to do *now* though.  He has enough money to last a few years, and he's taking >!potions classes in part because he thinks it'll synergize with his mark as a way to make money.!<

          As for lying, I would imagine most people would be uncomfortable artificially inflating their own ability to be dishonest.  It definitely wouldn't be the one most people would go to immediately, especially when they're attending a school of magic.  He'll probably end up doing that naturally anyway >!because of that one annoying zealot classmate.!<

          - u/Sonderjye:

            Maybe you're right about the money thing. I don't remember the details of that part.

            Of course he needs to lie - a man with an axe who wants to kill his friend might appear at his door and what's he then to do?

            Jokes aside the mark seems to work on any kind of social situation, including posturing and tone, and learning how to speak your case is only not crucial in those solo survival stories. He is talking to people and trying to guess their intentions, and he is shooting himself in the foot by not spamming it. Maybe, as you suggest, he would be uncomfortable using it on people, but in that case I would be expecting him to at the very least have an internal debate around it.
            ```

            - u/SpeakKindly:
              ```
              I think the reason it no longer seems strange that he doesn't do it is that by the most recent story arc, it's no longer a survival story. It's a comedy about college student stereotypes with fantasy world-building thrown in.

    It's fine if you don't like the story, but people raised in those environments did in fact write about how fucked up the sexism and gender roles and slavery was. Shit, two of the biggest *contemporary* criticisms of Plato's Republic were that it's fundamentally based on slave labor (thus levying the purportedly modern critique against him, those thousands of years ago), and that he was being more or less a radical proto-feminist by having men and women be basically equals (thus levying himself a purportedly modern critique against society).

    There's no requirement to justify your dislike of a web serial, but if you're going to, please don't engage in some sort of revisionist apologia for the awfulness of those times, because in all of those times people damn well knew and talked about the fact that it sucked and was wrong.

            Thanks! I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or not, but I feel like I should maybe help you out a bit.

            The argument here was against the idea that people who are raised in a patriarchal/sexist/racist environment are unable to question or think outside those parameters. This is plainly  false, we have plenty of examples of people questioning the conditions of their contemporary society.

            Now, just because some people held a different attitude doesn't mean conditions would change. Why is that? Well, a majority of people could hold the patriarchal view (for instance), or the local ruler or power structure might have reasons for enforcing certain conditions. This doesn't mean that everyone thinks like that, or that people are incapable of questioning those conditions. And arguing this doesn't mean that  "people's attitudes were the same historically as they are now."

            The last thing about Judaism you also interpreted weirdly. The point wasn't that everyone was a feminist before the Common Era, the point was that (as someone has pointed out), the past is not uniform. We can't  graph something like "relative freedom of women" and expect it to be a constant upward curve. Things vary between time periods, cultures, and social classes. To say that 'in the past, things were much worse because people didn't know any better,' is reductive and doesn't lead to nuanced understandings (or portrayals!) of complex social issues.
            ```

      - u/Izeinwinter:
        ```
        The past was not uniform is the main thing. 

        A lot of medieval -smiths taught their wives their trade, for example, because unlike an apprentice, a wife would not run off and become a competitor, and a smithing shop could afford to hire the household chores done. This in turn lead to quite considerable numbers of female blacksmiths when they outlived and inherited their husbands. 

        But you dont see "The local master smith is a muscular granny with three apprentices" much in fiction. 

        Universal female emancipation is very much a child of electricity, and the attendant mechanization of household work. The electric hotplate, the fridge, the iron, the washing machine. These transformed housekeeping from a literal full time job to something you could do in your spare time. 

        Before that, it was only ever something that happened in social classes that could afford to hire that done, but were also not inclined to maintain their women in idleness as a show of conspicuous consumption. But it did happen.

        Edit: Even the social classes and times/places that did expect women to be housekeepers accorded that position *wildly* varying levels of respect. Ranging from treating women as sub human, to wives running all the household finances, with men on basically an allowance.

            A rough answer would be USSR and Nazi Germany, who practiced slavery even after europe soured on it after the Colonial Era, and Colonialism itself, where Africans went from distant people who occasionally were traded with to subjects of imperial conquest.

    > Summary: the martian, only in space

    This was actually my biggest dislike of the book.

    If you took the martian and then removed all the actual plot details, but left the conflict points on a timeline you'd have an identical copy of Project Hail Mary. 

    It felt formulaic and not actually suspenseful nor was there ever any question about any event or crisis.

    >Only Villains Do That

    Not sure if you knew, but the author of this is also the author of "[The Gods Are Bastards](https://tiraas.net/table-of-contents/)." It definitely is a different feel than that work, although I'm not sure if I prefer the shift or not - sorta feels like he uses the new story to explore themes/personalities/issues he felt he couldn't in TGAB. 

    I'm wondering if you read the previous work, and how you feel it compares to OVDT so far?

    I’m not sure how strongly rational, rationalist, or rationalist-adjacent this story is, but it definitely fits your listed criteria.

    A Long Journey Home

    https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9860311/1/A-Long-Journey-Home

    The story will make more sense if you’re at least somewhat familiar with the setting of the Harry Potter universe.

    I think it is very well written, but it is regrettably incomplete and likely abandoned, with the last chapter being posted in March 2017.

    Titans by Edward W Robertson matches your description, but it's a strange book and I hesitate to recommend it. Readers here will probably find its depiction of an AI rebellion naive, and I found it more memorable for its historical flashbacks than for the sci-fi parts, but still the main character was quite well written as somebody truly ancient and comfortable with it.

  [Castle Kingside](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/43462/castle-kingside-rewrite) is back from hiatus. The author was unsatisfied with how the first volume ended up and like ~15%-20% from the end, so disappeared to do a rewrite and editing pass. Its putting out about 4 chapters a day until it catches back up to where it was, which was something like 80 or 90 chapters total iirc. 

  Its been a while since I've read it, but the short version is that Actual Qualified Medical Professional Protagonist gets isekai'd to a reasonably grim medieval fantasy world with nothing but the clothes on his back. There's an arc of finding his feet while homeless, penniless, and clueless to start everything off, but it eventually starts transitioning into hitting some uplift beats, which is where I think the story is going, whilst also having your standard isekai conflict and monsters stuff. The grim-ness wasn't just for the sake of being macabre, he's trying to give healthcare to people whose best understanding of medicine is a step above superstition half the time, so there's horrible diseases and treatments happening there.

  I thought it was decent overall, and quite above average for the standard Royalroad fare, although it didn't 100% click with my interests since uplift stuff always feels a bit off to me whenever I try it, and the more action heavy scenes didn't feel weighty enough, which isn't that bad given they weren't the priority for the story themes. The whole "qualified doctor trying to isekai macguiver medicine" thing is the draw, and well done.

    Wildbow's latest work [Pale](https://palewebserial.wordpress.com/about/) is set in a magic world where several otherworldly realms exist, among them the Paths. Practitioners who traverse these realms are now called Finders, but earlier appelations include "Chaos Mage" and "Dream Mage", because those realms seem usually dreamlike and grant those who make it through strange and unpredictable boons. Those Finders organize in communities and work together to figure out the rules to Paths, trading for secret routes and then exploiting the rewards. If you want a look into one Path without spoiling yourself on the story proper, you can read the guide to the [Forest Ribbon Trail](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ti2MftECN9PloDlHdjTGlMbwXPxf0GGOyNl-c4OYKCs/edit).

    One of the story's main characters starts leaning heavily into that Practise.

      While *Pale* is almost incomparably amazing and I support any recommendations of it in the strongest possible terms, it should be noted that Paths have very limited screentime in it. Indeed, they take up about three-and-a-half chapters out of ~100, so far.

      If *Pale*'s premise sounds even vaguely interesting, u/Krakenarrior, you should still try it. But if you're absolutely opposed, and yet interested in the Paths, you could try reading the FRT guide u/BavarianBarbarian_ linked, then [this chapter](https://palewebserial.wordpress.com/2020/07/07/stolen-away-2-9/) alone. You *probably* would be able to figure out what's going on.

  I'm looking for a novel that fits a general theme. Something like Mother of Learning, where characters work together to face off against a major threat, mostly relying on their knowledge and cooperation to find a method to deal with it. If anyone has read With This Ring, I was also very drawn to the teaser they had about an alternate version of the main character in the Warhammer universe trying to organize a campaign against the chaos gods, which, from what I know about that story, would be a very ambitious goal that would take a lot of work and research to ever reach. Some other notables I've liked are the Trash of the Count's Family and Ending Maker, but these were more about collecting all the powerful things as opposed to research.

    Worm fits that only tangentially, but the fanfic [El-Ahrairah](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/el-ahrairah-worm.372987/) does so much more directly. Instead of the power from canon, Taylor gains the ability to recognize other people's Shards and sort-of read from them. In short order, she's figured out Cauldron, and joins them in preparing the world for the final war. It seems to be dead, but it's come back from long hiatuses before.

    The stuff you're complaining about becomes a major focus of the story later on.

    In the early chapters, the MC is still basically a kid who grew up on the heavy propaganda of a militaristic country that's been at war for generations, and the story is told through the eyes of this unreliable narrator. Over time the worldbuilding ramps up and Li Yao starts to get a better understanding of how things really work. In a few story arcs he finds himself >!on the run from a nation-wide manhunt, carrying an offer of surrender from the Blood Demon Sector that many powerful actors who benefit from the war don't want delivered.!< The story's cynically analytical view of politics just ramps up from there.

        It gets toned down a bit - the train scene is a very extreme example, where people who could easily run away lay down their lives *very inefficiently* as opposed to, say, engaging in glorious combat with a chance of death.

        The moral philosophy of the Cultivators in the later part of the novel still definitely says "you should stay and fight and risk your life for people who cannot defend themselves", but it does not get taken to extremes as much (and even in the Star Glory Federation, not everyone actually does this).

The first 100 chapters are very poor - I think I bounced off them twice before finally powering through on continuing reccomendactions the third time - and not really emblematic of the rest of it, although it’s more of a begins seriously improving ~100 than a instant quality.

  - u/plutonicHumanoid:
    ```
    Not really on topic for the thread, no?

    God gives Bruce some constraints (can’t reveal it to anyone, can’t affect free will) in the movie, so he could have more in the fic. Like explicitly limiting his sphere of influence to Buffalo to limit the scope of the story. Also, explaining exactly how his powers work would be necessary.

    I’m not really sure what the “point” would be. In the movie, Bruce... learns to trust in God, or something, and voluntarily gives up his powers. I don’t really remember and I’m not really understanding it from the Wikipedia summary. I guess something like that would still work, with Bruce being overwhelmed with trying to maximize the happiness everyone, and his inevitable failure to do that.

  This is possibly (or probably) off-topic, but asking here seems better than as a separate post.

  I'd like to find rational *analyses* of non-rational fictional works.

  I've been watching a lot of the 'pitch meeting' videos on the [Screen Rant YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/ScreenRant/featured). In particular, watching the [A Quiet Place](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjFdjG2V_zc) and [Bird Box](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgtFNtYGAzw) pitch meeting videos made me want to read a comprehensive analysis of both, particular from a rational/rationalist/munchkinry perspective.

  The closest thing I can think of would be someone posting a 'rational version of' question here (and the subsequent comments). Would that be acceptable here generally? Even if the asker didn't seriously intend to actually write a rational/rationalist version of the relevant fictional work?

  This *kind* of thing is a pretty popular genre of critique! But I really want a rational/rationalist version.

  Is anyone aware of any existing sources/venues for this kind of thing?

  More generally, I have become very much a fan of works that use fictional works to discuss broader scientific/academic/rational theories and ideas, e.g. history, economics. Using existing (and accessible) fictional works seems like a *really* powerful way to discuss those theories/ideas in concrete detail.
