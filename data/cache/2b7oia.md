- u/traverseda:
  ```
  Act 1 is about the "[holding out for a hero](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoldingOutForAHero)" trope mostly.
  ```

  - u/Ulmaxes:
    ```
    Specifically an incredibly brutal deconstruction of the trope, complete with 1984 references on the crowd's part.
    ```

- u/Ulmaxes:
  ```
  It also taps lightly on fascism- how it can supplant the existing government: works up the people into blaming an issue on a false scapegoat, then blaming the current government for not doing enough to deal with it.

  I also love listening to this right after Act 1, as the first track of Act 2 feels like a precursor to the ultimate confrontation that happens at the end of Act 1.
