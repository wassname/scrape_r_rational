## Story about the downsides of first contact

### Post:

Pretty funny actually, alien on a paradise planet, galactic community names him leader of his world, he hates the job. Tries various things to get the beaurocracy to leave him alone.
sorry for the terseness, I'm on mobile, anyone have a clue? there was a bunch of these stories, it might have been a web serial? Posted a few months ago, possibly here?

On his world, being leader is symbolized by a shell on your door.
