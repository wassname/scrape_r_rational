## Looking for a partner or two to bounce ideas and possibly help write a Star Wars/LotR rational mashup

### Post:

Sorry if there's a sub for this sort of thing. I've been drawing up plans for what a star wars/lord of the rings mashup would look like, and I think I could write it, but I'd like to maybe get a partner or two to help.

This would basically be like the Almalgram comics, but written in a rational style (so worm-style over HPMOR-style). The adventures of Luke Starstrider, Han Frodo, and Obi-wandalf as they combat the evils of the Darth-King and his Sithwraiths.

Would anyone be interested? It will probably happen regardless, but I'd like to see if going in as a joint venture would help speed it up.

  We have BST (brainstorming) tags. Please use them, for future posterity. 

  Joint-writing usually works best between two old friends who are in tune with each other's work ethic, habits, mannerisms, inspirations, vision, tastes, styles, etc. It's not impossible for something to happen over the internet but is much harder, not faster.

  I love the concept, but you might be better off on your own.

  Could you tell me some more about the setting? I think I get the idea of combining the characters, but I can't really see how this would all fit together.
