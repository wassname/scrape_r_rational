  Every once in a long while, a character just says what I'm thinking.

   *‹Prince Jake, you speak as if you still intend to maintain control.  As if you believe control is a thing that is possible.  You know how the Ellimist works.  You know you cannot outmaneuver it...*

   *‹An invalid question,› Ax countered.  ‹There are many things which seem possible which never were, in fact...*

  *...The path you imagined us to be on is not real.  We were never on it.  We were on this path—always, from the beginning—and simply did not know it until now. ..* 

  Thank you, Ax.  Somebody had to say it, and you were the one allowing himself to see the obvious.

  Yay! I know that Cassie is a charged topic in the Animorphs fandom. But it is nice to see her perspective juxtaposed with the perspective of Jake. 

  Also: Cassie is young and may not know this already, but having difficulty living up to one’s morals or ideals does not undermine the virtue of *adopting* those ideals.

  Ahh, *finally*, I can stop pointing out to people that Cassie's death wasn't some cataclysmic blow to the Ellimist's plan, but was in fact part of it all along! Excellent!

  For real though, Cassie being *shielded* from the brutal forward march of the war is a really, really interesting angle. Hopefully her arrival is in time to pull Jake back from the pitch-dark brink he's standing on; preliminarily, things are looking hopeful on that front.

  I wasn't prepared for how much that coldness from Jake was going to bite. Seeing it from Cassie's perspective, both because it was directed *at* Cassie and because of the lens of her empathy, made it that much sharper. Then the breaking sense of relief from Helium's warmth was unexpected all over again.

  CouteauBleu (not tagging you - I don't want to show up in your inbox with a picnic basket full of spoilers - but I know you're out there) neither one of us was *completely* right about Marco's motivations for shooting Cassie, but I reserve the right to feel all full of myself 'cause I was a little closer. Uh... Is it cool if I say "nah-nah na-boo-boo?"

  As for the Author's Note, funny that it mentions the end of Chapter 14. In that chapter, Esplin lists four street addresses plus "*The playground at Magnuson park*," which I had always taken to mean the Animorphs' home addresses and, like, the place where Tobias hangs out. But in this chapter, Chapter 46, Cassie lists her address as "*number 11, Apple Canyon Road*," which isn't among the addresses in Chapter 14. Another TKSU? Or am I wrong about what the addresses in 14 mean? Either way, I'll probably brainstorm a couple entries for the "contest" when I'm at my computer later.

  That conversation in the barn with Marco that Cassie mentions - that's exactly the spot I keep getting distracted from as I annotate Chapter 4. Huh. (Might as well plug /r/Ranimorphs here - it's pretty empty right now, but it's where I've been posting annotated chapters as I make them, and it's open to all posts about the fic!)

  Take your time on the back half, Author! Make a chapter you're proud of - in fact, let *all* the remaining chapters be ones you're proud of. We've waited twelve years in Azkaban for this fic to wrap up; we can wait a few extra days for it to wrap up right. ;)
  ```

    ```
    It's the addresses of:

    1417 Bayview Drive (Rachel)

    88E South Church Street (Jake)

    209 Aspen Avenue (Oak Landing)

    3555 Franklin Court (Marco)

    Cassie's address wasn't relevant, because her parents had already been taken.  =/
    ```

    - u/Quibbloboy:
      ```
      Ahh, I see. I ought to know by know that it's hardly ever a mistake, even when it looks like one.

      More importantly, that means the Magnuson playground was...

      *Entire Work, Ctrl+F, "Magnuson"*

      ...Rachel's meeting spot with the Chee. So the Visser was there, probably, and he really has been courting (coercing, blackmailing, whatever) the Chee from the very, very beginning. Probably.

      Wonderful!

  I'm ready to make my guess as to the basic shape of the conclusion of the story.  This is either wildly premature, or embarrassingly late to the party, depending, but why not, here goes.

  The basic structure of what we have going on here is the Belgariad/Mallorean notion of choosing between good and evil, with the rat twist that the hard part of picking between good and evil is telling them apart.  The Crayak/Elimist are ultimately betting on a single decision that the Animorphs will make in response to this absurd situation (Infinite babies are killing infinite babies and only the Devil can help you!).

  Last time, I thought that would be about the Howler's likely having infected humanity with a lethal phage before their main attack.  On further reflection, I don't think that's how it shakes out.  The actual decision that the Gods care about is just the obvious one, give the cube to V3 or destroy it.

  Their interventions are meant to prohibit V3 from simply stealing the cube, and also to eliminate humanity as an easy way to short circuit the decision.  That is, to remove 'which is best for those like us' as a heuristic that dominates the choice they are supposed to be making.

  In further updates, it will become blatantly obvious that humanity as they know it is already gone and not coming back.  It has been purged by the Howlers or overwritten by V3, but either way the status quo antebellum is dead and gone.

  It will also become obvious that V3's composure, the way it thinks it is playing with house money here, is wildly incorrect.  It thinks it can make the virophage and annihilate the Howlers, or at the very least just put a few more minefields back to back.  None of that will work without the cube.  I dunno if its network has already been infected, or it is just wrong about the wider state of play, but V3 will be brought to the realization that its victory depends entirely on these kids and their choices.

  V3 is recognizably a paperclipper/seeing-like-a-state/authoritarian analog.  Choosing it is to choose Adult Supervision.  It is, aside from a few fishtanks it is forced to maintain, to give all negentropy into the hands of a being which considers using those suns to light worlds to be wasteful.  One universe, under Crayak, with liberty and justice for one, Aeat.

  The Howlers are the other option, nature/market red in tooth and claw.  They are a parody of the distributed nightmare of no control being remotely possible.  They are anonymous shouting screeds, punching wildly in all directions while proclaiming that to fight back is to 'punch down'.  Elimist as Bill Cipher, and the universe a howling void of anarchy and murder for all time.  SSC's joke that the last post on the far future internet would be someone calling someone else a pedo made grimly literal.

  At a further guess, since I'm so far out on this limb I can barely see the starting point, the Animorphs will ultimately choose V3.  Their bargain with it will stand in for getting the Friendly AI's Utility Function correct, and the finale will be roughly the same as it was for the honest option in Three Worlds Collide. >!"They all lived happily ever after."!<

  She’s back! For some reason I assumed that Cassie was intervening because she felt that trying to deal with Visser Three was inherently wrong. But her trying to save the Howlers makes more sense. Now I’m imagining a wholesome version of the Howlers who get their novelty by traveling the galaxy and playing different sports 

  I’m interested to see where this goes because I probably would take the deal with Visser. I simply don’t see a way out, or a way to change the Howlers before humanity goes extinct

  Edit: I loved this line too. 

  > Not until after the critical moment—after I’d seen Jake, about to shake hands with the devil, and found myself shouting out Stop

   I love religious imagery and themes in works, and while they don’t fit with this piece this line was perfect. Making a deal with this V3 really is like dealing with the devil, with consequences just as predictable. Even when they said they were going to take the deal they didn’t think he would be true to his word, and that he would trick them somehow

  Also interesting to see the implied back and forth with the gods and Cassie. One manipulated her into essentially committing suicide, the other intervened by preserving her in Z space and bringing her back, then the other potentially intervened by having Marco (who was in morph?) shoot her, only for Rachel who “wasn’t supposed to be there” to stop him
  ```

  - u/CouteauBleu:
    ```
    Yeah, I'd still pick the "genocide" option.

    Sorry, Howlers, but it's you or us, and it's not our responsibility to educate you while you're busy slaughtering us.

    Honestly I wouldn't even have wasted the time talking it out with Cassie.

    My read is that these were the same.

  I think I see where this is going. Cassie thinks killing the Howlers with a quantum virus would be wrong...but what about a memetic virus? I'm thinking how they were defeated in canon, by Jake kissing Cassie and the memory propagating into the shared mind. No one else on the team, who are all traumatized and exhausted, would be able to conceive of such an idea...except Cassie.
  ```

  - u/strategyzrox:
    ```
    Following this line of thought, How would one spread this memetic virus? You'd need to make the howlers aware that non-howlers have subjective experiences.

    Perhaps the animorphs give the morphing power to a howler?
    ```

    - u/KnickersInAKnit:
      ```
      Could probably use the 'backdoor', which notably Cassie also first discovered
      ```

  - u/Meriipu:
    ```
    Are howlers distracted by anything novel?
    What about one TV-screen per Howler that show random data kind of like how some of those reinforcement learners stop in the spot to look at the TV screen forever?

    Not sincerely though, it would be a cheap cop-out more fit for a crack fic.

      V3 is trying stuff like this, and it isn't working.  Good thought.

  > “It means that it’s wrong to kill them,” I said softly.  Softly, but not with any doubt.  I wasn’t sure why I was there, yet, but I was sure that I was there, and there was only one answer I could give to that question.  “Not if there’s any other way—any other way at all.”

  Yes Cassie, but also no, it is wrong to kill them in an important sense but in another important sense they are doing a lot of killing and worse themselves and it is *less bad* to kill them than not to.

  The different approaches to godly manipulation are interesting.

  * Helium's seems to be: you have no real control here, so "ride the wave". I guess that means roughly, try to survive, retain what resources you can, act sensibly in the short-term, but don't stay attached to your long-term plans. Taken to an extreme this might suggest never making long-term plans at all, but I don't feel like Helium would take it that far or suggest taking it that far.
  * As Helium points out, Jake seems to be trying to fight for control, to keep moving forward with his plans.
  * Cassie... seems to assume the Ellimist's plan is one she wants to go along with? I guess she's seen a lot less that would give her reason to think otherwise. Having assumed that, she works out what she's supposed to do based on what kind of person she is. Like, "what would I do here? I'd do X. Okay, let's do X". Which is...

  In Greg Egan's *Diaspora*, there's an exchange where one character wants to convince another to do something. The other decides that the first is likely to convince ver, and goes along with the idea on that basis. Which sounds kind of weird, but also I've totally done that. ("I don't really feel like doing that." "What would it take to convince you?" "Good question. Hm. Not much, I guess. Okay, sure, let's do it.") Cassie's thought process here reminded me of that.

  I feel like, if you're playing against someone who can predict your every move, the thing to do is *change what kind of pawn you are*. Your opponent isn't necessarily omnipotent - the Ellimist couldn't beat me at tic-tac-toe, and there's some number of stones handicap where he couldn't beat me at Go. (He could directly intervene to force a bad move from me, but that's fighting the metaphor and also not really beating *me*.) So you act in such a way that: given that your actions are completely predictable, in this situation and all hypotheticals; and given that your opponent is going to maximize their score; then your opponents best score is as good for you as possible.

  (Oh, I guess this is basically (according to my limited understanding) functional decision theory?)

  When you have no idea what the rules are or what most of the gameboard even looks like, Helium's approach feels like it's probably not optimal but a decent heuristic?

    ...Assuming that killing them is the only way to stop them.

    Indeed, killing them to stop them > not stopping them, but stopping them **without** killing them >>> killing them to stop them.
    ```

    - u/philh:
      ```
      Agreed, but... you have to weight that by how likely you are to be able to achieve that. I feel like “Not if there’s any other way—any other way at all” isn't doing that. 

      Though, I could be being too hard on Cassie here.

      * I don't actually know that she doesn't have an idea for how to achieve it.
      * I think if a philh said those words, it would be because he's making the mistake I'm complaining about. A Cassie might say those words for a different reason, so they mean a slightly different thing.

        It seems to me like this is the whole reason that Cassie is here, which is a good reason to suspect that it will work.  But that sword has to cut two ways.  From past chapters, it seems like something like this could only happen if the Ellimist **and** Crayak agreed upon it.

        If I had to guess where the narrative is going, Cassie was brought back to keep them from exterminating the Howlers, because that will be  the win condition (or will make the win condition inevitable).  If they can stop the Howlers without killing them, the Ellimist wins.  If the Howlers exterminate humanity, then Crayak wins.  The quantum virus, on the other hand, doesn't further either of their goals.

        The alternative is that Cassie's presence contributes to the Ellimist's victory, and the boy from the pool contributes to Crayak's (or vice versa).

          I'm not so sure. We saw one player spending game resources to carefully maneuver Cassie into stasis before the war could change her. We saw with the field trip to the Hork-Bajir world that when They both want something, they can use basically unlimited game resources. Meanwhile the player they meet at the pool was carefully conserving [# of atoms x distance teleported] budget.

            The avatar says the next time they talk to him that one of them wanted Cassie dead and the other permitted it, which could point to it being a joint action in some way (the avatar says he can't lie (but can he?)).

            Edit: Maybe he means that the other didn't try to thwart it.
            ```

            - u/daytodave:
              ```
              We have Word of God from the author that the gods (speaking through the Avatar) are capable of "wizard's lies". I.e. they can say things in misleading or convoluted ways, but they can't deliberately say anything they know isn't true.

              I think all moves that aren't equally wanted by both Players are "proposed by one and ratified by the other". I don't remember which conversation that was, but I think  the Avatar said something that implied that pretty strongly, and it seems to fit the point of the game, which  is to give the Gods a way to fight each Other without destroying the universe in a cosmic race-to-the-bottom
              ```

              - u/None:
                ```
                They don't exactly say that (what has been "ratified" are the initial conditions of the game). But by Occam's razor, you're probably right - otherwise, there'd be three categories of moves - unilaterally done, done by one and ratified by the other, and done jointly.

                (It's also possible one of the E/C duo could've prevented the other from killing Cassie by making their own move in the game, and that might be what the Avatar means by the other "permitting" it. (Edit: But that doesn't sound really likely, even though who knows.))

  These chapters are getting increasingly weird.

  Also, it feels like we're fast approaching the "Avengers Endgame" part of the story, where the only way it can possibly move forward is coming back in time and cancelling all the "extinction of everything the protagonists and audience care about" stuff.

  I mean, on the one hand this fic has been pretty strong about sticking to consequences of events and stuff, but on the other hand we *do* know time travel is on the table, sooooo...
  ```

  - u/TK17Studios:
    ```
    Canon sprinkled the Ellimist weirdness throughout, and also acted as if it shouldn't be mind-shatteringly disorienting.  I just kinda ... *smooshed* it, all toward the end.
    ```

    - u/CouteauBleu:
      ```
      Oh yeah. Everworld kinda had that too, where every now and then the characters go "Wait, isn't it *weird* that we're in a world where every human myth is true and also magic was real all along and science was a lie?", but they never *act* on it (except that one time they accidentally an industrial revolution).

    I honestly expected it to be like [Chapter P](https://archiveofourown.org/works/6178036/chapters/14574775) in Cordyceps (which also features PoV characters' names as chapter titles) back when this chapter was first announced.
    ```

      That was an absolutely heartless way to end that story.

      I approve.

    Not necessarily; this fic has shown stuff from the past before.

      Oh - I haven't read the past dozen or so updates so I haven't seen that yet (or maybe I'm forgetting), but I did read Cassie's last update so the name was an instant flag.
