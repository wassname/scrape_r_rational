  For the record, this attack is well known in programmer circles as the [Ken Thompson hack](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?TheKenThompsonHack).

  [edit] Though they jump to AI too fast, instead of considering that somebody maybe built a working [Supercompiler](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?SuperCompiler).

  [edit edit] The ridicule is unrealistic. Surely people on Slashdot would have heard of the Ken Thompson hack. Add all the paranoia that already exists around the NSA... One wonders how far this virus has gotten.

  > but then the mindless flipping through output code side-by-side with the original, looking for signs of tampering.

  jesus christ dude, use diff -r

  [edit] Okay, the switch is scary.

  [edit] > We had to stop the perpetrators before they modified hardware disk interfaces

  You know, this is already possible! Google around, some people did it on a lark. Hard disks contain a small ARM chip with firmware nowadays.

  In summary: good story by somebody who sounds like they independently rediscovered an attack that has been known for decades. Props to the author! But the virus that can evade a team of dedicated hobbyists with logic probes has (probably) yet to be written.

  This story is very cool. Though there are some errors in the technical details, simply having all of those technical details is enough to make this massively entertaining. The switch instills genuine terror in my gut.

  I was overthinking it by the end... Are there any machines they can trust, which they haven't built themselves? Did the worm see their post on Slashdot, and filter out any useful responses? Does it control the mic on their telephones, and listen to their every word?

  Maybe not yet, but in five or six iterations, we'll see.

  Not terribly realistic - if it's clever enough to do complex conditional logic, it's also big enough to get caught.  I don't think a sneaky rate of evolution is compatible with the rate of change of computing stacks, let alone the problem that most evolved solutions don't work!

  That said - as a Python user with no compsci training, the thought of having to rebuild everything from assembly by hand is totally and rationally horrifying.

    Yeah, I was expecting them to find out that all those mocking posts were written by suspiciously chatbot-like accounts...
    ```

      ```
      Maybe the chatbot-like accounts only lasted the first couple of times, and by the point of the story those, too, have become more advanced. 

      Half of Slashdot's active community is actually just sophisticated programs talking back and forth to each other in order to maintain a tight illusion of humanity. After all, if 100 *really well-written* posts attack yours, and don't seem to have much other history, then you might be suspicious. But what if each of them has a history going back years? Then you assume that they're human.

        ```
        The comment history is stored on databases, too. The bots may have been there for years... but were they there for years *yesterday*?

          I just so happened to be reading *Soul Music* and came across this quote. Ahh, what a lovely coincidence.

  - u/FeepingCreature:
    ```
    This sort of bootstrapping is honestly actually fairly manageable, to the extent that we make students do it as exercise. Assembler sounds scary, but you only need to write _one_ compiler in Assembler, and all it has to be capable of doing is build a slightly more powerful compiler. (Actually, write an interpreter instead. Preferably for a Lisp. Who needs compilers?)

    Hell, having to go into the compiler is horrifying to me, and I have five years in the field. I'm sure that I could do it, if I had to, but doing that to track down a persistent and unexplainable bug? No thank you.
