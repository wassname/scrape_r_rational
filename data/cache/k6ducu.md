  According to your description it wasn't a spell we saw able to achieve this but a curse. There is therefore the possibility that the necessary components for a spell that returns a soul to a vampire is deep personal hatred for the vampire in question and deep pain from the recent death of a loved one.

  As an aside, if there is a creator god in the buffyverse it is obviously a sadistic one. It would fit its profile if it made it so the only one who could restore a vampire's soul is someone who hates it personally.

  Yeah. it's always a problem with vampires in stories like buffy. I will point out that the resouling ritual does seem like very dangerous high magic as Giles couldn't cast it, and it seemed to be very risky for the caster. It also may not really be modifiable as even Willow just recast it instead of removing the "one moment of true happiness" caveat.

    Fairy tale logic. Curses always have an end condition, and the cursed person has to know it. I think Willow could have stuck a different condition on it, but curses without one just do not work.

    More importantly, curses may also absolutely require you to be a deserving target.

  My main issue with rat!fics like these is that assuming an entire setting is stupid is irrational in and of itself, especially when there are hints of in-setting explanations for why people do things already.
