## [RT] Mother of Learning discussion: time loop power source (spoilers)

### Post:

With the information provided by the Guardian in chapter 55 about the operation of the loop, I've been thinking a bit about its power requirements and source. There are several fascinating/baffling/important points that seem to be worthy of input from the great minds around here.

First up - this thing has *so much power* available that even in a premature, inefficient loop like this one, it still manages to recreate the world over 1000 times. We don't know how far the effect extends, but we can presume it's the entire planet at a minimum, and probably more. That includes all the mana wells; the Gate has recreated *the Hole* over 1000 times. Presumably it has recreated the very heart of the world, the source of all ambient mana. So when Zorian suspects that the Maker must have been a god, I think there can be no doubt. Anyone who could do that would quickly become a god, Morrowind-style, if they weren't already.

Second, it occurred to me that the length of time inside the loop is actually supposed to be *greater* than the 400 years *between* loops. We can't be certain of the reliability of the legend that claimed the first emperor spent "11 lifetimes" there, but 1000 iterations > 80 years if utilised fully, and the Guardian made it clear that this particular loop is decaying "far more rapidly than it is supposed to." So the legend is probably about right. And if we make a highly conservative estimate that 1 lifetime = 50 years, then that's 550 years of time loop, requiring an absolute minimum of 6600 iterations (probably more; he would have died early sometimes). 

So, if the Gate is continually gathering power during the intervening centuries, then each iteration represents about 3 weeks of charging time. Where could it possibly get that much power from? Cosmic radiation of some kind? Could that even be enough? Or is the power source something more local? If so, then it should be available inside the loop, so that in theory it could recharge *from the looping world itself*...

Or, if it's not a 400-year-long recharge, then perhaps we're looking at some kind of huge energy input from the planar alignment. But that would presumably leave open the possibility of multiple activations throughout the 2-month alignment period. Which doesn't seem likely, when we're already in Arc 3 of the story. Also, the Guardian didn't say that there was less power *available* due to the premature start; it said that everything was more expensive and decaying faster. So I doubt that the alignment is actually providing power; it's simply lowering the usual barriers and making the process vastly more efficient. The power still has to have been gathered from somewhere else.

Anyone's thoughts?

  It is possible to calculate an upper bound, actually.

  A loop lasts no longer than one month. It has a fixed light cone.

  To clarify, if an object is farther away from the looper at the start of the loop than the distance photon covers in the duration of one loop, then the looper and the object cannot interact with each other: they can't travel faster than light, so the loop inevitably resets before they meet. (As example, no entity looping in a nanosecond-long loop will be able to affect anything beyond a sphere of radius 0.3 meter.)

  Unfortunately, I cannot find any particulars about the MoL loop's length. I only know that it lasts 'a month', starts 'after two in the morning'^[ch.41](https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/41/Mother-of-Learning) and ends '2 hours and 40 minutes after midnight'^[ch.40](https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/40/Mother-of-Learning). For lack of better numbers, I'll go with '30 days long'.

  30 days × 24 hours × 60 minutes × 60 seconds = 2.592×10^6 seconds. 2.592×10^6 × 3×10^8 (speed of light) = 7.776×10^14 meters = ~5.198×10^3 astronomical units. In our Solar system, that's past the Kuiper Belt halfway to the Oort Cloud. (Volume of the corresponding sphere is 1.97×10^45 m^3 or 1.4×10^18 Sol, if you care about that.)

  Since the time loop works under extreme time acceleration, nobody in the non-looping universe will be able to notice any discrepancies afterwards, so I cannot think of any reason why the Time Loop Creator would create a template bigger than that.

  Admittedly, that's not a very small template.

  Of course, it all only works under the assumption that FTL signaling is impossible.

  Even if it charges from an external source, it couldn't, as you said, "recharge from the looping world itself," since any energy the loop gained would be energy that it had already expended. It couldn't really recharge, but perhaps it could be made more efficient if it had a mechanism to reclaim energy used to simulate. But I really don't know if it would even be worth it, as most of that energy is used to keep the simulation accurate. 
  Also, come to think of it, we don't know for sure that the loop *doesn't* recycle all the available energy at the end of every iteration.

  We have no info on pocket dimensions mechanics.
  Given that, few thoughts:

   * When creating pocket dimension, it may be possible to specify its content cheaply, but energy/matter transfer between dimensions is costly. In other words, pocket dimension spell is divination heavy. Or defining content may require privileged divine casting. There are rumors of ancient mages, possibly empowered by gods, doing true matter conjuration, after all. No gods - no true matter conjuration.

   * Gate may be located in its own personal pocket dimension with power source unrelated to the host and copy world. In fact it may occupy arbitrary large amount of pocket dimensions.
