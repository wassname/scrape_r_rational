  The story begins [here](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/300693/1/shears/bridges-1).

  Basic info is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3te0fy/rtff_shears_chapter_1_rmlp/cx5d65r).

  Please tell me if the whitespace for this chapter renders oddly on your device. This is the first time FIMFiction's editor has seriously frustrated me. Anyway, thanks for reading!

  In MLP (canon and fanon) proper nouns from Earth are usually "ponyfied" (you know, Canterlot, Manehattan, Haycart, Neighpon, Horschach, etc.). 

  You don't seem to do this. I noticed Maxwell and Markov in this ToC, and Moebius in the previous chapter. Is is intentional or maybe an oversight?
