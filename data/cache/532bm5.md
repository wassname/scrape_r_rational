## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  Well, yesterday was the anniversary of Undertale's release, and damn if that wasn't the most fun I've had in memory. I spent all day listening to a fanalbum that was released in a launch party on streams (97 tracks! 6 hours of songs!) and looking at fanart and reading people's experiences with the game and how it's helped them. I am incredibly happy that it exists, as it is responsible for my indelible optimism. I'm still kind of riding the high of yesterday right now.

    I started playing Undertale a while back and haven't reached the ending yet because I haven't been driven to play it when I could do something else. I'm in a position where I'm not entirely sure if I like it and want to finish, but I feel obligated to because of the effect it's had on so many people. It's had some funny and creative moments, and it even made me feel something a couple times, but I haven't been motivated to get back to it.

    I'm worried this might be the same case I had with Adventure Time or MLP:FiM, where I checked it out because everyone praised it only to find out that people loved the emotional depth it had *in addition* to what it was on the surface. Is Undertale a similar situation where it's really for people who are already into what it first appears to be, but has an extra level to it for fans to enjoy?

      If you're past Undyne and still aren't getting into the game you probably won't. If you're not liking it, don't play. There are lots of popular games that I don't like, and I like many games that are unpopular. Video games are a matter of art and taste and it's reasonable to disagree on it. I played Undertale at a run one Saturday afternoon and found it an enjoyable experience. Narrative continuity is important, so I'd be really surprised if breaking it up over several months is a good idea.

      Don't feel like you have to like something because it's popular.

        It'd be easier if I knew what kind of games I actually like. Every time I play one I have to psychoanalyze myself just to see if I'm actually having fun because it's really difficult to tell. Every other medium of art is easier for me to consume because I'm more certain about how I feel about it, even when I'm apathetic towards it.

          Maybe you should watch LP's of games instead. That way it's a video, which, presumably, you would be more able to discern your enjoyment of.

          Of course, doing it that way you could miss out on some intrinsic joy or immersion derived from actually being the controller of the game. But some games have substantially better story than gameplay anyway. And in an LP you can skip gameplay. So...  I'd say it's a hit and miss tactic. On the other hand you can play LPs at 2* speed. So you can hit and miss faster.

          In undertale's case, there are tons of story events that directly insert themselves into and subvert gameplay expectations, so you definitely lose some of the feeling by watching an LP. *Unless* you manage to vicariously live those experiences through the emotions of the LPer you're watching.

          Actually, I've watched a *lot* of undertale LPs in order to vicariously relive the experiences of the most emotional points of the story.

            You and me both. 

            Yes, this is definitely an option I'd advise over not finishing it altogether, but it's also very much less enjoyable to experience vicariously for your first go at a game like this.

          You might want to consider Bartle's Taxonomy of player types

          Achievers value a sense of progression, achievement, skill and increasing difficulty in games.

          Explorers value a sense of depth and complexity, original ideas and creativity in games.

          Socializers value a sense of community, social interactions and co-operative play in games.

          Killers value a sense of competition, rankings and PVP in games.

      Hmm... I can't say for certain -- I loved it from the word go; hell, I was waiting with baited breath for it to even come out (I'd followed Toby Fox, the creator, since his days making music for Homestuck). 

      However, I will say that there are a lot of people that started it and stopped at some point, and then got back into it again and loved it. 

      There's someone in a community I'm involved in that got to Papyrus and stopped because they thought it was shallow and then eventually someone convinced them to continue and they adored it, one of my closest friends got to Undyne before the game really hit them... I dunno, it may be that way for you, or it may not be. 

      Either way, the game is likely to take at most 8 hours for a pacifist run, and a fair bit less on others.

      As far as your explicit question goes... I adore it for its emotional depth and its message, as far as theming goes. When I first played it, I found the art kind of awkward, but about two hours in I forgot that that was even a complaint I had because I got so absorbed in the story. Its characters all have a great deal of depth, even those that seem at first shallow and narcissistic -- I especially enjoyed how even the random NPCs you'd come across would have their own personality.

      How far along are you, if I might ask?

        The boss fight with the spider woman. I'm in the chapter after Papyrus and Undyne, who did provide the most memorable moments so far. I think the problem isn't that I don't feel what I'm supposed to, I do, I just don't feel something as often as I'd like. The actual gameplay is pretty simple and doesn't really do much for me. It's fine, but I'm not here for turn-based combat and bullet time, I'm here for the story.

        I have a ton of games on my Steam account that I haven't even touched because I keep finding tv shows and books to be more reliable sources of entertainment. Undertale's gameplay doesn't get in the way of the story by any means, I've done several things in the game I feel happy or guilty about, but in the end I still feel like I'm waiting for those moments to happen when I should be having fun just playing the game.
        ```

      It is a very peculiar flavor, yes. It won't *make* you like it, if it doesn't get you pretty quickly, at least from what I've heard from people who don't like it.
      ```

    - u/Fresh_C:
      ```
      I was also kind of luke-warm on it, but I think I liked it slightly more than you seem to. It took me a while to actually beat my first play through (**very mild spoiler** - you have to beat it twice to get the good ending, though you don't have to play through the whole game over again, just have to do some extra steps at your last save.)

      I'll say that this is a game where the ending is the best part because it really wraps everything together and gives some unique twists on the story and even the mechanics of the game.

      So for me at least, it got better and became something truly memorable. But the most interesting aspects of the story are mostly revealed in the end game even if they're hinted at along the way.

      I'd say if you can't force yourself to play the game, it's worth it to maybe watch a let's play with the boring bits cut out, or even just read a plot summary. Though the plot summary won't give you the feeling of atmosphere. There's some novel ideas in the game that are worth some time investment.

  Based on some recommendations from this sub I've been reading some of the best reviewed books from /r/noveltranslations. Overall I'm pretty disappointed. 

  Over the past few weeks I've been reading I Shall Seal the Heavens on and off. It's so damn one dimensional. The only time that the protagonist fails at anything at all is in his backstory, where it's repeatedly mentioned that he's a "failed scholar". Other than that, its smooth sailing for the guy. He's pretty much excellent at *everything.*   He goes from being [spoiler](#s "a complete novice at alchemy to one of 4 grandmasters in history in less than 6 years, in a world where all the other alchemists near that level are hundreds of years old.") It honestly reads like a 10 year old's power fantasy. There is absolutely no argument against him being a complete Mary Sue.

  Pretty much all the stories I've tried from /r/noveltranslations are Mary Sues, actually. It's weird going to that sub and seeing people highly praising something and then you try it and it's mostly terrible, particularly when they also praise something you like (Mother of Learning is pretty popular there). I ended up reading way too much of these stories for how much they suck. 

  /rant

  So yeah, can anyone here recommend a xianxia or the like that doesn't suck?
  ```

  - u/GaBeRockKing:
    ```
    They (almost) all suck. Not because xianxia as a genre is bad, necessarily (although it certainly has its problems), but because different writing conventions across cultures lead to a close interpretation of the text being incredibly stilted by our standards. [I'm a spider, so what](http://blastron01.tumblr.com/post/128092878250/im-a-spider-so-what-001) is the only fan-translated novel I've managed to enjoy (LN, Wuxia, or xiaxia), mainly because the translator takes some liberties, so the text isn't so jarring. (And because the original work is somewhat intended to be a subversion, to the MC doesn't just curbstomp everything.)

    As for the overlap between /r/rational and /r/noveltranslations, I think what happens is that /r/rational pushes munchkinry, which typically leads to (admittedly well justified) wish fulfilment. The LN fans are in it for the wish fulfilment, so they'll enjoy munchkin-heavy rationalfics. But /r/rational posters are in it for the munckinry, and not necessarily the wish-fulfilment, so wish-fulfilment without munchkinry bores us.
    ```

      >>Not being able to use my silk at all is another huge pain. I’m able to use it for things like throwing rocks around, but it’ll always catch fire eventually, even if it just sits on the ground. The biggest problem here is that my body constantly produces silk whenever I move, laying down a thread wherever I go. In here, this thread catches fire. The flames then race up the line like a fuse, straight towards my increasingly hot butt.

      Funny story.

      edit: Reached chapter 100, and the story seemes to be headed the same wrong way of [*The Games We Play.*](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/RyuugisTheGamesWePlay)
      ```

  - u/trekie140:
    ```
    Not a xianxia, but [this XCOM fanfic](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/245417/1/XCOM-The-Unknown-Menace) was translated from Russian and I thought it was pretty good. I never finished it because I dropped it for a while and when I came back I couldn't remember who any of the characters were, but it's still a good war story that rationalizes much of the original XCOM: UFO Defense.

    The characters are pretty archetypal, but the story doesn't pretend they're more complex than they actually are, so that's nice. It's the kind of story that takes straightforward situations and adds enough details to the proceedings to keep it from being boring. Conflicts are simple, yet engaging.

  - u/DR_Hero:

    As an avid reader of eastern web novels and frequenter of /r/noveltranslations, 80% of the stuff on that subreddit sucks.

    I have trouble recommending pretty much anything there to /r/rational fans, but there are quite a few novels I enjoyed reading. Here is a list of novels that are more than pure wish fulfillment in no particular order.


    **Chinese:**

    [Way of Choices](http://www.novelupdates.com/series/ze-tian-ji/) - Political, very poetic, but the translation went through many hands. Quality story.

    [World of Cultivation](http://www.novelupdates.com/series/world-of-cultivation/) - If a random person asked for a CN novel recommendation, I would point them here first. Translation leaves a lot of terms in pinyin so it will take some time getting used to it.

    [A Record of a Mortal’s Journey to Immortality](http://www.novelupdates.com/series/a-record-of-a-mortals-journey-to-immortality/) - The MC isn't a munchkin, but is very shrewd. 

    [Demon’s Diary](http://www.novelupdates.com/series/demons-diary/) - Same author as above. Shrewd MC

    [Transcending the Nine Heavens](http://www.novelupdates.com/series/transcending-the-nine-heavens/) - Reincarnation story. In just the first arc he has to out strategize the guy who successfully took over the continent in his past life. Lots of Humor, a bit of politics.

    [Murdering Heaven Edge](http://www.novelupdates.com/series/murdering-heaven-edge/) - The MC and his friend were unreasonably mature when they were younger. Some powerful demonic cultivator forcibly took the MC as his disciple.

    [Jiang Ye](http://www.novelupdates.com/series/jiang-ye/) - Same author as Way of Choices, political.

    [Legend of the Cultivation God](http://www.novelupdates.com/series/legend-of-the-cultivation-god/) - Very slow. We follow a little kid as he discovers martial arts and makes a name for himself. You get to see everything from the mundane to the little bit less mundane. A relaxing read.

    [Shrouding the Heavens](http://www.novelupdates.com/series/shrouding-the-heavens/) - It turns out Mars is the first stop on a series of teleporters that our Buddhist  and Taoist ancestors used to travel the cosmos. 

    **Korean:**

    [Dungeon Defense](http://www.novelupdates.com/series/dungeon-defense/) - Haven't read it, but trusted individuals recommend it highly.

    [Evolution Theory of the Hunter](http://www.novelupdates.com/series/evolution-theory-of-the-hunter/) - Feels the most like a rational novel. The Main Character uses the tools at his disposal in a smart way. I'm not guaranteeing anything, probably contains a plot hole or two in there. game-like elements.

    [King Shura](http://www.novelupdates.com/series/king-shura/) - Ancient Chinese asthethic. In a martial artist's world where might makes right, the main character has the power of math. Lots of references to Chinese legends.

    **Japanese:**

    [Sevens](http://www.novelupdates.com/series/sevens/) - Disclaimer: I haven't read many Japanese novels. The main character can hear the voices of his ancestors and they give him advice on his journey to save the world from the monstrous endbringer he knows as his baby sister. As par for the course in Japanese novels, the Main character gets a harem, specifically arranged by the girl he likes. There's some nice character growth in there.

  Guess I may as well post weekly updates here, why not. For those just tuning in, my current project is to build a rational pokemon game. The idea is to A: gain experience in building complex, emergent systems, B: fix pokemon, and C: maybe try and codify what it means to have a truly rational game along the way. I have an essay I've doodled on that last point, and I'm going to try and post that before I break ground on the game proper. Let me know if you have insight on the matter.

  The current task is to finish building a tool that will allow a designer to create and customize pokemon, moves, types, and anything else that might benefit from being easily tweaked. I posted this in the discord server earlier this week:

  http://i.imgur.com/9aHAWv4.gif

  The graph system now totally works as intended. Four different stat growth curves can be selected, and comparison curves from select pokemon are displayed to help the designer get a feel for context. I have one more idea for this that will improve those comparisons, and then this feature should pretty much be done.

  I also added a button that will download a Bulbapedia article (specifically, [this one here](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon_by_base_stats_(Generation_VI-present\))), parse it, and insert the requested pokemon into the tool. This will aid content creation significantly by breaking down the last major obstacle in the way of such a lazy content creator as myself.

  As an aside, I was flabbergasted to discover that Bulbapedia doesn't use Semantic MediaWiki or some equivilent plugin. That page I just linked is created *by hand*. This is astonishing to me; surely such a data-heavy wiki such as this would benefit immensely from being able to dynamically query tables instead of keeping glorified spreadsheets. If I cared less about this project I might have jumped ship and moved to fix that immediately, but alas. Only so many hours in the day.

  Not much time to work this weekend as the in-laws are in town, but I'm going to make a tentative goal to have one more functional gif for next week's thread. Any suggestions or ideas are more then welcome, and if anyone would like to literally beta test my tool, let me know. Windows-only, sorry (doesn't work in wine).
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    Wow, yeah, that is uprising about Bulbapedia. It might be because it's such an old site that it was just considered easier to keep updating it than overhaul the whole thing.

    Also, nice job on the graph system! It looks pretty cool.  I noticed that everyone's HP seems to be much higher than in the other games, signalling a lot more range in damage, I suppose?  Also, are you planning on distinguishing physical attacks from mental/emotional attacks in any way?
    ```

    - u/ketura:
      ```
      Yeah, the numbers are quite a bit larger. I wanted more room to play with, and so extended the base stat ceiling to 1000 rather than 255, and then the curves I chose compounded this. Also who doesn't like big imaginary damage numbers lol. 

      Currently I have Physical chopped up into Contact and Projectile, and Special chopped into Energy and Mental. I toyed with the idea of splitting the special stats to match (sp atk/sp def and focus/fortitude) but I'm going to try and keep the Canon system unless this turns out to be unbalanced. Pokemon have IVs and affinity with individual moves, so I'll either try and fiddle with those for the energy/mental split, or explore other methods.
      ```

      - u/DaystarEld:

        That sounds good. Should add a lot of complexity, and many levers to pull for balancing and uniqeuness.

          Session 1: The party (Two Kobolds looking for a cure for a supernatural plague sweeping through their town, and two elves) meet in a tavern where the mayor is about to announce a bounty on the thing that is kidnapping the farmers near town.  Being all mages (One Wizard, Two Archivists, and a *Spell Blade*?) they "recruit" four commoners to act as meat shields.  The party goes to a house to investigate, and finds out that whatever did it is most likely undead.

          They don't find where it went so they go to the cave it was last believed to be at to investigate, and encountered a bed mimic disabling the only competent NPC of the lot. They headed back to town strait away to try and get the money, under the suggestion of the only evil character, (Who has yet to falsely claim something is dangerous.) with the corpse of the bed mimic.

          On the way they're attacked by goblins and are forced to run leaving the commoners to die, and not set up with a good mix of combat spells, already having fought that day.

          They get back to town, and the mayor refuses to believe it was the bed mimic even though both Kobolds have diplomacy, and used teamwork with a corpse of a creature know to disappear people.  (Bad luck happens.)  They try and fail to recruit a second set of meat shields, but encounter two obviously evil characters in the tavern while looking for them.

          They then return to the cave without incident, and proceed to loot it.  If it isn't nailed down, they take it.  If it is they mine the floor out from under it then take it anyway.  Having done this the party (Now slightly more paranoid, and more willing to listen to the evil Kobold when she tells them not to do something.) mines a set of stairs when they find the only way deeper into the cave is a rope hanging down a trap door.  Having opened a path they walk down the tunnel with pony (the donkey that pulls the cart they have) right behind them with some supplies.  At the end of the hall is a door.

          Through that door is a large room with support colloms forming a rough hexagon inside with the four walls of the room having (From N-E-S-W) a large ledge about 10' up, a locked door, the door they came in through, and solid wall.  This they found out by the paranoid Kobold and the sword Elf walking around the perimeter of the room.  Once they report back the Wizard, and the Archivist/Wizard (Paranoid Kobold) send their familiars out to search the roof of the cave.  The Wizards familiar (a hawk) indicates that there is something up there (through gestures) on the ceiling in the middle of the room.

          It turns out to be a giant maggot, and the party falls back to the door the came in through (as a choke point) and hits it from two sides once it gets in. (The sword Elf on one side, and the other -unlucky- Elf on the other.)  The sword Elf takes damage, but with two characters with the cleric spell list anything less than death is a flesh wound.  It dies and they fall back to the trap door room to rest and refresh spells.

          The two evil characters wander in in the middle of the night see the entire party alive and well and turn to leave.
          ```

          - u/MindsEyePsi:
            ```
            Session 2: The party is now level 2.

            Having refreshed their spells (and checked to make sure that nothing was missing from the cart) they ventured into the cave to the locked door. I'm not sure how that was solved, as I was listening to the evil kobold mining a chunk of the wall to circumvent the door, and later make a bridge across the illusionary floor that was on this side of the wall.

            Once the bridge was made the party crossed into the alchemy lab of a "mad sorcerer." (or something, they still haven't seen the one behind it.) They noted a tarp covering something roughly humanoid standing like a manikin. After the rest of the room was searched revealing two doors on the far side they all gathered near the tarp.

            The sword Elf pulled off the tarp revealing an incomplete flesh golem. The party stacked up in combat formation and initiated with their strongest attacks. The flesh golem nearly one shot their sword mage. This is their signal to run which they do to the bridge they made. The evil Kobold tosses the sword mage the pickaxe used to make it and tells him to break it under the golem. Once the golem steps onto the bridge the Elf smashes it dropping the golem into the pit covered by the illusionary floor.

            The party takes this opportunity to pelt the golem with ranged attacks. This lasts for a turn before it pulls itself out, being only just tall enough to reach the edge of the pit. This is the signal to run and they do with the Wizard and the True Neutral (TN) Kobold providing covering fire. The sword Elf and the other Kobold reach the room with the trap door and they start preparing rocks to be dropped down the hole from the rubble mined out to make the stairs. This is interupted by the golem raging at its inability to reach it's prey being only about half as fast as they are... It starts to run.

            The Wizard and the TN Kobold sprint up the staircase reaching the room only seconds after the others dropped rocks onto the raging golem through the trap door (A few hundred pounds worth.) critically injuring it. It continues up the stairs where it runs into the entire party stacked and prepared to smash it. It dies on the first attack. (A magical, true struck, blessed, guided attack.  I'm reasonably certain it was a crit.)

        Hm.  I had over looked the "living far apart clause".  But going off the last sentence?  Relatively small group - cliques will form and stay relatively solid due to the static makeup of the society.  Everyone will know everyone else at least a little bit, which means social/reputational warfare will be prominent.  And this static social situation will be virtually all the participants know, and mostly all they imagine ever knowing, which imo mirrors the myopia of teenagers who are shedding/forgetting their childhood, while not truly able to imagine the wider adult world.

        Perhaps someone else can think of a clever consequence of combining all that with "living far apart" (I think it might just emphasize the reputation warring even more), but I think "basically high school" is a plausible outcome for a draconic society.  The golden great wyrm has her clique where they talk trash about those loser *swamp dragons*, the second and third biggest reds spend centuries engaged in minor status posturing over territory, the black dragons in the swamps focus their active ire on the also-outcast greens, while talking trash about the conformist golds  and 'roided moron reds and listening to Depeche Mode, etc.

  Still exercising. ([Evidence](https://twitter.com/DPR_exercise).) Hurt my ankle the very first week of a pre-C25k jogging program, and have had to limit which exercises I do the last few days, but still plugging away with whatever I am up to doing.

  My old external HD went *poof*, but I other copies of all its data still exist, so I'm reasonably satisfied with my new HD as my new backup, though I'm not particularly happy - in fact, I'd even say I've given a faint sigh or two - at the dent in my budget caused by buying it. (My monthly budget for non-essentials and one-shot expenses is roughly $100. My new HD, including physical-replacement warranty and data-recovery insurance, cost about $250. ... Le sigh.)

  I discovered the existence of an internet fetish this week which I had previously been unaware of. That's certainly not something that happens every week.

  Am thinking about tackling my diet next, though not in the typical fashion; I'd have to focus less on the specifics of the meal plan, and more on the mental tricks that would be required to improve the likelihood I'd stick to said meal plan. I'm already using most of my "I need to try to keep my heart from exploding" motivational tricks to stick to the exercise program, and am trying to set things up so that "I'm someone who exercises daily" becomes a part of my core self-identity before my subconscious finishes adapting to those motivational tricks and they cease to be effective. Still unsure of what approaches might work at the same time as settling the exercise program into place, or if I'll have to tackle one thing than the other, or what, but am brainstorming options.

    Tracking calories in and calories out is one of the best things that you can do for your diet. The easiest thing about it is that when you start, you don't even need to make any changes; you're just making a list of what you eat every day and giving it a number, which is something like a five minute per day activity. Once you've gotten into that habit, it's fairly easy to notice which foods are really high in calories and where portion size makes the difference. If you're tracking calories prior to eating or buying those things, it gives you a little pause before that moment of purchase/consumption. I think a lot of people go overboard with diets and set up rules that are difficult to follow, which is part of why I think calorie tracking is a better solution from a "will you actually do this" perspective.

    (I've lost about 16 pounds in the last two months with just making sure that calories in are lower than calories out.)

      Yeah, simply tracking everything you eat, even if you don't actually do anything about it at first, is actually supremely helpful. It's well-known amongst regulatory agencies and corporate productivity schools of thought that to measure something is to optimize it. Simply tracking something (like number of accidents on the job or output) is enough to get people who are involved to optimize for it. If you keep track of total calories in every day, as long as you're honest with yourself, even if you don't have an explicit goal of "reduce calorie intake to something reasonable" it will happen. It did for me, at least.

      Some tricks:

      1. Write it down even if you don't want to. You can lie to anyone you want, but don't lie to yourself about what you eat. View yourself as heroic and pat yourself on the back when you successfully write things down. This is right. this is success.
      2. Psych yourself up for writing what you eat. Imagine yourself as a hero breaking down a door to defeat a bad guy, or something, and that door is "remembering to write down what you eat."
      3. Make writing it down easy for yourself. Have an app, or a diary, or something. One trick I used is that, if I can't write it down, I take a photo. I take photos of what I eat throughout the day and transcribe them into a diary in the evening. 
      4. At the end of each day, actually look at what the total kcal consumption for the day was. You don't have to like, feel guilty about it or anything, but make sure you *know* it. 

      Once you're doing this successfully (say, for 2 weeks) you can take a look at your kcal intake and calculate your kcal output and figure out what you should do. TBH for me even measuring my intake was enough to reduce it, because I started thinking about it.

  What do you want out of a real-world metaverse, knowing the current limitations in VR and which ones are going to be overcome in time (Resolution, FOV, GPU rendering capacity).


  The tech is pretty awesome right now, and I don't think we need to reach "Nerve Gear" levels, but I do think we're still a ways off. In my ideal "Metaverse" there has to be a couple of characteristics to allow it to happen, given real-world limitations (bandwidth and ping). For example, to have a good networked VR experience, you need to be able to send data really fast. 

  Edit: Accidentally posted too early. I'm editing this post with more content.

  **Physical Network:**
  The current internet sucks, and will need some major upgrades to allow even (for US users) cross-state metaverse interaction. 
  For individuals using VR, even 30 ms response time can feel laggy and slow. For multiple people, let's say that 60 ms ping is acceptable for player-to-player interaction. Thus, we need to significantly reduce packet loss in all games and reduce the distance that the signals have to travel. That's for the physical network which would allow the metaverse to be good. Also, data needs to be able to be streamed in large quantities. Let's set a goal of every user having >50mbps AND a constant 60ms ping or lower. 

  **Features of Metaverse:** The biggest current problem of metaverse, is the sheer size of it. I would argue that a primitive form of metaverse is already here, in the form of Minecraft. Users can join infinitely sized worlds and build, craft in it, and seek after food, as though they were in the real world in many ways, but also interact in the virtual world in a much more interesting way.

  Phil Metzger published a new paper, called [Space Development and Space Science Together, an Historic Opportunity](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1609/1609.00737.pdf). He argues that we can do a lot more space science in the next few years if we spend about a third of the money on developing a self-sufficient space based industrial supply chain.

  Which fits neatly as a precursor to the more singularitarian idea of developing self replicating space robots and using that to construct Dyson spheres, maitroyshka brains, etc.

  Here's a [video interview](http://www.bnn.ca/video/mining-in-space-is-completely-realistic~953030) where he summarizes some of his arguments.
