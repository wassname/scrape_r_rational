  Alicorn is very good at writing stories that horrify me (if taken seriously), but don't use *any* horror tropes.

      This one, Muse, some of Radiance, and maybe Explorers are the ones that I was thinking of.  I'm sure that Grownups would qualify for someone else's ideas of what is horrifying.

      I should probably get around to reading the rest of the short stories, and maybe the long ones too.  I know that there's a selection bias at play, but 7/7 good stories so far should be enough to go off of.

        Okay, seriously, what should I be putting on that story to Actually Warn people that "horror" isn't doing?

          I was off guard only because /u/ulyssessword seemed to be classifying Dogs as horror, and since Dogs didn't bother me at all, I assumed Muse wouldn't either.

          Also, I found Muse by looking at the [index page](http://alicorn.elcenia.com/stories/), not the [stories page](http://alicorn.elcenia.com/stories/stories.shtml), and so I didn't realize that you yourself had designated it horror. I see now that you did not classify Dogs the same way (which I think is appropriate).

          Normally I enjoy horror, and [](#s "people gouging their eyes out") doesn't really bother me. But Muse hit me on a very personal level, because I feel [](#s "despair over the ugliness of things") on a regular basis.

          It was a great story, regardless.

  I have some issues with the 'conclusion' that society apparently came too in this story regarding animals.

  Makes too strong a precedent towards some unpleasant behavior regarding humans.
  ```

  - u/Chronophilia:
    ```
    I can see where they're coming from and how the internal logic of it all works. They make a convincing alien society.
    ```

    - u/Nighzmarquls:
      ```
      Oh yeah a convincing one, I have no doubt this could be a functioning and effective society. I just don't see it as one I'd pick over the current one.

      It sets a precedent that can just as easily justify rendering the entire human population as we would understand it today extinct.
      ```

      - u/iemfi:
        ```
        I think the important thing is that they don't kill any animals though, just stop them from reproducing. And since they are unable to object to that I don't see how it's similar to rendering the entire human population today extinct.
        ```

        - u/Nighzmarquls:
          ```
          that only really works because the animals still have built in death clocks. It does indeed change the formula but if we were mapping this kind of 'kindness' the 'civil' thing to do in this scenario is no longer allow access to body upgrades or immortality serums or uploading unless you submit to certain alterations of your mental architecture so that you can be properly 'aware and capable of performing the necessary actions'.

          Letting that particular trend continue with more and more complex and diverse entities of mind means no human ultimately is allowed to exist that even necessarily resembles us because that would be 'too cruel'.
          ```

        And maybe, they would be right to do so.

        I've gone entire hours without hurting before. It wasn't so bad.

        I wouldn't mind being something a bit more robust than human.

    Because Lucky had an anxiety disorder her whole life - she was paranoid and sometimes stupid and she would lash out and bite, and my mother believed in *dominance hierarchies* and that probably just *made it worse* - and I would have given a whole hell of a lot to be able to just *talk* to her and find out how to make her ok.

          Would you have a moral obligation to uplift bacteria if you could? Or insects, spiders, fish, sharks, hyenas, etc.? 

          Dogs are probably moral aliens. If we uplift them, they will either live as second class citizens in a universe not built for their CEV, or we waste entire galaxies, containing quadrillions of human life-years worth of resources, on stupid, wasteful dog projects.
          ```

          - u/ArgentStonecutter:
            ```
            I'd start with uplifting humans.

            I'd want to uplift dogs as part of that process, because I suspect we can _benefit_ from bringing dog sensibilities into our social structures. The wild animals most like us, outside of the primates, are probably wolves, and dogs are are already partway between wolves and humans.

            The end point of the uplift process is going to be a pan-terrestrial species, some of whom are descended from humans, others from dogs, others from otters and dolphins and bonobos and hyenas and who knows... whose lives and inheritance are mediated through silicon (or some descendant computational substrate) as much as carbon, by data as much as DNA. Throwing out those viewpoints the way the society in this story did is self-destructive.
            ```

            - u/philip1201:
              ```
              And then it turns out dogs prefer the glory of the pack over the happiness of the individual or the species in their CEV, and you have to either commit genocide on them, deny them their truest desires for the entire future of their race, or watch them fight and hurt one another for the entire future of both your races.

              Look, if dogs have anything to teach us that we would consider good, it's part of our CEV even if they never existed. We don't need to uplift them to learn from them, they don't even need to have existed for us to learn what we would have learned from them, if we're doing our jobs properly in figuring out the CEV.

              So no, their extinction of all animal life on Earth is no more self-destructive than not reading Arabic scholars' works on physics. If you're actually trying to succeed, you can easily surpass their efforts by directing your attention elsewhere.

                That is an unlikely outcome. Hell, you can't find that consistent a goal set even among humans. Are you suggesting that we should work towards that kind of uniformity? That's kind of creepy, to be honest.

                Also, that kind of reasoning leads to conclusions like "we have to eliminate all alien life forms just in case they value our destruction".

                Not to mention killing AI researchers, just in case.

                > Look, if dogs have anything to teach us that we would consider good, it's part of our CEV even if they never existed.

                You've completely lost me here.

                  >You've completely lost me here.

                  I'm confused how I can lose you there, of all places. It's pretty much [the definition of CEV](http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Coherent_Extrapolated_Volition). If there is something good we could have learned along the way, it's part of our CEV. Note the "could have": if you actually need to have the things around in order to learn from them, you can't calculate the CEV because there's good advice which doesn't happen to be personified on Earth. If [] have admirable traits which we should want to include in the future, we should include those traits in the future regardless of whether [] is a species which actually exists.

                  >That is an unlikely outcome.

                  It's an example. Are you trying to be difficult?

                  > Hell, you can't find that consistent a goal set even among humans.

                  CEV. Show a fascist that the best world is one without nations everywhere (assuming this is indeed the case), and I would expect them to acquiesce.

                  > Are you suggesting that we should work towards that kind of uniformity?

                  Overeager reductionism. Just because all atoms are part of one computer, doesn't mean that all atoms are identical, in spite of having the property "part of computer". Human preferences not being uniform or otherwise heavily externally optimised appears to be part of the CEV. 

                  But sure, let's run with that, suppose dogs wanted everyone to be morally uniform. Wouldn't that be horrible to make part of the Terran future? Shouldn't we just ignore them and let everyone be free? Wouldn't that dissatisfy the dogs, because those damn humans are wasting their resources on individuality and a tolerance for moral error? Wouldn't we be sad that the dogs were dissatisfied, given our capacity for empathy? Wouldn't this be a strictly worse world than one where the dogs (sapient and modified or just modified or neither) are happy, we are happy, and there never was a conflict of interest between sapient creatures because we didn't blindly upload an alien species or force a living creature to change its morality.

            >Dogs are probably moral aliens.

            You're joking, right?  *Wolves* might be somewhat alien to us, even though they actually are social mammals, which is already pretty close on a universal scale.  *Dogs* were bred, trained, and bred again to conform to *our* social expectations of them.

            >If we uplift them, they will either live as second class citizens in a universe not built for their CEV, or we waste entire galaxies, containing quadrillions of human life-years worth of resources, on stupid, wasteful dog projects.

            This view of even morality itself as a fundamentally alienating and oppositional project is a major flaw in CEV.  Dogs easily form part of the social community of humanity and which humanity cares about, so there's basically no cost to integrate them.
            ```

            - u/philip1201:
              ```
              FWIW, I would be more comfortable with baseline dogs, especially if we're assigning massive amounts of resources to each person. They can be engineered not to suffer needlessly, and otherwise optimised, but I don't know if dogs want to be smarter^1 , or even if they did, if the consequences of satisfying that desire (redistribution of resources to honour their wishes, potential moral incapability, etc.) would make the decision a net positive. Meanwhile, a reasonably happy and non-suffering pet seems like a very good use of resources, especially in meatspace where they cost less than a static house.

              Meanwhile, would an uplifted dog be what you want for yourself? Keeping their subservience through the uplifting process makes *me* uncomfortable, but without it would they want to play fetch, learn tricks, shower you with affection, etc.? It seems to me that a large part of the reason of having dogs rather than more/slightly wealthier humans is lost when uplifting them.

              > You're joking ... Of them.

              It's ridiculously unlikely a priori, and while I agree that your arguments constitute evidence, I don't think it's enough. House elves,  shpexish obsession with territory or hierarchy, or other failure modes may still exist.

              > This view of ... flaw in CEV.

              True moral disagreement seems to me to be the most fundamental possible disagreement on distribution of resources. Let go of that, and what basis do we have to do anything the way we like?

              > Dogs easily ... integrate them.

              Probably agreed without uploading (see above), but with uploading I doubt they'll fill their former niche.

              [1] Hard to prove, not my true rejection.

          I don't think any of the real suffering reducers advocate stubbed toe type utilitarianism. Brian Tomasik is one of the prominent suffering reducers and leaning towards negative utilitarianism and he mainly argues that negative utilitarianism is justified in the case of extreme suffering like getting fried to death in [brazen bull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazen_bull). That type of suffering might be so bad that it would be better to not have been born and it would require very large amount of happy experiences to outweigh it.

          >There's at least one threshold of suffering (and maybe more) such that if someone suffers more intensely than that threshold, that suffering is [lexigally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographic_preferences) worse than any amount of suffering less intense than the threshold.

          Yeh, that's the other thing that bugged me about the story. They can remap a human's brain into a parrot, but they can't uplift dogs so they can talk to you.

            I considered a variant on the story where they could manage uplifting, but in the version I published, they actually can't.

            - u/ArgentStonecutter:
              ```
              I think it's better that it's left unmentioned. I don't have to like the puritanical asshats for it to be a good story. I should have said "that's the other thing that bugged me about the _society_". My headcanon is that they could but choose not to for the same reason we still have the war on drugs and the war on science and all the other horse exhaust that simply wouldn't be there if a fraction of the people with decision making ability were even vaguely sane.

            Well, I pretty much thought it would go that way from when the protagonists assumed the dogs were actors. But yeah, title alone may be a bit too far. It could have just as easily been some horror story about uplifted dogs or some such.

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    I don't think that this particular story is encapsulated in the twist. There are some stories that are, ones where the twist is meant to be the entire thrust of it, but this was more a story about cultural norms, pain and suffering in animals, and the question of whether it's ethical to keep pets.
    ```

    - u/darkflagrance:
      ```
      Agreed; the bigger twist is really what society does to people who violate those norms. The sense of horror comes in when the story describes how harshly they punish people we consider normal.
      ```

    - u/Chronophilia:
      ```
      What did you think "the twist" was? It was all but stated that the dogs were real dogs, and that revelation read like it was meant to be the shocking twist. But I was more surprised by the revelation that the "Extinction" was deliberate.
      ```

      - u/ArgentStonecutter:
        ```
        The "dogs are real dogs" and the "there are no real dogs" twists weren't the twist. There's lots of SFnal backgrounds where coming across real dogs would be surprising (Niven's "Svetz" stories, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, some of Asimov's futures) without it being due to a bunch of idiot negative utility freaks with no imagination.
        ```

  - u/gabbalis:
    ```
    Second sentence. And only that long because you need that the default of the setting is [](#s "dogs not existing"). (We already knew from the start with high confidence that it is not precisely our world because it is by Alicorn.)

    I mean it wasn't certain by then but the thing is named 'Dogs', though I suppose I may just be innately biased towards that sort of twist and just happened to be correct in this case.
