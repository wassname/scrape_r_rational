  Due to an unforeseen Master’s degree, I’ve had to take a slight break from writing (for a little over a year), but I’m glad to say that Ascent is now finally finished. There are 7 chapters and a couple of interludes to come till the end and then I’ll be moving onto short stories set in the wider universe. If you need to catch up, the story starts [here](https://ascentuniverse.wordpress.com/2017/09/28/chapter-1-necessity/).

  Chapter 18: **Abyssal**, starts it off; we catch up with Vash and Jan adrift beneath the ocean. In the meantime, [here’s another doodle](https://ascentuniverse.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/a-dyn-and-her-conscience.png) I’ve worked on to tide you over – an illustration of the Dyn governor and her ‘conscience’ from [Chapter 9](https://ascentuniverse.wordpress.com/2017/11/24/chapter-ix-diplomacy/).

  Great to see this is back up! This is starting to remind me of the ending of *Ra* - how it goes from normal-ish human struggles to crazy advanced AI dominating everything
