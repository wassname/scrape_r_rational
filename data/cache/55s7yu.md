  One small note, usually burakumin would tend to live in a dōwa chiku area and go to the same school so bullying is a bit more limited. They do face strong discrimination and even coming from a dowa chiku neighbourhood can make it more difficult to get a job but a lot of the discrimination come from older generations.

  On the other hand, second or third generation koreans (Zainichi) who were born in Japan, only speak Japanese and have no ties to Korea are mercilessly bullied and are also heavily discriminated against.

    Oh dear. The articles that I'd read led me to believe that there was a problem with bullying. 

    I thought that I was overdoing things when I considered getting cultural consultants for each character, but maybe I should have... >.>

      I mean that scenario is still possible just a bit less likely nowadays. It's just not possible to know if someone has burakumin ancestry based on the family name or based on look. So, instead people would find out based on where the people lived (the so call dowa chiku). Background checks were often conducted by companies to determine if someone came from such an area and not hire them. There was a company that used to sell a book listing all of the names and locations of dowa areas and that was used in private investigations. Since then, the Japanese government has forbidden publication of any maps listing those areas, of list of dowa people and of background checks which makes it difficult for someone to know that someone who moved out of those dowa areas has burakumin ancestry.

      And since people usually go to the school near where they live, kids who live in a dowa area would tend to be at a school with a sizeable population from the same area.

      Zainichi are more easily bullied because of their name, it's easy for other kids in the school to know that they are zainichi.  Another group that gets bullied are "haafu" (japanese pronuncation of Half), they are kids with one non-japanese parent. It's getting a bit better in big cities but still a huge problem (and of course, Japan doesn't have any anti-discrimination law).

      Anyway, also wanted to chime in that I really enjoy your work and look forward to each new chapter :)

      For what it's worth, the cultural diversity in your story is (currently) one of the more compelling aspects to me; it's hitting a lot of the same parts that I really like about Animorphs and The Reckoning (seeing events from many distinct perspectives and how they affect those characters differently).

      For the cultures that I'm not familiar with, I probably wouldn't notice smaller inconsistencies, but any and all research that goes into making those more and more accurate is greatly appreciated.

      Keep up the great work!

        Thank you! I was really worried about whether it would go over well to have these side chapters that didn't have obvious connections to the main narrative, but I felt that it was important to cast a wider net and let the reader get a sense of things as they're happening across the world. 

        Also, they're really, really fun to write. Writing pieces of a longer narrative is fun too, but it's something else entirely to write these little nuggets, and I like that I can do both. 

        I am also very happy with the comparison to The Reckoning, since that's one of my favorite stories on this subreddit. >:]

          Honestly, where we're at in the story this far, I assumed the background is still being established, so I don't yet feel like any characters we've been introduced to yet is necessarily a side character (though you'd obviously know better than me), especially since none of them have met or interacted directly yet.

          Regardless of whether they are central to the main plot or not, I agree that showing the perspectives of the wider world as events unfold is valuable, and will continue to be of interest to me.

  Awesome. So awesome.

  Just read it, and liking it for now! Gives me a Heroes (the TV show) vibe, in a good way.

  If I had to critizice something, it would be that I find tenses in the narration to be sometimes inconsinstent.
