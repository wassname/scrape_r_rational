## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  I'm a big fan of footnotes in fiction, mostly because I love parentheticals. Discworld does it for humor, House of Leaves does it to carry on parallel stories, and Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell uses them mostly for bits of world-building with the occasional short story hidden there.

  For the current thing I'm writing, I wanted to frame it as a heavily translated work with footnotes from the translator that give some world-building and/or levity. But unfortunately, Scrivener doesn't allow for proper footnotes (at least in the Windows version), which kind of sinks that plan unless I want to do my writing in a Mac VM *or* I want to use endnotes instead (alternately, I could hack my way around it, but I don't want to increase my workflow, since writing is mostly something that I do for personal pleasure).

  Do you like footnotes in your prose fiction? Or do you just find them distracting and skip over them?
  ```

  - u/SvalbardCaretaker:
    ```
    I do like them a lot. Grew up on a steady diet of Prattchet and translated scifi, where puns were often explained in footnotes. Also a great fan of  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_13%C2%BD_Lives_of_Captain_Bluebear by Walter Moers. It has great humurous footnotes. 

    By all means, feel free to carry on this great literary tradition in your awesome writing.
    ```

  - u/Roxolan:
    ```
    I like them (same three examples came to mind), but only on paper. Jumping up and down on a web page is a pain in the ass. I wish everyone would adopt the *Wait But Why* format.
    ```

    - u/alexanderwales:
      ```
      Yeah, that's definitely my preferred format as well.
      ```

  - u/ToaKraka:
    ```
    If an electronic book has *links* to the endnotes (e.g., in some [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/browse/scores/top) files, though I can't think of any specific examples), the reader will click on the link, then hit the "back" button on his HTML-/EPUB-reading program to return to the text, for a minimum of distraction. Definitely, though, if there are no links to the endnotes (e.g., in *[Look to the West](http://www.alternatehistory.com/discussion/showthread.php?t=157898)*), I typically won't bother to scroll down to the endnote and then back up to the text (let alone keep the book open in two separate windows--one for the text and one for the endnotes).
    ```

    - u/alexanderwales:
      ```
      What I really prefer, at least on the web, are footnotes in the style of [Wait But Why](http://waitbutwhy.com) or [XKCD What If](https://what-if.xkcd.com/) where you click them and then they show the footnote in an unintrusive CSS/jQuery popup. But that's sort of a pain in the ass to do if I'm trying to *also* wanting to keep my text agnostic to the format and compile to epub, mobi, PDF, and for the web.
      ```

        [This](http://www.organizingcreativity.com/2014/05/scrivener-and-paragraphcharacter-styles-in-microsoft-word-with-a-focus-on-footnotes/) link has a workaround, and [this](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/scrivener-for-dummies/9781118312469/a12_17_9781118312469-ch11.html) link covers exporting with footnotes in Scrivener, but requires a ten day free trial to view.
        ```

  - u/thecommexokid:
    ```
    > Do you like footnotes in your prose fiction?

    As a rule, no. I find they break absorption. For me, the best stories get me into that flow-state that truly engaging reading can bring on, where I lose conscious awareness of the fact that I am reading a book. The experience of encountering a little number, having to look down to the bottom of the page and find the footnote, then find my place again in the main text, only serves to make it impossible to forget that I am reading.

    If notes are really necessary, I agree with some other posters that What If/Wait But Why–style notes in an online text are probably preferable to footnotes as usually implemented on paper. At least there's no difficulty with finding one's place again upon finishing the note.
    ```

  - u/Luminnaran:
    ```
    I remember when I first read the Bartimaeus series that the footnotes were actually my favorite part of the whole series. If done right I think footnotes can be both informative and help the read to understand the worldview and beliefs of the protagonist.

  Hey, everyone! I've recently deployed the first version of my startup, [lumiverse](http://lumiverse.io/), it is a platform for publishing and discovering educational videos. I think you will find it interesting. 

  One of the people who added their videos is Julia Galef, she makes a really great [rationalist vlog](http://lumiverse.io/user/JuliaGalef). If you haven't seen it - watch her video on Bayesian thinking, it's very cool(you can also find her videos on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz-RZblnhjXK_krP1jDybeQ)).

  Also, I would really love some feedback about the website, if you can tell me what you think about it - that would be awesome.

    I've got a GearVR. As an avid PC gamer I dearly wish I could get one of the high-end headsets, but I just don't have the money for that right now. 

    It's good enough (and portable enough) to show off to the normies, but there isn't much content for it at the moment. The most useful feature is the ability to watch movies while lying down. 

    I expect things will get better though, because Samsung is heavily pushing it alongside the launch of the Galaxy S7.

  Watched the fourth season of House of Cards. It is much better than the third season, which is good. Still doesn't seem as realistic as the first two seasons, but it was very enjoyable.

  - u/alexanderwales:

    Yeah, I agree, it was much better than the third. I still wish that they would have resolved more than they did. And I agree that it was unrealistic, but for the most part I thought they made it work in service of the story without it bothering me too much.

        Ah. That worked real well for George Lucas! Are you a fan of the concept?

        As an aside, isn't Kanye West a giant joke? Maybe you like his music, but do you respect the man? Admittedly, I only know of him through reddit, and I've never been into that kind of music so I have no incentive to admire him.

        - u/alexanderwales:

          Kanye West *the person* is a joke, and partly a joke of his own design. Kanye West *the musician* is not. His music is some of the best of its genre.

          Eh, I got into rap fairly heavily a couple months ago and Kanye's music is the best in the genre. By a wide margin imo. Rappers reputed for having more technical skill (like the later Eminem, or the now-hot Lamar) are so focused on rhymes and conceits that they're often incoherent, or on speed that they slur, while West's lines have a kind of classical--Dionysian yeah, but classical--elegance. And sonically his music is on a different level. I wish there were more musical development, but I don't think he's ever been exposed to classical stuff. And given that his view is limited to pop and rap, I don't blame him for feeling on top.


          I don't know enough about the guy to say more than that.


          The medium, though. If this were my book or my album, I'd be glad for more power over the audience, but worry that if every project's still open to be added to my life might turn into nothing but maintenance and tinkering with stuff from the past. As a consumer, as in this case, I'd feel mad when an experience I like gets taken away, but on the other hand you're already seeing a proliferation of remixes of Wolves and all the other songs on Pablo; that's the age we're in. In that way and others, removing a protected, static "garden" of art you like and replacing it with a constant stream of changes you might disagree with might motivate you to actively create things, to be imperial with your taste rather than adjusting it to whatever other people release. A nag in me says there's still value in the preservation and pedestalisation of immortal artifacts but I don't know if that's a reliquary urge; maybe art's now cheap enough to produce that it can become ephemeral.


          I think the best solution is just to release multiple versions separately, which is feasible with software in a way it isn't with print. There's no reason you couldn't release 5 or more versions of a single artwork, all with like 30% difference in content. I believe this was what was done with this song on iTunes, though not on Tidal where they're artist-empowering, audience-subjugating egomaniacs.


          Your own thoughts?

  Every day, someone, somewhere gets one of these thirteen *fabulous powers!*

  * With the power of Switch, you can trade bodies with any person within about fifty feet.  They do not need to agree to the trade.  You may live indefinitely by switching to younger, healthier bodies.
  * With the power of Assassin, you can kill people instantaneously and unpreventably from anywhere in the world.  The only limitations are that you must have encountered the victim in person at some point since acquiring the power, ie, familiarity over the internet or television is insufficient, and there's a cooldown of one day, ie, you can't kill someone within twenty four hours of killing someone else.  Death by Assassin power is conspicuous; victims melt like Nazis opening the Ark of the Covenant.
  * With the power of Doorman, you may summon, telekinetically move, and fix in place either of a pair of portals a bit larger than your body; the portals are also automatically fixed in place if you get further than fifty feet from them.  Functionally similar to the portal gun, but the portals are fixed in place relative to their current gravity well, rather than fixed to a surface.  Your pair of portals vanishes with your death.
  * With the power of Entropy, your body is replaced with a floating black sphere a foot in diameter.  You have no mass and disintegrate any matter that enters your volume into component molecules, spread over your surface area.  You retain the senses of sight and hearing, though they too are spread evenly over your surface area, giving you a basically panoramic view of everything.  You may move in any direction up to about sixty miles per hour relative to your current gravity well; this is your only way of influencing the world.  You bounce off of other people with the power of Entropy.  Your power is the only one that may be removed with the power of Switch - barring this, you are immortal.
  * With the power of Messenger, you may subjectively freeze time to psychically communicate with a target (within about fifty feet).   This line of communication is involuntary in the sense that they may not terminate it themselves, but is voluntary in the sense that they have complete control over their response.  You receive one second of Messenger time for every second spent in real time.
  * With the power of Hindsight, you may see and hear things from your current position relative to your gravity well at any point in the past.  Solve crimes, spy on acquaintances, or just watch dinosaurs; it's up to you.
  * With the power of Network, you may copy yourself and function as a hivemind of the resulting separate bodies.  You must put one of your bodies into a hibernation state for a day to copy it; it is vulnerable during this period.  Injuries and other damage are transferred over, so try to keep some healthy bodies to copy from.  Your multitasking ability scales with your number of bodies, to cope.
  * With the power of Convincing, anything you say (or sign) will be believed or obeyed by anyone who understands it.  This ability takes precedence over any previously held beliefs, and beliefs and directives induced by the power of Convincing may only be removed by further use of the power of Convincing.  The power of Convincing only works in person, that is, it doesn't extend to recordings, letters, or phonecalls.  People with the power of Convincing are immune to the power of Convincing.
  * With the power of Fluid, you can teleport anywhere by turning your body into the fluid you're submerged in (ie, air, normally), sending your mind through the fluid at the speed of sound, and remanifesting your body out of the fluid.  You may theoretically stay in your mid-teleported form indefinitely, and are immortal this way, but you may only perceive the world this way (and then only through the senses of sound and touch); to influence the world you must remanifest your physical body.  You may be kept out, or in, with a proper airtight seal.
  * With the power of Timeframe, you may speed yourself up or slow yourself down, relative to everything else.  This causes proportional effects to your mass, for example, if you're moving three times faster than normal, you will be thrice as heavy, and if you're moving a third as fast as normal, you will be a third as heavy.  You get one second of extra time for every second of real time, so you may stably spend your entire life moving twice as fast - or you may save up your extra time for bursts of extreme speed and mass.
  * With the power of Ping, you may telepathically ask targets (within about fifty feet) questions.  You will receive an honest answer to the question, to the best of the target's knowledge.  The target will be unaware of the question or answer, so you may use it to collect information on the target without their being aware that anything has happened.
  * With the power of Knot, you may reset the universe to the moment of your empowerment, erasing everything that's happened since, except from your own memory.  Someone with the power of Knot may only be killed by surprise or by suicide, as they may dispel any threat by resetting.  Unfortunately, the butterfly effect is truly strong, so the further they get from the moment of empowerment, the weaker their power is at making predictions.  Remembering undiscovered secrets and uninvented technologies is likely to pay off, though.
  * With the power of Grab-Bag, you receive two powers.  Theoretically, you may receive more than two, up to all twelve, but this is very unlikely.

  Powers that target people within fifty feet have an implicit secondary power of being able to detect people within fifty feet.

  I'm not going to ask you to pick one; some of them are clearly better than others.  Selection of power isn't voluntary, anyway, they're just dropped on people.  How would you respond to getting each power?  How's the world likely to turn out?  (It depends a lot on the personalities of the first few Knots, I think.)

  I've been binging Worm, can you tell?
  ```

  - u/holomanga:
    ```
    The lifespan of most Knots would comprise them gaining their power, acting out a path-to-victory for a short amount of time, and then getting killed by surprise.

    It'd be pretty fun to watch.
    ```

  - u/TennisMaster2:
    ```
    Unless all Knots can be found and taught to cooperate, the world either won't progress, or will, but only at the snail's pace of how many early-Knots agree to cooperate.
    ```

    - u/gabbalis:
      ```
      Well, only if this occurs in some sort of meta-time. Otherwise ten minutes objectively take ten minutes to pass, no matter how many resets occurred during them. And saying 'time progressed slowly' is meaningless. Only a given knot's subjective experience would say otherwise.

      And if the universe contains true randomness, even a constantly resetting knot is bound to spontaneously die eventually.
      ```

      - u/Aabcehmu112358:
        ```
        Time progressing slowly is, in the case of save-state based time-travel, equivalent to a high density of extremely improbable things happening.
        ```

  - u/itaibn0:
    ```
    The most important aspect to figure out, as it seems to me, is how the Knots behave, in the sense without an accurate assessment of their behavior we cannot make any extrapolation of how the rest of the world will be structured. For instance, if a Convincer compels a Knot to constantly reset, this can freeze the universe for thousands of years or more of subjective time, until some kills them by chance between resets, and this thing is likely to make collateral damage of some sort.
    ```

  - u/Sinity:
    ```
    >With the power of Switch, you can trade bodies with any person within about fifty feet. They do not need to agree to the trade. You may live indefinitely by switching to younger, healthier bodies.


    Well, most obvious usage if this Power is to steal someone's life. I'd go close to someone wealthy, take some fast acting poison, Switch, then likely act as I have amnesia. After some time, find someone young and healthy, write off all 'my' current wealth onto him/her, take the poison, Switch... Then repeat last step every few decades.

    There aren't much more uses of this power. If you don't kill your previous body, then there is very high chance you will be exposed & executed.

    >With the power of Doorman, you may summon, telekinetically move, and fix in place either of a pair of portals a bit larger than your body; the portals are also automatically fixed in place if you get further than fifty feet from them.

    Could be used for time travel, likely.

      There's a pretty big use. Rather than just moving yourself you can move other people to. Swap with person 1 then swap with person 2 and then swap with person 1 again. Your now back in your original body and two other people have switched bodies.
      ```

  - u/Jiro_T:
    ```
    Over half of the powers seem designed so that they are mainly useful for screwing other people (and/or the possessor) over, so things won't go well.

    Also, since every day someone gets a power, eventually there will be two people with Knot.  What happens if Knot reverses time while another person with Knot exists?

  - u/gabbalis:
    ```
    Man. Quite a few of these sound like they come straight out of a bad hentai. I mean Breast Magic? Tentacles? A personal Succubus? Skinship? Monster Girls? These are five things I certainly wouldn't pick. I mean what a waste would that be huh?
    ```

    - u/OutOfNiceUsernames:
      ```
      I’d move them closer to B-grade anime tropes than straight out hentai, TBF. Almost everything you’ve mentioned can be found in one seasonal exploitation anime or another — along with [ordinary students](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrdinaryHighSchoolStudent) wielding weapons twice as large as them, operating building-size robots and whatnot.
      ```

  - u/OutOfNiceUsernames:
    ```
    *Many* of the options are worded in such a way that while they *seem* potentially exploitable (Hammer Space, Yin&Yang, Troll, etc), I’d expect the DM to severely cripple them during an actual game. 

    For instance Giga Sword, Magical Gathering, Flooded Market, Adventure, Celestial Scaffold, Wizard’s Closet *could* yield scientific or magical breakthroughs, but they’d more likely either give non-replicable low-grade effects or none at all (e.g. if you’d wanted to smuggle magical artefacts from the Adventure reality). Same with immortality options: Stave Death may not work even with Inner Fire (you don’t have to be in mood of doing something in order to will yourself do it), Eternity Gem may start deteriorating with time even if good maintenance and care were provided, etc. After these, I’d also cross out Christmas Cane (vague definition of “evil”, mind control, chance for an [*Invention of Lying*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Invention_of_Lying) scenario) and Apocalypse (one man’s utopia is another’s dystopia).

    So I think I’d go with [these four](http://i.imgur.com/NxQ5hao.png) as the default: 

     * *Inner Fire* for character improvement and work productivity to me and allies;
     * *Demon Dice* for orchestrating binding contracts with parties who *seem* to be interested in partnership, as an improvised truth detector, etc;
     * *Storm Seer* for multiscale precognition and as a disaster prevention tool;
     * *Spellbooks* for loli-pseudoimmortality — if changing the body didn’t also significantly alter the mind and personality.

    The fifth one would likely be one of those: 

     * *Fantasy Mirror* to “cosplay” characters of my own creation, making myself perfect disguises; 
     * *Nice Boat* (if it works as a Safe Haven, though probably it wouldn’t);
     * *Troll* as a powerful public opinion manipulation tool — but, again, I’d expect it to be severely nerfed in actual gameplay.

         - Apocalypse because a Utopia is worth it, even if it takes 100 years.

         - Stave Death for immortality and the relatively small utility of preventing death around you.

         - Inner Fire to make Stave Death permanent by negating its downside, and also help other people with their willpower.

         - Flooded Market for "Mundane" things that are actually extremely useful outside of combat, like endless decanters of water or other sources of free energy.

         - Skelly Samaritans for the help they give.  It's not really necessary with Apocalypse, but it's still nice.

        Alternatively, I might choose Kemomimi City and Guardian Deity for the last two.

          Rather than Inner Fire, Asylum is probably the only guaranteed way of negating the downside of Stave Death, and also the one with fewest side effects:

          * Asylum can just remove the part of you that could regret life, and there you go. 
          * With Inner Fire, you can power through stray suicidal thoughts, but I'm not sure you can avoid having them.
          * Tagged could also do the job, but you'd have to keep refreshing the effect every few minutes.

    Ok so I had planned to give my answers to this earlier but somehow forgot. I do think in terms of optimization no-one has really had a near perfect build that's not heavily skewed towards altruism. Before giving my optimal (selfish) build, however I will go over why I think particular choices are good or bad:

    Spell Books: Can be used for immortality, however it's just not as good as youth which doesn't have any drawbacks and can even do limited shapeshifting.

    Storm Seer: Some aspects are pretty useless (comparatively) like property values and natural disasters for the area of the storm, but the personal storms might be useful however in absence of knowledge about how much info you get, I'm going to say it doesn't make sense to take the risk.

    Giga Sword: Well first off laser guns and holograms aren't likely to make the world that much better, robotics advances would probably mean some cool stuff (but it says robotics not AI) but nothing *amazing*. However antigravity could potentially be amazing, however since that's the only really amazing effect I'm going to say this choice isn't worth it.

    Fantasy mirror: Come on, how useful is the ability to disguise yourself anyway?

    Apocalypse: First off it only guarantees you will just barely live to see a utopia so it's clearly altruistically bent. More importantly however you are killing off probably the majority of humanity to ensure a utopia in 100 years, however for it to be worth it you have to assume that human civilization was already going to go to shit anyways, otherwise the things specified (post scarcity, post conflict and no pollution) would probably end up happening in less than a century anyway (without as many deaths presumably).

    Stave Death: First off as pointed out by others inner flame doesn't guarantee you won't *ever* feel regret and thus get killed, however asylum can totally work though. This may keep you from dying (only really better than youth if you end up in lots of dangerous situations), but it doesn't halt aging or fix diseases, so you will likely end up practically crippled yourself and won't be stave off death from old age on your loved one's forever.

    Youth: I'm not sure why this wasn't looked at more, it grants eternal youth and can even allow limited shapeshifting. Since this doesn't need  second power to be effective I would rate this higher than stave death.

    Inner Fire: How useful this is kind of depends on how lazy you are starting out, for me however this should rank pretty high. Being able to get nearly everyone ideologically aligned with yourself super motivated is really, really useful for getting your political goals achieved. You can also use this to basically take out any competition by taking their motivation.

    Troll: Since you can't form any sort of online identity using this to get power would be difficult, however using it to get rich is easy. This can function fairly well as mind control, however for it to work you need to get in contact with the victim using an anonymous account, so there's a lot of difficulty using this on people who don't already frequent online forums.

    Christmas Cane: In addition to the obvious uses, I think one great way of using this is actually for *evil*. Effectively drug someone defined as "evil" with the candy and they become temporarily good, that's stated. However knowing that if they don't get more of the candy they go back to being evil, you can basically get them to do anything you want that isn't super obviously evil, in order to keep receiving the candy. However except for the blackmail aspect this is overall way worse than yin and yang.

    Yin and Yang: Holy shit this is powerful. Someone else said that in practice it might get nerfed, but even just using the abilities that are brought up as examples you can do a lot, and I can think of a few more that are pretty similar to the examples already given. Ok first off by inverting love and hate you can easily get followers who are fanatically loyal. Using this to invert good/evil would also be a great way to get followers. Here are some axis that would probably work: living/dead, dumb/smart (use on people who are vegetative or severely handicapped, to get genius's for your cause), and lazy/motivated (which could be used to render inner fire redundant). There are other potential applications but even staying within what's already used as an example, and what seems pretty similar to that, this is by far most powerful and versatile choice. There fair chance that this power could switch somebody on the young/old axis which would make the youth power redundant, however I'm not betting on that.

    The wish I saved for last is Hierarchy (though upon further reflection I think yin/yang is somewhat better): Effectively hierarchy lets you make the social values of the entire 'flippin world whatever you want, how did people miss that? You have to do it all in one sitting but it doesn't elaborate so you can probably get away with sleeping partway through as long as you keep the (chart? idk how this works) in front of you the whole time. Using this power to create a utopia would be trivially easy. It doesn't say you have to have the one sitting, be right when you choose the wish so you might wait a while. Alternatively you don't have to make your wishes on the spot (presumably), so you could spend months figuring this out, don't worry.

    So if I had to pick 3 as it says in the link I would pick Yin and Yang, Youth, and Hierarchy Frankly I think that's the best choice that can be made with three wishes. However the post said 5 so I will talk about those last 2.

    Ok so it's actually kind of hard to come up with 2 more given how good the 3 initial picks were. Yin-Yang and Hierarchy just make so many other wishes redundant. Ok so doomsday clock seems pretty useful, it means I don't have to worry about a lot of kinds of disasters and unfriendly AI in the future, depending on how the clocks works I might be able to use them to predict whether certain courses of action will likely hasten personal or global doomsday. Celestial scaffold is hard to use, and it is kind of hard to know what you can do with it. However it is probably fair to assume they understand earth languages (otherwise i'm not sure you could do anything useful with this) as a result you can probably get them to follow instructions that you put in morse code and are probably going to figure it out if you use it to send binary.

    I'm fairly sure this represents the best 5 wishes overall, if you are particularly ruthless you might swap out hierarchy for torture. The reason for this is that I assumed the wisher would have a basic level of decency, and would care at least a little about society becoming vastly better (even if only out of self interest), however if they don't then they could use torture to to easily abduct people and make them hate you such that using yin/yang you can turn that into love/fanatical loyalty.

    Actually... on second thought... Breast Magic does grant telekinesis against any human, violate thermodynamics, and let you crush opponents under their own car sized mounds of flesh. I hate to say it, but... it may legitimately be part of the optimal build in this cyoa.

  Anyone know of a possible tool that helps you plan your studies? Like, making a study plan, planning out what to do and when, and so on? What have you used for that in the past?

    I don’t have perfect suggestions, but:

    * a mind mapping tool can help you organise and associate various concepts ([yEd](https://www.yworks.com/products/yed) is a both well-made and free option).
    * a [personal wiki](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PersonalWiki) can help organise your knowledge (especially if it is technical, cheat-sheet friendly stuff). If you end up choosing a server-based option, be sure to learn how backuping and maintenance works lest you suddenly lose all your data after significant amount of time spent building your knowledge base.
    * [a PC time manager](http://alternativeto.net/software/manictime/) can help you figure out how much time are you spending on useless crap without realising it.
    * a [card-learning tool](http://alternativeto.net/software/anki/) can help studying things like words, formulæ, and the like.
     * for languages there’s also [Learning with Texts](http://lwt.sourceforge.net/) — you upload chunks of text (articles, books, etc) to the program and start crossing out words that you already know. Helps keep track of what you’ve learned and which yet-unfamiliar words are wroth learning because you keep meeting them. Negative side is that it keeping the database update can be time-consuming.
    * and things like [Zotero](http://alternativeto.net/software/zotero/) can organise research sources, scientific articles, books, etc.

      Personal wiki sounds like an amazing idea. I might try to dump my brain into one of those, and see if it can serve as a corpus for training AI (I kid, I kid).

  I was thinking of a rational [KonoSuba](http://myanimelist.net/anime/30831/Kono_Subarashii_Sekai_ni_Shukufuku_wo) fanfic. For those that aren't aware of it, its a comedy that parodies common RPG tropes in a fantasy world.

  I enjoyed it due to the main character Kazuma being given low stats on everything and a min-max party which he must manage to perform correctly. He does fail a lot in the anime and is kind of a jerk but uses unconventional strategies and pragmatism to beat the odds.

  Now I was thinking about his flaws and besides selfishness he is also pretty lazy so I thought how about making that his main character flaw. In most rational stories I've read the protagonist is always willing to implement his strategies and work tirelessly until they're achieved.

  While this is a really romantic prospect and gives a certain Renassaisance man vibe, in real life people are hardly that compromised. Even people that were considered "gifted" like Newton or highly compromised with efficiency such as Benjamin Franklin had days where they wouldn't be as effective as they wanted. Or their bodies just wouldn't be able to keep up (Newton reportedly had 3 mental breakdowns through his life, probably product of a lack of sleep).

  Procastination, sick days and the like the adventurer overcoming or even failing to overcome those flaws, I think it would be an interesting aspect and show the more human aspect of rationalists. Has this been attempted before?

  I think I'll have to brush on RPG know how to accomplish it as I'm not much of a gamer. Also I'm still deciding whether to take this on the parody angle or show a serious story about the lazy adventurer trying to optimize his party so he can do the most with the least effort.

  Or maybe a story about Kazuma the merchant. If he discovers that providing technology to a medieval world and arranging peace between the "evil" armies and the gods are a more optimal solution, it could turn into a diplomat's story with plenty of politics. Not to mention that those villains don't look that evil in the anime so perhaps showing their softer side would work too.

  Thoughts or suggestions on the matter?

  EDIT: due to further thoughts.

    I like KonoSuba, it's probably one of the better comedy animes I've seen. All of those ideas sound good, but I think that whatever idea you go with you should keep the comedy even if it's more serious than the anime. That's what got people into the fandom and what they'll look for when they read fic of it. Not that you need to have a similar style to canon, but it can help make your story more popular.
    ```

    - u/Faust91x:
      ```
      I see, thanks a lot for the suggestions! Started thinking about maybe exploring different types of societies and economic systems if taking the diplomat angle.

      Also, has there ever been a rational story with a lazy or procastinator protagonist as his main flaw?
      ```

      - u/Timewinders:
        ```
        I'm curious to see how Kazuma would function as a diplomat considering his antisocial nature, but I imagine it would be entertaining to see.

        I can't recall any rational stories with lazy protagonists, for some reason. The usual rational protagonist tends to be strangely driven, even account for the fact that they have more motivation to work hard than people usually do in real life.
