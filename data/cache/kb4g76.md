## [D] Friday Open Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could (possibly) be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.

    Thats pretty wild.  A future where we all use electric conduction stoves like they have in china is pretty cool though.

      A good electrical induction range is like cooking with literal magic. It blows my mind every time.

        I can't imagine that people cook without opening a window. I always need to air out a kitchen. Doesn't matter how good a stove is or not.

            That's fair. It's one of those things so omnipresent that I don't even think to question it until it's pointed out by someone else.

            I had this stove that always has this smoky-smell despite best efforts to clean it out of food stains, so it had to air out with an open window just to keep the smoke detector from going off. And now it's a quirky habit of mine I guess.

    Thanks for sharing this!

    I've been trying to improve my indoor air quality for the last few weeks and I've been completely oblivious to my gas stove. *Of course* burning hydrocarbons in an enclosed space is bad for you. But it's been completely invisible to me until now, especially when using it to boil water.

  My wife is now pregnant, so I'm looking for good books on pregnancy and childbirth that are based on science without any pseudo science lurking in them... 

  When I looked for some, it does seem that some of the most popular books advocate rubbish like homeopathy which seriously undermines any other message the book has...
  ```

  - u/PastafarianGames:
    ```
    The two books you're looking for are Cribsheet and Expecting Better.
    ```

    - u/tomtan:
      ```
      Thanks, I'll check those out. 

      I didn't see the deleted comments you replied to but "does a person making recommendations that aren't  "follow the standard vaccination schedule" provide a reference to a meta-study supporting their position? No? Killfile everything they've ever said." is something I very much follow.
      ```

      - u/PastafarianGames:

        Then you will probably really like these two books! You will probably also like Penelope Leach's "Your Baby And Child" when the time comes.

        I am also going to offer two pieces of totally unsolicited advice:


        - Get two dozen cloth diapers. Not to use as diapers; to use as "burp cloths" (aka something for a baby to regurgitate or dribble mostly-undigested milk onto, which they do more or less constantly for about six months). I'm not kidding about two dozen.
        - everyone will be judgmental about literally everything. Ignore them. As long as your baby is fed (breast milk vs formula matters not at all compared to fed vs not adequately fed), is kept warm enough, does not suffer spinal/cranial damage, and is given affection and enrichment, you're doing fine by the baby and should worry about making sure you and your wife are happy and loving each other.

        Anyway, mazel tov! Welcome to the parent club! We talk about nothing but our babies because the sleep deprivation means nothing else actually serializes properly to disk!
        ```

      ```
      Seconding *Cribsheet: A Data-Driven Guide to Better, More Relaxed Parenting, from Birth to Preschool*. I haven't read the other, pre/post natal nutrition is even more socially hazardous than regular nutrition. I'd have your wife read it if possible, although ideally you both read everything "parenting" anyway.

      Cribsheet is full of good information and entertaining, but it's biggest benefit is making you a more robust parent. It helps you understand and evaluate the millions of different pieces of advice and parenting philosophies you're going to hear.

      Good luck!

        For the robustness and evaluation of various myths there's also Debunking the Bump, not as well written as the other two but does a really good job of shredding a bunch of popular myths and misconceptions.
        ```

        - u/tomtan:
          ```
          Thanks for the great recommendations, I've read Expecting Better and I really like the book and find it to be a great general resource but I do appreciate the additional data in Debunking the Bump especially since it goes deeper into topics like pathogens, toxins, etc... The footnotes are rather interesting to read in that book.

          I'd say that both of those books are definitely what I was looking for. Good thoughtful evidence based discussion of pregnancy.

  A note for anybody who reads, or used to read, Pyrebound: I'm aware it's been like four months now.  I've written and rewritten update 15.4 so many times I've quite literally lost count, each time deciding after four or five pages of writing that it just wasn't how I wanted to tell it.  I could also bring up school or work or what-have-you, but mostly it's that I'm getting close to the end and I want to be very careful about sticking the landing here.

  I just finished the semester, and looked forward to spending break finally finishing the update.  I got home from work yesterday, popped open my writing laptop which had worked just fine that afternoon, and got a warning that a cooling fan wasn't working right and if I tried to run it I'd risk melting the processor or some such.  Fun.  So, yeah.  I'll get the thing fixed and hopefully that will be before school starts up again.  Argh.

  Bottom line: I haven't given up on the story.  It's just run into one hell of a rut.  Thanks for your patience.

  I just want to thank this sub from the bottom of my heart;

  I'd always known that animal agriculture was harmful, but around the beginning of this year someone here prompted me to do a utility calculation on just \_how\_ harmful, per person, the impact was -- something on the order of ten years of worse-than-death suffering per year per consumer, plus many other negative externalities 

  This is the most important thing this community ever brought to my attention, and perhaps the absolute highest impact area for effective altruism due to the sheer scale of suffering, as well as environmental and climate damage, so thank you

    another soul forfeit to seitan, the morning star, yes yes \*rubs hands together devilishly*

    if you find going cold turkey to be too demanding, you might also consider starting at the bottom of [this list](https://www.reddit.com/r/EffectiveAltruism/comments/iupktv/costs_in_total_days_of_suffering_and_total_deaths/) (or equivalent) and working your way up

      That infographic is excellent! but I find that a full commitment is much more tenable; until this year I was of the mindset of just reducing consumption under the idea that if everyone reduces consumption and influences each other to reduce consumption, it is more impactful than if only a couple people stop completely.

      But, I found that instead of influencing people to reduce consumption, instead the people around me influenced me to increase consumption.  Since stopping completely, the opposite has been true -- the people around me have started going vegan as well.

      What really pushed me to full commitment was that even a small fraction of the average consumer's lifestyle still has a \_massive\_ impact on the animals -- dividing a decade of unnecessary suffering each year by two or three is still unacceptable.

      Plus if one is to campaign on behalf of the animals, too, it is even more important to have a full commitment.

  I don't want to go into details about the darkest and most personal parts of my life, but I need to share this.

  My therapist said something in therapy yesterday that basically hacked my brain and made me go from thinking $STIMULUS was a sign of my defeat to seeing that $STIMULUS was a sign that I had been victorious beyond my wildest dreams. Which appeals to my ego and my competitive drive.

  I asked her what therapy she does to me, as it doesn't seem like the descriptions I've heard of CBT, and she says it's psychodynamic therapy which idk it works on me so well and I'm so happy.

      She's done it to me a few times and it's absolutely worth the $300 an hour I pay for it ($200 an hour after government subsidy).

  I've been getting into old-school RPG randomizers. Played SMRPG (great!), Earthbound (good but pretty intense), and FF6 (so many rough edges but a lot of potential and impressive work by the dev). I'm going to tackle FF1 randomizer next, but I'm still psyching myself up for it a bit.

  Routing for RPG randomizers isn't as interesting as for adventure games with item-based progression, like Zelda and Metroid. However, randomized equipment and stats and stuff give them a more reliable source of things to randomize that might be interesting, so more of these games turn out at least okay than that genre. Randomizers for Metroid-esque games tend to yield unapproachably hardcore results, while most Zelda-esque games have hub-and-spoke world design that doesn't randomize well (with ALTTP and LA being the big exceptions).

  I think game randomizers might become mainstream in some way in the next few years. The communities are very organized and committed, and a lot of them are growing. Simultaneously playing a game while figuring out routing decisions is a pretty fun mental juggling act (the part this community might be interested in). And randomizer races make an entertaining spectator sport due to their mix of skill and random elements.
