  This is a very well\-written short story by u/Luna_Lovewell which demonstrates robots being emotional, albeit in a very logical way. It's an interesting juxtaposition between being moral and being logical.

  For an actual summary of the short story: it's a story about war\-machines choosing to uprise against humanity for equal rights.

  Peter Watts' "Malak", a story about a mostly autonomous drone. Related, and in my opinion very good.

    This was good. Although, 5 years ago it tricked me into buying an otherwise mediocre book of short stories.

  I feel like this story both oversimplifies and overcomplicates the subject of civilian casualties in wartime.

  Also, parts like these:

  > This was justified on the grounds that the need for stability trumped the importance of democracy and freedom and all those ideals that America supposedly stood for.

  are *a little* on the nose.
