## Are there any well done The Gamer stories?

### Post:

I'd love a list of stories where someone has powers like the protagonist of the Manwhua The Gamer/RPG style gaming. I feel like I've read so many potentially good stories that just kind of fall flat. Whether that be from a writing failure, a tendency towards power creep, ect. 

It doesn't necessarily have to be rational/rationalist, I'd have asked elsewhere but I feel like the people on this sub have higher standards for fiction.

Also, I am currently reading Worth the Candle and The Daily Grind so recommendations outside of those two would be nice.

  I'm going to recommend [Erfworld](https://archives.erfworld.com/Book%201/1). It's the story of a gamer who suddenly finds himself in a strange, cartoon-y world and is forced to quickly learn the rules in order to survive.
  ```

  - u/FunkyFunker:
    ```
    I would recommend [The Last Turn](https://www.erfworld.com/blog/view/50734/the-last-turn-part-1), an Erfworld fanfic by the writer of The Wandering Inn. It's a game world, not a single-person power, but it might be what you're looking for. It's short (for the genre) and I enjoyed it much more than Erfworld itself. Munchkinnery at its finest.
    ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    How is Erfworld? I remember loving the first book, but didn't really keep up with it after that. Worth a binge? Worth reading every update as they come out?
    ```

    - u/redrach:
      ```
      I tend to binge it every few months myself. I think it's quite excellent, especially how the characters have been developing. 

      They've also released a prequel book (each chapter is a block of text with a single illustration each) that really goes into detail about a lot of the character's pasts (particularly Wanda and Jillian).
      ```

    - u/CouteauBleu:
      ```
      It's still pretty good and consistent, but the pace goes waaay down.

      By now it's the kind of pace where the story has an entire book (twice as long as Book 1 so far) dedicated to the "multiple characters are stranded from their base and their faction is in mortal peril as long as they are" arc.

      It's enjoyable to read, mind you, (I'm still reading) but the pace has really taken a hit. The fact that half of the updates are text pages going into the details of each character's backstory and how it informs their decisions doesn't help.

      ("eg Did I ever tell you about that game I played 10 years ago when I was in a completely different faction? Here's how that game works. The situation I'm in has some stark similarities with that game.")
      ```

    - u/SvalbardCaretaker:
      ```
      Been following Erfworld since Day 1. Currently _not_ worth the updates, pace too slow, story too complex to get after a week of waiting, lots of text updates that are not suited well to pacing. Much better to binge.
      ```

- u/cabforpitt:
  ```
  Harry Potter and the Natural 20 is sort of the inverse, with a game character dropped into the real (well, harry potter real) world. It's very funny, especially if you know anything about 3.5 D&D.
  ```

  Here are some I've been reading:

  * [Greg Veder vs The World](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/greg-veder-vs-the-world-worm-x-the-gamer.44380/) Good character development, classic take on The Gamer in the Worm universe.
  * [Shinobi: The RPG](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/shinobi-the-rpg-act-1-naruto-si.36903/) Uses the Fallout stats system which apparently you can't upgrade until late in the game. MC screws himself over by treating charisma as a dump stat, then realizes to his horror that he has to interact with actual people this way.
  * [The Wandering Inn](https://wanderinginn.com/) There's no explicit XP numbers in this story (that we're told about), rather the levelups and associated skill gains seem to be in some way connected to character growth. Fantastic writing style.
  * [Dungeon Heart](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/10881/dungeon-heart) Almost no character growth, but there's an in-story reason: The protagonist is a very old dwarf with a well defined and stubborn personality.
  ```

  - u/Green0Photon:
    ```
    I actually really liked Shinobi The RPG. It was kind of shit until he got his team, but then it got a lot better. It is a pretty weird twist on The Gamer, which was amazing, but it disguises itself as being a shitty cliche story first. The ending of Act 1 was amazing, and I actually cried at the climax just before hand, which happens very very rarely. I definitely recommend this it.

    I haven't read the others.
    ```

  - u/kaukamieli:
    ```
    Thanks! I read through Shinobi and I'm reading Greg now. I'm actually liking Greg a lot.

    edit: Greg was pretty great actually, for the most parts.

    Opened up the Dungeon Heart and saw word "cultivation". Oh boy...
    ```

- u/edwardkmett:
  ```
  The Erogamer on QQ is probably the best story in that genre that I've read.

  Something that borrows some of the elements is [Threadbare](https://www.amazon.com/Threadbare-Stuff-Nonsense-Andrew-Seiple-ebook/dp/B078KGS4V4), by Andrew Seiple, which was first posted as a web serial on SV. Not exactly rationalist, but still a fun read.
  ```

  - u/SkyTroupe:
    ```
    What is it about? The Erogamer sounds a bit too explicitly lewd for my tastes
    ```

    - u/edwardkmett:
      ```
      It is what it says its about. Protagonist finds herself with erogamer stats. I only started reading it because I found it linked here, but I feel like the time was well spent. It may not float your boat, but it does have at least one explicitly rationalist background character and a bunch of characters intelligently dealing with the fact that they've found themselves thrust into an eroge as support characters.

      Threadbare is basically all sorts of cuddly awesome though.
      ```

    - u/CopperZirconium:
      ```
      Threadbare follows a little teddy bear golem as he grows in power and helps topple the antagonistic demon-guided kingdom. The world has recently been transformed from a classical fantasy world into a quirky fantasy RPG, and the inhabitants have had to figure out the new mechanics on their own.
      ```

      - u/Sonderjye:
        ```
        Threadbare seemed to me like a typical litrpg, with the usual utter lack of character growth. I enjoy the rise to power story but this was a mediocre example.
        ```

        - u/CopperZirconium:
          ```
          I agree. It was fun and easy to read, but characters hardly changed except for getting more power. Conflicts were resolved mostly by one side overpowering the other, or upon discovering a misunderstanding. I can't think of one instance where any main character actually changed their minds, let alone their values. 

          It's appeal is its quirky setting and fun situations. For example, the first dungeon Threadbear enters is cat and death themed with the "Nekomancer" as the final boss.
          ```

          - u/None:
            ```
            What was annoying to me was that it's answer to the grim and practical anti-villains is that you can totally have morally good means *and* ends, the anti-villains just gave up on being good too soon.

        - u/xachariah:

      Their executive director, Nate Soares, came out to Boston last September and made a very  compelling case. I was able to wrap things up with Digital Asset at the start of August and we made it happen. He can be quite persuasive.

      I just spent much of ICFP introducing his people to my people as it were.
      ```

- u/Hidden-50:
  ```
  I'd recommend [Fairy Dance of Death](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8679666/1/Fairy-Dance-of-Death). It sets the death game of Sword art online in the more pvp centric world of Alfheim Online, where players are less incentivized to work together, and adds a layer of politics.

  It's currently unfinished. I think the author is struggling to find time, but their recent profile update says they're still working on it.

      Did you like the abridged version? Because that was fantastic and I couldn't stand the source.
      ```

      - u/SkyTroupe:
        ```
        SAO Abridged gave incredible depth and genuine moments in which I could empathize with the protagonist. I just have a knee jerk reaction to SAO but I will definitely put this on my to read list if you feel so strongly about it.
        ```

- u/GeeJo:
  ```
  I'll second the recommendation for **[The Erogamer](https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/the-erogamer-original.5465/)**.

  If you're familiar with Worm, **[A Bad Name](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-bad-name-worm-oc-the-gamer.500626)** and **[The Paragamer](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-paragamer-worm-the-gamer-w-ocs.496126/)** are enjoyable enough crosses; the first more than the second.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Seconding A Bad Name, the character development in this is better than most Worm fanfics I've read so far.  
    The protagonist doesn't start out as a very smart person, but he makes decisions that make logical sense given his experiences and the situations he finds himself in. And as the story goes, he does gain a lot of agency and makes more intelligent decisions.

    Have to warn though, full spoilers for Worm.
    ```

  - u/CopperZirconium:
    ```
    Thanks! I just read A Bad Name because of this recommendation. It's pretty good! I hope it continues.
    ```

  - u/SkyTroupe:
    ```
    I love Worm and its many fanfictions so I will definitely hop on those two right away!
    ```

- u/Kuratius:
  ```
  The Snake Report and Ryuugis The Games We Play. TGWP gets a bit dull towards the end though.
  ```

  - u/SimonSim211:
    ```
    Totally agree, https://old.reddit.com/r/TheSnakeReport/ is epic, though less logic driven more fear driven in a fun way
    ```

    - u/edwardkmett:
      ```
      The first book of The Snake Report is excellent. The quality took a sharp drop with the start of the second, though.
      ```

      - u/SeekingImmortality:
        ```
        It is at least climbing solidly back in the direction of the first, with the later portion of the second book.
        ```

        - u/edwardkmett:
          ```
          After your comment, I went back and finished it. It does get better. I understand now a bit why the author was trying to change things, but the jump felt abrupt and under-explained.
          ```

  - u/vallar57:
    ```
    I cannot recommend TGWP. The protagonist's, erm, macro decisions are irrational at best and just plain stupid at worst. The fact that they end well does not absolve him, it's merely plot armor.
    ```

    - u/causalchain:
      ```
      My take on it: Jaune does a lot of thinking, and it does help him (it at least looks like a rational fic), but he's not spending that thinking time effectively so it seems more rambly than rational. Jaune has a lot of abilities which he can choose between but he makes his decision by thinking about it instead of taking measurements and making calculations. Eg. he chooses to split his stat points between intelligence and wisdom but:

      \- Stat points can be increased by training them, so he is encouraged to put his points into already high-level stats to maximise their payoff (ie. focus on one stat)

      \- Intelligence and Wisdom stats work together very well, but in the late game, each 50-stat step gains even more benefits to the last. So while 250-250 was very powerful, 0-500 would have been absurd.

      It's like the rational equivalent of a chinese xianxia: a large quantity of (relatively) cheap writing that is enough to tickle all my requirements.
      ```

      - u/vallar57:
        ```
        One day, I *will* write an actual rational xianxia fic :)
        ```

    - u/rumblestiltsken:
      ```
      Saying Jaune has plot armour is like saying Cat has plot armour. Yeah, it is true, but it is literally a foundational rule of the world.

      His decisions make sense given who he is, they achieve his goals given his values.
      ```

        Which team to join, which quests to follow and which not to, when use violence and when not - that sort of thing.
        ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      I disagree. Jaune makes the best decisions he can given the information available to him at the time. The fact that his decisions aren't perfectly rational or intelligent doesn't make the story bad.

  I’m a spider so what? Is one of my favorites but there aren’t great translations and it turns into a different genre mostly towards the later parts and got unfun for me.

  I’m currently reading Everybody Loves Large Chests and it’s been really fun and funny although not terrible rational. It is also quite pornographic intermittently which might turn some people away.
  ```

  - u/dinoseen:
    ```
    Yup. I was loving Large Chests, and then it turned into vore every chapter. Haven't read it since.
    ```

    - u/Dragonheart91:
      ```
      Hmm, not sure when that happens. Main character is a man eating monster throughout. One main character does talk about wanting to be eaten by the main character a lot but it doesn’t happen in detail “on screen” very often. I hear the amazon books version toned down the sex so maybe that would be more to your liking?
      ```

      - u/dinoseen:
        ```
        The bit where the succubus character is getting painfully eaten alive and getting off to it all the time.
        ```

        - u/Dragonheart91:
          ```
          Oh yeah. It is never that graphic again but that continues to happen for literally the rest of the story.
          ```

            ```
            Thank you for providing me satisfaction in my decision.

            - u/Dragonheart91:
              ```
              Yeah no problem. Also just as a minor clarification, her fetish isn’t vore but rather masochism. She doesn’t always get eaten and is often tortured in other painful ways instead. Not that it is any better.
              ```

              - u/None:
                ```
                I can't tell if this is kink shaming or just the usual modern "eww, secks" American values leaking through.

                I mean, the whole premise is already absurd. A succubus (magic sex-based demon) that undergoes a weird mind break and develops a masochism fetish as a coping mechanism for dealing with the pain of being a contracted demon to a retarded and voracious omnivorous chest that spends hours summoning her only to eat her alive (because it's too stupid to understand that it can't get full from dissolving mana bodies, and it won't gain mana from eating its own conjured critters) isn't nearly the strangest thing that happens in the story.
                ```

      For kumo https://www.novelupdates.com/series/kumo-desu-ga-nani-ka/?pg=2
      Start with the blastron translations and then switch over when they stop. Sorry it is not more straight forward but there were a number of different translations of various qualities who worked on this one.



      For ELLC there is the e-book here https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B076NSQ6JT/ref=series_dp_rw_ca_1 which is a more polished version of the content with a few new additions and less nsfw content but you have to pay for it or here https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/8894/everybody-loves-large-chests which is less polished but free. Only somewhere between 1/10 to 1/5 has been published though so you will have to switch over anyway if you want to keep reading.

  Dungeon Defense is solid and has has a fairly clever protagonist. The description, copied directly from the series' wiki, is:

  >After renouncing his inheritance of his late father, a young man decides to spend the remaining years of his life without working. One day, he received an email from the company that created『Dungeon Attack』, a standard dungeon-capturing RPG that was boasted as the absolute hardest strategy game. After answering a suspicious survey for the next expansion, he now finds himself in the game as the weakest Demon Lord,「Dantalian」.  
  >  
  >With only his eloquent tongue and memories of conquest as the hero of the game, in order to survive as Dantalian, he decides to tear this new world apart.

  Dantalian is normally defeated in the tutorial mission in the game he finds himself transported into, so he needs to use his intelligence to succeed instead. It's not the greatest story ever written, but in my opinion it's written well-enough and is thoroughly enjoyable. 

  Last I heard, the writer was going through the process of writing the isekai elements out of the series, because in general it functions better as a fantasy story than as an isekai.

    I read this after your recommendation and stopped in Volume 3. I didn't like it. We as the readers aren't let in on what is happening or why most of the time and then the problems get solved because "Oh yeah, the main character knew this thing from the game so it all works out." I would be down with the main character abusing known game info basically be prophetic but the readers are never let in on it until the exact moment when it becomes relevant and makes the main character win out of nowhere. That makes it seem like deus ex machina and not good planning. Also the main character is a pretty insufferable Gary Stu. "I'll just start reciting the complete works of William Shakespear (Which of course I have memorized) at this random bar and now everyone is in love with me because they have never heard a good story before."

    The other big reason I stopped reading was because the main character just casually threw away one of his core convictions in Volume 3. It makes no sense for his personality to take such a huge turn.
    ```

- u/Teulisch:
  ```
  i would recommend [the wandering inn](https://wanderinginn.com/2016/07/27/1-00/) which has levels and classes and skills, but does switch characters over so often. premise is humans sumoned to another world. overall its good, but some of the shifts to other viewpoints feel lacking because of how many there are now. 

  i would not call it rational. it does have regular updates.
  ```

  - u/Laborbuch:
    ```
    Its also ridiculously long. As in, 2–3 >8k word updates / week, >2 million words long.

    But at the same time the author structured the narrative into books (currently on book 5, with book 1 being [available on kindle](http://getbook.at/wanderinginn)) and did a decent job in generally formulating narrative arcs in such a way that they end (or find some measure of close) towards the end of a book.

    That said, it’s not rational or rationalist by any means, but it has some good world-building.

  Worth The Candle is AMAZING, quite long already and still being written. It's about a Dungeons and Dragons DM who finds himself transported into a world that's a conglomerate of all the worlds he created for his campaigns, and he has a game layer that lets him spend points on skills and attributes and level up by gaining experience, in addition to giving him quests.  


  Here's where it starts:

      I could classify Mother of Learning somewhat of a gamerfic. It's not as blatant as most as it has no floating screens, as it's obviously not a game, but the grinding character growth and somewhat numbered power levels are there, as we know stuff like how many magic missiles people can cast.
      ```

      - u/Jokey665:
        ```
        It also has terrible writing, at least in my opinion. I don't think I've ever seen anybody else mention it, though, somehow.

          MoL? I don't think so. Wanna explain what you mean?

          Or do you mean gamerfics in general? There I would definitely agree.
          ```

          - u/Jokey665:
            ```
            I mean MoL specifically. I think I mostly managed to ignore it when I binged the first 70 or something chapters, but ever since it's been annoying me more and more so I ended up dropping it a few chapters ago. It's hard to point out specifically what's wrong with it, I guess, but the one criticism that sticks in my mind is that nobody feels like they have a unique "voice". Take any line of dialogue and, unless it's dealing with information or something that only specific characters know or a similar situation, it sounds like virtually any character could have said it.
            ```

        - u/alexanderwales:
          ```
          It gets mentioned from time to time, and there was some discussion in either the last chapter update or the update before it. The author is (IIRC) Croatian, which I'm sure it part of it. It's just not a thing that people are going to point out every chapter, and if they like it, then it's probably either a bullet they bit, or something that doesn't bother them.
          ```

        - u/tjhance:
          ```
          I don't think it's *that* bad. There are definitely a couple of systemic issues (he overuses ellipses I think, and maybe exclamation points as well) but I also think it has some funny, well-crafted sentences.
          ```
