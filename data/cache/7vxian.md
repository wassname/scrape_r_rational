  My apologies for how long this took, but in my defense it's 20,000 words across three chapters. I don't plan on doing that again in the future, mostly because the rereading and editing takes so long that I basically skip a day of actual writing (and this is still like 1/4th the length of a novel, so will probably have loads of errors).

    1. Free awesome writing = please never apologize. Tho on the other hand, it’s nice to know you understand the pain of waiting :)
    2. This has been asked before and will be again, but I’m adding my voice to the crowd- do you have a Patreon? 
    3. I am a tech writer and editor. If you need a beta, let me know.
    ```

    - u/cthulhuraejepsen:

      I don't have a Patreon, and have been thinking about that for a while now. I *like* not being accountable to anyone, or having a set schedule ... but there's a value to be placed on those things, and I kind of feel like I've been past the point where I rationally *should* have set up at least a tip jar, if not a Patreon.

      Beyond the implied author/reader contract that gets heightened when money is involved, a fair amount of the stuff in this story is personal, and while I've made some effort at disguising it for the eventual day that anonymity was broken, I'm not sure that I can ethically accept payment without at least some weakening of anonymity.

      I'll figure something out, and probably have a decision at the start of Book V in a few days. The smart way of thinking about it is that by not accepting money, I'm basically paying money to be independent/anonymous ... and while I might be able to justify that at $20 a month, I don't think that I could reasonably go higher.
      ```

      - u/notgreat:
        ```
        AFAIK you can do Patreon based on chapter releases instead of monthly if you want. Prevents the need for some sort of schedule.

        The other concerns are definitely still in effect mind you.
        ```

      - u/knite:
        ```
        We’re suggesting Patreon because we have a sneaky ulterior motive - we want you to keep writing! If Patreon will help sustain (or increase) your output, that’s great. If subscribers would feel like a burden, none of your readers want that. 

        Worth the Candle has hundreds, or maybe thousands, of fans. Right now you’re doing us a favor, writing a wonderful story without asking for anything in return. Your readers want to support your writing. Whatever keeps you motivated - Patreon, votes, commentary and praise, tweets - just let us know!
        ```

      - u/Makin-:
        ```
        The introduction of Patreon has slowed down every single serial I've seen except Wildbow's (Mother of Learning being the most glaring example). I think introducing *structured* payment tends to ruin the mindset of quite a few serial writers, since then it feels like a job, as you said.

        I think a tip jar is the best solution, but of course it's up to you. You can set up a company Paypal if you want to hide your identity, and I don't understand your ethical argument. You are delivering a great service anonymously so why shouldn't you get some voluntary reward in the same way? Even if you go the Patreon route, a ton of game developers there stay anonymous all throughout, in my experience.
        ```

        - u/nytelios:
          ```
          MoL actually sped up after Patreon. It used to be monthly. It's probably easier if an author had an existing schedule before introducing Patreon.
          ```

          - u/Makin-:
            ```
            Huh, I could swear it got noticeably slower, maybe there was a hiatus around that time?
            ```

            - u/nytelios:
              ```
              You can see the author's target date for each chapter in his fictionpress bio. A few chapters were late; no hiatus. Now it's ~3 weeks.
              ```

            - u/Wargen-Elite:
              ```
              It was probably the few late chapters which I think happened at the beginningish od the Patreon. IIRC a bunch of people over on /r/noveltranslations were freaking out (myself included) hoping something bad irl hadn't happened to the author and then the next chapter got released. And again.

              Makes sense though. Usually when a Patreon starts up there's a learning curve on how to use it efficiently/figuring out rewards etc, etc, and it slows down the Patreon owner having to figure it out.

- u/Cifems:
  ```
  I can't remember the last time I've felt such a raw sense of *fucking betrayal*, as Not-Mary turned in c72. Terrifying, breathless panic. There's really something visceral about watching loyalty being (apparently) forsaken, just like that. God. Thank fuck you revealed the ploy within the same release or... man, if it had somehow been an unresolved cliffhanger, I don't think I'd even be able to function.


  And then (((this shit))) happened. I was still so shaken from the last chapter that I was sure this meant it was a post-mortem reconstruction of events.
  ```

  - u/adgnatum:
    ```
    I felt it as a physical thing. Chilling, even though the heat was on. That's not a metaphor, I mean actual shaking until I noticed why.

    I'm glad I didn't generate that other hypothesis of yours. Ditto to everything you just said.
    ```

- u/PurposefulZephyr:
  ```
  Got to say- those chapters made me deeply uncomfortable with soul magic. More than I was already, anyway.  
  It's scary especially because it's becoming more and more likely to be *a common thing* in the *near* future, as technology (e.g. new drugs, magnets disabling parts of brain, greater and greater insight into human mind) and... infrastructure (everything collected on us *got* to give an edge to a future manipulative AI or some*one*) now can already achieve a large degree of that.

  > “I’m trying to find the seam of common cause,” said Amaryllis, which fell just short of being a bald-faced lie. She remembered what it had been like to think that Fallatehr was all-encompassing, and that gave her a handle on how to frame her arguments here. True manipulation might come later.

  > “Fallatehr spoke of it in terms of stability,” said Amaryllis. “There’s nothing grounding what Grak feels about Fallatehr, so it should evaporate more quickly, if I understand it right.”

  Honestly wondering to what degree does a soul modification change a person permanently- sure, unsupported changes revert, but it's a two-way pull, and new memories aren't erasable, and those often have the emotional component.  

  > “No,” replied Grak without elaboration. I let him sit and massage where the ropes had been digging into him. “I was … I had purpose.”

  > “Serving Fallatehr,” I said.

  > “It wasn’t service,” said Grak. “It was wanting something more than myself."

  Some insight into Grak's mind, which frankly makes me sad- being mind-raped making an *improvement* in some way suggest a really bad state of mind, which I can relate to. 

  > “Okay,” said Valencia. Her voice was soft. She reached down and touched her dress where it had been ripped. “Are we going to be like sisters?”

  It certainly doesn't help that Valencia is... her own kind of monstrous, mysterious and overpowered, and released upon world at large.  
  In fact, all of them are ridiculously overpowered, one way or another. One safety blanket are limitations of  author's capability and willingness to torture our hero (or anyone, for that matter).

  Let's also not forget the fact that pretty much everyone in World of Jun shares certain character traits (relatively high emotional stability, easy grasp of rationality and self-control, the clear and almost clinical manner of speech (though it's conversational still- not really a criticism, just can't find more accurate expression)), which makes the setting even more dangerous. 

  Enjoying it overall, though. It's high-level play all the way through, laid with munchkinry, careful deliberation and healthy paranoia. Also good characters, in case I made a different impression. 

  Rambling, but yeah, some thoughts.

- u/AurelianoTampa:

  That wait was the worth it! (It being the candle, I suppose).

  Wow, chapter 73 threw me for a loop at first. I was thinking to myself "Wait, have we ever had a chapter without Juniper as the narrator?" and was just about at the point of being worried enough to start flipping through old chapters when I reached (((the explanation.))) It actually made me laugh with relief! 

  It was a good end to the book and arc, but I'm left wondering if we're done with Parsmont. It feels like the team doesn't have any reason to stay, but the introduction of the Abswifth makes me think that the Bendon has to make an appearance somehow. 

  So, we've now solved an issue pressuring Juniper since chapter 27 (or really, chapter 25). Whew! Feels like forever ago! What will the next plot be?

  * Figure out a way to save the Six-Eyed Deer?

  * Find out more about Nellan?

  * Leveling montage?

  * Find a more permanent base of operations?
  ```

  - u/PeridexisErrant:
    ```
    > the introduction of the Abswifth makes me think that the Bendon has to make an appearance somehow.

    Or... maybe it just hangs over the story forever, this vague sense that the Narrative will make the Bendon show up eventually, and the longer it takes the bigger the event will be, but it just. doesn't. happen. and you constantly have to wonder if maybe that's next chapter...

    *This concept brought to you by recent in-story discussion of concerns about subverting narrative expectations.*
    ```

  - u/ArisKatsaris:
    ```
    > Find out more about Nellan?

    I'd guess Nellan to be Fenn's child. I think most readers probably expect this, as it'd then be natural for her to value Nellan more than Juniper. But she showed distaste at having children since they'd be hybrids that'd be treated horribly by both elves and many humans. So if not her child who else could Nellan be? A childhood friend that she feels more loyalty towards than even Juniper?
    ```

  - u/Laborbuch:
    ```
    Well, the immediate next step will be dealing with the orgasmic glory that is level up. Beyond that I fully expect there to be more exploration (and showing off) of the world at large. More immediate, yes, dealing with Parsmont seems to be a thing. Though I wouldn’t be surprised if Joon went off elsewhere and the Bendon biting him in the buttocks later on as an unresolved plot thread.
    ```

- u/sicutumbo:
  ```
  The whole scenario of how Amaryllis was switched, why, and how Joon realized that the person he saw wasn't Amaryllis was really clever. When he noticed that Amaryllis wasn't using the immobility plate, I thought that she was simply waiting for Falltehr to turn his back before betraying him, but I like how it actually happened more.

  I hope that Joon practices with modifying bodies on animals, because if he can get good at it he can fix any injury, or improve his body in any number of ways. At the very least he should be able to sharpen his senses, make himself more resistant to damage, and change his appearance at will. Depending on if Fenn wants to, he could shorten her ears so that she appears human, since I remember that she faces discrimination for being a half elf.
  ```

  - u/adgnatum:
    ```
    > ears

    You've got me thinking about the scars again. Ears, scars, whatever.

    From chapter 25
    > “The worst part was that it worked, for the space of about a week,”

    and

    > the perfection of technique needed to do the scarring right

    It seems plausible that the soft cap at 20 would stop Juniper from repeating the technique himself, even if he could undo it with soul magic (also not obvious).

    But maybe not. I could sort of see it going either way. Since the soul magic is still a secret I can't imagine anyone else routinely redoing the scars.

    They could have worked with him and come away richer for it, I agree. From how Fallatehr was talking to Mary it seemed like he truly did intend to learn about Jun in exchange for teaching him, after which they'd both go their separate ways. 

    However, a big problem (aside from Jun's entirely reasonable inability to establish trust/expose his neck) was that there was a fundamental, insurmountable wall between Jun and Fallatehr in terms of their values. Jun is a morally normal/above average individual. Fallatehr was, or at least came across to me as, a very charming/intelligent but still Mengele-esque sociopath. 

    Jun working with the guy in good faith would have required him to abandon certain of his core values, a big one being what he sees as his personal responsibility to not unleash evil/suffering on the world. This inclination was incompatible with letting Fallatehr continue to practice his soul magic. 

    IMO there was never really any other way this would have ended once Jun learned of how terrible a person Fallatehr was. Killing the guy was the the right course of action, barring a way to quarantine him or disable his soul magic. Not letting the guy gather more knowledge was also the right thing to do, because he couldn't ever have been trusted not to use it to attack Jun.

    PS - Just goes to show how well the author wrote this villain, because I was also kind of rooting for him (in a visceral/knee jerk kind of way) all the way up until the end.
    ```

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    I don't think a healthy working relationship was possible when Fallatehr was putting suicide switches in team mates to ensure he got his way.

    If getting access to Joon was worth more to him than arbitrary numbers of lives - including his allies! - then it would never be safe to trust him. And learning soul magic without trust is, as has just been shown, very dangerous and failure-prone.
    ```

    - u/adgnatum:
      ```
      > A quest that I hadn’t actually seen pop up, now marked as completed, which was something to ponder for another time.

      If we imagine quests are assigned at appropriate times, this one started with the breakout, so it *probably* wasn't missed while Juniper was in his own soul. Maybe the game just didn't want to force his decision by showing him the quest? That seems crucial.

      I'm in the camp of readers who might be saps and still sort of hoped a mutual resolution was possible, but even if they could trust him, I think you're exactly right. They could never trust him to *be good*.

      Probably just as well for all involved that he didn't try to enter the spire.

        From the previous chapter, with the impostor:

        >  “We can’t just leave him here,” said Amaryllis. She glanced over at Grak, then back to me. “You understand that he’s a powerful, illegal, soul mage who knows our names? That was part of the deal we made with him, so that we would have less of an incentive to defect.” 

        Heh, talk about digging your own grave. Never mention the quest accomplished by the death of your leader. *Especially* if no one knows it is a Quest.

  Brainwashing and value editing in stories always gives me the heebie jeebies like no other topic (Luminosity and Time Braid come to mind). That said, this was a great end to the book, even though I wish we got to see Fallatehr's reaction/perspective on Juniper's soul vision and related powers.

  ```

  - u/dalitt:
    ```
    Presumably e.g. the damage to Grak's psychological well-being is included.  It's possible that Fallatehr caused some trouble in Parsmont we don't know about, but it seems like we more or less know how he spent his time.
    ```

  - u/kaukamieli:
    ```
    Doesn't mean he did. Means he had time to do some things, i.e. _could_. He was just a bit preoccupied with dealing with the protagonist.

    So he got struck down before he had a possibility to cause a lot of damage.

- u/adgnatum:
  ```
  The Amaryllis chapter was quite a treat. I wasn't bothered by matched punctuation of any depth in this chapter. Watson justifies the point of view, but Doyle still gets to write from a different perspective. Good fun.

  > Juniper could save her.

  Especially with lines like this. "I could save her" doesn't have the same kind of impact.

  > Dungeon Master, if I must be on your railroad, let me ride the train with good humor. If I must roll the dice, let it be known that I would not object to you fudging. Place a dungeon before me, and I will delve it. Place a dragon before me, and I will slay it. I am, above all else, your player.

  I like to think this wasn't license at all and she recited this to Juniper perfectly in the debrief.

  > “Not sure I was supposed to rescue myself,” she said.

  It is, of course, also satisfying to have her escape, but we then get the extra jab: she wonders if she was *supposed to*. I suppose that is an upper bound to how much effect this narrative talk has: not enough that she doesn't take care of herself.

  A lot of serious topics in this set, but it's a resource and in turn is managed well. I can think of stories that got too serious and never let up; I wouldn't want to read sections of those again. I do not have this problem with *Worth the Candle*.

  > "I’m not sure what I’m reformed into," said Fenn. "Reforming, more like."

  [Okay then.](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7t36op/rtwip_worth_the_candle_ch_71_the_soul_of/dtb7g7j/)

  In that whole discussion I never gave myself license to think that *the odds the author reads it* are very high. On the other hand, maybe this was already planned and all we're doing is perceiving a feature of the text. (If a mathematical proof manages to convince, to the point that the reader is anticipating the next steps of the proof during the initial read, the credit still belongs with the author, not the reader.)

  > "There ought to be some limits to how much a single person can be to you," said Fenn.

  - u/nytelios:
    ```
    'Amaryllis' is the longest chapter to date (I think) and surprisingly it's the first time Joon-as-the-narrator breaking the fourth wall stuck out to me (triple parentheticals: "I hope you don't mind" "Okay, back to the story"). The narrator is *aware* that he's giving the reader a narrative and in this case, an anecdotal history. But it's really the "I hope you don't mind" line that threw me off. It makes it seem like he's invested in creating a good narrative and I can't help but feel that it's a clue into the nature of the story (is the real Joon creating a fictional story within a fictional story based on a true story that involved playing out fictional stories?). Also addressed to /u/eaglejarl since I saw his comment during a re-read: it broke immersion for me as well and these were my thoughts as to *why*.

    > In that whole discussion I never gave myself license to think that the odds the author reads it are very high.

    I'm certain the author reads the comments and they've left traces of influence in the story in the past. Though I'm not sold that Fenn's reforming is a response to that comment. Channeling the razor, it's easier to say Fenn grew attracted to Joon-the-sap and he's been a moralizing influence ever since. The tower would have accelerated her awareness of that.
    ```

- u/XxChronOblivionxX:
  ```
  Thank the Dungeon Master that this arc filled with unease and paranoia is over. Falletehr was a really scary villain and was also in the camp of "fuck I don't even know if he is one". Then the whole party had that mutual distrust that they all agreed on but really strained their sense of companionship and that stuff makes me blegh. Amaryllis shined in her chapter.
  ```

- u/Green0Photon:
  ```
  The real question is whether Valencia can use a dead person's soul instead of a devil's soul. It's a perfect solution to fixing the container and teaching Juniper more soul magic. Though, I wouldn't place F's soul in Valencia immediately. I don't know if he could still be dangerous.
  ```

- u/Veedrac:
  ```
  I really enjoyed this book, and this wrap-up was excellent, though I have this nagging feeling that Fallatehr's plan was weak and if he should by all means have won if he played it straight.

  If Fallatehr expected to be seen through quickly, and it seems to me that he should have, and he was actually OK with indirect forms of learning, why wouldn't he have apparated to another continent with his hostages and negotiated indirectly?

  He took a huge amount of risk in order to soulfight Juniper, but then did very little to prevent the obvious countermeasure of stabbing. If you're going to sacrifice your strongest assets, eg. Amaryllis' loyalty, to engineer a face-to-face confrontation, you should have good reasons to believe that controntation is more favourable than you could have organised without the element of surprise.

    It was more comprehensive in the original draft, with the various scenarios being planned for and argued about, but it felt like a lot of faff, especially because those scenarios would be revealed in 73, where there's zero tension, and I've never really found post-facto explanations to read that well.

    Like, "Fallatehr was standing beneath the light specifically because that was a place that Grak had warded to protect him, in case of ambush" is all well and good, but if it's explained after the fact, and pointless to the narrative, rather than as a "turn" in the beats of the scene, what's the point? (The point is to show some cleverness, or make sure there's not a 'plot hole', but I kind of go back and forth on how much that's worth it -- I'm obviously not shy about including things because I think they're neat, even if they're not plot relevant.)

    Fallatehr's perception/read is that he has literally all of Juniper's teammates captured and at the knife, and that the result will be submission and/or breaking to the strength of coercion ... but his last effort is to invoke the name of Amaryllis, and Juniper just stabs him anyway, despite this (from ch 73):

    > She had been the one to explain that she meant something to Juniper, that he might be compelled to act foolishly in order to save her.

    But I've always believed that you can't defend a work on the basis of something that's not actually in the text, and this is stepping somewhat beyond my normal author/reader line, so I will go slinking off into the shadows once more.
    ```

    - u/Veedrac:
      ```
      I actually understood most of that from the text; my disagreement persists despite it.

      > Fallatehr's perception/read is that he has literally all of Juniper's teammates captured and at the knife, and that the result will be submission and/or breaking to the strength of coercion

      Fundamentally the issue is that, if this is your expectation, immediate direct confrontation doesn't give you anything that bargaining at a distance doesn't. Fallatehr could have stolen away every companion and traded them piecemeal; not doing so implies that Juniper would be *more* willing to submit in a short-term confrontation than over a long-term bargain from a weaker position. I don't see Amaryllis making that judgement.

      This holds double given Fallatehr gained rather significant assets with, eg., the teleportation key.
      ```

  - u/serge_cell:
    ```
    Remote confrontation wouldn't be consistent with my read on Fallatehr character. He is not cautious chess player, he is gambler. If he would prefer slow accumulation of advantages he would stay in prison. Fallatehr went for direct confrontation because it was fun and allow for instant gratification by taking over Juniper in one hit. Also he didnt internalize how freaking strong Juniper is. Fallather was hundreds years old elf with immense luck and experince, and Juniper was Out of Context problem for him.

  I was absolutely convinced that the quest "They Say You Can’t Go Home Again" was foreshadowing, and that he'd need to find his biological brother for a proper transplant.

  The Amaryllis chapter was an interesting deviation.

  Once it was explained what was going on there was a fun little game of trying to work out what parts of the chapter were pieces that Amaryllis had told Juniper, and where the chapter was giving us Joon's opinion of her. Same thing with the actual prose itself really, some of it felt very much like Juniper, some of it was him imagining her (and some of it felt like it was straight up Amaryllis' voice).

  I'm not sure I like the third-person-by-proxy-of-first-person as much as straight first or third, but it was certainly fun.

  >(End Book IV)

  Thanks for the heads up. I'm not sure whether this should be a separate post but IMO an "end of book" should either be an additional tag or an end of volume should count as [c] so it's easier to find these posts.

  I worry soulfuckery will become a trap where editing and discussing the as of yet unrevealed excel sheets full of data is going to take up time from everything else that's going on (I was worried 40 skills + unknown amount of virtues was going to either lead to too much fiddling with the character sheet or basically ignoring a host of options and to be fair Joon has yet to make proper study of what blood magic was said to be able to do).

  Is there a reason juniper’s essentialism increased to 23, over the usual cap of 20? Or am I missing something?

  Had a lot of fun reading this!
  ```

  - u/cthulhuraejepsen:
    ```
    The usual soft cap of 20 applies to "amateur training", which is theorized (and so far consistent with) this reading in ch 37:

    > Being capped at 20 because of how I was training was shockingly bad for me. It meant that I couldn’t just train up my Dodge skill against Fenn and hope that our Twinned Souls would allow her offensive power to keep pace so that she was a challenge. The word ‘amateur’ implied that a professional could still help me train, while the word ‘training’ implied that I could still get skills from actual combat, or maybe from other methods. I tried not to dwell on that too much, but it was bad news at a time when my morale was low.

    Meaning that if you're actually *doing something* with the skill, rather than just trying to grind it out through repetition, you can pass 20, as well as if you make the effort to seek out a good teacher who can give you better, more intensive training (though we haven't seen the teacher hypothesis tested yet).

    (There are a number of tabletop games that have some mechanism like this in place, though from what I've seen it's usually just GM discretion on whether to award a player for trivial actions, because any rigid definition will immediately be gamed by the player in a way that's usually detrimental to play.)

  Word-choice comment--

  "After five minutes had passed, I checked my skills, and saw that Bows was still down a point, and One-handed Weapons had reverted to 21, which confirmed that the times multiplied"

  Each frequency is (1point)/(10min); multiplying would give 1/100, whereas adding(/'compounding'?) gives (2points)/(10min), which an interface could present either as (1point)/(5min) (this case) or 2 points lost together after 10 minutes past (not this case).  (Edit:  Just the times multiplying would still be 100 minutes(^2).)

  Edit:  Oh!  Oh!  I remember the term now!  'which confirmed that the rates stacked' !  (As how a stacking AC +1 and a stacking AC +2 give a total AC +3, but if they're non-stacking only give AC +2.  Or was it -2?)

  I am glad that this arc is over. In a lot of fiction I enjoy the whole mind control element and how it impacts politics/interpersonal relationships, but Fallatehr just wasn't very engaging. I tend to like it in more emotional/character driven stories so maybe that's the issue. That isn't to say that I didn't like all the other parts of this arc. The action sequences and worldbuilding aspects were really fun. 

  I look forward to seeing what long term consequences this arc has. I kinda hope Fallatehr planted some 'bombs' in the Grak's and Amaryllis's souls, I can't imagine that a soul mage with centuries to hone his skills and who was one of the best soul mages in an empire with the best soul magic would limit themselves to only increasing his own value in their value systems (regarding the quality of the second empire's magic: ok, I'm not sure if this is literally true, it's just the impression I got and nobody in the story is in a really good position to check and see if the second empire had the best soul magic out there.). Regardless, I think that the soul magic will definitely have long term effects on Grak and, to a limited extent, Amaryllis. I also expect that Fallatehr managed to fuck up world politics in some (probably minor) way. Additionally, He probably had time to enthrall random people.

  Moving on to a more exciting topic, Valencia. In many respects she's like a child. She's probably never before had the opportunity to make decisions and is learning how. I can't imagine that fight to the death going on right in front of her eyes helped her develop in a purely positive manner. It seems that she is in the process of developing her moral code/center. None of the other characters seem aware of this? I think mistakes will be made and I hope that they don't have disastrous consequences.

  We haven't seen much about the locus/six-eyed doe yet. To be fair they haven't been part of the story for very long and haven't had much opportunity to act besides. I do worry that we are reaching the point where adding more companions just means that other companions won't be developed or their development will halt, which would be a shame. For this reason I hope that Valencia is the last member of their kharass (barring somebody like Arthur). Of course I could be underestimating cthulhuraejepson's skill, in which case I'm worrying about nothing.

    I don't think ~~Disney is going to go make *Fallatehr: A Candle Story* to answer our unasked questions~~ there was a whole lot more going on with him as a character, but I thought he made for engaging *scenes*. Seeing how the party struggled against his threat was the point even when he wasn't nearby, and I thought it did that well.

    He was a cunning negotiator with Amaryllis, odious to Fenn, and a teacher to Juniper.

    > I haven’t known very many people. Most of them were Fallatehr.

    The truth of that sentence is bad enough *out* of context. I bet he'll still have some impact through Valencia.

  There's something about the slow reversion/decay of Soul editing that doesn't make sense to me... I though the whole point of soul editing was to change the baseline "normal" state of the soul - which would imply that the edit now becomes the new normal.

  I can rationalize it partly if some changes are in conflict with some other changes, i.e. Amarylis' value on self preservation conflicting heavily with her Fallatehr boner - but that just seems like a poor editing job that created an unstable set of values. A skilled soul mage should be able to edit multiple values into a new equilibrium that doesn't decay - say by lowering the values which conflict with the intended edits. A ham-fisted way to do it could be by creating a meta value of "values the person/state I was in before meeting Fallatehr" and set that in the heavy negatives; whereas a more subtle way to do it would be to look at existing values in the soul that conflict and lowering all of them to a certain degree until a stable equilibrium of new values emerge.

  Another way to do it would be to just wholesale copy over the soul mages' existing value system - delete or set to zero every single value in the poor fucker and copy over everything since you know that is a stable equilibrium.
