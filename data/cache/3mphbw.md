  My first pick is going to be tough, but once I have it... I defer the next two picks to them. What's the point in hiring talent if you're not going to use it?

  Can I revive myself? Obeying me unconditionally sounds great.

  See previous posts on what you can do with perfect willpower.

  Wait for someone extremely rich and powerful to suffer a life-threatening accident, spam revives at them till it takes. With any luck it'll be explained away as 'oh they just died on the operating table for a few seconds'. 

  Intelligence is nice in a minion, but hilarious amounts of money and power are more vital for such an undertaking. Political leaders are nice, but democracy ensures you're paying for only a few years of actual use, and you can't really have them do much because in most cases their party can just have a vote of no confidence. 

  Next step, using my money and power to kill someone who has *all* the blackmail material, like the director of the NSA. This time have some fancy detectors pointed at me (and if possible him/her) while reviving. I mean, I *probably* can't recreate this phenomena, but on the off-chance I can then It's worth investing the resources.

  At that point though I kinda peter out. There is no one person sufficiently intelligent or rich to conquer the world. Unless there is and they're competent enough that we don't know about it. Spend some resources to find out who the next most powerful or useful person on the planet is. Chinese intelligence head? Really rich dude? If possible use it on myself? Take em over anyway.

  Attempt to blackmail all of the congressmen and senators and news agencies and what have you to slowly twist the world in the direction I want it twisted. Try to have people under my command be pulling all of the strings. That's about as far as I get though. I can influence the world and maybe turn it a little bit into what I consider a better place, but conquering it is unlikely.

  Wait wait wait wait.  You have the power to resurrect the dead, and you're asking me to use it for conquest?

  What the fuck is wrong with you!?

    Only three people, and they seem to become zombie mind slaves. What would you use it for?

      Figuring out the process by which you are given the power to reveive the dead, obviously. It's the wishing for more wishes answer.

  I shoot the obama, putin, and xu jinping (sp? The dude who "leads" china).

  That's about 2 billion people under my control right there.

    "Revive" makes it sound like they have to be dead, which makes your plan harder and significantly more hilarious
    ```

    - u/GaBeRockKing:
      ```
      The intent is to make them dead. I only need one, and the other two are much easier.
      ```

      - u/blazinghand:

        Right, and the part where you make them dead before reviving them will be awesome. Step 0 to world domination is kill three of the hardest-to-kill men on the planet. Now all we need is a laser in space.

          I can just kamikaze Obama, then have him pardon me at some later date Hell, it would likely even raise his favorability rating.

            If you visibly kill the president and revive him, I'm almost certain the US wouldn't accept Zombama as their leader
            ```

  - u/Ozimandius:
    ```
    Obama only has a little over a year left.  Better to wait for the next president at this point and maybe get 8 years out of them.

    Or maybe kill a billionaire like Gates or Carlos Slim.  Money is power, and Gates is pretty universally liked.

      If I can nab all three, I can manufacture a world war and invent some sort of pretense for re-electing obama for a third term.

        **Twenty Second Amendment to the United States Constitution**

        **Section 1.** No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice, and no person who has held the office of President, or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of the President more than once. But this article shall not apply to any person holding the office of President when this article was proposed by the Congress, and shall not prevent any person who may be holding the office of President, or acting as President, during the term within which this article becomes operative from holding the office of President or acting as President during the remainder of such term.

          Obvious solution: Revive FDR. He predates the amendment.

            Ooh, sneaky.  I think it would need to be Truman, though, since it says: 

            > But this article shall not apply to any person holding the office of President **when this article was proposed by the Congress,**

            ...not "or before this amendment".  It was *passed* in 1951, but *proposed* in 1947.  Truman was President in both those years.

          Easy. Just use the war as a pretext for passing laws that wouldn't otherwise have passed. We've suspended habeus corpus before.

            Do you mean laws that will let you re-elect Obama? That's not actually a thing you can do. That requires a Constitutional Amendment, which is rather harder.

            Article V of the Constitution prescribes how an amendment can become a part of the Constitution. While there are two ways, only one has ever been used. All 27 Amendments have been ratified after two-thirds of the House and Senate approve of the proposal and send it to the states for a vote. Then, three-fourths of the states must affirm the proposed Amendment.

            The other method of passing an amendment requires a Constitutional Convention to be called by two-thirds of the legislatures of the States. That Convention can propose as many amendments as it deems necessary. Those amendments must be approved by three-fourths of the states.

            The actual wording of Article V is: “The Congress, whenever two thirds of both Houses shall deem it necessary, shall propose Amendments to this Constitution, or, on the Application of the Legislatures of two thirds of the several States, shall call a Convention for proposing Amendments, which, in either Case, shall be valid to all Intents and Purposes, as part of this Constitution, when ratified by the Legislatures of three fourths of the several States, or by Conventions in three fourths thereof, as the one or the other Mode of Ratification may be proposed by the Congress; Provided that no Amendment which may be made prior to the Year One thousand eight hundred and eight shall in any Manner affect the first and fourth Clauses in the Ninth Section of the first Article; and that no State, without its Consent, shall be deprived of its equal Suffrage in the Senate.”

  I'm afraid that it might be a teacher's password here, but one of the best shots at *taking over the world* seems to be to make an fAI. Revive two great mathematicians and a great leader/organiser/planner of small organisations (probably all from the 20th century), and you'll likely be the head of the best AI research team in the world, and therefore have the best shot at making the fAI which conquers the world (for you).
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    We already have  AI teams, and mathematicians (honestly, it's a question of which mathematician is a Great Man, and whose work has been incorporated by talented enough people but it's beyond my competency).



    I don't think that three people, even Great Men, can really do things like that, or can be so superior to current organizations*. There's a sort of plasticity in scifi, where geniuses can do outlandish things, which gives some leeway but just assuming three real people? Much harder.


    *Unless you swap one of them out with someone with a ridiculous fortune.

  Three people raised from the dead to conquer the world.

  I will assume that they will be capable of surviving for more than a short time.  My power will give them the ability to live for many years.

  The first thing is going to be money.  We need someone who will have access to money, even if they have died and lost it.  One of the Saudi princes would do.  Resurrect them shortly after their death, before the transferal of power has occurred.

  Firstly, they will have lots of money because of the simple fact that they are alive.  Secondly, they just rose from the dead.  This would definitely classify as a miracle to religious true believers, especially if they were dead for long enough that there was absolutely no doubt that he was dead.  Even better if he was embalmed.  (I don't know Islamic burial rites.)

  I now practically own at least half of the religious population of the Middle East, and substantial blocks of Muslim true believers elsewhere.  I immediately establish a Caliphate in the Saudi Prince's name.

  Next up, Mahatma Ganhdi.  Another miraculous resurrection.  Cult of personality in India, funded by Saudi Arabian money.

  And finally, George Washington.  There's genetic material of his still around to prove it's him.  There's a pretty damn good chance that the US public would be rather vocal about getting him back in the President's seat, and damn the constitution.

  The Saudi Prince's money would go through Gandhi to fund George's efforts to get the 22nd amendment repealed.

  Between the Caliphate in the Middle East, Gandhi in India, and the enthralled Americans, I now have secondhand control of about a fifth of the world population and a rather substantial percentage of global GDP.

  That's a good start.

  >1. I'd wait until after the next US president is elected, have them shot, then immediately revive them before anyone notices that they had died. Wham, I now have nuclear weapons.

  >2. One of the 9/11 hijackers. Due to their extremely verifiable status of being dead, they'd be able to gather _major_ support with their resurrection.

  >3. John Paul II - again, his death was extremely verifiable, so he'll have a massive religious following after his resurrection.

  Jesus Christ, Muhammed, Nikolai Tesla.  The first two to get over half the world's population (who conveniently seem to be relatively easy to convince of things) and the last to build some amazing technology to take over the world.  Jesus and Muhammed should be able to get me enough manpower and money to invest into whatever genius ideas Nikolai can come up with.

  There is of course the major problem of convincing people that it is actually Jesus or Muhammed.  And the possibility that Jesus didn't exist is always a concern, but presumably I wouldn't be wasting my power if it didn't work.
