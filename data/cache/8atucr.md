## The March North [RT][C][HF?]

### Post:

Features:

* Magical focus items, which civilians use in groups to remove dangerous Flora, and the military uses to shield themselves from arrows, power artillery, and create roads.

* a partly Geas bound society. Politicians can't lie without catching on fire, powerful mages are bound to stay out of politics, and must serve the government every few years (5 years in 50?)

* Interesting worldbuilding, though the author really doesn't hold your hand, and a lot of it is glossed over by the POV, as they already understand their society.

* The setting features the consequences of thousands of years of irresponsible mages. Rivers that change from water, to lava, to blood on a regular schedule. Extremely dangerous Flora and Fauna. Sentient mountain ranges that dislike being terraformed. Wide swathes of land blocked by heavy wards, occupied only by what are presumably a mages creations gone rogue. Former super soldiers finding a place in society.

* Fortresses created out of farmed and harvested human misery.

* Creating magical drayage and harvesting resources via magic.

I initially bought the first book when it was on a major sale (down to $2?). I noticed it appears to be on sale again.

It's definitely worth checking out. The writing style can be a bit opaque and hard to follow at first, but the author has some interesting ideas, and the characters are rational and interesting.

  I strongly suggest that people read the offered sample of the chapter before they buy it. The author writes in a very unusual way which is hard to describe (definitely not amateurish!), [but one consequence is ](#s "that there are no or very few pronouns (he, she) in the entire book which can be very confusing for readers. In *A Succession of Bad Days*, I wasn't sure about the gender of one main character introduced in the beginning until near to the end of the book.")

  I actually didn't like *The March North* very much. However, I greatly enjoyed the second book in the series, *[A Succession of Bad Days](https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Graydon_Saunders_A_Succession_of_Bad_Days?id=tYyxCQAAQBAJ)*, which largely has a different cast of characters and plotline to the point where *The March North* feels as if it is a prequel rather than the first in a series. You can read either books independently of each other without any issues to the ordering.

    The books sound awesome and I really want to read them but I checked out authors blog and read their input on the gun violence thing. Uhhh... is that satire? Are those kind of views going to be in the novels?

    EDIT: Read more posts and my concern over reading propaganda has increased.

      Having not known his personal views before reading the novels I never felt preached to in any way. It’s possible that that could change if you go in primed to look for such things. 
      I don’t agree with his blog writings at all fwiw.

      holy damn fuck. I thought you were exaggerating about his views but reading 3 pages into his posts on the blog and i am seriously concerned.

      I talked to neo-maonist and i dont know which is worse

      Wow. That post would completely turn me off reading any of his novels, had I seen it before I read the book. I have no interest in checking out a particular author's work after seeing what they posted to r/fantasy, for similar reasons.

      However, in this case, I feel it's more like Orson Scott Card, who is  incredibly homophobic in real life, but that doesn't really show up in any of his works I've read.

      I've only read The March North so far though, so I can't speak for the sequels.

    I entirely agree. The writing is initially very hard to follow. There are references to things that aren't initially explained, and certain phrases almost seem intentionally opaque. It's best to try out the novel before buying it, though I personally feel it gets better. 

    However, I would prefer you spoiler the second part, after the quoted text. It ruins any sense of surprise of a certain plot twist if you give that up, and it isn't really the part of the writing that will make things hard to understand.

    While I personally find it a noteworthy facet of the writing, I deliberately didn't mention it for that reason.

    Edit: I'd also mention that the first book is more action oriented, while the second book, at least what I've read of it, has dramatically less conflict. I need to get around to finishing it one of these days.

      I don't agree that it is meant to be a plot-twist, but if you think it is, better safe then sorry.

      While the second book is less action packed, it involves the characters being students learning about magic which is a lot of fun for me. There's also a lot of infrastructure study and building involved which is reasonable when you have a society heavily dependent on magic and you're teaching the people who will be responsible for the infrastructure.

  I have not read the prequel but I have read the latest two novels, based on a recommendation from this sub, and very much enjoyed them. I’ve been keeping tabs on the authors blog, eagerly awaiting the latest in the series.

  It’s worth noting that the authors writing style, while definitely unusual, is not amateurish. I personally can handle that a lot better than the latter but YMMV.

  I love Graydons work. Firstly, just because he is a very competent writer, and secondly, because he is writing fantasy that does not just bolt magic onto a medieval setting, despite this making no sense from a world building perspective. 

  As a random example, I do not recall ever seeing another piece of literature that points out the fact that the number of people one farmer can feed is hugely important to the kind of society you can have. 
  And yes, he is progressive, which, as far as his books are concerned mostly just means he writes books that are *not* just cookie-cutter copies of the extremely reactionary political setups most fantasy novels have. Which makes them far more interesting than most fantasy
