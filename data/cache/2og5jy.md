  I love how the presentation makes it look like the Inland Revenue delivers the notice to Malfoy even before Fiona hungs up the phone. Some speed indeed!

    There is one thing that Government runs fast for and that is back taxes.

  Five gold says Milo is going to figure out a way to cast some kind of resurrection spell on the dementors.

    We don't know anything about the true nature of the dementors though - dementors being death is only canon for HPMOR.

      But given DnD stats, they are probably either undead or a negative energy outsider.  Either way [Revive Kills Zombie](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReviveKillsZombie) is in effect and Milo can counter it.

        Dementors are from the Potterverse, so it's not clear to me that they would even have a type. It's certainly worth him *trying* to kill them with some kind of resurrection spell, but given the strange interactions between the two different rulesets, it's certainly not a given. I'm actually still waiting to figure out whether Potterverse characters have an alignment - something that Milo should know by now, given that he can *detect evil* at will through his prestige class.

        D&D Wizards have little access to revive effects directly - the best ways to get it would all involve problematic spells. You might be able to use lesser planar binding to pull in something with the desired effect as a spell-like ability (as the limit of allowed monster manuals approaches infinity, the power of planar binding and polymorph spells go to infinity!).

        As far as dealing with undead directly, you might have more luck with Undeath to Death, Command Undead, or Control Undead, or for extraplanar stuff use Banishment or generic save-or-dies. 

        As far as Revive Kills Zombies goes, in HP canon it doesn't seem to be a thing and in D&D 3e/3.5e's undead subtype:

        >Not affected by raise dead and reincarnate spells or abilities. Resurrection and true resurrection can affect undead creatures. These spells turn undead creatures back into the living creatures they were before becoming undead.

        That said, you can do hit point damage with the *cure* line of spells to undead, but those spells *suck* except maybe the 6th level harm/heal and Milo has little in the way of access to them anyways.

      Oh, come on--surely it's obvious what dementors really represent. ;)
      ```

        ```
        J.K. Rowling has said that depression was the inspiration for dementors. EY changed them to death.
        ```

- u/None:
  ```
  Poor Malfoy
  ```

  - u/eaglejarl:
    ```
    Seriously!  Man, Fiona is *nasty* when she's pissed.
    ```

- u/coriolinus:
  ```
  It's worth noting that Milo's been using amulets of Protection from Good ever since he undied. If anything in the HP universe counts as an Evil Creature, dementors do; I can't help but wonder if an amulet of Protection from Evil would have saved his bacon just now.
