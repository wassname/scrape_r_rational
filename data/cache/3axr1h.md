  You should probably make this its own thread; right now, you're hardly making much of a splash in the raging river of the main discussion thread. Explaining more about the original world might also help garner interest. 

  As an idle thought: one of the main appeals of SotL is observing the emergent social effects of one phenomenon that works on a universal level, and you lose that if you simply take that phenomenon and make it a one-off bound to a single main character. It's up to you if that's a problem you actually want to tackle, or even consider a problem at all.

    Giving this its own thread would probably help it a fair amount. I enjoyed reading it.

    I am not a highly proficient storyteller. I'm a good writer on the prose level, but I quite frankly don't have the chops to do anything with a coherent plot, let alone social consequences or themes. I just wrote this for fun.

    Did *not* expect it to end up on /r/rational. The only reason the plot doesn't dictate everything is because there's no plot to do the dictating!
