  I finally got around to giving this another go, and I think I'm glad I did. The author explicitly attempted to reintroduce the idea that magic is weird and not understandable, but I think they succeeded too well - it went beyond "this is weird and I don't understand the mechanics behind it" to "I have no idea what the hell is happening or what half the setting is".

   This is in large part because it's missing the real world juxtaposition the original Harry Potter series had - rather than half wizards and half real world to orient yourself from, it's half wizards and half alternate reality dystopia, and the dystopia sections were focused on a particularly weird and confusing part. It was only in the last two/three chapters I really got my feet under me enough to manage more than parsing what the hell is going on in the scene.

  You nail the tone of HJPEV *perfectly*. I keep forgetting that, and then with each new chapter it's a pleasant surprise.

    Also, little thing I didn't notice on my first read:

    > Harry closed his eyes and snapped his fingers. Something about the motion made her wary.
    ```

- u/scruiser:
  ```
  I like the way this author’s version of HJPEV has learned to moderate his long diatribes into shorter explanations.  It fits what several years of growing up might do and it makes the story flow smoother.

    ```
    Yes. Oh, yes.

  >and been expelled from Stanford after publishing a doctorate thesis entitled 'A Novel Means of Reversing Cryptographic Transformations of Names of God'.

  Nice unsong refence there.

  I really liked the fic before but what really cemented it was HJPEV finally becoming a close cast character, I hope to see more of him around in the future

  I think that was perhaps the best and most in character anti-climax I've read in quite a while.
  ```

- u/destravous:
  ```
  There where so many big words in quick succession. It was an entertaining read to be sure, looking forward to the next installment!

  ```
  I'm calling it now, HJPEV made the mysterious reality warping cup whatever it's called and it rewrote reality to the way it is in the story. Probably from a universe where he didn't take the unbreakable vow.

  Also, I thought Ozland was secretly HJPEV. But now the actual HJPEV shows up? What's going on here I wonder.

  for newcomers who want a general overview, this is an hpmor fanfanfic which draws on significant digits and to a lesser extent, orders of magnitude.

  it takes place in 1995, in an alternate universe (well, not quite) where the department of mysteries has discovered an almost unlimited well of magic (with consequences), muggleborns are prevented from attending hogwarts until their fifth year and often learn to control and develop their accidental magic, while wizarding society has experienced an incomplete industrial revolution, illicitly financed by contracts with muggle governments and corporations.

  the first chapter is confusing but it'll be a while until i figure out how to reorganise it.
