## Short fiction writing events

### Post:

Hey guys! Anyone here feel like doing some themed writing? I've been thinking it would be fun to hold a few events where people write stories in different genres. Could be a different genre every couple of months. I would be very interested in doing a spooky story writing event, or writing a romance for February. But I'm curious if this is something you guys would be interested in. If it is, how could we make it happen?

  We actually used to have a biweekly writing contest with a new prompt each week. It eventually ended due to lack of participation. You could probably find the threads and look through them if you're on the hunt for prompts (and then compare your own takes with everyone else's).

    I think this could work better under some conditions:

    1. it has to be more of an "event". A biweekly continuously running contest becomes simply background noise, you keep telling yourself that maybe you'll take part in the next one and then never do;  
    2. it has to be properly short, so that people see it as a lot of fun with relatively small time investment. Like, do-it-in-some-free-time-over-the-weekend short;  
    3. it has to have interesting and stimulating enough templates. Restrictions often aid creativity, don't impede it, as they allow you to focus your attention on a smaller section of the space of possibilities. Just a single word is often very little, for that purpose.

    Under these conditions I think a small event of this sort could be feasible. I'm down for stuff like 500-word stories or even shorter, in particular. They can be really fun to write as you try to work your ideas into the word count limit.

      Good ideas! My thoughts:

      1. Agreed
      2. I'd prefer a longer event, but I also take longer to write things. Flash fiction is fun but doesn't seem much different from the biweekly writing prompt.
      3. What about optional prompts? I agree that constraints can bring out creativity, but poor prompts can be restrictive. It also puts more pressure on the person planning the monthly events, whoever that might be.

        Absolutely agree on optional prompts. One contest I once took part in that was very fun included multiple prompts that were not just sentences but also pictures and songs - and you had to pick one from each bunch. A good balance between freedom and limitations.

    Hmm...I have wondered about promoting participation. I think writing to a prompt can be tricky, and perhaps less fun than simply trying out a new genre. Many writers can get stuck in a rut of writing the same old thing, and might like a chance to stretch their creative muscles. Alternatively, some people enjoy writing in one or two genres, but would love an opportunity to show off their work. :)

    I also think bi-weekly could be stretched out to once a month/two months. That gives people time to think up and write a story they feel comfortable sharing. Also, giving out a calendar for the year might help. Example: January: Sci-fi, February: Romance, March: Humor, etc. Authors have more time to plan and it gives them something to look forward to.

      I like the idea of doing it every one or two months.

      Alternate between detailed prompts and genres from event to event then. Fits both interests and makes each type of event more 'special' for thoae interested

  I would enjoy this, in principle! I think it would work best with some changes compared to ye olde biweekly contest. See my other comment: https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/kpvwov/short_fiction_writing_events/gi248x9/.

  Based on the response to your post, it seems like there's interest. The question then, as you said, is how to actually make it happen. 

  My experience: When I ran this year's Secret Krampus contest, I just messaged the mods first for permission, and they were cool with it. They even stickied the contest threads and put them in contest mode for me. So you could probably run a genre-themed event yourself, just by following the same process. This would be less work for you than a prompt exchange contest like Krampus, since you wouldn't need to distribute prompts. You could further reduce your workload by having people post their stories in the thread themselves, like in the old biweekly contests, instead of DMing them to you to post. So the workload for you would be writing the event post, requesting permission/sticky/contest mode from the mods, and potentially announcing the winner if you want to run it like a contest. If you don't want it to be a long-term commitment, maybe you could accompany the event with a request for a volunteer to run the next one, and they could do the same when it's their turn, and so on.

  What do you think? Would you be interested in running an event?

    Hmm I'll have to think it over. Thanks for the info!
