  Nice try, Pomfrey/Moody! You've convinced Ginny it was you who used leglimency earlier and not Moody polyjuiced as you. We're not falling for that!
  ```

  - u/kaukamieli:
    ```
    Moody? Obviously Rubeus "Shouldn't have said that" Hagrid!
    ```

    - u/sephlington:
      ```
      It was obviously all of the Cedrices, but it's nice to see some more outside-of-the-box ideas flying around.
      ```

      - u/Jello_Raptor:
        ```
        ***grumble***

        It's **Cedrics** as in "It was obviously all of the *Cedrics Diggory* ..."
        ```

        - u/GopherAtl:
          ```
          Only one way to settle dispute: discard both in favor of Cedri. 

          ...

          Or not.

          Maybe Cedripodes?
          ```

          - u/Jello_Raptor:
            ```
            I don't know, Cedripodes sound like a class of creature that have Cedrics for feet.
            ```

            - u/LiteralHeadCannon:
              ```
              You mean /r/HPMOR?
              ```

- u/Adamantium9001:
  ```
  Well that settles it: Ginny's another Riddle. (Note to the author: by having Pomfrey *literally say it out loud*, you make it look like you think your readers are idiots. With the revelation of the wards malfunctioning, the foreshadowing was *already* about as subtle as a punch to the face.)

  Was Pomfrey this competent in HPMOR? Her behaviour here strikes me as out-of-character, but I could be wrong. Her brusqueness initially reminded me of Amelia Bones, but I guess it's more likely that this is still polyjuiced Moody.

  Also, Lesath. Also, DracoxGinny. This is gonna be interesting.
  ```

  - u/blazinghand:
    ```
    As time passes, the polyjuiced Moody theory only grows in strength. Speculating about small children secretly being dark wizards is pretty typical Moody.

    I'd read an Alastor Moody fic
    ```

    - u/sephlington:
      ```
      "Alastor Moody and the **Constant Vigilance**!"

      "Alastor Moody and the **Constant Vigilance**!"

      "Alastor Moody and the **Constant Vigilance**!"

      And, my personal favourite, "Alastor Moody and the Vial of Bahl's Stupefaction", which was a sequel fic to "Alastor Moody and the **Constant Vigilance**!"
      ```

  - u/Transfuturist:
    ```
    I'm fairly disappointed with the author's execution.
    ```

- u/scooterboo2:
  ```
  Well, looks like Ginny is just going to have to sign a magical contract in order to become a magical girl.
  ```

  - u/CopperZirconium:
    ```
    I knew it! Pomfrey is obviously Kubey!
    ```

    - u/scooterboo2:
      ```
      There now needs to be a meta meta fiction where Ginny becomes a mahou shoujo to solve her, erm, "boy problems".
      ```

      - u/CopperZirconium:
        ```
        That could totally happen. The S.P.H.E.W. was a magical girl team and Hermione in particular is clearly Homura.
        ```

        - u/scooterboo2:
          ```
          Nuh-uh. Harry is clearly Homura, just look at the time travel and use of guns. Herminone is more of a Madoka. She dies, and the Homura vows to fix her death, no matter how much time travel is involved.
          ```

          - u/Jello_Raptor:
            ```
            Not all that much, as it turns out.
            ```

- u/Gurkenglas:
  ```
  Lucius has a horcrux! Who had been Tim?
  ```

  - u/Adamantium9001:
    ```
    It took me about 20 minutes to even understand your chain of logic. And my response is no. Just...no. It's way more plausible that Draco thought of his father because he's still not used to him being dead, and Tim is someone whom Draco now corresponds with regularly in the same way he used to do with Lucius.
    ```

    - u/Jello_Raptor:
      ```
      I feel like the most plausible hypothesis is [spoiler](#s "Draco got the journal while rummaging through his dad's stuff, and ... now is talking with 'Timothy Morfin Riddle'?")
      ```

- u/Sailor_Vulcan:
  ```
  I think the concept of "magical gender" really needs to better defined and elaborated on. What is "magical gender"? And why would it have anything to do with dorm assignments?

  Also, how might magical gender actually be related to "mental gender" or "physical gender"? Why is there such a strong correlation, according to Madam Pomfrey? One possible explanation is that "magical gender" isn't really a gender, but rather your "magical style/personality", which determines the kinds of spells you prefer to cast and are good at, and the strong correlation to actual gender is because differences of both "mental gender" and "magical gender" are influenced by the learned and inherited personality differences between people of different genders/sexes. The correlation between "magical gender" and "physical gender" could just be because people with a certain "mental gender" tend to have the corresponding "physical gender".
  ```

  - u/DrunkenQuetzalcoatl:
    ```
    As I understood it "magical gender" is just the binary magical answer to the question if someone is male or female. Because that is exactly what is needed for the dorm protection magic. The barrier can't let you half-pass or 60% pass. It lets you in or not.
    ```

- u/Kishoto:
  ```
  I'm really enjoying the story so far, but I'm finding the chapter length to be a real issue. It's just my personal preference, obviously, but the writing in general seems rather short and abrupt. Not a lot of exposition or descriptions. Yes, we're all familiar with the story, and its characters, but a little more exposition wouldn't hurt here. Of course, I could be wrong. **Or Voldemort**. Who knows?
