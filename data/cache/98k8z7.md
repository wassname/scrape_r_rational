## Any rwby rational fics?

### Post:

Are there any rational rwby fics which are neither crossovers nor abandoned?

I remember the one where Jaun had a different semblance which was really good, but that hasn't had an update posted on here in a long time.

Thanks!

  [Reiteration](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11132119/1/Reiteration) is the closest one I can think of. It's pretty solidly handled for a self insert, though it stirs pretty quickly away from canon.

    Decent writing, but the author falls constant prey to the fact that it's a self-insert. At one point he tries to rectify this and grow his character, but the crux of it is that the main character is a stagnant cynic who is always self-justified, and up against strawmen.

  I like a lot the ongoing fic [Relic of the Future](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12863738/1/Relic-of-the-Future) by Coeur Al'Aran. It feels the most rational of all the fics he has written, and the plot is different from the show, as Jaune goes back in time and encounters younger versions of team RWBY and others.

  /u/jello_raptor and I have spent... let's say, a *while* trying to put together a Bleach/RWBY crossover world. Maybe someday we'll actually set stories there TT_TT

  [The Games We Play](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12119784/1/The-Games-We-Play-By-Ryuugi), perhaps? Some people on here seem to like it.

    Anti-recommendation as a rationalist fic - the main character doesn't pursue his goals so much as go with the flow and follow along with other peoples', the "munchinkry" is just him being given an obviously broken power and doing the bare minimum with it, the lack of enemies at his level that can give him a challenge leads to a constantly, absurdly increasing power level for enemies even past the usual for Gamer fics, and it kind of rambles on for a while before it gets to a point where the plot becomes interesting.

    It's nice as a light-novel style power fantasy, and the worldbuilding is decent, but it's not great as a ratfic.

      > doing the bare minimum with it

      What options did you find the main character to miss to utilise for munchkining his powers?

        Luck was introduced but it was then literally never used after some gambling IIRC. :D Readers joke about it all the time.

        I did really like the story, but I had been devouring some gamerfics.
        ```

        - u/NewDarkAgesAhead:
          ```
          I think the author had explained that the character didnâ€™t want to risk making events around him too unpredictable through luck increase.

          p.s. What other stories could you recommend?
          ```

          - u/kaukamieli:
            ```
            Yea but my point was that the whole thing shouldn't have had luck from the beginning and it was introduced, used, and then just discarded without MC doing anything with it. Even if it has a good explanation.

            I'd recommend Worth the Candle obviously. :D I don't think there is anything better.

            I just saw some skeleton soldier manga that I liked because it used a time loop.

            Fanfic.org has a section for "video game plot": https://www.fanfiction.net/community/The-Video-Game-Plot/105176/

            There was some fun story about someone rebirthing as spider in some dungeon.

            Chinese wuxian stories feel a lot like gamerfics in a way. But all I've read feel too similar to each other.

      I remember the spelling being horrible. Distractingly bad, not just the occasional minor typo.

    ```
    As much as i liked it, i gotta say it shouldn't be recommended as neither Rational nor a Rationalist fic.
    ```

  RWBY has a bit of a cult following, and a decent sized fanfiction community, but I don't think the type of people who like it are the type to like rational fiction. Add to that the difficulty of figuring out how to mesh whatever ends up being canon in the future into it, when the whole story hasn't been released, means that the process is much harder. Sure, you could make it up yourself, but that would destroy some of the point of writing a fan work, wouldn't  it? It's different from Harry Potter or Naruto, while also being different from the other fandoms we have works for here in that it's not quite obscure enough that writing fanfiction for it alone is unique.

  So no.

    I resent that notion. ;)

    Anecdotal, self selecting evidence, but I liked it quite a lot and I don't think I'm very atypical for this subreddit.

      You're considering the probabilities wrong. I'm saying P(rational|RWBY) is small, you're saying that P(RWBY|rational) is large. Whether or not you're right about people on /r/rational being RWBY fans, we still can't predict whether RWBY fans are prone to browsing /r/rational. (Which I have a strong prior against due to habit; not many people in *general* are prone to browsing /r/rational.)
      ```

      - u/Sailor_Vulcan:
        ```
        P(rational|Any fandom whatsoever) is small. However, your original point was about probability of liking rwby given liking rational fic, not the other way around. The probability of any randomly selected rwby fan liking rational fic is entirely irrelevant. Rational fic probably has a smaller readership than the entire rwby fanbase. So liking rwby is not even weak evidence that one isn't into rational fic. You're doing the equivalent of saying "people who like apples are less likely to like microwavable sauerkraut." As far as I know almost no one likes microwavable sauerkraut, that's not something particular to apple eaters. The smell is repugnant. Better to get it fresh and cook it some other way.

          Hahahaha, good point.

    I realize it's anectdotal, but I also like RWBY and ratfic.

  I'm the author of the different semblance fic--it is proceeding, though slowly.

  Not entirely rational, and it's a crossover with the Gamer, but [The Name of the Game](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11826167/1/The-Name-of-the-Game) by Literalsin might scratch that RWBY itch.
  ```

  - u/Sailor_Vulcan:
    ```
    Huh. So there are TWO RWBY/the Gamer crossover fics?
