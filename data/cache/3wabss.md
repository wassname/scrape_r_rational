## Writing a Grimoire - Chapter 4

_There were two things I really enjoyed about HPMOR; 1) Harry trying to figure out the underlying rules of magic and 2) reading all the comments when new chapters were posted. Now I've got a magical system and a story to tell, so I'm aiming at recreating those two things._

_Since posting chapter 3, I've posted  [Chapter 0](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3vatzy/writing_a_grimoire_chapter_0/) to provide some much needed context. I've also edited the other chapters for clarity, and added a [crude sketch of the pentagram]( http://i.imgur.com/qFnQHAE.jpg). Given how short the story is, I recommend reading it from the [start](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3vatzy/writing_a_grimoire_chapter_0/)._

_I've also realised that 1) I don't know enough physics to keep this story accurate if the characters perform well designed experiments and that 2) having a bunch of characters just measure stuff is probably not the most engaging literature anyway._

_Therefore the next chapter will feature the most upvoted **hypothesis**, but you are of course highly encouraged to design an experiment that could show your hypothesis to be wrong._

Daniel and Emma had gone to the workshop to try to find out exactly how solid the sheets of paper were, leaving Matt and Tom to find out how cold the papers were. 

Matt had started off with the assumption that the paper would heat back up to room temperature, and when that never happened had taken increasingly drastic measures to attempt to heat the paper _at all_. Now they've ended up at the student kitchen, thankfully devoid of any students, where the paper was placed inside the oven which were set to its maximum temperature.

"I don't really get why you seem so freak out about this", Tom said, while helping himself to an apple. "Do you think I could place a sheet of paper like that inside my computer? The fans are seriously noisy."

Matt contemplated this for a moment, and the answer was yes, you probably could use these sheets of paper as cooling devices instead of fans. You just had to be careful that the papers didn't cool down the computer chips so much that any condensation could occur, because that could cause a short circuit. But then again, if the papers were as cold as he suspected, the potential applications went way beyond replacing mere fans. He almost started formulating this into a response before his sense of Physics wrestled control of his mind from his sense of Engineering.

"Have you not heard of law of conservation of energy!? The first law of thermodynamics? That energy cannot be created or destroyed?" Matt exclaimed. Actually he knew very well that Matt knew these things, they had the same physics classes.

"If we're not able to heat up that piece of paper, it means that it's destroying the universe!". Matt could not help but sound a bit panicked. 

Tom merely raised his eyebrowes. "That sounds _a tad_ hyperbolic", he said, and took another bite of his apple.

And in a way, Matt knew that Tom was right, the piece of paper in the oven would not cause the heat death of the universe on any kind of time frame that he cared about. Still, this was the most unnerving experience of his life. It was impossible.

Matt got up, opened the oven and stuck his hand in, hovering over the paper. He could feel the heat from the grill and the cold from the paper. Impossible. 

Matt slammed the oven shut, and Tom barely managed to camuflage his chuckle as a cough. 

They sat in silence, Matt in quiet contemplation and Tom eating his apple, until Emma and Daniel entered the kitchen.

"How did it go?", Emma asked as she and Daniel took seat at the kitchen table. Matt didn't say anything but simply got up, moved over to the oven and took out the piece of paper using oven mitts. 

"Still cold as it was since it was first drawn", he said, and demonstrably placed the paper at table. 

"But how cold?", Daniel asked.

"No clue, I couldn't find a thermometer", Matt replied. And before anyone could ask what he was doing or protest, he took a pencil and drew a line through the middle triangle of the pentagram, causing the paper to become hard instead of cold.

Emma made an almost invisible nod. "You will be happy to learn that the paper is not indestructable. Daniel was able to bend it using a bench vise and some pliers. Actually you can see the marks from the vise on the paper." she said, while placed the bent paper on the table. It was bent exactly as you would expect a normal A4 paper to be bend.

"How much force did it take?", Tom asked.

"Difficult to tell, I didn't actually measure anything, I just pulled as hard as I could with the pliers", Daniel replied. "I'm not sure how to describe it, it felt like the paper resisted being bent no matter how force I used. Look..."

Daniel got up and found to cooking books, about an inch thick and placed them on the floor. Then he took the now no longer cold paper and placed it between the two books so that it formed a sort of bridge. And then he stood on it, balancing on one foot.

The paper bent _slowly_, under the full weight of Daniel it took about half a minute until the paper touched the floor.

"So now what do we do?", Emma asked.

  Hypothesis: before drawing the line, the molecules of the paper are slowed down, which causes the paper to appear cold.
  After drawing the line, this property becomes macroscopical and the paper itself is slowed down in time, which gives the impression that it's hard.
  So both modifications observed so far are related to time manipulation.

  How does this sound? Any way to test it?

    This doesn't quite explain the cold: slowing down the molecules *once* would cool down the paper once, but forcing the molecules to stay slow will also prevent it from absorbing any more heat than usual, so if the molecules stay slow it won't feel cold. In fact, slowing down the molecules seems like a great hypothesis for what's going on with the hardened paper. The only trouble with *that* is that it's still easy to rotate the paper or accelerate it, it's just hard to bend it.

    If we look on the scale of the molecules, making them cold would be like adding an opposing force to them that is constant (like dragging a box) or that opposes the velocity (like air resistance), while making them slow would be like adding an opposing force to them that *opposes other forces*.

    I'd draw most of the diagram, set a corner of the paper on fire, and finish the diagram.

    If the paper keeps burning (albeit very, very slowly) we've got good evidence that the paper is being macroscopically slowed, as opposed to just frozen.

    The paper going out is a less clear signal; it only rules out some of the ways that "slowing the molecules" could work.

  They don't _know_ it's destroying energy... it could be radiating it as neutrinos or polarized gravity waves ^((spot the reference)^) or something, and any temperature gradient can be used to do useful work. A chunk of cold could keep you warm well into the future.

  What to do?

  Go back to Tom's original idea, and draw stuff in different orders. At arms length.

  See if you can sketch it with a flatbed plotter, if you can find one any more.

  Or try a 3d printer.

  Hypothesis?

  1. The whole world is a simulation and this pattern is a backdoor.

  2. There's a supercomputer that's the Source of Magic somewhere, and it scans the stellar neighborhood for instances of the pattern. (eg, Ra or Scott Meyer's _Off to be the Wizard_)

    This is a good opportunity to discuss philosophy of science, which is my main motivation to write this story. If I were a better writer I would be able to embed this directly into the story.

    What you first suggest is to experiment with how the pentagrams are drawn, by changing the order they are drawn or using something other than pen and paper. But you never say anything about what result you expect from these changes. 

    That expectation would be your hypothesis, for example: If the pentagram is drawn starting from the outside circle and inward, the paper will be cold. If the pentagram is drawn starting with the inner triangle and outward, the paper will be warm. 

    The characters can draw the pentagram in different ways and test this, which makes the hypothesis (or theory, if you want) [_falsifiable_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability).

    This is in contrast to you two last hypothesis, that the the world is a simulation or that the source of magic is a supercomputer. There is no experiment our characters can currently perform that will show these hypothesis false (that I can come up with!), and thus these hypothesis cannot be considered to be scientific. And more importantly for me: it does nothing to drive the plot of the story forward.

    Of course, if the way the pentagrams work are directly connected to the _Ultimate Truth of the Universe_, there may be a way forward here, but I'm keeping [Metaphysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysics) for the last Arc.

      > But you never say anything about what result you expect from these changes. 

      There isn't nearly enough information to make that decision. They only have two data points, and they're qualitatively rather than quantitatively different. Right now the only thing they can *scientifically* do is get more data points. And the best way to do that is to try changing the things that have already made a difference.

      There is also not nearly enough information to form a hypothesis of what's causing this. It's way premature to start hypothesizing.

      > There is no experiment our characters can currently perform that will show these hypothesis false (that I can come up with!)

      You can attempt to distinguish between them by performing the tests in physically different locations. If the source of magic is a scanner in a specific location, it should be possible to triangulate on it by examining the strength of the effect in different places.

      If you believe magic has existed throughout history and your roommate was able to get a hold of it then that implies that magic is available to at least some people but something is stopping it from spreading and that experimenting with or using it enough will end up with that something happening to you. 

      If you believe magic is only a recent occurrence and your roommate was able to access it then either your roommate had access to god like powers at some point and made the world the way it is (world is a simluation) or you are being screwed with by some other higher order being. 

      In the first case leaving runes lying around will likely lead to some horrible consequence like a masquerade kill team detecting and tracking the source of the magic to your house if you use cool charms in your fridge to save on electricity for example.

  Next order of business is to figure out if the pentagram can be disabled. We want to know before hand how to disable the paper (in case of fire gram, black-hole gram, or up quarks gram)  
   Hypothesis: scribbling a part of the outer circle disables the pentagram.



  Obviously the way forward is to not mess with adding more combinations to our knowledge base. If all we know already presents us with danger (metal papercuts and cold burns) I don't think any other grams we discover would nesiccarially be safe.


  On the topic of new grams we could discover, hard and cold grams seem to follow a pattern of "elemental" effects, they also all seem to have utility. I'd hypothesise that future grams could be: the hot gram, anti-grav gram, ghost gram, explosion gram, alpha/beta/gamma radiation gram.


  Furthermore, if we can't tell anyone about the grams or utilize the grams to better human society, I don't really see the point of enquiring further into them. Curiosity is not worth the potential risks of finding a very dangerous garm.

  If we *are* going to do new gram testing, it should be done in an empty room, or deserted place outside, and drawn with a [turtle robot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_(robot)). I'm worried that the explosion gram will take someone's hand off.



  What do you guys think?
