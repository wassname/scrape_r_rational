  For a more comprehensive and less convoluted taxonomy, I recommend [this post by qntm](https://qntm.org/models). Qntm is the author of Ra and Fine Structure.

      I recommend [all of](https://qntm.org/time) qntm's time-travel related posts. There are posts considering the specific time-travel models utilized in Primer, Looper, 12 Monkeys, Bill & Ted, Back to the Future, About Time, Dr. Who, and the computer game Braid, discussing in detail both the models' mechanics as well as their literary features.

  This episode was recorded prior to me seeing the new show "Timeless", so here's some griping about that:

  The premise is that they're trying to stop a criminal from making changes to the past. They know the time and place that he time travels to and have to follow him to prevent him from changing history. This, at least, makes some sense and is one of the boilerplate forms of time travel. In the pilot episode they find that the bad guy has prevented the Hindenburg from exploding; by the end of the episode, the Hindenburg explodes under different circumstances, and the team goes back to the future ... where the home team thinks that nothing at all has changed. All historical documents reflect the changes that have been made to history, all home team memories have been altered, and only the away team remembers things differently.

  That's all more or less fine. The Hindenburg explodes at night due to some terrorists rather than during the day due to some malfunction, but [In Spite of a Nail](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InSpiteOfANail) is a well-worn trope that I don't have *too* much of a problem with in that it greases the wheels of the story (as discussed this episode).

  But what comes next is that at least one of the characters finds their life *completely* different, and the home team expresses disbelief at this fact, going so far as to say that *of course* you never had a sister, what are you talking about, we have a dossier that would have mentioned her.

  This is braindead! They know that history changes, they know that they won't remember how it originally was, yet they deny changes that they'd have no evidence against, and they make no effort to keep a log of history beyond what the away team can remember. Worse, their entire rationale for bringing a historian along is that she'll know enough about the past to successfully navigate it ... but with every time they go back into the past, the future they return to gets further and further from the one they originally knew, and the cascade of changes alters the pasts they they'll keep going to. Changing the when/how of the Hindenburg doesn't completely change American history in the show, but there are clear effects. Go back to 1937, then go to the changed future, then go back to 1962 without doing your research, and how can you know that your information is any good?

  Needless to say, I think this is probably a pretty good canon for making some rational fiction. A team tasked with keeping the past intact, or failing that preventing the end of American democracy, doomed to come back to lives they don't recognize, carrying with them records of histories which have been erased, useful only to see how badly they've bungled their missions.

    Yeah, that sounds like some pretty badly missed potential. I don't think I'd be able to watch more than one episode of characters that are so low-effort. If they were regular folk who stumbled upon Time Travel, sure, but an organization tasked and prepared for it that doesn't take some kind of safety measures like you suggested is about as immersion breaking as a firebreathing dragon showing up to torch the Hindenburg after they save it.

  Oh man, I'm really looking forward to the multiverse episode.  I think the multiverse concept is a huge well of untapped potential; I like it better than time travel, but I'm pretty sure it's less popular.  I wish the multiverse concept were used more for its own sake rather than as a patch to make sense of a time travel plot.  I have to give Rick And Morty a lot of credit for this, although I think that you could get a much more dramatic series out of the concept - particularly if you use different mechanics, although I don't think that that's necessary.  We need a *lot* more crosstime travel fiction.

  I had one neat idea for a premise-technology for a novel I never wrote; it was essentially a portal where, whenever you push the button, it splits the universe in two, and the portals in each universe connect to one another.  I have a hardline stance on timeline divergences: "for want of a nail" doesn't even cover it because the butterfly effect means that events microscopically change pseudorandom factors in other events in a way that spirals out of control, and the butterfly effect doesn't even cover it because quantum randomness means that events are actually random even with *no* external cause for change.  So, when the portal's opened, the universes on each side of it *immediately* diverge and there are essentially two different people on either side of it talking to each other.  With multiple such portals you can essentially create an infinite network of universes split off around the same time.

  Eventually, once the setting is already well-established, a time-traveling variant on the portal is introduced.  These portals, when their button is pressed, save the state of the universe and open up a portal to a copy of the last such saved state.  From the user's standpoint, it's a flip of the coin - you either open up a portal to the past (by being the original universe opening up the copy) or to the future (by being the copy opened up by the original).

  Unfortunately this multiverse gets pretty fucking doomed because over time, the probability of someone somewhere creating a self-replicating nanomachine apocalypse that propagates through portals increases and the very popular and useful "infinite-universe networks" are like dry forests for that shit.  The infinite-universe networks are more interesting the longer they go between resets, but also more hazardous because of the aforementioned "apocalypses capable of propagating through portals".

  Hey all, welcome back! This week we discuss the ways Time Travel manifests in fiction, and the various challenges and story space created by each.

  Reminder that there won't be an episode going up next week, and to stick around after the episode for /u/alexanderwales's book recommendation!

  Finally, if you have an itunes account and would like to leave us a review, it would be super appreciated :)

  Hope you enjoy the listen, and all feedback welcome!

  I remember this one formalization of the ripple effect that I thought of. I don't know if this is the place to share it?
