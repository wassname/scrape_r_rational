## Idea/request: Rational!Bruce Almighty

### Post:

I think that sort of premise is ideal for this subreddit, and could have been handled much better by the main character. Reminder: Bruce's omnipotence only applies to Buffalo, not to the whole world or universe.

What are your ideas/comments/feedback?

  Ah... What were the rules, and what were Bruce's goals? This seems way too overpowered to be interesting.
  ```

  - u/Chronophilia:
    ```
    Bruce wasn't allowed to tell anyone that he was God, and he couldn't interfere with free will. He also ended up surrendering his powers willingly, so it was never explained if there was a time limit or if God would have stepped in if he did anything really excessive.
    ```

  - u/The_Insane_Gamer:
    ```
    Very overpowered. I'm thinking a mostly remodeled character, sort of like HJPEV, just basically a rational!Bruce, not the same character. His restrictions: Cannot interfere with free will, omnipotence only applies within Buffalo, New York.
    ```

      > Cannot interfere with free will

      But...

      The universe is deterministic.

      *Everything* interferes with free will.

      Does this mean Bruce isn't allowed to *exis*-oh I see...

        Can't directly tamper with brains or mindstates. It worked for CelestAI, I'm sure it's a consistent rule.

      Well, the obvious answer would be to declare yourself the autonomous ruler of Buffalo, New York and declare the entire universe your domain.
      ```

      - u/The_Insane_Gamer:
        ```
        Yes, but how would he do that? His omnipotence still only applies to Buffalo
        ```

        - u/lsparrish:
          ```
          How is Buffalo defined? Legally? Would it be possible to expand it to encompass the entire state of New York, by convincing the right authorities to pass the right laws? How about including say an island on the other side of the world?

          Also, is this a three dimensional relationship? Can he carve a Buffalo shaped wedge to the center of the earth? How about creating a Buffalo shaped tower of infinite (or just very large) height?
          ```

          - u/The_Insane_Gamer:
            ```
            1: I'm assuming Buffalo would refer to the Buffalo-Niagara Falls Metropolitan Area

            2: The defined region would be Buffalo at the time the powers were given, not Buffalo as it is at the time.

            3: Arbitrary restrictions: Only the troposphere above Buffalo would count as Buffalo, not the stratosphere and above. The powers would not extend below the crust of the earth.
            ```

    I think we can assume that God limits him to Buffalo hard. Let's pretend the meteor and pull-the-moon scene were faked by God (parallel universe?). No science-breakthrough-spread-to-the-world either. No "affect free will", but body modification works. Cannot reveal your power (although that was not a hard rule in the movie).

    Bruce is quite selfish. The movie is his journey to a more altruistic person. Probably not going to happen with rational!Bruce.

    Goals:

      * have a relationship with Grace
      * be successful at work / revenge on Evan
      * (later) be not be bothered by prayers

  Here's the copout answer:  Create Friendly AI

  Some less cheap ones:

  * Use omnipotence to find saintly people.  Give them omnipotence that isn't limited to Buffalo
  * Create safe, un-abusable general-constructor nanotech
  * Build a beanstalk to geosynch
  * Create the blueprints and all required scientific documentation for arbitrarily advanced technology, plus all the tech that would be necessary to achieve it.  It would take a long time for people to master all of it and make use of it, but it shouldn't be more than a generation or three.  By the end of that time humanity would effectively be gods through the power of science.
  * Create full documentation on psychological / scientific methods of modifying the brain, but only to turn it into a brilliant, sane person.  Make available.

    A what, sorry?

    - u/eaglejarl:
      ```
      Also known as [a space elevator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_elevator).  A beanstalk is one form of space elevator--IIRC, it was the first one anyone thought of.  Gravity whips and ring fountains are a couple of other types.
      ```

  - u/GopherAtl:
    ```
    aah, but *could* you create a friendly AI in those constraints? Or does a sufficiently intelligent creation qualify as having free will you're then not allowed to interfere with? If nothing else it seems like a reasonable device to assume "has free will" is an *added* constraint for any human-or-better level intelligent mind.
    ```

    - u/The_Insane_Gamer:
      ```
      Creating the AI as friendly would not count as interfering with its brain state, or "free will". Once the AI is activated, then Bruce couldn't do anything to its "brain"

    Create a magic item that grants you omnipotence that isn't limited to Buffalo. Then you don't have to trust other people.

  In order to tell you this story, I have to tell you another story first.

  It's called *Precisely Bound Demons and their Behaviour*.
  ```

  All the responses I've seen seem to be approaching this from the premise of "assume Perfectly Rational Being also becomes Omnipotent and Omnicient" and, even with the given constraints, that just sounds like a recipe for a rational circle-jerk, not an interesting or meaningful story. 

  For this premise to work, I think, you have to start with a flawed rationalist who, over the course of experimenting with his powers, discovers the flaws in himself. One possibility that jumps to mind, there is a, ah... *slight* tendency for *certain* rationalists to be a bit ... condescending, to anyone they perceive as less rational than themselves. So the character might start out focused entirely on trying to find ways to apply their omnipotence without violating free will, and largely overlook the full applications of omniscience as applied to people, namely, fully understanding others, what they want and why they want it, the full story of who they are and how they think and feel, both as subjective personal experience and objective truth. 

  Of course, there is also the little fact that this presumably-initially-atheist rationalist is confronted with a literal God, and presumably immortal souls and some sort of afterlife to go with it. It might well take him time to fully absorb this new information into his world view, and change his perception of life on earth which, in such a scenario, would in fact be a brief juvenile stage of life for an immortal being.

  eh, bottom line, I can imagine good stories coming out of this premise, but I can imagine a lot more terrible and pointless ones.

  - u/The_Insane_Gamer:

    Well, the entire idea was supposed to be kind of circlejerky in the first place, the space limitation in my opinion would make it more challenging and therefore interesting. If you don't like the idea, you don't have to read any of the stories that would hypothetically result from this. Thank you for your input though.

  In the movie there was a scene where he pulls the Moon out of its orbit, which leads to flooding elsewhere in the world according to the news. So we'd have to go with the [hypothesis](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WMG/BruceAlmighty) that news reports are fake / people's memories are being edited.
  ```

- u/DCarrier:
  ```
  [Fun theory](http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Fun_theory) seems relevant. Utopia is easier said than done, even for an omnipotent god.

  He'd need to expand control outside Buffalo. A utopia that tiny hardly matters at all. He could easily send jets full of supplies to the rest of the world, but there's a lot of stuff that needs to be done outside Buffalo.

  Once you get to interplanetary stuff, omnipotence on an Earth city won't count for much. It will give him an edge for material science research. He could start a lab to research cheaper and more effective solar panels, to start work on a Dyson sphere. He could produce large amounts of them from just that city, but eventually he'll need to use what he has to start mining all the planets to build more. Then he'll need to work on starships to build Dyson spheres around other stars.

    Google says Buffalo is 136 km^2.  Let's say that each person needs 1000 square feet of space to not feel crowded (ignore things like roads, hallways, and infrastructure.  This utopia has teleportation and other magic.).  That's 10k people per square kilometer, or 1.4 million people in 136 km^2..  

    Next, make the living spaces 10 feet high and stack them one on top of the other.  Let's say that you get 1000 layers before you leave "Buffalo" at 10 000 feet up.  That gives you enough space for about 1.4 billion people or ~20% of the world's population without needing to do anything too strange with the powers.
    ```

    - u/DCarrier:
      ```
      20% of the current population. You don't want to stop there, do you?

      "without needing to do anything too strange with the powers." Doing strange things is the point. You have to figure out how to get as much as possible out of your powers, not just settle for the best you can do without doing anything hard.
      ```

      - u/ulyssessword:
        ```
        Nah, but that does give a better starting point.
        ```

      - u/lsparrish:
        ```
        He could make a magic item that increases the interior size of a room to ten times it's original size in all three dimensions, with the result of 1000x the volume. Mass produce these. Set a limit on e.g the number of times it can be applied recursively to the same area to some safe number so people don't go creating solar system sized rooms that suck the air out of the world.
        ```

        - u/DCarrier:
          ```
          If he's allowed to alter geometry like that, then he can cheat a lot more. He can completely fill any volume with air, and ignore any gravitational effects this would have.

          He could remove a point from Buffalo and warp the universe around it to grow it to infinite size, resulting in a wormhole to another universe that technically is inside of Buffalo. But it gets better. He doesn't have to stick to Euclidean geometry, and he can make the second universe have hyperbolic geometry instead. Locally, it behaves similar to Euclidean geometry, so small objects would work fine. However, on a large scale, the volume of a ball increases exponentially with the radius. If he gives everyone an [ideal triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_triangle) to live on, he could fit everyone in the world within 31 triangles of the center.

          I'd rule that that's too overpowered, and he can't increase the volume of Buffalo.
          ```

          - u/lsparrish:
            ```
            Well, if we rule out Tardis-like geometry of "bigger on the inside", he could perhaps instead create devices that physically shrink people so they will fit in very tiny buildings. Inside the buildings there could be a device which teleports you safely outside and increases your size back to normal.

            Assuming he specifies it, yes. But assuming he's giving out holy objects / magic wands that enable the bearer to do this to any room, he has to think of the precise functioning in advance. Otherwise he's letting the power do whatever it wants with the situation, which is a Bad Thing.

            Moreover, let's bear in mind that a solar system sized volume of air has substantial mass -- more than our sun, for example. Packing that within a small room could result in some rather extraordinary gravitational effects.

            Density of air at sea level = 1.225 kg/m^3  
            Mass of the sun = 1.989E30 kg  
            Volume of one cubic AU (radius of the earth's orbit) = 3.347929E33 m^3

            For rough back of envelope purposes, we're talking 4000x the mass of the sun per cubic AU. If we were to look at something the size of the orbit of Pluto, it would be many of orders of magnitude greater.

  I'd make my domain run on rules closer to D&D than our reality, albeit with quality of life improvements. Think Two-Year Emperor with a few decades of advancement. I want a world that can operate without my constant interference.

  You just turned 18? Time to go to the neighborhood FLEA and get to level 60.

  Do you need a place to stay for the night? Cast Mage's Magnificent Mansion.

  Want food on the go, rather than going into a Magnificent Mansion? Use Create Food and Drink, which in my version produces reasonably tasty food (about as good as you could prepare with decent ingredients and tools).

  Want something more permanent? Create a demiplane (which, due to constraints, may be located in a non-Euclidean subspace in a protected pocket deep in the bowels of Buffalo). And my version of the Genesis spell even conjures a piece of forked metal suitable for teleporting into the plane you just created, so you don't have to wander interplanar space for weeks to find the world you just made.

  Feeling a touch under the weather? Cast Cure Disease on yourself.

  Dislike your appearance? Cast Polymorph Any Object on yourself. You can do it if you want to change your eye color, weight, apparent gender, tattoos...

  [Seen something? Said nothing? Tried and failed to drink to forget?](http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/587/768/c7b.jpg) Have a trusted friend mindscrape you to remove the problematic memory.

  Not enough time during the day to do what you need to? Grab a Ring of Sustenance, or perhaps an Ice Assistant, the demilitarized version of Ice Assassin.

  One large problem to solve is identity tracking. If I can PAO myself to look like Nicholas Cage, how do you tell me from Nicholas Cage?

  Another problem is law enforcement. What laws can you enforce on a population of level 60 wizard/sorcerer/archivists? Even if most of the dangerous spells are removed, it would be easy to escape into a private demiplane.

  ----

  That's the standard and style of living I'm looking for. Non-Euclidean geometry to fit a large and growing population, universally available magic to give people their own lives, not dependent on my continued existence or one extremely powerful entity, that are still appreciably better than current reality.

  Now there's the problem of relocating seven billion people to Buffalo, NY.

  1. Create a demiplane that will fit the entire earth.
  2. Create a fleet of utility airships -- invisible, permeable to matter, etc. Position them around the planet.
  3. Have them duplicate all the non-human bits of the planet into the giant demiplane (except for the region within Buffalo that contains the demiplanes).
  4. Have them teleport all humans into the corresponding positions in the giant demiplane on the cloned Earth.
  5. Have them erase all hazardous materials from the surface of the earth and otherwise make it safe. No reason to leave trash around; keep the old Earth as a nature preserve.

  Now the whole population of Earth is inside the Buffalo region, the old Earth isn't going to explode or melt down, and the new Earth is available for me to alter as necessary.

  If that sort of power projection isn't possible, then I use my powers within Buffalo to create a giant airport and fleet of airships bringing anyone who wishes to Buffalo, free of charge. Perfectly normal airships, no divine power to keep them afloat or make them operate. I use my divine power to multitask enough to pilot them all, and I use divinely created satellites to communicate with them so I can pilot them remotely.

  (Why airships rather than airplanes? Because they're more awesome. And I can land them with fewer facilities than an airplane.)

  And if governments started imprisoning their populations, I'd have to deploy divinely created techno-kidnappers. Remove the problematic officials and bring them into my domain so I can give them a high quality life just like everyone else. It's kinder than assassination.

  Everyone here is forgetting that God can fold space, and *does*, inside that white building.

  But ... my main concern would be less "the affecting of all things possible", and more worried about whether this "God" guy I'm talking to is effectively a Friendly AI. Why exactly do I have these powers? Is God omniscient? Has he planned this all out in advance? What are his goals, and what will he allow me to do?
