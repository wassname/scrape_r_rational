  This chapter is dedicated to everyone who has ever learned something the hard way in the lab.

  A full explanation of what happened will be in the next chapter--it doesn't involve any new physics, just a few minor tweaks to stuff that is already understood.

      Learning has occured!

        Indeed!  And we get to see why Learning (the ship) is so handy to have around--as well as why he is such a headache for his nominal superiors.  He's an electronic warfare ship AI--being a trickster is part of his job.

      Yeah, Flicker would have insisted on moving the tests back to a planet as soon as they were sure they wouldn't blow it up, except the portal needed to be in both vacuum and freefall.
