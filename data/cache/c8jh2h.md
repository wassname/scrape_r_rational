  >Torture of Callowan prisoners

  rip the Blood. You'd think the Pilgrim would've kept them from doing that.

  Also,

  >these ‘sharpers’ were both commonly used and in large supply

  Reference to the deal they made with the Matrons. Must've been a pretty significant amount of gold.

    He never got around to actually formalizing those agreements that he was talking about previously, as far as i can remember. Also i think it was mostly with the Proceran forces that he was attached to previously where as these are Dominon forces.
    ```

    - u/Academic_Jellyfish:
      ```
      Even so, he hates torture and knows Cat would get really pissed if/when she finds out

      Edit: Here we go,

      >“There are evils I have been forced to make peace with,” the Pilgrim said with iron in his voice. “Torture is not one of them. You may be certain I will allow no such thing so long as I draw breath

      He must not have been told.
      ```

      - u/anenymouse:
        ```
        i mean i agree with you but the way things look Yannu might have been keeping it quiet, Pilgrim might not have known cause the information was kept from him.

        Edit what chapter was that by the way? i can't recall if he's speaking for the Grand Alliance or only in his advisory position to the Proceran forces.
        ```

          Kinda weak defense for the guy who has angels peek into other peoples minds for him all the time.
          ```

          - u/LordSwedish:
            ```
            It could have happened after the band of heroes left. Some Levant commanders noticing that the Peregrine is gone and that they need information regarding the Callowans...
            ```

            - u/Mountebank:
              ```
              Would be even more apropos if it happened after Pilgrim gave up his crown. That's a very narrow window of time, but time is a very flexible in Arcadia.
              ```

          - u/ATRDCI:
            ```
            Mercy only tells.him about where he's needed.  And the need for him in then and of five was much greater than the need for him safeguarding prisoners
            ```

            - u/AntiChri5:
              ```
              He regularly has his little friends peek into people's minds, for use as a lie detector. Did it with Cat in their first meeting and Vivienne at the Battle of The Camps. Someone who does that doesn't get to play the ignorance card later on.
              ```

  - u/RRTCorner:
    ```
    I would not be surprised if this just turns out that EE made an actual mistake. Even though the sheer quantity and quality of the output seems superhuman I very much doubt that there will never be mistakes of this type.
    ```

- u/anenymouse:
  ```
  Goddamnit Cat what is that timing? I mean yeah it would have been bad if the Grand Alliance was sundered, but you've been offering to go as far as possible for Cordelia for the last two books, it's only karma for her to suffer from her past decisions. Also love the chain of misunderstandings and how Hakram was this close to using it all as leverage for one of Cat's major goals. Also that Rozala saw that there were larger consequences but that she's already been ordered to back Cat to the hilt.
  ```

  - u/LordSwedish:
    ```
    To be fair, the Levatines just got pretty close to letting Callow into the alliance, and now here comes Cat with a resurrected Pilgrim.
    ```

    - u/ATRDCI:
      ```
      In between Tariq supporting her bid in Levsnt and Cordelia going full Roman dictator in Salia, Get basically has just about all the support she needs already
      ```

      - u/Academic_Jellyfish:
        ```
        We don't know if Tariq's going to support her bid. He might though: his main concern in not was keeping the Grand Alliance from being destroyed over it. Cordelia's taken full control over Procer (not that he knows, but the Ophanim might tell him), and Levant's amenable since Cat resurrected Pilgrim. Ashur's a concern, but they've been made irrelevant for a generation, with the fleet being destroyed and Assassin wiping out the third tier. They're definitely in a good position to push to join.
        ```

- u/synonimic:
  ```
  So, everyone's assuming it's Cat and Pilgrim, did I miss the part where Archer, Rogue Sorcerer, and Hierophant had already made their way back?  If I'm remembering correctly Cat said that she'd be a while longer as everyone else headed back, but I don't remember them being announced as having returned.  Same with tyrant, though he was crawling last he was described so I doubt he caught up with anyone.

  It'd be weird for two people to return, and the way it's written
  >Princess of Aequitan felt the world change

  would make you assume it's Cat and Pilgrim, but it could also be a 'world changing' event if it's say Archer and Hierophant, since visions of Archer dying were seen, or if it ends up Tyrant and one of the others due to some honest trickery.

  It's a stretch, but Tyrant tends to make stretches much more likely when he's involved.
  ```

  - u/Jarwain:
    ```
    They're aware that Archer was resurrected.

    I think Tyrant already made it out and his forces were observed to be retreatinf

    I think the main points for it being Cat are:

    - that they arrive at dawn
    - two figures hobbling in
    - narrative weight being with Cat and Pilgrim, especially in this moment. It being Archer and Rogue would be anticlimactic. Masego was already whisked away by Ivah IIRC
    ```

    - u/Baljar:
      ```
      Also Hakram was drawn to that spot by her approach.
      ```
