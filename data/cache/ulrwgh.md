## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  I recently read Paranoid Mage and really enjoyed the MC's abilities. Does anyone know any good books with MC's with interesting and abusable abilities? Especially like time/space abilities like Paranoid Mage / Perfect Run
  ```

  - u/Nick_named_Nick:
    ```
    This could very easily be a me problem, but I have DNF both Kairos (only read book 1) and Perfect Run. I *think* I got further into Perfect Run. I remember >!the statue/breakfast/I-Just-Banged-Your-Daughter scene.!< and also >!he JUST solves the “no memories of dead timelines” thing for his sister/love interest who is a water tinker.!<. I also remember >!the bit where he convinces some really strong Brute that he’s the president to assume control!<. Do we ever figure out who >!Cauldron!< is? That passed out vials? Or what dimensional fuckery sources powers? 


    Anyways I think his other work is actually what he’s most known for/what blew him up on RR? I have not finished either of his works I have tried though. And that’s the end of my rambling.

      Yeah Perfect Run got wrapped up nicely about 150 pages after you left off. Author actually had a plan and finished the story with good pacing.

  I second u/followelectricsheep's [recommendation](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/u18fez/comment/i4iets2/) for [The Victors Project](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9966888/1/The-Victors-Project).  It's one chapter covering some untold story of every past Hunger Games victor.  It's fantastically written - even when it feels like it might get repetitive and stale, it manages to feel fresh.  I don't recommend binge-reading this like I did though, it starts to weigh on you by the end.

  I *highly* recommend reading this while listening to [Achilles, Come Down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5aMav6q-o0) by Gang of Youths, because it captures the atmosphere brilliantly to me (and is also an amazing song in general, I can't believe I hadn't heard it before).
  ```

  - u/lillarty:
    ```
    Are there people capable of reading while listening to music with vocals? The song is nice, but I can hardly focus on writing this post while listening to it, so I can't imagine I'd be absorbing any of the text if I tried to read while it was playing. 

    Is this one of those situations like aphantasia, where I'm erroneously generalizing my own experiences onto everyone else because I had never considered that others would experience it differently?
    ```

    - u/jozdien:
      ```
      Whenever I listen to any music, it's always background filler for me - like even if I'm doing nothing else, the vocals just pass by me without my really thinking about them.  So it might just be how I listen to music, yeah.
      ```

    - u/flame7926:
      ```
      I mostly read while listening to music with lyrics - later if i go back and listen to the album again it takes me back to what i was reading in a nice way
      ```

    - u/Revlar:
      ```
      It's a focus thing. It's definitely pretty universal to be unable to parse two sources of language at once. Can't read a book and listen to a podcast and get double learning, because one of them will become background.

      But if you've already heard the song before and aren't trying to decipher the vocals (or can't because it's a language you don't know) the text just takes priority and there's no issue. If this isn't your experience, you may want to get that checked out with a neurologist.
      ```

  - u/followelectricsheep:
    ```
    The song is pretty cool! I like the vibes. Yeah, TVP can get really fucking heavy at times, even when not talking about the gladitatorial death matches.>!Maeve's chapter was particularly awful.!<

    While I'm here, I'm going to shill for [Fixed to a Star](https://archiveofourown.org/works/655081/chapters/1193523) again, because it wasn't very good last time. If you found the District 1 and 2 chapters in TVP engaging, or liked the Enobaria fic by the same author, I highly recommend you read this.

    It takes place during the games that Katniss mentioned where every tribute reaped was twelve. District 2's male career tribute knows that the only way to win these strange games is to not seem like a villain, and that's kind of hard in a normal year where you're slaughtering a bunch of kids, but this time it's just twelve-year-olds. 

    It plays with the audience aspect of the Games a lot. Quote from the author's notes:

    >My personal headcanon is that you can be murderer and victim both, and that this dichotomy is what makes the Careers so fascinating. This story is an exploration of that.
    ```

      ```
      Oh boy, I'm going to dump a lot here because your ask is broad enough.

      Some of these are similar in style to Achilles, Come Down and which I liked, and some of these are just ones I liked enough to also listen to semi-obsessively at one point or another, in no order whatsoever.

  If there’s anything you could recommend, but you haven’t before cause it didn’t ever fit, what would it be? I recently cleared out all of my to be read, so I’m looking for new stuff. 


  If I had to give one out, for web fiction I would say: [Ultra A. I. ](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/28111/ultra-ai)

  For published books: [Against A Dark Background](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/422452.Against_a_Dark_Background)

    ```
    [Witch Creek Road](https://m.webtoons.com/en/horror/witch-creek-road/list?title_no=1453&page=1)

    It's a webtoon that starts off like Cabin in the Woods and ends up like The Magnus Archives. 

    King of the Goblins by William Bradshaw. Reads like a more modern Discworld. Isn't as good as Discworld but it's Sufficiently enjoyable that I have no compunctions recommending it to anyone that likes fantasy satire.

    Roadside Picnic by the Strugatskys. An excellent First Encounter book published in the Cold War Era. Highly recommend.

    The Legend of Eli Monpress by Rachel Aaron. I've only read the first two of the series but the best way I can describe it is imagine if Kelsier was less psychotically murderous and more whimsical and free spirited like the gang originally thinks he is. Magic is not a hard magic system like in Mistborn.

    And finally, Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy by David D Burns. I would not recommend this as a replacement for therapy but I reread it multiple times a year and it helps me center my self emotionally and really take stock of my life in order to make a meaningful assessment of how grateful I should be for my circumstances.

      It looks like webtoon/the author took down a bunch of chapters. There was the Innsbridge season, then there was the bugs and the gun season (I can't remember their actual names), both are gone now.

    Annarasumanara, the best manhwa I've ever read; perhaps, even the best comic I've ever read.  (Not the Netflix series! I didn't even know there was one, and I don't trust Netflix with such adaptations.)

    It's a really beautiful and sad deconstruction of the classic fantasy romance trope "A girl is poor and bullied, a magic guy appears and makes her life great and/or takes her to a magic land." It's not actually a romance, though has some obvious undertones/plot points regarding that. I really want to say more, but I'm afraid of spoiling it. It's not quite short, but readable in one sitting (28 webtoon-length chapters), and it's very gripping.
    ```

  - u/Revlar:
    ```
    You could give [Jenna K. Moran's stuff](https://www.librarything.com/author/borgstromrsean) a shot. She's more well-known for her Tabletop RPGs, but she writes a lot of really interesting fiction with a very particular style. A lot of her short form fiction (with a sort of overarching meta of characters telling each other legends) is collected [here](http://hitherby-dragons.wikidot.com/).

    Her novels are also pretty good. Her style is fun to read.

    [Aspyxiation](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/asphyxiation-worm-alexandria-dresden-files.963349/threadmarks), by the same author, is another Worm / Dresden except it focuses much more on Rebecca the person, not Alexandria the cape.

  **Short fiction recommendation request**

  I like the ideas in a lot of the stories recommended here but they tend to be on the longer side, often 100+ chapters. Does anyone have good suggestions for shorter completed works? Preferably  less than 20k words or so, although anything up to short-novel length (100k?) would still be appreciated. 

  Hard-ish science fiction for preference, but I'll happily read most genres as long as the story has good ideas and/or an interesting setting. Professional fiction and web fiction are both good. I'm generally not a fan of litRPG, progression fantasy, or anything that goes too meta (eg characters that know they're in a story and exploit narrative tropes). 

  One last bit of context: I'm already familiar with the short story authors suggested on the wiki (Egan, Chiang, qntm, Scott Alexander etc) so it would be good to get recommendations that go beyond that group. I also made a similar request a year or so ago, although it only got a couple of responses - I can't find the link now but I did already read the suggested stories.

  Thanks in advance!

  I have a half-rec, or maybe anti-rec, YMMV

  Been reading the [Divine Apostasy](https://www.goodreads.com/series/280137-divine-apostasy) series by A.F. Key.

  The first book was promising, in a very cliche easy-reading fashion with some interesting ideas about the setting. The wider plot and setting in general I'm enjoying quite a lot.

  Unfortunately the characterisation just isn't very good. The author struggles with emotional representation; the characters either don't react at all, or react with extreme prejudice, randomly, playing into whatever cliche behaviour appealed to the author at the time. Idiot-balls abound, especially around communication with party members; this gets worse in later books rather than better.

  If you like litrpgs and a mmo-like vibe, and don't mind anti-rational characterization, this might still interest you enough. I'm mid book 4, and I'm still reading, though about every two-three chapters I have to groan at another idiotic, unnecessary action.

  Soooo, I guess for most people here this is an anti-rec; but maybe it captured your interest.
  ```

  So, is Ward worth reading? I read Worm and thought it was okay (though it felt overlong a lot), but I've repeatedly bounced off Pact and haven't read any of Wildbow's other stuff.
  ```

  - u/ArisKatsaris:
    ```
    May I suggest reading "Pale", Wildbow's current work? Many people seem to consider it the best of his works so far, and he also seems to like it the best from all the works he's written.
    ```

    - u/Master_Gazelle_6068:
      ```
      What's it about?
      ```

      - u/ArisKatsaris:
        ```
        It's set in the same urban fantasy universe as Pact, but it's completely unrelated in regards to characters/plot, so you can read it without any knowledge of Pact (in fact Pale is generally considered a better introduction to the universe than Pact).

        The beginning plot is (not spoiling anything beyond the prologue and first chapter):

        >!Three teenage girls in a small Canada town are introduced to magic by a group of non-human creatures, to become the local town's "practitioners", and to... look into a murder that occurred recently.!<

        Unlike previous Wildbow stories, it has three protagonists that are given equal screentime. I feel that the changing viewpoints and different personalities of the protagonists keep things fresh in a way that other Wildbow stories failed to do.
        ```

        - u/Master_Gazelle_6068:

          I'll have to check it out thank you! I did not enjoy Pact all that much despite finding the setting interesting so this sounds excellent.

    By itself ward is good, maybe even great, but as a sequel to worm it's bad imo. 

    light, non-specific spoilers:

    By far my least favourite thing is that ward is the kind of sequel that steps on its predecessor in order to distinguish itself as its own thing. It basically erases Taylor from the universe for example, in that wildbow goes to extreme lengths to exclude her from being relevant or ever mentioning her, except indirectly. One of the most nonsensical choices he made was that details surrounding the events of the Golden Morning, the apocalyptic fight for multiversal humanity, is basically unknown to the wider public. Can you imagine? Tens of thousands of individuals from multiple dimensions fight, billions of people die, the land is literally riven, mountains knocked down and the crust punctured, and yet no one is curious enough to know the truth and spread it, no one builds a mythology around the events. It beggars the imagination. 

    Along those lines, there is a lot of stuff that just isn't well thought out. Mostly background stuff, but the most impressive part of worm for me was that it was a jigsaw that slowly and methodically came together as you read. With ward there was a lot of stuff that didn't make sense in the beginning, and continued not making sense in the end.
    ```

    - u/Dragongeek:
      ```
      >sequel to worm it's bad

      This basically nails it. It's not really a sequel if the protagonists are all different and the setting has changed so significantly. 

      People who finished Worm and who are hankering for a continuation to the Worm will be disappointed, because Ward does not continue Worm. It just tells a whole new story about what happens after Worm.
      ```

      - u/Revlar:
        ```
        Well, you say that, but the Undersiders are all over the story, for example, and the protagonist is not a new characters. It probably wouldn't be considered such a "good story, bad sequel" if it was focused entirely on new characters and stayed away from Worm's cast. People aren't saying "it's not a sequel", they're saying "in the role of sequel, it performs poorly".
        ```

  - u/netstack_:
    ```
    Ward's basic premise is great, the character writing is snappy, the powers are cool and the emotional hits are real. Given that you're not completely starstruck by Worm, that probably outweighs the downsides.

    I will second GlueBoy's review, loosely, with the caveat that I didn't find the handling of Gold Morning to be so bad. It was suitably apocalyptic/cult-forming/chaotic for me, and it clearly changed people. But Ward *does* step on parts of Worm in order to maintain tension.
    ```

  - u/SvalbardCaretaker:
    ```
    I stopped reading regular updates at arc 18, planning to take it up again. Same brilliant fight scenes and subtle characterisation, all viewed through the lens of a much more socially adept and adult protagonist.
    ```

  - u/Revlar:
    ```
    It marks Wildbow's turn into a different writer with different priorities. I bounced off of it multiple times and ended up finishing it when I made reading it part of my commute. There are people for whom it's the best of the lot, but I still prefer the Worm/Pact/Twig era.

    I do feel like most of the criticisms I can level towards the story are infohazardous. The problems I have with the story are sticking points that the people who love it seem to entirely dodge, so priming people to see them would be unfair of me.
    ```

    - u/Master_Gazelle_6068:
      ```
      For me I found that Twig was my favorite of his works, even if I read and think about Worm significantly more than Twig. I voted for Twig in his "what to do next" poll and was highly disappointed when he went with Pact so I was ecstatic about Twig being written.

      The writing felt very different to Worm itself so that can either be a draw or a push away from the work.
      ```

      - u/Revlar:
        ```
        Twig is definitely his best work while it was running, imo. It was more imaginative and poignant than Worm or Pact via its setting, it leaned into the horror in a good way and it also had moments Wildbow hasn't really managed to recreate since, like >!the protagonist's supporting cast becoming direct antagonists and then coming back together.!< There was a real dynamism to the whole thing, with even the setting morphing as the story continued.

        The problem is, imo, that it wasn't popular because people were waiting for Ward. So many people would make posts speculating on whether Twig would end "this week or the next" so Worm 2 could start, and the analytics on the story must've been depressing. The way the story wraps up and the way Wildbow talks about it in its post-mortem blogpost, Twig's ending and anemic epilogue are probably a direct result of that.

        Pale is probably a much nicer story to write for Wildbow, just because nobody's out there demanding Worm 3.
        ```

        - u/Master_Gazelle_6068:
          ```
          I thought Twig hit the horror genre perfectly. It had a great blend of all the subgenres within horror itself and was masterful at building tension without being memetic escalation like Worm did. The issues that were brought up were all things I had thought about from the introduction to the setting.

          I didn't read any of the discussion or speculation on it like I did for Worm. Loved just doing a blind read of it. I think it really helped solidify my appreciation for it by not dealing with any complaints or nitpicking

          Well sure, but that's because Twig suffers from a Game of Thrones tier ending. The story is blatantly pulling in the opposite direction the entire time, and then the rope snaps and the whole thing tumbles into the garbage and you're just... supposed to feel catharsis from the tragedy of it all, I guess? It's really poorly executed. It's definitely not a match for the level of emotional engagement the story was building up to for its entire run.
          ```

          - u/flame7926:
            ```
            Wait, what? I thought the ending to Twig was the best of wildbows endings (or at least out of Twig, pact, and worm) - it was engaging with a realistic level of tension and escalation in a way that didn't make you want to sink into a hole

          - u/hoja_nasredin:
            ```
            Hmm. This explains it. By the end of Twig I felt like I cared very little. Everything was getting destroyed around them. I didn't enjoy the ending. I'm not sure what I was expecting but the emotions just were not there.   


            But I did appreciate Twig for the monsters. Those were amazing. I really dug that lovecraftian/victorian/bloodborne feel.

      I tried the first one and found it to be pretty mediocre. Is it worth pushing past?

        Probably, yes. Third book is a step up, fourth is actually good. The one about ghosts much later in the series is the only other stinker, you can actually skip that one as it's barely relevant to the overarching plot. You could try skipping book 2 and going on to 3, or just read book 2, depending on preference. Book 3 introduces some characters that are important later on so probably not that great to skip.

      tell me more about them. Especially RIvers of London.

        Paranoid Mage: recent urban fantasy on RoyalRoad that has gotten popular. Premise is guy discovers he has magic powers at 30 years of age, but the worldwide magic organization wants him to draft into military service, and is kind of a dick and tyrant. He decides to evade detection by using techniques to anonymize his identity and location (like burner phones, using untracked transportation methods, using cash, etc) and learning magic from the internet. 

        Zombie Knight Saga: takes place in alternate Earth where there are undead magic users, ancient artifacts of immense power, magic ballistic missiles and iron man exosuits, and long hidden societies. Closest thing I can compare it to is Hunter x Hunter but in fiction form. Really interesting power usage and mechanics. 

        Rivers of London: Urban magic taking place in London, some no name police officer gets involved in the magic underground. What's interesting about it is that magic is coming back (instead of losing potency), and protagonist is a part of the pioneers who discover magic. Low stakes and good humor.

    Sunshine, Robin Mckinley. Vampires, baking, great worldbuilding. 

    Metropolitan, Walter Jon Williams. Urban Fantasy, you say? How about a Magical Ecumenopolis?

    The Witness for the Dead, Katherine Addison.  Death priest, which entails quite a lot of investigating.

  I guess this is the right place to ask this  


  Some time ago, someone posted an absolutely perfect version of the Fate/Stay Night Unlimited Blade Works incantation but with Unlimited Breadsticks. Does anyone remember it?

  Here's a crack at it, not as good

   I am the crust of my bread.  
   Salad is my body and soup is my blood.  
   I have eaten over a thousand meals.  
   Unaware of hunger,  
   Nor aware of fullness.  
   Withstood waiting alone, awaiting the rest of my party’s arrival.  
   I have no regrets. This is the only path.  
   My whole life iss Unlimited Bread Sticks.
  ```

    ```
    Are you sure it's specifically breadsticks? The obvious pun would be "unlimited bread works" which returns plenty of search results on Reddit and elsewhere (although none on r/rational as far as I can tell)
    ```

  - u/MoneyLicense:
    ```
    have you tried [https://camas.unddit.com](https://camas.unddit.com) (previously: [https://camas.github.io/reddit-search](https://camas.github.io/reddit-search)).

    I couldn't find it when searching with keywords "breadsticks" nor "bread stick" or ""bread sticks"
    ```
