## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  Nobody's posted yet today so I'll put in a small question that I will of course ask in a very long winded way: how affected do you think vampires are by their "human" lives? 

  Like, obviously a vampire who is <200yo would probably be very affected by it. But many vampires are a thousand years old or more.

  There's a thing about subjective perception of time, something like at the age of 30 you've already filled up half of your "memory space"/"subjective time space" - so would vampires have a logarithmic memory, where there are bigger chunks of "storage space" devoted to earlier stuff? Or would it be like that character in Dr Who where the brain can't hold everything and so forgets? (Probably not for My Vampires, but maybe for someone else's, since My Vampires have very good memories)

  I'm trying to write more vampire POV scenes and I started having him remember his human life, to try to relate to his human lover (you know, "humans are different, but I was one of them once, what was important to me then? What could be important to him now?"), but it seems so... lame and tropey, to have a guy in the 1940s remember the forest of Gaul c.600 CE. My instinct would be that he'd have so many more experiences in his long life that the long-lost days of his youth would be less relevant than, say, a human he took pity on and spared during feeding in say 1400, or a bard's poem he happened to listen to. 

  But maybe it would make sense to lock onto your human past in order to try and capture the subjective emotions? But would it be something you would even think of as being part of you and your experiences in any meaningful way after so long?

  Like, I was thinking of writing a little thing about Vampire, I don't know, talking to himself in his Original Language, or singing an old war-song, etc, and being sad/broody about the fact that nobody alive would understand it, that those words and syllables are the last survivors of the people he knew and loved as a human. And then I'm like, "for all I know he might have spent a couple of hundred years being worshipped as a sky-king by a cult in iraq c1100CE, would that sort of thing really be on his radar? and if it was, would he weep for the loss of that ancient iraqi cult just as much?". And then I'm like broody depressed All My Friends Are Dead vampires are lame and that's not what I want.

    > you know, "humans are different, but I was one of them once, what was important to me then? What could be important to him now?"

    This could be a comedy goldmine, if he doesn't account for drift over time and between cultures. 

    > But maybe it would make sense to lock onto your human past in order to try and capture the subjective emotions?

    I don't think that it makes sense from the point of view of someone who's taking a step back and adopting the Outside View, but unless vampires become perfectly rational beings upon joining the ranks of the undead, something like "maybe experiences from my short human life will be more relevant than those from my longer, post-mortem unlife" is, if not perfectly reasonable, then at least something I would expect to see. 

    > And then I'm like, "for all I know he might have spent a couple of hundred years being worshipped as a sky-king by a cult in iraq c1100CE, would that sort of thing really be on his radar? and if it was, would he weep for the loss of that ancient iraqi cult just as much?". And then I'm like broody depressed All My Friends Are Dead vampires are lame and that's not what I want.

    There are really happy, really old people who are neither broody and waiting to join all their dead friends in the Big Sky Party, nor nihilistic and uncaring about the present despite having seen it all before. If you can find some articles or interviews that give insight into how they categorize things then that might be helpful (and I imagine that the majority of old vampires have figured out how to find joy in the present, because suicide is as easy as leaving the curtains open before you go to sleep). 

    > how affected do you think vampires are by their "human" lives?

    Some vampires may think upon it fondly, not exactly in a way that makes them mourn what's been lost but in the way that people think fondly upon their childhoods. Others may be incredibly embarrassed by their former lives. I mean, I'm embarrassed by who I was just a few years ago, so I'm pretty sure that I'd be embarrassed by who I was a century ago, had I been alive back then. 

    Also, how do your vampires deal with the shift in morality over time and across cultures? Among other things, I've been thinking lately about how people often make the argument that there have been "moral advances" over the centuries but, at the same time, there are people who lived two thousand years ago or more and whose positions on animal rights, pacifism, equality between the sexes, caring for the unfortunate, and so on would put most modern people to shame, despite how many people today think that the ancients were all savages. For a Jain or follower of Modi who was turned into a vampire a very, very long time ago, it's probably a weird experience to not only see mainstream morality shifting, as it always does, but shifting ever more closely in accordance with the values that everyone else once considered to be wackadoo nonsense. On the other hand, someone whose values have been left behind will likely be infuriated by that but it must give such a person pause to see how morality just keeps on shifting and to realize that morals have *always* been shifting. It's one thing to complain about the younger generations and another to see that younger generation then complain about the next one, for five or ten iterations on, but see everything move along all the same.

      Yeah, but given the particular vampire is somewhat integrated in human society, and vampire culture is continuously "refreshed" by newly turned humans, it's probably not going to be an endless source of hilarious misunderstandings either. I'd imagine vampires would be somewhat interested in human culture (if only because they depend on it not just for food but for things like e.g. getting their mansions built), so while they might not always know the specifics, they'd be no more out of touch than the average parent, if you get me. 

      > unless vampires become perfectly rational beings upon joining the ranks of the undead

      My partner is convinced that just being alive for 1000 years would make you more rational and analytical, because you'd have time to realise it's the best way to get what you want. But I don't want My Vampires to be rationalists, so I'm not sticking to that. But it's something he *does not like* about My Vampires.

      > If you can find some articles or interviews that give insight into how [really old people] categorize things then that might be helpful

      That's an absolutely fantastic idea. I can't believe I didn't think of "interviews with a centenarian" as a proxy for "vampire perspective on time". Thank you for the recommendation! I will get on that.

      > [fond childhood memories vs self-cringe]

      Very true. I'm sure an old vampire would have moments of both throughout their long history. 

      > Also, how do your vampires deal with the shift in morality over time and across cultures? 

      That's a tricky one. My first instinct was to respond with "they are a post gender post racial society who instead focuses on age differences which are an absolute proxy for power, and of course humans are only worth anything insomuch as they are considered property of the vampire who 'owns' them", but then I'm conveniently *basically* giving vampire society Values Of My Ideal Society Probably, which seems like a hell of a cop-out. Like, they're beyond racism and sexism but they are still OK with killing humans? Society today is getting to be beyond racism and sexism and at the same time getting to be beyond killing animals for food, and the vampire-human gap is smaller (especially for young vampires) than the animal-human gap. 

      The thing is, I don't want vampires to be racist or sexist, so I guess I need to pull vampires further ahead of "modern" (1940s) society, or give them a weirdtopia thing (which I can't even begin to think of any candidates for, beyond perhaps thinking of religious iconography as "unclean"; they already have a superstition against touching money; but none of those are weirdtopia because it needs to be something that is proper weird or seems wrong/gross rather than "isn't this interesting")

      > On the other hand, someone whose values have been left behind will likely be infuriated by that 

      I've recently written an interlude where Catholic!Vampire!William visits a catholic priest, does a confession, and after getting the divine forgiveness (which is an extremely long-standing part of catholic dogma it turns out), he kills the priest because he's a heretic anyway, but he's the least heretical of the many heretics who are out there practising their unrecognisable religions. 

      Maybe this is just my vision of William, but I view him as being amused/interested/entertained by all the various changes in human culture, fashion, and values. I've got a plot bunny where he goes to a gay nightclub in the 80s and sees a guy wearing a mesh shirt and is like "oh my god! This is amazing! who thought this idea up? I love it."

      > [moral advances etc in general]

      I'm not sure how much of my draft you read, but the central conflict in the human-vampire relationship ends up being about slavery and their different impressions of that, and I think it's pretty weak at the moment because I have to make it a "genuine miscommunication that gets worked out", whilst at the same time having a 1500 year old vampire decide that slavery is wrong, and I'm just kind of uncomfortable about the whole thing, especially because I'm not even American let alone African-American so I'm not sure how well I've handled the topic *at all*.

      So in the end the vampire objects not to slavery itself but to enslaving equals for no fault of their own (rather than enslaving lessers - eg vampire enslaving human - or enslaving war losers). I read an old SSC post where Scott is talking about how American Slavery was kind of an aberration as far as slavery goes, and many slaves in antiquity were able to save money to ultimately buy their freedom, so I might do some more research into all that sort of thing and see if that ticks some more boxes.

      But then I don't want to have the vampire say, "slavery isn't wrong, but it's wrong if you don't allow someone to buy their freedom back after working for you for 7 years and also if they didn't do anything to deserve it" - because that's kind of a reprehensible thing to say, and I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with a character in a story I put out there saying those things.

      So it's tricky, especially because slavery seems like the best point of conflict as it came out organically as a conflict point between the two characters when me and my coauthor were planning the story via roleplay. So I really don't want to have us pick something else (which may be difficult).

      > It's one thing to complain about the younger generations and another to see that younger generation then complain about the next one, for five or ten iterations on, but see everything move along all the same.

      And we end back up at jaded old vampires getting bored with life! I guess it's a trope for a reason, eh?

        ```
        I have a weird and probably out of place idea for how to make vampires post-gender post-racial, give them some limited form of shapeshifting. It can be like regeneration in Doctor Who where every once in a while their whole body changes, though they might have some more control over it. I like the idea of it being influenced by "you are what you eat" as a way for their species to blend into their surroundings.

        So when a vampire moves to a new location and feeds on the locals, they'll eventually change to more resemble them and have to take on a new identity in their society. After spending multiple lifetimes as different ethnicities and genders, it's harder to rationalize prejudice. The older, more worldly vampires would discourage such behavior from the younger ones and encourage them to experiment.
        ```

        - u/MagicWeasel:
          ```
          I really love that idea, but I don't think I'd be game to use it. 

          I can see so many cool consequences of it, too. Young vampires who knew about this from the get-go would probably try and stick to a very specific type of prey to maintain their own apperance. Maybe those serial killers who target young blonde women are vampires?

          But as vampires got older they'd start caring less and less about who they ate because no matter how many beautiful young blonde women they eat, their face would no longer be recognisable to them, since their own bone structure would have long since faded into mystery.

          Would also explain why vampires are so beautiful, as people tend to prefer "the average face". And as a corollary, old vampires would probably have a "look".

          My Vampires also run on nanites that use their DNA as a blueprint, so you'd even have a mechanism for this - the DNA from the blood they drink regularly would dilute the DNA that the nanites get from the "original" corpse. (Though a lot of face stuff is epigenetics/growth/etc but let's ignore that).

          It's a very cool idea! I wish I could use it.

        About fifty-percent. And I'm finally getting things in order now that I'm out of the Hell University of Idaho, so I should be able to do another read-through by the end of the week. 

        > And we end back up at jaded old vampires getting bored with life!

        I wasn't meaning that they'd be bored with life, just less fundamentalist about things because they've seen so many changes. Like, it's hard to argue that gay people are destroying society when you have three hundred years' experience of seeing people make the same argument about other groups to no effect. 

        As for being post-racial, I can't imagine that the older vampires would even identify in racial terms that we'd recognize and it would be hard for them to take our conceptions of race very seriously. "Look, don't try to talk to me about how white people are better than everyone or race-mixing is bad or multicultural centers are hellholes, I remember when the Irish and the Italians weren't white, etc. etc." 

        You might also want to look at different strains of anarchism. I don't think that's quite where you're going with vampire society, but their society is loose enough that you might find some interesting ideas to play around with so far as professed virtues go.
        ```

        - u/MagicWeasel:
          ```
          With all this talk about Irish and Italians not being white, you're making me think of the [Cagots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cagot): Basically, a despised French minority group who were in no easily determinable way any different from anyone else. 

          No doubt vampires may well have thrown their hands up in disgust - or they might have their own outcast caste.

          Anarchism might be a good well to draw on! Neoreactionaries, too, maybe. (Honestly the neoreactionary way of thinking might ultimately be what would appeal most to one of my vampires, but no reason not to give others  different ideas.)

            I love how cyclical it seems to have become, if this line is any indication: 

            > They were feared because they were persecuted and might therefore seek revenge.

            "Those awful Cagots might lash out against us because of how we treat them. Better bump up the persecution by a notch!"
            ```

  - u/trekie140:
    ```
    I like how u/callmebrotherg suggests them thinking about their human lifetime similarly to their childhood, and I think you could take that a step further and treat the various identities they've taken over the centuries as careers they pursued. Some lifetimes were happier than others, but fate gave them opportunities that they took advantage of in order to prosper.

    Vampires have to adopt and abandon identities in order to stay hidden and support themselves, so they might think of them as jobs they've worked. Some were more pleasant than others and some required relearning what they knew, but it was always something they had to do and helped define who they were. Of course, jobs mean different things to different people.

    I don't think there's anything wrong with your vampire feeling nostalgic for the past, though if he were introspective about how he's changed as a person since then it might avoid the cliche. He's not the same person he was before and may wonder if that's a good thing, but he has been many different people over the centuries by his own choices and the compulsions of others.

    In the case of him being sentimental about the past, perhaps he doesn't long for his old life but just wants to remind himself of it. He doesn't want it back, he just doesn't want to forget how important it was to him. Maybe he wants to avoid making the same mistakes or continue to honor the memory of losses he's come to terms with. For him, it's like taking an old photo album out.

      Thank you very much for your comment! I really like the idea of the job analogy, as I think that's a great well to draw on too. 

      > he has been many different people over the centuries

      That's a very profound thought, thank you for putting it into words. I'm beginning to make a detailed plan for Volume 2 of my story, where Vampire meets with a person from his distant past, and the thought that they were both obviously different people back then is a great one to work with. I'm imagining some serious code-switching going on.

      >  For him, it's like taking an old photo album out.

      Great analogy. The really rough stuff I scratched out the past few days basically has memories of the long past coming to him, unbidden, when his human partner is talking about his own life/thoughts/worries/etc. 

      I don't think I want to go ahead with it as written. I like the idea of it being a kind of "focused meditation", where he chooses to think those thoughts in that time and place, perhaps to gain insights into what humanity is or maybe just because he has fond memories of his long-dead wife and children.

      Thank you again!

        Another good analogy might be an adult finding a toy from their childhood that they long since stopped playing with, but seeing it again brings up some happy memories. Unlike other pieces of their past they got rid of, they like having it around even if they'll rarely do anything with it. Maybe they decide to put it on their shelf instead of leaving in the attic because they decide they don't want to forget again, or finally give it to someone else because they don't need it anymore.

        I don't know if comparing vampire's relationships to humans should be comparable to humans and objects, though, even if people vary in their respect for their possessions. However, pursuing the angle of the human reminding the vampire of happier times he'd forgotten about could be very romantic. I keep thinking of scenes from Pixar films like Ratatouille and Toy Story 3 where we see characters rediscover their past and become better people as a result.

          Yeah... this is something I'm personally pretty guilty of. 

          > However, pursuing the angle of the human reminding the vampire of happier times he'd forgotten about could be very romantic.

          Yeah, I think the story is going to be a lot about transitions and adapting to your partner as you both go through different stages of your lives - though with a vampire and a human who goes through various stages of supernatural bondage to the vampire before ultimately ending up as an independent vampire himself, it's just slightly more turmurtulous than the average human might deal with.

          > I don't know if comparing vampire's relationships to humans should be comparable to humans and objects

          This is very tricky to handle right, you're correct. It's especially bad because I can't conceive of how a 1500 year old vampire dating a 22 year old human is going to be anything *other* than pretty squicky when you think about the vampire's POV in any sort of depth. The human winds up adopting a dog and my partner was saying he thought the whole dog plotline was very transparent in terms of "vampire is to human as human is to dog", when all I really meant by that was wanting to give the human a dog because he would be lonely during the day otherwise. But hey, if the shoe fits... it is a pretty perfect analogy. 

          And like I said above, it's all about the transitions, so ultimately the vampire will be seeing the human as more of an equal - just not straight at the beginning of the story. 

          Thanks again for all your comments! It's so very helpful!

    Being worshiped as a sky-king would get pretty mundane if you looked at activities on a day-to-day basis.

    If I met the King, I'd be having a once-in-a-lifetime experience.  Adrenaline's going.  And I'm imagining telling my grand-kids about what it was like to be in a massive hall.

    The King is on his seventh meeting of the day.  He's probably running on autopilot.  "Minion shows up.  Looks like generic scribe.  Nervous.  Tell him Joke #3 to get him to relax.  Ok, he's saying his thing. What decision do I need to make here?  Can I get this done before lunch?  Man this chair is uncomfortable.  Didn't i tell someone to fix that yesterday?  Oh.  Scribe stopped talking.  Look serious.  What was the question again?"

    The experience might be like living on a cruise-ship, except with people nervously interrupting you every 30 minutes.  Plus, your friends want to steal your stuff.  And you have to spend large chunks of time stoically 'presiding' over random gatherings.

    You'd get used to the physical perks (Food! Whenever you want!) and they'd fall into the background.  Decisions are filtered through orders given to 3-10 close advisers.  So the actual experience of ruling wouldn't be all that different than managing a regional chain of video rental stores.

    So, becoming a God-King is almost certainly memorable.  But the actual day-to-day experience wouldn't necessarily be any more intense than anything else.  And I don't think it would make your vampire unable to appreciate lesser positions.

    -----

    For relationships, I'd look to dog ownership.  Bernese Mountain Dogs live 6-8 years.  I knew a guy who lived on a bunch of land and had 4 of them at a time.  A dog breeder, over their lifetime, could easily have owned 40+ dogs.

    You'd never expect a dog breeder to be all broody and depressed over dog-ownership.  Even after decades, they'd still be excited to see a puppy learn a new trick.  And they'd still mourn when a dog passed away.

    I think they'd just be kind of pragmatic about the whole thing.  Lives come.  And they go.  You celebrate when it's time for joy.  And you mourn when it's time for sadness.  Experience the feelings, and know that things change.

    At the same time, not all dogs would fade from memory equally fast.  The dog-breeder probably remembers a bunch about his first puppy.  Those experiences were new and extra intense.  And he probably has a handful of really special dogs who stick out in his memory, as The Champion Show-dog or The Amazing Friend.

    If you apply that to human/vampire relationships, I'd expect that the vampire has several relationships going at once.  They could be staggered.  You might have the 20-year-old he's just meeting.  The 40-year-old who's now raising a human family / running a chunk of the vampire's empire.  And the 80-year-old who he meets to reminisce about old times.

    Alternately, if the vampire is a 'serial monogamist', I think they might optimize for partners who are intensely memorable in some way.   Here, I'd look for superlatives.  It's someone who's beautiful AND driven to achieve ___.

    ------

    Finally, for reminiscing, I'd think about what it's like to explain childhood minutia to a foreign friend (or someone from a younger generation).

    A few weeks ago, I was talking to a co-worker about a time that I'd forgotten my ID when trying to buy beer.  The clerk challenged me to sing the chorus from the "Gummy Bear" theme song.

    Co-Worker and I launched into a terrible rendition of it.  The people under 30 had absolutely no idea what we were singing.  And the people under 30 from outside the US were lost.  Not only did they not know the show, the whole "Saturday Morning Cartoon" thing relied on a bunch of cultural context that they just didn't have.

    I'd expect your vampire to have similar feelings about Gaul.  He wouldn't pine for the forests for the same reason that I don't pine for the early 1990s.  It's too different, and I'm too distant.

    Instead, he'd have memories of really small things.  The thing itself might be easy to explain ("this is a conker!  We had them when I was young"), but the cultural context that made it special would be almost impossible ("You'd tie a string through your conker and then swing them at each other.  No, not to hit the other player.  That's 'hot cockles'.  You hit the other conker.  And then you see whose conker shatters!")
    ```
