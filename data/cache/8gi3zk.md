## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  What do you think about low gravity in a fantasy setting? The only piece of media that I can think of that used it was the Barsoom series, and besides not really exploring the idea very well, it's pretty inaccurate given what we know today. 

  I think the idea has a lot of untapped potential, and it's an interesting way to shake things up, but not too much so that it detracts from the actual story. 

  Some thoughts, assuming gravity is around half that of earth:

  * It would be almost trivial to use airships to lift massive amounts of cargo, and airplanes would also need a lot less initial complexity to work. It's possible a lot of those [ridiculous flying contraptions](https://www.google.com/search?q=ridiculous+flying+contraptions&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjgvvuRtufaAhWU0YMKHZG0CckQ_AUICigB&biw=1920&bih=1109/) could have actually worked. Human powered heavier than air flight in the renaissance is an awesome image.  

  * Even if powered flight is not a thing, gliders would definitely be way more effective and safe. They would be smaller, and go farther. Climb mountains or build high towers and glide everywhere!

  * Speaking of which, building taller buildings would be easier too. Architecture in general would be very different. Skyscrapers in a medieval setting?

  * Delta-v to get to low orbit would be way lower. Possibly low enough to fling up some magic satellites or have magical sub-orbital flights? 

  * Assuming a similar atmospheric pressure, it's plausible to imagine a massive airbourne ecosystem, extending all the way up into the upper atmosphere. Floating plants, and jellyfish like creatures that collect hydrogen to float like balloons, in addition to birds with massive wings that never have to land. Maybe creatures that live off of or inside clouds? Massive floating whales?

  * Humans born and bred in low g would likely be very tall and skinny. They would also be physically weaker, with brittle bones and weaker muscles. Even with strength training they would likely be unable to switch to higher gravities for long. 

  * Humans from normal gravity coming into a lower gravity would have a massive advantage in strength, but only for a short time before experiencing heart and bone deconditioning. You lied us Edgar Rice Burroughs!

  * Would life expectancy increase or decrease? And interesting question that I could not find a clear answer on, as all our limited knowledge is about microgravity, not low-G. There would be less strain on our hearts, but they might also decondition like in microgravity. Telomere lengthening has also been observed in microgravity. Would that hold true for .5G?

    I'm pretty interested in any implications of this that are brought up.

    I have a setting with magic that manipulates gravity, mostly used to create low-G fields to aid in construction and to enable the use of ridiculous flying machines.

    The fact that they're only creating a field of low G (usually .3G, .2G if they're using the sophisticated stuff) diminishes the results, as the air and what have you above the field is fully affected, pushing down into the field. 

    The reverse is also possible in setting. 

    The only applications I've been allowing to work so far as far as heightening Gravity goes are:

    Creating bombs to slow down and generally encumber dangerous creatures and combatants, making them vulnerable by using the earth's mass.

    Testing structural integrity.

    Terrorism against shoddy structures.

    The combined use of density manipulation and gravity heightening.

    That last one I'm not sure about. The reason I brought up the reverse is that I'm not sure how quickly conditioning would occur. I haven't been worrying about it so far. If it is a concern for low gravity, it could be an advantage to high gravity. Training under exposure to high G to improve strength and health during work and combat at regular or lower G.

      Huh.

      If you volumetrically reduce gravity, that likely manifests in a couple of ways:
      - Reduced downward acceleration of things. (weight reduction)
      - Reduced fluid pressure

      I _think_ think means that the air functionally is a low-pressure zone, which does interesting things to fluid flow. I'd naively expect air to flow in from above and the sides, into the zone, until pressure equalizes - so you'd end up with more air (by mass) in the affected volume, and the same pressure; and a brief air flow while pressure equalizes.

      This may then make pushing against the air more effective: you effectively have more reaction mass.

      Now - once the zone starts moving, hmm - Let's consider upwards motion. You have air at the top now subject to less gravity, resulting in it being less pressurized. You have air at the bottom leaving the affected volume, so now it's heavier (and there's more of it packed into the same volume), so now you have greater pressure. But.... that greater pressure is less able to move the air above it (more mass) compared to the sides...?

      So, then consider putting airships of some kind into the picture: What if the ship is greatly contained by the changed gravity volume? What if, say, the zeppelin envelope completely contains the changed gravity volume?

      There's also temperature considerations, if my conclusions about pressure are correct.

      (So then also consider what happens if you cycle between high/normal/low/normal/high gravity.)

      Too bad you're not doing  high G fields. A small field of 10g for a split second could knock someone out, or even kill them.

    Decent question. Re the flight elements, there is an excellent XKCD on this. https://what-if.xkcd.com/30/ - TLDR, go flying on Titan, it has low gravity AND a dense atmosphere, though a little chilly....

    Mega fauna would be more mega. I think limits on animal scaling generally come from cube square scaling laws so stuff would be huge.

    Interesting!

    I would expect humans to never evolve there but instead appearing in that world through a magical portal or something. 

    * You can finally have all those giant monsters that are satisfying to kill but due to low gravity they are not super strong, hence feasible to kill.


    * I would like to explore a more fantasy setting, since consistent implication of a modern setting would be too difficult. 

    * You can finally have your justification for elves being high, slender and fragile.

    * Massive floating whales are always cool. I prefer them sailing in cosmic void and bathing in the Sun photosphere, but this works too.

    * The low gravity same pressure means the Pressure vary slower with change of altitude. Not sure about the temperature. More chance of mountain peaks being colonized.

    * Add some helium source for exploration.

    * Trees will be higher. Cities on giant pines? Like the Ewok villages?

    * Maybe elves, dwarves and humans are the same species just completing last steps of evolution  on 3 planets with different G?

    * Would lower g mean more tunnels and caverns in the planet?

    * As for life expectancy, fucking with life conditions we were evolved to live in would reduce life expectancy. Sure Earth gravity makes our hearts work too much and our bones and tendons continuously damage themselves but unless given time to evolve  or being reengineered I would say a drastic chance will fuck up too many things at once.

    * What if instead of 70% N2 the atmosphere contained 70% of some much heavier gas? Xenon? This would make breathing slightly more difficult but increase the ability of things to float and fly.

    Uh, correct me if I'm wrong, but why do you expect airships to be easier?

    If you keep the composition, pressure and temperature the same, then the density rho of air is the same. Now, an object as a whole experiences g* (mass - volume* rho) force. Whether this is positive (fall down), zero (float), or negative (ballon goes up) is unaffected by your local gravity g.

  Here’s one idea that I’m playing with for a story, suggestions? I’m also wondering if I should add in a hard magic system to create more opportunities & interesting cultural implications or if that would complicate the setting too much. 

      * People live within tunnels (the bronchioles of a large aquatic mammal)
            * it usually floats around near the surface of the water (no predators)
            * The world has a high oxygen content & it is very warm
            * this helps the creature to function at such a large size

      * Survive off blood from capillaries in alveoli & any food they can get from the ecosystem on the surface/outside of animal

      * Must control population in order to prevent overexploitation of mammal
            * powerful people control the population in order to maintain sustainability - 
                    *getting rid of people/communities when necessary (not common knowledge)
            * Those who control the limited resources (blood) have a lot of social power
            *  large wealth gap - people are desensitized to death of the lower class

      * people travel through the lungs using a glider of some sort -> breathing creates strong air currents

      * One can easily get accidentally swept up in a breath & brought outside
             * Going outside is dangerous & explorers from outside are well respected 

  Side note: I’m planning on creating it in the form of a comic. I’m an amateur artist but writing dialogue isn’t my strong suit so if anyone wants to partner with me to create this, I’d be really happy. I have quite a few ideas but no concrete plans for plot at the moment so you’d have an equal part in creating the story. Anyway PM me if interested/want more info.

    Do common people inside know they live in a giant animal?

    * It can be a story of revolutionary rebelling old customs and then bringing an apocalypse on the community.

    * Hav you watched Gurren Lagann? It is an anime where people live in caves underground and are hunted if they go to surface. Protagonist rebels and destroys the Surface king.... And then we discover WHY the king was keeping humans underground.

    * I tried to read a Russian novel about meatpunk (people obtain most resources/materials from giant sea creatures) and despite good recensions I disliked it. Without magic I felt to sorry for this people having to survive in such conditions. 

    * As a form of magic you can use psionic the way Dark Sun did it. 

    * also fights with other parasites living in the giants flesh.
