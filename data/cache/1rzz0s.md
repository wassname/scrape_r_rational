  Don't suppose anyone knows how to get hold of an RSS feed for fanfiction.net stories? I've tried searching around and it sounds like they're removed the links to them, but that by constructing the right URL it might still be possible.

  I want to follow this, but I know I won't necessarily remember to go and check on it, or check on a user account on the site, unless I can fold it into how I read everything else I subscribe to.

    I made a site for this! [link](http://feephome.no-ip.org/~feep/m.rss_proxy.cgi) source [rss_proxy.cgi](https://gist.github.com/7780150) (user interface) [rss_proxy.d](https://gist.github.com/7780157) (actual updater). (If there's exploits, please tell me instead of abusing them!)

    About the AbortException thing, for some reason trying to load from ff.net used to run into an error at the end, so I just went for "grab all the data we can and hope it's enough". :shrug:

      Well you're now my favourite person for today... I mean, it's only like 00:19am here, so maybe that's a low bar, but I think you're still a strong contendor.
