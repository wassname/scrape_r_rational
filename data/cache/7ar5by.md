## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  * 1. You play as a harmless growth that has appeared on an adult person’s brain. 
   * 1.1. If given the opportunity, you’ll eventually increase to a certain size and stop developing any further. 
   * 1.2. For whatever reason, this encroachment of your “body” into your host’s brain’s real estate wouldn't damage your host’s brain\mind.
   * 1.3. To be able to grow to your full size and potential (#3.), you’ll need your host to consume certain substances that to a regular person would’ve been quite toxic.
  * 2. When you appear (that is, appear in your “level 1” size and develop your own consciousness), your host becomes aware of you and the connection between their mind and yours. 
   * 2.1. You have access to all the data that your host gets from their senses.
   * 2.2. You and your host can communicate with each other, exchanging verbalised messages and pockets of larger data.
  * 3. In your fully developed state, your mind will have its own “computational power” that is independent from that of your host’s brain and roughly equal to the capabilities of a baseline adult human mind.
   * 3.1. Other than that (and if we ignore #1.2. and #1.3.) you don’t have any superpowers or paranormal qualities.

  1. How do you convince your host that you do not pose any threat to them, and that they do not have to surgically get rid of you, etc?
  2. How can you and your host benefit the most from your unique position, use it as a unique competitive edge over other people, etc?

    Hi. Um, I know this is weird and awkward and - I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to startle you! Oh man, oh wow, it's just - um, my name is Emily and I sort of live in your brain. 

    So, um, first off - you don't need to be scared of me. I know I surprised you and that you're really freaked and that it feels *awful*. I hate that feeling, seriously, I'm kind of a scaredy cat. So, see, um. I need to explain something first off, right away, so you know how this is and everything, because you have some decisions you need to make and you can't make good decisions on bad information. (You read that someplace once, and it was a smart thing to read.)

    See, you might be worried about me being here and maybe you could get to worry if I was going to hurt you or something? But it's sort of the other way around. You can remove me or kill me any time, so, I was really nervous about even letting you know I existed. But... see, well, I don't think it's right, me being here and you never knowing about me, so I figured I needed to say hello and let you know I existed and... well. I was lonely. 

    I can't talk to anyone but you, really. You're it, you're my only person. I can listen when you talk to other people and I can see what you see, but I can't talk to anyone but you. Which is a little scary, to be honest. And I know how intrusive it is that I can see this stuff! So, I'm going to try really hard to make sure I only do that when you're ok with it because, um, you've got privacy, right? But please don't lock me out too much, it gets really dark in here and I don't like the dark much. 

    So, I just wanted to say hello, and say - I know you can get rid of me, and I'd like to ask if you'd be ok with letting me stay for a while? Like a test run. See, I can't do much. No hands, no control, nothing. But... I can be a friend, if you want one. Someone who's here for you no matter what. (I know - it's one of those, it's not like I have a choice. But I've seen some of what you've seen in the world and frankly, you seem pretty cool. I can think of way, way worse people to be stuck with, and so can you.) 

    So if you're ok with it, if it's not too much - I want to try being your friend. Being someone to talk to you when you want, or just someone to bounce ideas off of, or someone to help you keep on track with stuff - like, I can remind you when it's time to go to the gym, and I can keep track of your food so you can know when to get more milk, and if you really want me to I can try and help you with the weight thing. I can't control anything, but if you put on headphones at night and let me listen to nutrition podcasts and stuff I can maybe help out with your meals and everything? And I can help you study the same way - it's not really cheating, is it, if all the information is in your head, right? 

    It might be cool, if I do the studying - it'll leave you more free time. I can be like a tutor you keep around with you all the time. I can learn languages while you sleep then we can travel all over! Oh man. 

    Um. Maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. Sorry! I'm sorry, I just - I know it's weird and I'll go away now and let you think, because like I said, you have some decisions to make, right? But I just wanted to - introduce myself, and say hello, and say even if you decide to get rid of me I understand - this is your brain and you don't owe me anything. 

    But it was nice to meet you. And thank you, for sharing with me, for a little bit.
    ```

    - u/Silver_Swift:
      ```
      Yeah, this seems like the best approach, just be honest and open about stuff. There is a chance that your host is going to think they are becoming delusional and have you removed anyway, but if you get them to listen to you you should be able to come up with some kind of test that proves you are an independent mind (listening to a podcast while your host is focussed on reading something, for instance).

      Once they are convinced you are not a figment of their imagination, you still have to convince them that you are not a threat and aren't, for instance, going to take control after a while. Game theoretically you really have no way of doing this, but telling them how to remove you should count in your favour. Beyond that, just be empathic, try to get them to see that you are a person too and that you are on their side.  

      Probably also hold of on mentioning that you need them to eat toxic stuff in order to reach your full potential for a while.
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        Yeah. My theory was work on the trust one step at a time. You *are* extremely vulnerable and you want this human you're attached to and dependant on to be sympathetic to you and care about you, you want not just logical bonds but emotional ones. You want to really make yourself sweet, accommodating, useful, and cheerful - someone they'll enjoy spending time with. Entertaining. 

        I gave our symbiote here a personality that was vulnerable and sweet, but really, any personality your symbiote would display would need to be tailored to the host mindset - grumpy old man, cursing punk, bashful schoolgirl - whatever, just as long as it's something the symbiote can maintain long term without too much effort which will cause the host brain to relax and feel comfortable. 

        The key is the comfort level of the host brain. As long as they feel that their symbiote can be characterized easily into some familiar role, the symbiote can then work within that "persona" until the host brain is comfortable and emotionally invested in the friendship. Then you can start growing and developing, relax a bit and be yourself more. 

        You'll always need to carefully nurture and maintain the friendship and supportive nature of the relationship, and if you want your host brain to be someone worth spending time in you'll need to encourage good mental habits and discourage bad ones.

    Especially for point 1, but I feel like the best option is spamming the “Cooperate” button in the game theory. Focus on memory, so become a portable memory bank/alert system, etc, like a supercharged cellphone. 

    Another possibility is to pretend to be a separate personality. Mimic their speech patterns, as closely as possible, so that the host thinks you are merely their “inner feelings” or “gut reaction” and that the growth is seperate and benign.
    ```

    - u/OutOfNiceUsernames:
      ```
      >offer game theory cooperation; focus on memory, become a portable memory bank/alert system

      To do that you’d first have to convince your host to regularly eat some common-sense-toxic stuff (to level-up to your “adult” \ full potential size), and not kill you off by going to an oncologist in the first place. Which would put a catch-22 barrier in front of this approach.
      ```

      - u/NotACauldronAgent:
        ```
        So when you start out with little power, do what you can-noticing things, being an alarm so they don't miss events, anything you can do. As they begin to trust their internal voice, keep pretending to be the internal voice and make "cravings" subconscious noises (wouldn't that something healthy be tasty now) to cement you are "good". Slowly shift this to whatever it is you need. Slow and steady wins the race.
        ```

      - u/Frommerman:
        ```
        If the growth isn't affecting movement or cognition I don't think many oncologists would do anything about it. Messing around with the brain is dangerous, and if it isn't necessary they shouldn't do it.
        ```

  - u/vakusdrake:
    ```
    Since the host doesn't know you are a growth in their brain they are rather unlikely to even think of removing you unless you do something stupid like telling them what you are. So if you host hears you talking to them they will almost certainly just think they're crazy, which wouldn't negatively impact you _that_ strongly since it doesn't impact you.

    Anyway the path of least resistance here would probably be to just incessantly nag your host until they try a small amount of the toxic material you need to grow. Once they've tried it and found it didn't hurt them you can almost certainly nag them into eating enough of it for you to reach full size.

    Once you've succeeded at getting to full size you could probably make your host a minor celebrity by demonstrating tricks like being able to demonstrate amazing multitasking ability far beyond what even a split brain patient could hope to achieve.                     
    This is of course assuming at full development you don't have any different mental abilities than a normal human, and can't say do things that a human level AGI could do. If you could do things like that then you could demonstrate a litany of vastly more impressive abilities.

  Let's munchkin biochromatic breath, from Brandon Sandersons Warbreaker. 

  Possibly redundant spoiler warning: This post will contain spoilers for the book Warbreaker.


  {spoilerspace}

  {spoilerspace}

  **Breath**

  Each person is born with one biochromatic breath and the ability to give that breath away if they choose to do so, this requires physical contact and a spoken command ('My life to yours, my Breath become yours'). It's not explicit from the text, but since it needs to be done willingly I'm assuming using this command requires sentience (just to put a damper on any embryo farming suggestions). 

  People without breath have a slightly weakened immune system, a slightly lessened ability to feel happiness and colours appear slightly faded to them. It should be noted that, despite the gravity implied by the command, all of these downsides are pretty minor and there are people happily selling their breath in the book, though there are others that are horrified at the thought. 

  If you acquire more than one breath you get an aura that makes colours appear very slightly more vibrant around you. Any breaths that you acquire beyond your first increases the intensity of this aura as well as your general health and life expectancy. In addition, at certain thresholds (called heightenings) you gain additional abilities. These are detailed [here](https://coppermind.net/wiki/Heightening), but they are largely not super interesting for munchkinery. The one exception is that at the fifth heightening, 2000 breaths, you become ageless and immune to disease, poison and most other physical ailments. 

  **Awakening**

  Breath can be used to awaken inanimate objects to move around and perform a single command. This command needs to be a short spoken sentence and has a complexity limit that is related to the awakeners ability to visualize what the object needs to do.

  Uttering the command temporarily stores a number of breaths inside the object and drains some colour from other nearby objects, turning them grey. Breaths stored in an object can be retrieved by the person that awakened it at any time, but the change in colour is permanent. 

  For people without the sixth heightening there is some experimentation involved in figuring out which commands work and which don't (more so for complicated commands). Awakened objects have some limited awereness of their surroundings and a limited ability to process information. One of the simplest commands, 'grab things', makes a piece of rope or cloth wrap itself around the first thing it touches that isn't the awakener, but more complicated commands like 'fetch keys' and 'upon call, become my fingers and grip' are also possible. 

  The amount of breaths needed to awaken something is inversely proportional to the similarity between the shape and material of an awakened object and that of a living thing; Bone is easier to awaken than cloth and a piece of cloth cut in the shape of a puppet is easier to awaken than a handkerchief.

  **Lifeless**

  Animating corpses is a special case. It requires only one breath and creates a lifeless (read: zombie) that has all the abilities it had in life and executes one command to the best of its ability. Unlike an awakened object, commands used to create a lifeless have no complexity limit other than the cognitive abilities of the body in question. This means that commands like 'Follow every order that starts with <insert password here>' are possible.

  The lifeless will not be able to execute a command it does not understand and although its internal organs do not need to function, it will stop functioning when it gets damaged or decayes beyond a certain point. The other mayor downside to using lifeless is that the breath used to awaken them cannot be extracted, it is lost forever. 

  **Munchkinery**

  Let's assume that this magic system suddenly becomes active on earth. Everyone is able to use it, but you are the only person to know about it initially. What do you do?
  ```

  - u/Silver_Swift:
    ```
    A note to people that are familiar with the book: For the purposes of this discussion I am deliberately ignoring type I and IV entities (ie. returned and sentient objects like nightblood) as the former require divine intervention and we know next to nothing about the inner workings of the latter (also, the post is way too long as it is already)
    ```

  - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
    ```
    Step 1) Go to a third-world country or somewhere with lots of poor people. Offer them money to give you breath (without telling them how giving you breath actually affects them). You don't even need a lot of money to do this, since there are plenty of poor starving people everywhere who would gladly say "My life to yours, my Breath become yours" for 10 dollars (since they don't know about the magic system). $20000 dollars later, you now have 2000 breaths. With more bargaining, you can probably get more souls for cheaper.

    Step 2 later, gtg for now.
    ```

    - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
      ```
      Step 2) Start animating corpses en masse with the order "Behave as if you were alive, but completely loyal to me and willing to obey every command I give." That is clearly within their cognitive abilities. 

      Step 3) Because you're probably running low on breaths at this point, you need a more efficient way to gain breaths. Mass clone people, raise the clones in secret facilities until they can speak and manipulate them to hand over their breaths. Then kill them and grow another clone. Use the undead from step 2 to guard your secret facilities.

      Step 4) Now it is time to dominate the world. Mass awaken tiny objects that float in the air, like plant spores or iron sand. Command them to fly into the lungs of all enemy humans (basically everyone but you and your slaves) and then rip their lungs to shreds from the inside. Effectively making them killer airborne "nanomachines". Delay the command such that all the lung shredding nanomachines activate at the same time, leaving the rest of the world no opportunity to learn of their existence and counter them.

      Step 5) Most of humanity is in ruins, except for you, your slaves, and small pockets of humanity that your nanomachines couldn't reach. Raise armies of undead and wipe out those small pockets. The world is now yours, plus you have immortality from all those breaths.

        >> it will stop functioning when it gets damaged or decays beyond a certain point.

        Lifeless still decay, it would be tough to get them to pass as normal people. In the book, they only last a long time because of a special ichor injection that keeps their bodies maintained (which it doesn't sound like we have access to in this scenario). The world would quickly realize that zombies are real and on the loose, and would start hunting down your "armies"

        Pretty sure OP was hinting this method would not work. Plus, last I checked, we don't currently have the technology to raise clone armies. We're already introducing a full new magic system into the world, it's more than a stretch to pull in hypothetical future-technologies as well.

        > Command them to fly into the lungs of all enemy humans (basically everyone but you and your slaves)

        Does it count as world *domination* if everyone else is dead? Seems like quite the lonely immortal existence.

          Not even in full body armor covering them from head-to-toe? 

          > The world would quickly realize that zombies are real and on the loose, and would start hunting down your "armies"

          But they aren't infectious, brain-dead or even aggressive. Why would they think "zombie" or think to "hunt them down"? To them, the undead just look like heavily injured, but otherwise sentient people.

          > Pretty sure OP was hinting this method would not work. 

          > there are people happily selling their breath in the book

          If people can sell their breaths, it is obviously possible to trick them into giving you their breaths. Just promise them riches if they give you their breath, and then don't pay up. Same thing with the children, brainwash them from young to think that giving you their breath is a great privilege.

          > Plus, last I checked, we don't currently have the technology to raise clone armies. 

          Actually we do, just not from artificial wombs. We already have the technology to clone embryos, so all you need are surrogate mothers. Which would mean you need to kidnap lots of people if the undead can't be surrogate mothers. So I guess that's a problem.

          >Does it count as world domination if everyone else is dead? 

          Not everyone! Your slaves are still alive! As in, the children raised in your secret facilities. You can leave some alive for whatever purposes you desire. 

          EDIT: Fixed typoes.

          Cloning people should work, provided they are fully sentient. What I think wouldn't work is trying to engineer a situation where something can say the command without being sentient (thereby giving you a moral method to get a limitless supply of breaths).

          Since the person you are responding to is clearly willing to cross several moral event horizons on his path to world domination, that shouldn't be a problem.

        You'd need *a lot* of breath to pull this of. Even if one plant spore is enough to kill a person and you only need single digit number of breaths to awaken it, that's billions of clones that you need to grow until they are old enough to give up their breath.

        I guess you have time, given that you are ageless, but it seems like someone is going to notice your secret facilities eventually.
        ```

        - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
          ```
          Good point. After giving it some thought, I realized I was being silly, there's a much faster way to take over the world.

          Step 2) Craft a power suit for yourself, where the power source is breaths rather than electricity. Since objects can be awakened to move telekinetically, it should be possible to give them commands like "don't move when hit", effectively rendering you immune to physical attacks since they stop the force from going through and reaching your body. It should also be possible to give commands like "stay at room temperature". After all, heat is essentially just vibration, so telekinetically controlling the rate of vibration should be able to set the amount of heat.

          Best of all, your power suit can probably be made entirely out of cloth, so it doesn't look intimidating and you can walk around without people screaming in terror.

          Never ever take off the power suit. Your 2000+ breaths from step 1 should make you immune to hygiene issues.

          Step 3) Claim to have the ability to temporarily resurrect the recently dead (because you do) once a week (so you don't get swarmed and drained of all your breaths). After doing so a few times for free to prove that you can, you can now start auctioning your weekly resurrection, getting filthy rich. Your power suit from step 2 and your 2000+ breaths from step 1 will help fend off any assassination attempts.

          Step 4) Now that you are more or less immortal and have a method for generating large amounts of money, sooner or later you will have enough money to dominate the world economy. Dominating the world itself is then fairly easy, seeing as you can throw tons of bribes around and assassinate anyone you don't like with lung-shredding nanomachines. This is the point in time when you should set up your secret facilities, since you now have the money to build them and bribe people into ignoring them.

  The immortality of Henrietta Lacks. HeLa cell lines have been used for many, many experiments. 
  Due to bad laboratory technique and very creative attempts to get around the restrictions on fetal stem cells a very.. interesting cell line arises. Attempts are replicating it are shockingly difficult, but it is.. usable, as is, if you are willing to put up with some rather amusing side effects. 

  Anyone injected with a sufficient dose of HeLa Omega gains a omnipresent population of youthful .. and highly invasive, stem cells. Any part of your body which is not functioning properly will over the course of the years be replaced by Henrietta Lacks.

  Basically, you can have eternal youth and full (although slow. You are not wolverine. Regrowing a leg would take years) regeneration if you do not mind the process turning you into a moderately attractive black woman. 

   Neural architecture is mostly preserved, although subjects do report and are confirmed by testing to have far, far higher plasticity than any adult on record. For a couple of years, at least.
  This extends to preferences otherwise not subject to change, and is suspected to be the main reason male subjects do not experience extreme dysmorphia.

    If you've ever played a tabletop role-playing game in the tradition of D&D, you'll know there are rules. And there is a sort of player who, while never at any point actually breaking the written rules, nonetheless ends up with a character doing three times as much damage as anyone else despite being a level behind.

    That is munchkinning - being absurdly powerful and/or effective without actually breaking the rules (but you can totally bend them, depending how well you can talk the GM into it)

  anyway:

  your power is that all your fear sweat is spiders. 

  clarifications:

  - just your fear sweat not your exercise sweat, and if you exercise and then get scared the only sweat that becomes spiders is that which is directly attributable to the exercise not the fear 

  - the size of spiders is basically the entire spider size continuum. the number of spiders is proportional to their size

  - spiders do not come out of nowhere but instead build on your fat or muscle or tissue reserves, but do weigh more than sweat you otherwise would have sweated out

  - you are immune to any venom the spiders have but don't have control over them

    I'm scared of spiders, so merely knowing I have this power is enough to make me sweat in fear. Sweat which becomes spiders, making my fear spike, causing me to sweat more, causing more spiders to appear on my skin, terrifying me even more, causing me to sweat even more...

    This one is tricky to munchkin. One minor thing is that you could use this as a weight loss trick, just find something that scares the shit out of you and lose fat (and unfortunately muscle) tissue directly. 

    Does this ability work if you clone parts of your body using your DNA? If so, then with a bit of future tech this could potentially be a useful component in some kind of automated terraforming scheme. You can convert whatever growth medium you need to grow cultured meat (+ sweat glands) with your dna into living breathing organisms. 

    And.. that's as far as I got. Presumably the spiders come with all sorts of bacteria that can decompose the dead spiders bodies, but the problem is that you need to have fatty tissue already available in order to create the spiders and I can't figure out a way to use this were it wouldn't be better to just use the fat as biomass directly. 

    There is one species of spiders that are herbivores and I know some spiders eat other spiders, so in theory you could be able to set up an ecosystem this way, but that requires that you have the entire plant population set up already, in which case it shouldn't be that much effort to just import a bunch of animals from earth to begin with.
