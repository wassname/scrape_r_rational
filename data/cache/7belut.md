  off the top of my head:

  google maps. Can provide extremely valuable accurate cartography to settlers, engineers, and military.  Lewis and Clark should have a much easier time.  Gold deposits can be predicted and discretely mined prior to the rush. 

  How it's made wikis. kick off industrial revolution early a la Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court.  major advances in mathematics and medicine are easy short term gains that can build notoriety and credibility. 

  Unlimited battery means I could set up a system to pull power out of the phone and provide free energy for my [magical floating super city.](http://bioshock.wikia.com/wiki/Columbia)

  oh, and if I live that long, once he's born invite Nikola Tesla to come live in my techno-paradise and rule the world with his mad science schemes.

    On the other hand, you probably only get a few amps at no more than 24 volts, and try as you might, you can't get any more. Yes it's free, but you could get more with a pedal powered generator.

    Also, why is your goal automatically uplift?

      it's true, the Columbia thing was a joke ;) though you might be able to bootstrap some other higher output systems if you are patient.  

      >Also, why is your goal automatically uplift?

      why not? I'm a futurist.  I believe if we can jump start the race for strong AI and I can set humanist foundations for it by counteracting the puritan regression and anti-intellectualism that took hold around that time, we'd be seeing a post-scarcity world much sooner. 

      Even from a purely selfish standpoint, the above would help put me in a position of relative power and luxury.

        ... you might want to study history.

        > we'd be seeing a post-scarcity world much sooner.

        If you want to jumpstart the AI revolution, your best bet will be to cross your fingers and hope you aren't in a separate timeline. Using your internet access, set up a communication loop with the future, and use the loop to brute force solutions to difficult problems. Like the FAI one. Eventually you'll want to solve the time-travel problem, too, and then you're laughing.

        Without time-travel hacks, you'll be able to uplift to early-mid 21st century technology, at best. In this case, your best bet will be to figure out how the phone is communicating with the internet: it's either technological or magical, and either one means hacks.

        And to be fair, figuring out how the unlimited battery works could also mean hacks.
        ```

        - u/SignoreGalilei:
          ```
          How unlimited is this battery? Like if I destroy it does the phone grow a new one? If it shorts out galaxy note-style do you get an eternal flame? Those could get you some decent entry level entropy hacks.
          ```

        - u/crivtox:
          ```
          Using  time loops to brute force dificult things is dangerous ,you are basically creating an outcome pump that searches a future where you stopped the loop, and usually "do not mess with time "stile solutions are easier to find than how to solve ai safety,  for example you die before starting the time loop, or you become convinced that you solved fai without actualy doing it.

          I'm referring to the second Great Awakening and Restoration in the US (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Christianity_in_the_United_States#19th_century) that undid a lot of the skeptical and rational culture changes that were underway across europe and the colonies (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment).  

          Jefferson and other intellectuals of the time were Deists, for instance, and there was a broad support for science and rationality around the turn of the century that was slowly pushed back by growing anti-intellectual Christian movements.   However, care would need to be taken that the Abolitionist origins in many faith circles weren't snuffed out along with the evangelicism.
          ```

- u/ben_oni:
  ```
  The first task is to figure out how this internet access from the 19th century works. See if I can communicate with the future. Can I make major changes to the past, or is it basically inflexible?

  My ultimate goal here will be to gain access to this time travel technology. I don't really understand what happened, but I'm hopeful that I can figure things out.
  ```

  - u/wren42:
    ```
    that's a good point - the real answer if I'm being literal and not following the spirit of the question is likely "question the metaphysics of this reality."  I've just discovered I'm either insane, being manipulated or living in a simulation.  First priority is probably attempt communication with whoever is messing with me ;)
    ```

- u/ben_oni:
  ```
  After thinking about this scenario a bit, I realize I'd rather see someone do the harder version:

  You are a native of the early 19th century, and have come across a modern-day smartphone with internet access, unlimited battery, and is not locked. The original owner appears to have died tragically. Initially you don't know what this device is, or how it works, but eventually you discover that it responds to the name "Okay Google", and is able to display cat pictures. What do you do from there?
  ```

  - u/CCC_037:
    ```
    ...I imagine this could very well end up with the smartphone either smashed or at the centre of a shrine to Okay Google the cat deity.
    ```

- u/amoetodi:
  ```
  I plummet haphazardly into the bushes. The town I live in has been around for at least 500 years, so I'm two minutes away from the town centre, and a couple of miles away from where my ancestors lived. I'd go find them, because that seems like a laugh. So now I'm in central Scotland during the Scottish enlightenment. I'll go invent electronics and chill out with the cool 19th century rationalist community that was big at the time. I can understand Scots well enough to communicate, I don't think that would be too much of an issue. I'd probably do okay for myself.
  ```

- u/VorpalAuroch:
  ```
  Inconveniently I am in Mountain View, which was not incorporated for another century. The San Francisco mission exists, but I'm still in Spanish territory and will be until Mexican independence in 20 years. I don't speak Spanish, and my English will make me stand out. I will also be mistaken for Jewish, which is not illegal in Spanish territory at this time but not convenient. Travel will be difficult.

  My best bet is probably to jump-start the Gold Rush. If I can find maps of the biggest deposits/the areas owned by those who made the most money, I can probably do reasonably well and get infrastructure flowing in. Unfortunately this would probably also produce war and totally upend the political history of North America, since war with Spain in the 1810s would probably make the history of Mexico completely different, and possibly derail Manifest Destiny and the political unity of the USA, so the Civil War might not happen. On the plus side, this means that I would have a comparatively early way to check Wikipedia and see if my effects on the future are changing the internet I see.

    . Well not with *your* future. That would be broken. You are obviously in a new branch of time/ancestor sim, with some kind of cross-time bullshit tethering your phone to your origin time frame.

  When you start out, that phone will be the single most valuable object on Earth. You're going to want to keep it secret until you're powerful enough to protect it. Never take it out unless you're alone, preferably at night, with no chance of anyone walking in on you looking into a mysterious light square. You'll be doing a *lot* of nighttime reading. 

  You probably don't have any 1800s dollars on you, so first thing would probably be to work a few hours washing dishes or sweeping floors. Once you have a seed, it's off to whichever racetracks have the best historical records in the area. Gotta move around a lot and start small so nobody clues in to the fact that you're a time traveler. 

  Now that you have a little nest egg built up, start investing. Just like before, spread your investments out and go through middlemen. At this point you should probably hire bodyguards, you're going to get rich fast. 

  Once you've backed the inventors of the steam engine, cotton gin, lightbulb, etc. (or maybe invented one or two of these yourself, if you like crafts) you'll be firmly set up as a magnate and power player in your city. Now you can start looking at historical USGS data and buying up parcels of land with valuable deposits. Stay away from oil, it won't be valuable for long. 

  Congratulations, your name is now spoken in the same sentences as Rothschild and Vanderbilt! You can start your own mining/manufacturing industry now. I recommend starting with solar power and communications. Tesla won't come around for another few decades, so you can shamelessly steal the idea of the electric car, and make sure it takes this time. 

  It should only take a few years for you to become Earth's wealthiest and most-loved individual. Quality of life has skyrocketed thanks to you, and this 'internet' thing is so much fun! Appoint your most trusted advisers to run your factories and server farms, it's time to go stop colonialism. 

  Regrettably, the British East India Company already has its hooks in the subcontinent, but the real damage hasn't yet begun. Buy the Company. Research where the most valuable tea, ink, silk, etc. come from, go make fair trade deals with those populations. 

  You'll have to do a lot of micromanaging in Europe to make sure they don't sink their teeth into India and Africa. You could do this by going to those places and giving them the technology to fend off incursion, but the whole point is to let them develop on their own, so maybe just give them medical technology and outbid anyone who wants to set up trade. Up to you and how valuable you think Western ideals are. Definitely give everyone solar and comms. 

  The greatest catastrophes of the 19th century have been averted and you're by far the most powerful human alive, so now you can do pretty much what you like. You might kill Hitler's parents, but we're approaching a post-scarcity society, so Communism probably never arises for the National Socialists to fight. It might be fun to start the UN a century earlier and then try to unify the world under your rule, but that's a lot of responsibility, and things are going pretty smoothly worldwide at this point. Honestly I recommend appointing someone to do that while you build Xanadu and work on making sure your favorite authors and artists are born (and if not, on recreating their masterworks). 

  You've given humanity a 200-year shortcut, minus all the pollution and exploitation! Regrettably this doesn't give you immortality, but put your best medical researchers and CS folks on the case. You for sure have access to the best medical technology around, so pump your labs full of cash and hope 2 centuries was enough of a boost.

  I'm at a good place for a city, but almost 100 years early.  The first thing I would do is try to get to the nearest HBC fort, (found via maps and Wikipedia),  then try to get East far enough to reach a city (probably Winnipeg or Ottawa).  Set myself up as an academic, and trade technology for a good standard of living while simultaneously advancing Canada as a world power.

  Real glad I'm on the first floor in a city founded well before 1800. I'm a few months late to invent the battery, but assuming this means "January 1 1800" I can still scoop electrolysis by a few months to get myself noticed by the scientific community. Having enough clout now not to be immediately dismissed as a crackpot, I can hopefully explain my situation to the scientific community and get continued living expenses paid while we work out how to implement inventions from the future.

      Well, if I get in the same altitude I'll fall to death but at least If civilization survives they will have a  unlimited battery to power them in the heath death of the universe.
      Otherwise I will have to get more information on the internet  about local history and some basic information that i would need   to survive and not seem suspicious( first ask other people on the internet what information is more important) .

      Then I would try to get a place to stay and a job, or figure out how to get at least food and water.

      Depending on the situation impressing someone which my magic glowing rectangle that only I can use can  be a good idea or a terrible one depending on cirscunstance  .

       Once I have time and safety ask on the internet  for ideas of what to do disguised as hypothetical scenarios,( maybe say that in writing a story about a time traveler to the 1800 and ask people for ideas and info to make it more  realistic).

      My phone gives me insane  math superpowers  , so figure out how munch of my awesome computing  power I can let people know and what kinds of jobs I can get whith that( I'm actually really interested in that , maybe I'll propose a similar thing but whith only a calculator and no memories of future tech in the next Saturday munchkinism thread ).

      I live  in Spain so I'll have to ensure I leave the country in a few years.

      I'll investigate what happened to me in my original timeline to search for clues.

      It would be awesome if I could prove that I time traveled   to the people of my time and therefore  get help from a ton of experts  , but it's unlikely that I will be able to convince people.But convincing people from the  year 1800  is easier given that I don't lose mi phone.

       On the long term my goal is triying to uplift civilization as munch as posible, and try to make people more interested on x risk prevention and life extension, and If I can get rudimentary cryonics before I die better( but I don't think I would be able to improve tech that munch), and improve civilization in general .

  Not only does my city not exist, but nobody who speaks a language resembling any of the ones I speak to any degree of fluency lives within several thousand kilometres. 

  Fortunately there are Noongar dictionaries online, so I can use those as a starting point for communication and pick up on the language within a year or so.

  I think realistically I'd try to integrate with whichever local tribal group would have me. I don't really see the point in trying to do an Uplift, but I'll use my knowledge and internet access to the best of my ability to make our lives easier. Realistically it won't really change much because of the lack of infrastructure.

  The first British settlers come in 1830 so I'll probably still be alive when that happens. That'll be trippy for them. I'll offer some suggestions. I work in road design so I'll probably advise them to leave nice big road reserves, and I'll tell them about the gold desposits inland. See if I can meet up with a scientist who has access to industrial methods and work out how to accellerate technology.

  Realistically though I guess my main hope is for an idyllic hunter-gatherer lifestyle, which I know is far from actually existed in reality. With some googling I might have access to some climate records from 1800s and be able to predict droughts and stuff, maybe.

  Step thr - no, step *one and a half*, climb a tree. I should be able to see the (much smaller) city from up there, and it probably won't be more than three or four days' hike away.

  ...I'll need water, eventually. I can see a river from up in my tree. Food will be trickier, I'll have to find an ally, perhaps in the city... I can certainly 'invent' stuff to pay my way...

- u/PretentiousSmirk:
  ```
  I get whatever work I can, live life quietly and try to avoid getting lynched or something (black). I get married and have kids and tell them my story along with where to find me in 2017. They tell their kids and so on until that version of me receives a letter from me  telling him to seriously arm up the day of the time jump. 

  2nd me comes back seconds after I got there seriously armed and while I'm impressed, I become somewhat used to it as more me's start pouring in with weapons, food, and various materials, basically stuff previous versions of me realized we can't replicate even with smartphone research. Eventually more meds stop showing up. Changing the future as much as we're going to means I'm probably not born in this universe.

  My army of me sets up camp near an area we can mine for precious metals (smartphone research) and sends out squads to rescue slaves and bring them to my little proto-country. They'll be free citizens but they'll have to swear allegiance to the grand council of Me's. We're friendly enough but we're also basically a Me-worshipping cult. Better than being slaves though right? With the added labor of folks with actual farming experience, the money we can make from mining, and our overwhelming military might, the U.S. has no choice but to let us keep one of their states as our own separate country. A few groups of me stay in America as citizens. They bet on pretty much anything they can research and start businesses/ investing in profitable businesses. Eventually their families get rich enough to bribe politicians and sometime in the mid to late 1900s the U.S. cedes more land/territories to its newest and most terrifying ally. 

  After that, the focus is bringing all of our resources to bear to find the source of my one-time time jump in the first place. Assuming that can be accomplished, we send squads of indoctrinated citizen-soldiers led by versions of me (plucked from the 1800s) back to different points in time to sew themselves into various seats of power. The me's won't be at the forefront for obvious reasons, but I only trust myself to keep my cult in line. 

  By 2017 every world leader has agreed to make me (whichever members of the collective got to make it back to the future) their God-Kings and we mostly just use the power to park free and impress hot chicks at bars.
