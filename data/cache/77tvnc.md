## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

    This seems more like a problem of how to find trustworthy people, rather than a problem of how to munchkin a superpower.

    That said, there are of course, ways to reduce the number of trustworthy people needed. You said the first power is Flight? That's relatively useless, just get on a damn plane. Discharge that, and all other relatively useless powers, on terminally ill patients and death row convicts that are about to be executed. That way, they can't backstab you, because they are dead. Then, when you get an actually useful power, you can give it to one of the few trustworthy people you have found.

    And if you can't find any trustworthy people, there's always the option of kidnapping. You wouldn't be able to give the kidnapped victims any combat-related superpowers of course, since they would be able to use those powers to break free. Instead, give them oracle-like superpowers, superpowers that give them supernatural methods of gaining information, and then make them tell you the information.

  In a desperate attempt to promote equality, a mad scientist/alien/wizard/god/whatever has made it so that every day, at 12 pm GMT, all humans on Earth swap bodies randomly.

  This swap does not allow people to gain memories/knowledge: for example, if a physicist is put into the body of a biologist, he still retains all of his knowledge of physics, and does not gain any of the biologist's knowledge. 

  This swap does not change the location of any physical mass: when the physicist wakes up in the biologist's body, that body is still where the biologist left it, not where the physicist's body originally was.

  This swap is not instantaneous: all humans lose consciousness for 30 minutes at 12pm GMT, and wake up at 12:30pm in someone else's body. So there is no faster than light signaling.

  If a body dies during the swap (before 12:30pm), the current owner dies. Any prospective owners find other bodies to swap with.

  What does the resulting world look like? Is there anything that rational agents could do to mitigate negative effects?

      To /u/DeterminedThrowaway and /u/ulyssessword: Long-term coordination isn't entirely ruled out, since knowledge isn't gained via swaps. This means you could set up passwords to identify one another... I think? 

      But hmm... perhaps this scenario is too sudden for anyone to do anything. Let's relax the problem a little: what if you knew, 10 years in advance, that this swapping phenomenon would occur? Is there anything you could do to prepare for it?

        I'm assuming I know the exact date this will start. I would try to set up the following: a well-stocked, well-provisioned refuge area for 200000 people with maximally failproofed automation, greenhouses, etc.  I start some sort of organization (probably a cult) and I need to get it to >200000 young, healthy members (order of square root of the global population to make it so that one of the cult members ends up in the area on each of the first several days). All the cult members go to the refuge the day of the transition.

        In the area, there is some way for anyone who knows the layout and secret passwords to get to the control center, whence he can make announcements, view people on cameras, and perform selective automated executions to punish defectors. There is also an automatic announcement that plays at 12:30 in the 10 most common global languages with instructions to not panic, follow loudspeaker instructions, warns them they are being watched and can be punished, etc.

        This can help guarantee survival of the bodies inside at a much higher rate than outside. After a short time, I expect world population to plummet, meaning that more and more of the people in the refuge have been there before, allowing them to form some sort of society.

        Once a significant portion of the world population is in the refuge each day, we set up identifying passwords. We organize people to sleep in such a way that whoever wakes up in a certain bed is in charge, there are standard lines of communication, etc. in order to quickly organize each morning. I'll have the cult members be in on the plan so that there will be somebody who can organize all this.

        This way, we can probably get a 100000 person strong surviving population and society, enough to serve as a nucleus for future humanity.

        Edited: spellng

        Further edit with new idea:
        Actually, the faster the world population declines, the faster we get people returning to the refuge regularly and the faster we can organize society inside (and have more people survive inside). Therefore the cult members will be ordered to kill people, damage infrastructure, etc. whenever they wake up outside to whatever extent they can without risk to themselves in order to speed up the process.

        The immediate scenario will very quickly lead to a global collapse in population - mainly due to the fact that food production is going to almost completely vanish.

        But with ten years to prepare for it, it becomes a lot more survivable. What needs to happen:

        - Global literacy. Everyone needs to be able to read.
        - Instructions. Everyone needs to wake up with a notebook, describing how to do basic maintenance tasks on whatever infrastructure that body is responsible for. (Advanced maintenance, or improvements, will have to wait on a mind that actually knows what it's doing).
        - Interpersonal relationships will be mostly long-range, over email.
        - At best, this will merely slow the decline of humanity. Children will *not* benefit from the constant swapping, and education will be near impossible. For small (pre-literate) children, even interpersonal relations will be practically impossible. Humanity *will* be able to adapt, but it will take generations and our social systems will come out completely altered in ways hard to predict.
        ```

    If humanity is not warned in advance then we are seriously screwed. At 12PM in the first day everybody that's driving, flying a plane, participating on a surgery, etc., dies horribly. Maybe 5% to 30% of the people die. We probably lose 50% of working drivers/pilots and that's enough to break down our entire logistics system.

    After that we have billions of people suddenly gaining conscience inside bodies they aren't familiar with, doing things they don't understand. We have a decent chance of a catastrophic failure in some system because the operator has no idea how to deal with emergencies. Software starts breaking down because any production system problem that doesn't have 100% automated failure recovery won't be fixed (even if the swapped person happens to have the particular skill set they probably won't be familiar with the system and won't know the passwords). As the systems die we increase the chances of a snowball effect as more and more systems that depend on then fail. After a few hours of downtime in core systems other systems suddenly fail because they're now handling a situation that never happened before and that part of the (never run before) code has some bugs. Not all systems die, but enough of them and many of the key systems die, it's probably sufficient to "shut down the internet".

    If the swap is random chances are people can't talk to each other as they speak different languages. Age differences are a big deal too, much bigger than gender differences. Body sizes may be a big problem if you keep your original motor skills.

    Maybe after a week most of the survivors adapted to the daily shuffle but now humanity is facing an extinction event. Cities have two weeks of food supplies and nobody is delivering more food.

    Arguably selection effects kill everybody that isn't super competent and compassionate, It's very probable that at least one large (> 10k) population group will persist due to randomness, so we may keep a minimum viable population for breeding. From then on it's a survivable situation, human culture and values are changed beyond recognition but the civilization that emerges from our ashes will colonize the solar system in a few centuries, as their coordination skills will be godlike.

    >What does the resulting world look like?

    Horrible.  

    Any mind with major problems (or simply being a baby) would leave a chain of ruined bodies and situations in its wake, and any body with major problems (allergies, any sort of medication, etc.) would die very quickly.  Any simply selfish person would leave sleepy, injured, and/or hungry bodies behind.

    All farms, specialized infrastructure, and complex systems fail practically instantly, as everyone who runs them ends up on the far side of the world.  They can't do their jobs, and nobody else even knows that they should be doing them.

    The only possible way of punishing criminal (or civil) acts is to kill someone before the next swap.

    Trade becomes almost impossible and useless.  You can only use enough to get you through one day, and you can only gather resources that quickly as well.  You also can't enter contracts with people that last longer than 23:30, and even if you could, you couldn't enforce them.

    Communication is difficult, but not impossible.  A unified world language would likely emerge almost instantly to deal with the random mishmash of languages that any group of people would speak.

    Jetlag would suck, but it's possible people would synchronize to some consistent offset.  

    >Is there anything that rational agents could do to mitigate negative effects?

    Not much.  They can't coordinate with collaborators for longer than 23 hours, and can't affect defectors other than by killing them.  It's like playing a non-iterated version of the prisoner's dilemma: the defect-bot has the winning strategy.

  You gain access to an inert, synthetic, humanoid body. It's made of a kind of metal for all tests humanity knows of, but it has weird properties.

  If you chop off a hand from that body and attach to a person with a missing hand it will bond and act as a perfect prosthetic hand. The humanoid body will grow a new hand (say a gram per second out while it can draw carbon from the surrounding air).

  The prosthetic will heal itself, a bit over 1g per hour. It also will replace the neighboring body cells in a Theseus' ship fashion, at the same rate, so in roughly seven years a person will be entirely replaced but preserve identity. From them on the person is functionally immortal, full body destruction still is possible and if you lose parts of your brain it'll grow back but the associated memories will be lost forever. The material is roughly as strong as some decent plastic. Besides the durability/health benefits your body/mind functions are unchanged.

  Only the original synthetic body can produce attachable parts, once a part is attached to a person it can't be cut and bound to other people (it'll slowly form a clone of the person at the 1g per hourish rate, but the clone will develop as a new human, so it starts as a baby and needs to acquire it's own set of skills/memories and is biologically 21yo after seven years).

  What would you do in such scenario?
  ```

  - u/Kinoite:
    ```
    I'd worry that the slow transformation would lead to some ironic fate worse than death.  So, I probably wouldn't do anything without lots and lots of research.

    But, if that's not a concern, and it really is just a novel material, then I'd start looking for the minimum viable graft.

    Replace a freckle or something.  And then, in 7 years, end up with an immortal body.

    Is there a reason  (other than ironic fates worse than death) to not go for plastic immortality?
    ```

  - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
    ```
    I would be extremely worried about it, seeing as it literally takes over human bodies. How do we know it isn't overwriting their personalities or doing some kind of evil possession? 

    But, assuming that isn't the case, first question: do you need to replace an entire hand? If I replace say, a fingernail or a hair or a patch of skin, can the "prosthetic" still take over the human body and grant functional immortality? If so, you can just start giving out "prosthetics" en masse, turning all of humanity functionally immortal.

    Second question: the synthetic body heals itself using the carbon in the air. Can this heal rate be accelerated by filling the air with MORE carbon? What if we just dunk the entire thing in a vat of pure carbon?

    Third question:

    >  (it'll slowly form a clone of the person at the 1g per hourish rate, but the clone will develop as a new human, so it starts as a baby and needs to acquire it's own set of skills/memories and is biologically 21yo after seven years).

    Oh shit oh shit oh shit what have we done? How much needs to be cut off to become a clone? Because we humans are always losing parts of our bodies here and there, hairs, skins, nails, body fluids, etc. If they all become clones, we are going to face the worst overpopulation crisis ever.
