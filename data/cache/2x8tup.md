## [BST] If wizards are normal, why did someone create muggles?

### Post:

I have a good, solid magic system for a setting.  To play by the rational rules, though, it requires that human brains run off magic, not masses of neurons.  I'm willing to go with that.

Now, let's say that you want to use this magic system in an HP(MoR)-like setting, where wizards are living parallel to the modern muggle world in secret.  It's impossible that muggle science wouldn't have noticed that brains run on magic - it has big, obvious testable consequences.  So muggle brains have to still run on masses of neurons, which cannot possibly have occurred naturally.  It would be too huge of a coincidence for there to be basically the same people with two completely different brain structures.

The best way to make sense of this would be if someone, at some long-forgotten point in the past, went and made a very low-magic environment that contains humans and animals that run on neurons.  Muggles are so much like real people because someone very much intentionally did that.

And that's where I'm stuck - what motivation could this person possibly have had?

  If there exists a phenomenon that is antithetical to magic, such that Wizards and magical creatures find themselves *dead* when they encounter it, Muggles would have been created by past Wizards as a way to have people that can survive that.

  If that phenomenon is spreading, Wizards may in fact be an endangered species.

      They would also be immune to any big bad's thaumic mind control, an ability that seems very feasible in this setting.

        Yeah, I went through all the effort making a setting where mental magics make coherent sense, it would be a shame not to use lots of it.

        For any given mentally-affecting spell, the muggle-affecting version is a completely different incantation and substantially harder to cast, if it even exists.  It does seem like an obliviate equivalent would have to exist, though, just out of practical consideration.

          If you wanted, you could also have his motivation be that he wanted some way to fight even against something that nullified magic.  Since the muggles can't use magic and therefore can't rely on it for anything, as well as still wanting effective weapons, they would necessarily create weapons that didn't need magic to operate

  They wanted to create a subordinate underclass of laborers and menial-task-doers. Their lack of magic would mean that they would have a hard time threatening their master's position. 

  Maybe it was just one guy and he only wanted a small cadre of slaves to carry him around in a palanquin or something. Unfortunately, a few ran away at some point. Before he knew it the fucking things were everywhere. Muggles are an invasive species.

  - u/OffColorCommentary:

    I enjoy the invasive species angle, but otherwise this is a little too common an explanation, and doesn't quite perfectly fit the evidence.

    It's absolutely good enough to use as a red-herring hypothesis though.

  Tell me how magic came to be. Humans have neurons because natural selection; why is there magic? You'll have to explain animals too. It makes more sense to say that Wizards *without* neurons are deviations rather than the people *with* neurons, because the people more closely resemble what you would expect from a species descended from higher primates.

  Unless you're saying that all animals are deviations from magical animals, in which case I propose that the person who did this was a scientist who wanted to see if he could devise either life or a computational system that didn't run on magic, so he xeroxed some people and gave them prototype brains of different sorts, entirely different from the positronic stuff that Wizards apparently have. Then he died, and his experiments (unfinished) fulfilled their programming to procreate (programming which he added so that the experiment to propagate and refine itself).

  We need more details!

  - u/OffColorCommentary:

    >Unless you're saying that all animals are deviations from magical animals

    I am.  Magic is the default.

    The universe has two classes of matter - thaums and atoms.  Atoms behave as they do in our universe.  Thaums are invisible, intangible^(*), golf ball-sized objects with mental properties.  There is such a thing as an anger thaum, or a sadness thaum, and while it would take several different types of intelligence thaums to create a mind we'd recognize, it's not a huge number.  Thaums gently push each other away, but can get stuck in atomic matter.  They apply small amounts of forces to atomic matter, as strategically as they can (one thaum is not smart), to accomplish whatever they're trying to do.  This makes animism right-ish.

    Real animals evolved with thaums in them.  Real brains are organs that are good at containing thaums, and they contain mostly sensor neurons, which pick up the small amounts of force that thaums can produce and send them to motor neurons in the body.  This would show up blatantly on an MRI.  Real brains also respond to brain damage differently than ours.

    So, at some point, someone (more likely a group of someones) sectioned off a large chunk of the planet and removed most of the thaums there.  They built all-neuron brains for the replacement animals and people that would live there.  They also went to the trouble of folding space so that the sectioned off part of the planet would look like a spheroid.

    But it seems like too specific a group of things to do just for "to see if we can."

    ^(*) But we don't go down the invisible-dragon-in-my-basement rabbit hole; they're easier to detect than atoms turned out to be.

      Oh, I'm actually more interested than this. So what, the earth is actually flat, or something, and goes on "forever", but the section of earth that non-magical people and animals inhabit has some crazy space-folding magic on it that makes it appear spherical.
      ```

      - u/OffColorCommentary:
        ```
        Oh, less interesting than that, I'm afraid.  I was thinking the world is actually a significantly larger spheroid.  The planet ends up sphere-like unless we start throwing out a lot more of the laws of physics than I want to.

        The problem with the Harry Potter model is that if you get there by folding real locations, it would be clearly detectable by now, and if you get there by creating pocket dimensions, then why are *wizards* the ones living in the second-class topological spaces?  It's certainly possible to do a larger-scale folding that makes the new surface have the right shape to be consistent with physical laws, and leaves the majority of space for wizards, but that's a very specific thing to do.  I needed an explanation for why they'd pick that way (and I have one now).

        I've been working with some exotic coordinate systems in my day job lately, so the true laws of topology are probably going to be something quite byzantine, because I can, but I haven't picked a structure yet.

  What are the calorie requirements of magic? If being non-magical is more metabolically efficient, then it would make sense for muggles (or nonmagical variants) to evolve under the right circumstance.

  Conversely, if magic can get you free energy in the physical universe, why haven't fast breeding magical grey goo (or I guess green goo if it evolved from algae) spread to everything and consumed all other forms of life?

  > intelligence thaums

  Are intelligence thaums scarce or otherwise limited?  The limit on certain kinds of thaums could have acted as a hard cap on various species' population's ability to grow larger.  Thus, the non-thaumic or scarce thaumic variants would have a strong evolutionary advantage for a species that was reaching the limit on rare thaums types.  This would also provide intermediate advantages as rare thaums became scarcer.

  Edit: Reread main post and realized you are prioritizing explanations with the creation being intentional.  The scarcity of higher intelligence thaums might still apply.  Some wizard realized that the population of magical intelligent beings would be limited by the number of intelligence thaums and decided to create a non-magical form of intelligent life to get around this.
  ```

  - u/OffColorCommentary:
    ```
    > Are intelligence thaums scarce or otherwise limited?

    I wasn't planning on that.  As-written, the main evolutionary advantage of humans was brains that were able to get a critical mass of thaums in one place, not a way to gather the exact right ones.  Note that thaums only weakly interact with matter, and repel one another, so this is still an evolutionary feat.

    I think sufficiently scarce thaums would have even bigger impacts on how evolution turned out than the above.  Though I guess the most obvious one is just that wizards eat lots of brains for nutrition, which isn't THAT weird.

    > Some wizard realized that the population of magical intelligent beings would be limited by the number of intelligence thaums and decided to create a non-magical form of intelligent life to get around this.

    This actually fits a lot of the same evidence that would go with what /u/RandomDamage suggested.  And the similarity of the two theories predict is extremely handy for me.

    > Conversely, if magic can get you free energy in the physical universe, why haven't fast breeding magical grey goo (or I guess green goo if it evolved from algae) spread to everything and consumed all other forms of life?

    In the real world, green goo DID successfully colonize almost the entire surface of the planet and displace almost all other life.  And it did this by "breaking" conservation of energy by getting energy from off-planet via photosynthesis.

    I don't see small-scale violations of conservation of energy having a very different impact.  However, larger-scale violations could be disastrous, which is, again, extremely handy for me.

  the way you explain them. thaums are akin to a soul, semisentient puppeteer parasites, and magic interfaces. maybe some ancient think tank(ha!) discovered thaums have a half life, they decay and maybe the process is accelerating with magic use? anyway they panic. after the panic some begin searching for a way to reverse that but others see the futility. hoping to preserve higher forms of life and sentience from the imminent collapse they begin with project "roundworld" as a corralled off section of the planet to test their replacements. neurons are pretty much one of the first avenues of research as normal humans have them to interpret thaum imput. the project takes years and complete generations of researchers  and eventually is forgotten as its purpose is lost or simply left to progress on its own until the barrier collapses on near thaum depletion. instead of a full collapse it becomes instead porous earlier than expected letting some muggles wander off reservation and start communities while letting wizards in sometimes.  :D

    also it would be fun for thaums to decay into atoms XD

  The meat-brains are the result of a catastrophic invasion by the necromancer Carl. Meat, unlike Thaumic Intelligence, can be directly reanimated with almost no loss of effectiveness!

  Essentially, neuron-based humans are the remains of a global necromantic invasion. The invasion failed, but they breed so damn fast that the meatids are now the dominant life form.

  I would expect an enormously extended conflict, followed by eventual tolerance, but with significant remaining species prejudice. I would want to run a game during that global conflict; wizards fighting a desperate battle against the enormous militarized meatid race. But if your plans call for peaceful coexistence, you could just place the setting a few thousand years later, and let the events fade into mythology.

  Edited, now that you've explained a bit more about your setting.

  What are the drawbacks of magic? The purpose of muggles could be to have beings with an incentive to find the ramifications of the laws of physics and exploit them, resulting in technology that gets around magic's limitations. Wizards then wouldn't be reliant on casting spells for everything. Naturally, wizards would keep the existence of magic a secret; after all, how could muggles figure out the laws of physics if they were regularly being violated? Over time, the wizards could possibly have forgotten their project's original purpose, along with the reason for their tradition of secrecy.
  ```

- u/Nepene:
  ```
  Suppose certain types of matter arrangement repel magic. Atoms in the right orientation push it away, granting something resistance to magic. 

  A wizard discovers this and tries to weaponize the process. They section off a portion of the planet, build a number of simple lifeforms, and cast a mass death spell over the planet. They accelerated time.

  This spell isn't 100% effective. It isn't fast. But if an organism has thaums this spell uses that magic to kill them slowly.

  Over time the organisms with the most resistance to magic became dominant. Generations of organisms with atomic arrangements that repelled thaums arose.

  Every now and then the mage checked in. At times they tweaked an organism, sometimes they modified something. 

  Billions of years later, their creation was complete. Sentient, extremely magic resistant organisms, some of them intelligent, ready to be used against an enemy.

  The original mage had vanished, the time speeding spell long since faded. And slowly the magic that held apart the worlds was breaking apart...

  Hmmm... An old idea I had - probably won't work in your universe, but maybe it'll help you think of something - was a class of spells that destroyed anything that relied on changing to convey information, in a universe where living things had mild AT-field-like strengths. Rocks could break, and paper could burn, but a genetically-engineered subspecies storing information was priceless.

  Even without those metaphysics, you could have Muggles be created as a form of information storage that tries to preserve itself.

  If you make mind-reading easy against wizards, Muggles might have been meant to be spies who could securely communicate/ act.

  You could literally just make the motivation for science - I've seen people suggest that once we know how to make human-intelligent uplifts, we should uplift as often as possible, just because.

  Just a suggestion: could wizards themselves have made muggles? That would be why they're so much like wizards, and there are all manner of reasons why a wizard might have done so.
  ```

- u/MineDogger:
  ```
  I always thought of it like there was some kind of genetic divergence and muggle-ness was like the wizard equivalent of something like Downs-syndrome, and either it turned out to be a dominant genetic trait, or the muggles were forced to be better at cooperation, organization and industrialization because they lacked magic and eventually outnumbered wizards and forced them into hiding.

  Also "muggle" sounds a bit similar to "muddle" or "meddle" to me, so its possible that the condition was created either by breeding with non-humans or maybe some person or group was cursed to be without magic and the loss of powers was genetically transferred to their offspring.
  ```

- u/eaglejarl:
  ```
  Here's a thought:  muggles are to wizards what Cro-Magnon was to Neanderthals.  There could be a variety of reasons -- a few offhand:

  * Thaums alter probability in their areas, causing excess numbers of mutations and thereby interfering with wizard fertility and increasing the rate of wizard cancer
  * Thaumic neurology is less efficient than protoplasmic neurology, because [magiteknobabble]
  *  There are high- and low-magic areas of the world.  Wizards who spend much time in low-magic environments get the equivalent of vitamin deficiency diseases and eventually die.  This leaves ecological niches where muggles can thrive and wizards can't.
  ```

  - u/OffColorCommentary:
    ```
    There isn't an evolutionary path that would lead from human-like intelligence based on trapping exotic matter to human-like intelligence based on masses of neurons.

    Once both exist, all sorts of things like what you describe can happen, but I was stuck on the initial problem.
