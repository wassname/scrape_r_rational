## Route to world optimization, assuming infinite motivation

  I don't think simple motivation is the limiting factor here, compared to people having a limited amount of resources (including knowledge of how to do certain things) capable of leading to such change.

  For example, if we were to use the optimization criteria of "Maximize the odds of DataPacRat's long-term survival", and managed to avoid the weird potential edge-cases that don't actually include what that criteria is meant to mean, then giving me infinite motivation won't get me much further than I'm already doing. I'd probably exercise more and eat better, I might manage to acquire a few more bucks in a way that doesn't increase my long-term stress which I could use to buy some nootropics or other off-beat pepper-upper, maybe I'd run for the board of directors of my cryo organization and try to push them in one direction or another; but short of winning lottery-level resources, about the only other things that have a shot at improving that goal would be working towards other methods of winning something like a lottery, such as trying to become a best-settling authour or picking a set of zillionaires to lobby on the off-chance their resources could be redirected. And given the level of odds we're dealing with, it's at least plausible that making the attempts would increase the odds of my dying in the short term more than they'd increase my odds of long-term surviving.

  My specific goals, in world-optimisation terms, are pretty vanilla: get to a friendly AI singularity as quickly as possible, and minimise suffering in the meantime. For this, I go to 80,000 hours, check out their high-impact career recommendations, and then do all of them, simultaneously (okay, maybe not all of them, but as much as possible). I figure out how to spin my inhuman motivation levels into encouraging other people to do the same.

  Also, I get a legal name change to the Comet King, because at infinite motivation I'm totally allowed to do that.
