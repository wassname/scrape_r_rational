## Tight Shoes: Question about r!Animorphs Chapter 20

### Post:

I was wondering if the trick described in Chapter 20 of Animorphs: The Reckoning, where a character is feeling disoriented and overwhelmed, and another character ties his shoelaces super tight to relieve the excess mental energy, is a real thing; and if so where I can find some anecdotes and/or data about it?

[I tried searching for this and found nothing.]

Thank you!

  More generally, this kind of tactile feedback is commonly soothing to people with autism.

    I personally wear fingerless gloves with adjustable straps for exactly this reason.

  After I read that chapter, I went to the pet store and saw a jacket-like thing for nervous dogs, saying something about how pressure from the jacket helps them calm down.
