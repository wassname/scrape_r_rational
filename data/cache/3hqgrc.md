  Ugh, this is one of those stories where somebody "swearing by their magic" is an absolute proof of their sincerity about whatever it is they have sworn. 

  This would break canon so horribly, if it were part of the universe that I really don't know why any fanfic author ever had the bright idea of including it in their stories. Hey suspected Death Eater, swear by your magic that you're not a Death Eater.

  In this particular story, the author uses it to do away with the need of his character to collect any evidence whatsoever in order to prove the tidbits of knowledge he has as a self-insert.

    In all fairness, and as /u/Rhamni pointed out, canon is already completely broken by costless, effortless Unbreakable Vows.

    Edit: Also, without spoiling anything, I can now say that the author did more work to balance those oaths than you might expect.
    ```

  - u/Rhamni:
    ```
    Couldn't he just arrange for an Unbreakable vow? In canon they are do or die, with seemingly no cost to anyone else, so... Is anything preventing that?
    ```

      ```
      In canon, we see *one* instance of their use (and one near-use), and them being used sparingly (for some unstated reasons) is just as canon as them existing in the first place.

      Said reasons could be as simple as a bonder being able to sustain exactly one Unbreakable Vow at a time, and Bonder's death causing the Vow to expire some time after. Or, they could have the restriction that at least two of the three people involved be close blood relatives.

      I am not saying that this is canon, but there must be *something* to explain why nobody else on either side uses them. Think of it as a non-constructive proof.
      ```

    ```
    Ah, but there is a cost to our character abusing his vowing on his magic. Continue reading in and you will see there are consequences for these actions. As well as manipulating your own definitions of the wording to evade the intent of the vow.

  The pace seems a bit slow.  I feel like we're 90,000 words in and there hasn't been much conflict or tension yet.  The tension that has occurred has been almost immediately resolved, instead of being allowed to build up for even 5-10 minutes.  You can sort of see trouble on the horizon, but there isn't a sense of the stakes being real or tangible.

  edit: To add to that, it seems like a story where the protagonist can't lose.  I get the feeling he has plot armor much thicker then anything the author will throw at him.

    I suppose the majority of my enjoyment of the story comes from the talks with Professor Flitwick. The author's explanation of magic is quite interesting.
    ```

  It's alright but I wouldn't call it rational. Dialogue is very stilted and unnatural, and it takes itself a bit too seriously. As most people said there's barely any action and mostly exposition. Maybe you can call it rational when the MC actually makes rational plans and put them in action, but right now, nope.
  ```

- u/kaukamieli:
  ```
  i've read some chapters and I wouldn't say it's rational, really. Gilderoy just knows everything already and acts on that, instead of having to use any kind of rationality to find out stuff.
  ```

  - u/Lugnut1206:
    ```
    Exactly my thought about the 'rationality' of this story.

    Additionally, the plans he puts into action are shown to us on the fly, with no setup beforehand to allow the reader to come up with them on their own.
    ```

- u/Traiden04:
  ```
  I have came across a rather interesting self insert in which an american collage student is replacing the one and only Gilderoy Lockhart. The summary of the story is what caught my attention, "Most self-inserts are exercises in vanity, and nothing says 'vanity' quite like Gilderoy Lockhart. But with a new personality and knowledge of the future, who knows? Maybe Lockhart will turn out to be a useful DADA teacher after all."

  The story has been quite thoughtfully put together and has recently updated today. I think that most people here would enjoy it as well.
