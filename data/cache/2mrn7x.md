## Do you know any good movie or show that would fit the parameters of rational fiction?

### Post:

For example, I suppose V for Vendetta seems rationalist enough, even if not strictly so. Do you have any better fitting suggestions?
The real reason may or may not be that I'm out of good shows to watch.

  I am personally waiting for the animated series of Worm. (No, sadly this isn't actually a thing.)

  Elementary.

  Now, this isn't a rational detective show, those are from my prespective pretty much impossible to do with presenting, investigating and solving a murder in an one hour runtime, and much of the criticisms that might apply to the classic Sherlock Homes and its derivatives apply here too. Yes, even to the spectacular "Sherlock Holmes in the 22nd Century" which gaves us the Hound of the Baskervilles on the Moon.

  And although I do enjoy how the writers do try to use real concepts in plausible cenarios, even I will admit that they do take quite a bit of shortcuts and usual tricks which do not reflect reality in service of drama. And that's fine really.

  Because the truth, is that Elementary is a rational sociological show.

  Its interest comes from how the people work and live in belieavable ways, how they give themselves goals and work towards them, how they react in realistic ways and how they change and adapt their goals based on what happens. Contrary to the inferior example of BBC Sherlock in my opinion, here a grumpy or insulting Holmes is called out on his actions and words repeatedly, both when he's only trying to disguise his social bias with pseudo-science words and when his actions are in fact counter-productive to his objectives because he's human and his errors are human as well.

  It also has one of the best portrayals of addiction and its dificulties I've ever seen on a show.

  And now here's a series of spoilerrific examples from the first two seasons and the beginning of this new third one:

  [Joan](#s " doesn't let herself be insulted and points out the flaws and biases in Holme's justifications, instead of just bending to his authority. She calls him out on destructive behaviours both related to his drug use and otherwise and she becomes his friend in a rational way, i.e. avoiding the artificial creation of drama and applying conflict resolution when necessary instead of passive-agressive actions.")

  [Holmes](#s " wants to recover from hs addiction and listens, cosniders and updates his viewpoint as he is shown better ways to do things. He self-actualizes his knowledge, but he can't be an expert at everything, so he mantains contacts and relationships with various experts and is not above asking for help and denigrating himself to get his objective. He's not just a detective because he's bored or it's a way to blow out stress, but because its an action which he finds ethically correct and proper use of his resources. He enjoys sex for recreational, stress-relieving and a variety of purposes, but he doesn't put down people who seek relationships. He actually understands that social relationships are useful and rational for those who need it, and is not a 'rational Pinnochio'")

  [Moriarty](#s " is well... the Moriarty story arc is one of the best ones I've ever seen done, and specially in how it portrays the differences and consequences when one fails at those points I pointed out above.")

  It's really a wonderful show, which might not use the common 'rational' elements that fit all the checkboxes, but on the aspects that it wants to improve and stand out as such, it does so beautifully.

  Also, it has [this trailer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-aB2hU3axc).

  I haven't seen it in years, but I think Sunshine (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0448134/) at least attempts to be a rational story. There are lots and lots of movies where characters have some sort of a mission that will decide the fate of humanity, but this is the only one I know where the characters actually seem to understand what it means, the gravity of the situation, and try to act with a kind of pragmatic ruthlessness, as you would. 

  I can't guarantee that this is a 100% successful rationalist movie. I am sure that if I re-watched it, I'd notice lots of stupid stuff, too. But at least the movie had its brain in the right place and tried.

    I've seen it. Honestly, it seems that this "rationalist" side is a little overshadowed by the improbable dumb shit that happens.

  If you're up for anime, [Log Horizon](http://www.crunchyroll.com/log-horizon) is pretty rational (but not rationalist).

  Can't believe I miss this thread. 

  My roommates and I found the anime series "Legend of Galactic Heroes" fits the bill for a rational story.

  Highly recommend it.

  "The Man from Earth" I can't say that it is really fits the criterion, but I think I found it in this sub and love the shit out of it. It is about a man who claims to be immortal.

    In truth, I couldn't get around the fact that nobody tried to ask him to speak in ancient languages and maybe translate linear B.
