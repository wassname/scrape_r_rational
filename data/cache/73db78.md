  *Worth the Candle* is a webnovel about a teenage boy who gets dropped into a fantasy world that's a conglomeration of the ones he spent every night of his adolescence working on. He is, to all appearances, in a game of some kind, one that's brutally real and reticent to show its true nature. Forced to fight for his survival, he moves through a world that's both alien and familiar.

    you should probably think about submitting *Worth The Candle* to topwebfiction.com

    Your writing is definitely head and shoulders above a lot of the stuff there.

      Yeah, but I'm really frickin' lazy. I keep thinking that I should make a TV Tropes page too, but then I think that seems like work, and I don't do it, because I would rather put my efforts toward writing.

      Also, I'm not sure that they take submissions from things hosted on Ao3:

      > Note: we do not list stories on large sites like FictionPress or Authonomy, as they have their own very extensive communities, and we really can’t handle the volume.

      That's from their [submissions](http://webfictionguide.com/about/submissions/) page, and it's unclear whether Ao3 would count as a large site - I'd assume it would, but have no idea, and that means that it's more work and might just be pointless. (Also, Mother of Learning is on FictionPress, and still listed, so I don't think that's actually accurate to their policy.)
      ```

      - u/nytelios:

        I made a submission to topwebfiction's parent site (webfictionguide) [about a month ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6vy8h8/rt_worth_the_candle_chapter_2425/dm4u4i7/). I'm unsure whether ticking the I'm-the-author box would have expedited the process, but they do say it takes about a month for them to get to it. Details below - let me know if I should change anything. From the flavor of the week summary above, I venture you're still polishing the perfect pitch. I hope any changes don't set it to the back of the queue.

        **Tagline**: Is the game worth the candle?

        **Tags**: fantasy, magic, adventure, rpgs, sword and sorcery

        **Summary**: A self-insert litRPG portal fantasy. 

        A young man (the SI) suddenly finds himself falling off a plane into a new fantasy world. Being an old hand at D&D, some things seem disconcertingly familiar... but there's no time to ponder the similarities to the campaigns he used to run because there's a character sheet attached to his soul and this "game" is getting lethal real fast.

        This story uses some custom CSS for the character sheet and definition tags to allow mouseover on various game terms, so mobile and touchscreen users, you're missing out.
        ```

        - u/cthulhuraejepsen:
          ```
          Ah, thanks for that. I do recall that now, but it's one of those things that I guess I assumed had fallen off the radar or something. I appreciate it.

          I *am* working on the pitch a bit; my plan is to just write a new one whenever I post and figure out blurb-writing through iteration. It's difficult for this story in particular, I think, because it's somewhat deliberately generic in a few regards in order to give me room to play with the differences.
          ```

      - u/GaBeRockKing:
        ```
        From that submissions page, they say

        >The editorial board of the Guide has the final word on what to list and what not to list. If we think it belongs in our listings, we’ll list it.

        Which I gather to mean that they'll waive their restriction at their discretion.

        And yeah, it would definitely be work to put your story up somewhere new, but in terms of effort/reward I think the balance works out to be pretty good for your story. You've got an existing fanbase to quickly propel you up the rankings on your first week, and then it'll really pay dividends. Speaking personally, I at least check out any work new to the top ten or so, and I've read a bit from 17 of the top 20.

        But hey-- ultimately, it's your decision. If you need some motivation, however, think: can I really justify my SI practicing some inane task for hours on end, when I can't even self-motivate enough to submit my work to a webfiction catalogue? ;)
        ```

        - u/crivtox:
          ```
          That can be a benefit of writing Si , avoiding procrastination by precomitting to make your Si not able to do x thing  if you aren't  able to stop being lazy and do y thing.I actually tried that once but I haven't gotten to the point of being able to write enough for that to matter, so it didn't work.Anyway  he does have a fanbase  and he's most likely very invested in the story , so that could actually work .
          ```

        - u/nytelios:
          ```
          I already submitted it to webfictionguide, but if or when it gets nominated for the topwebfiction list is another story.

          I've known some authors who get drained by ancillary inane tasks, so I definitely prefer his prioritization of writing the story. Muses wait for no one. Plus these things can be done by fans.
          ```

          - u/GaBeRockKing:
            ```
            Sweet, so how do we get it nominated?
            ```

  - u/josephwdye:
    ```
    you are too good to us <3
    ```

  - u/SvalbardCaretaker:
    ```
    FYI, I much prefer smaller updates every two days over the batch-process of multiple chapters per 4 days. 

    Much more satisfactory and addictive, though its probably out of your hands in regard to beta readers etc.
    ```

    - u/cthulhuraejepsen:
      ```
      Noted. I think that's my preference too, but I kind of don't like the idea of releasing chapters where there's just some people talking and no conflict/resolution arc, or only a weak one, which makes me want to Voltron things up into a better-digested chunk. I've been around the block enough times to have seen people commenting on web serial chapters saying "meh, nothing happened" and I would rather that's not how people come away from any chapter of this, which I think they're less likely to if they can continue on to another chapter right away.

      But I also don't want to give in to the temptation to force every single chapter into the same setup/payoff or conflict/resolution format, because sometimes I just want space to breathe for a bit, and have something that's a tiny bit more slice-of-lifey (though I can't off-hand recall whether there are any individual chapters that actually do that).

      The compromise I make is with chapter chunking on occasion.

      (Alternately, sometimes there's a granular-level story beat that extends for 10K words, which is a little bit long for a chapter in my opinion (longer than a lunch break), and the chapter gets split in two partially in order to ensure that a more casual reader has good stopping points and doesn't have to push ahead, even if they're in the middle of something that should narratively be a single gigantic chapter.)

      I don't actually have anyone doing editing or beta reading (with this chapter set as an exception - I got some early feedback from some people on the discord, thanks /u/ketura) so that's not an issue. I write fast enough and at odd enough hours that I don't really want to wait around or talk things over or whatever, most of the time.
      ```

      - u/dalitt:
        ```
        Just my 2 cents: the chapter chunking works well.  Also, this story is probably the best currently-updating webserial on the internet, IMO.  Thanks for writing it!
        ```

      - u/ketura:
        ```
        Personally I love the chunking. It lets you have heavy chapters like the second one of this batch without ruining the reader's day at the same time.
        ```

      - u/nytelios:
        ```
        >  "meh, nothing happened"

        I loved how you smuggled that whole interlude in between two chapters.
        ```

- u/chicken_fried_steak:
  ```
  I love Juniper's reaction to the Fel Seed quest. Also, finally arriving at what I expect to be there big plot thread of the setting, if not Joons personal story: Fixing this crapsack world. A lot of quests are hinting at it... Fix all thirteen personified exclusion zones, become a God, rescue your best friend who may very well be in the 4000 hells, punish the wicked and reward the good kind of stuff.

  The one question I'm surprised his minmaxing instincts hasn't jumped on is... Can he draw unicorn time wankery out of the bones they collected? That would make fixing his boneitis much easier, assuming he can unlock soul manipulation at all.
  ```

  - u/Makin-:
    ```
    The way soul mages were described in this chapter makes me think Juniper *must* become a soul mage himself in order to fix his injuries, unless he stumbles upon a companion that can do it.

        It's a meme that spread out from /r/HFY. The subreddit's first [NSFW story](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/27ujw5/oc_pancakes_nsfw/) had "Pancakes?" as the closing line. It's become an in-joke in other stories when they want to imply interspecies hanky-panky.

  I'm guessing that we will finally find out what flower mages can do, and I particularly hope to learn the significance of juniper flowers/trees in Aerb. Earth has them as:

  > Juniper: Protection, Anti-theft, Love, Exorcism, Health. This is an excellent tree for healing and cleansing especially in curbing the spread of poisons or disease.

    Apparently they can at least predict the future, and thus generate further "is there free will"-type angst. :P

  >said Amaryllis. “Both are within exclusion zones.

  >“The Boundless Pit isn’t an exclusion zone,” said Amaryllis with a slight frown.

  Either I am missing something, or it should be clarified.
  ```

  - u/cthulhuraejepsen:
    ```
    I corrected this to:

    > One is within an exclusion zone, the other one might as well be.

    Sorry about that.
    ```

    - u/GaBeRockKing:
      ```
      Let's just pretend it's an exclusion zone. I just finished watching EP13 of made in abyss and any more references to "boundless pits" will probably give me feels-induced PTSD :P
      ```

  - u/nicholaslaux:
    ```
    My guess is that an exclusion zone is an explicit area where a particular type of magic or physics or something similar functions, specifically as cut off from the rest of the world.

    The Boundless Pit is probably just a place where there's a big hole, but not where magic or physics is fundamentally different than the rest of the world.
    ```

  - u/Makin-:
    ```
    Unless it's an error, I'm assuming the exclusion zone forms a ring around the pit, but the pit itself is not considered part of the zone. This makes sense because of teleportation, maybe?
    ```

- u/PM_ME_OS_DESIGN:
  ```
  So speaking of why Unicorns have their time abilities:

  What are the chances that Fenn will survive that train crash? Maybe Joon could revise it with his revision magic?

    Ha, nice one. 

    I live right next to a bar in Toronto called The Gaslight. These kind of jokes are played out with my friends.

  > “<...> show you a green line, that traces through every place you’ve ever been, and the touchstones in yellow,” said Amaryllis. 

  #

  >I almost asked what the yellow dots were, but I figured it out on my own <...>. Those, then, were the touchstones.

  Inconsistency.
  ```

  - u/cthulhuraejepsen:
    ```
    Fixed, thanks.
    ```

    - u/nytelios:
      ```
      Typo and one maybe typo:

      I~~f~~ don’t necessarily want to know

      Oh, how is your funny mind? (how is your mind funny?)
      ```

      - u/cthulhuraejepsen:
        ```
        Fixed, thanks!

        The other one I will declare Not a Typo. It's intended as "how is your mind doing, are you still not thinking jealous thoughts?" rather than "in what way is your mind funny", and to me that's the distinction between the two.
        ```

- u/LordOfCatnip:
  ```
  If Juniper's "alter ego" is Kupiner, than his companion would be ... Nary? B-marillys?

  As for exactly what tidbits he dropped, that's another tantalizing secret waiting to be revealed, along with:  
  -What does the Book of Blood say about elves and half-elves?  
  -Why does Fenn think being attracted to a half-elf would be a perversion?
  ```

- u/Gigapode:
  ```
  So the quest says Juniper knows the Fel Seed guy's weakness. Can anyone think of something we already know that might apply?

  I'm thinking it might be a DnD friend of Juniper's, whose favoured character has flaws Juniper would recognise. Alternatively, it might be an addiction to leveling up or maybe something related to simulated intelligence that isn't actually super-intelligence (though that one is pretty abstract).
  ```

- u/CaptainMcSmash:
  ```
  Were those quests mentioned just fluff pieces or do you really intend on story arcs that deal with every defeatable exclusive zone?
  ```

  - u/cthulhuraejepsen:
    ```
    Well, that would be spoilers.

    I will say that as a general rule I tend to dislike repeating myself, and I think 'go to place and kill person' probably would not make for terribly compelling reading by the tenth one - seems like you would eventually just have action and planning without any character change or plot revelation. (Not to say that it's impossible I would decide to do that, and some TV shows can manage on doing monster of the week, but if you're worried that it would drag on after a while, then yes, I would share that concern.)

    (Edit: If you're asking whether they all exist, that is, if they are all something other than a number, then yes, they are, because I love world-building wankery.)
    ```

    - u/i6i:
      ```
      I'm more concerned about quickly giving up on the other (43?) zones. It seems like pumping MEN should give you more options in regards to things that can't be punched until the get better or at least there should be someone out there figuring out what went wrong with the Rising Lands and how it could be reversed. "Help X research gather data for project Y" seems like a common enough RPG trope but I guess the group wouldn't realise that looking for things that Joon can do on his own. Anyway the proper way to get low difficulty side quests is obviously to go into a local bar and buy a drink to the most depressed looking person there.
      ```

  - u/Noumero:
    ```
    It's not necessary to have an entire story arc about each exclusion zone, even if Juniper will have to defeat every one. The party grows in power: some zones would be dealt with in one chapter, or even off-screen.
    ```

- u/adgnatum:
  ```
  I've been caught up for a few chapters now, and it's been great.

  After 41 I thought looking over the initial chapters, armed only with a bit of hindsight, might be interesting.

  e.g. from chapter 3
  > *Please, please don’t have Fel Seed.*

  (No such luck)

  or chapter 5
  > I couldn’t help but wonder if the pets had been turned by whatever apocalypse had hit Comfort, or if they had all starved to death in their cages and then risen as zombies after the fact.

  Has this been answered by the story yet? In favor of the former, I thought.
  ```

  - u/adgnatum:
    ```
    Also, recap-typo time

    ~~2: "without you know"~~


    ~~3: "succeeded in affection my"~~


    ~~5: “It’s at least beneficial form of insanity.”~~

    ~~6: "There was some differences"~~

    ~~"Amaryllis herself exactly who I had"~~

    ~~"I don’t think if she didn’t get the joke"~~
    ```

    - u/cthulhuraejepsen:
      ```
      Fixed all those, thanks!
