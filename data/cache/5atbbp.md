### Post:

## Last Time

[Last time,](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/58dfvg/biweekly_challenge_androids/?sort=confidence) the prompt was "Androids". The winner was /u/TennisMaster2 with their story, [Ana's Niceness](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/58dfvg/biweekly_challenge_androids/d90461s/). Go read it now! Congratulations to /u/TennisMaster2 on your second win!

##### This Time

This time, we're going to tackle ~~spiders~~ **Politics**, just in time for the U.S. presidential elections. I would strongly prefer a *smart*, *sane*, *thoughtful* look at the subject; in other words, do not take this as your opportunity to write about how your political tribe is better than the other political tribe, or about how some political position is superior to some other political position. Ideally I would like to see some stories about politics as compromise between people of different value systems, or politics as power dynamics, or failure modes of political systems. Or just write an episode of West Wing that deals with regulations in regards to outside context problems.

The winner will be decided **Wednesday, November 16th.** You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

##### Rules

* 300 word minimum, no maximum. Post as a link to Google Docs, pastebin, Dropbox, etc. **This is mandatory.**

* No plagiarism, but you're welcome to recycle and revamp your own ideas you've used in the past.

* Think before you downvote.

* Winner will be determined by "best" sorting.

* Winner gets reddit gold, special winner flair, and bragging rights. Five-time winners get even more special winner flair, and their choice of prompt if they want it.

* All top-level replies to this thread should be submissions. Non-submissions (including questions, comments, etc.) belong in the companion thread, and will be aggressively removed from here.

* Top-level replies must be a link to Google Docs, a PDF, your personal website, etc. It is suggested that you include a word count and a title when you're linking to somewhere else.

* In the interest of keeping the playing field level, please refrain from cross-posting to other places until after the winner has been decided.

* No idea what rational fiction is? [Read the wiki!](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index)

##### Meta

If you think you have a good prompt for a challenge, [add it to the list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B6HaZc8FYkr6l6Q4cwBc9_-Yq1g0f_HmdHK5L1tbEbA/edit?usp=sharing) (remember that [a good prompt is not a recipe](http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/prompts?src=RECIPE)). Also, if you want a quick index of past challenges, I've [posted them on the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/weeklychallenge).

##### Next Time

Next time we'll have a rather broad category; **Magic Systems**. Adapt a magic system from a work of fantasy, or create your own from scratch, then show at least some subset of the consequences or tricks. Visiting /r/magicbuilding might be helpful for this. I would ideally like prose submissions for this challenge (as usual), unless your worldbuilding or systembuilding writeup reads as good as prose. In other words, you don't have to *necessarily* have a story, but I expect the execution of pure exposition to be really well done (serving as an in-universe Slate Star Codex or Wait But Why article).

**Next challenge's thread will go up on 11/16.** Please private message me with any questions or comments. The companion thread will be posted later tonight.
