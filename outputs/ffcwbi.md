## Pyrebound 13: A Scholar in the Shadows

### Post:

The beginning of another arc.  I have to put text above the link here because automod tends to flag this as spam otherwise, so do pardon the inanity of that statement.

Probably most everybody here knows what PB is by now; it's the story of how terrible circumstances make terrible people in a magical pseudo-Mesopotamia.  [This](https://pyrebound.wordpress.com/2019/01/17/one-a-child-of-the-hearth/) is the first chapter.  I aim to post the last update--effectively the epilogue--around mid-July.  Thank you all for reading, voting, etc.!

  Finally seeing a flicker of light at the end of the tunnel for Rammash and his companions. Great story so far.
