  Ah man, Laura *had* to come knocking just as we were about to get some juicy powers exposition! 

  Tentative rating for Sepulcher: Shaker 7, Thinker 3, Mover 2. Depending on how big her range is and how many things she can do at once I think anything between Shaker 5 and 8 could be appropriate. Knowledge of any structure she's touching, including other people touching it, is a very useful but not particularly strong Thinker power, and the ability to boost herself and move through walls gives a low Mover rating.

  I don't know why you're getting downvoted. This is better than a lot of stuff on here.

  I enjoy this but Presto was stupid and it takes me out of the story with how stupid she is 

  Carmella last use of her powers when she felt threatened killed a half dozen people. 

  Presto decided it was a good idea to give her a jump scare 2 days later? 

  This isn't Presto having wacky fun, this is Presto asking to get smashed by spikes and have the parking garage ruined.  So far the protectorate has looked like competent professionals. Presto's actions in this chapter make them look like clowns.

    First off Presto is a woman. Secondly, it seems like she has some sort of reactive reality-warping going on. If she thought Carmin was a threat to her, she wouldn't have acted that way.

      Carmin is a threat.  

      The PRT/Protectorate has seen one use of Carmin's power... and it killed six people and injured a dozen more in the space of 5 minutes when she felt threatened.  

      Presto probably isn't in any danger... true, because she has powers.   The building and any civilians who are in a 200 foot radius... however. 

      Carmin's power is dangerous... her control is tenuous at this point... Presto doesn't know the limits of it (All the experimenting was done with Carmin's friend, not a Protectorate member.) 

      If something had gone wrong, if Carmin had folded up the car, or put a pit trap in the parking garage, or booby trapped the shifter... Is Presto just going to apologize?   "Yeah, I'm sorry, director. I know you need to spend 200,000$ to fix the building and rebuild 4 vehicles, but I thought it was really important that I startle a prospective member with an untested power in a public area as opposed to waiting a day to use our purpose built facilities.  Also, she's probably suffering a lot of trauma from the attack that triggered her powers in addition to feeling responsible for the deaths of several people.  So again.  Startling her in a parking garage was the best call."    

      It was stupid and took me out of the story because our "fun mentor" character is clearly an incompetent idiot and the author of this webfiction, which is good so far, didn't realize it. That was the difference in Worm between the Undersiders and the Wards/Protectorate when we had our interludes.  The Undersiders were irresponsible and did some stuff for kicks, while the Wards and the Protectorate were always shown as being bound by regulations with more strictures. Sometimes hypocritically, but they  made  sense.  Startling someone who is potentially dangerous in the car as an introduction is something I'd expect from Regent in the original story, but not from any of the Protectorate capes who have been shown to have protocols about things like this.

        Just to be clear Carmilla's power manifesting only resulted in one death, though there were also quite a few injuries.

        &#x200B;

        You raise good points, which we should hope will be addressed in future chapters. I wouldn't know anything about that, of course.

  I've been enjoying this so far. I do wonder, how come that the option of joining a non-profit organization didn't come up? Even if their health care normally isn't that good, you should be able to negotiate a really good pay/benefits with that power set.
  ```

  - u/SilverstringstheBard:
    ```
    The core reason is that Carmilla just really wants to be a superhero, but there are practical considerations as well. She doesn't have full control over her power and figures that surrounding herself with people experienced in using their powers might be the best way to fix that. Doing construction without gaining control of her power could be a disaster.
