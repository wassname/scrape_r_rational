      You say that now, but in two years neither Reimer nor we will know how he became the father of Lisi's children.    
      Also, is it really *long-distance* relationship when they're a teleport (something almost as good) away from each other?

        And which entad will they be given for visitations? Egress seems not great with dragon approved flight plans, teleportation key is too valuable, I don't think we have any other teleport ones on record yet.

        - u/signspace13:

          I think the Egress kind of dodges the dragon thing, cause it's reflective surface makes it basically invisible in flight, though I could be wrong.

  ```
  Man that first section took me a while to realize which Reimer we were dealing with and whether he was speaking about the context of a campaign or not. I also feel like the 3rd person viewpoint feeds into my perception that Reimer's pretty shallow and I'm not sure that's warranted.

  ...

  Having finished the chapter now, I'm struck by how minimally people in Aerb react to what I would think would be massively traumatic events. Reimer admits he doesn't have the skills or mindset to do this kind of thing regularly, but seems to think the breakpoint is whether or not one enjoys doing it, not whether one can go through it without mind-breaking stress making them non-functional for hours-years afterward.
  ```

  - u/MythSteak:
    ```
    >Having finished the chapter now, I'm struck by how minimally people in Aerb react to what I would think would be massively traumatic events.

    I mean, Reimer spends quite a bit of time reminiscing in the lessons from a *disaster preparedness class*, and he is from some rural backwater of a village.  Such classes and clubs have to pretty common to the functioning nations of Aerb.  The practical people probably did practical things before the ignorant even recognized the danger. 

    This chapter is from Reimer's  perspective.  He is a supremely practice person, he noticeds the potential danger way before the regular people around him did, he reacted quickly by going to Lisi, then both of them did their best to escape the city...

    ... and he probably never had a chance to see regular people freaking out.  Regular people probably started to freak out when the claws started to come down, but Reimer acted so fast that he was either in the car or fighting for his life during almost the whole period Mom Rathe was actually visable- if he was focused on efficiently avoiding the danger, would he waste time watching other people freak out?

  This story is [now available on Royal Road](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25137/worth-the-candle), where it will be posted two chapters a day until it reaches the in-progress point, about three months or so from now. If you have an account there, and you're a fan of the story, I would appreciate a rate/review/favorite/follow, which I think are the relevant metrics.

  Also, official art for a few of the characters will be coming soon, probably with the next update, which hopefully won't be as long as some of these waits have been.

    Awesome! Any plans to self-publish it? Even with a glowing recommendation people are completely unwilling to read on their computers or phones for 80+ hours(985k words divided by average reading speed of 200wpm) when **they would be willing** and even glad to pay 5 bucks to put the first volume of that highly recommended story directly on their kindle. 

    I had this problem when recommending worm, twig and MoL. I feel like even now they don't get anywhere close to the amount of attention they deserve, despite being recommended often on r/fantasy and on other subs.

      Unless I manage to snag traditional publishing somehow, which is unlikely given that I'm not putting any effort into it, it's going to be self-published when it's complete with some minimal editing (as I wouldn't expect to be able to recoup the costs of an actual editor, nor the time it would take to do my own edit).
      ```

      - u/GlueBoy:
        ```
        I'm glad to hear it. 

        I would think twice about traditional publishing, though. From reading a lot of author's blogs and podcasts I think the general opinion on traditional publishing nowadays is that it's a pretty bad deal for all but the top 1% of authors, and in the process of getting worse. They give you a pittance of a percentage(+10% is only for the most special of darlings), they barely promote you(or not at all, in many cases) while expecting and demanding that you do it yourself via social media, and on top of all that they've begun to force their authors to relinquish all the more lucrative rights(like audiobook and overseas), which require no work on their part, whether to negotiate or to implement. 

        Here's a professional author's [advice to new authors](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/amdgz6/my_best_advice_to_authors_has_completely_changed/), with facts and figures provided, and [another one](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/6f1v96/why_del_rey_and_i_will_be_parting_ways/) where he explains in detail why left Del Rey over audiobook rights. He has several other posts like that one, and a lot of comments elaborating.

        Honestly, as-is the story is better edited than novels I've paid actual money for on Kindle. IMO you'd be totally justified in chopping the thing into book-sized chunks and publishing e-books.

        And hey maybe you'll get enough sales to hire a professional editor, and then the problem will solve itself.

        - u/lifelingering:

          Completely agree, this story without any changes at all would easily be in the top 10% of both writing and editing quality of self-published stuff I have read.

      Just realized that I never answered this, sorry.

      The upshot is that RR asks/demands *way* more than they need to just host the content, and this is scummy, and I don't like it ... but it's a lot of exposure, which potentially means more money, and they don't seem to actively be screwing anyone at the moment, so it's balancing uncertain future liability against almost guaranteed current income. Plus more people will probably read the story this way, which I generally consider a plus, if I think they'll like it.

      I think the thing that tipped it for me was that AO3 doesn't allow [Patreon links](https://patreon.com/alexanderwales), but RoyalRoad has those (and PayPal donate buttons) baked in. I'd be perfectly happy putting this story out without any income whatsoever ... but in another year or two I'm going to have to decide whether I can justify writing fulltime or whether I need to go back to having "real" job, and I think I would regret it if I didn't try as much as I could to make the money side of things work.

  I wonder how being a blood mage affects that. The hormonal side-effects would still happen, and the uterine lining itself still needs to be shed, but I'd guess conscious control over blood would make the flow a lot lighter and probably help with cramps.
  ```

  - u/Kilbourne:
    ```
    Couldn't your shred the lining using micro-pressures in your blood and carry it as regular blood-borne debris to the liver and kidneys?

    On the other hand, that would probably require incredibly fine levels of control, beyond that of Lisi's level.

  And he knocks it out of the park, once again. Kudos, Mr. Wales, I have absolutely no idea how you've managed to make something as consistently high quality as this story for as long as you have, but I hope it continues on, at least for the foreseeable future.

  Reimer is a really interesting character. He might be one of the first we've seen to have an explicitly overall-negative view of Juniper (correct me if I'm wrong of course, it's been a while since I've done a re read). For that alone I think he's far more interesting than maybe he's given credit for.

  To be honest, my assumption for this arc was that Reimer would find himself lumped with a too-useful-not-to-bring-him-with-us ability, and kind of get forcibly taken along by Joon and Co., perhaps with his condition for consent being that Lisi gets dragged along as well.

  This is more true to his character, though, so is probably more satisfying in the long term. On the edge of my seat for whatever follows.
  ```

    > He might be one of the first we've seen to have an explicitly overall-negative view of Juniper

    Well... There are a number of currently dead people who held this opinion.

    Finch doesn't seem to like him much either, and could just be working with him because of how stupidly powerful he is.
    ```

  - u/GlueBoy:
    ```
    I wouldn't say he has an "overall-negative view of Juniper", we're just getting the unvarnished truth by peeking into his mind. 

    I think that's how you think of long time friends, people who you know very intimately, warts and all, and whom you take for granted are still going to be around in 10 or 20 years. Whereas with a new friend you might make allowances if they become belligerent and get into a fight or whatever, with this kind of friend you know them so well --or think you do-- that you dissect their actions dispassionately in your mind(e.g. "Paul's always a petty little bitch when he's high on top of being drunk").

  I love having the occasional short chapter where we see the protagonist’s growth from someone else’s viewpoint. You can’t do it more than once or twice, because then it becomes gratuitous “look at how amazing the protagonist is; aren’t they the best?”, but there’s just something so satisfying about blowing someone’s expectations out of the water.

  I’m probably not explaining this well.

  But in any case I enjoyed this chapter a great deal, and I also thought it important to see the fear and devastation inflicted by Mome Rath from the point of view of someone who is basically a normal civilian. Juniper and Co. are so strong by now that it can be hard to remember, as a reader, just how terrifying it would be to have an antimemetic kaiju descend out of the clouds onto your town.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Oh, I totally get you. From the party's perspective in this kind of story, they're still struggling to barely survive against the threats arrayed against them, and they know the progression that got them to where they are. But then when you switch perspectives to a normal NPC, the party seems like these impossible, invincible gods. It's great.

        That... isn’t that far from the truth either.  

        An eldritch abomination forced Juniper to possess a Aerb body and *then* turned possessed-Juniper into another eldritch abomination

        EDIT:  Earth-Juniper could even be legitimately seen as some sort of deity or world-progenitor.  As he notes in this chapter, Earth-Juniper invented *how much* of Aerb's magic, terrain, and people?

    You would hate xianxia, then. It seems like the only reason xianxia writers bother with alternate points of view is to have the side character mentally-ahegao at every contrived thing the MC does.

    - u/rabotat:
      ```
      > You would hate xianxia,

      I certainly do.

      I understand people have different tastes, but how someone can enjoy that badly translated mess is beyond me.

      The only *readable* thing I encountered in that genre is Savage Divinity.

      It has all the stupid tropes (harems, ugh), but at least it's written relatively well.
      ```

      - u/signspace13:
        ```
        As someone who has enjoyed Xianxia in the past, even *MTLed* Xianxia, it is certainly an acquired taste, and one I haven't had an appetite for in awhile, the only Xianxia that I read nowadays is Forge of Destiny or more accurately the sequel. I tried Savage Divinity and liked the world and magic system, but a ways in I just couldn't stand the MC, he is just so self pitying, his constant stream of self derogatory thoughts is just annoying, especially when they are usually completely inaccurate and entirely his self deception.

        - u/elysian_field_day:

          \+1 on FoD/ToD. I don't generally like xianxia because of the aforementioned tropes, but this is a really good story with interesting world-building and great characters.
          ```

          - u/signspace13:
            ```
            Yeah, they are really a fantastic example of the series, the author just seems to understand the genre *really* well and is building on the tropes with great characters and worldbuilding, instead of just ignoring them and trying to remake the wheel. The genre has a lot going for it and is especially suited for the serialized webnovel format (as it was basically created in concert with the format), the continuous escalation and action magic that can always be new and interesting.

            Metaworld Chronicles is another fun web serial.  The author is super Australian, so if you can get used to the Australian slang and the other peculiarities of a un-edited web serial, it is a lot of fun.

              Of the Top Web Fiction I follow The Guide, The Wandering Inn, Worth the Candle and Mother of learning. 

              I've read Worm and half of Twig, The Gods are Bastards, Good Student, How to avoid Death and a bit of Iron teeth.

              Wildbow is too tense and grim for my tastes, Iron Teeth is badly written, mooderino starts well but gets bored with his own stories and veers into weird surrealistic stuff.

              The Gods Are Bastards started as a copy of MU, only better, but with time it introduced too many POVs and characters, so it lost my interest. Otherwise it's written alright.

                I agree on almost everything you just said, though I think you should give TGAB another shot, the author is very good at what he does, and that is mainly character writing, the number of characters he has may seem extraneous (bad it certain feels that way early on), but his writing get noticeably better as the series continues.

                Edit: and while I agree that wilbow is super grim, his writing quality and capability tend to over shadow that.
                ```

                  I mean, certainly. I've read the entire Worm, that's a lot of reading. I wouldn't have done that if he wasn't a good writer. And I've read more than half of Twig and less than half of Pact.

                  The thing is you can be the greatest writer in the world, there will always be people who don't enjoy your style.

  I wonder how many of us are just waiting for the woodworking arc, wherein the following things should be fashionable: resurrection chamber, robot army, death star, voidbeast eater, stars etc. A godawful number of problems can be solved with "anything", all that matters is wood supply and time.

  Honestly from chapter one I've been rooting for this little skill, and was utterly horrified when June didn't try to carve some figurines for the tabletop game with his new friends.
  ```

  - u/ricree:

    ```

    - u/IronPheasant:
      ```
      Exclusion mostly seems like a way to preserve a nightmarish threat that would otherwise wipe out all life on the planet, or a way to retire a campaign's threat to give something new a chance to take its place.

      I'd expect maximum narrative escalation. Or at least for the wood to be haunted by vengeful tree spirits that taint his wishes.

    - u/Watchful1:
      ```
      Does anyone know if there were things excluded during Uther's time? I know there were things excluded before and after him, but did his actions actually cause any exclusions?

      ```

      - u/MythSteak:
        ```
        Uther has had a couple magic systems go extint.

        Uther directly killed/successfully repressed spirit magic into non existence (I dont have a chapter quote, but I am pretty sure this is correct)

        Ice magic somehow got excluded near Uthers era (this is my imperfect memory, because I dont have the quote)
        ```

        - u/Watchful1:
          ```
          Yeah, but I'm specifically talking about the exclusion principle. Especially with Juniper worried about being all Prince’s Invulnerability right now.

          I'm betting it will come to a head sooner than later. Prince's itself being excluded would be fairly low impact and if it doesn't happen, Juniper's all but immortal for the rest of the series.
          ```

          - u/MythSteak:
            ```
            Right, I think that he might have gotten Ice Magic excluded somehow?  Or maybe Im miss remembering it

              ```
              Ah, you're right

              > My germ of a theory was that Uther had been the cause of most of the exclusions. Because the historical record of exclusions lined up with the numbering of exclusions as written on my soul, it was easy enough to make some guesses in that direction. Ice Magic was “Deprecated, Exclusion #16”, and that meant that it must have chronologically happened after the so-called ‘Invasion of the Ice Wizards’, which had concluded by 4 FE. I wasn’t entirely sure that Uther had been responsible for that, but his historians had written about him climbing the Glacial Minaret to face down the ruling council of wizards, and after he’d defeated them, Ice Magic had become a lost art. Maybe he wasn’t responsible, but he was certainly implicated.

              There goes that theory.

              Or maybe he created the exclusion himself somehow?
              ```

              - u/IronPheasant:
                ```
                I view it as a world built for only one person. Ice magic had to be retired because how lame would it be to repeat the same campaign you just finished, decisively? The DM is a hack fraud, but he's not that bad at his job.

                I view it more as a *A Mind Forever Voyaging* type deal, where the entire point is what would the player do when given power over other people. An NPC isn't allowed to break or even significantly change the game world, but PC's are perfectly free to do so.

                Another bout of 100 Still Magic + Prince's, gets you a terrifying world full of people with nets and spider webs everywhere.

        No idea. The "no new exclusions" idea is interesting and plausible, but I don't think we have enough evidence to say one way or the other.

  - u/Versac:
    ```
    I doubt Woodworking 100 will let Joon carve a square circle. If it made it into the system as per original specs then it's a brokenly powerful perk to be sure, but there's plenty of room for it to be limited even without overt DM action.

    (Eg: Wooden Death Star? Cool, go get a zettagram of raw materials and we'll get right on it!)

      Thankfully there's a Death Star already hanging out in the sky, all they need is a way to hijack it without dying.

  I'm growing to like Lisi quite a bit the more I see of her. She and Amaryllis seem to be cut from the same cloth and competent, ruthless-when-necessary people (usually women but men too, when written well) get my motor running in a non-sexual way.


  Current prediction: Lisi will end up with Joon as a political marriage to bring him into the Lost King's Court. It will turn out that Amaryllis was the the matchmaker behind the scenes since it allows her to do the politically expedient thing without having to deal with the ick that's supposed to come with marriage (I love ace representation since it took web fiction for me to realize there was a word for how I felt about sex). Reimer will be understandably PISSED.

    ```
    There was originally a longer thing in there, but it was cut for pacing. The brain does a lot of funny stuff to maintain illusions of perception. Notably, there's a blind spot right in the center of your field of vision, where your optic nerve is, because it ends right in the field of the retina, blocking out ability to see there. Your brain either uses the fact that you have two eyes to figure out what's missing there, or it makes a guess based on the surroundings, if that's not possible. Unlike with the bridge of your nose, you can't choose to notice that this blind spot exists and is being filled in by your brain.

    I've been thinking about this a fair amount since getting glasses, because my brain has been getting better and better at filtering them out.

  It's really interesting to see the sheer distance Joon and Co have come from another perspective. Like Lisi is this hyper competent, cool-under-pressure Rambo type. Nothing phases her and she never panics when reacting to even crazy shit happening to her, she just gets to work, tries to save people and problem solve. 

  But then there's Mary. Where Lisi preps a go bag, Mary preps an entire nation in her pocket she can mobilize in an instant. It's an entirely different scale.

  Didn't Earth!Joon run The Long Stairs campaign too? So when Earth!Joon says "...the Aerb Juniper’s stuff doesn’t show up on Aerb," is he lying or is he using Reimer's DnD records to determine that certain content like the Long Stairs does not exist in Aerb?

  I just caught a very sneaky bit of foreshadowing in chapter 108:

  > This continued on for longer than it seemed like it should have. I understood that it was probably calibration, but I didn’t really need thirty names and places from Aerb in a row. At first they were blue or green across the board, but the last ten had a few yellow and gray, presumably because they were more obscure. Whatever Mome Rath was, I had apparently forgotten it.

  This is very clever, and makes me want to read the story again to catch other bits of reference to later reveals / worldbuilding.

  Also, this suggests that:

  - The last ~10 items on Uther's dream-skewered list are antimemetics.

  - Uther had some way to remember antimemetics, because of course he did.

  Great story

  10 cultures per species seems low. How many cultures would you say humanity has?

  Is your period an issue for a blood mage? Seems like that would be one of the first things you could solve? She also seems like the type of person to have this worlds equivalent of an implant.

  Also not sure that she seems like the person to be bothered by her period anyway. Hard to imagine the cultural norms around not having sex on periods still exist.
  ```

  - u/cthulhuraejepsen:
    ```
    Ten cultures per species is an intentional lowball on my part, predicated on what "culture" would mean to someone on Aerb, especially someone from the agrarian ass-end of Anglecynn where most of their knowledge comes from radio plays or imported books. So to Juniper, "a culture" probably means distinctly different language, substantially different food, customs with little overlap, etc. A similar rubric applied to Earth would probably see (for example) all the Nordic countries mushes together, all the Pacific Islanders mushed together, etc. On Aerb, that would still leave you with (as a ballpark) 2,000 cultures.

    Of course, talking about how many cultures there are is kind of a folly, since two different towns can have their own culture, even if they belong to the same ur-culture, so it all kind of comes down to how you define things.

      Yeah I wondered about that, especially re:Dwarves where it seemed like they have lots of languages which is most peoples benchmark for culture IRL I'd say.
      ```

      - u/cthulhuraejepsen:
        ```
        Dwarves are a good case study, since every dwarfhold has its own culture, but they share a lot in common, especially in comparison to the cultures of other species:

        * They live underground
        * One of the primary professions is farmer/miner
        * They consume *kear* and its related products
        * They're (mostly) unigendered
        * They're parthenogenetic
        * They generally speak something in the Groglir family of languages
        * They generally share either ancient ancestral backgrounds, or cross-pollination from other dwarfholds, or both

        All that contributes toward certain cultural trends that will be near-universally present in dwarves, and from a distance, it might look like there's just a monolithic "dwarf culture", even if there isn't. If you're looking slightly closer, you might divide up "dwarf culture" into broad categories, like "shadow city dwarf culture" or "agkrioglian dwarf culture" or "metropolitan dwarf culture", or divide them by the type of stone they live in (which informs a lot of their housing, city structure, and what the particular nature of their *kear* is), or divide them by the common ways for structuring their societies, or even by their different ethnicities.

        But for the Aerb version of Juniper, it's maybe ten, unless you want to get granular, and no one at the table objects to that characterization.

  - u/Mason-B:
    ```
    >  Hard to imagine the cultural norms around not having sex on periods still exist.

    The cultural norms around shaming people on their period are stupid. But there are a lot of reasons to not have sex during one's period, none of which are really "eww periods" cultural norms, that practical. From cramps, to being too sensitive during it, to hygiene, to not liking blood (or for example getting it on bed sheets). Especially not for a first time having sex (though Lisi seems unlikely to care) since people like making good first impressions.
    ```
