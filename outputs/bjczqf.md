- u/JanusTheDoorman:
  ```
  It's remarkable to me that even stripped of his Name, tied up, and waiting to be soul-severed, Amadeus still feels like he's in the top 10 most dangerous people on Calernia.
  ```

  - u/grewthermex:
    ```
    And he's not wrong either, who else could say the exact words to absolutely shake the foundations of belief in arguably the greatest hero in calernia? Scion from Worm barely had that power.
    ```

    - u/fortycakes:
      ```
      He's more Jack Slash than Scion, here.
      ```

      - u/Zayits:
        ```
        Jack Slash is the one who branded him into eventually losing his name in the first place. Not sure if we have a stand-in from Worm who would have the same combination of military MO, opinions  abouth the so-called"balance" being unfair and rigged, and ability to express it to his opponents.
        ```

- u/Zayits:
  ```
  > “Indeed,” he casually agreed, unwilling to pursue the debate that if any of the things the Pilgrim had named were inherent instead of ascribed, they became utterly meaningless.

  I wonder whether this dialogue is a story setup and Amadeus just framed himself as the amoral nihilistic monster.
  ```

  - u/Frommerman:
    ```
    He's always referred to himself as a monster of the very worst kind.
    ```

    - u/PotentiallySarcastic:
      ```
      Yeah, the type that isn't an amoral nihilistic monster.
      ```

  - u/PotentiallySarcastic:
    ```
    Amadeus is offering a different framework of ethics than Pilgrim's.

    He didn't really say where he falls himself. Maybe it could be twisted to make a story but Black could just as easily shatter it.
    ```

  - u/Locoleos:
    ```
    All amoral nihilistic monsters are moral antirealists, but not all moral antirealists are amoral nihilistic monsters.
    ```

- u/JesradSeraph:
  ```
  Pilgrim is cast as the villain, who names the hero as a peer before said hero swears to strike him down to avenge a loved one.

  You brought this on yourself, Tariq.
  ```

- u/Menolith:
  ```
  I love how ill-fitting Black is to the world he's in. He takes to it like fish to water, but it's just a delight to see him sneer at what the Pilgrim has devoted his life to. The monologue Black gave to Cat way back when he was talking about his motivations is still probably my favorite moment in the entire series.
  ```

- u/TrebarTilonai:
  ```
  It wasn't me, but someone in the comments on the page raised an interesting point for discussion. This Face-thief impersonated the Princess of Cantal for half a year. Hmm... who do we know from Cantal that is a most excellent actor?
  ```

  - u/TheVenomRex:
    ```
    Unlikely, the prince of Cantel currently serves as an excellent subversion on psychopathy.   
    Remarked on two times as setup, and then shown to be a principled person anyway
    ```

    - u/Razorhead:
      ```
      Doesn't mean he isn't a psychopath though. Psychopaths can care about things, though those things are usually self-centered and egocentric. In fact common treatment of psychopathy to curb criminal and anti-social behaviour is by focussing on the egocentric parts and how following social custom and pro-social behaviour is beneficial for the person in question.

      It's entirely possible Arnaud is a psychopath, just one who thinks Procer's benefit is to his own and is therefore willing to do anything to achieve this.
      ```

- u/chaos-engine:
  ```
  Wonder why this chapter wasn't titled as an Interlude...

  Is Black becoming a main character?
  ```

  - u/calmingRespirator:
    ```
    It’s a bonus chapter, those are generally not titled as interludes. Black isn’t becoming a main character.
    ```

    - u/ATRDCI:
      ```
      Arguable, since Rogue Sorcerer is becoming more relevant as a member of their five man band and it seems all but confirmed that they are hiding Black's soul by having the Rogue Sorcerer half possessed by him
      ```

    - u/chaos-engine:
      ```
      Ah, thanks
      ```

- u/FormerlySarsaparilla:
  ```
  Man I love the characterization of Amadeus.
  ```

- u/NZPIEFACE:
  ```
  Why do we have two separate links to chapters posted at the same time?
  ```

  - u/Mountebank:
    ```
    Because they're different chapters. First of the month has a bonus chapter.
    ```

- u/Zayits:
