## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  I've recently realized that I've made some unconscious assumptions about how certain fictional problems could best be handled, and I want to find out what other options might be available. One example: publicly precommitting to use a neutral third-party mediator in case of a dispute has certain advantages, but I don't know enough about the topic to know if this might lead to any unfortunate incentives that wouldn't appear with some other dispute-resolution scheme, or that might be handled by being careful about certain details. Also have some questions on several related topics.

  Any pointers?
