## [D] Sunday Writing Skills Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Sunday thread for discussions on writing skills!

Every genre has its own specific tricks and needs, and rational and rationalist stories are no exception. Do you want to discuss with your community of fellow /r/rational fans...

* Advice on how to more effectively apply any of the [tropes](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RationalFic)?

* How to turn a rational story into a rationalist one?

* Get feedback about a story's characters, themes, plot progression, prosody, and other English literature topics?

* Considering issues outside the story's plain text, such as titles, cover design, included imagery, or typography?

* Or generally gab about the problems of being a writer, such as maintaining focus, attracting and managing beta-readers, marketing, making it free or paid, and long-term community-building?

Then comment below!

Setting design should probably go in the Wednesday Worldbuilding thread.

  Does anyone have recommendations for describing how a character with strange abilities gets more effective at those abilities? If you have any examples of training strange powers you can link to, I'd love to hear it.

    Book 1 of Mistborn (The Final Empire) comes to mind, as the main character has a variety of magical powers that she's trained in the use of.  One of the things I recall Sanderson specifically doing with the magic was creating some of the powers in such a way that they actually caused the user to perceive the world differently (even for powers that were not specifically centered around perception).

    Specifically, one class of magic users (Lurchers) is able to pull metal objects in their environment toward them.  To observers, all they can see is the metal object flying toward the Lurcher; it might look like the ubiquitous Jedi force pull.  However, when the Lurcher uses their power, they are able to sense metal objects nearby, and when concentrating, they can "see" lines connecting them to the metal objects that they're capable of pulling, almost like invisible threads that are connecting them to proximate metal objects, and they can then select one of those threads and "pull" on it to draw the object to themselves.  (Note that the "pulling" doesn't actually involve actually physically tugging on a string with their arms; in practical terms it's sort of like a telekinetic psychic power.)

    Once the reader understands this visual language for communicating the mechanics of the Lurcher's metal pulling ability, it becomes more apparent how one might "master" this ability.  Namely, a big part of a Lurcher's skill comes from her ability to cut through the noise: when the Lurcher is in an area with lots of metal objects, there are lots of little lines, and pulling a specific object to yourself requires the ability to identify which of the little invisible "strings" is the one that corresponds to the object that you're trying to pull.  Pull too hard on the wrong "string," and you might find that there's suddenly a nail hurdling in your direction at high velocity, ready to impale you.

    I'm not sure if this example is sufficiently "strange" to address your question, but to speak more generally, finding ways like this to make powers more manifest also creates plausible scenarios in which one could be "bad" at the magic, which creates room for improvement, and opportunities for learning.

  JaNoWriMo is well underway: https://www.beeminder.com/mad/janowrimo

  I've plotted out the whole of the first "volume" now, so I know what happens (my story has 3 volumes, each about 30,000 words I think).

  I kind of hate the quality of my writing, but I suppose there's little that can be done for that until I am able to get heavy editing done. 

  I wrote 1300 words in 2 hours yesterday, which is kind of sobering / scary. I'm back at work today so I'm not sure I'm going to have as much time to write as I'd like. I also discovered I have a hard time writing at home so I've been using public libraries.

  [This is what I wrote in about 2 hours yesterday](https://draftin.com/documents/981640?token=2lvBRDwfJXf_6mSXaPg1P8ZH74378laVaSMhKhUkm5EUNMXQKESghEw3IpcqAv-zp0P5L2Rlqhhas-7832l8ezw). It was meant to be about one thing but then the characters drew the conversation elsewhere, which was less than ideal, but c'est la vie.

  My husband also finally read what I've done so far! Predictably he didn't like it (it's vampire yaoi after all), but at least someone else went to the trouble of reading it :)

  Hopefully one day I can fix it up so it's a bit more shareable, but at the moment I feel too vulnerable opening it up to be torn apart. I think it's because I don't  feel like any of the passages are "finished" yet, so they're not a true reflection of my abilities.

    I think you are being unkind to yourself.

    What little I see here shows dedication and skill. More to the point, it is something that—had I happened upon it in some bookstore or obscure website—I would not hesitate to give a full read.

    Kudos to you for even being willing to share online. That takes a measure of bravery that I've yet match in any other context than a few writing prompts.

    I look forward to seeing your work in the future! Consider me a fan!

      Oh my god thankyou so much! You have no idea what that means to hear :). 

      I'll definitely post more on the weekly writing skills threads, and I'm considering sharing the final work in a serial form on here if people would find it rational. I'm doing my utmost to have the setting rational, and the characters act rationally, but the genre seems wrong. (But that's probably just because the rationalverse is typically considered to be "cishet white males with CS degrees", and vampire yaoi is not really targeted at that audience; maybe publishing some might help reveal the hidden diversity or at the very least help to buck that impression?)
