  The story being referred to around 33 minutes in is, I believe, The Gentle Seduction. I highly recommend it.

  Here's the newest episode! Man vs Man is the shortest section because it's the most familiar to most people, and because our next episodes are going to be focusing on antagonists. Next week we're going to take a break, and might shift to a 3-episodes-per-month format instead of a weekly one. 

  Feel free to leave a review on iTunes if you can, and thanks for listening!

    I'm listening to it now and quite enjoying it.  I'm curious -- are you guys co-located, or are you doing this remotely somehow?

      Remotely over Skype. I use MP3 Skype Recorder as freeware to record our calls, which works pretty well for the most part (it did fail to record an episode once though, which was pretty annoying, so there's still some technical difficulties).

      I use Audacity to edit the sound file and clean it up, then convert back to an MP3 for uploading. I haven't tested the recording software's conversion to Audacity with a 3-way call yet, but once I do, we've talked about bringing in guest speakers like yourself at some point, if you're interested and have a topic you'd like to speak on.

        I would like that, yes.  You guys have been doing a great job with high-level techniques (Types of Conflict, Tropes, etc), so maybe I could be part of an object-level talk?  That is, concrete techniques for getting past writer's block, planning your characters and plot, etc.
        ```

          Sounds good :) Right now we've got at least another few weeks of "basic stuff" to get through, with the occasional specific topic to change the pace, but I'll let you know when we're ready to branch out!
