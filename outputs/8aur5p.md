  If we didn't already know that this was Book 3 of 3, I'd expect for this to have been the end of Book 3 and start of Book 4, with something very critical changing fundamentally as the next phase begins.  As-is I expect this will throw a monkey wrench into the works but ZZ will still figure out a solution.

  Glad to see the return of real stakes, though.  It's been mentioned in previous chapters that the many things ZZ need to do can get stale when the worst possible outcome for anything is losing one restart, and not only is QI one of the few opponents that outclasses ZZ his soul magic makes the stakes properly intense again.

  ZZ are a lot closer to getting out now that they can get the Ring and possibly the Dagger, but the Rod is still unknown and they still have to get QI's crown.  I figure we'll have at least one more 'in the loop but not particularly high stakes' arc before we start gearing up for the finale in the real world.

  All-in-all, this chapter was one of the most enjoyable in quite a while and I'm looking forward to seeing the consequences of getting partially soul-energy-blasted, since last time this happened it ended up with Zorian hitching a ride in the loop.
  ```

  - u/I-want-pulao:
    ```
    Stakes had to return at some point. I'm not sure how many chapters remain (the author is cagey about it as well) so you never do know... At the same time, you're right that the Rod remains and until then, people are safe.

    Unless the author decides to kills or make otherwise unavaliable Xvim or Alanic. Things were progressing too smoothly...
    ```

    - u/ricree:
      ```
      As I understand it, even the complete destruction of an unmarked soul will just get reset at the next start. So Xvim and Alanic should be ok.

      Zorian I expect to be well, if not unscathed, but I suspect that Zach might not have been so lucky. It's possible that Zorian will be alone again for a time, if not indefinitely.
      ```

      - u/throwawayIWGWPC:
        ```
        Precisely my thoughts. Zorian saved himself but still felt some effects. If Zach was closer to the blast, he probably ate it harder than Zorian.

        I don't think it'll happen, but here's the kicker: What if Zach ate it hard? As in, he's comatose for the remaining loops hard? But Zach is so fun, I definitely would not enjoy that. :P

        And then, and then . . . Zorian saves *both* of them because he's a true friend of Zach, but then when he exits the loop, RR was Zach all along! The twist is real! Zachorian was never meant to be . . . /s
        ```

        - u/Florac:
          ```
          > And then, and then . . . Zorian saves both of them because he's a true friend of Zach, but then when he exits the loop, RR was Zach all along! The twist is real! Zachorian was never meant to be . . . /s

          I know there's /s, but we saw RR and Zach in the same room before Zach could summon Simulcrams.
          ```

          - u/throwawayIWGWPC:
            ```
            Right---that was the reason for the /s, but just to mess with you, **if Zach is Red Robe, then Zach knew how to cast simulacra all along, but due to memory shenanigans or maybe skilled method acting, Zach couldn't remember how or pretended to be unable to cast the spell!**

            Remember---Zach *admitted* to finding the simulacrum scroll *years ago*, so maybe when we saw RR and Zach in the same room, we actually just saw Zach and his simulacrum!

            In reality, that theory is not likely at this point because of how simulacra work: Simulacra are linked to the original's soul, so if RR or Zach is just a simulacrum, then when RR left the loop, Zach's soul would have left too because they would share the same soul. In other words, after Red Robe left the loop in chapter 26ish, Zach should have become a lifeless husk just like Veyers and the Aranea---at least, that what makes sense to me.
            ```

            - u/Nimelennar:
              ```
              Or, at least would have reverted to pre-loop Zach.

              Or, if it's all been a masquerade on Zach's part, and he is RR, then someone *else* has exited the loop.
              ```

            - u/LordGoldenroot:
              ```
              Also souls don't work like that. In the one of the worldbuilding posts it is mentioned that when you get better at magic it is you soul getting better, not your mind and only the gods could mess with that. Additionally, I find it hard to believe that Zach could fake being of a vastly lower skill level in soul perception than he was for so long. Even if Zorian would not have noticed Alanic would have surely noticed something being off sooner or later.
              ```

      - u/Alestor:
        ```
        A theory I have is when QI learned of the loop from mind raping Xvim, he decided to adhere some of his soul to Z&Z with the detonation, knowing that ultimately it wouldn't cost him anything as a fake entity. 

        I imagine Zorian would proably end up with a significant knowlege boost, and possibly even the divine blessing out of that, but as a main character would have enough plot armor to not be overwhelmed in mind. Zach on the other hand might start having a split personality issue and become a real threat for Zorian as QI encroaches on his soul.

        It'd be a cool place to take this, since it would put a real lasting threat for Zorian, but its probably going to just be a theory since the price of Zach would be too high and the power boost would probably be a bit much (but would offset the loss of Zach)
        ```

        - u/-Fender-:
          ```
          I think that Zach might be out of the story until they're out of the loop. He might have been really hurt by that blast.
          ```

      - u/I-want-pulao:
        ```
        I agree with you (I've remarked elsewhere on the loop essentially killing all non-loopers each repitition). What I meant was that Zach and Zorian need to lose something that is important to them during the endgame.
        ```

  - u/sambelulek:
    ```
    I've got to disagree on your first paragraph. It most likely unintended, but author has a theme going. Namely, the protagonist will enjoy victories big and small as the story goes, but something outside his knowledge screw him big way by the arc's end. In this chapter, we aren't told what's the consequences of QI soul detonation. If it screw ZZ big way next chapter, then that will mark the arc's end.  

    Still, this chapter cuts above many others.
    ```

  - u/icesharkk:
    ```
    That much soul damage is going to result in a lot of lost restarts. And likely zach or zorian will be down longer than the other. Leaving one of them to collect all the pieces in the remaining (3ish) restarts and carry the unconscious one out of the sovereign gate.
    ```

- u/karsyutain:
  ```
  So Zorian's strange danger sense again. 

  It first appeared in chapter 4
  > ... he almost failed to notice one of the winter wolves attacking Zach had stealthily broken off from the main pack and was sneaking up on him. Almost. Thankfully, some primal instinct alerted him to the danger and he threw himself to the side, narrowly avoiding the creature's deadly pounce.

  Next is ch 34.
  >And then, two weeks into the restart, he woke up in the middle of the night to see a black-clad figure with an obscure face and a knife in their hand standing over his bed.
  >
  >Later on, he would wonder what had tipped him off that he was in danger, but in that moment he simply reacted.

  And then ch 83. 
  >later, Zorian would wonder what exactly tipped him off and made him immediately activate his marker's restart switch when realized Quatach-Ichl was rushing at them.

  And another thing. On the surface, it doesn't looks like other cases, but I highly suspect this example might relate to above cases. 

  In ch 35. When Zorian met Sword Divers.

  >Zorian almost lost consciousness as nine attacks slammed into his mental shield, crushed it like an egg and then ripped straight into his unprotected mind. the pain was excruciating...(omit)
  >
  >He felt his muscles lock up as an alien mind seized his motor control away from him and started rooting in his head for facts and memories. He had to do... something... had to...

  >suddenly an image flashed before him, of two necklaces hanging from his neck, one of them inscribed with the defensive spell that ultimately failed him and the other that contained...

  >his mind suddenly snapped back into place, his course of action clear. Activate the suicide rings, that's what he had to do.
  ```

  - u/throwawayIWGWPC:
    ```
    Can we not chalk this up to him being an empath? Are you suggesting he may have some kind of inborn natural divination ability as well?
    ```

    - u/karsyutain:
      ```
      I've considered the possibility that it's the ability of the empath. But if that were the case, wouldn't the author reveal it directly? Instead, It seems like the author constantly just hinted it over and over. So I thought may be there's something hidden in the Zorian with danger sense.
      ```

      - u/throwawayIWGWPC:
        ```
        You could be right, but I don't think the author would necessarily reveal it directly. Narration never deviates from 3rd person with access to Zorian's head. If Zorian doesn't think back to those events with enough clarity to realize what happened, then the story wouldn't reveal anything about those events. I think that might be what's happening.

        But again you could be right and it would be an interesting twist. I feel coincidentally having empathic abilities was already a massive deus ex machina, so to be honest, I would sort of resent yet another inborn power like that. Honestly, as much as I *love* all the mind magic shennanigans and wouldn't change it, on principal I generally dislike those kinds of inborn power-ups in main characters.
        ```

        - u/The_Magus_199:
          ```
          Eh, I was okay with the empathy because it came early and was foreshadowed in the first loop; I’d definitely be a little eehhh on another inborn power showing up now though.
          ```

    - u/sambelulek:
      ```
      In a glance, they sound like a Deus Ex (or some trope I can't name). But author won't repeatedly mention that if they're just a device to keep the story going. Keen eye, u/karsyutain! I guess we might get our answer in future chapters.
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        Plot armor is the trope you're thinking of. The fact it is unexplained after the fact is interesting though.
        ```

  - u/distrofijus:
    ```
    it may also be attributed to the "killing intent". It is sorta negative emotion - someone wants to kill you. Zorian is a very perceptive mind mage/empath and this is a very powerful emotion.
    ```

  - u/icesharkk:
    ```
    I think it's too late in the story to reveal a new character super power. This is probably the climax of the plot: do to being unconscious from the soulboom the boys only have 3 more months to escape. No more time for boring training of new latent magical talents.
    ```

  - u/AKAAkira:
    ```
    Being an empath does include better reception of divination results in general, because being an empath means having a mind framed to better "accept" that input. Spear of Resolve even mentioned way back when that an "occasional prophetic dream" is one of the things that come with being "Open". I think we can chalk this up to his empath abilities - a kind of extremely short-term death divination that acts as an inconsistently-activated "danger sense".
    ```

  - u/vallar57:
    ```
    Add to the list his ability to predict whether Xvim was going to throw marbles at his head or to the side even before he learned the mana cloud trick. It can't be attributed to his empathy because a mind shild blocks it.

  - u/akaltyn:
    ```
    I'm wondering, Zorian originally joined the time loop via QI messing with his and Zach's souls, what are the chances that QI used this oppurtunity to put himself into the loop? If he wasn't scary enough imagine him in every loop hunting them
    ```

    - u/Nimelennar:
      ```
      I'd say "nonexistent."  Being able to detect, examine, exactly reproduce, and imprint a complicated soul marker, at a moment's notice, in combat?  From an opponent whose soul is shielded?  In the time it takes Zorian to press the reset button?

      No, I don't think that's likely.  If QI could do that, he would have already done so when he had access to another looper (Red Robe).

        Zorian seems to have handled the situation really well on his end, though. But he has better soul defenses than Zach does. It's possible that Zach will be out of commission for the rest of the loop, until Zorian exits.

    - u/thrawnca:
      ```
      > what are the chances that QI used this oppurtunity to put himself into the loop?

      No, *he still didn't realise what was going on*. He thought that somehow they'd trapped him in an illusion, which is why he had such a hard time believing it; his skills would make it extremely difficult to ensnare or fool him that way.

      He apparently doesn't know about the Sovereign Gate. Presumably he knows the legend, given his interest in the imperial artefacts, but he doesn't know what the Gate really does, not enough to recognise what had happened.
      ```

      - u/akaltyn:
        ```
        Immediately before the explosion he did a memory probe on Xvim, which presumably gave him whatever he knows about the time loop
        ```

      - u/Nimelennar:
        ```
        I got the impression that he learned (enough of) the truth from the Xvim mind-probe; he started talking more sensibly afterwards.  Or, at least, until he detonated.

        But as I've said elsewhere, at that point, I don't think he had the opportunity to get into the loop before it ended.
        ```

      - u/09eragera09:
        ```
        He did know, tho. He read Xvim's mind. He even referenced it by saying that people like him didn't really matter, as only ZZ would persist after a reset, which is why he blew his own soul up to take them down
        ```

        - u/thrawnca:
          ```
          Yeah, but at that point, he had about 10 seconds to work, maximum. No way did he work out how to forge a Controller marker in that time.
          ```

          - u/09eragera09:
            ```
            Of course, I wasn't disagreeing with you there
            ```

    - u/eSPiaLx:
      ```
      because its happened before, its technically possible for this explosion to put QI in the loop. However, that's stupid, because its been stated multiple times that Zorian getting into the loop is supposed to be something like the ultimate coincidence, unrecreateable. We are told the creators of the marker are smart enough to put in many safeguards, to prevent this EXACT case of transferring markers. So if 2 consecutive soul attacks bring 2 people into the loop.. that's BS and a bad plot gimmick.
      ```

      - u/Mountebank:
        ```
        But Red Robe also got in somehow, so it's been done twice so far.

        - u/RiOrius:
          ```
          I'm betting (slash hoping) that's due to something more interesting than "freak soul magic explosion."
          ```

        - u/Saffrin-chan:
          ```
          We already know there's a built in method to (temporarily) add someone to the loop for a few months. I think the dominate theory about Red Robe right now is that Zack gave him a temporary marker and he somehow subverted it to be added permanently. This theory still has the question of how Red Robe was able to subvert the temporary marker, though.
          ```

          - u/Sceptically:
            ```
            I'm betting Red Robe subverted it with the help of QI. After all, how else is an otherwise mediocre mage going to get that done in a hurry?

            So he gets QI's help with either making the temporary marker permanent, or just resetting its counter each loop (hence explaining why Red Robe was initially helping QI).

      > what are the chances that QI used this oppurtunity to put himself into the loop?

      I want to offer more elementary answer: It's not controller's soul found itself attached to the Lich's soul. The most that can happen is the other way around: the controller get ahold of Lich's soul. Therefore, QI won't be looping. There's nothing in his soul to instruct looping mechanism.
      ```

  - u/Dismalward:
    ```
    They really don't need to defeat him but just take his crown. Even though its harder than getting the ring, they are really ramming themselves against a wall trying to strong-arm an issue that should be  done easier with tricking the lich. Just try alot of options until one sticks otherwise they will keep running into the whole self destruct soul thing.
    ```

    - u/PresentCompanyExcl:
      ```
      Well he can transfer his soul between bodies, but not the crown. So the crown must have been sitting in an unused body. The only visible defences was one guard. I'm sure there are more defences but but it sounds like a good start to a trick.

      Of course he might have been lying about that, and he just teleported there.
      ```

- u/xamueljones:
  ```
  I feel like QI's denotation of his soul was an intelligent move rather than a suicidal one. QI knew that no matter what he does, ZZ could do nearly anything to him with the help of the time loop. Once they get out, they have extensive knowledge on him while he's utterly ignorant of two adult mages in the body of innocuous teenagers. And there's no changing that whatever he does in that moment.

  However, there's a version of him who is still well-off. The version of him one month ago. And all he needs to do to save that version of him...is to destroy their souls.

  So I believe the soul-bombing wasn't *just* a desperate act, but also a move to ensure a version of him will be very well-off after the time loop is over with all but one of the controllers dead. Also, some people seem to think he knows Red Robe even if he doesn't know about the time loop.
  ```

  - u/throwawayIWGWPC:
    ```
    I completely agree that his soul detonation was strategic rather than desperate. I didn't think of the implications with Red Robe, but I'm really curious what learning of the time loop means for his current relationship with Red Robe---assuming he has an existing relationship with Red Robe at the beginning of the month.

    Souls can't be destroyed.

    However, they can be mutilated.

      Well, souls can't usually be destroyed---unless you're the Sovereign Gate and it's that time of the month again. :P

          I don't think we got the answer without a shadow of a doubt, but I take the Gurdian's lack of correction to be implicit confirmation.

          > **"When an iteration is over, everything in it is destroyed,"** the Guardian began. Well, good to have that confirmed… Zorian had assumed it was so for a while now, but having the Guardian verify it was nice. "Under certain philosophical outlooks, this could be viewed as mass murder…"

    Except that the other thing they still need from QI is more experience fighting him.  They expect that to escape the loops, they will need to be able to defeat him in combat and take the crown before he can escape with it - which they still haven't managed to do yet.  They have a limited number of restarts remaining to test working combat strategies against him before they run out of time.

      Thing is they don't really need to combat the lich as long as they could recreate the situation where Zorian used the coin trick which sounds hell a lot easier than fighting a 1000 year old lich (who they learnt now that can soul detonate himself). They don't need to throw the coin themselves as well but just use another student.

      - u/thrawnca:

        Which they can't. It depended on getting close to QI, and drawing his attention, while letting him believe that they're harmless. Pretty difficult to reproduce at the best of times, and consider how they'd have to put everything else on hold for it to work.

        - u/Dismalward:

          Well they don't need to use the coin themselves so long as the coin hits QI. They don't even need to put anything else on hold as long as they had that happen with a friend or mind-controlled person. Obviously they only do it at the end of the restart so QI doesn't mess them after the fact it fails but it could work if Zorian didn't have any hang ups about long term mind control. 

          QI isn't as good at mind control as Zorian and they only need to do trial and error of throwing the coin at him via a proxy/different settings to see what sticks. Tbh he should have started on this as soon as he learnt QI had the crown but they keep wanting to strong-arm this entire situation. Its not a waste as long as they are doing other things and I find it wasteful they went through so many restarts learning QI has the crown yet not trying anything on him (as far as we know). It only has to be during the invasion like i said to be safe.

They only need to do the one attempt per restart and its not like they have any other death defying ideas to do on their last day. It doesn't even need to be them and its not like leaving the lich alone for mutiple restarts was smart of them when they could at least try.

                Keep reading; Zach went on to say that he *had* tried to throw items at QI in the past, and QI is expert at deflecting or even returning them.

                The odds of them getting past his defences in that regard within their remaining iterations are too low to warrant the risk of facing him. Just look at what happened this time; ZZ may be a while recovering.

                Being very generous, I'll allow that they might have a 1% chance of surprising him and dispelling him each time they try. But they might also have a 10% chance or more of having him get suspicious and hit them with enough soul magic to do them lasting harm. And the more they gear up for the confrontation (like warding their souls), the worse their chances of taking him off guard.

                  Idea:

                  Attempt to replicate this restart's palace heist with QI. If successful, repeat the gate to Xlotic.

                  Ahead of time, put down a plate enchanted the same way as Kael's coin right where the gate exits into Xlotic.

                  Humans rarely take notice of what is directly below them, so QI may not realize what he's stepping on. If he does notice (which I would expect seeing as be would be on high alert stepping through an unknown portal), fight him as planned. If he doesn't notice, well---now you have a crown and a dagger as huge payoff for a plan that was improbably successful.

                  The thing I'm saying is that they don't need to do it but make someone far less imposing do it probably a fellow student. If its happened before with Zorian then they can do it with someone else just need to set it up properly and try to manufacture a situation that take advantage of QI's arrogance. Then just keep repeating that scenario every restart they want to take his crown.


                  Doesn't them taking the ring or defeating QI the first time tell you that you don't always need to use brute force to get something. QI is even diplomatic that they can offer to give him the same things red robe gave the invasion in the past in order to let down his guard and learn more stuff about him.

      ```
      The problem is: this isn't useful combat experience. The QI they are fighting now knows that something funny is going on and is mainly using soul magic and mind magic attacks. Not to mention he has to go easy on them with the lethality of his magics otherwise they die and he gets no mind/soul to read. In contrast, normal QI will be using straight up kill magic attacks, which is an entirely different beast. So the experience they gained in this battle isn't going to match up with the battle they have planned with normal QI.
      ```

      - u/throwawayIWGWPC:
        ```
        But imagine the soul detonation hadn't occurred. If they could induce this sort of situation every restart and reliably incapacitate QI, then they would have a way to get the dagger *and* crown and they'd have four of five keys. One more key and their exit path is secured. By then, the only remaining hurdle would be to have a solution for fighting QI normally to permanently end his threat---which they could also practice---but remember is a whole other project in itself because it involves destroying his phyactery. If they just want to end the invasion, they could instead try to sabotage the creation of QI's special gate structure, which I think they already know results in the Ibasans just giving up.

        I think the risk was maybe worthwhile---though I agree that it probably would have been safer to just prefer fighting QI normally to avoid the dangers of soul shennanigans.

    Quite frankly he's a bit underwhelming to me. Zorian is powerful with 10 real years of mage experience, a very good work ethic, and 1 natural gift. Zach is stupidly powerful with a (presumed)divine blessing and 65 years of mage of experience. QI has two divine blessings, the crown, a 1000 years of mage experience, and no morals holding him back in anyway. Presumably he also has a good work ethic too and put those years to good work. He should be an absolutely unstoppable monster.

      He basically is though, within the limits of the universe. Against 5 mages of extremely high caliber, with no preparation, on ground prepared by the enemy who have intricate knowledge of his abilities, he was more than holding them off. He seemed to not even consider escape, even when he already had the dagger. The only reason he suicided was because he saw from Xvim's memories (remember, the archmage who specializes in magic defense) that fighting was pointless.

        He's basically a Swiss watchmaker's fetish. God only knows what his specialty is, but he comes off as a crossbreed between Zach and Xvim. With some of Silverlake's more exotic aspects.

        I suppose post timeloop they might offer him the 'keys' to the treasury to frame another nation for the break-in instead of launching an invasion where his precious troops are killed. Fighting him is a bit of a null game.

        I wonder if the damage to their souls from this might lose them additional restarts, like when the original mutilation happened?

          Why do they need to break into the vault post loop?  
          The whole reason they are breaking into the vault is because of the loop so after the loop there is minimal incentive to do it in the real world.

          - u/notagiantdolphin:
            ```
            I assume they'll want to prevent the invasion of C after they escape, assuming they don't return at the end of the timeloop. The vault seems like the safest way to do it instead of fighting the terrifying skeleton man.

            - u/Menolith:

              Yes, it has powerful artifacts, but Z&Z can find those in every nook and cranny nowadays. More conventional preparation has proven to be highly effective and it doesn't require them to break into the most highly guarded area they know of.

                Like I said, it's not about what they get out of it. It's because they give Q-I a chance to trigger a war *without* the invasion. Q-I wants to trigger the war and make Firn win. So they break into the place, plant evidence implicating F. Q-I gets to save the lives of his soldiers, who he apparently values. He gets to plant some evidence implicating another nation. He gets whatever he can carry off. C isn't invaded. 

                Well, not immediately, anyway. Maybe in the future. But by another nation, and not a military action that involves a terrifying undead wizard with a thousand years of experience.

      He only seems non-threatening because of the fundamental limitation of soul magic- that it's slow/clumsy in offense, which means despite his thousand years of experience QI can't actually just snap his fingers and wipe out ZZ's souls.

      He invested all those years into defensive and utility magics. Hence hasting, personal Bakora gates, lich magics, etc. With all the simulacrums and fake bodies he's pretty much impossible to kill. His offense is weak because he probably didn't think he would need them to be any stronger than they already are. 

      > and no morals holding him back in anyway. 

      QI does have morals, it's established that he is just from an ancient time when values are different, more based on honor than human rights. He actually cares about his country and his people, though he is incredibly strict on them. So that means he won't go around performing human experiments on his people or can't take reckless actions that might provoke other countries to declare war on his country, not without decades of meticulous planning.

        And let's be real, we're using the word "weak" in a very skewed sense; homeboy is a walking artillery platform. When he isn't just using soul magic---which is inefficient to cast in battle---he can usually single-handedly stand toe-to-toe with an army of mages as we've seen in the past: and we're talking about an army of mages being led by two timelooping archmages pretty familiar with how he fights *plus* Xvim and Alanic.

      QI was greatly handicapped by the fact that he knew he couldn't properly hurt ZZ with physical attacks, while they were free to launch anything they pleased. He probably could have killed their bodies, but he could guess that that wouldn't work - plus, he wanted information.

      And although his mana reserves were greater than all his opponents combined, their group would have had greater total casting speed.

          He knew about the reset, though, thanks to Xvim's memories. By blowing up his soul, he trades a few days or weeks of life in exchange for wiping away two serious adversaries who could seriously threaten his plans.

          Take things back to exactly how they were before the loop, and he is still an ancient and powerful lich. Zack and Zorian, on the other hand, are just teenage students.
          ```

          - u/GodKiller999:
            ```
            Never said it was a bad decision, but if he'd been tricked and everything was 'real' he'd very much be dead. His decision was logical knowing that he'd be doomed anyway at the end of the iteration.

              It'd be really funny if in the last month, Zorian gained the ability to do deep brain edits, edited Xvim's mind temporarily (questionable) so Xvim would *believe* a loop was occurring, then recreated what happened in this loop.

              QI, invading Xvim's mind and believing he's in a loop, decides to self-detonate, thus permanently committing suicide. Tricksy hobitses!

              PS: I in no way endorse this plan. Casual deep edits of a mentor on the off chance everything goes according to plan isn't my idea of a reliable strategy.

      Diminishing returns are a thing.  Plus just because QI is a powerful mage does not mean he has super powered multitasking - fighting multiple talented mages by himself requires much more effort than fighting 1 at a time in sequence.
      ```

    - u/Negatively_Positive:

      He fought not only ZZ but also Xvim, Alanic, and Silverlake who all are very powerful. Considering they almost defeated him before few tries ago, the outcome is not surprising.
      ```

- u/throwawayIWGWPC:
  ```
  Here's an interesting idea:

  What if QI's soul suicide leaves a lasting scar on ZZs' souls that will be instantly recognizable to QI (just like how Sudomir recognized Zorian fiddling with his soul marker), thus barring recruiting his help (or at least acting as a warning sign for him) for several restarts if not into perpetuity?

  Well, we'll have to tune in next time to find out! It'll be something to keep in mind if they meet QI off the battlefield again---and even then, I feel he wouldn't act immediately upon seeing such a scar but use the scar as a clue that he would bring up later.

  Another theory:

  His soul explosion actually fused small shards of his soul onto theirs. The small shards perhaps don't have any lasting effect other than to mark them, which again would make QI instantly suspicious upon seeing them again.

  The ring's soul tracking marker would be a neat way to find QI's phylactery and hopefully figure out a quick and dirty way to end him outside the loop.  

  Fun thing from rereading- Zach knocks off the crown in chapter 26.
  ```

  - u/sambelulek:
    ```
    Uhh..., I think ring's inability to be used that way is addressed in this very chapter. Ring is not available to ZZ at the beginning of the loop.  

    I also noticed Zach ability to knock off the crown in one of my rereading. I was waiting for somebody to bring it up. So, do you think knocking it off could equal to steal them away?
    ```

    - u/throwawayIWGWPC:
      ```
      Not to mention that in the chapter, it says placing a soul tracker on a soul mage is instantly recognizable, so the tactic would not work on QI even if they could place the tracker on him in the middle of the month after getting the ring.

      As far as knocking off the crown is concerned, that would be an interesting idea. If they could fight such that Zorian is hidden somewhere, if during the fight everyone could focus on hitting the crown, maybe a well-placed gate spell when the crown falls would allow Zorian to retrieve it. However, I feel depending on stealing the crown mid-battle like that would be too unreliable, but maybe they could try it.
      ```

      - u/FlameSparks:
        ```
        If they can manage to use the coin trick on QI while a tracker is on him, they would know where the phylactery which would be an insta-win from then on. The biggest problem with this is that since the tracker can exist over multiple loop and they can't abort the spell, QI knows something is happen every restart.
        ```

        - u/throwawayIWGWPC:
          ```
          That's a really good point!

          Hmm . . . we'll have to see if the tracker indeed exists over multiple loops as this was the first loop they've used the ring.
          ```

      - u/Saffrin-chan:
        ```
        Well, the ring wouldn't "work" in the sense that QI would instantly know something had been done to his soul, but he probably wouldn't be able to remove it. The only reason they were able to remove divine tracking from their souls this chapter was that they were able to get out of range so the tether snapped on its own. If the ring's range is 'everything inside the time loop,' then QI wont be able to get out of range. So using the ring tracking on him has a trade-off of immediately putting him on alert for the entire loop, but when they do get the ring a week after the loop starts, they'll be able to find him anywhere. But I don't think that's a good trade-off for them, because as long as they keep the loops somewhat consistent they'll always know about where QI will be anyway, and being able to fight him when he's not on extreme alert seems more important than tracking him on the off chance something causes him to greatly change his schedule.
        ```

        - u/throwawayIWGWPC:
          ```
          I think I was imagining that when a soul mage knows they've been marked, they would be able to remove said mark. If QI wouldn't be able to remove it, then that's a different story. Of course, in that case as you say QI would no longer be acting normal, which defeats the purpose for him at least.
          ```

          - u/Dismalward:
            ```
            Well I imagine QI isn't all powerful since he wasn't able to remove the tether they got from breaking into the vaults which is divine in origin so if the artifact works on the same divine level then they might be able to track him. They'll just trick him with the coin and they should be good unless the QI is sufficiently powerful enough to redirect where his soul goes to when his "defenses" activate from the coin trick.


            It seems alot easier going that route than fighting him over and over which might be pointless unless they can destroy those skull things and be able to keep his soul in place under the wards that silverlake promised.
            ```

  - u/DerSaidin:
    ```
    This is what I was thinking.

    1. Make thousaof those coins Zorian used once before to disconnect QI from his body, but make them the size of sand. Scatter them around planned dimensional gate exit - all over the ground, in the breeze, everywhere.
    2. Tag QI soul with the ring just as he steps through the dimensional gate. If he notices and tries to stop, be ready to blast him through the gate.
    3. In the rest of this restart, while you do have the ring, track QI soul to his phylactery
    4. Repeat over multiple restarts, sending a simulacrum towards the phylactery before you start each time. Each restart starts tracking from closer than before.
    5. Go ask QI nicely for the crown. When he laughs, threaten him with the exact location of his phylactery.
    6. When he still refuses and starts trying to kill you, have your Alanic-and-friends strike team attack his phylactery so he has to abandon the body with crown to defend it.

  This is a wonderful birthday present for me, despite it not being April 20th yet!

  Also, I *really* don't like Silverlake acting as if people sticking to their ethics are babies or stupid for doing so. I bet the ideas she has about abusing the timeloops revolve around stealing or tricking others into doing research for you in various ways.

  Edit: I seem to have sparked off a discussion about whether or not Zorian and Zack are foolish for 'handicapping' themselves by ignoring unethical actions. Since it's too late to weigh in properly, I only would like to point out that the disagreements seem to boil down to arguing whether utilitarian (the ends justify the means) or deontological (the ends *don't* justify the means) ethics are better.

  Yes, yes, it's an oversimplification of two complex moral philosophies, but I needed a pithy summary of the two.

      The problem is that the only things that can change in the loop are the two of them.  Meaning that if they become more ruthless inside the loop, it might create habits which are difficult to break when consequences affecting other people become real again.

        Well consequences don't matter at all if they can't get out of the loop. Why handicap yourself further when there's a chance you might permanently die if you do that? Sounds pretty stupid to me. 


        One way or another one of them is going to make it out of the loop given that they are the main characters but it's still pretty stupid to make things harder to yourself when solving a serious problem.

            Why even Zorian might even be able to defeat the lich without needing to be there if he becomes proficient in the long-term mind magic since he could have the mind control person try to recreate the events which Zorian himself did to defeat the lich(throwing the coin at the lich because the mind-controlled person look ultimately harmless also the lich himself could hardly tell since he isn't nearly as proficient at mind magic as Zorian). They don't even need to be there in person and only show up after the fact to reap the rewards then immediately run away but they won't do that because of the morality of long term mind magic.

      I like this novel but this honestly has to be one of my biggest peeves with it.

Not being willing to go even in the slightest outside their comfort zone is neither pragmatically moral or selfish. It's just self-handicapped squeamishness.

    ```

    - u/throwawayIWGWPC:
      ```
      I think we're arguing that the skill is extremely worthwhile for limited scenarios and thus worth training.

      To give a somewhat contrived example, say Eldemar is trying to exercise eminant domain over some shifter territory. I could buy the shifter group time to muster a more permanent legal solution or otherwise broker a better deal if I could magically compel several officials to delay or drop the case outright. My point is that there are instances where the ability would allow for a more moral outcome---and some of us argue that there may be ways to practice the skill that would not push Zorian's moral boundaries very far.
      ```

  - u/Dismalward:
    ```
    Your thinking makes sense that I cannot see why Zorian hasn't tried it earlier. Maybe it the author's way of not making them overpowered by making them squeamish and have them immediately reject the idea so it cannot be used to bypass a problem he wants solved another way.
    ```

- u/throwawayIWGWPC:
  ```
  Regarding compulsion mind magic:

  Morally speaking, I wouldn't have an issue with learning the skill. I would practice mostly on animals, which I really dislike animal experimentation, but I think the situation justifies it. (If you think the ends never justifies the means, I believe you're incorrect but let's discuss it.)

  I would practice doing things like compelling birds to once a day chirp at my window if they are nearby (so they aren't compelled to leave their home it they usually live elsewhere), or having a friend say "Zach smells funny" every time they see me, and other relatively benign things---with consent of course.

  If learning the skill involved breaking minds, I would start with cultists and have them report news to me or something. I would eventually practice having cultists sabotage things on the day of the invasion. Imagine several hundred cultists each with a small explosive device from Zorian who could, for example, destroy key parts of the invasion. It would be very useful and could save a lot of lives---even cultist lives if the logistics of the invasion were sufficiently disrupted to make them give up.

  Outside the loop, it would be useful for dealing with baddies in a way where nobody dies and people just go to jail, though Zorian can kind of do that now in a limited sense, he could probably do it more effectively. I think there are unique uses for the skill that would be invaluable and not require Zorian to injure his moral compass, which is a sentiment I do appreciate.

  I think a major issue with learning the discipline is that Zorian hasn't found a teacher and few Aranea even know how to do it and fewer still would be willing to admit they know how.

  I'm betting QI exploded his soul so that he would fuse some of his soul fragments into Zack or Zorian. Zack is going to be in the clear probably because of how sensitive his marker is, but Zorian's going to have a sizable portion of QI stuck inside him.

  I bet QI thinks his soul fragments might be enough to take over Zorians soul and make Zorian more like him. His way of vicariously surviving despite the fact that this isn't the real world.

  On the plus side, Zorian might get more mana and some ancient Lich magical powers assuming he manages to keep his personality intact.

    ```
    Hehe we had similar ideas mere minutes apart. The fallout would be really bizarre if either Zorian or Zach get affected in that way . . .
    ```

- u/ceegheim:
  ```
  What a pity, I would so much have hoped for a possible long term understanding between ZZ and QI.

  I mean, if ZZ manage to escape the timeloop, then it is in QI's best interest to peacefully cancel the invasion, before it is discovered (if Eldemar is not crushed, then the backlash is not worth the hassle; and ZZ can damage QI's plan enough to become counterproductive). If they can get QI to abort the invasion peacefully once out of the timeloop, then it is in their interest to do this. Hence, QI has an interest in providing ZZ with contact info and proof that would be convincing to QI, and ZZ have an interest (in the real world) of using it. 

  If ZZ manage to escape, then QI has an interest in (1) obtaining time-loop info and more importantly (2) having a workable relationship and trust-base with the new ZZ power in the world. Their acquired knowledge (Bakora gate information, where to find the imperial artifacts) is priceless, even for QI. He can put good probability to them becoming important long-term players that might be more amenable to lobbying for a peace treaty (which is the thing QI wants to achieve with the invasion). I could even imagine him taking on Zorian as an apprentice and future Lich, post-timeloop and once Zorian is close to death. 

  On the other hand, ZZ emerging successfully from the loop without a working relationship with QI is his nightmare scenario. Hence, his preferences should be:

  (1) Subvert the timeloop [too unlikely to pursue], (2) see ZZ fail to escape, (3) have ZZ escape from the timeloop with QI's help and (4) have ZZ escape from the loop against QI.

  ZZ's preference order should be 3,4,2,1. 

  Both parties prefer 3 to 4, so there is room for trade/trust, but not easily due to the possibility of QI betraying ZZ or being less helpful than he appears to be. Also, there is an issue of haggling: How much knowledge do ZZ transfer across loops for QI, or otherwise trade him? How much knowledge that could be used against him is QI willing to divulge to ZZ? This is interesting! (but apparently not happening)
  ```

  - u/throwawayIWGWPC:
    ```
    Great analysis. I'd rather set ZZ's preferece order as 4,3,2,1. ZZ have vocalized how they completely disagree with QI's approach. Not only that, but I feel both of them believe QI is too dangerous and wiley to cultivate a longterm cooperative relationship with. Their priorities ought to be:

    0. Exit the loop and survive.
    0. Halt the invasion.
    0. Find a way to end QI permanently.
    0. Barring ending QI, find a diplomatic solution.

    Outcome-wise, this is your 4,3,2,1.

    Unforunately, option 3: cooperation is so unstable. QI knows that ZZ don't trust him and he would probably admit that given the opportunity, he would betray them. After all, QI very plainly said to them at the initial meeting that he believes in maintaining power and peace through the threat of violence and so ZZ feel if QI could eventually find a way to remove the threat of ZZ, he would choose to do so---they're forced to assume that if QI is given enough time to conspire, he would eventually choose a zero-sum solution.

    QI realizes he cannot convincingly promise an option 3 even if that would be the best option for everyone, so all that is left for him is option 2---do his best to prevent ZZ from escaping. And if he fails? Well, ZZ exit the loop and stop the invasion. Even in that case, QI may still survive to fight another day if ZZ can't within the loop reliably figure out how to destroy QI's phylactery.

    If the above is QI's calculus, then I can see why he would choose to detonate himself, likely inducing a coma, death, or otherwise scarring them in a way he might be able to notice if they try to negotiate with him in subsequent loops. I do agree with you, though, that an alliance would be a lot of fun to read about and it's a pity QI generally views alliances as temporary until one power outmaneovers the other.

Even the aranea considered that kind of 'deep mind editing' to be sinister and repellent, to say nothing of himself. His specialty was telepathic combat and memory reading, not enslavement.

  - u/bassicallyboss:

    I agree that "immigrated" is probably more natural/common here.  But while "emigrated" is unusual in this context, I don't think it's wrong, strictly speaking.  It's all about whether the focus is on the place which is left (emigrate) or the destination (immigrate).  I didn't even notice that Quatach-Ichl had said anything unusual when I read this part, but if I had, it would have seemed perfectly in-character for an articulate, millennia-old lich.
    ```

    - u/throwawayIWGWPC:
      ```
      Maybe you're right, but I read this section and also felt it should be immigrate. The sentence in question can be expanded to read "if you emigrated [sic] to Ulquaan Ibasa". Immigrate to, emigrate from---and I justify it by looking at the prefixes. "In" means into and "ex" means out from.

      I think that's the correct way of writing it because the prefix "in" means "into" whereas "ex" means "out of".

      As for it being in-character,  the fact that we're even having this discussion supports your statement really well. However, I think it was an author error and that it is better corrected than not; most readers who happen to notice the error will think of it as a typo rather than assume that it was intentional.

  I like to think of MoL magic system as code, specially the soul magic field about markers and templates. I think QI soul bomb is a workaround against the Sovereign Gate loop, QI just hacked a mark on the timeloop to erase the template on his soul just as if it were SQL injection. This could be a pretty handy mechanism to protect oneself against loopers, as alternative to not engaging at all, I think ZZ souls are fine, but QI will be soul killed now and they won't learn more about him. It would be even cooler if all of their teachers are also wiped out of the time loop! A really nice and difficult situation for the story. Maybe that's why Demian wasn't included, the plot will need him for Blatyrre exploration.
  ```

  - u/eSPiaLx:
    ```
    That almost definitely isn't the case. First of all consider that QI only had like 30 seconds of prep. Second, the marker is designed to avoid tampering.
    ```

  - u/throwawayIWGWPC:
    ```
    I also think of the magic (in any system honestly) as programming.  While I think your theory has merit, I don't think it's the most stable way to program the loop mechanism.

    In my mind, the Sovereign Gate keeps a template of every soul it needs to recreate every loop. At the end of every (while!) loop, the Gate grabs all souls marked as controllers, then goes through each soul in its template and recreates it---unless the soul has a "soulkill" marker on it. If that's the case, then it doesn't matter what happens to non-controller souls in the loop because those souls are always trashed at the end of the month anyhow. This method is more stable because you're treating most of your soul data immutable in the form of a template. (Think of data safety as described in the Haskell language.)

    But yeah the Sovereign Gate program could work the way you mentioned. The Gate could inspect every soul in the loop, see if it has a "please replicate" marker, and only in that case make the replica. If QI destroyed his soul and thus destroyed that "please replicate" marker, then his soul detonation was a really good move. However, that would mean that certain types of soul mangling done within the loop would affect the souls in the next loop, which I feel the designers of the Gate would have wanted to avoid.

    ```

    - u/distrofijus:
      ```
      Would it be possible for you to elaborate on some points of the story (if they are not going to be explained in the future):


      1. "Since it was extremely difficult for a controller with an intact marker to unlock their soul perception through classical means, it made sense for the Shutur-Tarana to prepare a workaround for his successor."
      The story so far was that Shutur-Tarana established an empire. Does this imply that Sovereign Gate was actually created by him (he was actual god who decided to establish empire just for fun or whatever, not the person who discovered old relic). 
      2. Any particular reason for Z&Z not to put the golems into the orb (or any other opposing factions). It's a huge walking prison/temporary, useful detainment/sorting facility.  
      3. Why Z&Z didn't bring like 10-20-50-100-200 golems into the fight/ambush for QI? 
      4. While the QI is very very powerful, Xvim is actual defense based archmage. It takes him brief moment to re-establish his non-structural magic defense. Also you've explained that mind blank is unnatural state and it can be dispelled. However it can be also said that there's a resemblance to the reason why dispel spell does not extinguish fire caused by fire spell (mind blank is sort of disconnect from great physic net in the same fashion as holding one's breath). Spell allows to achieve that state, but it goes beyond that and to remove unnatural state target needs to be affected in the way that it would revert unnatural state (like start breathing in surprise). 
      Xvim offered very little resistance. 
      5. Souls were supposed to be indestructible. The last stunt QI pulled kinda suggest that you can do pretty much anything to soul (it is like hologram - if you break it up, every tiny fragment contains the same image). It is very close to blurring the line between mangling the soul beyond recognize and actually destroying the soul
      ```

      - u/nobody103:
        ```
        1) No, Shutur-Tarana was not a god. The imperial artifacts were clearly made with the help of a god, but the first emperor probably had a lot of input into what his fancy set of magical tools would do and look like.

        2-3) It takes time for Zorian to make golems. He mostly ran out of them by the time they fought against QI.

        4) It takes just a moment for Xvim to re-establish his usual mental defenses, but those defenses aren't mind blank. They cannot stand up to QI's attack. Because the disconnect from the psychic net is so unnatural to mind, they immediately snap back to their natural state when the magic forcing them is gone. 

        5) They are. They have an indestructible core and an outer layer that is crucial for a person's existence but can be destroyed or modified. I don't want to explain what QI actually did, since it is slightly spoilerish, but he did not violate these principles in any way.

              Edit: oh god, or when he gives Hermione "The Talk." And by that I mean the "Evil Overlord Talk."

  Nice was just checking up on it! Love me a new chapter!

  Edit: Maybe Red Robe left the loop because not only of the new time travelers but the disappearance/soul kill of spider made the lich more suspicious of him. Damn Red Robe must have been quite capable to be able to deal with the lich without being easily enslaved with just one wrong move.
