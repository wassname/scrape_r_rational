## [TV|HSF|TH] Black Mirror

### Post:

*Black Mirror* is a Twilight-Zone-style scifi anthology series from Channel 4 in Britain.

**Why should I watch:** Each episode is different, but they all explore a different technology, more than once delving into AI, uploading, and transhumanism. The stories explore how people will use new tech, for good or for evil, and new tech will change society. It's the best television I've seen in a long time.

I hesitate to label this series as "rational," since few characters act 100% logically, but there aren't any idiot balls being passed around. There is no black-and-white morality anywhere, and all the characters are remarkably sympathetic (assisted, I'm sure, by the excellent acting). Either way, *Black Mirror* deserves a mention here.

**How to watch:** There are seven episodes, ranging in length from 45 to 75 minutes; they're available for streaming both on Netflix and on the less-reputable web. Be careful to steer away from discussions and spoilers, though. In the style of *Twilight Zone*, each story is very reliant on plot-twists and perspective-shifts, but the authors do a good job of making each state-change appear naturally, so there's no Shyamalan-esque breaking of suspension of disbelief.

**Warning:** The topic of the first episode, "The National Anthem", is quite icky, and I don't want to spoil anything, but the topic is named (thankfully never shown) in the first five minutes. So watch the first five minutes of S1E1 (available on youtube with 360p and Spanish subtitles [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUjVFaJzA0A)), and if you're intrigued, keep watching, but if you're really turned off just jump straight to S1E2, "15 Million Credits", which is where the series really hits its stride.

I mention this because a lot of people get turned away from the series by its first episode, when really it's atypical. "The National Anthem" is by far the most squick and least scifi of the series; the other stories are very different in topic and tone. So be better! If you turn away from the show, at least do it informedly!
