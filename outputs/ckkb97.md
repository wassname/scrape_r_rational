## [RT] Volume 1 complete! My Life is Not a Manga, or Maybe...

### Post:

I'm very pleased to announce that volume 1 of **My Life is Not a Manga, or Maybe...** is complete! If the premise sounds interesting (a normal high schooler literally stumbles through the fourth wall and discovers he is the protagonist of a manga), give it a read! It's quite short by internet fiction standards (a little over 60k words, so a slim light novel). *Familiarity with manga not required (and yes, that's why there's so much exposition in chapter 1).*

* Read it at [NotAManga.com](https://notamanga.com)
* Read it on [Royal Road](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/23126/my-life-is-not-a-manga-or-maybe)

I won't be publishing for the month of August while I deal with a complicated deployment at work and try to get a buffer established, but volume 2 should start rolling out the end of August or early September.

With that out of the way, allow me a brief digression. I attended the CFAR workshop a couple weeks back, and it was a fascinating experience. Aside from the personal benefits I derived from having almost a week to spend focused on and thinking about myself and my life (a rare commodity for me), I absolutely loved observing and participating in one of the shared narratives at the heart of the rationalist community. I doubt anyone--aside possibly from some of the instructors--would have thought about it in these terms, but we spent the whole time sharing stories. Stories about ourselves. Stories about how we understood the world. Stories about the future. Stories about the past. Stories about how to craft better personal stories.

One of the reasons I've always been driven to write is that for me, narratives are a core part of the human experience. The stories we tell ourselves and others not only serve to share knowledge or experience, but also influence our actions, patterns of thought, even what we are capable of thinking in the first place (and I consider story/narrative to be a very broad category; fiction certainly counts, but even things like, "I am a rational human being" are stories). For me, the big question at the heart of being a rational, decently-functioning human is, "What are the narratives I am telling myself? Which of them are actually true (or helpful)? How do I distinguish between them?" There's a reason that active listening (or Socratic ducking, if you're into the CFAR terminology) is such a powerful tool; I claim (ooooh, I'm talking the talk!) it's because you're verbalizing your own narrative, and a narrative that's verbal is much easier to understand and critique than one that's internal.

I started writing Not A Manga because I wanted to hold up a mirror, not to manga or the slice-of-life harem genre, but to myself. Why do I simultaneously enjoy these stories and find them repulsive? Would I want to live the fiction that I love so much? What happens when my own narratives run afoul of external narratives? What is necessary for a narrative that is faithful to a genre I am uncomfortable writing yet explicitly and implicitly critical of it?

I don't think I've answered those questions, but if you take the time to read Not A Manga, I would absolutely love to hear how the first volume of the story I'm spinning affected you. What did you enjoy? What was boring or displeasing? What (if anything) caused you to think or to dream?

- - - - -

And last but not least: Xavier spends a significant portion of this volume thinking and planning. Where did he screw up? (And I don't mean, "When did his plans go awry?" but "When did the way he was thinking about his problems fail him at a low level?") I have my own thoughts on the matter, but am very curious to hear yours. Please spoiler responsibly. :-)

  Congratulations on making it all the way through! Producing good writing is hard, and writing a complete novel without giving up is impressive.

  NotAManga was a little outside my normal strike zone, as I don't read manga myself and I therefore don't know the tropes that well. At points I found myself thinking "Why not just try dating Paula or Jill? Or, for that matter, just enjoy it, at least once he got Samantha out?" On the other hand, there are questions of free will -- the harem were all being forced to act in unnatural ways and show romantic interest in someone they might not have been romantically interested in otherwise, which is a little squicky. OTOH, they were clearly independent agents, since Jill could choose to simply exit the harem when she decided to.

  It was odd reading a work where the entire point was to *prevent* anything interesting from happening. It's like the hero's journey being actively stalled at the Refusing the Call stage. I'm glad I read it, although I'm not sure it could be sustained for another entire book. What are you planning to do for Volume 2 that will be different from Volume 1?

    I'm not sure what I can say without spoilers. :-)

    Suffice it to say that the stakes in volume 2 are completely different. At stake in volume 1 is Xavier's sense of autonomy/independence of self (and arguably integrity; things could have spiraled out of control fast if he'd tried dating all the girls at once, solicited sex from them in an attempt to cash out on his protagonist status, etc.). So the risks were mainly existential, and reasonably small in scope (for an external observer; he would undoubtedly argue otherwise). Xavier also had a support group/safety net (parents, and arguably some of the girls themselves) and the leisure to experiment.

    Volume 2 will force him into a situation where many of the things I mentioned in the previous paragraph are no longer true.

      A situation where he has no friends, family, or support network, and no time to experiment at his leisure?

      smells like isekai

  Okay, here are some comments. I'll put them in spoilers just in case.

  >!1. I felt that in some sense, Xavier wasn't really trying. His initial thoughts were more or less 'I want to get Emily back' and 'I want to get out of this manga'. Yet in practice, he was only aiming for the second (aside from a few half-hearted texts). I feel that there was at least some potential to aim for both, using the genre to help him, and he didn't even seem to think about it. Consider this. Your girlfriend was put on a bus by the manga, and you're surrounded by a harem. It's more or less guaranteed that if things go on long enough, your ex-girlfriend shows up to disrupt the status quo. Just make sure that one girl appears to be winning, and something is bound to happen. By law of conservation of detail, Emily's return is a very likely option.!<

  >!Of course, the above is at least sort of unfair towards the one girl you give the appearance of winning, so I can imagine Xavier dismisses it based on that. Or maybe he dismisses is because he wants Emily to be safe from the manga. Also, even if Emily gets back, there's bound to be some complication. But not even thinking about the option feels kind of thoughtless. !<

  >!2. I think Samantha's reveal was well done, and greatly increased the feel of the characters being real rather than stereotypes. !<

  >!3. The author on the other hand had plenty of options to throw a curveball with how Samantha was 'released from the harem'. Xavier appeared to genuinely want to help Samantha, and I imagine Samantha would be able to figure this out. I would say there's a decent chance she would actually start to appreciate him because of this, rather than being removed from the harem. Instead, Xavier's plan appeared to work perfectly. (Actually, I count this as 'the way Xavier was thinking about his problems failing him at a low level'. "I want to get rid of potential romantic interests? Let's do something to genuinely help them personally!"). I'll also make a little note here that the plan mostly worked because Jewel also happened to be into anime. Quite convenient. I'll come back to that. !<

  >!4. The harem in general didn't feel like much of a harem after Samantha. Samantha was just acting out, Paula just felt like someone who likes teasing, Rachel didn't indicate any romantic interest (aside from the blushing in chapter 2), leaving only Jill as a potential candidate. Xavier seemed to sort of pick up on that, but still kept thinking he was in a harem situation. Sure, he could think that there's actual romantic attraction deeply underneath all the facades, but it's getting more and more farfetched. !<

  >!5. Then Seamus shows up, solving Xavier's problem with Jill more or less automatically (Jill feels she's plain, and we get someone who is interested in her just from seeing her). At this point, all the warning bells in my head start going off. Either this is bad writing, or we've left the harem genre entirely. Xavier doesn't seem to notice that this is suspiciously convenient... Again. !<

  >!6. Regarding Paula. From the harem manga point of view, I expected her to be mildly impressed by Xavier initially, and for her teasing to become of a more serious nature as she grew closer to him. Instead, the teasing never seemed serious, and was directed at Samantha half of the time. She didn't seem to grow closer to Xavier at all, and around the Halloween party, I was partly suspecting that she would reveal herself to be a lesbian, using her obvious teasing of Xavier to try to hide that (this would also neatly explain why she wanted Xavier to pretend to be her date at the party). After the date, there's still a lot of mystery left, but again Xavier's problem resolves itself (and was apparently never a problem to begin with). !<

  >!7. Rachel is still a big mystery. Chapter 2 has her flush a lot; chapters  five and six flesh her out a bit, but after that, nothing much happens. It feels like she takes things in stride way too much; there seems to be very little emotion. The last two chapters hint at some romantic attraction, but it wasn't really visible otherwise. It's also unclear why she has such social manipulation skills. !<

  >!8. Did the Debbie plot just... get dropped? !<

  >!9. On the whole, it felt like there was very little challenge for the protagonist. Sure, he did some things, but there didn't seem to be any real challenges (aside from Samantha maybe), and there were no setbacks (unless you count Debbie). Things just... worked out. Anti-climax was sort of the point, but I at least expected Xavier to have to work for the anti-climax. Maybe some of the above points will come back with a vengeance next book of course. Still, I like to see a book, especially a first book in a series, stand on its own, while this one just seemed incomplete. !<

  >!10. Since the above might seem mostly negative, let me at least point out that I did finish the entire book, and took the time to write all of this. I'm sort of hesitant to start on the next book if it'll be very similar to this, but I do think there's a lot of potential in this series. !<


  P.S. In case it's relevant, I've read quite a few manga series, including some in the harem genre. In addition, I've spent a lot of time on tvtropes.

    Thank you so much for the in-depth critique! This is really useful feedback, particularly since I am planning to revise the story prior to publishing it and you’ve helped gel some of the issues that I’d been feeling myself but having trouble explicitly identifying when I was head down writing it week-to-week.

    Seriously, I can’t thank you enough for taking the time to leave such thorough feedback. I hope you will give the second book a shot when I start publishing it in a month, because it’s going to be quite a bit different (assuming all goes well; I’d really rather avoid books where it doesn’t feel like the protagonist has any real challenges).

  Congratulations on finishing. It was an interesting read; I’ve seen a few stories of this sort before, like https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/no-matter-what-happens-i-still-wont-become-an-anime-character.9848/, but this was a bit of a unique take on it. It’s also completed which is a plus; only two of the others in this category have finished a full plot that I remember. 

  Thanks for posting this here!
