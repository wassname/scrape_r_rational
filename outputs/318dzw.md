  >Anyway, we set up the test gate in orbit of Tellus (weâ€™d normally use Mars, but its orbit had come too close to Earth recently, so we went one planet further out)

  I cannot imagine this ending badly.

  (I guess in retrospect the HSF tag is a bit of an exaggeration. I tried to make the physics/engineering consistent but there's no real sense in which it's accurate)

  This is hilarious and awesome.  It also fits pretty well with the canon behavior of the ancients in terms of their irresponsiblity.

  Also, I thought of another device in canon in the context of your fic.  The [device](http://en.stargate-wiki.org/wiki/Stargate_destroyer) Anubis used to overcharge the gate... what if it was actually meant to drain the excess power buildup you described... but because it is so rarely used and there are so many stargate it can't actually drain power fast enough, so it was re-purposed into a tool for destroying stargates.

    Yeah, as far as I know this should all be 100% canon compatible. I mean a lot of it is just completely made up (e.g. literally everything about the Furlings), but I tried not to violate anything established. Most of it started from attempts to explain completely ridiculous canon behaviour and the fact that observed stargate physics makes no sense.

    I'd completely forgot about the anubis gate weapon. Your explanation for it sounds pretty plausible though.

      Huh, I almost thought you were trying to obliquely hint at it and was expecting it to be name-dropped or something towards the end.

      Well... if someone from several hundred years ago had access to modern technology with no instructions, a lot of it would seem counter intuitive and weird I bet.  But yeah, the stargates' and other tech's weird behavior doesn't make sense as a result of basic physics.  Using your style reasoning, I bet one could come up with a technological explanation though.

        Yeah, it could be that there actually *is* some clever advanced physics reason for a lot of the behaviour, but given the weird edge cases, the observably terrible safety and security design principles, and the in-series description, "strap a ring transporter onto a wormhole and sort the rest out in software" seemed like a pretty good explanation. :-)

  ```
  For Omela Desala's sake, you morons, learn to formally verify!
  ```

  - u/FeepingCreature:
    ```
    "What? Oh, no, yeah, that's in the spec. Page 17, 'Behavioral limits in high-energy environments'. Correct as written. Seriously, learn to RTFM?"
    ```

  - u/DRMacIver:
    ```
    If the ancients immediately know they need to formally verify, the galaxy was cooked a long time ago.

  Now [available on fanfiction.net](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11158355/1/Stargate-Physics-101), so if you liked it I'd appreciate a review. :-)

  ETA: Also [on AO3](http://archiveofourown.org/works/3673335) because my invite came through and fanfiction.net's interface made me cry.

    Fanfiction.net does a lot of things wrong, but at least you can do searches with exclusion criteria. Either AO3 lacks this, or I'm an oblivious pillock.

  This was awesome. What was Sam's reaction? What was the SGC's reaction to this info? The beginning had the main characters of the series for a very short time, and then it never went back to their POV. I imagine that knowing or having a good idea of all of the hazardous tech problems that can happen with the Stargate ahead of time would have a big impact on the plot of the series. Some episodes just wouldn't happen the same way since the SGC would be more prepared. They might even (eventually) be able to make their own stargates, or at least fix the current stargate system or take advantage of their knowledge of how it works to get an upper hand on the Goauld. Although this would make the Ori a lot scarier, admittedly.

    Yeah, they're mostly there for set up. I don't actually want to write main character Stargate fanfic because that would lead me inevitably to the unbounded time sink that is writing my Competent!SG1 AU and I already have an unbounded time sink of a project that is actually useful. :-)

    In terms of Sam's reaction, I'm not sure. She's going to have to rethink a lot of what she thought was fundamental physics. I think the main actually useful take home from this is the fact that giant space gates and extremely compact long range communicators are things that you could potentially reverse engineer from Stargate tech, because the things you think are fundamental physical limitations constraining how the gates work are actually just part of the project spec.

    I guess the other useful thing is knowing that you should be really a lot more cautious when doing irresponsible shit like dialling out to a black hole and dropping a gate into a star because basically these are only potentially non-catastrophic in the scenario that the gate designers were afraid of being eaten by a giant werewolf who was upset by them not handling that edge case.
