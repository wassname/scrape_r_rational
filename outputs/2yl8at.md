## [WIP] [BST] Find a loophole in this Unbreakable Vow

### Post:

I'm writing a time travel fic whose cast includes an older Harry Potter and a Tom Riddle who hasn't killed Myrtle yet. 

Harry has shared his pensieve memories of Tom Riddle in an attempt to show Tom that his current plans aren't going to work. Besides the fact that some teenage kids were able to find and dispose of his horcruxes, it seems that producing too many horcruxes can make you prone to poor decision-making. 

But none of that matters unless Harry can provide a better alternative. So Harry proposes a vow with the following points: 

 * Tom Riddle cannot kill anyone without Harry's approval. 

* In fact, Tom Riddle cannot take any actions at all with the intention of causing a person's death. He can't cast the curse himself, he can't tell someone else to do it, he can't even try to talk someone into suicide. 

* Harry has to set "help Tom find a means to immortality which doesn't involve killing people" as his number one priority. 

* If Harry has reason to think that his death is imminent, then he has to give permission to Tom to kill him. With this clause, Tom gets at least one horcrux, so he's no worse off than if he didn't take the Vow (again, the pensieve memories suggest that multiple horcruxes may not be worth what they cost)

For this story, I'm assuming that Tom's desire to live forever is greater than his desire to kill people as he pleases. Still, what loopholes or other problems do you see, which Tom might exploit?

  Step 1: Define a person using a measure such as sentience or sapience, etc.

  Step 2: Observe that a baby does not satisfy this definition.

  Step 3: Kill ALL the babies

    Okay. Okay. I had to applaud that IRL. 

    Only Tom Riddle would devise a plan whose *ultimate* step was "Kill ALL the babies."

  It seems like overkill. Why not just have Tom kill someone under circumstances under which it is ethical? He could impersonate someone administering lethal injection to someone as capital punishment, or if even that is too much of a grey area, he could euthanize someone who is on their deathbed and in agony.

  I really don't see what incentive Tom has to accept this vow. Harry already gave him all relevant knowledge of the future, and he can adjust his plans accordingly. Harry's own memories show that he is a terrible student, so his help isn't worth enough to throw away entire promising fields of research.

  If Harry is hiding more future knowledge as a bargaining chip, no worries, that's what Legilimency is for. If Tom isn't a Legilimens yet, a surprise *expelliarmus* and silencing charm will make it easy to have the basilisk petrify Harry until Tom learns.

  He can always accept the vow later, if it turns out to be a good idea. But I can't think of why it would.

  If Tom finds Harry to be a hindrance...then stupefy Harry, lock him up somewhere, and torture him until Harry gives permission. If possible, Obliviate Harry so he doesn't remember any of it.
  ```

  ```
  I will torture all of these people until you let me kill one. Oh. And maim them and obliviate all kinds of things...
  ```

  - u/Anakiri:
    ```
    He can't do that if he expects it to lead to that person's death. He *can* do it if he's experimenting with whether committing torture cracks the soul the same way committing murder does. It's a completely valid line of research!

    In fact, it's probably the simplest, most likely thing to work. It's what anyone would have to check if immortality without causing death was their number one priority.
    ```

      If torture works, then do you have to objectively be killing someone? Or can you be fooled into thinking that you're torturing someone (you're confunded, the other person is a simulacrum, &c) in order to get the same effect? 

      Of course, you probably wouldn't want a society of immortals who are all willing to torture people for immortality even if they hadn't actually tortured anyone. So it might be good for Tom, but Harry wouldn't like it. 

      It'd be fun if Tom came up with that line of research and Harry only found out about it somewhere down the line. 

      "WHAT DID YOU DO?" 

      "Well, I didn't *kill* anybody, for starters."

  Unless I'm missing something, this is not true. In a world with insta-death spells like Avada Kedavra, it's very easy to go from thinking that you're perfectly healthy and then dying, which means that Tom cannot make a Horcrux. Tom is then left unable to kill anyone, a severe limitation on his abilities, and lacks Harry's help finding immortality.

  Tom being unable to kill doesn't even just prevent him doing evil, it also limits his ability to effectively defend himself. And, depending on how the vow is interpreted, it may prevent him doing things like take a position of power or of responsibility in a hospital, where you are required to make decisions which will lead to deaths in order to reduce total deaths. 

  Besides, Harry clearly doesn't intend to die for a while. What if Tom is killed in the meantime? Securing his immortality seems an important priority, and waiting for Harry to near death is a massive risk. Alternately, Tom's Horcrux may be destroyed and he'll need a replacement.

  Is Tom being given an incentive to make this vow beyond Harry's help? Because this seems a massive curtailing of his abilities for little benefit otherwise

  Is Harry going to be an old and wise lorekeeper or a very smart version of himself?

  You need him to be at least one of those, or Tom has no reason to believe he will find an alternative means of immortality.

  Also, I would suggest that Tom might insist on changing

  > If Harry has reason to think that his death is imminent, then he has to give permission to Tom to kill him.

  to

  "If Harry fails to make Tom immortal by (arbitrary time-limit), or by the time they mutually estimate a greater than 1/3 probability that Harry will die soon then Tom gets to use him to make a horcrux."

  Otherwise the chance of Harry dying unexpectedly without a chance for horcruxing is too great for this to be in Tom's interests.

  I don't know if you're looking for canon-thumpy comments, but I don't think that Item 3 would actually work.

  What evidence we have on the subject (elaboration available upon request), as well as thematic consistency, suggests that it's not the *act of killing* that allows the horcrux to be created but the *magnitude of evil* that a murder is: evil acts damage the soul, and murder most foul is the only act evil enough to tear it so that a piece can be bound to an object. The upshot of this is would be that if the act of killing is not sufficiently evil (e.g., self-defense, mercy killing, accident), then the horcrux wouldn't take.

  This means that if Harry consents to be killed and will die soon anyway, is that evil enough to count? Considering that that's almost exactly what Snape did to Dumbledore, I don't think so.
