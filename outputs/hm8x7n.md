## [WtC] What's happening with Worth the Candle?

### Post:

It hasn't gotten an update in way longer than it usually goes, is it on hiatus? I see that the word count document suggests a roughly release sized amount written, is it coming out? I don't want to be annoying to the author, just worried lol.

  Writing is just going slowly. I've been stressed and anxious, and with that comes depression rearing its ugly head. There have been more than a few "zero days" in the last two months, where I'll sit down to write and nothing comes out. I think for the first part of lockdown, I was able to channel some of that stress in productive ways, but it's become harder as we've gone on, and stress-fueled writing isn't really sustainable (for me).

  I wish that I were writing something else, something that was happier and less complicated, less about hard choices and trauma and messy morality. The stuff going on in the United States right now just has me perpetually pissed off and worried, which hasn't really been helped by drastically cutting down my time on the internet and blocking certain sites where I would normally get my news or numbers. It would be nice to stick my head in the sand, but it's hard to do that, and I keep having to make choices about what an acceptable level of risk is for me and my family.

  As Dr. Seuss says, un-slumping yourself is not easily done, and I've found that to be doubly true when the source of the slump has stayed basically untouched. I'm sorry for anyone who's been waiting on tenterhooks, I just haven't been in a great place recently.

  (For reference, "par" is 1,000 words per day for me, and the counter is currently sitting at 682, which would probably be more dire if it was a seven day trailing average.)

  In case it's not obvious, I don't really want to talk about any of these issues with anyone here, just offering up an explanation, and will probably write something longer about how life has been going for me when the chapters get posted, just for context.

    That's perfectly fine and we completely support you no matter what you choose to do!

    > I wish that I were writing something else, something that was happier and less complicated, less about hard choices and trauma and messy morality. 

    Is there a reason why you can't do that? Wouldn't it help you if you could take a break from WtC to write something short that's less emotionally taxing for you? If you are worried about Patreon supporters, the impression I got is that most of them support your writing in general instead of just WtC.

    Just a suggestion for you to think about.

    Good luck!

        This was my first thought as well... but as I consider it, most of Awales writing is pretty harsh.  The Metropolitan Man?  Amazing, but I found it more devastating than WtC.

      Honestly I'd probably like something less heavy better then Worth the Candle, it gets to be almost too much for me fairly regularly.

          I wish I did. I’ve been considering on-and-off writing ratfic set in the *Kirby* universe, trying to keep to the same general tone and mood the games in that series are known for, despite the more aware/intellectual viewpoint. It’s actually quite a challenge!

    Please, I completely understand. You've given us a hell of a story, and in no way should you be sorry for not maintaining your normal output. I absolutely love WtC, and as long as it's not just dead I don't care if you take your time, and I'm sure that's true of all your readers. These are indeed tough times.

    Good to hear from you, as usual.

    > I wish that I were writing something else, something that was happier and less complicated, less about hard choices and trauma and messy morality.

    I might add that, if you did write that something else, I'd expect to enjoy it very much, and I would personally encourage you to write it if you felt like it. (Though I admit I'm not a particularly representative sample if you're worried about fanbase retention.)

    I've been a fan of /r/oots since 2003. I eagerly await every update. No serialized fiction that I'm aware of, with the possible exception of Game of Thrones, is comparably slow to OOTS. Any fans lost due to slowness are long gone, and his Patreon is half again the size of yours. Don't worry about it. (And on the subject of GoT, if HBO decides in its wisdom to make a WtC series before you've finished and catches up to you, that's a *good thing*.)

    You're doing fine. Take as long as you want to make a better story. You won't lose any worthwhile fans, and even the complainers will probably just catch up with the story every few months.

    Take care of yourself. I'm sure you already are, it's one of those social platitudes like "drive safe", but those platitudes are basically a way of communicating "I care what happens to you" so are worth doing anyway.

    On the subject of HBO/Netflix/Amazon etc series - here's a suggested side project if you'd like a distraction: pitch Shadows of the Limelight, possibly via an agent. It's coherent and comprehensible, has a *great* gimmick, and has potential for very very cool action sequences as well as thoughtful philosophical debate. "Game of Thrones crossed with The Boys!"

    Dark Wizard of Donkerk would be similarly adaptable to the screen although it'd be better as a movie than a miniseries IMO.

    Somebody else commented about Patreon supporters, speaking as a Patreon supporter it literally doesn't matter what you're writing. WtC is fantastic, but your writing style is really what gets me.  


    If WtC is hard to write and you want to throw some time into something happier/less complicated/more relaxing for you, you've got my support 1000% and I'm sure most if not all of your fans would agree with me.  


    Alternatively, if you need a break from writing in general, you still have my 1000% support. Your health and well-being is infinitely more important than something I get entertainment from. Take care of yourself, friend.

      Another Patreon supporter - everybody's on hard times right now, and mental health is more important than ever.  About a third of americans are anxious or depressed in these times\[1\]!  It sounds like you're in the early stages of burnout, and I'd really recommend avoiding going farther - who knows how long it will take for you to recover?!

      I'm not supporting a specific work (Worth the Candle), and I'm not supporting writing in general.  I'm supporting an author.  Take all the time you need to be well.

      In my opinion, you're the best author whos work I've had the pleasure of reading.

    As a patreon supporter and long time reader, please, take your time. 

    I wish there was more I could say to make you feel better, but I don't have the words. What I do have is this delightful link to a relevant blog post: 
    https://journal.neilgaiman.com/2009/05/entitlement-issues.html

    The relevant quote being:

    "George R.R. Martin is not your bitch.

    This is a useful thing to know, perhaps a useful thing to point out when you find yourself thinking that possibly George is, indeed, your bitch, and should be out there typing what you want to read right now.

    People are not machines. Writers and artists aren't machines."

    Be well, take care, we'll be here when you're ready.

      Okay but I mean, I disagree with Neil Gaiman even on the matter of GRRM¹, but it's a bit of a different relationship when you are running a Patreon. Not that it's an issue in this case since all the Patreon supporters here are being very supportive.

      ¹ Not that I literally think GRRM is the readers' literal bitch, but if we're down to arguing that Gaiman has already won the framing battle, etc etc

    I just created an account to thank you for all your work (fiction, podcast, redditing).

    Alexander, if you want to start writing something lighter on the side during this clusterfuck of a quarantine, I'm inclined to say no one would object. I certainly won't.

    Best wishes from a long time fan, regardless.

    As many have said, please write whatever helps you, and take your time, I'm here for the marathon of your writing, not just now.  I'd read flesh.txt, even though I'd expect it to be awful, and not to my tastes to see what you are writing.  I'm not sure if I'm dollar voting you but I wouldn't care if you gave several releases of asides to re-teaching Blood God Doris humanity playing Bunnies & Burrows to give yourself a lighter aside.

    I'm also a patreon supporter, and by all means do not feel pressured to maintain your output. It's perfectly understandable and you have our support whatever you choose to do.

  - u/AStartlingStatement:
    ```
    Just echoing what others here have already said, don't stress about pressure to release, take as long as you need. I finally started contributing to your patreon as well, I should have done it a long time ago because WtC is my current favorite, well, anything honestly.

    >I wish that I were writing something else, something that was happier and less complicated, less about hard choices and trauma and messy morality. 

    As a (very meager) patreon supporter, write something else for a bit? I'd very likely enjoy it.

    One thing I note about fanfic is that using established settings and characters lets you ignore a lot of the set up that books typically have to do, and jump right to the interesting parts of the stories.

    Also, there's plenty of room for interludes in the WtC world. It's a fascinating world with a *lot* of people. Surely some of them are doing interesting things that aren't morally ambiguous or depressing.

    Presuming you keep WtC as you main focus I think there's plenty of room for other stories to be told. If you didn't keep WtC as your main focus I'd be cool with that too, I think there's value in having a finished project but I'd be interested in exploring other themes.

    Fucking zero days man.  I just started writing a fiction and had a good bust of activity a month ago (500 words a day/ four days) and literally haven’t written anything since then.

    Good luck dude, you can do it!

    I am going through the exact same thing. My reading habits even changed too, stories I would otherwise enjoy for the complex morality and hard choices I have found hard to engage with, while I have found stupid simple power fantasies to be a lot more enjoyable lately.

    I didn't actually realize how bad it was until I read this. Your thoughts are an exact articulation of my own. I can definitely empathize, thank you for responding.

- u/LupoCani:
  ```
  Writing is a bit slower than usual. While the author has mentioned specific factors like being really stressed out by lockdown and protests, (not sure how much either of those apply at the moment in the area he lives) it's not really outside the normal variance for WtC, either in writing speed or batch delay, though it is on the slow/long end. The author continues to occasionally participate in casual conversation on the discord server, we have no indication that something in particular is amiss nor that an explicit hiatus would be in place.
