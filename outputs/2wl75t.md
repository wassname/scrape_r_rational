  It's chapters like this one that remind me why I love this fan-fic so much.

  > "I wore the mountain troll as a false tooth while Dumbledore was identifying me to the Hogwarts wards as the Defense Professor."

  I was sure this wouldn't happen, based on chapter 84: (the troll wasn't standing, and it seemed too likely to go wrong.  I mean, we've *seen* what happen when a mere rock reverts from transfiguration within a mouth...

  > The Headmaster drew a circle, and told Hogwarts that he who stood within was the Defense Professor.

  Ah well.  *This is the third of four 'I was wrong' forfeit comments I owe /u/alexanderwales for [this bet](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2wcyi5/harry_potter_and_the_methods_of_rationality/coppx78).*

    Hooray! :)

  ```
  Well.

  That...

  Well.

  I notice still that nothing has been said of souls.
  ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    Yeah, that is ... somewhat mystifying, since this is yet more evidence of something soul-like in the HPMORverse.

  What part of the story was Quirrel referencing when he [said](#s
  " "It is a catastrophe for any who oppose me, and you wrought it with one finger drawing wetness on a tea-saucer."")

  I can't remember that at all...
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Chapter 40

    >Harry set aside his teacup, then drew on his saucer the symbol he
    had seen on the inside of his cloak. And before Harry could take out
    his own wand to cast the Hover Charm, the saucer went floating obligingly
    across the table toward Professor Quirrell.

      Thanks, but after re-reading the relevent portion, I'm still confused about the consequences of that action. As far as I can tell, he [basically] (#s " told Quirrel that the ring he had was the resurrection stone"), but how did [that] (#s " free his "spirit to fly where it pleases and seduce the most opportune victim"")
      ```

      - u/blockbaven:
        ```
        [From the latest chapter, just before "frees my spirit"](#s "Thanks to you, I learned where to find the Resurrection Stone. The Resurrection Stone does not bring back the dead, of course; but it holds a more ancient magic than my own for projecting the seeming of a spirit. And since I am one who has defeated death, Cadmus's Hallow acknowledged me its master, and answered all my will. I have now incorporated it into my great creation." Professor Quirrell smiled slightly. ")
        ```

  That was awesome. Totally lived up to the hype this far. Finally some answers. Unless he still can bypass that truth thingy. Would be kinda shitty though.
  ```
