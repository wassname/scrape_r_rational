  Opt-out would be best, I think.

  I'm fine, how about having everyone upvote if they're OK with it, downvote if they're not, to limit spam?
  ```

  ```
  I think it being active by default with the option of opting out sounds fine.
  ```

- u/callmebrotherg:
  ```
  I'm cool with it. 

  Also, the Top Contributors listing seems to not be updating.
