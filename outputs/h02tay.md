  Let's try this again with the title edited correctly 8-)

  Flicker does the hardest thing for her.

  Getting close to the end of Princess - 1 or 2 more chapters.  Enjoy.

  For reasons I can't determine, I had an emotional block to reading the Princess. I noticed that and decided to "just try one chapter" 

  I've run out of lunch break, and plausible "correspondence with team" break but I haven't got to part 10. Sadness is my current state.

  I forgot how much I loved the characters in this world. Even if I want to shake my head at Flicker's emotional uselessness.

  Typos, or dialogue being weird?

  How you?

  Unless he(?) had a different name in this universe?
