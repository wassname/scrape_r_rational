## [TH] Transhumanist fable on r/WritingPrompts. “You’re the Grim Reaper, it’s your job to guide the dead into the afterlife to never be seen again. Today, you froze in place as the person you’re supposed to guide softly speak: Hello old friend, it’s been awhile.”

  Eh, it reads a bit too much like something from r/hfy for my tastes. The message is nice, but the writing doesn't really make for a very interesting story.

  It'd be interesting to read a sequel/alternate, where the Reaper reaps the last thing in the universe which could be considered "life", but is still surrounded by leftover constructs of civilization which are sapient or super-sapient in and of themselves.

  Would Death have to stick around until the universe itself ran out of energy, and thus the potential to accidentally recreate life, no matter how lowly? Or would he be able to hang up the cloak and scythe, put the chairs on the tables, and switch off the light as he left?

  I'm a stickler for the metaphor so I wonder what this would look like with the classical interpretation of the four horsemen: Conquest on White ("conquering, and to conquer"), Slaughter on Red ("that they should kill one another"), Famine on Black, and Death on the Pallid Horse. Probably Famine would be first to go?

  Eh, too pessimistic. I have hopes we will defeat Pestilence long before Earth is a cold, black cinder.

    They did, it's only a few thousand years since Rome in Death's conversation with Pestilence, not long enough for Earth to be forgotten. The final section happens further in the future. If anything it's optimistic, it assumes we'll last a very long time.

    I feel like you misread the story?  The part in which Earth is gone is set long into the indeterminate future.
