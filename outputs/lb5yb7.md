## Rational works of fiction about interspecies relationships

### Post:

So I know that there a lot of works of fiction that feature interspecies romance where members of two different species fall in love with each other. But one thing that I noticed is that most stories never explore the perils of an interspecies relationship. They never seem to take the time to explore how members of two different species are able to overcome their biological and psychological differences.

For example in Star Trek Vulcans go through a biological process called the pon farr, where they have to mate with another Vulcan otherwise they suffer from a violent nervous breakdown. Therefore the Vulcan government tries to encourage other Vulcans to mate with their own kind rather than with other species. However, Star Trek media has shown that a Vulcan can take up a non-Vulcan as their mate, but they never show how such a pairing is able to deal with biological issues like the pon farr and how such couples are able to meet each others emotional and physical needs.

That being said according to TV tropes there are a few works of fiction that explore how interspecies couples are able to meet each other's emotional needs and/or physical needs. Some examples include: Mass Effect (Tali/Shepard), Foreigner (Bren/Jago), Lost Girl (Bo/Lauren) and Gargoyles (Goliath/Elisa). There are also works of fiction that touches on the complications and perils that can arise from such relationships these include: Star Wars rogue squadron, and wraith squadron novels, the crystal star, Star Trek: Voyager: The Disease, Hyperdrive, and Mass Effect 2.

Does anyone else know of any other fictional media that explores the difficulties of an interspecies relationship and/or how said romantic partners are able to overcome these difficulties?

  There’s actually quite a lot of SF literature that addresses alien sex and romance from a rational perspective, from the frivolous in Harlan Ellison’s “How’s the Night Life on Cissalda” to stories where people damage their health trying to live with nonhumans with diverse biochemistry.

  Becky Chambers's "The Long Way To A Small Angry Planet" has a fantastically-done interspecies romance with very much the kinds of explorations you're looking for. Two of them, actually! And the book is just absolutely wonderful to boot, so definitely read it.

  Octavia Butler's [Dawn](https://www.amazon.com/Dawn-Xenogenesis-Trilogy-Book-1-ebook/dp/B008HALOEQ/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=octavia+butler+dawn&qid=1612314893&sr=8-1) fits the bill pretty well, though it's not purely a relationship story.

  edit: minor spoilers for story (nothing past chapter 2): >!it has an explanation for why the fuck an alien species would want to mate (or even be able to mate) with a different alien species, but isn't a deconstruction of the trope.!<

  I will also link [The Xenothesis podcast](https://www.xenothesis.com/) which is similar in format to We Want Worm, We Want MoR, and We Want MoR Superman but with Dawn instead of Worm, Methods of Rationality, or Metropolitan Man.

    I just looked up the premise and it sounds like the whole point of Dawn is how humanity learns to live alongside a bunch of imperialist alien rapists.

    If you don't mind I would prefer works of fiction where the romantic partners have a consenual relationship not a forced one.

      I'd argue it's a bit more nuanced than that, but fair enough.

  You might check out Axiom's End by Lindsey Ellis. The human and alien kinda end up in the relationship by accident and are now trying to navigate through it. Plus it's really smart and set in 90s nostalgia.

  As an older throwback, the Freedom trilogy by Anne McCaffrey does this, navigating the needs of a colony vs. the relationship vs. the distrust for the alien since he's part of the race that enslaved everyone.

  Interesting. For me the topic of interspecies relationships has always seemed off. Yea, okay, if all the alies look hot by human standards with big tits and dicks, but that's more like a racial thing, as 99% of aliens in SF are humanoid colored humans with minor cosmetic differences. But how many people do you see around shouting "damn, this goat is hot, would like to tap that" or "I hope to have babies with a shark"? That is interspecies for me.

  - u/the_terran:

    If goats and sharks could talk, people would definitely fuck them, even more than now.
    ```

    - u/ArgusTheCat:
      ```
      Can confirm.  Would fuck a shark if dating said shark.
      ```

  - u/RMcD94:
    ```
    People fuck everything, whether alive or not.

    A different thing from dating but still, not just primates too, all sorts of animals try anything

      Should zoophilia be normalized?
      ```

      - u/Roneitis:
        ```
        The capacity to consent is /everything/
        ```

      - u/RMcD94:
        ```
        So what no alien sex because it encourages zoophilia?

    Some people really do love people's personalitys compared to their bodies.

    Though that being said, I highly doubt an alien species would have similar enough psychology to fall in this category. This is the actual thing that would inhibit human x alien relationships, not looks

  "Bloodchild," by Octavia Butler, is arguably an interspecies romance (consensual parasitoid implantation rather than sexual intercourse, though). 

  If you like Homestuck, then I've got a stack of Weird Alien Biology / Psychology romance fics, too.

    Second for Homestuck, it was the first thing to come to mind on this topic. Although big disclaimer in it being a sprawling clusterfuck of a story that's hard to actually get into on account of both how dense it is, and how long the "introduction" segment is. Like it took me something like 3 or 4 attempts to push past enough of it to get to where it actually hits its stride when I read it the first time (followed by me spending weeks catching up to date with literal years of backlog). I'd make a joke here about prepping for a Homestuck read like a World of Warcraft player prepping for an expansion launch, cooked dishes ready, water bottles on hand, well rested, weekend stretching ahead of you, etc. But that would have a little bit of truth to it tbh

    Also, tangent, but the majority of other sci-fi and fantasy media focusing on only couples in interspecies relationships, rather than a huge range of other possible relationship structures, some of which humans already do in polyamorous relationships and the like, always struck me as underwhelming. Like I understand writing relationship structure alongside an interspecies relationship is an exponential increase in workload, but at the same time, why can't Mass Effect let me romance all of the hot aliens at once?

      I had the same issue. Eventually broke past it by watching [Let's Read Homestuck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jMzJaztnFs&list=PLHO1rc05qiGtAidSBy_8jsEOlHXR6x4cd), which has some phenomenal voice acting and, later on, some nice visual touches. 

      > why can't Mass Effect let me romance all of the hot aliens at once?

      Is mononormativity a word? Mononormativity. 

      Anyway, yeah, there needs to be more poly in our weird alien romance fics.

    Just looked up the premise on tv tropes and the amount of real consent that the main protagonist has looks pretty iffy. 

    While I do appreciate the time you took to show me this, I would appreciate it if you focused on stories where members of two different species see each other as equals rather than as a conquered or lesser race.

  A list of such stories, usually referred to as "pancakes" stories by the "Humanity Fuck Yeah!" subreddit (scifi where humans are exceptional, not galactic average). They tend to skew rationalist.

  Maybe "The madness season" By C.S. Freedman; it's very far from hard science.  And it might be argued as alien vampire relationships.    Downside a lot of the premises of the story are goddess of everything else views on evolution.
  Upside you have some clever resolutions to conflicts.  The evil empire is made of a species  >!of sapient man sized space ant colonies, only the colony and breeding royalty are sentient,  and consciously selects for evolutionary potential!< , >!that ganked the elder race's stuff!< !

  Edit: Someday I will get spoiler tags right on the first try: today is not that day,  jam tomorrow.
