## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding and Writing Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*
* Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is *also* the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  I've been trying to plot out a book with the WIP-probably-not-actual title "Isekai Everywhere", which posits a world where "summon protagonist from another world" is pretty damned cheap and getting used for a lot of things that are trivial, not quite approaching Meseeks level, but at least a little bit close.

  What I think interests me most is something like *World War Z*, where there are a bunch of stories linked together by a frame story, each of which touches on a different issue or theme, but which taken as a whole are an exploration of the world and its history, especially the moral/ethical issues with summoning someone from another world, the impacts to society, the winners and losers in the scenario, and the unexpected aspects.

  So ... for a long time, I've been wanting to write a fantasy travelogue, kind of a slice-of-life thing that involves visiting different places. The structure of it seems pretty obvious: you just have the protagonist learn and grow along the way through his experiences, all of which are fairly mild, you start at the beginning and end with him returning home having changed, maybe making a decision or two along the way. That's the natural shape of that kind of story, at least to me.

  But for a story composed of stories like Isekai Everywhere, I'm less confident that I know what it looks like from a structural perspective, even if each story is saying its own thing about something, or building on a meta theme. My natural instinct is that I'd start from a place of stability, have the stories set in unstable times with character/theme/plot links between them, and end with a different kind of stability when everything has settled into some kind of new normal. But I'm not sure about it, and I'm hesitant to do outlining for all the stories if they're going to be stops on the road and I don't know what the road is going to look like.

  Advice/thoughts would be appreciated.

    You could play with Magic the Gathering's idea of "Sparks."

    The difference is that, instead of being able to change planes on their own, these Sparks are people who are susceptible to being summoned.

    The result is that you've got a lot of summoners calling people, but they tend to draw from the same general pool of people. 

    So, your travelog can be the MC going from a newly awakened world-traveler, to an experienced old hand.  Or just talking to other Sparks in the bar where they all hang out between missions.

    A "same people, summoned many times" thing also explains why random summoning are better than just picking some guy off the street.  Sure, the first time a spark is summoned, they're just some guy.  But after the 1000th summon, they're probably pretty competent just by virtue of experience

  Golem world: Golems are an ancient technique that never saw very much use, because in order to animate one, you needed a soul which was not going to any afterlife. A hero too righteous to go to any of the hells, who had somehow offended the gods, a heretical philosopher, or certain kinds of mad(wo)men. For thousands of years, golems were the personal bodyguard slaves of the very rich or powerful, maintained with excruciating care and built to be nigh indestructible. 

  Then the Academy of Night breached the veil and started hovering up the souls of earths dead. With no True Religions, earth is trailed by a cloud of souls counting many billions. Most summoned by the academy of night are promptly judged and sent onto afterlives that are, uhm, very unexpected, to them, but quite a high faction is claimed by no gods.

   Hence the Golem Revolution.  The Academy of Night gets very rich and makes many high minded speeches about how their sales of golem power and cognition crystals is just funding their philanthropic endeavor to rescue alien souls from limbo. Also the silk sheets in the student dorms.

  MC keels over dead from a stroke at age 98 at a protest rally, and comes to in a student side project with some pretty obvious flaws in the control logic. 

  Does this sound like a story I should pour some time into fleshing out?

    It sounds like something I would enjoy reading, especially if the MC is using otherworldly knowledge gathered along such a long lifetime to further his goals.

    I'm assuming the MC would be going on a quest to patch the veil, once s/he learns what is happening? Or perhaps he becomes **The Golem God of Science** filling the vacancy in the pantheon of Gods so that the poor souls with No True Religion (such as he once was, as many from Earth are) have representation and judgement and can finally RIP?

  I'm working on a D&D setting for a campaign I'm planning. The basic premise is that it's set after a cult successfully triggered the apocalypse; the world has cracked into fragments and fallen into Hell. The remaining survivors are on fleets of magical airships (which conveniently happened to exist in large numbers already, because they were used for trading and war), using a variety of magics to prevent starvation.

  One of the setting-specific changes is that there's an easy to learn cantrip that produces a tiny amount of the magical fuel that is used by airships, so nearly anyone can convert their time into value at a (fairly low) base rate. All PCs are allowed to know this cantrip for free.

  Some fragments of the old world were caught in the apocalyptic storm that destroyed it, and those swirling fragments make up the new sky. Occasionally, a chunk of land will fall from the storm, slowly descending into Hell as the magic keeping it aloft fails and triggering a desperate expedition to scavenge resources from it.

  What interesting consequences might there be here? How might people organise themselves? What problems are likely to be an issue for ships and fleets, assuming they've got food mostly handled via divine or nature magic?

    ```
    How long ago did this cataclysm occur? Years? Centuries? Is it possible the cult/some of the cultists are still around? Was this a ritual gone horribly wrong, or horribly right? How much time was there for the evacuation to the skies, or did everyone on land when it happened just die? Is time travel a possibility in this world, and is fixing the planet a possible goal?
    ```

    ```
    So everyone's living in relatively close quarters to one another? Is there room to grow and have a family? Who owns the space people live in, or is there no class divide? Is there any kind of economy, or can everyone produce their own food and water? Do individual ships have unique resources? What hobbies can people engage in? Sports? Can one study and be a more productive member of society or is there no impetus in that direction? What impact does Hell have on their day-to-day lives? How are the suicide rates - is there a goal for making the world whole again or getting off the ships? Are there any surviving animals or pets? Mutated monsters or the like attacking the ships? Have people changed due to the altitude or die younger? If they have everything they need. What resources are they scaveging from the fallen chunks of land?
