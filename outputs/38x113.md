  I like the fundamental meditative questions he asks himself in order to generate his stories.

  * What is the nature of reality?
  * what are the innate qualities that make us human?

  I am a physician and I often ponder on the disconnect between how I perceive reality and an actively psychotic patient is interpreting the same reality through the added lenses of conflicting internal stimuli. Most people agree with my version, most of the time. Do I have some of these maya illusions draped over my version too, things I am equally blind to in how I apprehend and comprehend the world?

  His non-temporal interpretations of the coincidences between minor life events and his religious background do not seem to be explored in a similarly critical manner, though.

  Perhaps subconsciously he had heard the Book of Acts when he was younger and internalized it. Or, elements of the story are common enough that they would overlap.  Frankly, I'd be more impressed if his story matched something from the Bhagavad Gita or another tale he had much less liking of of ever hearing before, yet his book precisely pattern matched with it.

  I gotta hand it to PKD though, he writes some trippy lit.
