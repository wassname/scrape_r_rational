## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  ```
  I'm looking for rational works in which the protagonist tries to tackle systemic issues in a world, who navigates complex political situations, and/or wins through the use of his faction rather than personally hitting things. Things that I think would enhance such a story would be clever use of magic, meaningful character development, multiple competent agents, main character required to receiving meaningful help, a focus on allying with adversaries instead of only defeating them.

  Stories that I have read that tickles this fancy(not going into the flaws of the works):

  [With This Ring](https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-story-only.8961/)\[DC SI\]. The main character in various ways try to find mundane uses for DC magic/technology. Examples include >!introducing a magic school and let encourage armies to learn magic and asking a mad social scientist to figure out why i.e. a supervillain robs a bank with a freeze gun instead of finding commercial uses for it, introduces a magic school. !<I in particular enjoy that the main character tries to figure out what other people want and aligns their incentives to further his goals and really want more of that.

  [Two Year Emperor](https://www.dropbox.com/s/w6279gwfusrdcsx/The_Two_Year_Emperor.zip?dl=0)\[DnD Isekai\]. Guy is yanked into a DnD world, crowned emperor and fights Evil by i.e. >!making Wish traps to give everyone youth and major permanent buffs.!<

  [Significant Digits](http://www.anarchyishyperbole.com/p/significant-digits.html)\[HPMOR fanfic/cont.\] HJVP controls a large faction and attempts to create major societal changes.

  [Amelia](https://archiveofourown.org/works/3998737?view_full_work=true)\[Worm fanfic\]: Through clever use of power the protagonists achieves power and creates their own team from which they derive their power. There are reconstruction of societies from the ground up (mmmm yummy) and political navigation(i.e. >!countries contesting over extradimensional land!<) though I would have liked this to be a little more of the focus.

  [Enlightened Empire](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/20920/enlightened-empire/)\[Isekaiish\]: Protagonist uses modern world knowledge to accent in power and play empire building with the big guys. There is some incompetent adversaries but at least one competent one.

    Quasi related to this: can anyone remember the rationalist short story/poem that's about the demon/idea/whatever that makes social/systemic problems so hard to solve in the real world?

    -edit- Found it. It wasn't a short story, it was an essay(?). Anyways, it's worth a read:

    Definitely read [Twig](https://twigserial.wordpress.com/), if you haven't yet. Sylvester fits your recommendation to a tee(?).

    Like all of Wildbow's works, it's more rational-adjacent than outright rational, but it features most of what people here look for: consistent worldbuilding, munchkinry, people acting according to their goals and values.

    Twig takes place in an alt-History's 1920ies, where the Frankenstein experiments were picked up by the British Crown, letting them conquer the entire world via zombie armies and worse experiments. Sylvester is one such experiment; a kid who was given drugs and poisons from a young age to keep his brain malleable, letting him acquire any skill soon, but making long-term memory retention difficult. His skill set is usually tuned towards social manipulation. Since he's really weak, he could never win a fight on his own, and is thus paired with a group of other kid experiments called the Lambs. They are used as spies, assassins, and terrorists by the Crown. Twig is at its core a coming-of-age-story of these Lambs, and deals heavily with sociology, class, politics, war, and gaining independence from your parents.

      Note that as with other works that were translated from chinese, it suffers from really bad prose. The plot is kind of interesting, though, and fits your request well.

    ```
    [Gray Mage: The Alchemist](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/27784/gray-mage-the-alchemist) seems to be heading in that direction, though it's still kind of early days yet. It's a mix of crafting and scientific uplift so far, though there's been some hints of allying with locals to push for societal change.

    Also A Hero's War, which is at it's core about applying science to a fantasy world in a realistic way: [https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/2826/a-heros-war](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/2826/a-heros-war)

    On spacebattles is  [To the Victor, the Spoils](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/to-the-victor-the-spoils.270718/), about a famous supersoldier waking up decades into the future and being given a governorship/neofeudal duchy. The wider society which venerates her is generally awful and she's trying to figure out how to change things when most of what she has experience with is violence.

    Three  warnings - one, it updates only one a month (currently) and is fairly slow-paced. Two, the main character is a little Sueish - how much of this is justified by the "genetically engineered to be better" is debatable. Three, many readers (including me) disagree with the main character's and author's moral framing of both the historical and current conflict.

    >With This Ring—Author politics warning, src: https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/akek1j/rstff_whats_going_on_with_mr_zoat_with_this_ring/ef48paa/

    Edit: below text **is a quote** from Alexander Wales.

    ---

    There's a section of Sufficient Velocity rules (Rule 2) which prohibits misgendering. [Here:](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/the-rules-and-procedures-of-sufficient-velocity.40100/#post-8912695)

    > We expect, for example, that you will gender everyone appropriately. We expect that you will not refer to anyone by what might reasonably be considered a slur: don’t use “retard”, “japs”, or “traps”, for example.

    Zoat fell afoul of that (and claims that he didn't know it existed). As part of *With this Ring*, a character was turned from a man into a woman by some kind of magic, and was misgendered in the narration ... which might have been fine, but Zoat then said (non-story) that he defined people by what genitals and secondary sex characteristics they had. He also used the "sexually identify as an attack helicopter" meme. [You can read the staff response here.](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/posts/11965536/) Especially:

    > So how does this relate to 'attack helicopters' or 'trap'?

    > Put at its most bald, they're both deeply insulting ways to refer to transgender people.

    > The attack helicopter phrasing casts something very real and important as both trivial and absurd; the best case is that it is a mindless 'joke', a repetition of malicious mockery by someone who didn't realize that was what it is.

    > But even in that best case, it serves to drive out people who have done nothing wrong and who should expect and deserve to be treated with respect and dignity. And we don't want people being driven out, so it's covered by Rule 2.

    Zoat wasn't banned for this, he was suspended for a day. When he came back, he proceeded to do the exact same thing that got him suspended in the first place, which got him indefinitely suspended and the thread locked.

    **I would appreciate if people don't attempt to relitigate this here.**

      I'm not going to disclose my opinion on the ban or discuss it due to the request from Wales.

  [The Gods Are Bastards](https://tiraas.net/table-of-contents/) just finished book 15, and the author is taking a break for the rest of the month before he begins posting chapters for book 16. Per his end note, he anticipates two more books in the series before it's completed. 

  The webnovel has a somewhat-contentious presence in this sub, and I would identify it as "rational-adjacent." Motivations and goals are fairly clear for most characters, and learning and growing are key goals for the main cast. The worldbuilding is probably my favorite part besides the banter between characters, and there's a lot of politics, theology, and shifting alliances underpinning everything that happens. I've seen over time that many of the criticisms of the story are from those who read the first few books and dropped them, and a lot of those are addressed or explored later on. I also found that the characterization and writing improved over time as the author seemed to grow and develop as well. I can't guarantee it'll appeal to everyone in the sub - actually, I guarantee it WON'T appeal to everyone in this sub! - but I know it's the kind of story I've really enjoyed. And with 15 books (and basically another book of side stories) to get through and only two to go, it's not a bad time to get started!

    I really want to enjoy it, sort of hoping for it to scratch that Harry Potter itch, but it just drags like deadweight in many sections.

    It's epic in length but not in scope. It feels like a trilogy squeezed into 16 books with random tonal changes, whole sections that feel like the trade war part of the phantom menace and everytime something interesting happens, we rush through it and focus on some minutia. 

    I think the main groups are the most boring to focus on while the interlude type chapters are by far the best thing, but are used too scarcely and so the many side characters don't have much depth outside as foils or plot points. 

    When I started skipping whole chapters since i felt they'd be boring, I realised I couldn't keep going any longer. 

    I vastly prefer the wandering Inn, but it too has it's problems.
    ```

  - u/narfanator:
    ```
    Yep! I \_mostly\_ enjoy\_ it, although I've got a few issues. Seconding a few things: the world-building is on-point, characters really do develop, and not everyone here will like it.   


    Reliable update schedule, although I don't like it enough to read immediately on updates, I always get around to reading it eventually.

    I'm the opposite. The further the story got the more I disliked it; the thieves guild becoming a Mary Sue was the biggest issue for me.

  Gnomon by Nick Harkaway is not exactly rational but is certainly rationalist-adjacent. It's definitely inspired by ideas in *Godel, Escher, Bach* and *Inception*. The plot centres around a detective working a case in a future Britain mass surveillance state that has the capability of reading people's minds. It's the sort of book that I can tell after reading I will undoubtedly revisit and reread multiple times in the future. 

  The prose of the book is remarkably good, and it brings up a lot of interesting ideas. The book is extremely dense and has a lot of stuff going on, and I'm sure I'll get more of it on a future reread.

  I'd like recommendations for series heavy on "adventure" or "exploration" themes.

  I'm hoping for novels where a competent protagonist goes out, discovers a cool set piece (/exotic new planet), interacts with the locals, potentially overthrows a despotic king, and then continues on to the next adventure.

  I think there's a bunch of old-school science fiction that would fit, and a few modern authors.  I'd be happy for recommendations for either

    This sounds like TV serial format. Dr. Who, Star Trek...

    But it's not just TV. Older adventure serials may also fit; Edgar Rice Burroughs wrote plenty of stuff using this formula (Tarzan, Pellucidar, John Carter of Mars...)

    Or you could look up Alan Dean Foster's books (the Flinx series, perhaps, or Codgerspace). Or perhaps C.J. Cherryh's *Chanur* series is more up your alley, though that's a little more into interplanetary politics.

  [What's expected by us](https://www.nature.com/articles/436150a) by Ted Chiang is probably interesting and quite relevant for many of the people in /r/rational. 

  Why it's particularly relevant in spoiler tags:
  >!spoiler This story is particularly relevant because one major theme in a lot of rational fiction is the idea of a deadly idea. For example, CORDYCEPS and SCP stories in particular focus on that theme. However, in those stories the deadly "idea" or "meme" is usually unspecified or given a non realistic explanation. This story explores a more realistic deadly "idea" or "meme" and explains how and why society would collapse due to it. One particularly relevant quote: "People used to speculate about a thought that destroys the thinker, some unspeakable lovecraftian horror, or a Gödel sentence that crashes the human logical system"!<
  ```

  - u/IICVX:
    ```
    I never liked that story because it's really just a long version of the famous quote, >!"[We must believe in free will - we have no other choice](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Isaac_Bashevis_Singer)"!<
    ```

  - u/MrCogmor:
    ```
    I don't see the appeal of free will. Why would you want to make decisions at random for no reason at all? Behaving deterministically where your choices are determined by your circumstances and the kind of person you have grown to become is much more sensible.

- u/loveleis:
  ```
  Looking for stories that are rational (or rational-adjacent) that have some degree of romance/relationships in them. Not to be a central focus of the story. As an example, I liked how this was portrayed in Worth the Candle >!although the "Harem" trope in it is a bit weird, but justifiable given how meta WtC is.!<

  - u/nevinera:

    [The Fall of Doc Future](https://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/82363551272/fall-of-doc-future-contents) is perhaps \*too\* relationship-focused.

  Because I only *just* realized the sequels came out, I'm going to recommend Michael Grant's [GONE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gone_(novel_series\)) series. Reading the first book of the sequel series, I'm reminded of just how seriously these books take themselves, for all that they're YA literature. The characters are teens, but the themes are adult, and for a story that's essentially just one more take on "Lord of the Flies," it's still an interesting, fresh take that also neatly slots into the intelligent-use-of-well-defined-powers genre.

  Though, all of that is recommendation for the first series. I'm working through the first book in the next series, which is much more explicitly superhero v supervillain (in a way that's probably an interesting reflection about how marvel movies have influenced our culture in the interim between the great-recession influenced first series and the modern one, but that's a digression for another day). The writing quality and characterization is still excellent, not just for YA but in general (I re-read the opening to a chapter three times because it was so elegantly done), though I'm holding off on recommending it because I'm not sure yet if, having read worm (and this new series has some really suspicious similarities), reading the new series really adds anything.

  Also, I'm going to rec Alicorn's [Radiance](https://archiveofourown.org/works/1118999), the sequel to Luminosity. Obviously it's a common rec, but specifically I'm putting it out here as someone who read Luminosity, liked it but was depressed at the ending, tried reading Radiance, dropped it, and then picked it up again years after to speed-read the whole thing in threeish days. I don't know if it's me that's changed, or just that I had enough distance from Luminosity's ending, but it Radiance was significantly more readable this time around. So if you're in a similar position as I was, check it out.

  I've seen Zeta Gundam, and will probably watch Double Zeta after finishing Wing just to wrap up my knowledge of the Universal Century timeline.

  Are there Gundam mangas that are considered good in the scanlation? Most of my interaction with the fandom has been the various videos. I enjoyed 08th MS Team, 0083, Iron-Blooded Orphans, 0080, the recent Red Comet OVA, and G Gundam.

  Are there other "Mechs exist for a reason other than rule of cool" shows that are recommended? I found Star Driver, Promare, Gurren Lagann, and Gunbuster/Diebuster to be good, but never got into Gundam 00 or Gundam SEED.

  I am looking for a *"Government agency fighting aliens/supernatural threats"* stories. Inspiration came from the XCOM(2) game . XCOM is the local area 51 that firstly fights against aliens as they invade, and then guerilla war when they've taken over. The themes I enjoy the most:

  * how the XCOM researches aliens, and adapts their technology for their use.
  * the competency and working together as organization feel - most non-player characters are stereotypical specialists in their field - there is a gritty workaholic chief military officer, strict chief scientist and younger, more enthusiastic chief engineer.
  * going on missions - XCOM gains intelligence on aliens, finds what they are up to and then dispatches squad of soldiers to deal with it.

  Rational take on this scenario would be really interesting, but if you happen to know anything else that fits, please tell!).Some things that I've already found - **Laundry files** (but it's not too serious), **Hellboy** \- for the squad missions feel, **Rook** \- I think there is too much of mystery there. I am also thinking about [Fear the sky](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22171697-fear-the-sky#) and [Area 51](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/360929.Area_51).
