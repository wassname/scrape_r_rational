  So we finally found Sarah. I can't wait for the next few chapters wherein they hopefully compare notes with her and we learn about the original delves, before the memory loss. How long were they doing it to have compiled such a detailed map (the one in Sarah's old room) compared to what they managed in, what, ~2 months after James rediscovered the dungeon? What happened to the skills they must have gained in that time from orbs? Heck, where and to what effect did they use any greens the first go round? Looking forward to finally getting some answers.
