## "There is no particular reason for Ivo to tell Black Canary that he is saving the world, when you get right down to it, other than to set up the portrayal of an anti-death transhumanist as unhinged and evil."

  THIS.  This is why I always tell people I'm a mad, evil villain.  It's not lying, it's just phrasing things in terms they understand.  I want to save lives and improve quality of life via organized social cooperation; *ergo*, I must be a Stalin waiting to happen.  Everyone knows that anyone who makes a large change to the status quo in the process of helping people was not actually helping and is actually evil.

  *Everyone knows.*

    ... If you do it by violating people's individual rights,  you're evil.  

    Methods determine your mortality just as much as goals. If you force people to cooperate to make your new world,  then yeah,  you're not exactly a Beacon of morality.  And I really don't care whether a majority voted for your plan or not.

      To quote myself:

      >via organized social cooperation

      Or in other words, things like *elections* and *publicly-accountable institutions*, which are much, much eviller than lone heroes determining what's right for everyone, apparently.

      To be entirely serious, I do agree with the blogger that our culture has taken a really *bizarre* turn towards thinking that lone self-appointed ubermenschen are saviors of the human race rather than reactionary wannabe-dictators.  It's especially bizarre when men like, say, Elon Musk come out and *say* that they actually kinda *like* this whole "society" thing themselves.

      Go ahead and quote MoR!Quirrell at me, but do remember that Quirrell is presenting a view on society that is deliberately biased towards the negative, not only by the speaker's mind but by his intention that the listener should abandon society and draw closer to Quirrell.  Quirrell's IRL counterpart, Michael Vassar, has been described as expressing *nearly* that degree of cynicism but "with a phoenix on his shoulder".

      So yeah, the "ultra-Slytherin" view that we need ubermensch heroes to help us because we *cannot* help ourselves is just kinda... not really well-evidenced.

      >... If you do it by violating people's individual rights, you're evil. 

      Lastly, the term "individual rights" is *very* contested.  Not in the card-carryingly evil "No you don't have any rights" way, just in the way that some people believe they've got a right to anti-death serum and some people believe that they've got a right not to be taxed to provide others with anti-death serum.  You have to agree on what the individual/human rights *are* before you can use them as a moral argument.

        I think you are heavily misinterpreting my comments.  I don't think the uberman is the answer any more than electing an ubercouncil is the answer.

  Or, maybe,  Ivo is a meglomaniac and egotist with a messiah complex.  Which is exactly what he is in the comics.

  Is one of my favorite people on reddit linking to something written by one of my favorite people in general? Awesome!

  I'll inform the author of this article that we're discussing this here, because he tends to stay away from reddit.

  Frankly, the writing in the show is so bad that I can't imagine any individual or group could intentionally assert what this article criticizes.

  Of course half of the things these characters and villains do, don't make sense. Because the writers themselves are only trying to connect horribly contrived plot points together, not pushing some sexist, centrist, anti-transhumanist agenda. At the most, some biases, traditionalist ideas, and fears might peek through the crappy writing once in a while, but nothing near the level that is claimed.

  The article reaches way too far in trying to find hidden political agendas or meaning in simple bad writing.

  Not to say that there aren't people who might think that way, and fear/loathe transhumanist ideas. But they certainly aren't writing Arrow that way, or at least not on purpose.

    Without wanting to speak for the author, I think he might say that it doesn't matter whether it was intentional or not. 

    The anti-transhumanist sentiment is still there, and while generalizing from fictional evidence is a bad thing a lot of people do it. Even if it isn't intended, the anti-transhumanist (and sexist, etc.) theme is is still there and people are still watching and internalizing it.
    ```

      That is only one interpretation of why a character acts without reason. That doesn't mean everyone else is picking up on the same thing or even considers his motivations at all, since they don't make sense.

      It could be possible that the writers intended to portray something like how the article interprets things. Even if they didn't intend it, it still might be there as you say.

      And it also might be possible JK Rowling intended to spread satanism through Harry Potter. And even if she didn't intend it, it still might be there.

      But just because someone asserts an interpretation and a few others might see it as well, doesn't mean everyone else sees the same thing. To claim one interpretation is the only one others will see, is quite a stretch.
