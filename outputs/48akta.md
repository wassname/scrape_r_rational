## [D] Monday General Rationality Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics!  Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world?  Have you:

* Seen something interesting on /r/science?
* Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
* Figured out how to become immortal?
* Constructed artificial general intelligence?
* Read a neat nonfiction book?
* Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?

  Would anyone be interested in a Harry Potter RPG, with or without the serial numbers filed off? I have one more-or-less complete, but I need playtesters. (Also, anyone have any advice on playing pen-and-paper RPGs over the net?)

    This http://meetthenewboss.info/kent/hogwarts/Harry%20Potter%20RPG%20Core%20Rule%20Book.pdf may help.  I'd join but I'm already in a HP campaign (Set during Voldies first war) that's still looking for players.

    As for advice I'd recommend either Roll20 or Tabletop Simulator for the game depending on if you wanted to use macros or not. (Roll20s Macros take some getting used to.)

    If a neophyte may play, and it's focused more on role-playing and decision making than combat, then yes, very much so.

    I'm already a part of as many pen-and-paper games as I have time for, but I can offer some advice on how to play online.

    The first thing you need to do is figure out whether you're going to be playing synchronously or asynchronously.

    I've personally found that play-by-post or play-by-email has a tendency to fall apart, especially if you're doing a lot of combat. Where it excels is allowing for roleplaying and rich, deliberate descriptions. Where it fails is mostly in visualization (or if the people involved are bad at improv). Combat tends to be tough because if you've got four players and one DM, a full round takes a minimum of five posts. When you add in things like reactions, it takes even more. The big problem with this is that it can kill momentum and (sometimes) interest. To some extent this depends on the specifics of the system.

    Synchronous sessions *usually* mean voice chat, though I've done it over IRC as well. I currently use [roll20.net](http://www.roll20.net) with my group, which is free and serves the purpose of showing where walls and token are. The big problem for synchronous play is scheduling, especially since you have to schedule over and over everytime someone cancels, drops out, or a new person joins. (I also find that roll20 is a little worse for improv, partly because I'm trying to use good-looking maps and keep production values high, but that's a personal problem.)

  How realistically different do you feel created fantasy worlds need to be for you to read a story without getting torn out of the story due to the improbability of earthlike similarities? Even if a planet has a similar year it probably wouldn't have 7 day weeks or months with the same names as earth. Am I overthinking this when in actuality no one cares if the world has similar dating systems for convenience of writing or is this something I should make sure is unique to the world I'm building?
  ```

  - u/gabbalis:
    ```
    Humans. The fact that a universe with different laws has humans at all is a far, far larger leap than the leap of improbability from there to the world being like ours. I think most people are just biased towards humans seeming likely. When really once you've accepted that first leap all else ought to seem minor.
    ```

  - u/UltraRedSpectrum:
    ```
    It goes into the negatives for me. I hate it when people try to go way out into left field, because they almost always mess it up. Worlds stuck in ten thousand years of modern misconceptions about the Dark Ages, rampant misuse of glottal stops, stupid names, deserts where there shouldn't be deserts, space-filling empires, economies that don't make any sense, entire continents with *one language* - all classic examples of what happens when people try to make a world that's really "different" from Earth.
    ```

    - u/Bowbreaker:
      ```
      I'm curious how you would have to modify a pseudo-medieval world to realistically have only one language for a single continent. The only way I can think of is that it is the post-apocalyptic descendant of a modern empire and that communication technology has somehow survived (at least one magical telephone for each major village or something like that).
      ```

  - u/Farmerbob1:
    ```
    I struggled with this when writing Set In Stone.  I am fairly confident that I did not mention names of days, or even the number of days in weeks or months, though I did indicate that years were roughly the same length.  I felt backed into a corner.

    On the one side, the Nirvanans never lost their civilization, only their advanced technology, and they had a very strong education system to help them hold their institutional knowledge.

    On the other side, it had been nearly 5000 years since the AI took technology away and started the 'domestication' of humans.  I did take liberties with changed spellings of common names.

    I wanted a recognizable world, but I also needed a different world or it would be unbelievable.  Balancing act.

    In the end, I'd say this:

    If you do not need to reference background being different, don't.  Let the reader fill in the blanks that you do not NEED to have filled in for story purposes.
    ```

  - u/GaBeRockKing:
    ```
    If a world seems to similar to ours, I raise my eyebrows, get pulled out of SOD a bit, but will ultimately keep reading if I like the rest of the story. (For example, I'm a little weirded out by Log Horizon having hundreds of years of history, but barely any decay of the old pre-apocalyptic structures). IF the author tries to jam exposition down my throat for the purpose of showing off their work, I'll get bored and leave, though.
    ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    That's one of those things that I've always struggled with. On the one hand, you don't want to break immersion by including things that are obviously taken from Earth cultures. On the other hand, no one really cares about your system of dividing up the 122-day years or the system of measurement, and it's almost certainly not going to be part of the plot, so you don't want to waste everyone's time by including it.

    I generally do my best to talk around the cultural artifacts if I can and only include analogs if it can't be avoided or there's something compelling about the differences. If a culture is heavily into numerology you can give exposition on their divisions of time that way without *completely* boring people, for example.
    ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    If I might go off on a (related) tangent -- a personal pet peeve of mine is sports metaphors appearing in the speech of characters from imaginary words. 

    Example: Wizards X & Y are talking and X remarks that someone "hit a home run" with one of his spells. 

    !?!?

    Do they fucking have baseball in middle earth or wherever? 

    Sorry. This drives me up the wall. 

    Other examples: characters who live in fantasy worlds should not use expressions like "blindsided," "punted," "out of left field," "par for the course," etc etc. For me, at least, this completely breaks the immersion. You would be surprised how many fantasy writers break this rule.
    ```

    - u/DrunkenQuetzalcoatl:
      ```
      I generally agree but what is your problem with blindsided? I know almost nothing about sports and am from Europe so before your post I didn't know it could be about sports and still not know about which one. But does it have to be about sports? People including wizards have a limited field of vision and blindsided seems to imply getting impacted by something you didn't see coming. Either literally or something you weren't aware of.

      And while we are on the topic: What do you think about things like "at wand point"?
      ```

  - u/daydev:
    ```
    I've seen especially silly case with time units in one Russian fantasy (it was «Ветер и искры»/*Wind and Sparks* by Pekhov in case someone's interested in particulars) where author renamed hours, minutes, and seconds with made up words, but they were the same hours, minutes, and seconds, with the same arbitrary 60, 60, 24 divisions.

  As we head into Super Tuesday, I'm thinking how much nicer it would be if the political establishment were run by people who've heard of Fnargl and understand about rationally trading-off resources.

  As it is, they're showing that they're willing to invest arbitrarily large amounts of resources and effort *just* in putting a metaphorical boot to the face of anyone who would dare oppose them.  That's a *Lawful Stupid* Evil Overlord move.  A *smart* overlord *doesn't* make a big expensive show of how impossible it is to oppose them, they *buy off* the most legitimate and righteous-looking of their opponents for the comparatively cheap price of placating the masses' more egregious grievances.

  - u/Bowbreaker:
    ```
    Hmm. I'm missing the context here. What is this about?
    ```

    - u/lsparrish:
      ```
      Fnargl comes from a neoreactionary blogger's [thought experiment](https://unqualifiedreservations.wordpress.com/2007/05/20/the-magic-of-symmetric-sovereignty/) attempting to demonstrate that a despot with no threats to its power and a clear goal (obtaining the maximum amount of gold e.g.) would probably not oppress anyone (because oppression is too costly in terms of that goal). The reason a lot of us know about neoreaction is that Scott Alexander [wrote about it](http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/03/03/reactionary-philosophy-in-an-enormous-planet-sized-nutshell/) [a few times](http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/10/20/the-anti-reactionary-faq/).

  What do you value?


  Some possible reframings:

  * What do you want to improve about the world?

  * What makes life worth living for you?

  * What does an ideal life look like?

  * What about life is unsavory and worth eliminating?

  * What do you imagine life in a far future technological eutopia to be like?


  -----

  I've thought about this a lot lately, and I think I've come to the conclusion that I don't really care about EA -- or at least, typical EA goals. I mean, I do of course care about people and would prefer there wasn't extreme poverty and preventable death and all that. But, like, I just don't actually care about that more than other things, among which is trying to live and enjoy my own life. It's almost like I could spend those thousands of dollars much more, ahem, effectively.


  Of course for others, that could mean helping to eliminate extreme poverty asap. For me, I think that's something in the realm of exploring constructed worlds and immersive fiction, developing better technology to facilitate creation and experience of these things, etc. And then, life extention, because more of a good thing is always better. And x-risk, because you still need a society of creative individuals to create these things. Oh, and I think it's at least fleetingly possible we might accomplish biological immortality sometime in my lifetime, so I want civilization to stick around too. (That's more than a little bit narcissistic, but hey, I didn't choose to have these values.) Those aren't the only reasons and goals (obvious though, I would hope) -- just a broad outline of my thinking process.


  Of course, it's not like I don't care at all about typical EA concerns. It's just that I see extreme poverty and death from preventable diseases, and then I think about what's possible, and it's immediately clear to me that the difference between first and third world on that scale is basically a rounding error.


  Mostly I bring this up because in these circles, EA is rather central to the ingroup identity, and within that, EA-to-end-poverty is taken as a given. But I don't see much discussion about what people actually value, and how to effectively realize those values. As long as you have a term for other people (or at least your interactions with other people), I think "altruism" still applies and we can work towards our mutual interests.


  ...Or it could just be that I'm the borderline psychopathic outlier. *shrug*

    I think an important thing to consider here is how much impact one can expect to have in these fields.  My expectation is that really cool VR (for example) is going to happen because of markets, and that donating/funding such efforts would be low impact unless one has a lot of money (which could otherwise save a lot of lives; of course, funding such an effort would hopefully have returns which could later be used to save lives).  If one is thinking of doing direct work in one of the fields you mentioned, there is nothing stopping such a person from donating some fraction of their income to more typical EA causes.

    How do you expect to have a functioning utopia with sufficiently extreme inequality that people are still stuck living Third World lifestyles while others live (-3)-world lifestyles?

    >...Or it could just be that I'm the borderline psychopathic outlier.

    No, you're just not a utilitarian.  AFAICT, deep down, nobody actually *is* a utilitarian, and there's a lot wrong with utilitarianism, so I kinda just want to take all the philosophy people who've turned Displays of Utilitarianism into Displays of Virtue (ie: Peter Singer) and have them shot for crimes against humanity.

    But that's just me.

    I'm not sure that this is true. From my perspective, not everyone has to be altruistic. I would prefer however, that the people who *are* altruistic know about EA and that therefore the inherent charitable-ness of humanity were efficiently channelled. As such anyone who I interact with does not get negative points from me for not being an altruist, I simply view them as normal/baseline human. I certainly would not shun someone who accepted it as the efficient way to go about such things but simply had no interest in contributing themselves.

  If you had the ability to induce extreme pleasure in people- in other words, wireheading them at will- what would you do with it?
  ```

  - u/b_sen:
    ```
    Assuming that I could also un-wirehead them at will, recruit *informed volunteers* as research subjects for the following lines of inquiry:

    * How does this ability work? What does it tell us about human minds? (This is likely to suggest further lines of inquiry.)
    * Can this be used to encourage beneficial habit formation?
    * Can this be used to mitigate psychological drug dependence?

    Then follow the research trail.
    ```

  - u/Transfuturist:
    ```
    Me personally... I think I might sell it as a mood-improvement service, naturally going to the most wealthy. I would be concerned with safety and legality, and I would certainly not want to cause addiction if at all possible. Can I modulate the amount of pleasure, or is it a digital on/off braingasm? Can I modulate it with high-frequency pulses if it is digital, or is that just going against the spirit of the restriction? I see no reason to go into wirehead territory in particular if I can help it.

    My actual actions *(as always, seriously, this is my real answer to literally every magic power question)* would be to go to an effective charity such as GiveWell, tell them about my magic powers, and wait for the people who are smarter than me to tell me what to do where in exchange for a fair salary.

      The main problem with that is the Panacea Effect. If you ever read worm, Panacea is a superhero who has perfect biomancy, and she uses it to heal. Outside of battles, she spends most of her time at the hospitals, even giving up sleep. 

      She's been doing it for a while now, and by the beginning of the story, she despises it. 

      If you follow your plan, you may end up suicidal, or at the very least, with depression. Also, people are going to be pissed you're going to *that* hospital and not *this* one.
      ```

      - u/gabbalis:
        ```
        "You people all seem very angry that I'm not spending more time in hospitals. Fortunately, I have the perfect solution for that."

        \*Zaps them all and runs\*

        Similarly, Panacea probably would have been better off playing chaotic good and doing whatever she wanted. A Robin Hood healer of sorts ignoring all legal precedent and breaking into hospitals to go on healing sprees when she felt like it. She'd be a villain, but as long as she participated in endbringer fights... well. Nobody fucks with the white mage.

        Of course Panacea's personality, home life, and the bad PR Nilbog racked up threw a wrench in that in canon.
        ```

      - u/Epicrandom:
        ```
        That's because Panacea wasted her power to a frankly criminal degree.  Frankly, she had one of (if not the) best powers in Worm. With a bit of work, she could have custom-designed a plague that restores everyone it affects to perfect health.  Or turned everyone immortal.  Or gave everyone a better sense of smell than dogs.

        Instead, she fucks around in a single hospital.  It's like being given omniscience, and using it to be a really good dishwasher repairman.
        ```

        - u/None:
          ```
          To be fair, she was scared of becoming the next Nilbog, so she reined in her powers a lot. That's also why she spent most of her time at hospitals, so she could pretend to be "doing good".
          ```
