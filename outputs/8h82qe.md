## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  You've just discovered that, through some unknown process, your Maps app always knows *exactly* how long it will take you to reach your destination; if you get a flat tire on the way, that delay will have been factored in ahead of time.

  However, there's a catch. Since discovering this, its accuracy has decreased slightly. It seems that it looks into an alternate reality where you don't know about its supernatural accuracy as a defense against the simplest "park at a rest stop so your arrival time spells out the lottery numbers" attacks.

  Is there a way to exploit this system even with the aforementioned limitation?

    I work in road safety so my question is, what does it show if you die en route? Assuming it says "never", I'd use it as a way to protect myself from the thing that is the [third most likely to kill me at my age](https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/life-expectancy-death/deaths-in-australia/contents/leading-causes-of-death) (assuming I'm not pregnant, because apparently the #1 cause of death for pregnant people is *[murder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_pregnant_women)*!?), by which I mean, obsessively use it for every single trip and cancel the trip if it shows me being dead.

    (For people not wanting to click the link, leading cause of death for people age 25-44 is suicide, followed by accidental poisoning and then traffic collisions; heart and liver disease make up #s 4 and 5--if you're aged between 15-24 traffic accidents is your #2 cause of death) 

    I'm sure someone else has something much more munchkiny, but that was the first thing that came to my mind.

      Dying *en route* throws up a NaN error. That's some nice out-of-the-box thinking.

    Construct a private travel route lined with traffic lights (which you precommit to obey).  Have the traffic light controller cause the i-th light to stay red for 2^i minutes (or whatever the min resolution is) to encode some data as a binary sequence.  For example, have the traffic light controller encode the current value of the NASDAQ index.  Now your map app can give you that value at different times in the future.  Your ignorant self need only drive the route and obey traffic lights.

  Your Power is flight (Think Superman, or the Martian Manhunter or Wonder Woman or any Lantern). You can fly lets say 50kmh. You can lift lets say 200kg additional stuff. Everything more will force you down. More weight means faster down. You have limited invulnerability towards damage from falling or flying into stuff.

  Your flightpower doesn't make you produce an opposite force. You can lift a closed container, while you are inside. You can fly on other planets and in space (but is hard to tell there, you still can change your speed only up to 50kmh.) And you can leave the planet with your own flight. (and an oxygen tank)


  So how would you use that power? And how would you use it to fight?


  Btw you live in a universe, with somewhat similar physical laws. (No faster than light Superman or Flash, no spontanious mass change) But there are other people with powers. If you saw it in a Comic it probably exists there in a weaker form. (Like near invulnerability, laser eyes/hands, regeneration that needs energy and mass, ) And normal humans are a little bit more resilent

    Highest value activities are probably lifting mass to low Earth orbit, satellite repair, orbital construction.  

    Best attack is probably ...

    https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_bombardment

    From orbit, although you'll probably be a glorified ammo reloader of a satellite equipped with good optics for accuracy.
    ```

    - u/everything-narrative:
      ```
      Orbit is very far away, not just in altitude, but in delta-V. LEO is 160 km up, and 28 000 km/h sideways.
      ```

    ```
    50 kilometres an hour relative to what? If you start flying in a train, what happens? If the speed is then relative to the train, you could accelerate a spaceship by flinging 200kg weights against its front.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      Hmm true you should be able to do that. Nice exploit.


      And yeah relative to your previous speed and velocity, so relative to the moving train/spaceship. 

      Still would advice against throwing 200kg with 50kmh into a thing that keeps you alive (spaceship). Maybe with a custom made spaceship that could be possible. If I think about it, without/with less gravity opposing the flyer, he should be able to push the spaceship faster from the inside and than get pushed by the spaceship faster -_- not what I wanted
      ```
