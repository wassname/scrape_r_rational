## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  I've been playing Subnautica lately and really liking it. I'd like more like it, specifically:

  * A go out into danger, come back to a warm comforting base loop
  * Pretty visuals
  * A gradual tech progression
  * A definite end
  * Relatively short

  I played Minecraft *way* back before it had all the junk it has now, which is one of the only survival style games that I've played (and it would fail on both the pretty visuals and definite end front, though I've heard there was some kind of dragon added, so maybe the 'end game' thing isn't true anymore, or there are mods to change it).

  Depending on how you define it, Factorio might also qualify ... but I've already beaten it a few times, then beat it with Bob's Mods, then beat it with Bob's/Angel's, so that's well-worn ground.

    There's [Sunless Skies](https://www.failbettergames.com/sunless-skies/). It's the sequel to Sunless Seas, which is a top-down gothic/lovecraftian horror shipping game. You go out to sea with food and oil and try to make money exploring new islands and trading stuff, while not ending adrift or having to resort to cannibalism. Unfortunately, it had a fair bit of problems (trading isn't very good and it's really hard to not die and lose all your progress, even in the late-game and on non-permadeath mode, it's very slow, etc). It's also gorgeous and has a great setting. Sunless Skies is the sequel, where you're in a train in space instead, and reviews are saying it's a better game overall. Maybe you'll enjoy it.
    ```

    - u/alexanderwales:
      ```
      I'll check it out. I *have* played Sunless Seas, which I liked a lot, though I liked the narrative/writing part of it a lot more than the gameplay part of it.
      ```

      - u/sickening_sprawl:
        ```
        Same. I played Sunless Seas a bit, but just the shear travel time and busywork of not dying constantly detracted from enjoying the setting. I might just end up making a "peaceful mode" hack one of these days so I can wander around and read the setting.
        ```

      > top-down gothic/lovecraftian horror shipping

      This was not the form of "shipping" I have come to expect on the Internet, and sounds thematically wonderful. Maybe you can't romance eldritch horrors but still!

        I can guarantee that there are Lovecraft visual novel waifu simulators made. Unfortunately, I don't know of any...

    - u/None:
      ```
      I lliked sunless seas but found it almost unbearably slow. (Long journeys across the sea between ports are very atmospheric at first, but get tiresome quickly). Does skies fix that?
      ```

      - u/sickening_sprawl:
        ```
        I don't actually have it, but I assume not. There was a config option in Sunless Seas that let you run the game at 2x speed I used, but even with that it's pretty much by design a slow game.
        ```

  - u/ketura:
    ```
    The "go out into danger" thing basically describes any survival game--most of them in my experience don't have you be a perpetual hobo, but involve making a safe space with shelter, resources, and the like to retreat to between dangerous resource-gathering runs. 

    Have you given Terraria a shot? Presumably if you eliminated minecraft as "not pretty" you're not down for the 16 bit aesthetic (tho it has atmosphere in spades, so it might balance out). Unlike minecraft it has excellent progression and a clear path to follow through several bosses, with the final boss being a pretty solid end point. If I had to guess it's probably 20-60 hours end to end, totally depending on how sidetracked you get building your base up (and how cautious you are before crossing each metaphorical threshold).
    ```

    - u/alexanderwales:
      ```
      Oh, I played a ton of Minecraft back when it was a young, fresh game, the graphics thing is really more because I feel like there are a ton of Minecraft-esque games out now, enough that I can be a bit picky about what I play so that it's not all left to my imagination. I played Terraria back in 2011 and didn't have as much content as it apparently does now (a perpetual problem for me, because I'm not patient about games). I'll add it to my list to revisit (and maybe mod).
      ```

      - u/Imperialgecko:
        ```
        Terraria has added a lot of content, and the loop of going out and fighting then coming back to your base is there. I'm not sure I'd consider it a survival game but it's very fun
        ```

  - u/RetardedWabbit:
    ```
    I'd recommend Darkest Dungeon.

    Dark dungeons, bright base -The risk and reward loop to build your base and squads is good, although I wouldn't call the base warm or comforting! Losing heros you are invested in can be brutal, which will either make you really feel the danger or feel very frustrated.

    Style - The visual style is striking to say the least, with the different zones having great enemy art that matches their zone. I personally love the attack animations style. The narrator is also great in my opinion, but that's very much personal taste.

    Tech progression - Armor, weapon, and skill upgrades for every class. Upgradeable base buildings and equiping your heros with better trinkets over time. The base buildings and trinkets are my personal favorite improvements over time, since they offer real choices vs flat improvements.

    Definite end - Yes...but it honestly might not be worthwhile to reach. I find reaching it very hard to balance with having a high enough difficulty throughout the rest of the game, which turns the final stretch into a grind for me. I also tend to enjoy the beginning challenges of games more so than endings though, with hundreds of hours in Factorio but no rocket ever built for example, so take that with a grain of salt.

    Relatively short - Vastly depends on your playstyle, how you choose to learn, and your settings. I hate to be cliche but it can be long in the same way Dark Souls can be seen as a long game.

    Bonuses:
    Setting: if you enjoyed some of the grim darker parts of Sunless Sea you should enjoy the settings feeling of being a torch flame blowing in the night, keeping the dark at bay and precariously pushing it back while knowing you can lose it if you get too complacent.

    The biggest downside is the RNG, you can and will get slapped down by strings of bad luck. Most cases aren't truly unavoidable if you're honest with yourself, but it does happen and feels pretty bad when it does.

    Disclaimer: I haven't played the expansions, which seem to significantly increase base management importance and offer lower risk side missions.

    Subnautica is good. If you've finished the game, I would watch [Joseph Anderson's review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLsPoJWO-e8) for a look into some of its flaws, and also [Three Games to Refund No Man's Sky For](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGSa3UbxWo) for some similar recommendations (Subnautica is one of the things recommended in the video). EDIT: No Man's Sky itself has come somewhat close to this. It's not the game it promised at launch yet, but it's really close.

    If you last played Minecraft *before* the dragon, you're missing out on some pretty good content. See [this chart](https://i.redd.it/fz2lgt15czc21.png), looking specifically at the major features added after 1.0. It's still a pretty relaxed, easy game, and killing the Dragon is only a soft-ending, but there is a bit more content in-between to see. EDIT: Just saw the graphics stipulation. As always, the solution is [MODS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tgevDloTac) (haven't watched that video, just the first I found off of Youtube).

    RimWorld has a similar end-goal to Subnautica, but it's basically Dwarf Fortress lite, complete with worrying amounts of cannibalism, pain, and death, so I don't think it fits with what you're talking about.

    On the other hand, Fallout 4 with proper survival mods is pretty much like this, complete with the base-building mechanics. I haven't played much of any of the Fallouts, but from my experience with modded Skyrim, I know that the simple act of forcing your character to *eat* goes a long way.
    ```

    - u/alexanderwales:
      ```
      I actually do think that I might make a return to Minecraft. Based on that chart, I think I played the bulk of my time in 2010, prior to Alpha 1.2, and obviously mods can really extend the life of the game.

      (I'm still going through Subnautica (at a rate of about an hour a night), but the end is in sight.)

    Ha! Me too! I've owned SN for years but never could get into it (I kept trying to play it in VR and the controls did not work at all). Finally booted it on a flatscreen and a week later I'm 20+ hours in and totally engrossed.

    I should add some recommendations here:

    * "The Void" by ice pick lodge- a nightmarish exploration of an afterlife. Devastatingly weird/creepy. Also check out "Pathologic" by the same studio. Some of the most bleak but simultaneously *interesting* games I've ever played.

    * "The Long Dark" - frozen wilderness survival

    * "Astroneers"- a very cute planetary survival game with some of the same themes as Subnautica, but (last I played anyway) missing out on the engrossing story.
    ```

  - u/SlightlyInsaneMind:
    ```
    "Frostpunk" ideally fit your request.

    Also recommend to check out "They are Billions", although main game loop quite different but the feelings you described are similar to game experience

  I've just read the latest chapter of Lizard Person posted here and now I'm craving more stories about telepathy.

  Telepathy is a bit of a broad and vague request. So to specify, I'm asking for stories where the ability to enter another person's mind is a major aspect of the story and I'm very interested in stories where a character spends time in another person's mind (like a mindscape from *Naruto*).

  [Heresy](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6680379/1/Heresy) \- Something goes wrong with Naruto's Kage Bushin, and Sakura and Ino need to enter his mind to help him wake up.

  [Patternist Series](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008HALOVO/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_hsch_vapi_tkin_p1_i3) \- Doro is a manipulative immortal who lives by stealing the bodies of others. He uses his immortality to breed a race of telepaths and this is the story of an Earth ruled by a master caste of telepaths.

  Thanks to /u/Makin- for recommending [Conference Call]( https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/conference-call-multi-cross-worm-naruto-homestuck-mother-of-learning.682117/), the Mother of Learning/Worm/Homestuck/Naruto crossover fic here a few weeks ago. The characterization is really spot on (their roxy is great) , I highly recommend it. 
  Also darn you, it made me remember my love for homestuck dialogue and snark after being off the hussie train since the 1st gigapause. So, uh, if any one’s got any other hs fics where I can get that fix let me know. I’ve already read [Rain of Frogs & Collision]( https://archiveofourown.org/users/DaneelsSoul/pseuds/DaneelsSoul) and have been sucked into the hole of playing Hiveswap. God damn it. 

  Also, for an actual book recommendation, I’ve been rereading one of my favorite short story collections, Burning Chrome by William Gibson. It has a lot of really nice cyberpunk vignettes. Barring silly ones like Johnny Mnemonic, the ones like Fragments of a Hologram Rose throw in a lot of great background world building
  ```

  - u/sickening_sprawl:
    ```
    It's not an HS fic, but [What Football Will Look Like in the Future](https://www.sbnation.com/a/17776-football) is good (and in /r/rational's wheelhouse) and it's been described as "homestuck-esque" more than a few times.
    ```

  - u/rationalidurr:
    ```
    Ditto on Conference Call rec, am reading it now eagerly awaiting new chapter, no clue about HS and its lore, but wiki helps and its only 1/4 of story verse anyway. 

    Only downside, they are using MoL from start of story and I would prefer a bit later maybe even mid story Zorian.
    Still good tho.

    * [Detective Pony](http://detective-pony.tumblr.com/tagged/page/chrono) A full length version of Drik's gift to Jane
    * [Theater of Coolty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIavjRkRKT0) “Dirkencrantz And Gildensdirk And Two Other Dirks Are Dead”
    * [The Vienna Game](https://archiveofourown.org/works/472520/chapters/817654) Haven't read this, but it's a homestuck/neuromancer crossover that comes highly recommended.
    * [Act Omega](https://mspfa.com/?s=16414&p=1) The best fan-epilogue out there.
    * [Jojostuck](https://mspfa.com/?s=13714&p=1) Jojo part 3, expect actually good, and everyone is a homestuck character
    ```

    - u/Makin-:
      ```
      Vienna Game is just Neuromancer rewritten with Homestuck characters, and Act Omega has been stuck in the same arc for what feels like three years now, no plot progress whatsoever. If you're looking for an epilogue something like [Mr. Tambourine Man](http://odditycollector.com/mtm/) or even [cool and new web comic](https://mspfa.com/?s=14113) might be better, though extremely more lighthearted.

      The other stuff you recommended is good shit, though.

      may i recommend another good fanfic, [roxy's threesome addiction](https://archiveofourown.org/works/7190969?view_full_work=true)? its an absolute laugh riot with quality character writing.

      also as makin said, Mr. Tambourine Man needs more love
      ```

  - u/Makin-:
    ```
    Well, you're screwed if you want good plot-based Homestuck fics. The well written ones are 99.9% romance based, and you already named the only ones I'd consider rational. You might enjoy [Modern Cannibals](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12446468/1/Modern-Cannibals), which is not quite a Homestuck fic, but Homestuck-themed, if that makes sense.

  [CW: suicide, medical descriptions, poop, sex, strong denigration of people with disabilities]

  So, about 5 years ago I read this suicide note (really, it's a novella - very long). It was written by a guy who became paraplegic after a motorcycle crash, and did not want to live anymore in that condition. 

  I found it very interesting. I'm not quite sure if it counts as rational literature (it's not fiction - there's news articles and obituaries about the author), but I'd be interested to read other people here's take on it. I found it very confronting and visceral, but also... a bit illogical at times.

  He talks a lot about philosophy and the realities of being paraplegic. I recommend it, as long as the subject matter isn't likely to affect you negatively.

  http://www.2arms1head.com/

  in particular, when he talked about >!not being depressed, just not liking his life which he said was objectively terrible, and therefore not wanting to take antidepressants because that would effectively "kill him" and replace him with a doppelganger who was not him, because he would *never* be happy living paraplegic. I didn't agree with that logic, because if he was going to literally kill himself with a knife *anyway*, philosophically killing himself and replacing himself with another person happy with his lot in life would spare his family and friends grief !< But what do I know, I didn't live his life?

  Does anyone have any good Fate Stay Night/Typemoon/Nasuverse fanfics? Any that someone from this sub might not hate would be good; it doesn't need to be stellar.

  In particular, it would be amazing to see a fic with any detail in the magecraft of the Nasuverse, which I find incredibly fascinating.

  It's mostly awful trying to find fics on eg. FFnet, when most fics either butcher the magecraft, or rely heavily on the fanservicey aspect of the Nasuverse.

  Really, anything not terrible would be great.

    [Maybe I'm A Lion](http://forums.nrvnqsr.com/showthread.php/1870-Maybe-I-m-a-Lion-%28KnK-Prototype-Crossover%29) is a Kara No Kyoukai (The Garden of Sinners) crossover with Prototype (the videogame). It's really, really good but is almost certainly dead & permanently incomplete.
    ```

    - u/AurelianoTampa:
      ```
      Going to second this recommendation and also the warning associated with it. I had no idea what Prototype was going into it, and only a bit of experience with KnK, but it was really gripping (especially the titular "Lion" character's mental process, as he's crazy). But it ends suddenly and right before a majorly anticipated confrontation, which was incredibly jarring and disappointing.
      ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Contrary to /u/Escapement's recommendation, I never could get into Maybe I'm A Lion. Not familiar enough with Prototype for it to be good. On the other hand, there are a few gems that I've found, mostly crossovers.

    [Fate/Reach Out](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/fate-reach-out-f-sn-smt-p4-crossover-story-thread.245101/) is a crossover with Persona 4. It's good to you even if you don't know the Persona 4 characters, but the Fate portion of the crossover has only really just become relevant, and it updates slowly. Magecraft is less relevant compared to the Persona stuff, but it's still there.

    [Thaumaturgic Awakening](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/thaumaturgic-awakening-worm-fsn.378247/) is much better in that regard, and it has a regular (monthly) update schedule. That the author just broke, by two months, but, eh, you take what you can get with fanfiction. Unlike Fate/Reach Out, it requires knowledge of *Worm*. But if you haven't read Worm, I'll take the time to recommend it to you here in the recommendation thread anyway. In *Thaumaturgic Awakening*, Rin, Saber, and Shirou are in a poly relationship. This isn't too relevant to the story, but it might cause you to dismiss it for fanservice.

    That's pretty much it. There's a *Harry Potter* crossover I know is pretty good about this, that involves the gang going to Hogwarts and mixing the magic traditions together, but I forgot the name, and also all of the characters are in a poly relationship with each other. Again, because something about Fate/Stay Night seems to provoke that. It's not super long, IIRC, and *very* dead.
    ```

  - u/sickening_sprawl:
    ```
    [Fate/Hollow Fake](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/fate-hollow-fake.12936/) is *extremely* good. It's a finished (and very long) quest of an alternate universe with superb characterization and storyline. The author is currently running a Fate/Grand Order quest too that I've heard good things about, but haven't read myself.

    [Fate - Stay - Write - Go!](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/fate-stay-write-go-fate-stay-night-au-si.19663/) is an AU where the author is inserted as the brother of Shirou and inherits Accel magic. It's Shadenight if that means anything to you, which means its 1) pretty good 2) chunni grimderp 3) munchkining. Later chapters are pretty "magecraft heavy".

    [A Wandering Swordsman](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/a-wandering-swordsman-fate-au.51803/) is much more light-hearted, but also entertaining quest centered on Musashi wandering her way into a Grail War. Currently running.

    [Fate/Grand Quest](https://fiction.live/stories/Fate-Grand-Quest/WSqYHFxdbasEpMKH5) is a long (nsfw) quest running on fiction.live. It's pretty good and gives even non-waifu servants characterization, although devolves into porn occasionally.

    [Fate/Walpurgis Night](https://fiction.live/stories/Fate-Walpurgis-Night/mTcaddsMPg66nnS5S) is a finished (nsfw) quest on fiction.live following a Master in a Grail War. It's ok, although has quite a bit of fanservice/porn.

    Other than that, I can't really recommend any Nasuverse fiction. There isn't a lot, and most if it is *real* bad. I can't think of anything that goes into magecraft much, but that's mostly because Nasuverse magecraft is very much *not* rational or self-consistent. I see a lot of people try to argue Servant powerlevels or magical laws because Nasu puts out Word of God posts and Servants have grades for skills and mechanic-ish NPs, but it's pretty fundamentally shounen - all those rules are just there for framework and so the main character looks cool when he breaks them.

    EDIT: Actually, I wrote [Isolation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S0YdkCbc-Pu7DvYxpCQt0YHFJGbhneR1CffXbapq47M/edit?usp=sharing) (1339 words) a few months ago for one of the writing prompts because I was thinking about how sentient world-entities is the only sane way to handle non-self-consistent magic systems.

    Ditto on anti rec for Maybe I'm A Lion.

    The story reads like typical shounen manga with OP protag who gets powers and boost when needed, in contrast to the antagonist group Blackwatch who not only have and use tactics and training to track, guide and capture the protag but also rely on overwhelming force combined with science gadgets to counter protag's regeneration, and despite that protag still wins.

    Even when they drop a specialized thermite payload on him he still regenerates because magic thinks Lions are super special awesome kings, even though basic zoology tells us they sleep, rest and conserve energy and mostly hunt outcasts and weak members of prey packs.

    Make no mistake, Blackwatch is the anti zombie squad, comparable to a low grade SCP team, they can and will resort to drastic measure just to prevent an infestation and save humanity as whole, if Prototype game is anything to go by they are basically a fascistic branch of military ready to kill civilians and drops nukes on entire Manhattan. 

    And yet I was still rooting for them to win, because they have actual goals and try to win in ways you could reasonably expect to work, which don't because of author decision. They are bad people but they should have won in the end. I stopped reading somewhere after the thermite drop failed, maybe it got better though.

    > **What is glowfic?**  

    > The short answer is that glowfic is a genre of play-by-post text roleplay mostly characterized by its historical origins. It borrows certain tropes and quirks from a parent RP tradition (that usually took place on LiveJournal or DreamWidth) and the rationalfic genre (warning: TV Tropes link). Some of its defining/idiosyncratic features are, among other things: authors decided in advance (as opposed to anyone being allowed to join any threads), alternate universe versions of characters (original or not), heavy exploitation of magic, resourcefulness, ambition and hubris, suffering, and lots and lots of crossovers. Also so much shipping of everyone with everyone else, it’s amazing.

    I haven't read any glowfics but 2nd hand info tells me they are twilight fanfic named after different light/light effects. In some of them the main character interacts with the main character of other glowfics in some sort of metaphysical/metanarrative/meta-something way.
