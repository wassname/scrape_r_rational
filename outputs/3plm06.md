  Interesting premise. Is it going to be continued?

    No. I mostly posted this is lieu of posting a brainstorming thread, but this is about as far as I want to take the idea. If it kept going, it would follow one of the men suckered into having the curse placed on him as he engages in wetwork for the British government. Like a more violent James Bond but in the 1700s, with all his gadgets replaced by supernatural items, and unable to have his thirst slaked by any number of martinis. If I read the curse right, also incapable of having sex.

    If that tickles me enough I'll write it, but I think the premise is more interesting than the execution would be.

      The real problem would be fulfilling Yudkowsky's Law. If you've given James Bond the lightsaber of immortality and invulnerability, what is the Death Star that you give to Blofeld?

      Actually, it could end up being something like the Laundry Files, where the bad guys are mostly Lovecraftian horrors.

        Cthulhu Rae Jepsen's corollary to Yudkowsky's First Law is that you don't need to give Sauron a Death Star if Frodo's lightsaber comes with a dose of crippling illness (the longer version of the law already has that baked in, but I've always wanted to name a corollary). And we already took away Bond's women and martinis! :)

        More seriously, the threats that our zombie Bond face are probably going to be people wielding the supernatural. If the British government has supernatural agents, then other countries probably do too. The later Pirates movies introduce a wacky amount of magic that can do all sorts of things, so it's not that much of a stretch to think that magic is everywhere. There's also the standby storyline of an agent disavowed by his government in the name of expedient amorality, which cuts the umbilical cord and sets him against the agency that made him everything he is.

  Good job! Really communicates the horror of interacting with an agent of an unfriendly superintelligence, ie. Her Majesty's Government.
  ```

  - u/rhaps0dy4:
    ```
    Why is Her Majesty's Government an unfriendly superintelligence?

    Emphasis on super.

      Perhaps it would be helpful to review [A study in emerald.](http://www.neilgaiman.com/mediafiles/exclusive/shortstories/emerald.pdf)

      Link is a PDF, story written by Neil Gaiman.

      I believe it is a superintelligence in the same way the hivemind of /r/HPMOR was able to find a solution greater than any one mind could.

      ```
      It's probably not _really_ super, but it sort of feels that way here, emotionally, in the "alien, vast and self-interested" way.

  I liked the setting. Captian hook in PotC? Great.

  Yet the story was too short. THe idea let's use the undead curse as an asset is pretty old. I would loved to see who would they use them to fight against.
  ```

  - u/diraniola:
    ```
    The obvious answer is everybody. American Revolution is shut down by zombie redcoats. The saying is changed to the Moon never sets on the British Empire. The church will lead a crusade against them as practitioners of Sorcery Most Foul. This will either be like all other fights against nigh-invulnerable immortals and be an exercise in futility, or the divine power will smite the undead soldiers who have turned away from sound strategy in their empowered state.
