  I can't cut and paste from Google Docs, apparently.

  When you're discussing "The Ritual of the Calling of the Engineer" you mix up Boomer and Brenda. Which confused me for a moment.

    Thank you kindly for the correction; I've now fixed it.

  That ending... I completely forgot about how you usually ended these and it managed to catch me by surprise. Wonderful cliff-hanger... but now I want more. >_<

  Keep on writing, I'm very much enjoying it. :)

    I knew where I wanted to end this Book, and I wanted this particular Book-ending enough to override the standard number of chapters - I'm glad my choice paid off. :)
