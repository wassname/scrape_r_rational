## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding and Writing Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*
* Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is *also* the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  I'm currently plotting out a story where the protagonist has the power to passively take on some of the qualities of the organisms he consumes. This is subject to the square cube law and other such realisms, so eating a bunch of ants will not make him tens of times stronger. 

  The power will generally make the character into a sort of optimum combination of the things he's eaten, but he'll never become very inhuman. At most, he'll be a sort of beastman that looks mostly human but with a few animal traits. 

  Example: Eating snails for extensible eye stalks, eating cats to gain claws, lyrebirds for vocal mimicry, etc.

  What are some interesting traits for him to gain from his food?

  Bonus round: What are some interesting supernatural/alien organisms from other settings for him to consume?

    One interesting thing would be creatures that alter his mind in some way. While humans have a variety of things that set them apart from other animals mentally (eg. language), there are other things that we are not so good at. One example would be processing multiple inputs - an octopus has a lot of its neural matter stored in it's limbs, and of course has to control eight of them. Another example would be processing other senses that might be picked up, like echolocation, which would need a specialised brain structure to be used more effectively. Other animals presumably have other things that they may be able to exceed humans at mentally (memory, maybe?) but google didn't help much with that.

    One other thing to maybe consider is whether a sufficiently complex artificial circuit could be considered a very narrow organism. It may be kind of interesting and/or humorous to have the protagonist blend up a phone to eat, and then become slightly better at mathematics, or alternatively be somewhat disappointed.

    Another thing to consider is to what level things become conceptually more like what he eats, and at what level his traits become literally like what he eats. Both bones and exoskeletons can be useful in certain circumstances, but will both become more developed, or will one start to outweigh the other? Will eating an animal with eyes more suited for night vision and nocturnal activity make colour vision and diurnal activity harder? Lot's of questions - and the issue of slowly becoming less intelligent if humans aren't eaten, because if I became more and more like a crocodile every day in order to get that sweet, sweet, murder rolling tactic, I wouldn't want to gain the brain of a crocodile in the process.

    Will habits get imprinted? There is a useful element in the form of easy muscle memory for things like flight, climbing, and fang extension, but also the issue of getting very interested in an animals natural prey, or alternatively trying to get friendly with the same species.

    That's all I can think of at the moment, though it is a very interesting concept.

      > Both bones and exoskeletons can be useful in certain circumstances, but will both become more developed, or will one start to outweigh the other? 

      This gets me thinking about straight-up contradictive systems, such as hydraulic movement of limbs from spiders, compared to the extensor muscles of humans.
      ```

      - u/dinoseen:
        ```
        In this specific example, could they work together? Would there be any benefit, things that one is better at doing than the other?
        ```

        - u/NZPIEFACE:
          ```
          I have absolutely no idea.

          I don't know the specifics of the spider's hydraulic system, I only know that it exists and is completely different from what vertebrae use.
          ```

      Wow, you raise a lot of good points. The way I'm thinking of doing it is relatively tame, in that the character generally (but not exclusively) gains positive traits, and there's a pretty low cap on how inhuman he can get - something like a beastman at most. I think it would be nice to have a chapter or arc exploring more radical changes, though. And I love the phone idea!

      In regards to exoskeleton vs bones and things like that, I'm tending towards having the power take a "best of both worlds" approach. In regards to habits and neural changes, there will be some shift towards the more animalistic in some ways, but for the most part nothing too extreme. Finding raw meat appetising, lowered inhibitions towards violence, etc, but I still want to keep it in the realm of "animal qualities made use of by a human mind". 

      If you happen to feel like adding more, be my guest! Regardless, thanks for the great comment :)

    How about an elephant's resistance to cancer? Humans have 1 copy of the P53 gene, which prevents cells from becoming tumors. Elephants have 20 of them. 

    A cat's vastly more efficient kidney, which allows them to drink salt water and be fine. 

    Ability to see into a wider color spectrum and hear lower and higher frequencies? Many animals have those, some have both. 

    There's a lot of variance between people, even. Would you be able to eat another human and get their superior characteristics?  Like faster twitch muscles, lactic acid resistance, greater intelligence?
    ```

    - u/dinoseen:
      ```
      All good ideas, thanks! In regards to cannibalism (if it can even be called that when you have this power) I would say yes, but you wouldn't get the full upgrade and it wouldn't be cumulative. So you wouldn't get all of someone's intelligence after eating them, it'd be more fractional, and you couldn't get smarter and smarter by eating more people - you'd only be as smart as the smartest person you've eaten at most (more likely the average of all brain matter instead). Obviously this goes for the rest of the body too.

      For obvious reasons, this probably won't be explored much or at all in the actual story, at least in a practical sense.

    I second echolocation mentioned above; certain humans are already capable of a mild form of it, and at the level of dolphins and bats, it effectively neutralizes most (natural) forms of stealth.

    I'd also suggest navigational abilities - some migratory organisms are able to orient themselves based on Earth's magnetic field, and salmon are able to instinctively return to their birthplace for spawning.

    Also, there's an octopus species (can't recall the name right now) that can not only alter its skin colour but also its skin texture, for amazing camouflage.  It can easily deceive anything that relies primarily on sight for hunting (i.e., most primates).

    A great source for more ideas would be the Tier Zoo channel on YouTube - virtually all the videos are about hightlighting the various traits and abilities of various animals, but in the context of presenting them as playable characters in an MMORPG.

    [Mantis Shrimp](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantis_shrimp) have some of the most complex eyes in the animal kingdom and are relatively easy to obtain (in comparison with some animals here). There's some other very cool stuff they can do, but probably won't work due to square cube laws. For example, they can accelerate up to 100km/s^2, hitting hard enough to create shockwaves.

    [Naked mole rats](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naked_mole-rat) are practically immune to cancer, caused by better DNA repair systems, which also serve to extend their lifespans. They can survive a very long time in low oxygen environments (though this might not translate to a larger organism). They also can't feel pain from capsaicin or acid.

    Human muscle tradesoff strength for endurance, enough that other primates are all stronger than us, so additional strength seems like an obvious trait.
    ```

  - u/maybealreadytaken:

    octopus/cephalopods have been suggested already. another trait to them though is there eyes are contrast based, not colour making it easier for them to spot hiding things, also their skin has some receptive quality. and the blue ringed octopus (which might be hard to get) has great venom.

    &#x200B;

    jelly fish could make it painful to touch and transparent if theres a use for it. lobsters claw strength and ability to keep growing maybe? im pretty sure there nearly immortal aswell. electric eels to generate electricity. and sharks have unlimited teeth (plus they have teeth skin so you could jank it up and let him administer venom through punches)

    moving on to creepy crawlys spiders have venom, web, multiple eyes and some have hydraulic muscles. worms have two hearts. mosquito's blood sucking ability might have a use (i dont know what). cicadas can make that noise which would probably be deafening at the size of a person. and some species of grass hoppers have interlocking gear legs.

    glow worms and angler fish can glow in the dark. help out whatever night vision you have. angler fish could have a way to hide it unlike glow worms though

    poison dart frogs are nifty.

    i cant think of anything right now, maybe termites? but something should let him eat cellulose.

    and maybe if you can think of a way to implement it alot of creatures go through metamorphisis (tadpoles, catapillers, grasshoppers etc to go through multiple metamorphisis?).

    &#x200B;

    maybe consider how much something has to count as food or you could just boil bones and drink boiled bone water to gain dinosaur/other extinct creature powers.

      also eucalyptis trees when heated up release flammable gas. so you could maybe become firebreathing eventually.

      &#x200B;

      and oysters make pearls, so you have a nice way to make money.

    Many birds have far more densely packed neurons than humans do. The main limiting factor [seems to be](http://www.research.ufl.edu/publications/explore/v12n2/extract1.html) that small neurons have short lifespans and neurons need to last for an animal's full lifespan, but you can always eat a larger, longer-lived animal or just keep your own neural hardiness.

    [This scaling of neuron size is one of the main reasons why large animals need larger brains than equally complex small animals.](https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/03/25/neurons-and-intelligence-a-birdbrained-perspective/) Simply have your character buy and eat some finches and (if they are smart about which traits they gain, then) they should become far more intelligent.

  I'm about 3/4 of the way through a magical youth story, with the powers described [in this munchkinry thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/bq4y0i/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/eo2v0kq/). The protagonist is trapped in the atrium of a convention center by goons who seem intent on capturing him. He's got a disassembled Taser for use as ammunition for the gravity-marble trick.

  The convention center atrium is ~11 stories tall, and shaped like a pyramid. The apex story is a maintenance catwalk with a door that opens onto the mechanical floor of the building, above the 10th floor. Floors 10 through 1 have floor-to-ceiling glass windows that look out onto the atrium. Floor 1 also has four open-air bridges reaching across the atrium in a `#` shape; these provide seating areas for the first-floor food court as well as providing access to the mezzanine underneath. The mezzanine floors under the bridges serve as a ticket hall for the railway station on the next level down. Looking down from the top of the atrium, in the space between the bridges, you can see the train platforms, but not the tracks. The tracks' ceilings are the undersides of the mezzanine and bridges. With me so far? Good.

  Does it make more sense for the magical youth to escape:

  - through the maintenance level
  - by smashing a window and going through the convention center
  - by landing on the train platform and pushing through the platform doors into the train tunnel, and escaping through the train tunnels

  In a lot of Gamer fanfictions the main character, the Gamer, can learn skills at a vastly accelerated rate. Most abilities in the relevant setting can be learned, including mundane skills and some supernatural skills/abilities. Skills generally scale linearly (i.e. if "Running 1" gives +2% to speed the "Running 5" would give +10% speed) however the learning rate is sublinear, meaning that the biggest return for time spent training is in the early skill levels. Further usually the learning rate is significantly boosted while the skills are used in combat. Stats can also be trained following a similar framework and at certain benchmarks(at some multiple of 50) a special benefit is unlocked, though there are no discernible pattern to the power and usefulness of these.

  This is intentionally being kept somewhat vague because protagonists in these stories usually don't have access to detailed knowledge to the skills and abilities that are available to them.

  Suppose you were in a position of the Gamer and you wanted to grow as powerful within a limited time span, what would your general strategies be?

  I'll post a few character sheets for gamers as examples in the comments below
  ```

  - u/jtolmar:
    ```
    The most initially useful abilities are information gathering, and apparently the fastest skill growth comes with combat, so it seems like you should start with seeing if this world has any sort of bards or combat librarians and try to apprentice under them. Hopefully that leads to knowing more about what's possible in this fictional world.

    Given that knowledge, try to learn the most powerful skill (like politician or dark wizard) and see if your experience mechanic lets you reach a sufficiently formidable level of that to just win. This is fiction so presumably it's not that exploitable, but you need to your due diligence.

    Once you've confirmed that you indeed have diminishing returns on learning anything, choose combinations of skills that are unlikely to have been combined before and see what you get. You're more likely to uncover some outsized opportunity at the intersection of druidism and necromancy than you are at the intersection of swordsmanship and shieldsmanship - even though the latter pair is probably more synergistic, you'd expect someone to have noticed and the results to be a regular part of the world, so you can't get a comparative advantage out of it.
    ```

    Assuming it’s our world, I’d study up on some mundane things on Wikipedia, then go to the library (probably run there to see if that unlocks the skill) and study some different mundane things to see if there’s a noticeable difference in speed of acquisition based on quality of source. Depending on what I figure out, I’d spend more time trying to understand the system further and figure out its limits.

    Once I figure that out, I study languages at the appropriate source in the hopes that at some point I just get instant acquisition. Probably study some self-help books and see if I can pick up anything that’ll directly boost my learning/XP gain. 

    If that works, I’d get Latin and Hebrew and then start studying occultism/kabbalah/magic and see if anything supernatural starts working really well.

    In my downtime I’d probably try out new hobbies that could result in skill unlocks, like biking, rock climbing, swimming, yoga, meditation, and fencing if I knew about the combat rule, though maybe that’d be how I would discover it.

    To generalize to any world, I’d first try to learn what I can about the system by getting a lot of skills to level 1, then try to learn languages (large utility) and meta-skills, then go for whatever supernatural abilities that should now be easier to acquire.
    ```

    - u/Sonderjye:
      ```
      What limits would you be spending time figuring out and how would you do it? 

      Suppose that you found yourself in a generic fantasy world with a large number of magical branches and you had to prioritize which ones that you would acquire and train within your time limit. What criteria would you use for which ones to pursue?
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        It’s hard to know what limits I would be figuring out without knowing what those limits are, but generally speaking I’d try to see if there’s any pattern in the skills I get and how I benefit from getting them. For example, if all the bonuses are physical, I’m probably unlikely to find a skill that’ll boost my learning skills. Discovering the fact that skills progress linearly would also be important.

        My first priority would be any magic that could help me learn faster and/or acquire more information and skills. After getting the first few levels of that, I’d focus on something to directly increase my power, probably something intelligence-boosting or defensive. At some point I’d be paranoid about being found out so I’d want to be strong enough to defend myself in case the wrong people find out. Probably stealth as well.
        ```

    The first thing to do would obviously be to hammer out as much details of the gamer framework as possible. Like in paragamer, the “max skill slots” mentioned will require a significantly different strategy than one without that feature, which I assume this would be. 

    Second is figuring out whether your Gamer-ness is internal only, or being imposed on the world. Are dungeons appearing, and do they interact with things other than yourself? If so, those are a natural priority for combat experience. 

    From there, the best thing that can probably be done is amass as many skills as you quickly can, since stacking passive skills freely is OP and making it so you can potentially train multiple skills at once. If “skill books” exist, determine if they can be used digitally. If so, start torrenting every ebook collection you can find. If not, go to the nearest book store and get all the ones you can identify, leveling your thief skills if the consumption is discreet and buying them if not. 

    Any further specific strategies are dependent on the details of the Game. Anything that increases earned HP? Probably go for that. Is there magic? Probably the best bet to invest in, but possibly not if “gamer’s body” isn’t a thing. Whether to go specialist or multi-spec stats depends on whether the benchmark benefits show diminishing or multiplicative returns. Search for any synergies, obviously, like if the Parkour skill gives a speed boost, then doing the occasional flip could let you run faster than not.
    ```

    - u/Sonderjye:
      ```
      Lots of good points. 

      How does your strategy change if there is a max skill rank compared to that not being the case?
      ```
