  I'm going to do something different from the usual story recommendations. I will be posting the authors I follow on reddit.

  * [Luna Lovewell](https://www.reddit.com/r/Luna_Lovewell/) - She is an author who started out by posting to /r/writingprompts and has never failed to write a short story that I enjoyed reading and feels self-contained when I normally dislike short stories. My favorite story by her is [The Batman Delusion](https://www.reddit.com/r/Luna_Lovewell/comments/6h9hxn/the_batman_delusion/) which is a crossover between Batman and Inception.

  * [Leoduhvinci](https://www.reddit.com/r/leoduhvinci/) - He mainly writes adventure stories and just like Luna, got his start by posting to /r/writingprompts. While I can't say the characters are rational, they are well-developed and what I find rational are his settings. He is amazing at writing how the fantastical would realistically influence the world. In fact, he has two books available for free and one book heavily discounted on Amazon [today](https://www.reddit.com/r/leoduhvinci/comments/7ay4fv/free_and_discount_day/) only.

  * [The Snake Report](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSnakeReport/) - Okay, okay, this isn't an author, but it's the only story written by wercwercwerc that I'm paying attention to. It's an amusing story of how a man has reincarnated as a magical snake in an RPG-like world and while it starts out as a comedy about horrifying situations, in the most recent chapters it has evolved into a mystery about how the current world's magic and where it came from.

  * [Demons Dance Alone](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/search?q=author%3Ademons_dance_alone&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=relevance&t=all) - A great horror story writer. I don't think he posts to /r/nosleep anymore, but I've been going through all of the stories he used to post. His stories often include family horror (how do you deal with a monster when you are related to the monster?) and some supernatural.

  Is there anyone you follow who writes and posts to reddit?

    Following up on this to share my single favorite entry on r/WritingPrompts that isn’t as easy to find now that it’s no longer the top post. [A day before the Earth is destroyed by a collision with a rogue planet, time freezes. You, a completely normal person are untouched and cannot die. Text on your arm appears that reads, "however long it takes, save us".](https://www.reddit.com/r/PaulsWPAccount/comments/3q223j/index/)

    The closest thing I can compare it to is The Martian, but it’s not *as* rational and it’s appeal for me was very different. As a person with autism, the story of a man basically trapped alone with his thoughts and having to solve an intellectual problem with no clear solution in order to escape social isolation *hit home hard*. 

    Reading this forced me to confront some dark existential fears within myself that I couldn’t even admit to feeling. Seeing that fear of indefinite social isolation presented so well made me bawl in anguish for hours on end. I emerged with a better understanding of myself and will be forever thankful for the dark place it took me to.

  I caught up with With This Ring and holy shit holy shit holy shit is there a lot to process.  It's a great read if you're an obsessive type who can't stop once they get into something, and munchkinry is the primary weapon of the protagonist.
  ```

  - u/sicutumbo:
    ```
    While not the *best* rational fic out there, there is a lot to like about WTR. Character interaction is well done, dialogue is realistic, combat is continually interesting, and there are just so many moving parts that are just begging to be munchkined.

    Also, it's hard to understate the value of a sizable update ***every single day***, and that the author takes community advice, criticism, and general comments with due respect.

    Piggybacking off of that Young Justice SI recommendation, I'll promote [Life Ore Death](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/life-ore-death-young-justice-crossover.489535/), a Young Justice Not-SI story.  

    The main character is Renka, an OC with Feruchemy (from *Mistborn*) as a power set, a history of being a wanted runaway in a violent empire, and no knowledge of Earth before she drops in.  The first thing she does on-screen is ask for a meeting with Superman, because being a hero is better than her other option of being a criminal.  She has mildly blue-and-orange morality which puts her into conflict with the Team, and is learning the language throughout her time there (though most noticeably at the start) which has some funny moments as well.

    It's a highly underrated story IMO, and the (pseudo) predictability and consistency in both her magic and her interactions with people are a good fit for here.

      Thank you! This story is well done, and I'm still waiting for the big reveals if there are any one with that "Father" in the first chapter, and why she appears to have attracted R's attention in the past..

    Third or fourthing With this Ring . . . I could praise it's various virtuous, or just tell you it's the part of my morning ritual that puts a smile on my face: Shower, Shave, Dress, make coffee, read potentially comic story about how someone with schizo-technology would work towards making an irrational world *sane*.

  Now that I’ve finally finished the RPG/comedy podcast [The Adventure Zone](http://www.maximumfun.org/adventure-zone/ep-1-here-there-be-gerblins-chapter-one), I can wholeheartedly recommend it as hella fun pulp fantasy. It’s put on by the same guys behind the comedy podcast/VRV Exclusive TV show [My Brother My Brother and Me](http://www.maximumfun.org/my-brother-my-brother-and-me/mbmbam-336-twenty-something-teen) and the YouTube series [Monster Factory](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaDrN74SfdT6duuVl_8qxJ5eaaPHRX_ij) and [Car Boys](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaDrN74SfdT6FvTs9d2JPLJnVRjnjIlfo), which are all worth checking out, as these hilarious improv comedians play Dungeons & Dragons with their professional radio personality father.

  It’s like HarmonQuest, except I like it more in every single way and there is a lot more of it. The players and DM are better improvisers and have great rapport with one another, all of the characters are funny and likable, the scenarios they get involved in are very imaginative, and the overarching plot may be one of the best examples I’ve ever seen of [Cerberous Syndrome](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CerebusSyndrome) with a wonderfully emotional conclusion. It’s not very rational, especially at the beginning, but I was damn satisfied by it.

  [Zombie Bureaucrat](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/zombie-bureaucrat-warcraft-si.583054/) - SI ends up as a forsaken and the director of espionage for Sylvanas' new race. Digging the lack of combat in favour of intrigue.

  I've been reading some quests on Spacebattles and Sufficient Velocity recently. In case you don't know what quests are, they're choose your own adventure stories where the readers vote on the course of action that the main character will take. Here are my recommendations:

  [Forge of Destiny](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/forge-of-destiny-xianxia-quest.35583/) is a xianxia-style quest. The story is good, though slow-paced, and the magic system is pretty interesting. 

  [Paths of Civilization](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/paths-of-civilization.36410/) has already been mentioned on this sub, but it's a very good civilization-style quest where the readers play as successive kings of a civilization. The details are surprisingly historically accurate in terms of how the technology develops.

  [Hunger](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/hunger-frozen-disney-dark-fantasy-au.40401/) is a quest where the readers control Elsa in a dark AU of Frozen where Elsa's powers come with the cost of a constant hunger for heat and food, including human flesh.

  Ooh I actually have something new to contribute to one of these. I don't think this game has been mentioned anywhere else on the sub, though I might be wrong.

  Doki doki literature club is a free steam game that has themes that this sub tends to enjoy/talk about. I want to remain as vague as possible to avoid spoiling any of it though. It's a "dating sim" - read the steam store page description (I skipped it and dove into the game and regretted doing that later) and try to get the bad route first (don't date anyone), that's probably the best way to see if you'll like it. Getting the good route might be good too but I've only finished the bad one so far.


  [After you play that one, a similar game is](#s " "save the date," though I think that one *has* been mentioned elsewhere. DDLC is pretty much STD except longer and a bit more elaborate, although I'm still not sure if I've actually gotten all the STD endings lol.")

  ***

  I also think it's a good idea to caution people away from stuff sometimes. "the leftovers" tv series has pretty high ratings on metacritic but at least the first episode is pretty irrational.

  I also watched a few episodes of "supernatural" and that's not really rational either.

  I finished volume 1 of [The Wandering Inn](https://wanderinginn.wordpress.com/) the other day and found every chapter engaging. Has fantastically written characters who are trying so hard in a world that just doesn't care about them.

  Also completed recently [The Hill of Swords](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6154638/1/The-Hill-of-Swords). A Fate/stay night crossover with Familiar of Zero. Has great chemistry between the two leads as you watch Shirou over the course of the story influence a stubborn child Louise into a capable and rational adult.

  Finally, there's [Beyond the Outer Gate Lies](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10202330/1/Beyond-the-Outer-Gate-Lies). A Dresden Files crossover with Highschool DxD about one, world-weary Wizards adventures in a (comedy/harem/magical) high school. He's just so underwhelmed with teenagers and their problems. There's also [Beyond the Outer Gates Lies… A high school library?](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10752206/1/Beyond-the-Outer-Gates-Lies-A-high-school-library), a continuation by a different author. It's more focused on harems than plot though, but I still enjoyed it.

    Does anyone know what happened to Gabriel Blessing? He hasn't updated any of his fantastic stories since 2014. By this point, I've been assuming that he died. But confirmation one way or another would be appreciated.
    ```

    - u/hatter0:

      Same thing that happens to most fanfiction writers i bet. They just kinda...stop. Which is a dam shame, because he was a good writer.
      ```

      - u/xamueljones:
        ```
        While it's possible that he just stopped, I doubt it. He was well known for being such a prolific writer that he would joke about having an Anti-Writer's Block. Him stopping like this was way too abrupt at the time. It would make more sense if he took longer and longer to post in between chapters beforehand (and he was going at a fairly rapid pace at the time).

        Furthermore, he even has another chapter of [Beyond the Outer Gate Lies](https://m.fanfiction.net/topic/88086/107502467/1/Compilation-Beyond-the-Outer-Gates-Lies-Dragons-by-Gabriel-Blessing) ready for posting that hasn't gotten onto the fanfiction website (the 'fourth' chapter starts halfway down the second page, just search for 'My Inner Feminine Side?').

        Also, there's a RWBY [snippet](https://www.fanfiction.net/topic/88086/81161745/100/Anti-Writers-Block) by him. Just scroll down to find it in the middle of the page. It's the very last thing he ever wrote (with the exception of three comment replies further down on the same page).

  Recently re-read webcomic http://unicornjelly.com/uni001.html and its just such a great work of fiction. In scope and detail and execution. 

  Story plays in another universe with very different laws of physics; see [here](http://unicornjelly.com/alt115.html). All planned out in sufficient detail to satisfy /r/rational's requirements. 

  Author is (in)famous Jennifer Diane Reitz, known here as author of [Caelum Est Conterrens](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/69770/friendship-is-optimal-caelum-est-conterrens).

    I highly Recommend you complete the full story By reading the sequel [Pastel Defender Heliotrope](http://www.pasteldefender.com/)  I have a hardcover of Unicorn Jelly and need to buy the same for PDH.

    Edit: It covers many of the threads you thought were already well tied off.
