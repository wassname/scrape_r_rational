  "Unlimited power requires unlimited energy" (rephrased) isn't a valid argument against the proposition that a superintelligence would be extremely powerful.

  That's like saying "Accelerating to the speed of light would require infinite energy, therefore it is impossible to travel faster than 5 km/h"

  Guys, I know Yudkowsky is obsessed over AI, but that doesn't mean we have to post every single thing remotly related to AI on this subreddit. 
  Btw, QQ ( the comic linked in this post ) is nowhere near anything rational, it's just an occasionally amusing comic where the author demonstrates his views on what is his vision of a healthy sex life. Also indie rock snobism.

  Jeph Jacques' comic features hipsters in a coffee shop making snarky comics, who incidentally happen to have robot AI companions.

  I think this is the first time that there is serious discussion on their post-singularity world, if it could be called that. Ironically, the combat droid Bubbles is the AI that has the most to say on the subject and I like her logic.

  The follow-up comic  "Happy Thoughts" takes it a step further discussing the Singularity AI p-zombie simulating the 'cold uncaring universe'

    I think Jeph is misusing the concept of p-Zombies here.

    If you can tell whether the singularity intelligence is conscious or not, it's not a p-Zombie. It might be one of Peter Watts or Karl Schroeder's non-conscious minds (like Artificial Nature, or Thalience, or the vampires of Blindsight), but they're not p-Zombies because you CAN distinguish their behavior from those of conscious minds.

    And if Bubbles is bringing it up, that means that AIs have no better understanding of artificial intelligence than we do.

    Oooh.

    Now that actually makes sense.

      Okay, THAT is a good explanation, especially given that they are modeled on human minds. If they were less human, they might be more consistent (and therefore presumably more transparent to self-reflection).
      ```

      ```
      >Bubbles: "but the spark that gives rise to emergent consciousness is not fully understood."

      You might be right.
      ```

    Why do people think p-zombies is a valid concept? One of its essential premises is [fundamentally magical thinking](https://scientiasalon.wordpress.com/2014/08/04/p-zombies-are-inconceivable-with-notes-on-the-idea-of-metaphysical-possibility/) -- 'because I can think of a world where X is the case, X must be possible'.

    Not really trying to prompt a discussion here, just disappointed that a discussion that started off credible ended up at p-zombies.

      ```
      He also appears to conflate morality with consciousness in the second comic, where the entire point of p-zombies (as nonsensical as the concept is) is that they are externally indistinguishable from conscious entities.
      ```

      - u/ArgentStonecutter:
        ```
        Therefore whether a superintelligence was a p-Zombie or not wouldn't change its morality.
        ```

    - u/Bowbreaker:
      ```
      > just disappointed that a discussion that started off credible ended up at p-zombies.

      More importantly, it mentions the term p-zombies but shows that either the character or the author himself really doesn't understand what the term means, thus harming credibility even further.

      It's a work of fiction, so in that case it's literally true. Philosophical zombies are indeed possible (in that fictional world) if the author imagines that they are possible.
      ```

      - u/tilkau:
        ```
        That's true. However the rest of the comic (and I mean the entire comic, not just this strip) does seem to be focused near-exclusively on real world, current or relatively near future issues. That's why this reads to me as either a misinformed author, or one who's referencing p-zombies solely because it sounds interesting.
        ```

- u/Chronophilia:
  ```
  The creator of *Questionable Content* does like to troll his readers from time to time, so don't take anything he writes too seriously. Actually, don't take anything anyone ever writes too seriously, it's a good general principle.

  Still, if you want to know if the comic actually contains godlike AIs that have hidden themselves from the world, t[his other comic is probably relevant.](http://www.questionablecontent.net/view.php?comic=2070)
  ```

    ```
    There's also a few either side of that one that somewhat address the "You have AI, why isn't this a bigger deal?" question.
    ```
