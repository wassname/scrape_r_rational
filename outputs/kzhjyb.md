  ```
  Note: Epilogue of Book 2, not of the work as a whole. 

  It's a good point to catch up to if you're the kind of reader who likes to take things in chunks rather than chapter-by-chapter, though.

    Scared me there!  Can we have title flairs for that?

  Fantastic! I read a bit of book 2 but I decided to wait and read it all through at once, and now I can.
