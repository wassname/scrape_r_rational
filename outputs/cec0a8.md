  Another chapter! Some meta-ish author's notes:

  Despite being much more free to write during the summer (I am a graduate student), this chapter took quite a bit of time to produce. The truth is that, while I had a few solid characters and a vague-ish destination for the overall plot in mind, I never successfully sat down and nailed down how it would all work out. That's not to say I didn't *try.* I've spent (way too) many afternoons stressing about this little side project of mine. I kept telling myself that it was okay, that many authors prefer the 'gardening' technique of plotting, but my own story was fighting against me.

  So now, after about a year (!), there's actually a plot structure. I have a story, and it's just up to me not to mess it up. I'm slightly afraid knowing the structure might negatively affect my writing (see the last three seasons of a certain fantasy TV series), but anything's worth it if I can just h*cking write, no more per-chapter restructuring. For funsies, my current estimate for the total length is 26 chapters.

  As always, I still have a lot to learn, and this chapter was pretty different, so make sure to nuke that sub button and drop a comment below to tell me what you think.

  Edit: I made a minor change to the part where Carol stands up to Rose at the end. Same general event happens, but the conversation is less nonsensical.

  I'm slightly angry, mostly because this brings back memories of team games back in school. 

  Well done, and a welcome surprise to see this update :D
