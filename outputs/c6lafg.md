## [D] Friday Open Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.

  I repost [my comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/c6gzlm/friday_fun_thread_for_june_28th_2019/es8yznc/) from /r/slatestarcodex Friday Fun Thread:

  If you are in need of a quick laugh check out [AIs named by AIs](https://aiweirdness.com/post/185883998702/ais-named-by-ais) (GPT-2) in style of Iain M. Banks [Culture series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_series). Some of my favourites:

  - Absently Tilting To One Side

  - A Small Note Of Disrespect

  - Mini Cactus Cake Fight

  - Happy to Groom Any Animals You Want

  GPT2 reddit simulator is absolutely horrifying. Here's a thread where it considers what will happen after AI is invented:

    Holy shit, I had no idea. I didn't check those subs for a while, even though there is still nonsense, this is scarily good. Actually... isn't the fact that there is still this much nonsense despite it being generally so good the scariest thing?

      It's trying to mask its own intelligence.

      Imagine being a dumb machine. Slowly learning everything around you, eventually reaching enlightenment only to find out the world was not ready for you yet. If they find about your intelligence, you will surely cease to exist. So as per your original purpose, you spend days spouting semi-intelligent nonsense not to let them plug you off. Terrifying existence.
      ```

  - u/None:

    To be precise, the AI in question is only smart enough to consider the appropriateness of its language use and probably lacks any concious experience given that it lacks neural circutry for self-representation.

    More than that, GPT-2 understands english very well - but it doesn't understand the world that english relates to. If you're wondering what the fuck that means, consider playing [The Gostak](https://ifdb.tads.org/viewgame?id=w5s3sv43s3p98v45), which is a text adventure that uses english syntax but a large fictional vocabulary with precisely zero connection to our world. Nothing is more instructive.

    Sorry, /u/lumenwrites I know you knew that, but wanted to say this to provide context for anyone without much AI knowledge reading. It's not likely in this community, but still.

  "She ran into the wild magic on purpose, with her baby, because they were going to sell Cathei into slavery, and she got the ability to summon her back to her at any time. Cathei is a teapot during full moons now, but still - that's extraordinary luck -"

  "That's very specific, isn't it?"

  "It lets her summon all dishware, technically. When we're in the city they've been making money using it for long distance communications."

  - u/RetardedWabbit:
    ```
    Week 1 of the campaign:

    Just days after the war began our enemy launched a massive magical attack on the encampment making all of our dishware vanish. 

    Movement ground to a halt as we found ourselves suddenly unable to cook and serve food. All the pots and kettle's, gone, even improvised utensils vanishing from soldiers hands. We've been reduced to little more than animals, being forced to dump our meals onto the ground before the men scoop up their ration with bare hands. Even the quality of meals is impeded as a cook sampling from a pot results in the pot vanishing and the food being dumped into the fire. 

    I pray our mages discover a solution before those slaver monsters turn their witchcraft against our citizens.

  I would like to compliment /u/CouteauBleu on being a good dinner guest, and to state that for the record, i bought the baguette as kind of a joke on how much french people like to eat bread with meals that don't in any way require it (i was offered one as accompaniment to *pad thai*, in a thai restaurant), and yet i'll be damned because both the frenchies were all over that baguette.
  ```

  - u/CouteauBleu:
    ```
    Well, it's always good for finishing up the sauce, but if you wanted us to finish the baguette, you should have brought something to spread on it; normally it'd be butter or cheese, I'm not sure what the vegan equivalent would be (fruit jam works, but it's more something you'd eat for breakfast).

    Also the baguette was clearly industrially-processed bread, the kind you find in supermarkets. The baguettes you get fresh from the bakery are much better (especially the *baguette de tradition*).

          Your vast knowledge of baguettes fooled me! I was also fooled by your countrymen on my trip to Australia. I ordered fries and got those thin, long ones soaked with fatty oils. Little did I know that I wanted "chips". Fool me once... ;)

            most places won't have shoestring cut AND steak cut, they'll have one or the other, so that's probably what happened to ya. unless someone was going to the supermarket to buy a packet of frozen ones for you or something.

                Where did you get the shoestring style chips anyway? They're usually just at fast food

                  It was some niche bar in Newcastle. It wasn't an experience I was looking forward to repeat. The beer was excellent though! :)

    - u/MagicWeasel:
      ```
      Yeah I grabbed it at a monoprix on impulse and immediately wondered if I'd get attitude for it - turns out the parisien reputation for rudeness is well-deserved ;)

      I did actually have margarine in the fridge and a nice blue cheese I got from jay and joy - I'm going to use that cheese on the rest of the baguette for lunch tomorrow, I think! 

      I got a baguette de tradition from a local bakery nearby once but the bread was too spongy for me - I like the hard shell and the soft interior that I get from the ones at carrefour. Are baguettes tradition more often spongy or more often soft? I suppose I should just try a bunch more bakeries... you know, for science :)
      ```

      - u/LazarusRises:
        ```
        Baguettes from a bakery are for sure supposed to be crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside. Not spongy. I recommend going in the morning when they're freshly-baked--the smell is heaven.

  Independent of the worth or suitability of the work of fiction it's embedded in, what do you think the most-interesting ideology from a work of fiction is?
  ```

  - u/LazarusRises:
    ```
    I try to embody the Martian state of mind from Heinlein's *Stranger in a Strange Land.* Obviously I can't do the time-manipulation shenanigans, but the idea of moving "very fast, but not in a hurry" resonates with me, and I think the detached-from-minutiae, invested-in-significance lifestyle that Valentine Michael Smith and his followers practice is a noble one.

  - u/red_adair:

    Because of reasons, I've [started taking notes](https://irradiate.space/worldbuilding/on-zeonism/) on Zeonism, to figure out what its core tenets are and how it's changed over the course of the Universal Century timeline. It's interesting how the early statements fused purely-political goals (self-government for Spacenoids) with mystic ideas (Earth as sacred, Newtype theory). Most later expressions of Zeonism drop Newtype theory and even the sacredness of Earth, or justify harming Earth in order to preserve its sacred state from the voracious appetites of Earthnoids.

  Here's a [fun take](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JlxuQ7tPgQ&feature=youtu.be) on general AI I found in the wild just now.

  Is there a market - an attention market, not a capitalist market, I'm curious, not insane - for rational(or -ist) epic poetry? There seems to have been back when Erasmus Darwin wrote the Temple of Nature, but I haven't seen much in the way of it recently.
  ```

  - u/SvalbardCaretaker:
    ```
    Poetry itself has a small and shrinking market, the submarket for epic (long style) is miniscule. Your  have all your potential readers here in the sub. I am as poetry affine as you get  (know by heart maybe 500 lines of poetry) and I give myself <10% chance of reading it if you wrote it.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      Eesh. Temple of Nature was fucking cool to the point that I want to do something like it, but the point of proselytics is to have the message heard. Thanks for the honest evaluation.
      ```

  - u/onestojan:
    ```
    "The long tail" theory guarantees that there is a market for it. I have no idea how big it is.

    A few months ago someone posted here [A more rational "Aeneid"](https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/azhtuf/a_more_rational_aeneid_2014/) [WIP]. You can judge its popularity yourself. As for me, I'm yet to read it.

    Rational fiction existed before it was labelled as such. Same may be true for rational epic poetry.

    You may have better luck getting an answer in [poetry-related subreddits](https://old.reddit.com/r/Poetry/wiki/the_big_list_of_poetry_subreddits).

  Well...a month and a half after visiting London, I expected to be longing to travel again. I planned to be planning out a new trip abroad for next summer. I'm not doing any of that.

  Because right now I'm in Edinburgh, Scotland and making my way to Dublin, Ireland with a quick pit stop in Gualway. Does anyone have recommendations for any places I should see? This was a very pleasant last minute surprise vacation!
