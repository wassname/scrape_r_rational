  That's...a lot of interludes in a row.

  The author seems to be veering more and more into interlude territory. Not counting prologues/epilogues, the Chapter:Interlude ratios per book are on the rise:

  * Book I - 28 Chapters, 0 Interludes (0% Interlude)
  * Book II - 49 Chapters, 11 Interludes (18% Interlude)
  * Book III (in progress) - 23 Chapters, 10 Interludes (30% Interlude)

  As a reader with little authorial experience, I have to wonder what's behind this uptick. Are fans clamoring for more interludes? Has the author always planned for this section of the story to involve a lot of different perspectives? Has the author slowly changed in their writing style and preference? Or are they now just bored of writing from Cat's perspective?

  While I do enjoy the occasional interlude, Cat's chapters are what drew me to the series in the first place (not to mention, they tend to drive the plot forward the most). I'm wondering if this constant rise in interludes is a trend we should expect more of going forward...

    That's a great observation you've made and with some data to back it up too. Just the way I like it. :)

    I expect that we're about halfway through Book 3 based on the example from Book 2 and my feel for the story so far in Book 3. It's quite possible that the final ratio for Book 3 will end up to be quite similar to Book 2.

    > Has the author always planned for this section of the story to involve a lot of different perspectives?

    In comparison to Book 1 it seems to be that there have been a lot more significant characters introduced. And the previously existing characters have also needed (not-Cat) exposition as well.

    > Has the author slowly changed in their writing style and preference?

    I think clearly true given the increasing chapter counts and the total lack of interludes in Book 1. Beyond that, I'm not sure.

    I love Cat's perspective too and wish we had more of it. However, some of the interludes have been just as enjoyable for me. Such as Robber meeting Thief, the Heroes destroying the Tyrants floating fortresses and the recent one with Akua battling the Summer Court.

    I'm enjoying the increased complexity of the plots and counter plots and can't wait to see the final battle for Leisse(sp?).

      I almost want the Diabolist to go out like a total punk. All rage no fury. The real antagonists aren't Akua but the Empress and Aode anyway.
      ```

      - u/MoralRelativity:
        ```
        Yeah, I'm not so sure about that. Cat and Akua have built up such a relationship that I think they're going to be fighting until the end of the series.
        ```

    - u/sitsthewind:
      ```
      Robber meeting Thief is an extra chapter, not an interlude.

      I agree that the Interludes help give us a sense of the increased complexity of what Cat faces though.
      ```

  - u/JanusTheDoorman:
    ```
    I think it's more that as Squire has progressively risen up the power ladder, she becomes more and more concerned with and affected by larger goings on around the world, and without these interludes, having different armies or plotlines horn into the story would seem like they came out of nowhere.

    That was my central complaint about the fae storyline, but everything else regarding Procer, Diabolist, the Free Cities, etc. seems to be building toward a larger conflict involving them all, so I think the interludes are appropriate.

  I really like these heroes and would like to see through the eyes of the Priestess or Champion soon.
  ```

  - u/JdubCT:
    ```
    Champion would probably not be a terribly good PoV. Since she's dealing with a foreign language her internal thoughts wouldn't be anywhere near as amusing as her dialogue is.

    Also, I'm pretty sure Captain just died. =/
    ```

    - u/melmonella:
      ```
      I still don't get that vibe. Captain has much more narrative weight as a Calamity than Champion ever did.
      ```

      - u/JdubCT:
        ```
        The "Do you like monster stories" thing is either a lead-in to a flashback or Champion taking on Captain. You're right that our author shouldn't kill her *lightly* but there's a lot of foreshadowing going on.
        ```

  - u/MoralRelativity:
    ```
    Unfortunately, I can't see that happening. Hanno's perspective is enough for all the necessary plot exposition.
    ```
