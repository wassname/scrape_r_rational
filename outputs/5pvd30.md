  It's the last chapter of the sequence, so you know what that means... Except, it's a little different this time. >:]

  This is also an appropriate time for a few public service announcements: 

  * Feedback is appreciated, especially the kind that tells me what you think I'm doing wrong. 
  * I love, love, love reviews, but if you want to support this story financially too, then [check out my patreon account](https://www.patreon.com/WMBsaltworks) and see if any of the rewards interest you. HSTW is a Creative Commons work, which means that my ability to monetize it in a traditional fashion is limited-to-nonexistent. 
  * If you were wondering, Heroes Save the World is now ten-percent complete, not counting bonus chapters that may or may not happen. 
  * For those who are interested, the average word count of Awful Shadow is 1,565 words/chapter, a slight increase from Not Too Small. 

  Thank you all for reading. The next sequence, *Sharp as Sword Blades*, will begin this Friday.

  New guess: this cabal is playing a game where each person is allotted a certain group of the 100. I imagine the prize depends on the pawns assigned to each player. So if the precognitives are the last ones standing, their patron gets a fraction of what Hannah's patron would get if she wins. 

  I still think they're extradimensional beings who can't quite get used to existing in fleshsuits.
