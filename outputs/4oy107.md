## [RST][FF]Orders of Magnitude: A HPMOR->Significant Digits->Prequel

### Post:

For those who are new: I've been working on a prequel of sorts, to Significant Digits. As we started approaching the closing chapters, it became clear that there were aspects of the world that /u/mrphaethon built that he would not get to explore in depth. Orders of Magnitude hopes to explore that world in more detail. 

The structure of Orders of Magnitude is a bit non-linear. It's actually four stories, all sharing a central theme, and interconnected by history and humanity. I have been keeping r/aih up to date but totally dropped the ball and have not been updating /r/hpmor nor r/rational nor [fanfiction.net](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11914431/)
