  Well, this is certainly a twist.

  I mean, Ray was useful, but a Mama-in-training? She's likely to have extensive knowledge of the outside world. With this in mind, what good would William Minerva be? His first warnings pertained only to things that were already known, so any help from him was going to be outside intel. With Krone in the mix... It is 2045 after all. Maybe she doesn't know much about how the world got to where it is, leaving gaps that Minerva can still fill?

    There's always the chance that Krone is just pretending to help them to lower their guard (so she can hatch whatever plot she has going on later).  It's common for manga authors to end on cliffhangers, so it's possible this isn't an actual solicitation of an alliance?
    ```

    ```
    ...except that we don't know how good Krone is of a liar, and information gained from her could be actively detrimental. After all, if all she wants is goodwill of her bosses, it would be pretty great to make Mama seem incompetent and then *also* deliver the "missing" children. 
    As long as she's even fairly intelligent (and, given this manga, it's dangerous to assume the opposite) then she's much more of a liability than an asset.

      That possibility didn't occur to me. Somehow. (More elaboration [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5hw429/rt_the_promised_neverland_019/db46xtk/))

      Re: her intelligence, we know she's at least smart enough to have consistently gotten perfect test scores during her own stint as a farm child. Granted, we don't know what kinds of intelligence those tests measure.
