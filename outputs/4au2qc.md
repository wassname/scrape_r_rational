  ```
  This is a 'fic of Stargate Atlantis in which the author asks "What if the crew weren't idiots, and had prepared properly for being sent to a place outside our galaxy where they very likely wouldn't be able to get home?"  Short and fun.

    Competence is fun to read. A shame it was never continued.

  - u/None:
    ```
    SGU is sorta what SGA should be, if minus the needless backstabbing.
    ```
