  What is this author most famous for? To help the more casual fans like me remember the relevance.

  Edit: Old list, but for out of the loop readers like me, these are some of Scott’s literary works.

    ```
    Arguably the most on-topic for this subreddit is his novel _[Unsong](http://unsongbook.com/)_.
    ```

    - u/Dragonheart91:

      Definitely. Scott is apparently one of the most well known members of the rational community after Elizer Yudkowsky. I’ve read a lot of Scott’s stuff and didn’t realize it was all by the same author.

        >The Big Yud himself

        I hear Yudkowsky [doesn't really appreciate the nickname](https://twitter.com/esyudkowsky/status/1219327143949111296?lang=en) so we should probably avoid using it, no matter how catchy it might sound.
        ```

        - u/Dragonheart91:

          Thanks. I had no idea. I just thought it was a cute joke. I thought “big yud” like “the big man in charge himself.” (And it is easy and convenient to type.) I had no idea it was related to fat shaming. Frankly I have no idea what Yudkowsky looks like lol.
          ```

  - u/PastafarianGames:
    ```
    One of the things not mentioned there is an absolutely fantastic piece called Meditations on Moloch. It's a critique of... bad equilibria, I guess, a kind of "local maximum, but general near-minimum" degenerate race-to-the-bottom state. (It is both a work of fiction and a political polemic.)
    ```

    - u/DangerouslyUnstable:
      ```
      Meditations on Moloch, I can tolerate anything except the outgroup, and toxoplasma of rage have, together, pretty much crystalized how I view of the world and why it is the way it is. They are probably the three most personally influential pieces of writing I have ever read.
      ```

      - u/Silver_Swift:
        ```
        [In favor of niceness, community and civilisation] (https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/02/23/in-favor-of-niceness-community-and-civilization/) is also up there, for me at least.
        ```

  - u/Excessive_Etcetra:
    ```
    Alexander is most well known for *Slate Star Codex*, a blog in the 'rationalist' blogosphere, basically nonfiction rational writing. He originated as a commenter in the *LessWrong* community which was formed around the writings of Eliezer Yudkowsky who wrote the prototypical rational story: *Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality*.
    ```

    - u/WhispersOfSeaSpiders:
      ```
      Huh, never heard that- have there been any other LessWrong commenters who developed an independent blog or claim to fame, out of curiosity?
      ```

      - u/churidys:
        ```
        Gwern is the other big one, but there are loads of smaller names.
        ```

        - u/Empiricist_or_not:
          ```
          Notable in this context is that Gwern went private recently because he's followed by Musk of SpaceX/Tesla/etc. fame (he said he's tied of getting asked to plug stuff). They are  lso know for "this waifu does not exist" and more recently on hacker news "this anime does not exist" (Machine learning generation of anime faces and body/characters respectively).

          Their website is one of the most exhaustive and systematic investigations of whatever strikes his fancy. 

          *caveat: I don't know or correspond with Gwern. I don't read their stuff half as deeply as I should, but if you plan to skim their site for five minutes make sure you have at least two hours free.
          ```

      - u/DuplexFields:
        ```
        Zvi has a weekly in-depth post on LW about the fight against COVID. In addition to numbers of cases and deaths and predictions thereof, there’s always some science-based hindsight that would have saved 90% of those who’ve died.
        ```

      - u/kryptomicron:
        ```
        Yes, lots – tho maybe not with much of a 'claim to fame' among people already not pretty plugged in to the wider network of related sites.
        ```

  - u/EdenicFaithful:
    ```
    Scott has a list of his most popular articles on [the about page](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/about).

    I recommend checking [Slate Star Codex Abridged](https://www.slatestarcodexabridged.com/) for a great collection of his essays. My favourite was [Beware Isolated Demands For Rigor](https://www.slatestarcodexabridged.com/Beware-Isolated-Demands-For-Rigor).

    As another commenter mentioned, he wrote [Unsong](http://unsongbook.com/).

    I'll add that some other (shorter) stories he has written include […And I Show You How Deep The Rabbit Hole Goes](https://www.slatestarcodexabridged.com/And-I-Show-You-How-Deep-The-Rabbit-Hole-Goes), [It Was You Who Made My Blue Eyes Blue](https://www.slatestarcodexabridged.com/It-Was-You-Who-Made-My-Blue-Eyes-Blue), and [Universal Love, Said The Cactus Person](https://www.slatestarcodexabridged.com/Universal-Love-Said-The-Cactus-Person).

  For a chronicle of the events of the past half a year so from his perspective, and other interesting facts, you may read his second inagural post, [Still Alive](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/still-alive).

  In submitting this as a post, instead of an Open Thread comment, I'm knowingly skirting the scope of the subreddit - nominally, works and discussion of rational fiction - which this is strictly speaking outside of. Still, it's new (and good) content pertaining to the continued activity of a notable ratfic author, so I hope the post is allowed to stand.
  ```

  - u/appropriate-username:
    ```
    Mods told me there are few things they'd remove so you probably don't have much to worry about.
    ```

    - u/LupoCani:
      ```
      Pretty much. Still, I was going to ask forgiveness instead of permission, I thought I should do it properly.
      ```

- u/Jules-LT:
  ```
  Now, what does the August date on that first post *mean*? Is that when he wrote it? Was it available to some people before this public launch?
  ```

- u/None:
  ```
  daily reminder that scott went out of his way back in the day to defend noted white supremacist and former president donald j trump as being totally not racist
  ```

  - u/Newfur:
    ```
    No idea why you're getting downvoted here - that's literally why I stopped reading SSC back in late 2016.
    ```

  - u/therealeconomoy:
    ```
    I typed out a long description of why I think this position you're taking is ridiculous based on easily searchable evidence, however, you're clearly a troll. That is why you have my downvote.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      Please show me your easily searched evidence that he didn't do the thing that he did

        I found your stupid post, y'troll. OOH, yes, the fact that he said that Trump wasn't more racist then the American government, in general, has me  definitely updating my beliefs that he's a horrible racist....
