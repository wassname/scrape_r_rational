## If human sacrifice worked?

### Post:

If Aztec style human sacrifice actually fed some gods and produced magic would it be the rationalist choice to sacrifice a few individuals to prevent the greater suffering a drought could cause or rejuvenate a king to prevent a succession crisis. How much utility does a human sacrifice need to be the rational option. How much rain over how much area for how long do you think an individual human sacrifice must produce to become a rational option for ending droughts or the routine method for irrigating deserts in the ancient world. Or if human sacrifice could of produced portal that could be taken to distant cities to link them it would be a great boon to economic growth and trade.

  Being a rationalist doesn't tell you what ends to value, it just demands that you go after those ends in ways that make sense. You can hold the opinion [Every human life is so valuable murder is always wrong] or you can hold the opinion [I matter the most, followed by my family, followed by the filthy crowd]. These two people would react very differently to finding out that the gods could be bribed with sacrifices. If you're on a scale between the two extremes, you'll decide to go for the sacrifice at different points of necessity/convenience. Most people would sacrifice the innocent child to save the world. Most rationalists would sacrifice the innocent child to find a (magically) perfect vaccine against some horrible disease. Not so many of us would use prisoners for medical research,, even though that would definitely save lives in the long run. With sacrifices to the gods, I similarly expect most of us would not sacrifice people whenever it seemed convenient, but would wait until the utility function looked *very* clear.

  Please, it would be a 'utilitarian' choice, not a 'rationalist' one. A rational decision is one free from cognitive error, aka a 'good' decision. Utilitarianism is a specific moral philosophy that the ends justify the means. Many rationalists like utilitarianism, but they're separate ideas.

    >Utilitarianism is a specific moral philosophy that the ends justify the means.

    I hear this description a lot. It's correct, but there's an unstated point in there - the means affect the ends. People like to illustrate 'the ends justify the means' by allowing horrible things to be done in the name of good outcomes, but the truth is that doing horrible things causes the people doing them to change - this change *must* be counted among the outcomes being evaluated in any kind of *rational* utilitarian calculations.

    I personally think that utilitarianism is useless as a personal philosophy exactly because of the cumulative effects of these mechanism-focused internal changes - you don't just need to consider the effects of the means on the actors, but the effect on the society's moral fabric and norms, the effect on the rule of law, the effect on all witnesses, the effects of the fact that hiding information from those involved can improve utility (knowing that would cause a rational person to be less trusting).. the list goes on basically forever. It's like trying to solve the N-body problem when your forces are all unquantifiable and cannot be directly calculated or observed.

      I like that. I'm saving this post.

        Feel free - I doubt I'm the first to express that in that way. (After a quick google, it looks like its a standard expression of one of the tenets of nonviolent resistance, a la Ghandi)

    Pretty sure that utilitarianism is the philosophy that "*If* the ends justify the means then they're fine to use, no matter the cost." (although obviously, a *rational* utilitarian would look for the least costly means).

    Just a blanket "The ends justify the means." would lead to some *very* disturbing thought processes, and I'm not sure that such a person could even function.

    No, that's consequentialism.  Utiitarianism = consequentialism + the valuable consequences are hedons

      No, that's wrong. That's hedonististic utilitarianism you are describing, but there's also e.g. preference utilitarianism where utility is the satisfaction of preferences, not the maximization of hedons. There's also 'negative utilitarianism' where utility = negative suffering.

  Bearing in mind that rationality doesn't *determine* your goals - a paperclipper or psychopath would obviously have no problem sacrificing tons of people, which is a bit of a problem when it means they'll be vastly more powerful than everyone else - but assuming human goals:

  From an economic perspective, people seem to "value" their lives at about $5 million, IIRC. So something that prevented $5 of inconvenience to a city of a million people would be "worth" the bargain from the market's perspective. (Look at cars, for example.) That's debateably rational or ethical, though.

  In our world, [Giving What We Can](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/research/charities-area/malaria)  tells me it costs around $3500 to save a life from malaria. Someone *donating all the proceeds to charity* could definitely argue that a human sacrifice for something the can sell for more than that is worth it. (Maybe even less, in a setting where you can save lives for less - which is probably true in most low-fantasy medievalesque settings.)

  Preventing some large disaster, like a volcano erupting in a populated area, seems like an obvious one. Appeasing the gods to prevent them chucking asteroids or plagues at you seems pretty ethical, although it raises the question of whether you could kill them instead.

  Droughts and famines can have pretty large death tolls, but that's seperate from the question of when it's *more efficient* to sacrifice people than use conventional irrigation. Which ... God, I don't know. You could fiddle around with QALYs, or use the $5M rule if you're just worldbuilding a reasonably ethical civilization, but that would take work.

  The US sees a few hundred people die from storms and heatwaves and the like, even now. [Like this chart](http://www.nws.noaa.gov/om/hazstats.shtml). So fixing the weather for a large empire would pretty clearly be worth it, even with modern technology. (Again, this goes up the lower the tech level of your setting.)

  You could also look into the economic effects of slavery in the US, which I'd imagine would have an analogue at least *somewhere* in this world. And from a military perspective, sacrificing enemy soldiers for a tactical benefit is a lot like torturing your captives (i.e. probably common when the two enemies can't see eye-to-eye, since it costs your side nothing, but with a lot of treaties banning it in "civilized" cultures.)

  EDIT: Oh! Some people have also suggested that some sort of immortality ritual would be worth it, if the target lived significantly longer than they + the sacrifice would combined.

  [K'iche'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%27iche%27_people) was woken up by the alarm clock blaring by his head. He groaned as he got up.

  He tossed his blankets off and walked into the bathroom where his lowly slaves cleaned and dressed him. In this manner, the slave effectively and efficiently cleaned him. The slave followed him as K'iche' walked to the kitchens for his breakfast. The slave held up his history textbook while K'iche' ate.

  K'iche' focused on memorizing the dates for the fall of the European Cultures and the obvious reasoning behind why their preaching that all sentient beings are equal was clearly false. After all the Great Ones clearly protected everyone important by favoring those who gave them blood sacrifice regularly. Hm....the liver particularly tasted stringy today.

  That reminded him, he needed to get to school soon. K'iche' dismissed his personal slave and walked to the back of the house. Outside was a large barn. Inside were stables with humans inside. These were humans collected from all over the country as prisoners of war, children of slaves, and other inferiors.

  K'iche' took down one of the daggers hanging on the walls and expertly and quickly prepped the standard ritual to slice out the tendons on one slave's leg. K'iche' noted down on a nearby notebook the condition of the slave and what further rituals the slave was still eligible for.

  As the magic blazed up around him, K'iche' tore out the slave's tendons and teleported a mile to his school.

    This poorly written story was meant to show how if human sacrifice was the only option for magical power, then all of human history is drastically changed.

    First we would have far less empathy for strangers and racism would be an acceptable part of everyday life. Note that I delibrately avoided any mention of the slave's gender because to K'iche' the slaves don't even qualify as a person.

    Secondly, cultures which lead to today's modern understanding of ethics and morality wouldn't have been able to develop as their less-empathic neighbors were more successful. I don't have a very god knowledge of the history behind the development of ethics and philosophy, but I think the modern understanding was mainly developed during the Renaissance in Europe.

    Without the cultures mentioned above, this leads to the possibility of cannibalism since in ancient culture and some today, cannibalism was considered an important part of society and even sacred. This it would likely flourish along aside human sacrifice.

    This leads to all sorts of casual tortures and sacrifices accomplished by hurting the 'inferiors' in hourly worship of the Great Ones (imagined or real gods, all powerful God-Kings, or shadowy tyrants) for the most mundane usage such as not walking the distance to school.

    All of the above is just within the first five minutes of considering the consequences of a world with working human sacrifice. It's a Crapsack World for anyone not on the winning side of the sacrificers.

    K'iche' was meant as a reference to a Mayan civilization, but it might be a bad one to make, because I doubt that particular civilization had anything similar to the world I made up.
