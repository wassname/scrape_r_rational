## World-saver's Checklist

### Post:

I've seen a bunch of posts on here asking how one might Munchkin a superpower or situation to save the world.  I've really enjoyed them, but each one seems to leave out the key question: what counts as a world saved?

To me, that's the more-interesting question at the heart of all the ones posted on here.  Is the world saved by eliminating death? by addressing all x-risks?  Should we go further, and talk about a post-scarcity society, or some level of rationality/fulfillment being available to all through optimized education/lifestyle?  What would have to change from where we are now, to make human civilization eutopian?

I have (many) thoughts of my own, which I'll post in the comments; but my main interest is in comparing notes with people.  So: what do you folks think?

Edit: As u/PeridexisErrant pointed out below, saving the world is often seen as stopping threats; optimizing the world is seen as improving it until ideal.  I'm mostly asking about the second one, despite my terminology.

  ```
  One basic criteria to measure how saved and/or eutopian the posited world is "Is DataPacRat going to be alive n years from now, for n > 0?", or, if you need a finer-grained measurement, "What is the likelihood DataPacRat is going to be alive n years from now?" (especially as the first question ceases to be answered 'no' for all n > 100, and the second question continues increasing for ever-larger values of n).

  Reasonably easy to calculate compared to most ways of measuring whether the world is saved or not, possesses a certain amount philosophical justification (and that's without even getting into the semantic arguments about everyone's existence being within 'their' world), and I obviously have a certain amount of incentive to promote this particular standard. :)

  ```
  'Saving the world' is just maintaining the status quo despite potential catastrophes or enemies (such as the election of Giant Meteor 2016).

  The distinct genre of 'improving the world' has much more moral depth, but remains sadly less popular.

- u/Zeikos:
  ```
  I would define it by the total elimination of all (present) existential risks.

  'Saving the world' most of the times simply means 'saving the human race' , you can get into nuances but it's the most common usage, so i wouldn't say that full immortality/post scarcity would a requirement,  while being a good addition.

  All humans will have to agree on the same facts and set the rules of survival from there. Otherwise it is propagating of ideas to convince one side to kill the earth or destroy it for survival...

- u/Nepene:
  ```
  In terms of what we can do today- most diseases which can be annihilated are (diseases being horrific to intellect, social development, and happiness) most humans can live happy, fulfilling lives, environmental damage is minimized, most humans can enjoy clean food and water, have shoes, have clothes, jobs or basic income available to all, cheap treatment of all cheap conditions, full funding of mental healthcare and housing for all, and extensive scientific research.

  In terms of the near future, more use of automated software to reduce accidents, genetic engineering and stem cells to fix conditions and reduce ageing, lazarus technology to revive the dead.
