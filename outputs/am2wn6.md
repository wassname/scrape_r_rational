## [D] Friday Open Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.

  I'm amazed I haven't seen this as a gag yet in a rom-com:

  Alice is in love with the comedically Alpha Chad Bob who's hyper fit and enthusiastic about stuff. They go to the beach/pool to go swimming, and Alice gets hit by a big wave and almost drowns. Bob pulls her out and lays her down on the beach. Alice decides to fake being unconscious to get mouth-to-mouth. So far this is very standard Rom-Com stuff seen a million times. The gag comes when Bob, instead of giving mouth to mouth, goes to break her ribs to pump her lungs like how real CPR works then Alice shoots up in pain.


  Just feels like it'd work very well; faking drowning for CPR is a common trope already, and almost breaking a faker's ribs is funny, educational, and realistic.

    It sounds like you want to see a deconstruction of the rom-com genre and now that I think about how it could play out, I'm really interested in watching something like that too.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      Not a deconstruction, just that one specific gag. Most rom-coms just do something else like an ugly lifeguard doing mouth to mouth instead.
      ```

  - u/Anakiri:
    ```
    I see what you mean and I can see the humor there, but it's not especially realistic. Or rather, the realistic result of this is Bob losing whatever certification he might have and possibly facing assault charges, depending on what the local good samaritan/duty to rescue laws look like. The very first step in real CPR is to to check the patient's pulse and breathing to see if CPR is necessary, to avoid this exact sort of thing.

    On the other hand, some jurisdictions suggest compression-only CPR, especially for people with minimal or outdated training, on the theory that some people are not willing to perform rescue breaths and it is better to do something than nothing. So Alice might be even more the victim of her own ignorance.

    (Also, chest compressions do not pump the patient's lungs, they pump the patient's heart. Hence ***cardio***pulmonary resuscitation.)
    ```

    A male character breaking a female characters ribs seems like it's a bit darker than the format allows.  You also need a bit of a setup for why a girl who's old enough to star in a Rom Com is faking death for a kiss.

    But, if you want to go that way, (and I'm riffing off /u/turtleswamp):

    Alice has decided that she's not getting guys to commit because she's being too much of a "Miranda".  So she makes a commitment to make guys wait, and not go further than a kiss on the first date.

    Fast forward an act, and she's really, really missing any kind of physical contact.  So, she's looking forward to date with a guy, and to dress up for it, borrows a swim suit from a bustier friend.  To make up the difference, she uses silicone inserts in her bra.

    Skip past the date.  ALICE looks sheepish, and friend is trying to grill her for details about the date. 

    FRIEND: "Bob looked great?  Did you get up close and personal?"

    ALICE: "A little..."

    (Flashback to wave crashing over ALICE, and Bob hauling her in.  Camera notes that his hand is on her chest.  She sighs and leans into him as he's swimming)

    FRIEND: "Ok, but you kept the top on, right?"

    ALICE: "Well..."

    (Flashback to ALICE and BOB on shore.  He's shouting, "I didn't feel a pulse!  Grab the defib!". Her top gets torn open and the silicone inserts flop everywhere, in front of the lifeguards.)

    FRIEND: "Ok, fine, maybe you went a bit too far, but was he a good kisser?"

    ALICE: "I don't actually know."

    (Flashback to BOB pulling out a rescue mask)

    ---

    This way, the joke is that Alice has gotten her friends top destroyed, and is letting her friend have a mistaken impression about the date, instead of admitting she faked unconsciousness to get close to a lifeguard.

      It'd be almost. One hard compression than they shoot up in pain. I've mostly been watching anime lately so that's what I think it'd fit most perfectly, but if my memory is correct I think it'd fit well in children's sit coms and cartoons too. I know Gravity Falls had a similar gag except it was the male merman mouth-to-mouthing Dipper and then Mabel made fun of him for getting his first kiss that way.

  I tried to ask this monday, but I was late so no one replied, so attempt #2

  Can anyone rec me novels (pref online) that are centered around management/being a leader/empire building.

  Some novels that exemplify this that I've read; Practical Guide to Evil, Release that Witch, Dungeon Defense, The Girl Who Ate a Death God, The Amber Sword, I Am The Monarch, Dungeon Keeper Ami, Overlord,Tales of the Reincarnated Lord, Common Sense of a Duke's Daughter (too many shoujos to list actually)

  Realist Kingdom was mostly about people being amazed at the MC for doing really unastonishing stuff, but I can see how that could apply to some of the stuff that I listed. The story just really bugged me in a way the other novels didn't, maybe because the side characters were really uninspired/flat

  Slime Tensei was okay, but it was more of an "action" novel more than anything. But I did really like that slow progression of his city.

    > My question is, is there a better way to handle an argument like this?

    I don't know about "better", but I can offer you "different", and then you can try it and see if it works out for you.

    > After saying this I still had to reargue my point several times before he understood and we then moved onto point 2.

    > In the past when using this method, I have been accused of not understanding a problem, or grossly oversimplifying it.

    At this point - after you've given a single explanation and had it rejected - I'd recommend responding with something along the lines of "OK, if I don't understand it, then explain it to me."

    This works on three different fronts:

    - The person with whom you are arguing is preparing his arguments in his head while you talk. His arguments are convincing to him, and so until you're able to answer them (or at least *hear* them) he's less likely to be persuaded by anything you say.
    - Sometimes, when presenting his line of argument, an opposing debater might pause to check his logic and realise that he's made an error. (This is rare, and cannot be relied on, but it is possible.) Even if that does not happen, you will have a far better idea of how he got to his conclusion, and can argue against any holes in his argument.
    - Sometimes, every now and then, the other person is right. Allowing them to present their point of view has a chance of preventing you both wasting your time due to your own error.

    It sounds like you explained your thoughts to your friend in a way that was way too complicated and verbose.

    I would have said "In a isolated system, entropy can only increase. It can increase or decrease in non-isolated systems, but in isolated systems it always increases and that's it" and gone from there.

    On the other hand... I dunno, that sounds about as minor and non-impactful a conversation as it gets, and you say your friend agreed with you in the end, so I don't think there's much for you to optimize here?

  Are there ANY other webserials/fanfiction subreddits that are dedicated to quality webserials/fanfictions like r/rational?

  The only reason I really like this subreddit is because the readers agree with me on what is quality for the most part.

  I like LitRPGs but if you go over to r/litRPGs the discussion is neutered by the prevalence of authors suggesting their own works and also the cut between readers who enjoy Harems and who do not. Some times when you ask for suggestions people will give you Harem builders and tell you its a "good" serial. Sometimes you will explicitly state that you do not want Harems and they will say it is only 'light' on the harem aspects. I am not saying that their is anything wrong with liking harems or anything, just not my thing. 

  Anyway, rant finished, what are other webserial book discussiony subreddits that I can browse through besides r/rational r/litRPG and r/noveltranlations. I tried r/Fantasy but like r/litRPG I always feel like people are trying to sell me their books and not really caring about the discussion and suggestions.

    In my personal experience of 5+ years of digging through light novels, litrpgs, and fanfics, I've found lurking at Sufficient Velocity, Space Battles, RoyalRoadL (I know they dropped the L but I've been a regular there since they were originally translating that light novel), Alternate History, FanFiction, and ArchiveofOurOwn are pretty much there only places you can get fanfictions/webserials of any considerable length.

    Sort by post count/word count and go down the list. Bookmark or follow the ones you like and after a while, you can have your own daily reading list. Mine can sustain me for about 2 or 3 hours every day but it's a constant battle to find reliable authors. Fanfics by their nature have very short half lives with only 2 or 3 lasting more than half a year out of the dozens that pop up every week. Hell, one of my consistent authors I've been following for over 2 years dropped off the internet a couple weeks back. Truly a shame and quite literally irreplaceable.

    Anyone "off the grid" and not found here at /r/rational is practically impossible to find. They're essentially books at that point and a last ditch effort would be digging through goodreads to find fanfictions.

      I know the struggle. Whenever I catch up to the fanfic/novel I am reading I spend countless hours of trying to find something new worth reading mainly on the sites you listed. 

      The quest of finding something new to read is kind of enjoyable due to the endless options those sites have available. But after the third hour of beta reading trash prologue chapters, fanfic after fanfic, you get really angsty and frustrated of not finding anything worthwhile to read so you go to bed early with a headache and your dopamine receptors teased into anger.

      Not feeling tired you open your phone and once again browse /r/rational, hoping one of the fics there updated. But, when you sort the subreddit by new, the latest thread was only some arbitrary request for a fic created about 2 hours ago. You click on the thread anyway hoping for it to pay dividends but you realized that all of the recommendations from other fellow redditors posted on the thread was the stuff you already read and reread multiple times. You came to another realization that you yourself created this thread on your alt account not wanting to be accused of annoyingly spamming the subreddit every hour.

      You are starting to feel helpless and depressed that you couldn't find any good fanfics to read before your self appointed bedtime which is only tolerated as a necessary evil to not feel groggy and dead at your dead-end job. However, it is approaching fast. So you take a deep breath and hopefully try your luck on /r/fanfiction.

      You browse thread after thread on /r/fanfiction and immediately become confused. The only threads you see are people high fiving and patting each other on the back for their first like received on the fanfic they are writing. You felt like you awkwardly walked into an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting.

      You closely look at /r/fanfiction again and there is no threads about the supposed well-written fanfics you are desperately searching for. The only fanfic recommendations you see are countless shoddy self promotions contained in one thread like a quarantine keeping out a biohazard. You instinctively know browsing that thread will be a waste of your precious time of trying to appease your dopamine receptors. You begrudgingly enter the quarantine zone and read one of the fanfics in the thread and your suspicions are correct. It's self promoted garbage so bad that if you throw it away in your designated blue recyclable bin, you will get a letter in the mail the next day billing you for mixing trash with the recyclables. You realized it belonged in that landfill of a thread for a reason.

      You started to remember the reason why you only browse /r/rational to find quality fanfics to read because /r/fanfiction is really no help at all. They are mainly about writing fanfiction and want nothing to do with your quest for dopamine by finding good fanfiction to read. They are an enigma. Reading and discussing quality fanfics are beyond them. You start to think how stupidly inane that is and somewhat ironic.

      Your bedtime finally arrives and you give into the despair. You close your eyes and try to fall asleep just hoping that one of the many dead fanfics you follow miraculously revives. At least thats something to look forward to tomorrow. You set the alarm in your phone but, in an act of petty defiance, you once again check the thread you made on your alt account. Surprisingly someone commented and they recommended a fanfic you haven't read before!

      You get excited instantly but your hopes are not that high after hours and hours of fruitless searching. However, after reading the prologue the fanfic seems extremely promising! The fanfic has over a million words and it can potentially last you weeks!

      You are starting to fiend out reading the first 3 chapters. You are a dopamine fiend and you only obtain dopamine from reading quality fanfiction. The fanfic you are reading is remarkably good. Revolutionary even. You are on the biggest high in your young adult life. The new fanfic you are reading is so good you started to read it more slowly, savoring every word, not wanting it to end forever being cast out in endless limbo of waiting for another updated chapter. You are starting to worship the author of this fanfic, thanking him with all your heart for gracefully writing this masterpiece. He is the shepherd and you are the sheep. You graze on the words of his fanfic and fill your belly with unbridled dopamine. Baa.

      However, after the fourth chapter  something changed. While reading chapter 4 on your dopamine high, you were excited, then confused, then angry. Incomparably angry. You never felt so much anger in your life. The chapter you just read was bad. So bad, it left a disgusting taste in your mouth. You had such high hopes but it was all dashed away because one of the characters did something uncharacteristically. Or was it the major plot hole that was blatantly ignored? Well it was one of your pet peeves but, it was also one of your triggers. You became so triggered in fact, that you decided to write fanfiction yourself not wanting to trust your dopamine needs to other fanfic authors ever again. I mean how hard can it be?

      You are tired. So tired. After 6 hours of brainstorming, editing, and do overs you have done it! You have created your first ever fanfic! In the second hour, the blind rage wore off and you honestly thought that this endeavor was hopeless. Writing fanfiction is way harder than it looks and you wanted to give up halfway through and finally call it a night. You were pleasantly suprised that /r/fanfiction was really helpful in that regard. They rallied to your cause and supported you to the end in answering your every literary question. You find that strangely ironic of them being so helpful but you couldn't figure out why being so tired for staying up for so long. The feeling of peaceful acceptance almost overrides the nagging anxiety of staying up so late. Almost.

      You wake up feeling groggy and dead. You curse yourself, once again falling into the trap of reading your favorite fanfics before going to bed. You realize that the notepad app is running on your phone. After promptly reading what was written on it you hastily delete it in case anyone from work manages to accidentally read it and associate that garbage heap with you.

      There is a skip in your step as you head to work as you noticed that many of your favorite fanfics were updated overnight and you can't wait to read it. You know you are going to get a lot of dopamine tonight and can't wait.

  First of all, thanks to /r/rational for all the great book recommendations and podcasts given the past Friday. For those interested, the thread is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/ajpw1d/d_friday_open_thread/eeyvoxg/).

  -------------------------------------------------------

  What does /r/rational think about [House of Cards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Cards_(U.S._TV_series))? I've watched a bit of it, but I've wondered how rational the actions of the protagonist are. I mean, Frank's strategy starts working pretty well at the beginning, but given that in our current age, information systems ensure there's always some registry of a crime and backstabbings tend to be known by others at a much faster rate thanks to social networks, performing evil acts will give diminishing returns and always will come to bite back unless one gets to own the entire system or construct some design that prevents it from affecting you (like legal defenses).

  Before the internet, dna testing, social networks and pocket videocameras, serial killers and criminals got away scott free due to lack of evidence that could be used against them, but in our current time's, any tweet, message or even private conversation can be monitored, analyzed using data mining and nlp algorithms and judged by thousands of people. It's easier and easier to out corrupt individuals and, even if legally they can still escape, make their crimes known to everyone on a global scale and at a rate that would have been impossible in the age of paper letters and word of mouth messages.

  Do you think there's still merit to Frank's strategy in our current environment? I mean, he achieved too little and was constantly hindered by the people he himself betrayed at the beginning of the series.

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------


  In other notes, who here watches or reads news in the morning? I read that it's a good habit to be up to date on what happens in the world, but, unless it's a specific local event that affects us, we won't really have any way to affect outside events that are far away or that can only be impacted with effort given on a global scale.

  Furthermore, it may affect us negatively by making us feel impotent to change undesirable events and make us feel more pessimistic and inferior towards the world and our situation in general.

  Is there a more productive way to use the news we get daily? I thought, since I'm a member of a Toastmaster's club, to create an improvised speech based on the news I receive in the morning, thus learning of the event, becoming familiar and practicing my improv skills.

  But I wonder if there's something more productive that could be done with that time block and get more benefit from reading the newspaper.

    Mild spoilers, but past the first season Frank frantically doing more unethical acts to cover up past unethical acts become commonplace.

    That said, I think Frank's strategy could be considered rational when you consider his ambitions. He places an incredibly high weight on the goal of "becoming president" and relative low weights on everything else. If a casino offered a special deal "50% chance you become president, 50% chance you go to jail" I think he'd take it. By the beginning of the series, he's already fairly old(I expect 60+) and gotten about as far politically as he could hope without taking radical risks. Likewise, he's been committing immoral acts his whole life and has actually gotten quite far with them- Congress whip of the Democract party.

    >But I wonder if there's something more productive that could be done with that time block and get more benefit from reading the newspaper.

    I think the main benefit to being up to date about the world is that it makes for good conversation. There's a good chance your friends and random strangers are at least mildly affected by world events and stay up to date with them, so you can discuss world events with your friends. World events have a lot of depth to them and don't really run out as a conversation piece. The downside is that disagreements can create major rifts in friendships, but you can always just avoid discussing politics with people you disagree with politically.

    Note: I've only seen a few episodes, but I've watched the whole UK series.

    Frank illustrates instrumental rationality, he wants to achieve his goals: power, prestige and legacy. He has a Machiavellian view of power. He never updates his beliefs (so he fails at epistemic rationality). In his views cooperation is only possible if people have the same goals as him (which is impossible, because most people don't care as much about Frank Underwood as he does). As a result, politics is war. Everything is an attack.

    This. Just as an addendum, this is one of the reasons why crime still exist. Natural selection allowed criminals to exist because their strategies were viable. Now things are different, but nature didn't have the time to catch up to it yet.

      Conversely, do you think it would be possible to bypass these limitations?

      I thought of a few:

      * Drowning a call for action or a criminal video in a sea of information, using shock tactics to divert the attention of others from important topics towards utterly irrelevant ones. I think this one is already practiced by the media sometimes.

      * Building fake videos/evidence to further cloud test results. This would be very time consuming and difficult due to the variety of tech we got. Like falsifying video, dna tests, and other data. Not to mention beating a highly reputable institute specializing in tests is not easy.

  Do you have any short, pithy observations or principles for living/value statements that you consider worth sharing? I keep a commonplace book in the form of Notepad++ and about 140 different text files opened, and I started a collection of that sort of thing a while back.

  I'm not taking about quotes, by the way (unless you're quoting yourself, that is). We all have google.

    Here is a list past-me made (translated, so the wording is a bit awkward):

    * When you understand, you cannot understand how others do not understand.
    * There is no difference between zero and something slightly greater than zero in practice.
    * If you cannot differentiate between two things, they are equal.
    * Most statements are either trivial or false.
    * The concept of someone being at fault is irrelevant. Sanctions are for optimising the Nash Equilibrium.
    * Authority is a heuristic.
    * You should not rate decisions by their consequences.
    * Difficulty is a combination of memorisation and understanding.
    * You should not justify expenses after they have been made.
    * A level-2 strategy does not always win against a level-1 strategy.

  Does anyone know if there's any rationalist alt-history fiction out there? I find it a very fascinating idea, if well done, and even better if it digs into very geeky, not well known aspects of history rather than the really obvious ones, using turning points that were genuinely small random events that could have gone either way but had momentous effects (so more "What if Frederick Barbarossa had not drowned while swimming in a river on his way to the Crusade?" and less "What if the Nazis had won WW2?").

  I'm also trying to write a different kind of historical fiction right now - Harry Potter historical fanfiction, exploring the way the magical world worked and changed in parallel with the history we know of. I'm not sure if something like that would belong in here, but if it sounds like something you'd enjoy, I can let you know here when it's out.

    I think I would enjoy that fanfiction.

    Sounds like something I would like. I'm super into alt history (and historical fiction in general), and if that can get crossed with sci-fi or fantasy, all the better.
