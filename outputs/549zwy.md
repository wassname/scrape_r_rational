## [RT] Thanks to this community, I refined my (somewhat) rational, first book!

### Post:

And now my first book is published!  https://www.amazon.com/Delvers-LLC-Welcome-Blaise-Corvin-ebook/dp/B01M0U4B3S/

Is it perfect?  No.  But I got some great feedback from this community way back here:  https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4o2a4a/rt_delvers_llc_litrpg_that_attempts_to_make/

I want to thank some of the folks at /r/rational for reading my story and giving great input.

Thank you!
