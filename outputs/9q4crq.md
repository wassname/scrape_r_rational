  Your characterizations continue to impress! 

  Pyrrha was apparently trained to repress things until they go away. Kinda like the "turn it off" song from Book of Mormon. I guess it works since Mistral hasn't been overrun, but it seems a little unhealthy from my perspective. 

  Weiss freaks the fuck out as soon as a giant Grimm shows up and loses her ability to stay calm and dispassionate because she's faced with something her training hasn't covered. Does a good job portraying how she's extremely inexperienced when it comes to live-fire situations. Also does well showing how you can read and memorize all the social interaction books you want, but putting them into practice while under stress is a lot harder.

  Also, Pyrrha's semblance is really really unfair.

  One of the stories I most look forward to updates from! Best RWBY fic Iâ€™ve read by far. 

  Your treatment of the Grimm, and the effect their attraction to negative emotions has on both the central characters and the world at large, is top-notch.

  It reminds me of the way Alexander Wales thinks and writes in his Worth the Candle serial.

    High praise!  I'm glad you're enjoying it so far \^.^

  I really want to find out precisely what Weiss was going to say before she cut herself off, but maybe that'd ruin the comedic effect.

  Oh Jaune. You are having the *most awkward* harem right now.  
  Though you are good for them, mostly. The soft and compassionate boy, with a fair bit of insight. That youngest sister really did remind me of Ruby, with her happy dedication to the craft, contrasted to unease with social gatherings.  

  Here's hoping Jaune will (eventually) either resolve this teenage drama of build an even bigger web of connections.

  Huh, no idea why I've never checked this one out before. Pretty good stuff, Ruby is really sympathetic, and the fleshing out of the setting and fantasy mechanics are deeply appreciated.
  ```

- u/CoronaPollentia:
  ```
  Question: How does Remnant have PhDs when it seems to have a totally diffent academic culture than Earth? It didn't really throw me off, but it definitely stood out as a "I should probably accept this as one of those things where an author translates a character's personal culturally-bound concept into an closely-mapped real-world idea.

  Also, the line was great, and got a chuckle out of me.
  ```

  - u/tjhance:
    ```
    actually, there are PhDs in canon, too. Dr. Oobleck specifically mentions having one.
    ```

    - u/CoronaPollentia:
      ```
      Huh. Fair enough. I wonder if there's a whole academic system totally separate from the Hunter-centric system? I guess there must be.
      ```

      - u/jetztf:
        ```
        I'm pretty sure hunters are very rare when compared to the total population, and someone has to be designing those crazy airships. So I'm pretty sure there's some kinda higher education going on.
        ```

        - u/tjhance:
          ```
          right, not to mention all the 'color hypothesis' research that ruby mentions in chapter 2
          ```

          - u/CoronaPollentia:
            ```
            An academic system is not necessarily the same as a research system, though. Academics implies that it's an education/research system, but you can have, for example, corporate research institutions that are separate from the academics.
            ```
