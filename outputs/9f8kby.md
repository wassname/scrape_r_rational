## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  I'm not sure if this fits best in worldbuilding but the thread is empty so you know I can play fast and loose with the rules?

  Anyway, a lot of stories are about characters undergoing Personal Growth and Learning A Lesson About Being A Good Person, and other such things like that. 

  I re-read *The Giver* about 5 years ago and I was shocked at how over the top it was: the second Jonas finds out the Evil Truth Of The World, he states in a transparently expositional way why that's bad and stuff. Sure, fine, he's a kid. But the eponymous Giver, upon hearing Jonas's outrage, suddenly goes, "oh yeah, my dystopian society is actually terrible, I am now down with you breaking all our most sacred laws". It doesn't feel like the Giver "earned" his epiphany: he hears that the world is bad and accepts it unquestioningly. He only offers minimal, perfunctory resistance to Fixing The World, and gives up on defending the dystopia pretty much immediately, when someone as aged as the Giver would be probably Set In His Ways; not to mention his personal history means that he has seen first-hand the benefits of the dystopia. 

  So, in rational fiction, how do you make characters earn their epiphanies? How do you make growth, where they change their most central opinions of the world, feel *natural*? 

  (I'm not specifically interested in *The Giver*, it's just the first "bad example" I can think of.)

      Regarding >!the death of rosemary !<, how it actually happened was different than you seem to remember: >!she was traumatised from receiving memories of war and death and pain, and so asked to "Be Released", and when she realised that it was death by lethal injection, she asked to inject herself. She seemed complicit in her own suicide. And then her memories somehow leaked out of her brain and into everyone else when she died, so the normal town folk were traumatised by the horrible memories and The Giver had to counsel them. So, putting myself in The Giver's shoes, he's holding memories that are so bad they drove his daughter to suicide, and if Jonas succeeds in his plan, he gives the townsfolk so many memories that they won't be able to "just get over them" like they did with Rosemary's memories which were much fewer. Like, I don't see the Giver being an actual enthusiastic participant in this plan without a lot of planning and reassurance, and I didn't feel like he earned it in the story !<

      So yeah, that's how I feel about it. 

      I think your example is on the money: the character needs to be shown to be slowly working towards it, inciting incidents need to be shown, and so on.

          Geez, looking for references in the original material? I can't compete with that!

          It's strange that it seems much better thought out than I remember it being, perhaps it's because you only saw Jonas's point of view so you didn't really get to see the Giver's thought process in much detail. Or maybe my memory's bad, but I definitely was vaguely appalled at how simplistically the moral component of the story was written.

          > the main character responds by going to sleep, and lashing out at anyone who talks to him. It requires the combined effort of many people over many days just to get him back out of his bed.

          I don't really remember this. Is this when >!Ender is upset that they're rigging the game against him?!<? 

          Gotta admit that unlike apparently everyone else in this subreddit I didn't "get" Ender's game, but I've been told you need to read it in your teens to really get it, and being an adult doesn't let you relate to Ender in the same way.

  so, i had an idea for a pathfinder setting. 

  basic concept, in the first age the kobold sorcerers became the world power, and through transkoboldism some of them became dragons. they created some transhuman servants (orcs and elves) as well. then came a war that ended their civilization, and left their towers of arcane power in ruin... and the dungeons are either fallout vaults to survive the magical apocalypse that used many powerful magical creatures, or military bases hidden underground to avoid scrying (including R&D labs to make more magical creatures). 

  this creates a wonderful setting for human heroes, to explore the lost ruins of a past civilization. and it also explains a lot of the nonsense in some dungeons- there was a war, and the ones making a lot of the old magic were a different species/culture. 

  this is the post-apocalyptic wasteland where dragons are few, kobolds are weak and hunted, and the great cities are now only ruins lost to time... and slowly, the humans are killing the remaining dragons faster than they breed. the old ways have been lost save for a few ancient dragon scholars, and the 5-headed postkobold dragon god, Tiamat, who is still angry that her civilization lost a major war. weapons left behind from the war range from owlbears and basalisks, to the tarrasque. it was a tippyverse of kobolds that fell to an apocalypse somehow. 

  and then we can add in a few things like infohazards... the feeblemind scroll is designed to destroy non-kobold minds that try to read that information. most deadly magical traps wont target a kobold (or transkobold such as a dragon), except for those in military instilations. 

  the war ended when non-kobold slave races somehow attained gods of their own, and many of the kobold civilizations gods were slain, driven insane, or imprisoned. and from there, civilization slowly began to recover as points of light....
