  Patience pays off! Thanks for the Chapter.

  I liked the interactions a lot, especially the second one with the parents.
  The reactions all  felt very human.

  So Rose isn't really the kind of character that can be a waifu (most importantly because she's seven, far less importantly because she's an alien lizard), but I do think she very solidly fits the "daughteru" mold, what with her cute mannerisms and awkward reptilian smile than needs to be protected.

  Sorry, this comment doesn't actually have anything to do with this chapter specifically, I just thought it needed to be said.

  Thank you so much for the chapter, I've been looking forward to it!

  I don't trust this creature, nor its puppets.  Listen to your parents, girl!
