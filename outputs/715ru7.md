  At first I wondered how exactly is that premise in any way rational.

  After a couple chapters, it's pretty damn fitting in this sub. It feels almost *uncannily* like HPMoR.

  * We have openly Machiavellian yet emotionally close mentor who's not *quite* a villain. 

  * There's our young heroine, rational, intelligent and wise in matters both magical and mundane. 

  * Of course there are... best metaphor I have is practice strawman, so the author can show you how to shoot down their ignorance. (Shining...) 

  * And there's the indignation and fury on stupidities of the current society and establishment.

  * Ah also anger is something of a significant emotion for her, just to add to the comparison pile.

    "Practice strawman" seems like a legit phrase. I mean, learning to shoot bows at humans? Make a man out of straw.
    ```

  - u/Flashbunny:
    ```
    I would note it's not just "practice strawmen" they go up against - Celestia seems pretty intelligent.
    ```

    - u/PurposefulZephyr:

      Well, not everyone is a (practice) dummy, I'll give you that. 

      But the thing is- rational fiction often boasts about having... not even smart, but thinking characters.

      So, Shining Armor: he's a high ranking officer, a natural spellcaster, and a guard. He isn't smart, but he's no idiot. When this guy decides that learning more *defensive* spells to do his job does not have a point, then I call bull. I mean, his *special talent* is magical defense!

      Point is- he didn't have a reason to be this dumb, not outside of showing off the lesson our amazing heroine thought of.
      ```

      - u/Flashbunny:
        ```
        Oh, sure. It's not completely rational by that metric - I'm just pointing out that there's large parts of it users of this sub *will* like, even if it's not 10/10 throughout.

  Can anyone who has read this give me a description? Doesn't have to be long, it's just that fimfiction is so annoying to navigate.

    Form the page:

        Twilight Sparkle has too much magic, and it will take her decades to learn to control it. Her spectacular loss of control during her entrance exam only proves that fact. She is a danger to herself and others.

        After Sunset Shimmer’s disappearance, Princess Celestia needs a new student to bear The Element of Magic to defeat Nightmare Moon. With all of Equestria at stake, Twilight Sparkle…is not the pony she needs.

        Princess Celestia seals Twilight Sparkle’s magic with the distant promise of one day teaching her.

        But there are two diarchs of Equestria. Amidst a lucid dream, an offer is made.

        “Hello, Twilight. Would you like to be my student?”

    Twilight (for plot reasons) fails to qualify for her apprenticeship with Celestia, and instead is taken in by Luna, who she meets in her dreams. Luna is somewhat bitter about being locked in the moon by her sister, and spreads her animosity toward Celestia to Twilight.

    It's a pretty good story. I'm glad it has finally finished, it seemed abandoned for the past year.


    Here's a teaser - somewhat of a minor running joke, that Twilight doesn't understand how Pinkie Pie manages to do what she does:



    “How about this?” I brought a forehoof up and went through the usual motions. “I promise not to strand you away from Canterlot. Cross my heart, hope to fly, stick a cupcake in my eye.”

    Shining raised an eyebrow and flatly asked, “What was that?” He was clearly unimpressed with my attempt to reassure him.

    “A Pinkie Promise,” I answered. Seeing as that wasn’t actually an answer, I added, “Pinkie Pie is a time mage. I think. She takes promises very seriously, so it’s best not to break ones made in her name.”

    Shining just looked at me like I was crazy, which I could hardly blame him for.

    “Here, watch this.” I cleared my throat, just because it seemed appropriate for the demonstration. “I promised I wouldn’t abduct you. I think, deep down, you still trust me. If I broke my promise, I’d lose that trust. And losing a friend’s trust is the fastest way to lose a friend.”

    It didn’t even take a second before Pinkie Pie popped out of nowhere from behind the front counter. Joe behind it looked as though he’d wet himself from the surprise.

    “Forever!” Pinkie Pie said.

    Shining started and whipped his head about to face her. He watched her slowly disappear behind the counter again in her own overly dramatic way.

    After several seconds worth of silence in the entire restaurant, Shining turned back to face Twinkleshine and me.

    “Ha ha. You got me. I didn’t–”

    “No,” I interrupted. “It’s not a trick. Scry the area, if you must. She’s gone.”

    “Wha…”

    Horn alight, Shining took my advice and searched the store for Pinkie Pie, but obviously didn’t find her. There hadn’t been any obvious magic use, either, so unless he concluded this was a very elaborate hoax, he’d have to believe.

    Shining hesitated, but he asked, “Is that replicable?”

  Okay, I pulled an all-nighter and read the whole story. Ugh. I do not recommend it. I feel like I've just lost 2d6 sanity points; I feel as shitty as the time I read the second half of Worm in four days.

  ---

  All right, so mostly spoiler-free review: this is the most HP:MoR story I've ever read. Like, this is ten times more HP:MoR than HP:MoR.

  My summary would be "Imagine if someone took the Azkaban arc from MoR, made an entire decade-spanning story around it, and added some slice-of-life and more Harry-Quirrell interaction".

  Overall, I don't know quite what to think; the first few chapters are pretty rough, but then it becomes... well, not "better", but more focused. The whole thing is extremely bitter and depressing; it's basically the story of a broken extremely talented girl with toxic influences destroying herself and lashing at the people around her, keeping herself miserable and acquiring unfathomable amounts of power... yeah, this is exactly like Worm's second half. And just like Worm, I felt like I was hurting myself reading this, but I still couldn't stop.

  Ultimately, the ending felt pretty disappointing. Twilight never finishes reading Celestia's letter, which was the main thing I wanted resolved (what was Celestia thinking?). Without spoiling too much, the final status-quo is surprisingly non-bleak, and Equestria isn't reduced to a giant crater; but the psychological part feels like a tragedy. Twilight has learned a lot, become a better friend, and reached immense power... but it all feels empty. She's still as bitter as ever, she still hasn't seriously confronted Luna about all the horrible things she did to her for ultimately selfish reasons, she still hasn't realized how unhealthy their relationship is, she obviously hasn't found satisfaction, and still hasn't let go of her resentment towards Celestia. She has some growing positive relationships, but it's still depressing.

  This feels like Worm if Worm had ended without the Taylor chapter, or Pact if Pact had ended without the motorcycle epilogue. Something's missing. I would really, really have liked a "10 years later" epilogue where Twilight finished reading Celestia's letter, and just... showed some signs that she was ready to move past her issues. As it stands, I can imagine it happening... but it's ambiguous. The author saying that an epilogue would be "fluff, randomly depressing, mindless violence" doesn't help.

  So yeah. I am sadness.

  Anyway, I am super tired. All nighters aren't my thing. Ugghghgghgh.

  (also the parts that talked about relationship and sex felt very awkward; and I *do not* approve of the Twilight-Luna pairing, but that's minor)
  ```

  - u/Bowbreaker:
    ```
    Funny thing is that I liked all of Worm (except for the time skips) and that the Azkaban arc may have been my favorite part of the story (just like it was for Eniasz Brodski who made the audiobook version) *and* that the motorbike epilogue from Pact didn't really do anything for me.

    I'm still not sure if I'm going to read this but your ostensibly negative review definitely didn't lower the chance that I will.

  - u/Nighzmarquls:

    I find this response interesting. 

    I've not gone back and reread it but everyone involved seemed within range of human norm or better.

    That crossed with the story of whose perspective this story is from gave me the view that given this particular batch of characters I'm hard pressed to see the whole thing unfolding much better. 

    I suppose you could want it to be better but that would involve changing a lot of personalities.
    ```

    - u/CouteauBleu:
      ```
      Oh yeah. The story definitely makes sense, and I see how the dynamics it depicts are realistic, but I still don't like it. It's a story about broken characters suffering because of their own flaws, and... well, that's not really my thing? That's why I'm making the Worm comparisons.

      Although I could see ways in which the events could unfold more positively. If Celestia had been more convincing, if Twilight's friends had confronted her about her flaws more often, if Shining Armor or Cadence had argued better why following Luna might be a bad idea, etc...

      The story is pretty open-ended. I could see any of these things happen over the years, as Twilight opens up to her friends and gets more perspective on both her actions and Celestia's motives, etc. Like Twilight said, they have eternal life; they'll move on sooner or later.
      ```

- u/CouteauBleu:
  ```
  Here's another datapoint from my experience:

  I've two chapters so far, and I don't feel like reading more. I really like the general concept ("protagonist is mentored by a supervillain" is always a cool concept), but I found it awkwardly executed.

  I don't really have words to describe it. It's fanfiction-ish; it reads like the most awkward parts of HP:MoR; I think I would boil it down to "This is not how Wildbow would write this story".

  I don't know if that makes sense? Point is, if you were put off my the most cringy parts of HP:MoR, this will put you off even more. If you saw nothing wrong with HP:MoR, you will probably love this story.

  ---

  That's the general critique; now, to the fic's credit, the plot does seem interesting; but I don't really like the direction it seems to go into; (MILD SPOILERS AHEAD)

  The whole "Celestia neglects Twilight" plot feels very forced, in a bad way. This isn't a minor detail, this is the story's entire premise. I feel like there's a thousand things Celestia could, and would have tried, before giving up on Twilight. Even if she didn't have time to mentor Twilight full-time, she could arrange to give her private lessons on week-ends. She could have Cadence teach her part-time. This is especially important since we're told that Celestia is desperately looking for a Chosen One against Luna; she should probably spend at least a few days/weeks tutoring Twilight, getting a sense of her potential before discarding her a dead-end.

  And I know the story is trying to justify why Twilight would develop resentment for Celestia and gratitude for Luna, but this is way too sudden. I feel like the story would work better if the first few chapters were about Celestia trying to teach Twilight, then growing more distant as it becomes apparent Twilight won't be able to get her powers under control in time to fight Nightmare Moon, with Twilight feeling cheated as Celestia starts neglecting her and looking for other Chosen Ones.

  It would also be an occasion to have "two sides to every story" conflicts where Twilight has to ponder how much she trusts what Luna tells her vs what Celestia tells her, keeping in mind that she has reasons to distrust both.

    Having read it myself, your issues with the plot are explained.... Eventually.

    It's definitely awkward in spots but there aren't any characters doing obviously stupid things from their perspective (though we often don't get that perspective until much later)
    ```

  - u/Flashbunny:
    ```
    Those are absolutely reasonable concerns and they're addressed/resolved later on, but without giving away important plot points I can't tell you how.
