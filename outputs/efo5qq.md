## [HSF][HF][TH]Onward to Providence: Sci-Fi-Fantasy Space Opera

### Post:

Really far too much has been happening since last I posted, so I'm just going to reintroduce the story.  


Onward to Providence is a story about alien beings in a alternative physics universe dealing with life and what comes of it.  


Every update is illustrated and It's been praised by my dozen or so readers so far for its alien perspectives, sensible world building and the various mysteries and reveals that have come along as the story has unfolded.  


If that sounds up your alley then please check it out, there are 290k words so far and tons of illustrations to enjoy. Updates are semi-daily but will usually settle back into twice a week after new years.

  Is there any place where this story is published that is less... *forum-y*? I find these very uncomfortable to read, especially on the phone. I think this was what stopped me from progressing through the story the first time I stumbled upon it.

  Thanks in advance!

    How do you mean? SV and SB have reader modes that strip out the non-threadmarked content so you're left with only the story
    ```

      ```
      They both have a header on my phone that takes a good 1/8th of the screen. The spacing from sides is smaller compared to AO3 or e-books. Reader mode that strips non-threadmarked content doesn't remember where I stopped reading, as everything is on one page. These might seem like extremely petty nitpicks, but they tend to build up.

        Fanficfare is a plugin for calibre that can download fanfic from a bunch of different sites, including SB and SV. It automatically grabs the reader mode link, if one exists, and turns it into an epub.

          Thank you, it's just the thing I need!

            Calibre companion is an Android app that pairs wonderfully with calibre, and moon reader pro is the best text reader app I've ever seen.

              Does that handle images in the epub? If not I'd be worried you roll miss some of the stuff the story does.
              ```

                By default, yes.
                ```

  ```
  How would you describe the difference in followers, comments and general atmosphere between the two threads on SB and SV? Overall I prefer the SV community, but every story and quest has its own subculture and SB is frequently more lively and well populated.
