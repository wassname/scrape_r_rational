  Ooh, clever. I'd like to learn more of the Tall Ones.

    Thanks for taking the time to read it. This is my attempt at a web serial. Its just too much fun to mix science and fantasy :-)

  I wonder how much off the time skip is from the modern definition of an hour. 

  Did they build this when the world had a revolution in 12 hours or 23 hours?
  ```

  - u/VanPeer:
    ```
    Interesting thought. One hour is the approximate increment that the protagonist perceives that I picked artbitrarily, so, yes, that would be a 'modern' hour. This is a secondary world, modeled loosely on South Asia. I had imagined the ruins to be 50 million years old, based on old estimate for the Himalayas. 
    [Earth's rotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_rotation) slows  at a rate of 1.7 milliseconds per kilo year. So a day would have been shorter by only a quarter of an hour when the Time Conduit was built.

  ```
  Wonderful story. Very creative physics and monster.
  ```

- u/Abpraestigio:
  ```
  I find the fact that the second word of the first sentence is already spelled incorrectly to be incredibly off-putting.

  I know it's petty, but seeing something like that saps all of my hope that I'm about to read something good.
  ```

  - u/VanPeer:
    ```
    Thank you (I corrected it.).
    You are not being petty. I feel the same way when I see spelling or grammatical errors in a literary work. Having smirked at similar errors in the work of others', I should hold myself to a higher standard. I appreciate the honest feedback, and up voted your comment.
