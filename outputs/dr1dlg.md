If you're at all regular on r/r, you've probably encountered a notice like this already, but PB is a high fantasy serial about life in a cursed otherworldly Mesopotamia.  First installment is [right here](https://pyrebound.wordpress.com/2019/01/17/one-a-child-of-the-hearth/).

  Just out of curiosity, what's everybody's impression of Piridur thus far?  Like, dislike, indifferent, implausible?

    I have a real hard time deciding how much I believe him. That’s not a writing problem, just a consequence of the lack of knowledge we have about the Ensi system and the mutual distrust between them.

    I’m inclined to think the Lugals are making the best of a bad situation — the Ensis genuinely are erratic and need to be controlled. Does suck for Ram, though.

        I'd say it seems like the Lugals are making the best of a bad situation but they are also monarchist nobility who obviously don't give two shits about normal people.  It seems a little different from historical nobility in that they are facing off against extinction level threats which makes their rule slightly more defensible, but still they obviously aren't following any value system or philosophy of government we'd consider valid.  Ram seems to be set up to be a sort of peasant/upper-class revolutionary?

  I'm on 1.4 right when the MC decides he's leaving. I'm assuming it gets better right?
  ```

    Yeah, it does get better. The character progression is a little more erratic than, say, a story by AW or EE, but that has more to do with this being the author's first major story than anything else. Also, some of it is because the main character starts out pretty much completely in the dark about what is going on, and with such a unique setting it leaves the readers in the dark for a long while as well  


    But it does improve. 9 arcs in and I'm still reading it when it comes out, so... yeah :)

      I can guess who EE is, but who’s AW?
      ```

      - u/RedSheepCole:
        ```
        Alexander Wales, I assume.
        ```

      - u/TrebarTilonai:
        ```
        Correct. EE is ErraticEctetera, the author of Practical Guide to Evil.  
        AW is AlexanderWales AKA CthuluRaeJepsen who has written several pieces for the genre. Currently writing Worth the Candle
        ```

          Also, the guy running this Reddit.
          ```

    ```
    It definitely improves
    ```
