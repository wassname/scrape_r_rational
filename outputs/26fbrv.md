    Exploitation!  Unemployment!

    Privatized profits and socialized costs!

      *And* you know what to say the next time someone makes a peep about the real as opposed to the nominal nature of recessions...right?

        Now if only people would start to make peeps like that.. ._. 

        > Story is good less economy lesson please

        No, nope, no – don't you dare.

        Ridiculously educational and entertaining gems are well, ridiculously rare. Ponies + Economics is <3 therefore, moar Economy lessons with Ponies :P

          I will pay him money *not* to make the chaos-god a central bank.  Damn dirty anti-empiricist Austrians...

          EDIT: This remark retracted upon finding out that the central bank is actually run by the Diarchy.
