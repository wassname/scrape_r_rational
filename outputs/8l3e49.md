## Looking for Recommendations similar to what I've read

### Post:

Recently got into web-fiction/serials.  I am obsessed with The Wandering Inn, and recently was turned on to Worth The Candle and burned through it in less than two days (obviously a big fan).  I am a Patreon supporter of both authors now, but I am looking for other works that are similar.  I am very new to this type of reading, and was turned on to this subreddit by the Worth the Candle posts.  Any recommendations for me?  I don't even know where to start.  Thanks.

  Well, Alexander Wales is the non-pseudonym pseudonym of the person who wrote *Worth the Candle,* so you might want to check out his other original web serials, like *Shadows of the Limelight,* or rational fanfiction, like *Branches on the Tree of Time*, or *Metropolitan Man*, which are fics of Terminator and Superman respectively.

  By other authors, rational fanfics I really enjoy include *Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality,* or if you're an Animorphs fan, *Animorphs: The Reckoning* is great. If you like Pokemon, my own story *Pokemon: the Origin of Species* is also fairly popular around here.

  For non-fanfic, *A Practical Guide to Evil* is an amazing classic fantasy series, and *Worm* (or Parahumans) is an incredibly good and long superhero series.

  Sorry for no links, on mobile. You can find them and a bunch of other really good stories in our sidebar links :) Welcome to the community!

    Don't forget Wales' [The Dark Wizard of Donkerk](http://www.alexanderwales.com/darkWizardNaNo2016.html), which has some interesting magic systems that would fit perfectly in WTC. Also a pretty great story in its own right.

      Blegh, I've been meaning to get around to rewriting/finishing that forever, and it's looking increasingly unlikely that's going to happen. I've updated the formatting just now, as that was a common complaint, and added a disclaimer/explanation. (If you for some reason prefer the old formatting, [the old version is here](http://www.alexanderwales.com/darkWizardNaNo2016_old.html).)

    For a world of superheroes, somewhat like Worm but without the grimdark, there's The Fall of Doc Future and sequels.

    MoL is indeed a great read, and perhaps more closely fits the stories the OP cited, with the protagonist developing skills (albeit without a Sudden Game Interface) in a fantasy world.

    If you *like* the game interface, then The Games We Play is a classic of that genre. Also Harry Potter and the Natural 20, which is hilarious if you take even a casual interest in D&D, but is incomplete rather than serial.

    And don't forget the recursive fics of HPMoR. Significant Digits is probably the biggest sequel, and Following the Phoenix was a pretty decent AU.

  You should look into savage divinity, worm and all of its fanfiction, and hpmor

  You know, I was following and enjoying The Wandering Inn, then took a short break, came back to see that there were six straight chapters about Flos, King of Hype, and gave up.

  [Plus](#s " Toren turned evil") and that made me sad :(

  Opinions vary on the rationality level of With This Ring, but if you enjoy it, you'll never lack reading material, because it updates over a thousand words *every day*. And has done for five years, with about another 15-20 to go. Over 2 million words and counting.

  Summary: An author self-insert enters the Young Justice universe, carrying the author's (extensive) general knowledge of DC comics, but having forgotten all about Young Justice itself - and wearing an orange power ring, fuelled by avarice. Superheroing, technological uplift, friendship and utilitarianism ensue. Also contains an alternate "what if he arrived just after a really bad day at work" Renegade timeline, initially just a few alternate chapters but developing into a full-blown second story, with different allies, power sets, personality, and thoroughly butterflied events. Prior canon knowledge may add to the reading experience, but is not required.

  So I started Mother of Learning based on the recommendations here and others.  Wow. Now I'm caught up and kind of sad I didn't wait until it was finished because it is so good.  

  I'll be honest, I tried Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality and while I liked it at first, I couldn't really get into it.  

  Aside from those two, I think I might check out the pokemon one next.  Still looking for more recommendations as it seems to be relatively spread out (as in many recommendations on MoL and HPMoR but only one-offs on most of the others).
