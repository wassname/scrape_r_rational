  The mental image of Reagan melting in the rain is one I'll keep for a long time to come.

  >New Country

  I wonder if every other country name had already been taken at this point. 

  >Vatican Crater

  That's ominous 

  >the Israel-Palestine Anomaly

  This one really cracked me up.

  >THE REAL

  Wtf?

    Could be related to The Matrix:

    > Welcome to the desert of the real.

    The line became the title of a Marxist book, and [the Wikipedia page for the book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welcome_to_the_Desert_of_the_Real) says that it refers to a quote from *Simulacra and Simulation*:

    > If once we were able to view the Borges fable in which the cartographers of the Empire draw up a map so detailed that it ends up covering the territory exactly [...] this fable has now come full circle for us, and possesses nothing but the discrete charm of second-order simulacrum [...] It is the real, and not the map, whose vestiges persist here and there in the deserts that are no longer those of the Empire, but ours. The desert of the real itself.

    Which is indeed ominous.

  There are surprisingly few eighties and nineties in this chapter.  

  I see a 538 (BC, in the epigraph), a 19 (th century, with Phineas Gage), a 3 (days that the mud is available for viewing), 50 (countries in UNSONG), 100's (of dollars for a Name), 250 (pages in The Temple and the Marketplace), 5 and 11 (chapter and verse in Job), 3 (recounts), 20 (electoral votes), 100,000,000,000 (chance of coincidence (ignoring TINACBNIEAC)), and 40 and 4 (Chapter and verse in Isiah).

  In fact the *only* numbers in the chapter between 80 and 99 (inclusive) are the years that the events are taking place in.  This is not a coincidence because nothing is ever a coincidence.

    Maybe the letter 8 was broken?

  ```
  For some reason, my friends don't appreciate these puns, especially this chapter opener. I dunno, I thought it was great.

    ```
    Don't worry, everything whale be alright.
