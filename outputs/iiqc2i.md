## [almost completely unrelated to the topic of the sub] where is the 'real' r/rational?

  The Friday open threads could be what you're looking for, you can discuss anything in them and get feedback from members of this community. You could also head on over to lesswrong like the other commenter suggested, which has a greater focus on thinking rationality.

  [lesswrong.com](https://lesswrong.com) is one of the homes of rationalists on the internet

    If you're looking for more general principles of thinking and acting rationally, rather than any specific question you'd like answered, I'd recommend the Sequences [on the same website](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Sequences) (Or its compilation in [book form](https://intelligence.org/rationality-ai-zombies/), which can be downloaded on a pay-what-you-want-basis).

  /r/slatestarcodex is probably your best bet.

  Are you looking for scientifically accurate and useful advice, or are you looking for rationalism-oriented advice, or what?

  Don't worry about it.  This subreddit is a book club for ratfics and associated stories, and while the sub isn't bereft of general rationalist discussion I don't consider it a slight against us to recognize that that's not the core of this subreddit.

    I don't think there is an "us" to slight. At least I'd hope not. No tribes needed here

  In general I think there isn't a single subreddit which you can rely for advice about all sorts of topics.  I would recommend a subreddit that flairs and verifies experts in specific topics, like for science, /r/askscience.  Lesswrong often attempts to substitute an expert knowledge base and years of studying with basic reasoning and bayesian statistics, and that approach is shallow at best and give deeply misleading answers at worse.  If you just want to have fun talking about a topic with people that like thinking, that's one thing, but if you are looking for genuinely right answers, that's another.

  I've seen two recommendations for r/slatestarcodex... but I've gradually been turned off from it, as the way it allows people to express any view so long as they obey rules about charitably and citing sources has allowed the alt-right to use it as a starting point in a pipeline.  It may have gotten better since the culture war open threads were discontinued, but the spin-off subreddit, themotte, aimed at continuing the sort of discussion the culture war threads had has gotten even worse with full-on mask-off 14 words (rephrased into thousands of words with multiple citations to obey the rules).  themotte also claims to allow any discussion and be neutral, but the moderation is much stricter with mainstream leftist positions and soft on hardcore White Nationalists positions.

  As for the blog slatestarcodex itself... Scott Alexander claims to charitably search through multiple sources and to be a left-leaning centrist... but there is a systematic pattern where he fails to grok basic leftist principles and his attempts at reading leftist material fails in a way that misses the point, while right-wing material gets a much more charitable reading.  I am not sure if he is naive, or Dunning-Krugering himself, or unaware of his own biases, or if he is outright hiding his power level, but it is something to keep in mind when reading from his blog.   The overall effect is that the Overton window of slatestarcodex is dragged to the right even as Scott Alexander insists that he is center left.  

  For a clear example of this, Scott wrote a piece (prior to the 2016 election I think?) about how Donald Trump isn't really any more racist or worse than the average Republican and the people who are warning about his racism and fascism are "crying wolf".  The whole piece is weird for partially acknowledging how racist Republicans are but for the most part serving to try to say Trump isn't that bad.  So it acknowledged Trump was bad but overall tried to normalize Trump, so it was heavily liked by Trump supporters even if Scott managed to avoid being "pro-Trump" per se.  It was a weird angle to come from and it really made me question what motivates Scott to write a given post (and thus suspicions about him hiding his power level).  And Scott has commented on some of his older posts before but never to my knowledge recanted on that post so yeah...

    Scott Alexander is about as alt-right as Richard Dawkins is religious.

    > For a clear example of this, Scott wrote a piece (prior to the 2016 election I think?) about how Donald Trump isn't really any more racist or worse than the average Republican and the people who are warning about his racism and fascism are "crying wolf". 

    "You Are Still Crying Wolf" is from after the election. You might be curious to note some of the comments that he's added to the top of it since then. [Here's the link.](https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/11/16/you-are-still-crying-wolf/)

    What's more, a whole bunch of that essay is basically saying "Actual alt-right and white-supremacists are few in number and almost insignificantly politically weak. People like me — a left-leaning Jewish atheist in the Bay Area, so nominally a political, racial, religious, and sectional foe of these people — don't really have much to fear from them. Please stop scaring my patients; they have enough anxiety already."

    (I thought at the time that he was wrong about Trump, but right about the KKK. I think this is basically correct today.)
    ```

      I don't think Scott is himself alt-right, just that I would assign a significant non-zero probability to that possibility.

      >Please stop scaring my patients; they have enough anxiety already.

      Even taking this as what he says... Scott is asking people to downplay Trump in order to avoid causing anxiety for people that get stressed about world issues.  That seems like a a really weird take.  Also, Scott's take on racism in that post is just as stupid as I remember.  By the logic Scott uses, as long as someone says they aren't racist, you aren't allowed to call them racist.

      I think the real aim of Scott is revealed in your paraphrase:

      >People like me — a left-leaning Jewish atheist in the Bay Area — don't really have much to fear from them. 

      Scott is in a privileged position in which all the policies Trump pushes that put migrants in cages and hurt various disadvantaged groups aren't actually a perceived risk to himself by Scott, but being labeled a racist is perceived as a risk by Scott.  Thus Scott spends thousands of words to normalize Trump and to get people to stop using the word racist.  It's not alt-right, but it is some /r/enlightenedcentrism and alt-righters find it useful because it gives them more room to mask themselves (hence the culture war thread gradually getting colonized by altrighters until Scott shut it down and they spun off into themotte).

      This pattern is continued in other posts.  The anti-reactionary faq tries really hard to steelman reactionaries.  And Scott doesn't agree with neoreactionaries, but by taking their ideas seriously, he drags the Overton window of his blog and the commenters he attracts rightward.  Conversely, Scott fails at his attempts to steelman leftists ideas...

      To get back to u/[wooohooohooo](https://www.reddit.com/user/wooohooohooo/)'s question.  If they do chose to make slatestarcodex the place they hang out on reddit, they should avoid going go themotte and keep an eye open on what other subreddits people who post in SSC also frequent.  To give an example sometimes a person is just interested in IQ as a measure of intelligence... and sometimes they have an agenda to push to argue that IQ is a valid measure of intelligence in order to argue that African people are less intelligent.
