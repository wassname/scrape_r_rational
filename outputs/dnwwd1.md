  Would you mind putting a description? Ideally a hook and explanation for why it belongs here. I'm dumbfounded by those tags, but that might just be me.

    ```
    What would actually happen if you made Monkey Ball IRL?
    ```

- u/LazarusRises:
  ```
  But like... why do the balls need to have monkeys in them for the police to keep playing the game??

  ```
  So....it's a spoof on how video games are naturally ridiculous and cruel if literally translated into a real life game?
