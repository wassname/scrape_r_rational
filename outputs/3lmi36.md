  While I'm not quite sure this would be considered strictly rational, this is one of the most fun D&D stores I've ever read.

    /tg/ has a bounty of great stories. There was one very long saga I remember about a group of Earth humans dropped into a typical D&D setting, and they try to keep themselves together as a group and survive. I remember there was a bit of a focus on warring technology; that was where I first learned about the strategic benefits of mounted soldiers.

      10 minutes of googling later... "Stranded in Fantasy"?
      ```

      - u/Transfuturist:
        ```
        Yes, that sounds right.
        ```

    It is indeed fantastically entertaining, to be sure.

    At the very least, I would call it at least somewhat rational, as they decided to go munchkinning for enormous profits.

      It was like watching a paperclipping AI with a few transistors loose and a utility function composed of dollar signs.

        That is a good way of putting it. At a certain point his motivations don't just jump the shark, they airlift the aboleth.

    I'm halfway through, laughing like a hyena. It is glorious.

    It's not D&D but have you ever read the tale of [Old Man Henderson?](http://1d4chan.org/wiki/Old_Man_Henderson)
    ```

- u/Vebeltast:
  ```
  I did something like this once. I built a fighter that did enough damage per round to tunnel through normal materials at speed, according to the hit-points-per-inch-of-thickness tables in the DMG, and then started bypassing dungeons by going through walls and around fortifications. Eventually my DM got sufficiently annoyed that he declared that the wizard's tower that was the next dungeon had walls of solid adamantine. Mistake. Adamantine has a price-per-pound. It's a *big* price-per-pound. I funded basically the rest of the campaign by selling off chunks of that tower.
