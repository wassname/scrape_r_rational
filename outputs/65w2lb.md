## [D] Monday General Rationality Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics!  Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world?  Have you:

* Seen something interesting on /r/science?
* Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
* Figured out how to become immortal?
* Constructed artificial general intelligence?
* Read a neat nonfiction book?
* Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?

  This is perhaps slightly off topic, but I ended up at a church service again the other day. I'm assuming like myself most of the people here aren't​ religious, but every time I do go to a church service I'm stuck again by the staying power of the institution. It's a meme in the fullest of the original meaning I feel. With a more negative mind you can see how the various institutions work to propel it on. The social censor is obviously mostly gone now, but I still felt bad having to step out of the line going up for communion. You can really see how in days gone by the church would be nearly inescapable.

  Relatedly this has reminded me about my biggest problem with the idea of a totally material universe. Something about consciousness always seems weird to me coming purely out of meat. I acknowledge that it almost certainly does, but there's a part of me that wants to go. I think therefore there is something more to meat to me.

    Try reading up on predictive coding and see if your intuitions don't start to shift the other way.  For me, the Hard Problem sounds like a problem if I think of the brain as a passive, bottom-up signal transducer, but not if I think of it as an active, top-down signal predictor.

    What dissuaded me from this perspective is the idea that if the mind is nonphysical that doesn't help questions about consciousness. "Just" because there's something nonphysical interacting somehow with brains, why does *that* lead to consciousness?

    If we are going to be talking about memes, then you should read [Triangle Opportunity](https://www.inkitt.com/stories/horror/7465?ref=v_c35fab34-bc27-42a5-ab24-07ad6bd4457d&started_reading=true) by [Alex Beyman](https://www.inkitt.com/AlexBeyman?ref=v_c35fab34-bc27-42a5-ab24-07ad6bd4457d). It's a commonly reoccurring theme in this stories where memes (especially ones to do with religion) act a lot like an infectious disease. There's a [sequel](https://www.inkitt.com/stories/scifi/13278?ref=v_c35fab34-bc27-42a5-ab24-07ad6bd4457d) too.

    EDIT: This isn't meant to be belittling any emotional difficulties you may have, but rather to prove a similar story for reading that relates to the topic.

    I think of religion as an exploit. I think that we are evolutionary rewarded for figuring things out, understanding our environment, and feel low level fear when we don't. 

    As we became more and more intelligent, we came upon questions that can not be answered with things like "tiger bad", "blue berries good". Questions about life, death, purpose. Being unable to fully understand our "environment" we feel anxiety. 

    Along comes religion and gives simple, understandable answers. And once we accept those answers, the anxiety drops away and we are rewarded by ancient systems put in place to promote adaption.

    Combine this vulnerability with another vulnerability - our sponge-like to ability to soak up information as young, often with little or no verification, and you have a potent security hole for a "memetic virus".

    Other traits, like wanting to conform to the tribe, be in the "in" group, etc. add to this effect.

    Struggling with the nature of consciousness is fine. Taking the easy answers not from evidence but just to feel good is in my opinion less fine, in any context.

  I'm trying to find my rhythm doing sports; I really don't know what I'm doing, but I'm trying to be more fit and more... I dunno, energetic?

  Do you guys have any advice on what kind of training regimen I should adopt? How should I even decide? I'm not trying to lose weight (I'm kinda scrawny), and while I would like to gain muscle mass, it's not really a priority for me. What worries me most is akrasia; I've still haven't managed to keep doing the same sport for two years, and often miss sessions every few weeks/months (my beeminder page has a few bumps).

    Find what (general categories​ of things) you like to do.

    I don't like running so much unless it involves chasing a ball. I like the speed of cycling. I am allergic to chlorine pool treatments. I like hitting things. I like hauling stuff up a mountain.

    So I do tennis, cycling, and backpacking.

    I'm a cycle commuter, it's the only way I'd get exercise apart from walking the dog.

    Using a bicycle in your daily life is an easy way to force yourself to exercise, I would recommend it if you can make it work. Even one or two days a week (like I used to do when I had a 14km commute each way) can be really helpful.

  I've been thinking about irrational artificial intelligences.

  If humans had well-defined utility functions, would they become paperclippers? I'm thinking not, given that humans have a number of utility functions that often conflict, and that no human has consolidated and ranked their utility functions in order of utility. Is it because humans are irrational that they don't end up becoming paperclippers? Or is it because they can't integrate their utility functions?

  Following from that thought: where do human utility functions come from? At the most basic level of evolution, humans are merely a collection of selfish genes, each "aiming" to self-replicate (because really it's more of an anthropic principle: we only see the genes that are able to self-replicate). All behaviours derive from the function/interaction of the genes, and thus our drives, simple (reproduction, survival) and complex (beauty, justice, social status) all derive from the functions of the genes. How do these goals arise from the self-replication of genes? And can we create a "safe" AI with emergent utility functions from these principles?

  (Would it have to be irrational by definition? After all, a fully rational AI should be able integrate all utility functions and still become a paperclipper.)
  ```

  - u/callmebrotherg:
    ```
    Rationality or lack thereof has nothing to do with paperclipping, I think. Something that blindly maximizes paperclips is, well, a paperclipper from our point of view, but humans are paperclippers in our own way to anything that doesn't share enough of our values.
    ```

    - u/eniteris:
      ```
      What combination of traits leads to paperclipping?

      A well-defined utility function is a must. (Most) humans don't have a well-defined utility function. Is that sufficient? If we could work out the formula for the human utility function, would that automagically make all humans into paperclippers?

      Actually, the human utility function probably integrates a bunch of diminishing returns and loss aversion and scope blindness, so that probably balances out and makes it seem like humans aren't paperclippers.

      Programming in multiple utility functions with diminishing returns? Probably someone smarter than me has already thought of that one before.

        > (Most) humans don't have a well-defined utility function. Is that sufficient? If we could work out the formula for the human utility function, would that automagically make all humans into paperclippers?

        I think that we generally use "paperclipper" to talk about things that maximize a sole thing, relative to our human perspective.

        If you're calling "anything that works to maximize its values" a paperclipper, I think the definition stops being very useful.

        Once we extend the definition, everything starts to look like it maximizes stuff.

        Sure, I think that humans can probably be modeled as maximizing some multi-variate, complex function that's cobbled together by evolution. 

        It's generally agreed upon, though, that we're not demonstrating the single-minded focus of an optimization process. (Esp. as paperclipping tends to be defined relative to humans, anyway.)

        One could argue that the satisficing actions we take in life actually maximize some meta-function that focuses on both maximizing human values plus some other constraints for feasibility, morals, etc., but then *everything* would be defined as maximizing things.
        ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      I don't quite think so.  There are sensory experiences we can have (eg: rewards) which *change* the internal models our brains use to represent motivation and plan action.  A paperclipper, by definition, never updates its motivations.  Thus, with a human, you can argue: you can bring to their attention facts which will update their motivations.  With a paperclipper, you can't: unless you're giving them information about paper-clips, they'll just keep doing the paper-clip thing.
      ```

  - u/Wiron:
    ```
    Humans can't become paperclippers because most human goals cannot be endlessly maximized. For example if someone wants to have free time than thinking to much about optimalizing is counterproductive. If someone wants to have children he doesn't think about infinite amount.  *"The one small garden of a free gardener was all his need and due, not a garden swollen to a realm."*
    ```

    - u/Sailor_Vulcan:
      ```
      Maybe the smaller garden had greater value to him than a large garden? So by choosing the smaller garden he WAS maximizing his values. And perhaps if he spent too much time pondering how to make his garden exactly how he likes it, he will have less time to make the garden exactly how he likes it, and even less time to spend in it overall. So by not taking too much time to think about the decision of big garden or small garden, he was also maximizing his values?

      Just a thought.

  an edit of something I posted to spacebattles a little earlier, explaining why I don't think UBI will happen. Does anyone have counterpoint? I'm honestly a little iffy about my own reasoning, and it's the sort of thing I don't want to be wrong about because it affects my long-term plans.

  ___

  I don't think UBI is going to happen, but not for the reasons everyone else has been talking about. Assume computers can automate basically every job, and assume that computers can do so in a way that's better and cheaper that people can. Considering how cheap cost of living can be for humans, that would mean cost of living can become even cheaper. Thus, people are cheap enough to hire not because it's necessary, but because it's *prestigious.* Imagine an MMO that simulates wars where most people play as mercenaries, and the rich can hire them for a dozen dollars a day, with the company that owns the IP getting a cut of that payment. Right now, something like that doesn't work primarily for networking reasons-- whales already exist that will drop hundreds a day on a game.

  So I predict the confluence of extremely cheap labor and better AI will result in the continuing existence of a job market no matter how good automation gets. There will probably be a period where massive job deficits exist and cause civil unrest, but COL still isn't low enough for this to work, but I don't think that period will last long enough to cause the political will to have UBI.

  My back of the envelope calculation goes like this:

  Let's assume Moore's law more-or-less holds, and a human brain requires ~an exaflop of computing power. An i7-4790k has a theoretical maximum of 43.92 gigaflops. Obviously that's never getting hit, but it's an older machine regardless. Therefore it'll be about 2\*log2(10\^18/(43.92\*10\^9))=~49 years until a home computer is as computationally powerful as the human brain. That doesn't necessarily mean we're getting strong AI then, but AI will still be incredibly smart and relatively cheap by at most 2070. And considering that's just for near-human-level AI, which isn't necessary for most jobs, I think we'll be hitting peak automation at least a decade earlier for basically every single job. so that gives us 40 years to play with, so until ~2060.

  Meanwhile, coming from this end of the scale, according to the [Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/emp/ep_table_201.htm), by 2024 they expect that ~25% of jobs will be in "Goods-producing, excluding agriculture," or "Retail trade" or "transportation and warehousing." These will probably get automated first, but it'll take a while, and some people will sucessfully re-train. On the downside though, losing that many jobs will likely cause a recession of some sort. But still, I don't see unemployment breaching the mid-thirties until past 2035 or so. And even that won't be enough for massive civil unrest if Greece is any indication.

  That effectively leaves about 25 years for UBI to be implemented. Now, it's not impossible that UBI gets implemented in that window-- 25 years is a decent amount of time, but I personally don't think a government will be able to reform the entire welfare system around it in anywhere near that timeframe.

    There are three issues with your timing:

    1. It's possible to distribute calculations across multiple computers.
    2. Graphics cards have significantly more operations per second (11.3 teraflops for an NVIDIA GTX 1080 Ti, ~257 times faster than an i77-4790k) for parallelisable functions, and lots of machine learning algorithms are suitable.
    3. The human brain doesn't really work like a computer. Its "real" computational power is almost certainly at least a factor of 100 smaller than 1 exaflops.

    As an example (a slightly misleading one) of point 3, a human can generally perform under 1 floating point operation a second (maybe up to 10 flops for a savant, but even that would be virtually impossible).

    The brain simply hasn't had long enough to evolve optimal calculation processes. A $2 calculator can outperform every human alive when performing complex operations, and a desktop PC can probably beat out every human combined with room to spare.

    The difficulty with artificial intelligences is that they don't have the built-in processing faculties that a human brain does (so vision, for example, requires us to come up with the algorithms anew). This is also their strength, because they can potentially do it far more efficiently.

    Consider that if humans truly have 1 exaflops of computational power, the world's total artificial computational power (hard to find a figure, but probably under 1,000 exaflops) ought to be exceeded by a small town. So why use computers at all, if a single human is smarter than ~100,000 high-end GPUs?

    I contend that computers, especially supercomputers, are more than fast enough to exceed apparent human intelligence already. We're just trying to catch up on evolution, which has relentlessly optimised for a problem space that computers are naive to.
    ```

    - u/GaBeRockKing:
      ```
      >There are three issues with your timing:

      My timing is designed to be very permissible. I'm not saying "we have to wait until 2070 until there's strong AI," I'm saying "We're absolutely guaranteed to get strong AI by 2070," even if we have to resort to EMs and human uploading to do it. I do that instead of an earlier estimate because we don't actually know if moore's law will hold and optimism bias can be a scary think.
