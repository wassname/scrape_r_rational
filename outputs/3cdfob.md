## Idea for a rational epic fantasy choose your own adventure story

### Post:

I had an idea for a way to introduce regular people to rational fiction: a choose your own adventure story kind of like "Dungeon Keeper Ami" or "No matter what Happens, I still won't become an Anime Character"! Here's the premise I came up with:

The young hero, spoken of in the ancient prophecy has to save the world without screwing it over. But little do they know that they are a pawn in a dangerous game of the gods, and both friend and enemy alike might not be what they seem.

Basically it's high fantasy (or maybe low fantasy in disguise as high fantasy) with some swords and sorcery thrown in, but the choices the main character makes have natural consequences and implications for the world around him, and the readers get to vote on what he does next at certain junctions. If he dies or otherwise completely fails his heroic quest so badly that he can't recover, the story starts over with a new protagonist. Realizing that your heroic quest is not so heroic is not grounds for a restart of course. Becoming a well-intentioned extremist isn't either, as long as you are still able to wake up from it and see sense eventually.

What do you think of this idea? And where should I host it? Also, anyone want to help beta read what I write to help make sure the characters, setting and story stay self-consistent?
