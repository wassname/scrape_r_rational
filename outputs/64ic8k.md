  Reminds me of the Dinosaur Comics strip on a similar topic: http://www.qwantz.com/index.php?comic=2944

  As always with Dinosaur Comics, don't forget the following after you've read the strip:

  [Mouseover Title Text](#s " apollo was like, damn, i keep getting owned on Earth.  i don't know why i keep hanging out on a planet that's full of people who just own me so hard like fifty times i day.  damn dude, i can't stop getting owned by mortals.  damn")

  [Contact Link Email Subject](#s " when cassandra said she was going to die of old age at 103, everyone was like, hahaha, what an idiot, that'll never happen!!  then she died and everyone was like, wow, her prediction came true just like EVERY SINGLE PREDICTION SHE'S MADE ON A DAILY BASIS FOR THE PAST 80 YEARS, wtf is wrong with us??  wow")

  [RSS Entry Title Text](#s " GANGSTER: i run an illegal gambling operation and i need a tough name for that / CHILD: bookie / GANGSTER: no, see, i'm a tough criminal who - / CHILD: BOOKIE")
  ```

    The Dinosaur Comics one doesn't quite make sense unless no one believed anything she said, not just prophecies. Because her curse was that no one would believe her prophecies, but they would always be true.

    So if she made a prophecy that somebody would kill her, then they would. Even if they didn't believe they would.
    ```

      Exactly. If she *did* have the power to make up prophecies (as opposed to just passively receiving them) then she'd just prophesy that they wouldn't attempt to kill her at all.

      They'd believe that they would attempt to kill her, but something would always come up to make them change their minds.

      > Because her curse was that no one would believe her prophecies, but they would always be true.

      That's the point: Prophesize horse A will win, bet on horse A. Bookies bet on horse B. Cassandra wins.
      ```

      - u/DCarrier:
        ```
        I think what he means is that she doesn't get to pick the prophesies. Unless she's lucky enough to get a prophesy about a winning horse, that won't work. On the other hand, you can bet on most anything, so as long as she gets enough prophesies she should be okay. Keeping people from killing her would be a problem, but she could hire guards and solve that with money instead of with prophesies.
        ```

      - u/Fresh_C:
        ```
        I was specifically talking about the part where she prophesizes that the people who lost money to her in bets would kill her.

        As described in the comic she prophesizes "these people will kill me". Then those people believe "I won't kill her". Then they don't.


        But the way her curse should work is that if she prophesizes "These people will kill me" then they'll believe "I won't kill her", then they absolutely should kill her, even though they believed they wouldn't. Because her prophesies always come true.
        ```

        - u/None:
          ```
          Maybe she could say "if you try to kill me, you will succeed."

          They don't believe that they will succeed, and don't try in the first place.
          ```

      I know I'm late, but-

      I think it's the "always come true" part they've dropped, not the "only prophecies are disbelieved" part. That is, only after she's seen her own death can she make people believe it won't happen, but in doing so, she actually changes the outcome. In fact, the wording used in the comic is "see the future", not "make inevitable prophecies".
      ```

      - u/Fresh_C:
        ```
        I can kinda see that if you're willing to ignore the original legend, but it makes the whole thing feel ambiguous to me.

        Does this mean that nobody believes anything she ever says regarding the future? If so that opens a huge can of worms. Basically everytime she tried to make an appoint with someone she'd have to say "I won't show up at 10am" or otherwise carefully word her sentences so that she either says the opposite of what she wants them to think, or doesn't make any concrete statements about the future.

        Not that it would be impossible to live like that, but it just makes the whole thing feel more complicated.
        ```

        - u/LupoCani:
          ```
          That does create the issue of "sharing prophetic knowledge of the future" vs "sharing information about the future that has also been confirmed by prophecy". I think it's rather clear-cut, though- if she her prophetic ability tells her something, she will be disbelieved trying to tell others. They said "*if* she sees her own death she can convince them it won't happen", meaning it doesn't affect statements that aren't directly supported by prophecy.

          By extension, I would think that yes, given the rules as they seemed to work in the DC, you would be disbelieved if you accurately stated your time of arrival.

          We can of course​ imagine clauses like "the effect is optional if she has also learnt of it by other means", or "she can specifically choose to gain no knowledge of her arrival time, leaving her free to speak of it". But, there's no evidence to support that.

          Of course, there are a number of ways around this. It's not even as bad as one might think. The easiest solution is- "I'll be there at 22:05" when in fact she'll be there at 22:00. Her future-seeing ability doesn't say this, since it's outright wrong, so the knowledge should be unaffected.

  I find it very amusing but how is it rationalist? Not suggesting it be removed (this sub is pretty low activity as it is) but I was just curious.

    [RT] for Rational, not Rationalist. By my [personal definition](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/why-rational-fiction-is-inherently-problematic.34730/page-54#post-7592741) this surely fits, and by the sidebar, it at least hits "characters solve problems through the intelligent application of their knowledge and resources" and "the fictional world has consistent rules, and sticks to them" given how we see Cassandra abusing her vision to fuck with Apollo. Not bad for a 5-panel strip.

    My definition includes "if it's upvoted by r/rational that's good enough for me" and it looks like it is.

    Does pixel art count as minimalist? I hear from reliable sources who wish to remain anonymous (such as myself) that there is a thriving market for pixel-art pornography.
