## [Q] I'm trying to list all of Ted Chiang's freely (and legally) available works here. Please contribute if you know of any links.

### Post:

**Bad Character** (*Not a story, but I like the way he thinks*) - http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/05/16/if-chinese-were-phonetic


**What's Expected of Us** - http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v436/n7047/full/436150a.html
