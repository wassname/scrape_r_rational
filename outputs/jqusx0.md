## Delve Retrospective as at Chapter 108

# Disclaimer

I'm not sure how appropriate posting this here is. I'll update on the response.

I wrote this as a stream of consciousness for a Discord channel, but it quickly became too long, so I decided to post it on Reddit (and this is the most appropriate subreddit that I'm a member of). I haven't rewritten the stream of consciousness.

&#x200B;

#### Thoughts

I'll soon catch up to the series.

I'm probably not going to join Patreon when I catch up. If I do decide to read it on a weekly basis, a monthly payment of $x to stay 8 chapters ahead feels quite excessive. Furthermore, I rarely follow serials on a week to week basis for extensive periods of time. It's very easy for me to set up a subscription and keep it maintained for months while I'm not using the service. As a value proposition, Patreon given my reading habits seems like a bad idea.

All of the above said, I'm just not as invested in the series, I don't think I'll enjoy it all that much.

The character I am/was most invested in was Lady V (for a long stretch of time after their first interaction with her, I was much more excited about the prospect of her reappearance than anything else that happened in the story).

The Watch's Ambush for her and her subsequent depression was kinda sad. Rain had been making tangible progress building a rapport with her, and she had set him up as her second in command. Rain's animosity towards Velika for the massacre while reasonable feels unfair. Velika acted only and entirely in self defense. Furthermore, she had explicitly gone out of her way to dissuade them from just such an attempt. After Westbridge's castigation, she went out of her way to subdue the Watch's combatants without killing them (in part to give them the impression that she was so far above them that resistance was futile). She reiterated this again with her challenge at the arena. Again, the message was the same (even if you all came at once, you couldn't beat me, so don't try). This was a bluff, but it was a successful one.

As a ruler, she wasn't a tyrant. The Watch themselves admitted she hadn't killed anyone. Lord Rill was in charge and had been tolerable. There was no just cause for their rebellion. As far as I can tell, the Watch only retaliated because of hurt pride.

&#x200B;

Given the circumstances, her retaliation to their preemptive strike was justified. She killed all of them, but it was entirely in self defence. That she didn't go out of her way to retaliate against the Watch officers that hadn't been involved in the massacre showed admirable restraint which was progress for her. Earning Rain's animosity for justified self defence (to the extent that when she left his most salient thoughts was regret that he could do nothing about the "murder" of his friend) feels exceedingly bitter. It wasn't murder.

I really dislike the author's decision to have the Watch act so rashly on injured pride. They risked not only all their sentinels (and other participants), but all members stationed at Fel Sadanis. Velika could have retaliated to their rebellion by wiping out all their members. No one in the city would have been able to stop her, and they had no guarantee that she wouldn't. They had no guarantee of success either. They relied solely on their surprise attack. They had no recourse should it fail. If she didn't die with the first volley, everyone stationed there would be dead.

The massive potential downside to their plan was foreseeable, and the upside was limited. Again, Velika was not actively ruling, and the Rill lead administration was tolerable. Her rule hadn't yet caused the deaths of any citizen. The payoff matrix here was horribly lopsided.

The Watch acted with spectacular incompetence here, and I think it's arguably a case of idiot ball. The Watch rebelled so that the story would progress a certain way. I wish they hadn't because I liked the direction the story would have progressed then. I'm much more annoyed that the author snapped that future away than that he dumbed down the Watch for the plot.

&#x200B;

But I think all of this is ignoring a much more glaring issue. I became exceptionally invested in what was ultimately a story arc character, and cared much more about the character than everything else that happened in the story. The protagonist's challenges and his growth (while nice) did not speak to me in the same way. I think this is a fail of story engagement. If I cared so much about Velika that my most salient association with the Fel Sadanis arc was annoyance at the Watch's rebellion and what it meant for her character, then it sounds like I'm reading the wrong story. Fel Sadanis was an amazing arc for Rain's character, but I cared so much less about all the growth Rain underwent during the arc. I'm aware that how I experienced the story is very different from the modal experience of most readers of the story.

I can handle stories where I don't like the main character. My favourite webcomic/manga is a story where the main character doesn't rank among my top ten (my favourite character does share some traits with Lady V). In said stories though, I usually have several other characters that I find very compelling. I think Delve is different in that I was overly attached to one character and the developments involving them left a very bitter taste in my mouth.

I mean, current Rain is a character that on priors I would expect to enjoy very much. Hacking the interface, gaining progressively finer grained control and understanding of the system, obsessive mathematical optimisation of his build, developing scripts to interact with the system and the interface, etc. are all things that I expect would speak to me.

I think Rain has sort of delivered on the promised competence porn, but rather than greatly enjoying all of these developments, I'm still left with the bitter taste. It's disconcerting.

&#x200B;

The sense that I'm reading the wrong story (experiencing it markedly differently from how most would) makes me doubt the wisdom of continuing. I'm almost caught up, so I just might sunk costs it, but I'm really not sure I should. I'm worried that if I do progress I would still have the lingering bitter aftertaste over the world that wasn't. I do expect to eventually get over Fel Sadanis, and the concept of a rogue Citizen is interesting (but I expect that she would be removed from the story/it's sort of her epilogue).

Avoiding other spoilers, does Velika remain a relevant character post 108?

### Comments:

  I feel like this is missing the point that Lady V was essentially a tyrant who had seized the city and was holding them all hostage. The watch had one single chance to kill her and from their perspective, retake the city and overthrow a dictator. Sure they acted rashly, but all this talk about how Velika hadn't killed anyone misses the point that they were entirely justified in attempting to assassinate her. Their reasons for trying to kill her were arguably more valid than her self-defense, are we arguing that occupying dictators are the ones in the right when defending themselves against resistance movements? 

  What happened was a tragedy, but Velika was decidedly the antagonist of it. The entire thing could have been avoided if she came clean, but she couldn't because she was a dictator ruling by the equivalent of military might and she couldn't show weakness.

  We as the audience know that it wouldn't have solved the main problem, but we also know that if it weren't for Rain then this entire plot by the Citizens was so stupid and reliant on a single point of failure that the entire city would have died.

    >...   that the entire city would have died.

    The city **did** die, for all practical purposes.

    Had Velika and Westbridge not invaded and put up the barrier, the Watch and the Guild could have handled the rank shift so much better.  For starters, more of them would have been alive to help, and they wouldn't have been constantly drained of mana trying to charge the barrier.

    Let's not sideline that point, theirs was the inciting action that caused the death of practically the entire population.  Now, it would well be argued that because of the *other* invasion force (that subsequently slipped away unscathed), they were equally screwed.  But the Watch, Guild and Halgrave (sp?) could have put up a good fight for that at least.
    ```

    - u/LordSwedish:
      ```
      Also, whenever someone invades you for your own good, it is perfectly reasonable to tell them to fuck off.

      I'd agree there. That army beat a whole strike team of citizens, Halgrave had no chance. 

      That said, I think from the POV of the average civilian they'd be better off under the empire. That army wouldn't kill them and might even protect them from the rank shift. Velika ignored them to sulk while the city died.

    I think something can be morally right but tactically really dumb. Like, I 100% agree that the Watch are justified in trying to take back the city. But like, it was still a dumb call. They're betting *a lot* on trying to take Velika off-guard, in a poor situation (the whole "she evaded their attacks by just re-entering the dungeon" thing), on the hope that she defeated them individually or in small groups and would lose against the entire group.
    ```

    - u/IICVX:
      ```
      Yeah exactly. 

      Death to tyrants is an excellent motivation, but, like, try at least a little bit to make sure it's the *tyrant* who dies?
      ```

    - u/LordSwedish:
      ```
      But is there any chance that a chance this good would come again? Is there any certainty that she would re-enter the dungeon again rather than send underlings? They had to do something before she became established and this was their only option. If she had been slightly slower or farther out she probably would have died.

      I honestly don't see a better option for them except lay down and hope this awful plan doesn't result in the entire city and most of the people being destroyed...

  I disagree about Velika. Firstly she was the instigator of the conflict, she invaded the city through military might and held everyone hostage. Given that the locals have a de-facto right to rebel for freedom - especially since this is a pre-modern world. Peaceful protests and referendums are not a practical option in this world. 

  Secondly Velika was becoming increasingly erratic and unstable in her behaviour, and this is someone who could physically kill the entire city one by one without much trouble. In addition to her decreasing stability she was on the verge of tipping into a death spiral where she terrifies people to rule through fear, then people make mistakes because they're terrified, so she kills more people to set an example, repeat until rock bottom. Remember that she was shown struggling to tell the difference between mistakes and treachery. 

  Given this the watch had two options: Do nothing and pray she climbs out of her funk. Take your one chance to kill her while you can. We as readers know the solution is the first one, because Rain quite quickly found a way to control the barrier and that will make Velika calm down. The watch did not. They had two high risk choices and chose.
  ```

- u/ArgentStonecutter:
  ```
  Velika is also the agent of an invader that has so far as they can tell doomed them to die horribly inside an impenetrable bubble. And they have no access to her internal dialog.
  ```

- u/gramineous:
  ```
  An organisation that solves serious situations with martial might (or the threat of it) tries to use martial might to solve a situation. I don't think that counts as an idiot ball. People not properly adapting to facing a new threat and using outdated strategies/thinking is pretty standard, look at the responses to climate change for example.

  Throw in the stress of the situation and the fear of the Watch "losing" here negatively affecting the Watch as a whole organisation as they are perceived as weaker by their enemies and there's sufficient justification for the sequence of events, even if it ain't the best path for them to take.

  I could just be bias because I like the story and all though, so grains of salt and all.

  Anyway I've been reading ahead, super short answer is that Rain leaves Fel Seldanis and Velika doesn't follow him.

  > Avoiding other spoilers, does Velika remain a relevant character post 108?

  Everyone else seems to be ignoring this final question, but the answer is no. Due to Rain's plans, she is not relevant anymore and it doesn't seem likely she will become relevant. 

  Perhaps my read is wrong though, so other people chime in if you disagree.
  ```

- u/DragonGod2718:
  ```
  Given that most people think the Watch's decisions was reasonable given what they know (and that I'm aware I have a massive Velika bias), I'll be making a significant update in that direction.
  ```

  - u/EsquilaxM:
    ```
    Reading the comments us confusing, as I thought the watch didn't think she was going around killing people willy nilly or had any reason to think killing her would drop the dome.
    ```

- u/Dragfie:
  ```
  No. I felt that she is set up as being the deus-ex-machinima solution to a future problem, but given the pace that sounds like its going to be over a year.
  ```

  - u/gramineous:
    ```
    How do you draw the line between a deus ex machina and Chekhov's gun here?
    ```

    - u/Dragfie:
      ```
      Uh, i wasn't being too serious. Could be that, sure.
      ```

- u/EsquilaxM:
  ```
  I agree, the watch fucked up. We knew they were a faulty organisation, hypocritical and lacking self awareness, but this attack was a very very bad decision, for all the reasons you gave. I'm hoping there was a reason behind it that we don't know, something that the upper brass, the warden and goldplates, are privy to.

  It's happened a couple of times in the past that I've been disappointed by how stupid some decisions characters make are, then later find out they had their reasons (like The Mad King's plan in Blood Song and the explanation given in the opening chapters of the sequel) so thats what I'm hoping for here.

  I think Rain is aware that his feelings towards Velika aren't fair. I think he'll resolve that in time.

  I, too, don't expect Velika to come back for a very long time.
  ```

- u/MilesSand:
  ```
  First thing she did upon entering the city was murder a guard. Them she got scolded and her guardian cast resurrection and smoothed it all over.


  Then she went and established herself as ruler using the threat of violence.

  Then she went on and proved herself incompetent at managing subordinates who have their own subordinates. In other words, unfit to rule.

  Not sure how you missed all the lack of any redeeming features for a leadership role

      You only had a problem with the local police forces trying to depose her and called it injured pride.
