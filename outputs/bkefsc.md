## How do you make a rational ‘murder mystery’ type villain work?

### Post:

I'm facing a problem with my story, the [Need to Become Stronger](https://needtobecomestronger.wordpress.com/2016/10/17/chapter-1/). The problem is that nobody really cares about the main villain of the story. I know this because there is very little speculation about who the hidden mastermind actually is, and if nobody is talking about it then nobody is thinking about it.

This is a big problem because villains are often a vital source of tension for stories. Sure, NTBS has plenty of lesser villains who provide their own conflict, but without revealing the main villain it is hard to tie it all together into a coherent whole. I want the reader to feel the same kind of pressure the main character feels, the same kind of need to solve the problem *now* before any more people die, but how can I get the reader to care about someone who is ultimately invisible?

Normal murder mysteries get around this problem by regularly showing glimpses of the villain. He leaves subtle clues behind, taunts the hero with cryptic riddles, and as a result the hero nearly catches him but arrives at the scene just a second too late. Near the climax of the story the villain might capture the hero and give them a chilling lecture wherein they display their demented psyche, only for the hero to just barely escape, etc.

This doesn’t work in a rational story, because the villain simply isn’t that dumb. A rational villain wouldn’t taunt, lecture, or even show up to do anything in person unless it was absolutely necessary. So instead, you tend to end up with the situation where the hero and the villain never really interact, and it makes it much harder to have any kind of hero-villain tension for the overarching plot.

Basically, I'm trying to avoid the problem of Wonder Woman, where the hero spends the whole movie dreading this evil god who the audience is not even sure is real, and then it ends with "oh yeah Ares is that guy". Or HPMOR for that matter, where Harry spends the whole story dismissing Voldemort as a threat and then when he does finally show up he dies five minutes later. Don't get me wrong, Voldemort was absolutely terrifying in that story, but there never was any meaningful \*conflict\* between him and the hero because (as Harry rightly points out) they would just immediately kill each other if they saw the other as a threat. Even in the few chapters where they do interact as hero and villain, the only reason Voldemort doesn't kill Harry instantly is because of some handwavey magical rule that was never even mentioned before.

So, how do I solve this problem? Possible answers I have considered so far:

· Have characters spent more time speculating about the villain, building him or her up in their minds

· Clever use of dramatic irony (The HPMOR method – though this can make the MC seem painfully stupid)

· Find more ways to show the villain’s presence indirectly, revealing them through their actions rather than their words

· Have another character interact with the villain, to provide a kind of second-hand account without really showing them

If you have any other suggestions, please let me know!

  When I took a stab at a "rational" (in approach, not necessarily motivation) murder mystery villain, I had them go to great lengths to cover their tracks, but leave clues behind unintentionally where they had incomplete information. E.g., they dispose of an item through a slot into what they believe to be a half-full waste receptacle of similar items, not realizing that another character emptied it a few hours beforehand--which both makes the item easy to pick out (as it's the only one in the container) and narrows down the time when it must have been deposited. You could probably do something similar with clues to the villain's identity that are only available to the hero because the villain didn't have the info necessary to erase them. It's an asymmetric kind of interaction, but it's something.
  ```

  - u/Sophronius:
    ```
    That's clever and makes sense, but it's more a way to make a rational villain vulnerable than to create real hero-villain interplay. Ideally you'd want the villain to make a mistake in a way that's directly tied to their personality, giving the hero an 'aha' moment where they realize the enemy has the same bias and motivation they do or something like that. Hm, that gives me some ideas actually - thanks!

    (Btw, you totally missed an opportunity to add a link to your own story and do a shameless plug, there)

      Haha, I totally would have linked it if I could! It's actually a text roleplaying game I wrote rather than the kind of story that exists in a linkable format. Players investigate the crime scene and surrounding areas and find clues like the above. Also, I love your idea of the villain indirectly betraying their biases through the clues they leave behind.
      ```

- u/CaseyAshford:

  This was just my personal take but I think that it would be interesting if the story developed to the point where the "shadowy puppet-master" simply isn't that important. You did a great job showing how all the actors that created this outbreak of war were motivated by their own individual agendas and perspectives. Is it really necessary to have a single hidden mastermind working in the background who is responsible for everything?

  I think that you could have a great story in which the true enemy is the "darkness of the world". The hidden mastermind who arranged for the assassination of the Fourth Hokage and may have contributed to the current conflict can simply be another actor. Defeating him will not solve all the problems in the setting and may not even matter by the time the protagonists discover his identity.

  I think it would be interesting if Naruto discovers that Danzo or someone like him was the one who assassinated the Fourth Hokage purely out of a desire for political power or a disagreement with the policies he supported. Naruto might feel some catharsis out of defeating the man who killed his parents, but defeating this individual will not meaningfully help Naruto fulfill his goals of creating a better world. The story can easily continue on after this individual is defeated as there will be many more actors who can serve as individual antagonists to Naruto in his broader conflict with the "darkness of the world".
  ```

  - u/Sophronius:
    ```
    I do think a 'darkness of the world' type antagonist is very interesting, and I definitely want to incorporate elements of that in this story (a lot of Naruto's internal monologue as well as the Fourth's mission is about exactly that.) The problem however is that this doesn't lend itself to a very satisfying ending. If the solution is a gradual increase in rationality for the world's populace, then there is no clear point where the story should end. Same if the hero loses and just... what, gives up? Not very satisfying! 

    Canon Naruto gets around this by playing with the same idea of 'darkness', but also having a big villain who represents that struggle who can then be defeated to unite the world. Of course, the author handled the end very badly, but the idea was there. I do think you can make a story where the villain is a concept work, but it wouldn't be easy...
    ```

- u/jtolmar:
  ```
  My first thought is to give the protagonist an investigative tool that the villain doesn't know about. Like the Memento Mortem from Return Of The Obra Dinn, or (Ward spoilers) >!Kenzie's time camera!<, or whatever is appropriate in your genre. The villain doesn't cover their tracks against this new method, and leaks evidence. But they may be so generally careful that even this doesn't reveal the greatest evidence, and the signs might start drying up as they become aware of the protagonist's capabilities.
  ```

  - u/Sophronius:
    ```
    I really liked this plotpoint in "Black Cloaks, Red Clouds", where one of the characters develops a jutsu that allows them to see backwards in time. This allows them to watch as another character taunts someone by revealing their identity just before killing them. I think this is a really cool concept because it highlights the fact that in a world with magic you're \*never\* safe: Even if there is no spell in existence that can hope to defeat you, tomorrow it may turn out that there is. So it's a really cool twist on the 'you should have just killed him' trope.

    But in that story it only works as a gimmick, because it comes so out of left field. If I were to give that power to the hero right from the start, it could be really cool as a way to give them insight into the villain's past, letting them experience first-hand what their enemy went through to make them like this. But if I were to suddenly give the hero that power now, it would feel like an asspull, I think.
    ```

    - u/jtolmar:
      ```
      One way to make giving the hero a new power not feel like an asspull is to make them work for it.

      Get screwed over by being on the receiving end, deal with it, decide you want the power for yourself, overcome hurdles to get it.
      ```

  I think the problem with the villain in Ntbs is not that you've done a bad job making the readers care about him, it's just that there's nothing to think about. If you try to figure out the villain's identity it'll take you about 30 seconds before your only option left is to start playing guess who with Canon characters. One way to give the readers/main character some evidence to chew on, without breaking the idea that the villain is rational, is to have information which the readers/main character know to be false start to appear. The motivation behind the lie gives the reader some idea of what the villain wants, and that information can then shed light on past events, and give the reader a new lens to view the story with. The villain can stay rational though, because it's not hard to imagine a situation where deceiving the world is worth giving a small amount of information to a group that already knows you exist.
  ```

  - u/Sophronius:
    ```
    Yeah, I was thinking that too. I did drop hints throughout the story about the nature of the villain, but I've always erred on the side of caution because I'm worried that I'll make it too obvious and the audience will go "oh, so that's who it is." But I think you're right: If I divide it up into more side plots, or have the MC investigate something that turns out to be a dead end, then at least there'll be \*something\* for the audience to speculate about.

    &#x200B;

    **Slight spoiler:** What I think I'll do is that after all this, one of the characters goes and investigates all of the villain's sub-plots, trying to work out how this war started etc. That should give plenty of material to speculate about, I think.
    ```

    - u/Flashbunny:
      ```
      I read somewhere that authors almost universally overestimate the ability of readers to solve a mystery, because from their perspective whatever hints they've been dropping form a perfectly cohesive picture in their mind, but no one else can put them together because they aren't working backwards from the solution. On top of this, whilst the main character is likely to devote considerable time and effort into piecing together clues, readers just... aren't going to.

      This makes things difficult for a rational mystery, because any solution that a character devoting considerable time and effort can't reach is pretty much impossible for readers to find, unless they have *considerable* extra information.

      I've actually seen advice for authors that states that to put together a compelling mystery for readers, the author should take absolutely no steps to hide the solution beyond just not saying it outright - the readers will have enough trouble piecing together what's happened on their own, without increasing the complexity of the task.

      As for your story, I'm a reader and can sadly confirm that whilst I'm enjoying it, I've put very little effort into figuring out who the villain might be - as the OP of this comment chain says, there's just nothing to work with. There's not really any point in speculating without further data.
      ```

      - u/Sophronius:
        ```
        Ok, but then what does invite readers to speculate? I mean, obviously if the hints are too obscure it doesn't work, but if it's immediately obvious what's going on there's no speculation either. How do writers like Brandon Sanderson do this? I remember endlessly speculating about every detail of his Mistborn trilogies and excitedly talking about it with other readers at the time. But when I think about it, stuff like >!Vin's earring!< didn't give the reader much to go on either: You just knew that she had it, you knew something about the mechanics, and she occasionally displayed an unusual power. That was it, and it was still enough to get me guessing. :s

        HPMOR was the same way. A lot of stuff was really subtle or hard to guess, and everyone still speculated about it. Is it just a case of having a bigger fandom to discuss it with? Or is it more that the mysteries are more explicit, like how a guy in a black cloak shows up and attacks Hermione from her POV, and it just \*feels\* more mysterious than the Hokage building being blown up by someone with a red eye. 

        Or perhaps, it's more that in HPMOR there were just three real suspects (Harry, Dumbledore, Quirrel) and you already had a pretty good who they were and what motivated them, while in NTBS there's dozens of characters but they all have less screentime?
        ```

        - u/Flashbunny:
          ```
          To be honest, I'd actually forgotten that someone with a red eye had blown up the Hokage building, which I suppose is a sign of me not engaging with the mystery very much.

          I might actually just be the wrong person to ask about this though - I wouldn't be speculating about Mistborn trivia, I'd just wait until the next book came out with the answer. I may not be your target audience for the mystery!

          With that disclaimer, if I had to guess, I think the main reason is that so far the mystery feels like a background detail. Everything happening to our protagonists thus far has been almost entirely disconnected from it - you've pretty much outright stated that current events are only going as they are due to malign interference, but it's overshadowed *by* those events - they're the story I'm engaging with. It's ideal for a rational villain hiding their identity, but I only have so many thoughts to devote to your story (lovely as it is) and they're all going towards what's actually happening onscreen. Trying to work out who the real villain is just seems both unproductive (there's nothing to go on) and a bit less important.
          ```

          - u/Sophronius:
            ```
            Fair enough! I think spacing is also an issue here: every 'main plot' scene that gives hints as to what's going on behind the scenes is several chapters and sometimes months apart. And like you said, usually those scenes are stuck in the middle of a whole bunch of other stuff going on.

            I think you're right: Hopefully, once the investigation takes centre stage in the next arc/act, the mystery will start to loom bigger in people's minds.

            Btw, the scene I was referencing was this:

            >Hayate silently dropped to the ground and  ran up to where his quarry had vanished, his exhilaration replaced by  dread as he realized he had not been paranoid after all. The enemy had  left no trace behind, except… he traced a finger down the stone wall,  which felt strangely granular to the touch. He pressed his hand to the  surface, and the whole segment collapsed in a cloud of fine dust that  invaded his nose and mouth and nearly caused him to go down in another  fit of coughing.   
            >  
            >With one arm guarding his face he descended down the narrow tunnel, expelling chakra from his feet to stop himself from falling through the dust. Before long a chamber filled with stone pillars opened up before him, but the ground was far too even to be natural and too bare to be intended for human use. He ducked his head to enter, almost having to crouch under the low-hanging stone that had to be the foundation of the Hokage residence, and that was when he saw his target: Something which he had taken to be a shadow was flitting from one support pillar to the next, draped in a black cloak and hood that blended with the darkness as though it were part of it, moving about and doing something to the walls – and then stopped, and turned around. A baleful crimson eye blazed in his direction.  
            >  
            >...  
            >  
            >Hayate tried to cry out in alarm, but he must have inhaled some of the dust because he went down coughing. One by one his shadow clones vanished, until he was the last one left. His hands were slick with blood.  
            >  
            >The explosive tags detonated with the fury of a thousand suns.

    The Waves Arisen did that in an attempt to help build up Pain, and it \*kind of\* worked, but the problem with this tactic is that it's hard to create a meaningful scene if you're not allowed to describe the character it's about. If you write it from the villain's point of view, then it feels strange and cheaty if he or she never actually thinks about themselves - you're in their \*head\* after all, so why on earth don't you know who they are? And if it's from the perspective of a henchman or omnipresent point of view then it can very rapidly become cheesy, where you're describing an ominous silhouette going "GO FORTH AND DO THIS THING MY MINION" while standing in the shadows and weirdly refusing to turn on the lights.

        Haha, that's a fun idea, but it doesn't lend itself to a very imposing villain. I mean, they're not very frightening if they're so injured that they don't even know who they are. Although, maybe if they were some kind of fractured Old God type deity, slowly trying to piece themselves back together as the story progresses...

        There's definitely potential there - I love amnesia stories when done well - but yes, not something I can just introduce halfway into the story :P

      May just be me, but when I'm working on a project or just working thought a technical book, Thinking about myself (physically) is not something I often do. I may think about things I need to do or may want to, but that's about it.

      It' a little cheaty, but if you want a villain that prizes obscurity and is good at it, at some point the audience will need to know more than the protagonist or your villain will not get developed. You could just develop him fast during the final confrontation, but that's hard.

  I have insufficient knowledge of Naruto to give story specific advice (does canon Naruto even have a single villain?) but I do understand that it involves clans of ninjas fighting and that Leaf is both morally ambiguous and vulnerable to coup. 

  > A rational villain wouldn’t taunt, lecture, or even show up to do anything in person unless it was absolutely necessary. 

  Well, maybe. It depends... mostly on whether they have any interest in public relations. Which they well might, if your story is ultimately about war and politics. Consider Osama Bin Laden. I'd say he was both sufficiently morally misguided and sufficiently motivated to play the role of an evil storybook antagonist, and he was at least rational enough to exist in the real world. The public was certainly pretty fascinated with him. He absolutely gave speeches / propaganda, taunted, etc. He did ultimately die (although I don't think his own life was his top priority, so it's not clear to what degree he *lost*). Maybe he's actually just the idiot who took the figurehead position. But if you are *openly* an enemy of the protagonist, there are plenty of reasons to speak openly to them. Or at least openly speak to the public. Perhaps through a pseudonym or figurehead if you have a compelling reason to be *both* secretive and open.

  Also I think it *matters* that you are writing a world where a powerful ninja is a military force in their own right (unlike our world, where a world class fighter can be defeated by two basic-training soldiers)

  Note that your rational protagonist is showing up in person plenty of times. If your rational antagonist is able to accomplish their goals nameless and faceless, you need to give a good reason why they're able to do this because accomplishing a goal without involving oneself is harder than it seems.

  THAT SAID if that doesn't fit with your character that's fine! You can just have the protagonist be upset about the smaller agents of the real antagonist, or tell the story of how they piece together who the real driver of events is. If that is the case, audience fascination with the antagonist themselves wouldn't be the important part of the story.

  - u/Sophronius:
    ```
    Yeah, but this is a \*murder mystery\* type plot. Sure, I could have written a different type of scenario where the villain is happy to be out in the open, but that kind of defeats the point of having a mystery. Besides, it's a story about rational ninjas: It just makes sense to have a villain who relies on being unseen. And let's be honest, if you were living in a world where 90% of the people around you are supernatural assassins, you'd want to keep a low profile too.

    That said, it's entirely possible for the villain to have a separate public persona, and I very definitely intend for the villain to be someone that the reader is already acquainted with by the time their true intentions are revealed. But the issue with that is that if you have the villain playing the role of a friendly old grandma for 90% of the story, it just doesn't feel satisfying to have them end up as the villain of the story. There needs to be real hero-villain interaction, in order to build up the conflict leading up to their ultimate confrontation.
    ```

- u/crusher_bob:
  ```
  You can make the villain's manifesto or political position public, and have the hero interact with that.  They can have moral debates about how correct the villain's means or ends are.  They can anticipate things the villain would want to do and try to preempt them.  They can try to directly address the parts of the villain's motivation that make it villainous.  The hero can discover that part of why the villain's motivation is villainous is because of (maybe justified, maybe not) actions the hero or his allies undertook.

  &#x200B;

  That way, at least the hero gets to interact with the idea of the villain, if not the villain himself.

  On mobile, so overly brief:  I thought this was handled very well in _Hybrid Theory_ by Blade and Epsilon, to the point where I thought the story suffered when the protagonist gave the villain a name even in her own mind.  It was a very effective nameless villain just by the villain clearly existing and clearly being very powerful and their true nature being very mysterious but known-to-the-author.  It may be that the advice you want is from horror novels - how to make the reader scared of things that have no names.  If the reader doesn’t care who your villain is, my first thought is not that you haven’t dropped enough hints, but that you haven’t done enough to scare the reader and the viewpoint character.  But your story is on my “to read” rather than “already read” list so I’m advising blind here.

  Some options:

  \- The villain has a "evildoing" face as well as a "public" one, and the heroes start running into the villain under his "evildoing" face. (Remember Orochimaru going after Sasuke, while still being in disguise as the Kazekage? ) This makes sense if the villain needs to see to critical matters personally. 

  \- Or, just with letters and messengers, the villain starts trying to recruit or convert the hero. After all, the villain is confident in their Eminently Rational cause and worldview, and can Rationally Perceive the hero's potential danger if not converted - or at least diverted. Can the hero use the villain's efforts to uncover the villain's true identity? Or will the hero be corrupted himself by his attempt to play along with this Eminently Rational villain?

  \- The villain's mentor is caught, or even turns himself in, and reveals to us the villain's past and likely plans. Alas, the mentor doesn't know the villain's current face. Learning the enemy's personality, we can start to guess who he might be - will the hero find out for sure in time? \[Silence of the Lambs, and other 'key informant helps detective' plots.\]

  \- Captured records or underlings makes the villain's larger plan apparent, revealing their personality under their "villain alias" even if we don't know their public name.

  \- The villain's bright young lieutenant becomes a "villain protagonist" POV, working against the heroes, following orders from their masked mastermind.

  \- Something happens to change the villain's priorities. New technology shows up; a key ally gets sick or dies; a foreign enemy gets interested sooner than the villain expects; a foreign opportunity opens that's too good to pass up, or that others will seize first if he doesn't. The villain gives up some secrecy versus the hero, starts accepting mistakes in disguise, in order to fight well on this "second front."

  \- The villain openly reveals himself in some way! But what is his plan? Why did he come into the open? Can we figure out his true intention before it's too late?

  \- We've figured out who the villain is, but we can't get anybody to believe us! Everyone else seems to be blackmailed or manipulated. How can we get enough proof to convince everyone else, before the villain decides we ourselves are too dangerous to let live? \[Many 'palace intrigue' plots.\]

    I set out first and foremost to write a good story, the rationality part comes second. The mystery part is not \*essential\*, but I do very much like the challenge of writing a story about a villain who absolutely refuses to cooperate in their own defeat, to the extent that the hero isn't even quite sure they \*exist\*. I've never really seen that done well, which is part of why I wanted to give it a try.

  What I find this genre sometimes lacks is that while rationality involves thinking things through and not holding the idiot ball, humans by default can make mistakes, or sometimes there's simply no perfect, right answer. Unfortunately, a lot of people assume a rational character is always a genius that is aware of all the facts and can always find the correct action or choice - which is rather the opposite, as a true rational character must accept irrational events and work around them, if it's lack of information, other characters not working in their best interests, a past mistake that is now undoable, or even simply failure to follow through; it's one thing to know what you need to do, and another to actually do it.

  You can have a villain perfectly adhering to rational nature while picking an unfavorable choice, either due to a reasonable mistake that led to that decision, or because at the time of choosing there was no way to tell which choice would have been better, and now he's paying for that.

  Just an amateur spit-balling here, but I do have some knowledge of Naruto, so I'll try my best.

  I think I know who the villain might be (at least, if your story is anything like canon), but ignoring that ,try this: Have the villain be surprised by the increasing escalation of power, and need to scramble to adjust their plans to it, and so mess up. It could even be a commentary on what it was like growing up watching Naruto.

  In the beginning, when we all started watching the anime, demon hosts were the height of pure power, and most fights were won by trickery. The old 'strongest man on Earth' was literally just a guy who was really fast. No explosions, no chakra nukes, no nothing; all we really knew about him was that he was really quick and that, given this was a world of ninja, that made him over-powered. And even that was just a trick he invented, instead of anything innate. That's the world you seem to have established in NTBS. That's the world this rational villain seems to have been operating in for their entire lifetime. 

  And then gradually, over the course of the series the power levels keep on rising and rising, beyond what was established in the initial world building, until the point where, when I came back to the show after a three year break, it seemed ridiculous. When I watched, a bad guy would throw a knife at a main character, and they would dodge by jumping away. Now, people are throwing giant chakra bombs around, and people are dodging by *temporarily leaving the physical universe, or by temporarily establishing control of reality* (I still firmly believe the canon Sharingan is just bullshit).

  You could have your villain be just as surprised by that, as we were. Have them be shocked by what appears to be a systemic change in the world they've spent their entire lives operating in, where demigods and reincarnation and giant chakra trees exist. You could have them mess up by ruling something out as 'impossible' in their planning (because it truly used to be impossible), and then have it happen. Give them a real, vital reason to go out into the world and collect information themselves, because they're the only one in their organization powerful/stealthy to spy on some of the new, incredibly powerful actors without getting caught, and you can't make plans without accurate information. For example, it takes series skill to be able to spy on Pain in canon. Even Jiraiya, the Leaf's literal spy master (though that might be fanon) couldn't manage it. Rumors that the Rain Village has acquired a literal god as a ruler, and all the spies coming back empty-handed, could be motivation enough for the mastermind to get of their butt and go investigate personally, if Rain is somehow that important to their plans. That is, of course, assuming Pain isn't the mastermind.

  Essentially just have the evil mastermind be just as surprised by the never-ending power-scaling as we were, so that them having to think on their feet and make mistakes becomes rational. The world of Naruto undergoes some pretty serious change in just a few short years in canon (from low level ninja fights to literal cosmic beings descending from the heavens to start the apocalypse); have the mastermind be just as swept up in that as everyone else.

    I like the idea of the villain panicking about the world changing around them, but my preferred solution to the power creep in canon is to just not have it in NTBS. Solving problems by casting a bigger Rasengan is just lazy writing, IMO, and to drive that home Naruto never even learns the Rasengan in this story. The villain is the same way: It's not their sheer power that's scary, but their intelligence what makes them a threat. Now they can certainly be worried about new techniques being invented, but a rational villain wouldn't be concerned about a bigger version of the fireball technique: They'd be afraid of someone inventing a reality-reading, truth seeking spell or something along those lines.

  (I haven't read your story yet, so apologies if it doesn't fit. I'd just tell you what I would do.)

  To have a good murder mystery, you have to commit murder.

  Readers aren't usually as deeply invested in the story as the writer is, so you can't rely on subtle hints to make them curious. To make the reader care about the identity of the villain, you have to make him a threat. Pull on the emotional heartstrings of the reader.

  My suggestion would be to have the villain attack a character, directly or indirectly. The character has no means of protection, outside of figuring out who the attacker is and stopping him. Now it's a race against the clock. Maybe they find the "villain," but some of the hero team think they have the wrong person. Now they're arguing over it, and the clock is still ticking down.

  The villain could have even set this entire thing up just to distract them, so he could easily perform both a power play and a tactical move all at once. There will definitely be a lot or ruminating and speculating about who the villain is, some researching that lands some people in watery graves, and a general heightened sense of "what the heck is going on?"

  Hit the heroes hard, and leave them scrambling. I think that's the best way to make a reader care.
  ```

  I can answer from a story perspective, however the "rational" sub genre often enjoys reversing story rules to better show their characters intelligence so take this with as many grains of salt as you wish. Personally, I don't see good story and good strategy mutually exclusive so here it goes:

  A good antagonist is the antithesis of the hero.

  By this I mean that if batman represents order, the joker must represent chaos; MoRHarry represents humanism then RVoldemort  represents an apathy toward humanity; etc.

  -- the main character and the antagonistic force must be at odds.

  The second key ingredient to a good villain is that they must desire the same thing as the protagonist. 

  Whether for fame, that special guy, or the mcguffin the protagonist and antagonist must be after the same thing to bring them again and again into conflict.

  This, I feel, is where I would like to see more. Naruto is realized that the need to grow stronger will not be enough, yet he still cares for things enough to continue its pursuit. I can't yet point to a strong thesis for him. Similarly, I can't point to the strong antithesis of that. I'm also not sure what they're fighting over, just a vague and terrifying arms race.

  The world you've made is fantastic- with terrifying foes and uncertainty everywhere. But on this I think there should be certainty: what the protagonist wants (and thereby define what the antagonist wants).
  ```

  - u/Sophronius:
    ```
    You make some great points, thank you. I definitely need to focus more on giving Naruto some concrete answers to the central (philosophical) problem he is facing, and highlight the contrast with those who disagree. That should help a lot.
    ```

  It sounds like you want a rational villain.

  &#x200B;

  So the commit the murder in the first place, something was interfering with his rationality (eg: being drugged or drunk ....) or committing the murder was done to avoid some greater harm.

  &#x200B;

  Lots of detective stories are "follow the money," or more generally qui benefacit animae (who benefits).

  &#x200B;

  Could we have the "villain" be killing the person for a very good reason that is not initially known to the reader and as we go further through the book we are exposed to many good, but not good enough, reasons and ultimately find the actual motive?

  Disclaimer: Not an author (yet), nor have I read your story (though I want to). At the same time, I read constantly, and the expert fears the clueless beginner (or something).

  1. There's a new villain in town, and he's an arrogant fuckwit making cliche movie mistakes. New guy is a) hired by the main villain as a proxy but it was a mistake, b) a new independent villain making too much noise. New guy gets silenced while the hero is investigating, leaving him baffled by the uncharacteristic silence. If we're going with A, then there's probably going to be several more new guys for that kind of mistake to slip through. Main villain might be branching out or suddenly needing the extra work. Problem: this might cause viewers to feel cheated about the new guy's sudden semi-explained death.
  2. Write from the PoV of someone in partial or constant contact with the villain but isn't told anything, such as a maid. They'll pick up a few things, but ultimately have no idea of what is going on. Merging these obscure details with the protagonist's obscure details could lead to the audience having slightly less obscure details.
  3. Write a chapter from the PoV of the main villain in an entirely new language unknown to humanity. Never explain it to anyone, to the extent that it will never be fully solved even centuries after your death. What little they somehow figure out can be cleverly utilized by you as intentional foreshadowing.

  One way, if it's purely for some dramatic tension to pull the reader's attention to the bad guy, would be to have a quick flash-back (or flash-sideways, whatever) to a scene where the vilain is plotting, or acting on, or even just thinking about his actions. Show us that he really is being rational by going over things from his perspective (or her perspective). You don't need to describe who they are, or even spend a lot of time on it, just show some of the thought process in a paragraph or two before getting back to the main story.

  (I might be way off because I haven't started reading your story yet, but that's one way to do it.)

  Se7en and Glass and other similar stories put the villain close to the hero, with various motivations to help the hero grow while also still being the bad guy in the background.

  ```
  Just a suggestion given before I go further than the first chapter - would expanding the main villain's influence to the main character's close associates work? For example, for the main villain to have some quality or conviction that can probably be attributed to them, drawing in and/or subverting the MC's friend, little by little, whether by intent or by accident, until before they know it they and the MC are on opposite sides of some issue, and the MC only realizes this hypothetical villain's influence in hindsight?

  In The Fifth Element, Dallas and Zorg are never on screen together and never interact. Depending on what kind of story you're trying to tell, it might be an interesting experiment to explore that model.
  ```

- u/ajuc:
  ```
  Maybe try to write a disposable chapter from the villain POV? What he does, internal monologue, who he meets.

  Then you will know him/her better and have more indirect interactions to put into the real story from heroes' POV.

  Idly thinking \[Edit:  Or rather, idly rambling\]:

  &#x200B;

  Where there is power of life-and-death, there narratively needs to be a higher priority not to make use of it.  This could be 'The protagonist's blood or other MacGuffin is key to my plot, and my plot is more important to me than my risk of death!  The world in my image, or nothing!', or it could be 'Argh, I know who and where the antagonist is, but I don't know where he's keeping the hostages that I would become the enemy of the world to protect, or who have vital/knowledge/powers/\[MacGuffin\] for my own desired future of the world!', or it could be 'Argh, I know who and where the antagonist is, but if I bungle the capture then the killswitch will go off and the whole planet will be exploded!' or similar...

  &#x200B;

  The other side of that is a Kira/L situation, where both sides are protecting themselves through anonymity, and neither knows who is the one working against them.  Of course, both could have seemingly-unrelated public personas, maybe even ones which have directly interacted (depending on the personal risk estimated by the characters), but for your preferences perhaps not directly leaving messages for each other.  Here, both sides would be trying to use the *changes* made by the other to trace back their mode of operation and originating motivations-and-identity.  (Start with 'dunwhat', guess at the 'whydunnit', trace back the 'howdunnit' to get the 'whodunnit' while being informed about guesses about the 'whydunnit'...)

  &#x200B;

  Keep in mind that there can be multiple levels, in that the protagonist can be in the power of the antagonist, and try to be worth more to the antagonist alive than dead, but *also* taking more secretive actions which would get the protagonist killed if the antagonist ever realised what they were doing.  Likewise with the antagonist--you can have a situation where the antagonist is in the protagonist's power and grudgingly cooperating with the protagonist against a third party that they're both most-strongly opposed to, but have the whole thing be the antagonist manipulating things behind the scenes, and even deliberately leaving the protagonist alive so that people who trust the protagonist aren't worried about the antagonist, and then you can have /another/ level in which the protagonist is watching all of this and pretending to be taken in while he lets the antagonist either contact all the people he needs (to be arrested in one huge sweep) or otherwise arrange MacGuffins in a way favourable for the protagonist's ends...

  &#x200B;

  That last case, with multiple levels, is very fun to imagine but could be tricky to implement--you'd have to be very clear in portraying the multiple levels for at least one of the characters, such as showing what the protagonist is thinking about what the antagonist's truly thinking while the protagonist is talking with the antagonist and pretending to be taken in, and the antagonist is also talking on the surface level...  it's fairly uninteresting if you're in a Watson position and have twist sprung on you one after another without getting to follow the thought process, and it's also fairly uninteresting if you know both sides' thoughts on all levels and there's no suspense or surprise about which one 'has the upper hand' at any given moment, but perhaps you could do a balance where each person's two-/multiple-levels of thought are phrased ambiguously enough that it's not clear to the reader which person's specifics are correct.  That could be unsatisfying, though.

  &#x200B;

  Ultimately, the 'neither side knows the other' is most satisfying for me to imagine (if I had to choose), rather than the surface-and-hidden thoughts of Kira talking with L in person.  The chill that you feel when you notice things that have been done--(from a protagonist's perspective) you expected an organisation to do a certain thing, or the police to handle something in a certain way, or *something* to happen according to your predictions, and it's...  different.  Surprise, disconcertion, at some point the realisation that the most likely possibility is that someone with some measure of power is doing this for their own unknown goals while keeping themselves in the darkness, and the question being *what are you going to do about it* and how can you do so safely...

  &#x200B;

  Hmm.  I'm thinking now about how the ending can be satisfying rather than unsatisfying.  Too much focus on unmasking the public persona of the antagonist feels as though it would be anticlimactic--'Successfully trapping and seizing the Ghost Mafia Boss who's been puppeteering everything until we mapped out his methods' sounds more satisfying than 'And the TRUE identity of the Ghost Mafia Boss was--unassuming janitor Old Man Giggers!'.  In that sense, you don't even have to have the public persona be a known character:  once you seize the antagonist, known by the antagonist's actions and plots throughout the fiction, you could have a note in the epilogue about what the antagonist's name and formative years were found out to be like in wrap-up investigations, or else told directly to the protagonist in an effort to convince the protagonist to *change their mind* (which could also start a sequel, in which the former protagonist is actually convinced by the antagonist, and starts working against people on their own former side to try to undo the damage they did in the first fiction...).

  &#x200B;

  Thinking about HPMOR, with faded memories, the impression strikes me that Harry seemed to spend a lot more time reacting rather than acting--he had an understanding that there was a mysterious enemy, and he had doubts about whether it was Voldemort or not, but most of what he did was trying to build stronger defenses against attack without reaching out and trying to work out how to (trace back and) get to his enemy.  In this respect, Dumbledore did better--he at least set a trap, such that the enemy would definitely go the trap, definitely be trapped by the trap (averted), and *whoever* it was be known to be the enemy by that they came to the trap to be trapped.  (Pretty much, that is.)

  &#x200B;

  Hmmm, returning to your original wording.  Yes, in summary, rather than speculating about who the known-persona might be (if any known-persona at all), without the known-persona necessarily being at all important (and ideally it wouldn't be, as if your public persona is critical for your plots then you have a bullseye painted on you for both public and private enemies), arguably more worthwhile to have the Kira approach of where the protagonist/detective makes up a moniker for the antagonist and tries to either trace back their methods/(loose ends) or catch them based on their derived motivations/plans, or both.

  &#x200B;

  ...continuing to ponder...  for murder mysteries with finite characters, the antagonist being a known character is pretty much Knox's First Commandment, this presumably gets weaker if dealing with large cities and if it would be foolish or otherwise improbable for the antagonist to come into close contact with the protagonist--ah, though it could be fun if two people have a special shared history or shared qualities, and then it's later a shock to them both that they were each other's nemeses.  Easy to guess by readers, though, if the foreshadowing is clear enough to be meaningful.

  &#x200B;

  ....not a matter of 'it turns out the Ghost Mafia Boss was actually janitor Giggers all along' but 'it turns out janitor Giggers was actually the Ghost Mafia Boss all along'...  argh, how to frame the thoughts...

  &#x200B;
