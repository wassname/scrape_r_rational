## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  his name comes up often enough on this sub, but I recently blew through all of [Ted Chiang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Chiang)'s short stories for the first time and wanted to renew the recommendation for people who haven't seen them yet. I didn't care much for the movie *Arrival*, and was pleasantly surprised to find that the original short story ("Story of Your Life") was much more focused and soulful. His stories posit fantastical premises and follow them through to their logical conclusions, but more than that, they are constructed in ways that meld together seemingly-disparate themes and ideas in astonishing ways. All of his major works are collected across two books - *Stories of Your Life and Others* (republished just as *Arrival*) and *Exhalation: Stories* \- but you can track most/all of them down with a quick Google. I don't think any of his stories are bad, but many are fairly insubstantial; of his longer stuff I most enjoyed:

  * "The Lifecycle of Software Objects" - parenting and learning are big themes in Chiang's work (see also "Exhalation", "Dacey's Patent Automatic Nanny", "Understand"), but this story might do the best job of exploring them? Also interesting discussion of AI and software development, but there's loads more going on here besides
  * "Hell is the Absence of God" - a modern-day horror retelling of the Book of Job. Lots of Chiang's stuff kinda reminds me of *Unsong* \- see also "The Merchant and the Alchemist's Gate" and "Tower of Babylon"

    >  I didn't care much for the movie Arrival, and was pleasantly surprised to find that the original short story ("Story of Your Life") was much more focused and soulful. 

    I would like Arrival so much more if it didn't completely conclude on literally the antithesis of Story of Your Life. I read the book before watching the film and as it progressed I was getting more and more confused. 

    >!The book concludes that there is no such thing as free will. This is emphasised because the daughter's death in the book is a random event that could easily be stopped not some genetic disease. In the movie they say free will exists but having nice memories with a daughter is worth the pain and emphasises her choice to have a kid.!<
    ```

    - u/The_Wadapan:
      ```
      I think you're right about the >!random event being more compelling than disease!<, but would question whether the "thesis" of the short story is that >!free will doesn't exist!<. One of the last lines is ">!From the beginning I knew my destination, and I chose my route accordingly!<", and if you look at Chiang's later works concerned with the topic (>!"The Merchant and the Alchemist's Gate", "What's Expected of Us" and "Anxiety is the Dizziness of Freedom"!<) I think you get the impression that he believes very strongly in the idea of >!choice even in deterministic paradigms!<. From the commentary of "Merchant": ">!I wanted to try writing a time-travel story where the inability to \[change the past\] wasn't necessarily a cause for sadness. \[...\] acceptance of fate is one of the basic articles of faith in Islam.!<"
      ```

      - u/RMcD94:
        ```
        >!I haven't read his other works but your quote is exactly in line with what I intended. She chose her route to match what she saw. The important word is "accordingly". She was incapable of choosing other than the future. This is mentioned a number of times as I remember. I am definitely not suggesting that it didn't feel like a choice, otherwise she would just save her daughter. Maybe if you want to get in some semantics about free will but either way I think it was clear from the book that it is a deterministic universe (ignoring how seeing into the future wouldn't work if there were branching timelines anyway) and that everything happens at once, time is just another dimension. No more can you teleport from one spot to another or walk one way and arrive in another place can you change time. Any other explanation doesn't make sense with the actions of the aliens either. Choice must not actually exist for the alien plot of the book to work.  I don't want to get into a semantic argument about free will and compatibilism, suffice to say by "free will" I mean determinism, and the movie does not focus on the acceptance of the determinism of the universe but instead as I said suggests that the universe is not deterministic and that she could have chosen differently!<

        Nothing that's got the same "hard science to magic" vibe, no.
        Stuff that's related-ish:

        * RoyalRoad:
         * "I Am Going To Die (In This Game-Like Dimension)" - has the main character actively experimenting with the weird mechanics of how the "Lavi" and "Qi" work, but doesn't have the mundane-earth-science side.
         * "Cultivating Earth" (on hiatus) - an ancient Cultivator decides to set up a sect on Earth because it's a planet that's developed civilisation without Qi due to his actions. Very well written and I'm still hoping it starts up again.
         * "Eight" - has the MC applying their skills at woodscraft and knowledge about spiritual matters they'd learned from their family, rather than science.
        * Sufficient Velocity:
         * "Marked for Death" - inbetween attempting mostly successfully to survive in a rationalised version of Naruto (which is a horrifying deathworld), the quest-avatar character attempts to Do Science to chakra and seals. (With mixed results.)
        * Fanfiction.net
         * https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12863641/1/The-Optimised-Wish-Project Rationalised DBZ - I'm not particularly a fan of the setting, so I've stopped following this one, but it does fit
        * Other
         * Ra, by qntm (https://qntm.org/ra) - "Discovered in the 1970s, magic is now a bona fide field of engineering. There's magic in heavy industry and magic in your home. It's what's next after electricity." Hard magic-sci-fi.
         * Saga of Soul (http://www.sagaofsoul.com/) - "The story begins when Eriko, an introverted bookworm, suffers a near-death experience. Instead of walking toward the Light, she takes it upon herself to perform scientific experiments, which leads to her acquiring magical powers."
        ```

        There's also [Plasticity](https://archiveofourown.org/works/16017161/chapters/37377839) where the SI is a undergrad bio major who gets dropped into the setting of Naruto. Unfortunately for your request, there's only a little science in it, but what's there is accurate.

      I didn't like how the author was clearly not a doctor and used television medicine logic at times. I think I stopped reading when they had the main character decide to bash someone in the head  until they were unconscious to induce amnesia...
      ```

      - u/PrecariousBridge:
        ```
        My context can be off, but retrograde and anterograde amnesia are very common with traumatic brain injuries. Although typically only a few minutes of memories around the event disappear, that can escalate depending on the severity of the damage. The victim doesn't have to be unconscious either. Sometimes people recall what happened right after the concussion, but forget shortly afterward.

        Though I do have to say, it's not a guaranteed outcome.

          Yeah. If I remember correctly, it was the only choice he could make other than killing the guy, seeing as at that point in time he was a hobo working for a crime lord. I'm not too versed up on biology, so I can't comment on the correctness of the biology the protagonist uses later on >!when he tries to make a cure for that plague by attacking different strains of bacteria,!< but from my cursory searches on google they seemed alright.

    The [Conrad Stargard Series](https://www.goodreads.com/series/43333-conrad-stargard) has this. It's an uplift fic where an american engineer is transported to 13th century Poland, a decade or so before the mongol invasion, which he prepares for by uplifting poland into the industrial age. 

    The caveat is that it starts moderately chauvinistic and weird, and gets more so with every installment. If you can get past that the first 3-4 books are decent enough.

    Another one is the [Destiny's Crucible](https://www.goodreads.com/series/215776-destiny-s-crucible) series where a chemist is transported to a small island on another world that's getting invaded by a large, powerful empire. Their tech is around 17-18th century.

    Dr. Stone is the story of how due to an unexplained incident, everyone on earth turns to stone, but then 3700 years later a genius is revived, and works out that he was revived due to bat guano dripping on him over the years, so he begins making nitric acid to try to revive more people, and restart civilization within his lifetime. Unfortunately, one of the first people he revives is a violent but not dumb anarcho primitivist, who wants to stop civilization from returning using his own revived society. This conflict only spans the first third of the current chapters, and I won't spoil the rest.

      Are the books better than the anime? Because I watched the anime, and while it's similar to IBBFW, it's far from rational. A real person in that situation would mess up *way* more than Senku, wouldn't have an eidetic memory, and would probably go insane from >!getting stuck in a rock for 3,700 years while fully conscious!<.

      It also treated science as a religion, often having it's characters preach the virtues of "believing in science".
      ```

      - u/lsparrish:
        ```
        I loved the anime, but that was admittedly with consciously making some allowances for the fact that it's trying to be a fun adventure story (and pro-science propaganda) for young kids, basically copying battle manga/anime like Naruto and so on but making science the focus instead of battle. So I kind of have to agree with your criticism here as far as realism goes.

        The bad guy is unrealistically strong, Senku unrealistically smart, devices tend to work unrealistically well, inspirational speeches tend to meet wide-eyed acceptance, etc., often just simply because it's that kind of story. But at the same time, it's a researched story, and conveys believable/true scientific concepts in terms of tech dependencies, and also pays good attention to things like continuity and character growth.

I've also heard good things about his latest story Pale.

    By and large nearly all the ones I'm aware of are HFY-style awesome-things-we-take-for-granted porn - fun, but not exactly r/rational material (if you want some of those, I can certainly make a list :) ). I love that kind of setting almost as much as time travel though (and there is some overlap), so gonna +1 the heck out of the question in the hope others know things I've not encountered.

    Charles Stross plays in this space quite a bit, and has the least frivolous takes I can think of, though this is not a strong statement. The Family Trade series has quite a few characters going both ways between medieval/fantasy and modern worlds. The Nightmare Stacks, from his Laundry series, has a POV fantasy character cross over to modern Britain, and follows that up with a full scale invasion - you don't need to have read the previous books in the series to enjoy this one.

    The Strugatsky brothers have some uniquely depressing takes adjacent to this; [The Kid from Hell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kid_from_Hell) is probably the closest.

    EDIT: Neal Stephenson's The Rise and Fall of D.O.D.O also has some of this.
    ```

  - u/jtolmar:
    ```
    Not really rational, but The Devil Is A Part Timer is an anime about fantasy universe stock characters getting portaled into Tokyo and getting part-time jobs. It derives a lot of its humor from characters handling this sort of thing like responsible adults, which should have some overlap with the tastes around here.
    ```

  - u/Badewell:
    ```
    Not something I would necessarily recommend, but [Re:Creators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Re:Creators) has several fictional characters being isekaied into the real world.
    ```

    - u/sl236:
      ```
      Re:Creators is actually pretty fun just for the concept: the characters from various fictional hellworlds come to our world, and they have a few things they'd like to discuss with their authors.

      On that note, Cop Craft also has fantasy-character-in-modern-world, although I wouldn't recommend it for any other reason or indeed suggest watching more than an episode since the storytelling falls apart completely later.

      Hataraku Maou-Sama, on the other hand, although it's straight up comedy, has surprisingly good pacing and even worldbuilding.
      ```

  - u/pldl:
    ```
    Note: basically none of these are rational. Rational adjacent at best.
    You can try searching for "reverse isekai". 

    Devil is a Part Timer, Jahy-sama wa Kujikenai! are two comedy ones.

    As for litrpg that takes place in our world, there are many litrpgs that take place in the modern setting post-apocalypse or in the modern world with a hidden magic/paranormal side (I am including VRMMORPGS in this category).

    For ones that are strictly modern setting but with minimal paranormal stuff, I can't really think of any that aren't MC gets a system that helps them git gud at one specific job. Sometimes there's time travel. 

    Crazy Detective (Pretty ridiculous through and through; Barely even tries to explain itself. The only of the garbage novels I actually kept on reading, but that's because I like crime novels in general) 

    God of Music  (haven't read)

    God of Crime (Fun concept, bad ending)

    Top Management (haven't read)

    God of Cooking (Cooking tournament arcs :D) 

    Gourmet Food Supplier (Falls off really fast)

    God of Tennis (Barely translated)

  - u/Revlar:
    ```
    Bokura no Kiseki is this, in a sense. It's not really a gender bender, despite the fact the MC is reincarnated princess from a fantasy kingdom. Reincarnated character have two sets of memories and struggle with that, so it's not a clear cut isekai, but it is enjoyable and the whodunnit-with-magic-experiments lets it be rational to a degree.

  [A Young Woman's Political Record](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-young-womans-political-record-youjo-senki-saga-of-tanya-the-evil.660569/) is a Youjo Senki AU fanfic that has been recommended here before, but I'm writing this to let people know that it's finished. The plot is that the mostly-rational main character of the magitech WW1 anime enters politics following a moderately worse version of canon (ie, like actual WW1) and succeeds *Springtime for Hitler* style. There are minor issues with the worldbuilding that most people (not having any experience in national politics or international diplomacy outside of strategy video games, a couple whiggish biographies and some movies) will not notice and the small cast of characters are written very well. At present the epilogue has yet to be posted, but the author's rationale that the story must end because the lead has won and is no longer an outsider to the establishment is valid. 4/5

  I would also like to recommend the excellent animated films of multiple oscar-nominee Don Hertzfeldt and his associates. All but his three feature-length works are on youtube and they display an excellent concern for the open psychological and existential questions concerning human mortality, with the three feature length works critically examining the question of identity with respect to transhumanism. 5/5

  Finally, I recommend the pre-canon Naruto fanfic [Compass of thy soul](https://fanfiction.net/s/13338339/1) and it's sequel, [Direct thee to peace](https://fanfiction.net/s/13388642/1/Direct-thee-to-Peace), which finished last week. It is a capably written story about the rigors of internecine warfare on the military families in the setting, and the author has clearly researched the living conditions of pre-unification Japan. The sequel drops the ball to become a moderately hammy story about a family of patriarchs and scions coming to blows over their differences but it remains engaging and the cast are mostly rational even if breaks SoD on the nature of civil and military governance. 4/5

    As to YWPR, it's clear the author was sick of the story and just wanted it done with. The story was always tricky in terms of structure what with the central conceit being Tanya having no antagonist and very low stakes, so I don't blame him at all, but I remain disappointed as I became very invested in the story.
    ```

    - u/Flashbunny:
      ```
      They made a follow-up post explaining how the story had reached a point where it was no longer really about Tanya misconstruing things to unexpected success, but just what anyone with future knowledge could accomplish in that situation.
      ```

      - u/GlueBoy:
        ```
        That's just bad writing, though, not something that's out of his control.

        Given that he's a pretty good writer, I think if he hadn't felt rushed by his obligation to patreon and browbeaten by spacebattles, he could have figured a better plot for the the third 'book'. Maybe an inversion of the conceit of the first two books, e.g. she tries to succeed and actually fails.

        - u/Nnaelo:

          Sure he could have, but why should he? The ending came out of left field, true, and was as much of disappointment to me as to many people; but as far as the reasons why it came, they are understandable.  


          He has two original stories that are taking off and can be properly monetized, and that are easier to write because there's no OTL to contend with, among other things.  YWPR was great, and I'm sad to see it end, but I'm glad we got an ending at all.

          - u/IICVX:
            ```
            Yeah, the story had gotten to the point where it wasn't really about Tanya any more - to make a story about heads of state you need to have politics, and Tanya managed to fail to fail her way into the position of an unquestioned dictator. 

            If the author was going to continue things he needed to go back and redo the last ten-ish chapters.
            ```

    ```
    I quite liked Compass of thy soul and Direct thee to peace, but upon reflection the stories had super questionable pro-authoritarian politics. On a macro level the duology maintains that royalty is implicitly better than everyone else due to, effectively, the divine right of kings (in this case as expressed by the Uchiha doujutsu), and that everything would have been better if the Senju had just known their place.  

    There was also a bunch of weird Christian stuff in the background - there's very little mention of the Kamis at all but whenever it comes up the MC makes vague references to believing in monotheism still, and the reincarnated MC introduces a bunch of our-world songs to the Uchiha clan, at least one of which is from Veggie Tales. It's fine and mostly stays out of the way, up until like the last couple of paragraphs in DTP, where you're smashed over the head with a literal deathbed conversion. 

    Both stories were good, don't get me wrong, but if you dislike getting ambushed by Christian (or authoritarian) themes in novels you should go into them with your eyes open.

      >but upon reflection the stories had super questionable pro-authoritarian politics.

      Authoritarian ruling power weren't always socially backward. Social progress from feudal conglomerates was toward absolute power of the king. On that stage the kings were often in symbiotic relationship with [Third Estate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estates_of_the_realm#Third_Estate) \- upper and middle strata of commoners, especially with free cities.

      I think the pro-authoritarian slant is a consequence of writing a non-revolutionary in the Naruto setting but I would say that the other themes don't really show up for more than a second before the beginning of the sequel. To me, that seems an unfortunate consequence of the author's biases rather than a deliberate effort to affect the audience, which isn't a dealbreaker. YMMV.

  Book 16 of the Dresden Files series drops tomorrow, so now's as good a time as any to recommend the series. It's about a private detective who is a wizard. I recommend the series for its very large and enjoyable world and the wide breadth of characters, both of which seem to grow with every book. You have interesting fairies (who love making deals), several flavours of vampires, fallen angels, vague Lovecraftian threats slowly coming nearer, vanilla mortal gangsters, wizard politics, holy knights, and all kinds of other fun stuff. Most religions are true to some degree, as well. Not rational*ist*, but most of the time the characters actively and intelligently pursue their goals, and there are some clever plots and traps throughout.

  Downsides: Some readers think the main character is sexist because he doesn't like hurting women and doesn't expect them to betray him or beat him in a fair fight, but I do feel the need to point out that this is a character flaw that actively hurts him again and again, and he gradually learns not to make those mistakes. Also it was the author's first book series, so the first two books are significantly less enjoyable than the rest, but you can easily start with book 3 for vampires or book 4 for fairy politics and not miss much (The author made an effort to make them good entry points)... Or you can power through the first two books if you want. They aren't *bad*, they just aren't great like what comes after.

  The audiobooks are fantastic, as well. Narrated by James Marsters, who played Spike in Buffy the Vampire Slayer.

    Seconding to start on book three.  If you like the series you'll go back to book 1 & 2 some time later to get the details or just read it on a wiki, but starting on books 1 or 2 will make you wonder why it was recommended.  There are significant plot arcs started in book 3 that don't get tied up until book 10 *Changes* or later.

    It's an absolutely great series! It's my personal favorite "scrappy hero" story of all time. I would recommend it to anyone who would enjoy: urban fantasy, close quarters magic combat, or fantasy detective stories.

  Any recommendations for futuristic people getting isekaied, or crash landing, into a fantasy world? Preferably with a focus on them using the technology they brought with them rather than using their knowledge to build things. I read [The Cosmic Interloper](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/31468/the-cosmic-interloper) which is just what I'm looking for, but is incomplete. It has (minor spoilers) >!a paladin attacks the protagonist by summoning a spirit, which they realize is a brain wave like you would see from a scanner being broadcasted. So they record it, then start it up as a simulation on their brain computer and talk to the spirit.!< Also [Fantasy World Epsilon 30-10](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/31129/fantasy-world-epsilon-30-10) which wasn't nearly as good.

    There's a factorio multicrossover called Factory Isolation, where the protagonist is given a dimensional teleporter and access to the Factorio world to scale up his tech and go and uplift other worlds. Another story similar to that is called Cruel to be Kind, which is an SI story but without too much pandering (I think?). Cruel to be Kind follows the author as he uses his dimensional teleporter to go to different worlds to steal their tech and build his own kingdom. They can both be found on Spacebattles.

  Hey guys, I just finished A Thing Of Vikings and I'm looking for something of similar length or longer to read, preferably fantasy, that it's either finished or regularly updated. I've already looked into everything on the tvtropes, the wiki, top web fiction, the first 20 pages of royalroad's active only ranking and the most popular stuff(mostly quests) on sufficient velocity, I haven't really checked spece battles out. If it's a translation I'm only interested if the grammar is at least a 7/10, because I tried reading release that witch and it was impossible. And lastly while I don't mind if it's ff I really couldn't get into the original Worm.

    * Forged Destiny by Coeur Al'aran is a rwby litrpg AU. The world of remnant has levels and classes, which are further separated into castes basically. Jaune is a blacksmith who wants to be a Hero (basically hunters). Really good AU, pretty much a whole new world and cast of characters with the names from rwby. Not that rational but complete and writing quality is pretty good.

    * Ar'Kendrythist and Zombie Knight Saga on Royalroad. They're probably in the first 20 pages in royalroad but if you haven't read either I strongly recommend both.

    * I hear good things about Purple Days, a timeloop story involving Joffrey from GoT. It's also pretty long at around 730k words.

      Thx for answering, I've checked out forged destiny but I kinda didn't like it. However I'm already reading both zombie knight and ar'kendrythist and I'll look into purple days.

  I’ve got two things two recommend today.  TW: Ponies

  **First**, I want to recommend basically everything by **Forthwith**([fanfic](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/3196486/Forthwith16), [fimfic](https://www.fimfiction.net/user/173607/Forthwith/stories)), especially the mlp fanfics [Seeking Power](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/174671/seeking-power ) , [The Moon’s Apprentice] (https://www.fimfiction.net/story/196256/the-moons-apprentice) , and the Code Geass fic [Kallen Stadtfeld, Countess of Britiannia] (https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12870721/1/Kallen-Stadtfeld-Countess-of-Britannia).

  Forthwith’s stories are inspired by HPMOR, often fairly explicitly.  Both the MLP fics have a main character very similar to HJPEV and relationships/strategies that will feel familiar.  Also, as you might imagine, it doesn't take much for Lelouch from Code Geass to be a rationalist.  Overall, the writing is high quality, the plotting is good, and the humor is fun.  The Moon’s Apprentice is complete, Seeking Power was just majorly revised with an eye toward continuation, and the Code Geass Fic updates in batches every few months.  Also, I wouldn't be shocked if the author is on this subreddit, so hello! if that's the case.


  **Second**, I kind of want to recommend the mlp fic [Austraeoh] (https://www.fimfiction.net/story/25966/austraeoh)

  I say kind of because there are some major pros and cons to this fic, which I’ll go through, but it’s just so unique I want to talk about it for a little bit.

  **What is Austraeoh about?**

  Austraeoh is an epic journey.  It is long.  No, really, it’s longer than what you’re thinking.  At almost 3.7 million words it is currently roughly 3 times the length of Worm and about 1.5 times the current length of A Practical Guide to Evil.  It's one of the longest works in the English language.  After a two-year hiatus it just started updating again, so who knows how far there still is to go.  It features a single main character, Rainbow Dash, traveling east, and touches on various companions that join and leave her along the way.  Book 1 is basically a standalone.  Books 2-6 are a set which introduce some wonderful side characters.  Books 7-8 mark a new start, and Book 9 (in progress) continues from book 8, but is clearly a significant break from the previous books.

  **Pros:**

  * Some very interesting plotting.  In particular, the hero/villain plotting and counter plotting toward the end of the eighth book is some of the most unique I’ve read with a final outcome that hits like a freight train.  The villains throughout are compelling and frightening without being copycats of one another.  I'd say most characters behave reasonably, without too many egregious idiot balls, but there are a few.  To be fair, the main character is not known for her intelligence.  I don't recall anything that broke my suspension of disbelief too much, but I have a high tolerance for that type of thing.
  * Fairly fast pace.  Because the main character is constantly traveling, local plot points are brought up and resolved at a reasonable speed.  Overarching points take longer but there is definite development fairly frequently.  It’s certainly not just a meandering mess of hanging plot points that you might fear from it’s length.
  * Characters are a strong point.  They are by and large well rendered and enjoyable.  Rainbow Dash really grows and develops as a person (pony) and in later books that comes into fascinating conflict with who she used to be.  I don’t like original characters as a rule, but the ones in this series really won me over with their diverse voices and unique perspectives.  Good characters do bad things and vice versa, and they grow and learn from the experience.  (One dude is blind but has a magical echo-location device, which obviously isn’t personality based, but is awesome.)
  * Epic scale/stakes.  The series touches on things like ringworlds and cosmic civilizations.  This is more the underlying plot than the main one, so think of it as a bonus rather than the primary reason to read the series.  In addition, the stakes in each conflict Rainbow Dash gets into feel very real.  She doesn’t always win and when she fails there are real consequences for her or for characters she (and the reader) have come to care about.  There are a few emotional farewells, and one in particular at which I shed a tear.

  **Cons:**

  * Writing is idiosyncratic.  I won’t say bad, because it’s not, but it varies widely in level of maturity.  Some of the emotional scenes are incredibly weighty and well written, while some of the humor is crude and goes on for far too long.  Other sections are shockingly dark.  Children get tortured/killed, both on screen and off.  It’s not for the faint of heart, but looking at a chapter at random you wouldn’t guess how dark it can get.  Also, the author uses words that I’ve never seen anywhere else.  They’re immediately intelligible, but somewhat strange.
  * Length.  I said it before, but in all honesty, I’m not sure this series is better than the sum value of the ten or so other books you could read in the meantime.  Fortunately, it’s written in fairly discrete increments, so it’s relatively easy to put down and pick back up.  I am glad I read it, but I can’t imagine rereading it.
  * Unfinished.  The author is writing again, after quite a long time, but there is still clearly quite some ways to go before the end of this journey.  I hope he makes it to the end, but I don’t think even he would guarantee it.

  **Final thoughts:** this is by the author of [Background Pony] (https://www.fimfiction.net/story/19198/background-pony) which I can wholeheartedly recommend and is one of the MLP fandom’s favorite stories. He knows how to write a dramatic and impactful story.  I personally find something deeply satisfying about starting an absurdly long series and having it feel like a worthwhile journey as I slowly work my way through it.  In some ways, odd as it sounds, this series reminds me of the [Malazan Book of the Fallen](https://www.goodreads.com/series/43493-malazan-book-of-the-fallen) (another very good, very long, occasionally very dark series).

  If you're uncertain, I'd say give it at least through book 2.  The first book sets up a lot of things, but the second book is where the world really starts to expand and the secondary characters come into their own.  As I said, it's not for everyone, but I think it might appeal to some of the people on this subreddit.  At the very least, I hope you marvel at the time and energy this one strange person has put into a single story.  

  Also there is (light book 1 spoilers) [fan music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btPA8FFeDLw) and (book 1 spoilers)[animation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18tWAkwuOqc)

    Background Pony is incredibly depressing, one of those “Whenever I find my will to live becoming too strong, I read it” works. I regret reading it and wish I wasn’t reminded it existed.

    I agree with your other recommendations.

      Archive crawlers, please take the above user's words to heart. In my opinion, it's a damn trap. A beautiful, heartwrenching trap. It baits you along with hope, and then twists the knife...

      It's a wonderful story, but you should probably avoid it if you suffer from depression like me.

  [The Beginner's Guide to Magical Site Licensing](http://starterserials.com/active/the-beginners-guide-to-magical-site-licensing/in-which-a-man-with-a-headache-does-a-spell/) has a rational magic system where magic obeys a non-scalar law. The more people who cast a specific spell the weaker it becomes. The archmages are motivated to keep their spells a secret and have developed a version of magical intellectual property law to regulate use of spells. The author has [published](https://smile.amazon.com/Beginners-Guide-Magical-Licensing-ebook/dp/B07NK7GTBS/ref=smi_www_rco2_go_smi_g4368549507?_encoding=UTF8&%2AVersion%2A=1&%2Aentries%2A=0&ie=UTF8) the first book on kindle if you want to support them.

  - u/Judah77:

    Didn't really focus on the magic system or intellectual property aspects, and the antagonist was extremely irrational.  Two main characters, and the author liked to substitute inconclusive action scenes for plot movement.  I finished it but wouldn't recommend in this sub.

    - u/andor3333:

      I thought it was rational because >!the spellmaking technology is suppressed due to an actual reason instead of just being arbitrary or because the protagonist was some sort of magical genius  (The efficient light creation meta-spell is an antimeme because it potentially creates a false vacuum collapse that hasn't been seen yet b/c of the anthropic principle). The magic system does operate under an IP system which makes sense given the rules described, gives special keys to spells to access them, has an entity with all the spells to enforce the compact, and takes steps to catch people who have found the potential antimeme through monopolistic contracts to report new sellers. Animals and plants naturally evolve and cast spells but end up bottlenecked by the non-scalar law so are limited to local areas. People get around the non-scalar law with the communication trick measuring intensity changes in a spell. The villain is moustache twirlingly evil but gets rid of enemies because he doesn't want to teach dozens of new archmages who will then break his monopoly on the technology he makes all his money from after a leak of half of the secret meta-spell online makes it obvious to anyone.!< It definitely isn't on the level of HPMOR or Ra but attempts to take itself seriously as a system and doesn't throw out its own rules for inconsistent reasons.

  I've recently found [Dark Skies](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/32807/dark-skies) to be extremely addicting and enjoyable.

  The POV character figures out life and challenges from a near tabula rasa state. They are both very clever and also intentionally written as lacking in common sense, which I greatly enjoyed. It's a well written perspective which I found scratched my rationalist itches as the MC figures out the world around them.

  The author is very good at what I view as a sort of slow burn intensity. Obstacles are set up for the MC and then you watch over an arc as they figure out the bits and pieces to required to meet the current challenge. YMMV if this is a pacing style you enjoy - it can get rather drawn out and intense. I found it very addicting.

  I wouldn't quite say it meets the bar of being rational, but some of the elements are there. Going by the sidebar, there is definitely focus on intelligent characters solving problems through creative applications of knowledge and resources. Plenty of intellectual payoff so far too.

  On the non-rational side, worldbuilding is hit and miss. A lot of thought goes into many pieces of it, but at the same time some others feel like they were initially tacked on for the convenience of the current plot with acceptable but not great explanations later (one example: a species of small animals that can climb trees for a clear and pronounced benefit, but don't 'because they are too stupid to realize this'). The same is true for apparent goals and motives. Sometimes side character actions seem a little plot motivated, although mostly the motivations are well fleshed out.

  Overall, I'd still recommend the fiction as a highly enjoyable read - especially for those that enjoy rationalist characters - although it falls somewhat short of the bar to be fully considered rational.

  Some books I read a couple of hundred words and I can't put it down, and will read for hours at a time rather than do so. (Luminosity, Hunger Games, The Martian, The Handmaid's Tale to name a few of the most marked). I want to read them a second, third, fourth, eleventh time just for the pleasure of having my eyes so blessed.

  Some books I read, but I have to put effort in to make the time, and overall I enjoy them, but it's a very different experience to the above. (Like right now I'm reading The Long Dark Teatime of the Soul, which falls into that category). 

  So, uh, do people tend to only read books in the first category? Am I wasting my time by reading too many books in the second? Do people have heuristics they use to choose books? Or do they just download Kindle samples with reckless abandon and if they're swept up happily buy the full article? 

  Oh, and since this *is* the recommendation thread, what are books that fall into the first category for you?
  ```

  - u/BavarianBarbarian_:
    ```
    If I've paid money for a book, I usually force myself through rough patches, but if it's just something I found on the internet one day and bookmarked it, I won't make myself continue reading it if I don't enjoy it. Sunk cost fallacy, probably.
    ```

  - u/ironistkraken:
    ```
    I read books in the first category, but that's because I find that once I get reading I don't really stop until some other stimulus is imposed upon me.  The only reason I cant read something is that, 1 its really bad, like really really bad. 2 that I get angry at the situation or embarrassed for the MC. So when like in Rom com an easily avoided misunderstanding is happening I can't stand it.  A more rational example is when in Pokemon OOS in chapter 58 >!they aren't listening to professionals and I am currently stuck and can't go further because I just know something bad is gonna happen to them!<.

        You also may be interested in FanFicFare. It's a free and open source program that most people use as a Calibre plugin. It's extremely configurable and will create clean and consistent ebooks from pretty much any website you can think of, and a ton that you can't. 

        It also can be used to track updates so you don't need to manually check these things.
