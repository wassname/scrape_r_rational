  Two recent reads:

  *How to Invent Everything* by Ryan North is a book that largely concerns itself with telling time travelers how to rebuild civilization. I think it's a great resource for anyone wanting to write uplift fiction, portal fantasy, or similar, largely because it lays out, in simple terms, the low-hanging fruit for various time periods and levels of technological development.

  *The Labyrinth Index* by Charles Stross is the 9th installment in the Laundry Files series, and you'd probably not want to start with it. I'm only about halfway done, so won't be able to give a full review, but *so far* it's one of my favorites, in part because the series has progressed to the point where >!CASE NIGHTMARE GREEN!< is in full effect (which is ridiculous, and I love it). I've also said in the past that Stross is one of those authors that occasionally dips into full-on rational fiction, which is one of the things that I like about him.
  ```

    I read through the Laundry Files this summer, and while I certainly thought they were very good, they were also really emotionally draining. The setting has progressed from grimdark to shitdark in tone; it honestly kind of reminded me of Wildbow in the last few books, with the degree to which the mood and tone just became *oppressive*.

    This is not a value judgment: many people are fine with, or even actively like, that style. I am just reporting on my experience so that people can calibrate accordingly.
    ```

    - u/JohnKeel:
      ```
      Have you read *Labyrinth Index*? IMO, the series is actually back to trending upwards in terms of brightness - although that's not so hard given how dark it got.
      ```

      - u/alexanderwales:
        ```
        Having finished it, I generally agree, though I think it's important to distinguish between *setting* darkness and *character* darkness. A lot of what made some of the more recent books in the series dark was that bad things were happening to our viewpoint characters, and these weren't the sorts of bad things that a typical protagonist goes through at the nadir of their plot arc, they were bad things that stuck around, including the deaths of important people, permanent manglings of characters, institutional issues, etc.

        In *Labyrinth Index*, we end on >!a personal high note for Mhari, which softens the fact that the world has gotten worse.!< That comes along with >!hints at Extended Continuity Operations as a potential way to preserve humanity and, if not win, then at least maintain some semblance of civilization.!<
        ```

        - u/N0_B1g_De4l:
          ```
          I don't really think it's supposed to be a personal high note, or at least not an unambiguous one. Yes, >!Jim is alive, and no longer staring down the short end of dementia and death but he's also a PHANG, which leaves him complicit in the New Management's policies!<. Also, >!definitely Derek, and possibly Pete (if he does actually kill himself rather than live with PHANG) are dead -- the latter will likely hit Bob hard next time we get his POV, as he was the one who got Pete involved to begin with!<.

          And while there are a few spots of light at the setting level, don't forget >!the New Management's plans for England, which include a conquest of the continent under the leadership of a vampire priesthood!<. Plus, there are a couple of other threats mentioned that have yet to make their moves. Chernabog is listed among the Elder Gods on the Black Chamber PowerPoint and unlike the rest of them he has yet to make a move (and he's listed as working with the KGB, who are due for another appearance), while >!the Mandate's comment to Cthulhu about the "Cold Ones" that suggests that the series might be due for another appearance of the Infovores, possibly as a bookend for the final conflict!<.

          There's maybe *marginally* more hope at this point then there was at the end of the last book, but we're still at the point where victory means "maybe after things shake out something exists that still remembers being human".
          ```

          - u/alexanderwales:
            ```
            Oh, it's definitely ambiguous, and things are definitely grim, but I do think that it's an attempt to >!end "up" rather than "down".!< The last note that a book leaves you on is, in my opinion, rather telling. It also stands in direct contrast to whichever book ended with >!a divorce/separation,!< which I assume was deliberate.
            ```

  I would like to recommend Forge of Destiny. 

  It's a xianxia quest on Sufficient Velocity about a street girl in an original world who joins a Sect and her search for power and friendship.

  The work has everything that is awesome about xianxia without most of the crap that makes 95% of the stories in the genre feel like enthusiastically fellating a cheese grater.

  Most importantly, the characters behave like people instead of merely being ambulatory anuses.

  The first book of the story is finished and the second is supposed to start at some point in the next couple of weeks.

  If you want to try it, here's the link:

  https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/forge-of-destiny-xianxia-quest.35583/

  (Sorry for the awkward format, I'm on the phone right now.)

    ```
    There seems to be a rewrite happening over at Royal Road. https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21188/forge-of-destiny/chapter/301255/smelting-1
    How does the rewrite compare so far with the original quest? Would you recommend waiting? Really enjoying the story so far..
    ```

    - u/Abpraestigio:
      ```
      Can't really say much about the quality of the rewrite. I just finished binging the quest itself, so the subject is still too fresh in my mind to enjoy reading it again.

      &#x200B;

      That said, the quest text has a problem with using "it's" instead of "its". If that is sufficiently annoying to you then you might prefer to read the edited and reworked version on RoyalRoad.

      &#x200B;

      Additionally, the author has said that he is going to include bonus chapters on RR, which is content that wasn't part of the quest, so that's another point in favor.

      &#x200B;

      On the other hand: The story is more than 600k words long. If you want to wait and read it on RR, then you are probably going to be waiting for a very long time.
      ```

  - u/Aretii:
    ```
    For xianxia-calibration purposes: Have you read the Cradle books by Will Wight? If so, could you compare this with them?
    ```

    - u/GlueBoy:
      ```
      I've read both. The worldbuilding and setting is better in Forge of Destiny, but it doesn't explore it much, and it has far inferior characterization. 

      The best thing about the Cradle books is that they are very good about maintaining narrative tension (often to the detriment of storytelling) while Forge of Destiny has a lot of trouble with that, particularly with giving a reason to care about the outcome of fights. I wonder if it's because it's a quest? "Don't see the sausage being made" type of deal. 

      I lost interest near the final 40% when the MC chose >!the most boring of the available paths, to be a good little servant to a control freak and gave up most of her agency,!< but kept skimming to see what happens. Even in broad strokes I found the outcomes boring. The last few arcs, >!particularly the tournament arc!< was a masterwork in spoiling tension and spiking stakes.
      ```

      - u/Abpraestigio:
        ```
        Hm, can't really disagree with you there, except to say that I enjoyed it anyway.

        Minor unspoiled spoiler:





















         the loss of agency might not be that bad, since the the MC is apparently not quite important enough to micro manage.

        Besides, it's a quest by a competent QM. It's unlikely to get too restrictive or there wouldn't be any point in making the whole thing interactive.

      If it means what I think it means, explaining it would be a massive spoiler, but if it means what I think it means I also disagree with that terminology. CORDYCEPS is just straight up rational fiction in the sense that the characters are making intelligent decisions based on their goals and the limited information available to them.

  I'd like to second a recommendation I picked up deep in a thread on here, a few weeks back.

  [Purple Days](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/purple-days-asoiaf-joffrey-timeloop-au.450894/) Is a time-loop fic starring Joffrey Baratheon. It's a really fun breakdown of a character everyone loves to hate, and an interesting high-adventure take on the more typically mundane fantasy world of Westeros. The writing is rough in places- possibly the author is ESL? But it continues to pick up steam and get better as it goes.
  ```

  - u/Golden_Magician:
    ```
    I believe I was the one who originally introduced Purple Days to a previous monthly thread! I can confirm that yeah, the author's Chilean and his writing skills improve by leaps and bounds over the course of the story, to the point where he's actually writing beautifully now compared to his initial rough style. As a non-native English speaker myself I find his evolution as a writer to be truly inspirational.

    As for the Yi-Ti's arc, it might have dragged on a bit but I personally enjoyed it, especially since it's a crucial step in Joffrey's development as a character and protagonist.
    Be sure to leave the story a comment if you enjoy it, to keep Baurus motivated to write more!
    ```

  - u/Makin-:
    ```
    Except the Yi Ti arc, which drags for so so so long and only 10% of it is worth it.
    ```

    - u/DraggonZ:
      ```
      I think it has similar purpose to the "Endless Eight" from The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. It's reeeeeaallly booooring, but it makes your experience closer to the one the protagonist is going through.
      ```

      - u/Makin-:
        ```
        Dunno if that's the best example because Endless Eight wasn't that long and repetitive in the novels, it was only extended in the anime so they could do the different animation gimmick.
        ```

    - u/FormerlySarsaparilla:
      ```
      I am working my way through that arc now, it definitely feels like the author took a hard turn into a different story.

  [Bad Publicity](https://archiveofourown.org/works/6692113) is a DC Fanfic about Bruce Wayne's Twitter. Instead of text the fic is made of authentic looking Twitter mockups.

  For anyone looking for a little more hope and rationality in the real world, I have two non-fiction recommendations by the same author: [The Better Angels of Our Nature](https://stevenpinker.com/publications/better-angels-our-nature) (2011) and[ Enlightenment Now](https://stevenpinker.com/publications/enlightenment-now-case-reason-science-humanism-and-progress) (2018) by Steven Pinker

  *The Better Angels of Our Nature* shows, using historical data, how things have gotten better over the course of human history. How there is less murder, less illness, less war, famine, injury, death and suffering now than there was 2000, 500 or 50 years ago.

  *Enlightenment Now* focuses more on the recent past (really, the Enlightenment through to the present) and more on the *how* behind the progress--the ideologies and social institutions that push progress forward. It also takes a look at the cognitive biases that make it seem like the world is getting worse when it isn't.

  Both of these are fairly heavy, dense reads (with lots of graphs!), so if you're looking for something lighter, I'd recommend any of Pinker's other books, which are mainly about linguistics and psychology. In particular, [The Language Instinct](https://stevenpinker.com/publications/language-instinct), which is a great introduction to the field of linguistics.

  Edit: spelling
  ```

  - u/fassina2:
    ```
    I've read several of steven pinker's books, and I haven't considered any of them to be great. Average, or above average maybe, but that's it.

    &#x200B;

    You can just tell he uses a lot of filler, and by that I mean he could make his point in 4-10 pages but because he wants to sell a book he bloats it to 300+ pages. Several little example stories per chapter that add virtually nothing but word count.

    &#x200B;

    He's a good non fiction writer don't get me wrong, I just don't enjoy filler. He writes the kind of non fiction that people that don't read a lot of non fiction enjoy, there's value in that, you learn one interesting thing and a few examples to talk about at a dinner party. I just feel that it's too little return for a 300+ page book.
    ```

  - u/sicutumbo:
    ```
    Umm, better **Angels**, not Angles.

    Yes, definitely agree with the recommendation. I haven't read Enlightenment Now, but I plan to sometime soon.

    Better Angels is fantastic, and even if it wasn't for me specifically, it could be a life changing book. Very dense, I agree, but well worth it. If I had to recommend one book to change their worldview, Better Angels would be a prime contender.

  I'm looking for long form text fiction. Preferably fantasy, but I'm down for good sci-fi and really good historical or literary fiction as well. I prefer stuff available for free online, but I don't mind paying if I can get an ebook of it as well. The caveat is I read really fast, like I knocked Worm out in under a week fast. So, you might have to dig a little to find something I haven't already read. I've read pretty much all the fantasy and superhero stuff in the top 20 on TWF, with the exception of the Wandering Inn, which I just couldn't get into. I enjoyed the Malazan book of the fallen, dropped the Wheel of Time series around book 6, but might be open to picking it up again if someone strongly recommended the later books. I've had a lot of downtime at work recently and all I've got left in my queue is the last book of the Witcher series and then I'll be down to picking random things off the shelf at Half Priced Books, so, hit me with those obscure recommendations.
  ```

  - u/fassina2:
    ```
    Brandom Sanderson maybe? He's popular, and really good. 

    I love me some Mark Lawrence, he's more dark fantasy / grimdark but he's good, like make you like the most evil protagonist you'll see in a while, good. 

     Patrick Rothfuss is great, been waiting for that 3rd book for a while now.

    You can go to novelupdates and check the top rated stuff in the categories you like, it's mostly eastern origin fiction.

    Goodreads book of the year votes are or were going on, maybe look at the results for the categories you enjoy.

    Checking out the finalists of the Nebula award and world fantasy award of this and past years could also be useful.

  I've recently been hooked on Peter Watts' Sunflower Cycle. He's the dark genius guy who wrote Blindsight and The Things.

  It's not much right now, only 3 short stories and a novella (plus a hidden short story that acts as a teaser for the next part of the story), but it paints a really cool 'verse that embraces Deep Time.

  Basic premise is that instead of finding a network of worm holes built by precursors, lets focus in on the poor bastards who had to go out there and make them. After a while humans stop coming out of the new worm holes, but the mission continues on anyway due to ~~plot HAL friend computer CHIMP~~, the AI in charge of the mission.

  I've always been darkly attracted to stories about being lost in a way that destroys all hope of returning, and nothing does that better than a hard sci-fi story dealing with deep time. Millions of years pass, and outside of your tiny bubble the universe your culture, language, and phenotype aren't even in the historical record any more.

  [This Review](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2309339914?book_show_action=false&from_review_page=1) of the recently published novella has a recommended reading order and warnings on helping decide if it's something you should read.

  ---

  I also listened to [The Forever](https://www.goodreads.com/series/204796). 6 book series published as 3 audiobooks, it's a similar premise to the oft-recommended and acclaimed Bobiverse, but it takes the idea in a very different direction. I won't say it's better or worse than Bobiverse, I can very much see someone liking either more.

  Instead of being a Vonn Neumann probe on an indefinite mission in a 'verse mostly devoid of aliens, The Forever is ironically named in that it focuses on a much shorter period of time, a century long trip to nearby stars to survey them for potential immigration to move whoever manages to get off earth before it's destroyed by a rogue planet screwing up the solar system's orbits.

  It's much softer sci-fi, as the "brain uploading" system and other AI is all handwaved, and later alien tech indistinguishable from magic shows up, but it's still a fun character driven comedy adventure.

  Fiction rec: [Foundryside](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37173847-foundryside) by Robert Jackson Bennett. It has the neatest magic system I've seen in a while; there is this written language that when properly used can convince reality to be subverted.  There is this society that is slowly rediscovering this language and how to use it from the ruins of a dead civilization which apparently self-destructed somehow. Enter Sanchia, a cat burglar who can hear the history of objects she touches. 

  Non-fiction rec: [Superforecasting: The Art and Science of Prediction](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23995360-superforecasting) by Philip E. Tetlock,  Dan Gardner. I listened to a few very good podcasts(80,000 hours, Rationally Speaking) with Tetlock as a guest a while ago and decided to actually read the novel discussed for once. In the book he goes into how most so-called experts are pretty bad at making concrete predictions of the future, and what how actual good forecasters use evidence based, probabilistic, logical analysis to make good predictions. Though, like with pretty much all non-fiction books I've read, I felt like the book would have been just as informative and a better read if they cut like 40% out.

  So I don't know if this counts, but [this NSFW](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/404010/1/friendship-is-replicable/nexus) MLP fan fiction is about the forcible, fundamental reprogramming of civilisation to end war and disagreement by uploading everyone's mind into a sort of telepathic internet so everyone can access everyone else's memories and subsequently loses all sense of individuality.

  >"This is just the beginning, Twilight. In a moment you'll realize precisely how random your beliefs and personality truly are," said Thorax.

  [...]

    Behold, **[Digibro's Guide to Cute Girls Doing Cute Things](https://myswordisunbelievablydull.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/guide-to-cute-girls-going-cute-things.jpg)**.

    The ones I'd personally endorse are:

    - **Girlish Number**- Can be reductively summarized as a more grounded and cynical Shirobako, with a more specific focus on voice actors. I probably like this one more, though.

    - **Hibike Euphonium**- Looks at a high school concert band as they make an attempt to qualify for the national tournament. This is Kyoto Animation at their best, impeccable character animation with unforgettable moments.

    - **Madoka Magica**- Doesn't super fit this genre, but it's still in my Top 3 of all anime, so I have to list it. Simply one of the most perfectly constructed shows I've ever seen.

      I'd like to disendorse these shows.

      Hibike:

      Too little action. Though if one likes K-on and lucky star, they'll probably like this show.

      Madoka:

      I'm kinda surprised this sub likes a show where the main characters make consistently bad/stupid decisions and the biggest plot hole and driving factor behind the conflict is an unexplained absence of adults.

      >Shirobako

          I finished the entire season. They did pacing really, really well but because of the plot hole it was also not very pleasant to watch because the thought that this could all be resolved with a 911 call came up all the time and distracted from what was going on.

            The plot could be resolved with a 911 call? How?

            >!Magical girls *have* to hunt witches, because otherwise grief will accumulate in their soul gems and they will turn into them. It *will* happen in the long-term even if they don't use magic, because of mundane negative emotions. Witches are impervious to interventions of non-magical girls. Even though their bodies could be destroyed by mundane means, as Homura shows, you can't access or see their realms without magic; Walpurgisnacht is an exception, but *she* is potentially immune to nuclear weapons. More importantly, Kyubey the advanced alien is the real enemy; it won't permit the government at large to know. It's likely that it could either edit people's perceptions or erase their memory, and that it has full awareness of everything happening on the planet.!<

            >!So: the government can't easily save magical girls, can't easily defeat witches, and is at the Incubator's mercy.!<

            I don't see any important part of the plot that could be solved with a 911 call, unless you're postulating a hypercompetent government made up of our Saturday Munchkinry Thread residents or something.

            110 presumably but sure I see your point. A lot of anime pretend adults don't exist. Madoka talks to her parents which is more than most

        And I'd like to re-endorse them! I can do this all day. 

        More seriously, I cannot sympathize with the dislike of Madoka Magica, nor those specific criticisms. The presence of adults are... really not an obstacle to the primary movers of that show. On top of being generally excellent, the points of appeal it has for this sub lies in the [](/s "in-universe justification for the entire magical girl system. Answers the who's and the why's of the whole system.") Not gonna have a drag-out debate about how logically coherent this whole show is, but suffice to say I disagree.

    If you enjoyed K-On, try Tamako Market, which I found to be the same thing more concentrated, and also maybe Hibike Euphonium.

    Haibane Renmei is a classic, though arguably slightly different but nevertheless must-watch. Niea_7, same era, same artist is more fluff less misery; or Gunslinger Girl for full-on depression if you prefer that.

    For character studies, a somewhat adjacent genre, try 3-gatsu no Lion and Chihayafuru.

    Tamayura, Ramen Daisuki Koizumi-san, C3-bu, Koufuku Graffiti, Yuru Camp all fall firmly into the “girls doing things” genre but are all pure fluff and no substance, so YMMV depending quite what you are after (I also found K-on to be on the fluff side personally so our preferences may differ here).

    Gakkou Gurashi and Happy Sugar Life are girls doing horror; the former more light-hearted, the other less fantastical but reaching wildbow levels of viewer discomfort.

    One of the really interesting things about *New Game!* in particular is that it's *just* girls/women. Boys/men are pretty much exclusively background characters with no speaking lines or identities, with the exception of one of the character's little brother. It's definitely a deliberate choice on the part of the creators, but it always strikes me as just a little bit odd (though not in a bad way).

    (You listed all the ones I would recommend, so I have nothing to add there.)
