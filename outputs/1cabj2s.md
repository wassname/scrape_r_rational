## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  So I've been having a blast with a bunch of Youjo Senki crosses, notably because our main character is hyper-competent.  
  So here to recommend a few more obscure ones that I enjoyed:

  [A Young woman's game of thrones](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-young-girls-game-of-thrones.1095557/#post-92896145)

  Probably one of my favourites, Tanya in westoros, as a new middle child of Cersi Lanister. Just gold.

  By the same author:  
  [A Young Woman's Inevitable Dance of the Dragons](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-young-womans-inevitable-dance-of-the-dragons.1143397/)

  Shorter and newer, earlier in the timeline but just as fun.

  Then some more well-known:  
  [The count of Serenno](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/count-of-serenno-youjo-senki-x-star-wars.1071101/)

  Tanya as Duku's daughter. Just gold.

  Then most famous but must-reads if have not read:

  [A Young Woman's Political Record](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-young-womans-political-record-youjo-senki-saga-of-tanya-the-evil.660569/) - Continuation of cannon.

  [A Young Girl's Delinquency Record](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-young-girls-delinquency-record-youjo-senki-saga-of-tanya-the-evil.788149/) - Same as above but a little different I think? Can't remember but also brilliant.

  [The Cold War](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-cold-war-2024-rewrite-replaced-35k-words-of-early-chapters.948007/) - Continuation of A Young Woman's Political Record.

  There are a bunch of others, a few I dropped a few I didn't read. Any others you guys recommend?

  I also want to mention, for those who like Boardgames, I currently running a Kickstarter campaign for a game I designed! It is a reprint and expansion of [Cosmos: Empires](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/biggerworldsgames/cosmos-empires-culture-clash-reprint-and-expansion?ref=dt6igl).  
  It has a Print and Play pledge option, as well as a to-be-completed singleplayer mode (2-8 players otherwise).  
  Please check that out as well if it sounds interesting! It's really hard being an Indi developer and any support is incredible, and you guys have been so far :)

  Enjoy!\~

    A few more Tanya fics that I thought were decent-to-good:

    * [A Young Girl's Weaponization of the Mythos](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-young-girls-weaponization-of-the-mythos-youjo-senki-cthulhu-mythos-crack-parody.1062200/) - Instead of her canon career, Tanya proposes to weaponize "ancient magic". Ongoing, getting close to the end.
    * [Shoulder Devil](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/shoulder-devil-youjo-senki-naruto.821249/) - Naruto crossover. Dead.
    * [The Pixie of the Hidden Leaf](https://archiveofourown.org/works/44908171) - Tanya as Team 7's sensei in Narutoverse. Ongoing, slow updates.
    * [A Young Kunoichi’s Battle Record](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-young-kunoichi%E2%80%99s-battle-record-naruto-youjo-senki.960308/) - Tanya once again reborn in Narutoverse. Died early.

    And a couple of Tanya fics which I thought were well written but eventually abandoned for various reasons:

    * [A Young Girl's Guerrilla War](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-young-girls-guerrilla-war-youjo-senki-saga-of-tanya-the-evil-x-code-geass.971950/) - Code Geas crossover. Tanya's character development was handled well, but at some point we started getting really long chapters from other characters’ perspective, which created significant pacing issues.
    * [A Young Woman's Marvelous Adventure](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-young-womans-marvelous-adventure-youjo-senki-mcu.944975/) - Tanya into MCU; may work better for MCU fans.

        In my head, I keep confusing it with [My Hero School Adventure is Wrong, As Expected](https://archiveofourown.org/works/23072158/chapters/55189093), which is an MHA crossover that does not involve Tanya at all, but the main characters feel like they have a lot in common.

  - u/thomas_m_k:
    ```
    *A Young Woman's Inevitable Dance of the Dragons* is very interesting in that it never shows the perspective of Tanya, the main character. We only get PoVs from the people around her.

The quest format makes things more interesting to me, since it adds some uncertainty.

  [Violent Solutions](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/52324/violent-solutions) - The worldbuilding in this story is quite interesting.

  # Recommendations:

  Been on a bit of a Gamer crossover binge, trying to find good ones, so I thought I would recommend the best one I've read (been recommended here before, but not for a while):

  * [The Games We Play - by Ryuugi ](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/rwby-the-gamer-the-games-we-play-disk-five.341621/)
     * A RWBY/Gamer fic, following Juane Arc.  The world building is incredible and deep, and while some people have complained about power creep (fair), my personal opinion, without really going into spoilers, is that the nature of his powers is completely justified, and intrinsically tied to the premise of the story in a very interesting way.

  Some other recs:

  * [The Dire Saga](https://www.goodreads.com/series/179186-the-dire-saga) - by Andrew Seiple
     * Campy, genre aware supervillain shenanigans, with shades of grey MC.  Fantastic romp.
  * [Dire/Worm](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/dire-worm-worm-au-oc.300816/)
     * The origins of the Dire character, before the author turned it into it's own series.  One of my favorite Worm crossovers.
     * Unfortunately incomplete, but there's a good amount of content. He stopped to write actual books.

  # Request:

  * Any really good Gamer fics. I've read a ton, and pretty sure I've read most of the Worm ones (Greg Vader Vs. The World, A Bad Name, etc), but if I've missed a good one or you have a different Gamer crossover you particularly liked, I'm open and eager. (...in a PG sort of way)
  * Any particularly good RR fic that may have flown under the radar.
  * Any good completed fics.  I'm just looking to expand my reading list. Sorry I'm not being more specific.

    My favorite gamer fic is [A Gamer in South Blue](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13260401/1/A-Gamer-In-South-Blue), which is set in One Piece. It largely takes place far away from the canon storyline, so it basically ignores the stations of canon and does its own thing.
    ```

    - u/ViceroyChobani:
      ```
      I binged this over a few days - it was pretty good, definitely enjoyable. A decent amount of the more nonsensical parts of the story were "saved" by saying "that's just the One Piece universe for ya", which...honestly, I don't mind.

      The one thing I'd say is that - while it's *possible* to enjoy it without prior knowledge of One Piece, technically, you definitely can get lost a fair amount without it.  I myself have no explicit knowledge of canon, so I kept the One Piece wiki open in another tab the whole time.

    Ymmv on the Taylor version portrayed in the fic who is >!callous and vicious towards anyone *she* considers a bad person!<. Although >!her character arc has her mellowing, somewhat, as the story progresses!<. I enjoyed the characterization personally, but it seems to polarize people (in both directions).

  [Fallow Fields,](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/fallow-fields-naruto-si.113891/#post-26847542) a Naruto SI. 

  Blurb:

  > For every rising star that the shinobi world produces, a hundred other geniuses are chewed up and spit out. Seiko crawls out of that grinder, only to find that she still has the rest of her life to face head on.

  Following an SI into the OC older sister of Kakashi as she navigates ninja life after a crippling injury, this fic delves into some interesting character dynamics and a look at Konoha from a fairly unique perspective: that of the ninja working desk duty where missions are handed out. The SI manages to have agency despite not ostensibly being a combatant, and makes initially minor but later much more major changes to canon despite her physical struggles. The relationship between her and Kakashi is fun to read about, and the dialogue is great, if a little opaque at times.  

  In the process of grabbing the link to that fic, I realised it's by the same author as another Naruto SI I'd give a rec to: [The Scorpion and the Frog](https://archiveofourown.org/works/34804690/chapters/86665126).

  Blurb:

  > Maybe the fate of Uchiha Itachi and the Uchiha Clan could have been changed if Itachi had just had one more family member he could trust -- someone as powerful, invested in Konoha, and devoted to the clan as him. Someone with a little extra knowledge up her sleeve.
  >
   Unfortunately for Itachi, the Uchiha's abysmal luck with siblings has given him... Kaeru.

  This fic follows the OC sister of Itachi and Sasuke as she makes her way through the ninja life and hates every moment of it, culminating in a twist where she takes the fall for Itachi for the Uchiha massacre and joins Akatsuki in his place. The protagonist is... your mileage may vary for her, but I found her great fun, abrasive in a way I found entertaining. The character interactions and dynamics are clearly this author's strength, and she shows them off to great effect again here. A bonus: this one is complete at 63k words and well worth an evening of reading.

  Next is a Worm/Shadowrun fusion, [Good People](https://archiveofourown.org/works/38469367/chapters/96145216).

  Blurb:

  > Taylor Hebert's no Shadowrunner, just a talented technomancer who spends her days doing petty Matrix jobs. Then a crew of runners in need of a tech expert reaches out to her with an offer too profitable to refuse, and she discovers that for someone with her gifts, there are much better - and riskier - ways to make a profit.

  In which Taylor is a hacker working with the Undersiders... but there's more to it than that, of course, as you'd expect. Though I'm not familiar enough with Shadowrun to say how accurate it is, I can say the worldbuilding on its own is stellar, seemlessly translating the characters, their personalities and Worm-canon powers into the dystopic cyberpunk magic setting. This author writes the Undersiders' dynamic really well, with creative heists and action interspersed with moments of great character development. 

  [Canucks](https://archiveofourown.org/works/38990139/chapters/97525608) is an interesting one.

  Blurb

  >"What are you?" - Ygritte of the Free Folk

  "Canadians."
  >
  "What the bugger's a Canadian?"




  ... not the best summary. A Game of Thrones fanfiction where a small group of OC Canadian soldiers find themselves beyond the wall in mysterious circumstances with a bunch of equipment including a tank thingie(?) and a lot of guns and ammunition, and somehow it doesn't devolve into wanky uplift! They immediately encounter the white walkers and retreat, thereafter forced to ally with the Free Folk to prevent further disaster North of the Wall. The characters are interesting and surprisingly fleshed out, the plot moves at a good pace with interesting developments, and the world reacts to the appearance of some dudes with guns in ways that feel appropriate. There are a couple of stumbles plotwise, but overall I think it's worth a read.

  ... and I'll self shill again. 

  [Late to the Party](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/84049/late-to-the-party), a fantasy isekai story with a little twist I've been writing for Royal Road's writeathon challenge:

  > The desperate people of a world assailed by chaos demons are forced to turn to their last resort: summoning the five prophesied heroes to save them. Unfortunately, even after all their careful preparations, something goes wrong. Only four heroes arrive.

  > One hundred years later, Lucas Brown wakes up in a ruined, decrepit castle with no idea how he got there. With rapidly-growing abilities, magic or otherwise, foisted on him, Lucas is forced to survive in a dying world where everyone knows his name, and many have strong opinions on his long absence.

  > And far in the North, in the Blighted Lands, the Demon Lord awaits.

  Check it out if you feel like it.

  We're nearing the end of the first arc with about 70k words published so far, and most feedback has been generally positive. My intent is to have the protagonist explore the magic system with a rational approach and display his intelligence in doing so, and I'd like to think the worldbuilding will make enough sense to pass muster. I want to build a cast of likeable, intelligent characters who make understandable decisions based on their circumstances and personalities. As I said, we're reaching the end of the first 'arc' and from here a lot more will be revealed about the world and the plot will kick into higher gear.

  This week I read:

  ### *[Systema Delenda Est](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/83315/systema-delenda-est)* by InadvisablyCompelled

  This is the same author who wrote *Paranoid Mage* and *Blue Core* which are both rather popular on RR, yet I had mixed-to-negative feelings about (Paranoid mage had a decent start, then got lost; Blue Core is too porny and just eugh). 

  Despite this, I decided to give this a shot, because the premise looked interesting (anti-System apocalypse), and after reading what's available, I'd rate it as "good/decent Royalroad fare" and I'll probably follow it and read the next couple chapters as they come out. 

  Basically, the premise is that Earth got "system apocalypsed" sometime in the future, but surprise, the fundamentals of the System (basically the Xianxia genre as a whole) are complete dogshit and all revolve around power, killing, exploitation, etc. The mostly post-biological human civilization didn't really jive well with the System's brand of mind control (euphoric level ups from killing things) along with all the other Xianxia bullshit like "young masters" portaling into the "new frontier" (Earth) and "dungeons" forming. In response, the humans and their AIs got their shit together and did a little technology vs physics-altering System-magic slugfest. The humans won, and were able to push the System out of Earth/Sol space. 

  After this victory, a traumatized survivor and combatant in this war (Cato) decides that this isn't enough, and launches a one-gestalt crusade against the System. Armed with all the tools of future humanity technology (think factorio, von-neumann, etc) he slips into a rapidly closing portal to a System-ruled world with the mission of liberating the world from the System using, among other methods, orbital railguns and god-killer antimatter shells. 

  It's fun because the two genres (posthumanity scifi and xianxia-system-cultivation etc) clash together well and in interesting ways. Cato is, as a postbiological gestalt, essentially immortal and playing what could almost be considered creative mode Factorio in space where he develops orbital and lunar infrastructure, and meanwhile high-powered "classers/cultivators" are mucking around on the planet and such. It's a very interesting fusion, and I'm interested to see where the author takes this. 

  **Recommendations?**

  Anyone got some more recommendations in this genre (fighting back against system-apocalypses or the fundamentals of the xianxia setting)?
  ```

  - u/GlueBoy:
    ```
    Shadow Slave might match your criteria. There's a pervasive ambiguity over whether the system, referred to in world as the Nightmare Spell, is the savior of the world or its doom. 

    I really like the story, but I recognize that it's kind of a mixed bag. The worldbuilding and plot can be fantastic, it has that mystery box aspect present in all the best rat!fics like hpmor and WtC. The prose is clunky and the pacing is often abysmal.

  Omicron, the author of the excellent [Now You Feel Like Number None](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/now-you-feel-like-number-none-bleach-arrancar-quest.37531/reader) recently started another story [Asphodel in Mourning](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/asphodel-in-mourning-a-disco-elysium-inspired-pok%C3%A9mon-quest.129103/reader/).

  Firstly, go read Number None if you haven't already, you won't regret it! Secondly, although it's still very early on, I quite enjoy what's there of Asphodel. The Disco Elysium style really lends itself well to the anthropomorphism of the types, and the main character's viewpoint is an interesting non-standard one, which I tend to enjoy.

    I opened both links, and was immediately pleasantly surprised by the writing style. Something this readable is rare to come by. With that said, how much do I need to know from either Bleach or Pokemon (or Hollow Knight; well, at least I'm familiar with Disco Elysium!)? I read the first arc of Bleach (saving Rukia) about ten years ago, and I know general stuff about Pokemon through cultural osmosis.
    ```

    - u/Zeitfor:
      ```
      For Number None, not much of bleach. It's largely content to explore its own side of things. For Asphodel, I know almost nothing about Disco Elysium and it reads perfectly fine to me. Seems much more Pokemon based and merely using the Disco style as an alternative storytelling device.

  If you are interested in biology, or just appreciate detailed speculations on fantasy elements, this is the fic for you. 


  Characters
  The main character's main trait is a passion for biology and teaching it. It comes through as really genuine and is highly contagious(to the reader and the other characters). The cast is full of fun characters, enough so that even if the worldbuilding goes over your head the character's shenanigans might carry you through. 


  Worldbuilding
  The magical biology worldbuilding is amazing. The story explains how turgor pressure applies to slimes, teases dragons through an eel with vestigial glands that produce flammable oil and so on. 


  Overall, a fic I absolutely adore for its fun characters and fascinating worldbuilding(+links to interesting further reads). Only downside is that the story hasn't had a chance to go far yet( though the plot isn't the main draw) and is on indefinite hiatus.

  It's been recommended a couple of times on this sub in the past, it's relatively well-known in webfiction circles, but if you're looking for a web serial with excellent horror worldbuilding based on the magical girl genre, I recommend [*Nowhere Stars*](https://nowherestars.net/) by Anemone. If you're expecting something along the lines of [*Worm*](https://parahumans.wordpress.com/) by Wildbow then you won't be too disappointed since both blend cosmic and psychoanalytic horror into a nobledark world with a lonely, pessimistic teenage girl protagonist with a grotesque, tragic ability who gradually build up their power.

    Nowhere Stars has great potential, but it's 50% angst by weight which really slows down the plot. Worldbuilding is also very interesting, but it is under explored due to aforementioned focus on angst. Author needs to either move the plot, or increase his release schedule.

      That's fair, I like a lot of angst but I understand that others might feel it's superfluous.

  Eliezer Yudkowsky (of HPMOR fame) [has opened a prediction market for getting fiction recommendations](https://manifold.markets/EliezerYudkowsky/what-book-will-i-enjoy-reading?r=RWxpZXplcll1ZGtvd3NreQ). I'm pretty sure he has read the four highest trading ones though. (At the time of writing, that's Unsong, Antimemetics division, Practical Guide to Evil, Cordyceps.)

  He also lists fiction he enjoyed. I knew most of it, but not all, so I have some new things to try now!

  Non-fiction, but a strong recommendation: [HealthyGamerGG](https://www.youtube.com/@HealthyGamerGG) on youtube. I've seen other therapist youtube channels, but what seems to set this one apart is how tailored it is for systematic thinkers. The target audience is gamers, but the consequence of making therapy that works for gamers is making therapy that works for people who are highly analytical/systematizing.

  Caveat: In addition to being a trained therapist, Dr. K. is a Buddhist monk, and some of the ideas he brings from there come across a bit deathist. He doesn't come across as particularly dogmatic about it, just thought I'd mention it. (Potentially a good resource for steelmanning that POV.)

    I don't like his Eastern vs Western medicine rhetoric. I would have expected someone like him to not fall prey to the 'It has existed for thousands of years so it must be right' fallacy.

      throwback to the time when someone called in because they were having problems with anger, and his number one advice to that dude was unironically to eat more yoghurt, because gut biomes and [some indian terms I've forgotten about, something something spiritual balance]. No I'm not making this up.

      Guy alternates between extremely sharp and useful insight on the human condition, and falling into a bottomless pit of esoteric woo.

      You might enjoy his discussion with Dr Mike, where Dr Mike kinda goes on the offensive against the Eastern Medicine stuff, and it allows you to get a deeper look at what Dr K thinks. 

      (Dr Mike is another youtube doctor that is very successful)

    Hmm. I'm a Theravāda Buddhist, though obviously not a monk (I haven't even been to a silent retreat yet, though I plan to). My general vibe from various suttas, meditations, and just speaking to people was "yeah, nirvana is cool, but you definitely ain't getting it this time around, so just focus on living the best/least-dukkha life." If you were to die, most/all of your progress to enlightenment would get reset, which is obviously unproductive.
