  Basic security?  Clearly secrecy.  The dark wizards can't act against you if they* don't know you're after them.  This means that you probably have to be a bit shady yourself, using wizardry to hide evidence of your existence and generating plausible reasons for the disappearance of the resources you require.

  You will probably have to live in a semirural area if you have to do a lot of coming and going, but at the same time, you might need the ability to have heavy things delivered.  Living underneath a wholesaler's regional distribution center might work.  They tend to be in or around the edges of suburbia so their trucks can move in and out reasonably easily.  They don't have huge numbers of employees.  They receive shipments all the time.

  You will have to implement security measures that effect even yourself.  Even when you enter the secret facility under the warehouse, you are rendered unconscious and imprisoned by your own defenses.  When you wake, you have to know how to free yourself.  This keeps dark wizards from impersonating you and gaining access to your facility when you are out, even if they can perfectly imitate your body.

  * [I corrected this from you, which would make sense logic-wise to a degree, but also makes the whole thing pretty pointless.  If even you don't know you're after dark wizards, then you're pretty safe from being discovered as a dark wizard hunter!]

    Not paranoid enough! You should have others verify it first to check for traps, and then immediately disregard their opinions/advice, they could be dark wizards.
