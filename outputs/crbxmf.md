  I believe it would probably be more economical to run personalities that didn't self-destruct through successive educational cycles, as they would presumably get better at their craft the more practice they got, & also would have a proven track record of not self-destructing.

  When they finally did, you'd then just use the last iteration, the one that self-destructed, as your labor-force until some other personality reached a higher number of cycles or was performing better by whatever metrics were used to measure value.

  I'd also try to keep as many persons around as cost-effective long-term storage allowed for, because they'd each have different strengths, & the quantum randomness of the universe would mean that just because a given personality iteration would suicide most of the times it was run, eventually one would come where it didn't & would move to a higher iteration quantifier.

    exactly this. Fascinating, high-quality, and bone-chillingly terrifying/depressing.

  [According to the author](https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/05/28/book-review-age-of-em/#comment-365155), he based his story on [Robin Hanson's ideas about em economics](http://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/uploads.html).

  Also reminds me of [Vernor Vinge's The Cookie Monster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cookie_Monster_\(novella\))
