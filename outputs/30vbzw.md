## r!Animorphs/The Reckoning theorizing

### Post:

**tl;dr The universe of r!Animorphs/The Reckoning is the product of desperate Time Matrix shenanigans intended as a last ditch attempt to destroy The One.**

Wild Mass Guessing for *The Reckoning*, by /u/TK17Studios. https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11090259/1/r-Animorphs-The-Reckoning

What's going on? How did this happen? 

This isn't just an AU. 

The key is the Time Matrix. In the series it has gone unquestioned that the Time Matrix sends you back in time, but *The Andalite Chronicles* suggests that this isn't true. While the Time Matrix is used to (apparently) travel back in time, the first time it was used a botched universe was created. 

Riddle me this: What's more likely, that the Time Matrix sends you back in time and creates new universes, or that the Time Matrix only creates new universes, and your apparent time travel is the result of the universe being recreated as it was at your intended temporal destination? 

It isn't just that a new universe is created, however. Given that Cassie was able to figure out that something was wrong with her world, I would argue that the new universe replaces the old one. Cassie's... let's call it her "pattern" for the moment, Cassie's pattern is such that it is able to tell when the universe has changed in a way that relates to Time Matrix usage rather than the normal processes of time. 

But wait. We're not done yet. 

The Time Matrix was *used*. Maybe it was Jake or one of the other Animorphs or someone we've never even heard of, but the Time Matrix was used, and it was used with the intention of creating a new universe where everyone was smarter... even the Yeerks. 

Why? It would be easy to see why you'd want to make the Andalites, or the Animorphs, or some other Friendly more intelligent, but why the Yeerks as well? 

We may never know for sure, but it is possible that the reason may be The One, which we got only a glimpse of at the end of the series. Suppose that the conflict with The One went south. Disastrously south. And suppose that you had the Time Matrix, but you couldn't use it to just get rid of The One with a few button presses. 

Why would this be? There is evidence to suggest that there is a limit to what the Time Matrix affects. Perhaps it does not extend into Z-space, or to where the Ellimist and Crayak live, or the Time Matrix itself is unchanged from universe to universe. What if The One existed, even in a slight degree, in this same domain of Things That Cannot Be Reached By The Time Matrix? 

If that's the case, you could do everything to fight it except use the Time Matrix against it directly. So our unknown meddler in time and space created a new universe with smarter people in it and, what's more, it apparently thought that dominion under the Yeerks was preferable to whatever The One was going to do. Or alternately, that the repeated defeat of the Yeerk Empire was preferable. 

See, if all sides involved have gotten a boost, then it is clear that our meddler was not playing favorites. Either our meddler was so far removed that this was an inconsequential conflict, or our meddler was so desperate to ensure that The One was defeated that it was willing to let its own side lose in order to make sure that whoever won was as smart and battle-honed as possible. 

Alterations to how morphing technology, &c work may be side effects of physical or Z-space changes made as additional indirect strikes against The One. And/or they will in some way be useful in themselves. 

One last note: Word of God is that the Time Matrix (probably) does not exist (citations at the end). This means that there are no more chances here. Either The One will be defeated, or rocks fall, everyone dies. There are two possible reasons for this. The first is that The One almost reached the Time Matrix the first time around and our meddler doesn't want to take the chance of this happening in the new universe. The other possible reason: The One is somehow related to the Time Matrix, and while it cannot be destroyed with the Time Matrix it also cannot be destroyed by anything else so long as the Time Matrix still exists. 

I think it most likely that the Time Matrix is somehow incapable of affecting itself (except, perhaps, by simply unmaking itself altogether, though it is possible that something else was used to destroy the Time Matrix after it was used) and that some piece of The One exists within the Time Matrix. I haven't the foggiest idea how yet. 

**Citations:**

> In all four of the rules above, stick to the spirit of canon rather than the letter. Dropping the Time Matrix makes readers cry "foul" if what they care about is the HISTORY of the Animorphs universe, but if what they care about is the characters, the feel, and the spirit, I think most honestly won't mind.

(that said: if it turns out that the Time Matrix does in fact exist, most of the theory still remains intact)

**Edit:** I said that I haven't the foggiest idea how the One and the Time Matrix would be connected but given the Ellimist's track record... I guess I wouldn't be too surprised if I found out that The One was an unintended consequence of creating the Time Matrix.

    (I'm glad you like this theory)

    (Weird implication of this theory: There was a time when the only sapient beings in existence were Elfangor, Loren, and Esplin/Visser 3, and also any beings like The One may be, that are protected against the Time Matrix)

    (Okay, and now I'm wondering if it'd be really neat or not for The One to have been created by that aforementioned use of the Time Matrix)

  Now, I haven't read more than a little of the Animorphs because it was so horribly unrational... so there may be something in the books that makes this comment moot... but if not I think this question is the result of a category error:

  "Riddle me this: What's more likely, that the Time Matrix sends you back in time and creates new universes, or that the Time Matrix only creates new universes, and your apparent time travel is the result of the universe being recreated as it was at your intended temporal destination?"

  I don't see that there's a meaningful way to distinguish these two statements. What would the observable difference between the two situations be?

    > What would the observable difference between the two situations be?

    If you have universe traveling capabilities outside of the Time Matrix you could travel to the original universe if it still existed.

    If someone tried using the Time Matrix to return to the original universe, it would either need to have the original saved, or generate a fake imitation of the original universe, or it needs to have created a new universe and left the original intact for that person to be able to go their.
