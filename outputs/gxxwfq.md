  A random thought I had at the beginning of the chapter: "It's amazing how easy it is to remain a relevant main character, even as a kid, when you have a nuclear warhead that you can use at any moment against any target".

  > “Sometimes you just gotta make the wrong move, you know?” I said.
  >
  > “Who are you, and what have you done with Jake?”

  I burst out laughing at that line.

  Overall the chapter was really good. V3 needs an editing pass, though. He sounds *way* more like TK17Studios than like reckoning!V3, let alone canon!V3.

    >V3 needs an editing pass, though. He sounds way more like TK17Studios than like reckoning!V3, let alone canon!V3.

    I noticed that, but there’s a *strong* possibility that this is him filtering his language patterns to appeal to Jake’s TK17-flavored sensibilities.
    ```

    - u/CouteauBleu:
      ```
      Even if he is, I'd argue this is a case where the "art style" should be more important than "realism". Like, even if it could make sense that V3 would alter his speech patterns to sound less like V3 to appeal to Jake, from a story perspective he should sound *more* like V3 because having characters with strong distinct personalities is an important part of a story.
      ```

      - u/TK17Studios:
        ```
        FTR, I've *really really* enjoyed the back-and-forth about this, including DuskyDay's comment below, but also I'm very open to people noting specific lines that jerked them around or whatever.  Like, it's not clear to me that I'll be able to find them, myself, just by scanning for "lines that sound too much like your own voice."
        ```

        - u/royishere:
          ```
          The last line of the chapter jarred me a bit.

          But overall, absolutely wonderful. I felt just so... TENSE reading it. And it was just two people talking!
          ```

        - u/Meykem:
          ```
          As the person who complained last time about the Visser using the fuck-word, I didn't have an issue with him in this chapter. Maybe that's because he's speaking to someone else instead of as an internal monologue, or maybe because Jake notes his own anger at the Visser making a sarcastic joke. Or maybe because the fact this conversation is happening at all indicates he's open to getting some value out of conversations with other sapient beings, and therefore might not want to be the universe's sole intelligence. (I recall he's not morphing anymore and would have lost his Jake/Marco/Tobias/David morphs when Alloran died, leaving him with fewer options to entertain himself.)
          ```

    ```
    > It's amazing how easy it is to remain a relevant main character, even as a kid, when you have a nuclear warhead that you can use at any moment against any target

    Minus the kid part, that reminds me of a line from *Snow Crash* by Neal Stephenson.
    ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    I *expected* V3 to sound more trustworthy/familiar/informal and less like V3 to manipulate Jake, and if he sounded like his V3 self, I'd be wondering what was his gamble with *not* changing his language patterns.

    Edit: But I see your point about the literary side... maybe if Jake's inner monologue remarked, at the beginning, that V3's language sounded suspiciously casual? (If that's the sort of thought that Jake would have.)
    ```

  - u/KnickersInAKnit:
    ```
    I viewed it as 'this resurrected V3 has really drifted from the original' with the difference in how he sounded.
    ```

- u/Quibbloboy:
  ```
  Oh, excellent!

  I had a bit of an “I can see my house from here” moment when the Visser mentioned the thing about certain people being in contact with the manufacturers that made the repulsorlifts. It feels possible that I influenced that line with my comment on the *last* chapter, wondering where the repulsorlifts came from. :D

  Anyway, wow, who would have thought military negotiations could be so exciting? I suppose it helps that there’s universe-level stakes and characters we love, and like, aliens.

  Bit of a cold sweat when it came out that THEIR Iscafil device happens to be The Chosen Iscafil Device. Kinda makes you wonder if all the lame ones are called *Escafil* Devices, eh?

  Jake’s poor little black box is right. There are soooo many layers here. Who even knows what’s real? Who could possibly keep track of it all?

  Also, Jesus, Magellan. Jake *knows* you don’t get in the car with the kidnapper, and he *knows* you know that, and just - just let him, okay? He’s probably better at this than you. He has the measure of the situation and the risk. This is THE way to dance with the top of the food chain, and didn’t y’all fly into space looking to negotiate with the Visser anyway? Huff. 

  Shameless plug, assuming this isn’t against sub rules or whatever: I started [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/gwquie/rtwipff_ranimorphs_list_of_unanswered_questions/) talking about as-yet-unresolved mysteries the other day, and it’s only slowly gathering steam. Drop by! Contribute! :)

  Edit: With this chapter, it looks like the fic has just hit 500k words. Woohoo, or wow, or something!

    It's been acknowledged that humans in Andalite morph have advanced processing capabilities as compared to humans in either their base form or their morph armor. I have actually kind of wondered up to this point why the Animorphs don't do all of their major decisionmaking in Elfangor morph, but the kids don't seem that interested in that line of thinking. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

      ```
      Andalite minds are limited in some very important ways. This has been discovered within the past few chapters, and I’d be cool with hand waving it away as Jake’s black box letting him know it is not a good idea.
      ```

- u/None:
  ```
  But... Jake never even tried to answer the question! How do you change your values! He got distracted negotiating...
  ```

  - u/Frommerman:
    ```
    That's what they're doing. Their values are currently in conflict, and both have the ability to destroy far more of what the other values than they're willing to just give up. So they're seeing how they can change what each side values enough so that they are no longer mutually incompatible. That's how you change values: by negotiating with someone who has different ones.

  A small nitpick:

  > geosynchronous orbit over the southern pole

  This doesn't make sense physically. Geosynchronous orbit can only be over the equator.
  ```

  - u/JJReeve:
    ```
    A nitpick to your nitpick:

    Geosynchronous orbits are those which orbit the planet in the same amount of time that it takes the planet to make one full rotation. They can be at any inclination.

    Geostationary orbits are the specific subset of geosynchronous orbits that are over the equator.
    ```

    - u/redstonerodent:
      ```
      I didn't know that; thanks for clarifying!

      Still a geosynchronous orbit wouldn't be over the south pole for long, but the rendevous could have occured above it.
      ```

- u/WalterTFD:
  ```
  Am I understanding correctly that on the Marco's escape pod where the communication setup what happened was roughly:

  1. Visser's marble penetrated the box.
  2. It dissolved.
  3. A Yeerk vessel of the Visser's will grew in Marco's brain (presumably due to a plague or Z-space effect generated by the marble?

  Because, like, they don't seem to be alarmed enough about this fact.  Like, that's the ballgame, right?  Dude has a plague he can use to seed his custom Yeerk equivalents in the course of minutes?
  ```

  - u/TK17Studios:
    ```
    It would be the ballgame if V3 had the ability to produce as many of them as he wanted, and if every species had the ability to produce its own Kandrona, and if the Yeerks are actually V3s and not some other thing like a mere remote control interface.  It's scary but not *necessarily* game over.
    ```

- u/cae_jones:
  ```
  Have I missed something, or do we have no idea how Leerans work? Because their abilities seem like the sort of thing you'd need to be a baby Ellimist to pull off.

  I've also found it curious this entire time that Leerans are basically treated as machines, more than life. How similar/different are they to the Leerans from the books?

  I do like how Leerans are taken a bit more seriously, here. I only remember them appearing in canon twice, in spite of there seemingly being a lot of background buildup toward their relevance. One showed up to save Vissor 1 at the end of 15, and 18 was all about a Z-space "accident" sending the Animorphs to Leera to resolve the dangling plot-thread. And I don't remember them ever being mentioned again, as though this was supposed to be the primary story arc for the teens and that was all.

  18 is one of the few Animorphs books I own in Braille. It's also the one I haven't even opened, because in spite of being a major event that resolved a plotline we were being reminded of for a while... it felt out of place and fillerish. ... Huh, this probably applies to a certain important event in one of my original series, too, come to think of it. Hmm.

  Longtime reader and huge fan of your work.  One of the best fics - period.  KA Applegate should be begging to partner with you and make this a new canon.  


  Very interesting chapter.  I admit, the Visser convinced me already.  Why not move towards a slow disarmament?  
  I'm willing to believe he's even mostly telling the truth - wanting to survive, primarily, and really only wanting/needing the cube.  Though I suspect he's much less willing to let non-Visser life persist than he lets on in that conversation.  Still, that would be evident from a Leeran, so why bother lying.  All he has to really lie about is about not knowing what would really happen if he is able to use the iscafil device - and he could hide that by making the trade in a body never exposed to his research findings.

  Way I see it, there are two paths moving forward towards the obvious end-game of unlocking the Eye of the Universe (to use Outer Wilds terms) where the gods reside.  Either the Animorphs make the trade - buying human independence and safety (assuming they can work through the no-doubt-eventful disarmament and negotiation), but trusting V3 with essentially the key to the universe.  They protect themselves and their people, at the expense of potentially Everyone, while trusting an entity that will definitely double-cross them any chance he gets, because they see no other choice.

  OR - they do the reverse.  If the Visser is to be trusted in his goals (big if) of living forever and stopping entropy, then he is kinda-sadly-strangely someone who could be empathized with.  They can't trust him, after what he's done, but perhaps they could ask him to trust them?  He has their morphs, he can see into their minds, and he could (potentially) believe some human is capable of holding the key to the universe and fulfilling its promise to follow their common goal - e.g. by solving entropy.  They ask the Visser to give an Animorph the instructions they need to unlock the eye of the universe. 

  Of course, the Visser would never make that trade without considerable consolations - he probably wouldn't make it *at all.*  I imagine taking that path and having the Visser let them lead the mission would mean basically trading him every shred of leverage they have - complete and utter surrender of the entire planet, any z-space nukes, every other Animorph, and probably even put a Visser-yerk in reduced-capacity in the co-pilot seat as they open the door.  Everything short of the fact that the Visser needs to trust (in the end) that the key holder will use that power as promised.  Just the way he operates.  (And might would probably be trying like mad to control even that shred of agency).  Still, ultimately it's a path of trust between the Animorphs and the Visser, betting everything on the Cube. 

  I see those two paths as the Crayak and the Ellimist split - one is the result of fear, one is (very reluctant, but still ultimately total) trust and understanding of one-another.  It's possible because - strange as it sounds - the Visser really *should* be able to trust at least someone.  The humans and their goals are pretty simple, and they are naturally inclined to empathy.  But also - he won't necessarily see that, and only point out the desire for vengeance.  Makes it a very interesting negotiation.  IF the Visser actually cared about what he claims (big if) then they could conceivably work together - and he could conceivably trust the humans to lead the mission of unlocking the universe.

  So many game pieces could be played with here though.  Even if the Visser somehow saw the logic of this trust and worked together, what's to stop Marco (or Rachel?) from sabotaging it all out of vengeance - fueled by Crayak?  Looking forward to quite the complex swirl of trust as we reach end-game.

  This is all to say, of course, I probably need to re-read the previous Visser chapters and realize just how fundamentally untrustworthy he is.  Though honestly I've been remembering him as just a Pure Heartless Rational entity, so I'm willing to believe he's capable of seeing the path to total cooperation here.  Just a question of whether the Animorphs will see it and be willing to take it too.
  ```

  - u/JJReeve:
    ```
    My own inclination here would be to get the Visser to agree to tell Helium how to hack the god computer. Of course doing this in a way that prevents him from defecting and tricking Helium into installing a backdoor for the Visser to seize control would be tricky. Or even just having one of his clones attack at the last moment and stealing the key to victory. 

    Maybe if they had the same setup as their current negotiation but added a couple of Leerans at both ends it could work? Visser knows how to hack the computer a little bit and the Leeran copies his brain state to the Visser 1 fragment on his end. This information is shared between the fragments and the Leeran clone on Helium's end (at an undisclosed location to avoid ambush) copies the state into him. Then Helium works on the problem in manageable byte sized chunks and everyone in the system chews over the data to decide how to proceed. Except maybe the link between the Visser 1 fragments isn't high bandwidth enough to support the scheme. Maybe the two ends if the link can't be hidden from eachother. Maybe the Leeran on Heliums end is trapped. 

    The other option involves the Good Ship that Tobias found acting as a safe spot for a non hostile meeting. (I don't think any of the other animorphs know about that yet though?) It should have enough power to prevent violence/defection on the part of all parties. The setup then might be Visser locked in a room, Leeran locked in seperate room, and then Helium locked in a third room working on the hack. Except the ship is almost certainly more than powerful enough, but it might not be intelligent enough. The way it was described, knowing how to react to things by comparing the situation to other situations in its memory and selecting an appropriate response, it's like a super advanced neural net. It can probably stop Visser 3 from any form of trickery that it has seen before, which just leaves all the novel forms that the Visser's considerable intelligence can come up with for this super important event. 

    Trust is quite hard enough as it is, and V3's actions up until now are not exactly making it easier. 

    There's also the possibility that they successfully hack the God computer and then Elimist and Cryak both look at this branch if the They-Were-A-Simulation-This-Whole-Time and agree to not let it occur in reality and then end the simulation because it no longer has bearing on the game being played in the real world. 

    One last thought, going back to the Good Ship chapter I noticed I thing I hadn't before. "There was distress, then, or at least its shadow, for the ship also remembered what had happened next, last time—" I guess this is the time The One Who Is Remembered somehow subverted the anti violence program and made two Howler ships collide. I'm not sure how important this ends up being though.

      We know the Chee count as minds for hypersight purposes; and I bet Good Ship does too, since the interlude made a point of telling us designed it to subjectively experience happiness.

  Amazing chapter, I really liked visser 3. He's such a good villain: intelligent, not evil for the sake of evil, willing to negotiate, and shockingly clear sighted. I wish mainstream media had more villains like that. Jake and Marco too were awesome this chapter. I'm get more impressed by their characterization every chapter, especially with the way they argue and craft very elucidating arguments. Am a huge fan of your work, so please continue to make more.

  I feel like the Visser talking about lying to someone with complete access to his brain state could be a bit of a nod to the audience. Puts me on edge.

  This chapter was great, and I ended up reading it when I needed to calm down from something, so it was great to have something that was relatively straightforward and short and information heavy to comfort me. 

  I loved hearing V3's philosophy, though this "don't want to die" stuff is coming on a little... thick. At first I thought it was bad writing but now I am more inclined to believe that V3 was manipulating Jake somehow. 

  I do like this attitude towards negotiation. I like when villains tell heroes their plans, and I especially like knowing that these are not necessarily the REAL plan

  Nice try, V3. But if you really wanted to build a Dyson Sphere around every star, you know that you'd need German Engineering. And.... you killed all the Germans :(

  Anyway, his presented "wants" seem rather doubtful. Especially his claim that by the time humans and Andalites build Dyson spheres it "would be too late". Unless "too late" really means 
  a couple trillion years in life expectancy less.
  [The average star has a lifespan in the billions, Andalites and humans would get around to harvesting them much sooner!]
  But since he expects trillion trillions anyway, then his other stated values of adventure, companionship, creation, experience and sunshine, green grass and blue skies basically matter less than a trillionth of a percent. (considering that his rampaging puts large costs on all those things)

  Anyway, Jake should pretend to go along with this ridicolousness and negotiate for V3 sharing future sun-harvesting tech once developed and he should probably ask for the Milky Way or at least a spiral arm under Leeran. V3 can have the rest of the lightcone.
  [though really, aren't black holes the energy source for the endgame, anyway?]

  Also I hope Magellan's next move is to create a couple more Jakes so he can use that lying trick himself. Plus a bunch more Marco, Rachel, Tobias and Garret spares. Give them all the Quat-morph, acquire a Naharan and start working on some quantum virusses!
