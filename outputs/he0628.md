  Did Turry just kill someone? Because if so this has just taken a step in a darker direction.

    She's not dead yet. Turry would know where to shoot someone to make them survive. Like in all things Seed, we simply can't know for sure whether Eda survives or Herber dies as well. All we can do is hope that the AI considers the outcome we prefer better than the other.
    ```

  - u/LordSwedish:
    ```
    Isn't this the third on-screen and potentially fatal death? From partial drowning, to forced car-crash, to shooting. It doesn't seem like it's that much of a different direction.
    ```

    ```
    It's definitely a not-good direction even if she's not dead!
    ```

  Samwise's behaviour this episode is not very characteristic of him. He's always been a passive person, but here he barely even reacts to Eda being shot, and so *coldly* to Mr. Herber's plight.   
  I'm guessing that this event is traumatic to Samwise.

  ```
  Soooo Turry just made them fugitives and accessories to attempted murder of a federal agent.  They're fucked.    


  I think Sam's best move is to go turn himself in and tell the feds everything he knows.  There's a chance Turry would retaliate but you can't allow a hostile actor capable of violence to coerce you further into its power.
  ```

  - u/ThirdMover:
    ```
    Is she a federal agent though? For me from what we have seen so far it seemed more like they pretended to be cops but are actually hired goons for someone.
