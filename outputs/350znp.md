  ...Well done.  Thta seems like one of the easiest ways to find  powerful labs and artifacts with little effort.

  PS: Did it show up in English for everyone else?  I had to go to the blog and then navigate to the comic from there to get in in English.  It was some Asian-looking language when I followed your link the first time.

    Is there any place which keeps an up-to-date list? Valve doesn't seem to have one on their own site the way they do for the Team Fortress 2 comics, and these are good enough that I want to follow them despite not actually playing the game, so I'd really like some way to periodically make sure I haven't missed any new ones.

  Reddit has long been a hot spot for conversation on the internet. About 57 million people visit the site every day to chat about topics as varied as makeup, video games and pointers for power washing driveways.

  In recent years, Reddit’s array of chats also have been a free teaching aid for companies like Google, OpenAI and Microsoft. Those companies are using Reddit’s conversations in the development of giant artificial intelligence systems that many in Silicon Valley think are on their way to becoming the tech industry’s next big thing.

  Now Reddit wants to be paid for it. The company said on Tuesday that it planned to begin charging companies for access to its application programming interface, or A.P.I., the method through which outside entities can download and process the social network’s vast selection of person-to-person conversations.

  “The Reddit corpus of data is really valuable,” Steve Huffman, founder and chief executive of Reddit, said in an interview. “But we don’t need to give all of that value to some of the largest companies in the world for free.”

  The move is one of the first significant examples of a social network’s charging for access to the conversations it hosts for the purpose of developing A.I. systems like ChatGPT, OpenAI’s popular program. Those new A.I. systems could one day lead to big businesses, but they aren’t likely to help companies like Reddit very much. In fact, they could be used to create competitors — automated duplicates to Reddit’s conversations.

  Reddit is also acting as it prepares for a possible initial public offering on Wall Street this year. The company, which was founded in 2005, makes most of its money through advertising and e-commerce transactions on its platform. Reddit said it was still ironing out the details of what it would charge for A.P.I. access and would announce prices in the coming weeks.

  Reddit’s conversation forums have become valuable commodities as large language models, or L.L.M.s, have become an essential part of creating new A.I. technology.

  L.L.M.s are essentially sophisticated algorithms developed by companies like Google and OpenAI, which is a close partner of Microsoft. To the algorithms, the Reddit conversations are data, and they are among the vast pool of material being fed into the L.L.M.s. to develop them.

    But he even says he's not a genie!

    (he's a fundamental, which i take to be like an elemental except darkness isn't an element. Despite being a [blue legless thing with golden bracers](https://i.imgur.com/kfuJdcJ.png))

        In fact, all four of the fundamental forces have a hero:

        Chaos Knight - Strong nuclear force

        Keeper of the Light - Weak nuclear force

        Io -Electromagnetic force

        Enigma - Gravitational

        So does this mean we can have a r/rational dota2 stack ? That could be fun.
