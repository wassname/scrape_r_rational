## Pyrebound (unusual high fantasy serial)

### Post:

I am uncertain to what extent my work qualifies as ratfic or ratfic-adjacent.  I can say that I'm the sort of author who obsesses over worldbuilding consistency, and has to stop himself from adding loads of extraneous info about (for example) the way magic affects the economy of a mining town.  But I'm told that this community enjoys all sorts of unusual and thoughtful fic, so I'm giving it a whirl.  Apologies if you've already seen this via the Slate Star Codex Classified thread, etc.

[pyrebound.wordpress.com](https://pyrebound.wordpress.com) is the name of the game.  The world's culture is quasi-Mesopotamian, with a hefty dose of magic and monsters.  It's been up for five months or so, and is presently twenty-five installments long.  The blurb:  "The  world has not been kind to Ram’s family. Father just lost an arm.  Mother can’t work. And if Ram can’t find a way to make money fast, a  life of forced labor is the best any of them can hope for. His only way  forward is through the darkest side of their dark world–fighting on the  front lines of war against the demons, hiding with thieves and assassins  in the shadows, wandering the wilds where the monsters rule.  How much more will the god of the pyre ask him to sacrifice?  And why, Ram wonders, should he be the one to pay?"

Thanks for taking the time to read this!

  I guess it would have been sensible to specify how/to what extent it could be considered ratfic, huh?  The whole human civilization in this story is organized around the use of magic to survive a catastrophic event that recurs every four days; all the society's institutions and culture are rooted in the ways they've had to adapt to this central problem.  I have tried to work through the implications pretty exhaustively; however, they do not take center stage in the novel because it would feel mildly ridiculous to have Ram stop and think at length about aspects of life that are as basic to him as democracy or corporations are to us.  Ram's problems are ultimately rooted in the deficiencies of a society shaped by brutal necessity, and I try to explore that, along with the many different ways you can acquire power in such a society, and what it does to you.

    Ratfic, I reckon, is all about character. Consistent world is more of requirement not the central theme. After all, if not for consistent world, how else our character can get their reward from acting rationally? From your description, I think you got it pat down. I'm interested.

      Just a friendly fyi, I believe the phrase is "you've got it down pat," as a pat down is something else entirely.
      ```

        Ah, LOL. I actually smirked yesterday in multiple occasion, "Finally I get to use that expression." I feel deflated today reading PM finding out I didn't type what I meant to type. Oh well...
        ```

      idk, I do feel that for many ratfics, there's an underlying exploration of the world.
      ```

      - u/sambelulek:
        ```
        If the world is not familiar to us, exposition (underlying exploration) is mandatory. Knowing how the world works make readers understand whether the characters make correct decisions, or ultimately, go the right way to solve problem. I'd love to quote Sanderson about magic & problem solving, but change magic to world, world & problem solving.

    I know i'm super late to the game, but be aware of the difference between rational fiction and rationlist fiction.

    The first is about consistency, characters (good and bad) not acting as morons just to forward the plot (if they aren't generally morons), worlds that take actions and give realistic consequences...etc. Which sounds be what you are talking about above.

    Rationalist is more focused towards talking about modes of thinking, techniques for applying rationality...etc in addition to the rules listed above. Which seems to be what you are worried about in this comment.

    So it sounds like a good fit to me.

  My, my. Technically well written, no glaring grammar mistakes, good world building, and understandable characters!

  Plus the characters act reasonably with realistic motivations. They're not wish fulfillingly clever nor are they dumb bricks for plot convenience. 

  That's really all that I can ask for in a rational fiction so thanks for this post! I'm on 3.2 right now and I have enjoyed the story so far. I'll be following it now. 

  I love the setting with the Mesopotamian influence and naming. I really appreciate when authors decide to use naming that goes beyond boring, overdone English names in Western Fantasy and actually dip into to countless other cultures that exist.

    Thank you very much, to you and to everyone else who gave/is giving/will give PB a shot!  The site's never seen this much traffic before.

  That is an impressively dysfunctional society. Ancient Sparta or Aztec Empire levels. This is not a complaint mind, just a "Wow, that is fucked up".
  ```

  - u/RedSheepCole:
    ```
    Well, that's what I was going for.  Glad to hear that I succeeded so beautifully.

  Spoilers ahead, I can't seem to get the tags working on mobile.






   It seems fairly clear to me that Ram himself was chosen by a spirit, rather than his sword.

  I wonder if he's the first of his kind.

  Also, I really want to see his "girlfriend" find out about the rumors he's spreading. My bet is she'd show him off as her boy toy to get back at him.


  So far it's excellently well written, and would absolutely be welcomed here if you posted whenever you dropped a new chapter.

  - u/RedSheepCole:
    ```
    Would it be appropriate to spoiler-tag any of that, or is it understood here that the comments section is fair game?
    ```

    - u/Iwasahipsterbefore:
      ```
      Ah, I thought you posted this as a chapter update, rather than a series introduction.

      That should probably be spoiler bound, I'll do it once I remember how.

  Seems interesting. Added to my list

  It would be nice to have the option to read on a dark background.

    I don't have a lot in the way of technical ability, unfortunately.  It took me an embarrassingly long time just to get the Wordpress site looking right.
    ```

  - u/CorneliusPhi:
    ```
    I read the whole story on a dark background.  You should be able to find a browser extension for that
    ```

    - u/LimeDog:
      ```
      Solution worked. Got Dark Reader extension.

  Sounds cool. I'll check it out :)

- u/lmbfan:

  That was very entertaining. Please post updates here, I am extremely interested to see what happens next, and for more of your excellent world building.

  Do you have a Patreon or other means of donating?

  Just read all of this, loving it. Would absolutely recommend. When's the next chapter coming out?
  ```

  - u/RedSheepCole:
    ```
    I post updates every Sunday evening, US Central time.  More or less; sometimes I'm a bit early.  Each update being a fifth of a chapter.  I'm told it works better as a binge read.  Thanks for reading.

    EDIT: Decided to post Chapter 6.1 slightly early.  It's up now.
    ```

- u/sambelulek:

  On my first read, I understand Kindling (once every 10 years period) as the high priest sacrifice himself, ending his life, thus his position is inherited by his son. Would that makes every son of priest must produce a son of their own at 10 years of age? Potential plot hole or did I read it wrong?
  ```

  - u/RedSheepCole:
    ```
    The sacrifice is every ten years, yes, and the position is hereditary/family based.  I think I will probably change it to "brother or son."  Or "kinsman" in general.  The age would crawl inexorably downwards over time with strict sonship, yes.

    (in the original draft of the story, kindling intervals were significantly longer)

    EDIT: Glossary updated to fix--and a number of other concepts added as well.  I think the monster's more than a hundred terms long now.  Anyway, thank you for bringing that to my attention!  I had a vague notion that I should fix that some time ago, but it slipped my mind.

  ```
  Just Finished first chapter. So far so good. Will there be any sort of romance in the series later on ?. I don't necessarily mean as a major subplot or anything. Just if MC will have a love interest.
  ```
