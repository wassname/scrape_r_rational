  Whenever I write one of these chapters where a piece of science or rationality is explained, I'm faced with a problem: First of all, HPMOR style lectures tend to slow down the pacing and takes the reader out of the story. But secondly, there really is no good justification for why Naruto would even know that kind of science to begin with. So instead you get the more realistically jumbled explanation you see here, which kind of hints at the principles behind reductionism but unfortunately doesn't really explain it to readers who don't already know what it is.

  If I had been writing a more scientifically advanced setting, I would have liked to explain the concept of a scientific explanation: Namely that instead of trying to think of reasons for why a phenomena should exist, the goal is to describe in the simplest possible terms what's going on at a fundamental level. The idea that describing \*how\* something works is exactly the same as explaining \*why\* it works is an incredibly important insight which I think even people with a scientific background don't really grog intuitively.

  There is another important rationalist lesson in this chapter, though: Whenever you want to explain something, start by asking yourself what your students want to actually use this knowledge for, and then take them through it step by step by showing them how to get there. If you don't, you end up with the kind of meaningless theoretical mumbo-jumbo that Naruto nearly subjected his audience to before Sasuke intervened.

  If only my past student self had been so lucky.

  Sasuke what are you planning...

  "Like Naruto said earlier, this period of fake peace is not going to last forever"

  That's some great paraphrasing Sasuke, except you weren't around when Naruto said it. I might be more inclined to believe that this is something benign like using the Sharingan to read naruto's lips, even though sasuke didn't seem to be in line of sight at the time, if not for the fact that moments later he preforms a similar feat, calling out Sakura for her knowledge of how the first hokage died. She is clearly surprised that Sasuke knows that she knows, so I doubt that she just told him earlier. 

  I have two theories on how Sasuke knows. He could be using the Sharingan to read their minds. The Sharingan can't do that in canon but the land of waves arc in NTBS sorta suggests that maybe it can in NTBS. Or Sasuke is spying on them, possibly with that hawk summon (we're explicitly told that Tsunade's room isn't sealed against observers).

  Further evidence that Sasuke is manipulating Naruto's plan comes in the form of Shino being there, even though Naruto didn't invite him, and Sasuke's influence could serve as an explanation for how Temari/Kankuro found out about it, though there are reasonable alternatives for both of these examples.

  Sasuke probably isn't being malicous with these plots. Having a strong trustworthy team of ninja to rely on when he tries to take down Itachi fits with his motives, but spying/reading the minds of his teammates is a bit less benign...

  EDIT: Am moron, not only has the author noted in a comment that there is strong evidence that the sharingan can read minds in canon, but in Chp 36  of NTBS it's explicitly stated that kakashi is reading Naruto's mind.
  "He looked into Narutoâ€™s mind once again, trying to see if there was anything else that might alarm him."

    As an addendum, it's unlikely that Hinata/Neji was reading Naruto's lips, since Neji didn't seem aware of Naruto's plan even though Naruto described it when he said the fake peace line. It's possible that I'm misinterpreting his statement, or that Hinata told Sasuke about Naruto's conversation non-verbally, but that wouldn't explain Sasuke knowing about how the first hokage died. (Hinata's byakugan can't possibly keep track of Sakura during all of her meetings with Tsunade).

    Well spotted! I was actually worried that people would be replying with "I noticed a mistake in this chapter..." since my track record for dropping subtle clues is not that great :p

    Without saying which if any of your interpretations is correct, I will note that the Sharingan being able to read minds is very much a canon thing. Not only does Sasuke use it to invade Naruto's mindspace to talk to Kurama, the entire first half of the fight between Sasuke and Itachi is literally them standing there motionlessly while they psychically communicate with each other using the Sharingan. And any rationalist worth their salt would realize that if you can psychically communicate, it's also possible to turn that information stream into one-way traffic with a bit of cleverness.

    Of course, you might point out that that's not so much a function of the Sharingan as it is of genjutsu in general, but the effect is the same either way.

  I was sort of lost for the past few chapters, had no idea where things were going, now with this one I think the story is back on track with what I like most, really excited for what comes next

  Damn, that cliffhanger. 

  Things are truly getting interesting now. I love the idea of Naruto getting everyone together in secret like this to try and improve techniques. One of the strengths of this story is it's unpredictability, I have no idea what you have in store next. Looking forward to the next chapter.
