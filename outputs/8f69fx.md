  I thought the beginning of threadbare was a fun idea, executed...adequately. Gave up about half through as it tried to broaden its scope and cast. Anyway, I bought the first book of the Dire series and am 30% of the way through the first novel. It’s mediocre so far. The main character is intriguing but the rest are fairly bland, very little has happened plot wise and I’m currently enduring some cliche ‘let’s guard our prisoners with zero competence and forethought’ nonsense.

  Soooo I guess threadbare's not getting a sequel then.

    Nah, it still is.  I'm pretty sure he wrote this while working on Threadbare and he's also currently writing Bunkercore.  Andrew Seiple puts out a lot of stuff.

  Is it good? How does it compare to Threadbare?

    The Dire series is currently one of my all time favorite super hero series. It features a protagonist that is usually rational, in that she always acts in what she believes to be a manner that furthers her interests. Whether those interests are achieving long-term goals of world optimization or appearing to be a laughably maniacal supervillain who CRUSHES ALL WHO DARE STAND BEFORE DIRE, she’s consistent. 

    Granted, there are some flaws, some intentional blind spots, etc, but over all...it’s just such. A fun. Read. 

    I haven’t read Hell, yet, but I am super excited to do so, and highly, _highly_ recommend the series. 

    In direct comparison with Threadbare:  I enjoyed the Dire series faaaar more. 

    EDIT: I enjoyed Threadbare as well, but not as much. Threadbare has some flavor inconsistencies that bothered me.

      How does it stand out versus other superhero stories? Worm, Legion of Nothing, With this Ring, and Life Ore Death, are the only ones I've had experience with up to this point.

          In case it wasn't clear from this, Doctor Dire's "superpower" is most similar to Worm's Tinkers.  She's a supergenius.

          Seconding the Dire Worm recommendation, it's a fun read.
