  From what I did read so far last time, it's not my cup of tea. It's not bad from what I read so far, but it wasn't really appealing.

  I am not even sure why you have a reincarnated character if Earth knowledge didn't really play any significant role to the story even if it's simple as 'germ theory' or vague knowledge of scientific concepts. I am not asking for an industrial revolution, which is an unlikely scenario.

  Anyway, what do I look for in fics nowday? 

  Support roles, less combat, civilization building, engineering, worldbuilding, logistics.

  Though I do make certain exceptions for fics that doesn't have any of those if they are sufficiently good.

    I have to agree, and SD in particular has a problem with taking absolutely forever to get anywhere. My view might be a little skewed because I tend to focus on plot to the exclusion of setting, but I still can't reccomend SD.

      There's another fic that I liked, [Leave of Grasses](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/leaves-of-grass-naruto-si.28246/) that does a much better job of using an Earth-born reincarnated character.

      There's not going to be an industrial revolution or anything like that, but you at least know that there's some Earth influences running in the MC, so the reincarnation isn't a pointless feature.

      It also managed to keep me interested despite the slow paced nature of the work. It's approaching eighty thousand words but I felt it's just the beginning. 

      So what is the difference between SD and Leaves of Grasses? If I have to summarize my gut feeling..it is that I don't care about SD, not the main character, the world, or even the side characters.

        Might I suggest [The Tales of Paul Twister](http://www.paultwister.com/lpt01/)? It's about a man who gets pulled into a fantasy world, his natural advantage is a personal antimagic field (which is also a disadvantage, as he's immune to for example healing magic), and he makes his way by being a profession cursebreaker and thief.

        He constantly uses names like Clark Kent and Bruce Wayne in order to see if anyone recognizes them, indicating they are from Earth.

        As a side project he started an academy of the sciences to start his own mini industrial revolution under the name Anthony Stark.

        It's a very good series.

          If I want an industrial revolution fic, there's [A Hero's War](https://www.fictionpress.com/s/3238329/82/A-Hero-s-War). 

          But I have yet to try out *The Tales of Paul Twister*.

  While the main character is kind of a dick, I find myself liking a lot of the side characters quite a bit. Tong Da Hai for example is basically Cool Old Master combined with Reasonable Authority Figure. Akanai is basically a more bloodthirsty and proactive Karin of the Heavy Wind from Zero no Tsukaima. Taduk is the Old Master with a quirky personality (Hare Supremacy and his darling daughter).

  Even Sumei and Mei Lin, the resident Tsundere and Genki Girls are alright, though I'm starting to root more for Adujan at this point.
