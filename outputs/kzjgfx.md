## Does anyone have a kind of list of rational, or rationalist, fic on royal road?

### Post:

The only that comes to my mind is RE Trailer Trash, and it's pretty good.

  Below is my follow list, not all rational but I get turned off by irrational things so you may enjoy them as well. I also do not keep up with all of them anymore:

    What do you think of Ar'Kendrithyst and Farming for Gold (sadly incomplete and riddled with typos)?

    Edit.  Also The Daily Grind and Worth the Candle.
    ```

    - u/Dragfie:
      ```
      > Farming for Gold / The Daily Grind

      Haven't tried, may be good. 
      > Ar'Kendrithyst

      The interactions between the dad and daughter made me physically cringe and I couldn't keep going - apparently it becomes more tragic later which I don't like anyway
      > WtC

      Yeah I like that, not following cos im not up-to-date. Don't know why its rated so low on RR, I'm assuming just cos of idiots. I have paused after the duel arc though because I don't like tragedy and feel like it will just go down hill from the high lol.
      ```

      - u/Way-a-throwKonto:
        ```
        Gotcha... What parts made you cringe? It's been such a long time since I read the first few chapters.

        It's weird, I can't really remember the tragedy, in fact it's basically wholesome to me.  There's great tragedies in the background though (the origin of Veird...).
        ```

        - u/Dragfie:
          ```
          Pretty much each line of dialogue between the daughter and the father in all the first chapters. Couldn't get past it.
          ```

    - u/meangreenking:
      ```
      Ar'Kendrithyst has both big supporters and big detractors in this sub. 

      Thus you may like it quite a bit or hate it. I would recommend giving it a try though to see which category you fall into. I personally think its a great read.
      ```

      - u/Way-a-throwKonto:
        ```
        Me too.

        It is a bit Mary Sue the degree to which Erick gets his powers and how his power level keeps ratcheting up, but... I still like it anyways!
        ```

        - u/Dragfie:
          ```
          Yeah, I didn't like it but I saw no objective reason to call it "bad" so don't let me stop anyone from trying XD
          ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Good one, bro, thank you.
    ```

  - u/TMGleep:
    ```
    If you enjoyed "I Became a [Biologist] in a Fantasy World!", then I strongly recommend "The Essence of Cultivation" by the same author (https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/34710/the-essence-of-cultivation), about a sort of D&D wizard that finds himself in a world of cultivators.

    The downside is that it's fairly short and on Hiatus, but other than that I found it really good and hopefully the author will resume it at some point.
    ```

- u/BardicKnowledgeCheck:
  ```
  Don't know of a master list. 

  I think Mother of Learning qualifies in spades. 

  To me, litrpg =/= rational, but if you like those I found delve and seaborn to be good candidates among lots of trash. I award points on the worldbuilding being rational and put the protagonists in the middle of the pack for rationality. (They're no Ender or HPEVP, but they try, and you can make a good argument for rationality as well as pointing out many many flaws)
  Both are incomplete and ongoing. 

  Can't think of any others right now, but I'd love to read what anyone else would put on a rational list.

  patchwork realms is another I think
