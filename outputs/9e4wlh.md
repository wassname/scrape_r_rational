## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  Consider a DnD game with a theme similar to rocks fall, everyone dies, of DM vs the player. Here it's a simulationist world and the DM is not allowed to contradict themself or they lose. On the other hand, if there is any fact about the world that the players haven't searched for, then the DM is free to change it however they wish. Players must counteract this by collecting information (in-world) and putting the DM on the spot to demand information and prevent the DM from later adding threats Ad-hoc. 

  challenges:

  1. There must be some other limitation on the DM so they can't start the game with an inbound meteor, etc, etc. What limitations can we put that will maintain the spirit of the game? Some variation of 'all problems can be solved'?

  2. What strategies will each side employ? Eg. players could keep a checklist of things to confirm before a mission, what would be on it?

    I think this is a matter of one person cuts the cake, the other chooses the slice.

    *First challenge* - Only one limitation: Do the players consider the death fair?

    This is deliberately flexible. The softer the rules the weaker the lawyers and the stronger the juries.

    Not is it fun, not is it logical... is it *fair*? This was always what jostled around in my head while I was plotting to do something to one or another of my players that they were really going to hate. The best way is to have it be their own faults, to trick them into making a choice that led to the things they would hate. But if it had to happen outside their control? Match backstory they've created, match it as an echo of something they've already experienced in-game... and as disaster develops, make them perfectly aware that *they should know better*.

    The players decide if it's fair. The cake is cut as best the DM can.

    *Second challenge* - Assuming the above system: Pay attention.

    The DM pays attention to holes in the players' defenses, launches light warnings and luring them into false senses of security. Lots of false senses of security. The DM lobs some softballs in order to make them think they're dodging bullets. Some of these are giant softballs, and they are set on fire. Wow that was fair, but we survived it, the players say. The DM learns what each player thinks "fair" means. The DM learns what each player tends to pay attention to. Then the DM kills them all at once so nobody feels especially self-righteous and singled-out.

    Easier to accept "We're all dead, let's play something else" than "I'm dead, good luck guys."

    Players need to be be on the lookout for clues, because the DM will be dropping clues. When there are clues, the players must REACT to them. Also, give the DM as little information as possible while demanding as much information as possible. Each player only has to think of one character, the DM has to keep track of everything. Push that imbalance hard.

    ...

    Eh, doesn't sound like a lot of fun to me if that's all there is. Still, it works reasonably well as a small scale way to implement interesting story beats and stakes when players know the all the D&D rules.

    My answer to challenge 1: Any threat the DM throws at the player must take **at least one turn after being introduced** to kill the players - they cannot be 100% blindsided. For instance, the DM cannot say, "A meteor hits you and you die", but they *can* say, "A meteor will hit you in one turn! You have to do something!"

     In addition, any threat the DM creates must have a **reasonable solution given the time frame**. So, if the meteor is approaching, the party must, given what's available to them, have a way to stop the meteor before it hits them that has already been introduced. This would allow for serial escalation of threats (maybe something the players already saw and overcame can be used in some fashion, like using a giant monster to block the meteor) or anything they've already found like a shield spell can be used.

    What makes it reasonable? Well, the DM could in theory come up with a meteor which they decide can only be stopped if one member of the party stands on one foot, licks a kitten, and then quotes the entirety of the DM's favorite song, but that's obviously not something they could ever come up with in time unless very blatant hints were dropped earlier.

    Challenge 2:

    How would the party take on this challenge? They'd come up with anything they can think of that would help against basically any threat, and start demanding answers of the DM about it. The more they know about the setting, the better, after all! It would be especially helpful to ask about absolutes, such as, "Does this spell block all attacks?" It would help lead the DM to contradict themselves if they accidentally say, "The monster has a special attack which bypasses the spell!" because now it no longer blocks all attacks and the players win.

    The DM, on the other hand, would be best served by coming up with as many obscure exceptions as possible. They can change anything the players don't ask about, to be sure, but having a contingency in place before the game even starts would likely serve them even better. In the case of the monster with a special attack, the DM can respond to their question with, "It can block nearly any kind of attack" - emphasis on *nearly*. The more loopholes and exceptions to the rule the DM has on hand, the better.

      this is an interesting munchkin challenge to balance, but in general, I'm not masochistic enough to spend my leisure time with a DM  who wants to be an opponent.  If your DM wants to kill all of you, either you've seriously broken a social convention, or you are sitting at the wrong table.
      ```

      - u/Kesseleth:
        ```
        I figured that this *was* the game. As in, it's not literally Dungeons and Dragons where the DM is masochistic, it's a game like DnD which deliberately pits the DM and the players against each other in a test of wits.

    > There must be some other limitation on the DM so they can't start the game with an inbound meteor, etc, etc. What limitations can we put that will maintain the spirit of the game?

    The game designer has provided an introductory paragraph that the DM has to read aloud at the start (and thus they can't contradict it). This sets the scene and establishes a normal setting where the air isn't made of acid or anything. A normal, completely mundane bird is chirping nearby, and it will definitely not die within the next week (ruling out a lot of large scale catastrophes). (Maybe you want a clause in there that makes the players not want to kill the bird to contradict the DM, but maybe not.)

  All people in the world (two variants - either currently living or born after some point, like 1950, even if they are dead now) gain the power to return their current consciousness and memory to any point of their life up to current moment, overwriting their previous state. They all become aware of this power, and can use it instantaneously, including the moment of death, however sudden it might be. After that point on your "individual timeline" where you become aware you can always use it, but you can't teach it to other people if you go back. Unless they are already a time-traveled future version, in which case they will already know it. Going to the future is not possible, you'll need to age with normal speed again. You'll need to specify either the date or event you remember to go back. If you change anything in your life (and you most likely will, because you won't remember all the details if you don't have perfect memory (your memory degrades with "normal" speed depending on your current brain state)), the "history" changes. Everyone can change history absolutely independently, noone remembers whatever was in other people futures if they were affected by changes. For example, if you return to the point before you meet someone with whom you had relationship, and don't go to the place where you met, they won't remember you at all.

  It could be imagined as this: we have some state of the world. It develops from the this state until someone decides to go back. After this the world develops from the moment that person returned to, but with them making possibly different choices. If someone wants to live an endless hedgehog day, noone will notice that, because as long as they let go of it in less than infinite number of loops, the world will move on.

  I'm interested in how the world would change and what kind of society it would stabilize on, and also how you could exploit that power. The mundane uses are pretty obvious - you can rectify any mistake, if you want to spend time aging again. Looking deeper, you can have pretty much endless life experiences, if you are okay with becoming young again and again, though eventually you'll forget most of them. 

  The most difficult thing is the conflict between individuals. If someone shoots you, you can go back for a couple seconds and dodge, but then they will go back and adjust their aim, and so on. Someone old could go back and try to take over the world, but when the time will catch to the "moment of awareness", someone will immediately go back and try to stop them, unless they've build the perfect totalitarian society with mind control. The only way to prevent someone from messing with your plans is to change their mind on the problem before they wanted to oppose you, or to kill them before they get the power for the first time, but then you will deal with consequences of your crime.

  I suppose at first some people will instantly go far back and become millionaires with future knowledge and technologies, but then more and more people will do that, so it should balance out somewhere. Also every possible technology and knowledge will eventually drift back to the time of conscious age of the oldest person.

  How the world will look eventually, when everyone is content with state of things?
